    "linear polymers are examples of soft - matter systems consisting of a series of identical , or similar , covalently - bonded subunits ( monomers ) .",
    "the fundamental physical properties of a polymer , such as its size and flexibility , strongly depend on its polymerization degree , that is the number of constituting monomers .",
    "because of steric hindrance and electrostatic self - repulsion , short polymer chains can be aptly described as rigid molecules . on the other hand ,",
    "when the number of monomers in a chain is sufficiently large , polymers are highly flexible and , in canonical equilibrium , explore a large number of conformations that are typically highly self - entangled .    for individual open polymer chains",
    "this entanglement is purely geometrical ; in fact , a knot in the chain can be untied by a suitable reptation of the polymer in space .",
    "on the other hand , if a closure ( cyclization ) reaction occurs , or if the polymer termini are otherwise constrained , then the geometrical self - entanglement is trapped in the form of a knot ( possibly a trivial knot , that is a ring ) , whose topology can not be changed by any manipulation of the polymer except by cutting it .",
    "topological entanglement is a genuine characteristic of polymeric systems that , in some circumstances , may severely affect not only the physical properties of individual polymer chains , but also of polymer melts .",
    "for example , entanglement can be trapped during the crystallization of artificial polymers , and determine the properties of the resulting crystal , such as its degree of purity  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the entanglement colocalizes with amorphous regions of the crystal .",
    "artificial knotted polymer rings can be , nowadays , easily synthesized in laboratory but their most ubiquitous and pervasive manifestation is found in biopolymers such as dna and rna .",
    "these biomolecules can be sufficiently long that they become entangled _ in vivo",
    "_  @xcite , thus providing an ideal playground to study the occurrence of knots and their biological implications .",
    "for example , knots and other entanglements in dna are known to severely affect the efficiency of fundamental genetic events such as replication and transcription  . the biological necessity to maintain a control on the degree of entanglement of these biomolecules _ in vivo _ is highlighted by the fascinating fact that there exist specific cellular machineries , such as topoisomerase enzymes , which are capable of simplifying the topological complexity of the dna entanglement by favouring the selective cross - passage of pairs of dna strands  @xcite .",
    "as illustrated by the above - mentioned examples , topological entanglement is a ubiquitous aspect in polymer systems and has important ramifications either in technological contexts or for the understanding of complex physical and/or biological systems .",
    "the objective of this review is to provide an overview of the salient advancements that have been made in the past decades in the theoretical and computational characterization of topological entanglement in polymeric systems . in this regard",
    ", it should be mentioned that most of the latest developments have been stimulated by the advent of single - molecule manipulation techniques that have redefined the `` hot '' open problems and applicative horizons of polymer entanglement .",
    "we mention , in particular , the perspectives opened by the possibility of confining one or more polymer chains in nano - pores , nano - channels or through surface adsorption as well as that of mechanically manipulating individual polymeric filaments .",
    "the topics covered by the present review may broadly be collected into four main sections which cover respectively : ( i ) the fundamental notions of entanglement and polymer models , the state - of - the - art characterization of ( ii ) self - entanglement of individual polymers and ( iii ) several polymer chains in `` topological equilibrium '' and finally ( iv ) the behaviour of one or more fluctuating polymers of fixed topology . for each section , we provide not only an up - to - date account of available results , but also a full overview of the main methodological ( theoretical and computational ) tools that can be profitably used to attack the state - of - the - art problems .",
    "finally , we provide a perspective for future research by highlighting the key open questions .",
    "the first part of the review consists of sections  [ knot_theory]  [ pol_models ] and aims at providing the reader with an overview of :    * the main topological concepts , * the polymer models that are most - commonly studied theoretically or computationally , * the methods and algorithms used to characterize the degree of polymer entanglement .    in the literature",
    "there are several models of polymer chains in solution and we will review some of them by pointing out advantages and drawbacks .",
    "a common , essential feature of these models is that they neglect the chemical details of the monomers as much as possible and describe the polymer in terms of a discrete ( coarse - grained ) chain made by the repetition , in a string - like fashion , of the elementary monomeric subunits .",
    "ideally , viable models ought to be simple enough to be theoretically tractable and yet sufficiently detailed to capture the key characteristics of the macromolecule in equilibrium such as its connectivity , its local rigidity and its flexibility at large scales .    at the simplest level of model complexity one",
    "has the so called _ ideal chains _ where only the chain connectivity and local stiffness are considered . in these models ,",
    "the polymer chain is typically embedded in the continuum three - dimensional space , and self - avoidance is not accounted for .",
    "this leaves the chain free to attain configurations that would be incompatible with steric hindrance , such as those where distinct chain nodes or bonds are overlapping .",
    "the minimalistic character of these models make them amenable to extensive analytical characterization and to straightforward numerical simulations , see section  [ pol_models ] .",
    "more realistic descriptions of the polymer do take into account the excluded - volume constraint in the chain , these constraints introduce long - range ( along the chemical sequence ) correlations in the system which make analytical progress very difficult . as a consequence",
    ", these models are almost exclusively characterised by means of computationally - intensive numerical simulations .",
    "the scope of the latter is often extended by reducing the conformational degrees of freedom of the model polymer , for example by embedding the chain on a regular lattice .    in section  [ knot_theory ]",
    "we finally provide a concise summary of the key concepts needed to define and characterize the topological entanglement of a closed chain ( and discuss to what extent it can be extended to open linear chains ) which is at the heart of the modern branch of topology known as the _ knot theory_. interested readers can find a more systematic and in - depth coverage of the concepts and results introduced below , in one of the several books that have been published on the subject , see e.g. refs .",
    "an operational definition of a knotted curve can be given by resorting to our common experience of taking a piece of rope , tying a knot in it and finally gluing the two ends together .",
    "the knotted rope can be geometrically manipulated in three - dimensional space ( @xmath0 ) in countless ways but , unless we use scissors and glue to cut and rejoin the rope , it is impossible to turn it into a plain , unknotted ring .",
    "the above example builds on our intuitive notion that a rope has an approximately uniform thickness that forbids the rope self - crossing during the manipulations .",
    "since all the configurations obtained by deforming the rope preserve the initial knot type , it appears natural to define a knot as the class of equivalence of configurations obtained by these manipulations in the three - dimensional embedding space .",
    "mathematically it is appealing to define a knot in a similar fashion , that is as the set of continuous simple closed curves ( i.e. @xmath1 ) that are related by continuous deformations in @xmath0 ( isotopy ) .",
    "however , in contrast with our practical example , a curve in @xmath1 has no thickness so that , based on the above definition , any knot would be found equivalent to the unknot .",
    "this is readily seen by considering the continuous deformation resulting from pulling the curve tighter and tighter until the knot reduces to a point and hence disappears ( see figure  [ fig : singular_knot ] ) .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by basing the knot equivalence on the notion of _ ambient isotopy_. an ambient isotopy is a geometrical manipulation of the curve ( isotopy ) through the space in which the curve is embedded ( ambient ) . in other words , instead of deforming the knots alone",
    ", one deforms the whole space in which they sit .",
    "these deformations preserve the orientation of the curve and do not allow the occurrence of instances such as the one depicted in figure  [ fig : singular_knot ] in which the knot has been shrinked down to a point .",
    "this restriction is sufficient to rule out the occurrence of singularities , such as the one shown in figure  [ fig : singular_knot ] , as the result of a continuous deformation of a curve .    yet",
    ", it appears necessary to introduce restrictions also on the types of admissible curves in order to disallow the occurrence of `` pathological '' cases such as the one depicted in figure  [ fig : wild_knot ] and known as _",
    "wild knots_. these cases , that are very far from the intuitive , physical notions of a proper knot , can be ruled out by requiring the curves to be differentiable .",
    "this severe constraint is impractical in the discrete polymer models used in standard numerical studies . in this situation",
    "the constraint is relaxed by defining a knot as a simple , closed curve that is ambient isotopic to a piecewise - linear ( or polygonal ) curve in @xmath0 ( _ tame knot _ )  @xcite .",
    "this definition eliminates wild knotting because polygonal curves are necessarily composed of a finite number of bonds or edges . within the space of polygonal curves , two configurations are topologically equivalent ( or ambient isotopic ) if one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of _ triangular moves _ ( see figure  [ fig : triangular_moves ] ) .",
    "detecting knot equivalences is at the heart of knot theory .",
    "for instance , proving that it is impossible to deform one knot into another is equivalent to proving that the two knots lie in different equivalence classes . on the other hand proving that a knot is not trivial i.e. that no ambient isotopy can move it into a perfectly planar ring is equivalent to showing that it does not belong to the equivalence class of the unknot .",
    "another way of detecting the knot type of a closed polygonal curve with a definite arrangement ( embedding ) in @xmath2 space consists of looking at its planar representation , i.e. its _ knot diagram_. knot diagrams are planar projections of the three - dimensional curve embedding whose only singularities are transverse double points at which the _ underpass - overpass _ information is given by interrupting one of the branches of the projected curves . in this mapping",
    "a movement of an embedding in @xmath0 corresponds to a change in its planar projection . for this description",
    "there is a well established theorem stating that two knots are equivalent if and only if ( any of ) their projections can be made identical by a sequence of three possible _",
    "reidemeister moves _",
    "@xcite and planer isotopies ( see figure  [ fig : reideimeister ] ) .",
    "each knot diagram is characterized by a set of transversely crossings whose number depends on the particular projection direction and on the specific geometric realization of the knot type . by using reidemeister",
    "moves one can , in principle , minimise the number of crossings compatible with the topology of that knot type .",
    "this gives rise to a minimal knot diagram representation of that knot type having the smallest possible number of crossings @xmath3 ( _ crossing number _ ) .        as a matter of fact ,",
    "if we neglect chiral enantiomers ( see section  [ chirality ] below for a proper definition ) , the value of @xmath3 provides the most used criterion for classifying knots in groups of increasing topological complexity .",
    "an unknotted curve is , in fact , associated to @xmath4 . at the next level of complexity one has the trefoil knot , which has @xmath5 etc .",
    ", as shown in figure  [ fig : knots_table ] .",
    "as @xmath3 increases one finds topologically different knots having the same number of minimal crossings which are conventionally distinguished by a different numerical subscript appended to @xmath3 .",
    "the simplest example is offered by the pair of 5-crossing knots , @xmath6 and @xmath7 sketched in figure  [ fig : knots_table ] .    .",
    "]      as common experience teaches us , a non - trivial knot @xmath8 in a rope can not be untied by introducing a second non - trivial knot @xmath9 in different portion of the same rope ( that is a portion that does not interfere with the first knot ) , no matter how one manipulates the doubly - knotted rope ( with closed or otherwise constrained ends ) .",
    "the notion that anti - knots do not exists can be actually proved rigorously by using geometrical techniques ( see section  [ geometry ] below ) .",
    "a further result is that the resulting knot , @xmath10 , belongs to a knot type that is different from both @xmath8 and @xmath9 and is called the _ connected sum _ or the _ composite knot _ of the two original knots .",
    "the two knots in the sum are called _ factors _ of @xmath10 .",
    "the notion of composite knots is very important as is leads to the concept of a _ prime _",
    "knot i.e. of a non - trivial knot that can not be decomposed into a non - trivial connected sum .",
    "in other words , if a prime knot @xmath8 is equivalent to the connected sum @xmath11 this implies that either @xmath9 or @xmath12 are unknots .    the basic facts about connected sums are that : ( i ) the operation is commutative ( i.e. @xmath13 ) and ( ii ) that each non trivial knot has a unique and finite factorization into prime knots .",
    "for this reason standard knot tables , see for example the knot table in  @xcite , lists only prime knots ( some of which can have two types of handedness , see next section ) . the simplest prime knots , those with @xmath14 are shown in figure  [ fig : knots_table ] while the simplest composite knots , which are clearly generated by the connecting two trefoil knots are given in figure  [ fig : connect_sum ] .",
    "an important fact is that the number of prime knots existing at a given value of @xmath3 grows exponentially with @xmath3   this rapid growth is reflected in the fact that presently available exhaustive tables of prime knots ( minimal representations ) exist only for knots with up to @xmath15 crossings  @xcite . for special knot families , such as the alternating knots",
    "described later on , there exists tables of up to 22 crossings  @xcite .",
    "an important notion in knot theory is _ chirality _ , or _",
    "suppose we look at a knot in a mirror .",
    "is the mirror image equivalent to the original one or not ? as an example let us consider the trefoil knot and its mirror image in figure  [ fig : trefoil_mirror ] .",
    "the  right handed \" knot of ( panel _ b _ ) can not be continuously deformed into the  left - handed \" version shown in panel _",
    "a_. for this reason , the trefoil knot is said to be _ topologically chiral_. the homotopy inequivalence of the two chiral versions of the trefoil was first proved in 1914 by m. dehn . by contrast",
    "if a knot can be continuously deformed into its mirror image we say that the knot is _ topologically achiral _ , or simply achiral ( see for example the @xmath16 knot in figure  [ fig : figure_eight_mirror ] ) .",
    "( a ) to its mirror image ( d ) by smooth deformation .",
    "( b ) rearrange the red part of the curve .",
    "( c ) rotate the knot by @xmath17 . ]",
    "achiral knots are relatively rare .",
    "indeed among the first @xmath18 prime knots in the knot table less than a @xmath19 are achiral @xmath20 ; all @xmath21 @xmath22-crossings knots are chiral and only @xmath23 of a total of @xmath24 @xmath25-crossings knots are achiral .",
    "the knot nomenclature introduced before is clearly incapable of distinguishing enantiomers , as they have the same minimal crossing number . for prime knots with 7 or less crossings",
    ", the enantiomers can be distinguished by computing the balance of left- and right - handed crossings in the _ minimal diagram_. to do so , it is first required to assign an orientation to the knot diagram ] .",
    "the handedness of each crossing is assigned by the right - hand rule applied to the oriented over- and under - passing segments as shown in figure  [ fig : cross_sign ] .",
    "the overall chirality is then established by assigning a `` + 1 '' value to right - handed crossings and `` -1 '' to the others and then taking the algebraic summation of the crossing signs .",
    "a right- and left - handed trefoil would therefore be associated to signed crossing numbers equal to + 3 and -3 , respectively . the resulting + /-",
    "sign of the summation can be appended to the knot name to distinguish the two types of enantiomers .",
    "for example the right- and left - handed enantiomers of the trefoil are denoted respectively by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we stress that the above rule is formulated for the minimal diagram representation of prime knots with less than 8 minimal crossings and alternating knots ( see next subsection ) but can fail for an abritrary diagram of these knots . in general",
    ", the rule will fail even for minimal diagram representations of prime knots , as pointed out by a. perko  @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind these important limitations , the chirality of connected sum of different prime knots can be suggested by the sign of the summed crossings in the minimal diagram . for example",
    "the composite knots @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two enantiomers of the granny knot while the knot @xmath30 is achiral and is called the _",
    "square knot_.    the concept of signed crossings can be also used to discuss the minimal topological changes that can be applied to a given knot to turn it into an unknot . within a minimal knot diagram representation",
    "it is easy to realize that one can convert a knot into the unknot by reversing one or more crossings in the knot diagram .",
    "for example the trefoil knot in its simplest form has only three crossings , and by changing in one of these crossing the under - passing strand into the overpassing one and vice - versa , we obtain the unknot . in general , for a given knot diagram it is always possible to find a set of crossings that can be switched over to obtain the unknot .",
    "on the other hand , for each knot diagram there can be several possible choices of crossings that can lead to the unknot .",
    "moreover the number of crossing changes required might depend on the diagram .",
    "it is then natural to define the _ unknotting number _ as the minimum ( taken over all possible knot diagrams ) number of crossing reversals needed to turn a given knot into the unknot  @xcite .",
    "there is no simple relation of the unknotting number to the minimal number of crossings of a knot . for example , the trefoil and figure eight knots both have unknotting number 1 .",
    "of the two five - crossing knots , @xmath7 has unknotting number 1 and @xmath6 has unknotting number 2 .",
    "the granny knot has unknotting number 2 ( essentially because each trefoil has to be unknotted ) .",
    "it turns out that if a knot has unknotting number 1 then it is automatically prime  @xcite , but the converse is not true .",
    "a natural generalization of the above scheme is the definition of the minimum number of crossing changes required to convert one given knot into another one .",
    "this number provides a distance in the space of knots .",
    "general topological considerations can be used to provide upper and lower bounds for knot distances which , in fact , are known exactly only for a limited subsets of knot pairs @xcite .",
    "a recent practical application of this distance in knot space has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite in connection with the topoisomerase action on circular dna .",
    "( left ) and a diagram of the same knot that is not alternating . ]    as anticipated , prime knots can be partitioned in families according to salient topological indicators , such as the minimal number of crossings .",
    "an important one is the _ alternating knots _ , that is knots admitting a minimal diagrammatic representation where under and over crossings alternate along the path .",
    "note that not all diagrams of an alternating knot need to possess the alternating properties described above , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : alternating ] .",
    "interestingly , most of the simplest types of knots , that is those with sufficiently small crossing number , are alternating .",
    "in fact , all prime knots with crossing number smaller than 8 are alternating , with the simplest non - alternating instance being the @xmath31 knot .",
    "( a ) torus knot ( b).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] ( b ) torus knot ( b).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    with the exception of the unknot no other knot can be drawn on the surface of a sphere without self - intersections .",
    "notably , there is a class of knots that , nevertheless , can be drawn as a simple closed curve on the surface of a standardly embedded ( i.e. unknotted ) torus .",
    "this is the family of _ torus knots_.    as an example we show in figure  [ fig : torus_knot ] the trefoil as a ( 2,3)-torus knot : the knot is shown to wind around the torus for @xmath32 times longitudinally and @xmath33 times meridionally ( a meridian being a circle bounding the disc inside the torus ) .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 numbers can be positive or negative depending on the orientation of the winding directions and fully classify the @xmath36-torus knot .",
    "basic properties of such knots are :    * @xmath34 and @xmath35 must be relatively prime ; and @xmath35 are not relatively prime one obtains links ( see subsection [ linking ] for definition ) . ] * a @xmath36-torus knot is topologically equivalent to a @xmath37-torus knot ; * if @xmath34 or @xmath35 is @xmath38 or @xmath39 the curve is unknotted ; * the mirror image of a @xmath36 torus knot is a @xmath40 torus . in other words all the non - trivial torus knots are chiral .",
    "a number of exact results have been proven for torus knots .",
    "two noteworthy ones regard the minimal crossing number and the unknotting number . for torus knots",
    "@xmath36 , the former is given by to @xmath41  @xcite while the uknotting number is is given by the simple formula @xmath42",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can also use geometrical quantities to characterize knots .",
    "the boundary of a punctured sphere is necessarily the unknot . if , on the other hand , we puncture a higher genus surface ( e.g. a torus ) the boundary curve can be knotted . in fact",
    "there is a well established theorem saying that every knot is the boundary of an orientable surface .",
    "the proof consists of an explicit construction first derived by seifert and the orientable surface is called a _ seifert surface _ of the knot ( see figure  [ fig : seifert ] for a sketch of the seifert surface of the trefoil ) .",
    "a knot can have many seifert surfaces .",
    "the lowest genus ( orientable ) seifert surface of a knot defines the _ genus _ of that knot .",
    "for instance the trefoil and figure eight knots both have genus 1 since they can each be the boundary curve of a punctured torus .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that genus adds under the connected sum operation so the granny knot has genus 2 . as a by - product one has the important result that a knot can not be untied by connecting it to another non - trivial knot . in other words",
    "anti - knots can not exist .",
    "it is important to distinguish between the genus @xmath43 of a knot ( related to be the boundary of a genus-@xmath43 surface ) and its possibility of lying on a standardly embedded surface of genus @xmath44 .",
    "for example the figure - eight knot has genus @xmath38 but it can not be placed on a unknotted torus ( surface with @xmath45 ) ; it can lie however on a standardly embedded surface with @xmath46 .",
    "one of the fundamental open problems in knot theory is to devise general schemes for establishing whether two given knots are equivalent or not .",
    "the use of sophisticated `` motion planning '' computational algorithms have proved useful in past years to aid the geometrical simplification of knots to a minimal , or otherwise unique  @xcite , conformation which can then be straightforwardly used to establish topological equivalence",
    ". however , the geometrical embedding of even an unknotted closed curve in @xmath0 can , in fact , be so entangled that the simplification to a planar loop is impractical .",
    "this may indeed be impossible for unknotted polygonal curves deformed by moves preserving the length of their edges @xcite .    a powerful strategy , alternative to the geometrical simplification , consists of associating to each knot type an _ invariant _ quantity whose value is unaffected by topology - preserving geometrical manipulations of the curves .",
    "in this way if the value of the invariant differs for two different embeddings ( or diagrams ) , then the two embeddings have different knot types .",
    "some invariants that have been obtained by studying the three - dimensional manifold left after the knot is removed from space , are _ the knot group _ , the _ topology of branched and unbranched covering spaces _ and the properties of _ seifert surfaces _  @xcite",
    ".    nevertheless , these very precise invariants are not very useful in applied numerical contexts , where it is typically necessary to identify the knot type of thousands or millions of rings . for such purposes",
    "it is customary to resort to invariants which are computed combinatorially from knot diagrams and put in the algebraic form as polynomials .",
    "perhaps the best known knot polynomial invariant is the _",
    "alexander polynomial_. the latter is defined in terms of a single variable @xmath47 and is computed starting from a given diagram according to the following general algorithm :    1 .",
    "attach an orientation to the diagram and establish the sign of each crossing using the right - hand rule , as in figure  [ fig : cross_sign ] .",
    "2 .   assign a progressive numbering index to the @xmath48 arcs of the diagrams and ( separately ) to the @xmath48 crossings .",
    "3 .   define an @xmath49 matrix @xmath50 .",
    "the elements of the @xmath51th row of @xmath50 are calculated by considering the @xmath52 crossing in the diagram and the three arcs , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 taking part to the crossing .",
    "for definiteness we shall assume that the @xmath56 arc passes over arcs @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "all elements of the @xmath52 row of @xmath50 are set to zero except for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "these three entries are calculated as follows : 1 .   if the crossing @xmath51 is positive then @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "if the crossing is negative then set @xmath60 , @xmath63 and @xmath64  .",
    "+ iterating the procedure for all crossings the matrix is completely defined .    deleting any one of these columns and",
    "any one row yields a @xmath65 matrix .",
    "this is the _ alexander matrix _ associated to a given diagram .",
    "the determinant of the alexander matrix ( which is therefore a minor of @xmath50 ) is the desired alexander polynomial , @xmath66 @xcite .    .",
    "the top panel shows the knot diagram with a given orientation : @xmath67 denotes the @xmath56 crossing ( found as one goes around the diagram along the given orientation ) whereas @xmath68 the arc between two consecutive undercrossings .",
    "each crossing of the diagram is then drawn separately and coded according to the arcs involved taken with their orientation . from these @xmath69 coded crossings it possible to calculate the elements of the matrix @xmath70 according to the algorithm described in the text . by deleting the last column and row one obtains the @xmath71 alexander matrix associated to the starting oriented knot diagram .",
    "the determinant of this matrix gives the alexander polynomial .",
    "note that in this example a term @xmath47 can be factorized out of the diagram . ]",
    "the calculation of the alexander polynomial for the five - crossing prime knot @xmath7 is illustrated in figure  [ fig : alexander_5_2 ] .",
    "strictly speaking , the alexander polynomial is not uniquely defined for a given knot type .",
    "this is evident because the size of the matrix , @xmath50 , and hence the determinant , depend of the number of crossings and hence on the details of a given diagrammatic representation .",
    "it turns out that the alexander polynomials of two different diagrammatic representations of the same knot type can differ only by a multiple of @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "this ambiguity is immaterial if one computes @xmath74 , which is indeed a topological invariant .",
    "this ambiguity , which is immaterial if one computes the topological invariant @xmath74 , is however present if the value of the polynomial is calculated for other values of @xmath47 . by factoring out and removing the @xmath75 contribution one obtains a polynomial that is independent on the chosen projection of the knot .",
    "this gives the so called _ irreducible _ alexander polynomial .",
    "for example in the typical case of @xmath76 the algorithm returns the number @xmath77 , @xmath73 . to deal with this ambiguity one can find the largest value of @xmath78 such that the product @xmath79 is an odd integer . with a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "it is customary to use the notation @xmath66 also for the irreducible alexander polynomial .",
    "the alexander polynomial satisfies a number of properties including :    1 .",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 can differ only by factors of @xmath82 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath83 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath84 is equivalent to @xmath85 .",
    "for example , since the alexander polynomials of @xmath86 and @xmath16 are respectively @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we have for the granny knot @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the first property can be used to check the correctness of a calculated polynomial .",
    "for example , no correct calculation can return the polynomial @xmath91 , because @xmath92 is not in the form @xmath93 and property @xmath38 is not satisfied .",
    "the alexander polynomial is relatively easy to implement on a computer and it is often used in detecting the knot type of a large number of configurations obtained by stochastic sampling , for example .",
    "there are however some shortcomings in using the alexander polynomial as a knot detector .",
    "first , and most importantly , the alexander polynomial can not distinguish between knots and their mirror images .",
    "second , there are several pairs of knot types having the same alexander polynomial . for instance , the ( irreducible ) alexander polynomial of knot @xmath94 is @xmath95 , which is identical to the polynomial of the granny knot @xmath96 while @xmath97 has the same alexander polynomial as @xmath98",
    ". the ambiguity can be even more dramatic in the sense that non - trivial knots can have the same alexander determinant of the unknot .",
    "the simplest of such knots are the kinoshita - terasaka knot and its mutant , the conway knot , which have minimal crossing number equal to @xmath99 .",
    "other polynomials are known which are better discriminants of knots .",
    "for example the jones polynomial , the homfly polynomial ( see  @xcite for a simple introduction ) and the vassiliev invariants are known to be sensitive to knot chirality and to distinguish a large class of knots that can not be distinguished by the alexander polynomial . however , also for these polynomials there are known examples of topologically inequivalent knots having the same polynomials .",
    "for example the two knots in figure  [ fig : homfly_fail ] have the same homfly polynomial .",
    "even the proof that at least one of the known invariants is a perfect detector of chirality or non - triviality is an open issue and there may exists non trivial knots for which all the known polynomials are trivial .",
    "an additional drawback of these more sophisticated knot polynomials is that their computational cost increases dramatically with the number of crossings in the diagram .",
    "for this reason , if one is interested in performing a detailed investigation of the knot complexity in random loops , a strong reduction of @xmath100 is recommended before computing these invariants .",
    "the reduction of @xmath100 for a given embedding is , in general , a highly non trivial task to perform .",
    "stochastic algorithms have been recently introduced to tackle this problem and some of them are reviewed in section  [ knot_simp ] .      in various contexts ,",
    "the notion of knottedness is loosely transferred to open curves . strictly speaking",
    "this is inappropriate because a piece of curve is topologically equivalent to a linear segment , no matter how many knots have been tied in . indeed , an appropriate set of manipulations of the open curve can lead to the untying of the knots .",
    "it is , nevertheless , a common experience that these operations can be lengthy and complicated and ultimately the characteristics of the curve in terms of its spatial arrangement or fluctuation dynamics are very much affected by its degree of entanglement .    to characterize the latter a `` virtual closure '' of the open chain",
    "is often introduced so that the usual topological indicators of knottedness can be used to specify the degree of self - entanglement .",
    "several closure procedures are possible .",
    "the simplest one is the end - to - end closure obtained by bridging the two ends with one segment .",
    "the amount of spurious entanglement introduced by this closure depends on the proximity of the chain ends .",
    "if their spatial separation is small compared to the chain radius of gyration then the entanglement added by the end connector is typically negligible .",
    "the opposite is true when the connector length is large .    to deal with the latter case it is preferable to prolong the chain ends `` at infinity '' so that they can be connected by an arc not intersecting the original chain .",
    "if the knots are localised in a small portion of the chain , then the detected topological state will not depend significantly on the specific closure procedure .",
    "other situations , for example when the chain attains a globular shape with one or both ends tucked inside , the result will depend on the closure scheme .",
    "these ambiguities have motivated the introduction of a probabilistic concept of knottedness for an open curve .",
    "in this situation , closure at infinity along all possible directions of prolongation of the chain ends are considered and a probability profile for the detected topological states is considered in place of a single topological identifier  @xcite . in several cases of practical interest",
    "these different schemes yield consistent results .",
    "one notable example of this consensus is provided by knotted proteins which constitute about 1% of the set of presently - known protein structures  @xcite . a very high consistency exists among the different methods of closure regarding the knotted / unknotted state of individual protein chains and also regarding the occurring types of knots  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the cases of minimal ambiguity for the knotted state of an open curve are associated to situations where knots are localised in a small portion of the chain .",
    "indeed a closely - related problem is the determination of the length of a knot ( in either a closed or open chain )  @xcite .",
    "this problem , which has been recently tackled in ref .",
    "@xcite by comparing existing and new closure schemes , will be addressed in section  [ size_knots ] of this review .",
    "in this section we shall introduce a number of standard polymer models whose geometrical and topological properties in a variety of physical conditions will be extensively discussed in the rest of this review . the models will be described in the `` open chain '' formulation as it is understood that the chain closure can be introduced by simply enforcing the coincidence of the first and last monomer of the chain , to obtain polymer rings .    arguably , the simplest discrete polymer model is represented by the _ freely - jointed chain_. the model consists of a succession of equally - long segments , usually termed bonds , that can take any arbitrary relative orientation .",
    "this model essentially captures the chain connectivity property while other salient aspects associated to the energy cost of introducing local bends in the chain , or disallowing self - avoidance , are not considered .",
    "the oversimplified nature of the model brings the advantage of allowing for a straightforward analytical or numerical characterization and is a natural first step for characterizing the behaviour of more realistic polymer models .    , formed by consecutive bonds , as shown in the bottom panel .",
    "( c ) configuration of a discrete chain where the angle of two consecutive bonds is not allowed to exceed 45@xmath101 . ]    to illustrate this point , and for the purposes of introducing the notation that will be used hereafter , we consider a freely - jointed chain configuration , @xmath102 , with nodes at positions @xmath103 . all bonds joining consecutive nodes , @xmath104 , have the same length , @xmath105 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fjc_tc]a .    the mean square end - to - end distance has a linear dependence on the chain length :    @xmath106    where the statistical independence of the orientation of different bonds was used . besides the end - to - end distance , a commonly employed measure of the typical spatial size of the chain",
    "is given by the radius of gyration , @xmath107 : @xmath108    where @xmath109 denotes the location of the chain center of mass , @xmath110 .",
    "in the limit @xmath111 one has that the average end - to - end distance and the radius of gyration are tied by a simple linear relationship , namely @xmath112 which highlights that also @xmath113 depends linearly on @xmath114  @xcite .",
    "as anticipated , the model is highly simplified and needs to be suitably generalised before it can be used to describe key physical aspects of a free polymer in solution . arguably , the simplest physical effect that can be introduced in the model to make contact with the phenomenology of flexible chains is to consider the correlations in the directionality of consecutive bonds .",
    "these correlations arise , for example , when accounting for the polymer bending rigidity . by analogy with the case of an ideal elastic rod",
    "slightly perturbed from the straight configuration , the bending energy of a chain configuration , @xmath102 , can be approximated by the following energy function : @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the chain bending rigidity .",
    "freely - jointed chains endowed with a bending rigidity term as above are termed _ kratky - porod chains_.    because of the simple form of the energy function of eq .",
    "[ eqn : br ] ( which does not account for chain self - avoidance ) , it is possible to compute analytically several properties of kratky - porod chains in thermal equilibrium .",
    "specifically , we shall assume that the statistical weight of a chain configuration , @xmath102 , is given by the canonical boltzmann weight :    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath119 is the temperature and the correct normalization of the statistical weight is ensured by the denominator where the summation stands for the integrated contribution over all possible chain configuration .",
    "the effects that the local bending energy has on the correlation of the bonds directionality in the chain can be ascertained by calculating the average ( equilibrium value ) of the scalar product of two chain bonds at a separation @xmath120 along the chain .",
    "this quantity is straightforwardly calculating starting from @xmath121 and iterating to larger values of @xmath120 obtaining  @xcite :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 denotes the equilibrium average where configurations are weighted with the canonical weight of eq .",
    "[ canonweight ] and the quantity @xmath124 , termed the persistence length , is given by @xmath125.\\ ] ]    the above expression clarifies that the bending rigidity introduces an exponentially decaying correlation in the orientation of bonds along the chain , as readily perceived by the comparative inspection of panels ( a ) and ( c ) in figure  [ fig : fjc_tc ] .",
    "notice that , in the limit @xmath126 , that is when the average value of the bending angle between consecutive bonds is small , the expression of the persistence length simplifies to : @xmath127 , which is the well - known simple relationship tying the persistence length and the bending rigidity in the continuum limit of the krakty - porod chain ( which leads to the so - called _ worm - like chain _ )  @xcite .",
    "a further physical effect that introduces correlations in the bonds orientations is the steric hindrance associated with a finite thickness of the chain .",
    "when accounting for this effect , the model chain should be viewed as the centerline of a discrete thick polymer with cross - sectional radius equal to @xmath128 . at a global level , the finite thickness of the chain introduces correlations in portions of the chain that can be even far apart along the `` polymer sequence '' .",
    "in addition , this self - avoidance has an impact at a local level as the chain can not attain local radii of curvature smaller than @xmath128  @xcite , see figure  [ fig : fjc_tc]b .",
    "this implies that the angle @xmath129 formed by two consecutive bonds must satisfy the following constraint : @xmath130    which , propagated along the chain , introduces an exponentially - decaying correlation of the chain orientation that is entirely analogous to the one in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pers ] ) :    @xmath131^n\\ .\\ ] ]    this correlation , which is readily perceived by the comparative inspection of panels ( a ) and ( c ) in figure  [ fig : fjc_tc ] and the decay length can be viewed as a thickness - related persistence length given by  @xcite :    @xmath132    we stress that the above expression merely captures the _ local _ effects of the finite thickness of the chain .",
    "we conclude this discussion by considering how the interplay of the chain contour length ( that is the total chain length obtained by summing the length of all its bonds ) , @xmath133 , and of the persistence length , @xmath124 , controls the physical behaviour of the system .    to do so we shall consider a kratky - porod model of given contour length , @xmath134 , and given persistence length , @xmath124 . the discretization step , @xmath105 , is assumed to be much smaller than the persistence length ( and therefore @xmath116 is suitably adjusted so to reproduce the given persistence length ) .",

    "it is worth calculating separately the contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ree2 ] ) along the direction approximating the straight rod , @xmath139 and in the plane perpendicular to it , @xmath140 . the first term , @xmath139 , is readily obtained by noting that the average directionality of the chain is biased by the first bond , @xmath141 , so that @xmath142 from expressions ( [ eqn : reepar ] ) and ( [ eqn : ree2 ] ) and using @xmath143 one has , to leading order in @xmath144 and @xmath145 :    @xmath146    when @xmath147 the chain is said to be semi - flexible , in that appreciable deviations from the straight configurations are possible in thermal equilibrium . instead , in the limit @xmath137",
    ", one has @xmath148    by comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ree ] ) , the latter identity can be used to say that the equilibrium size of the chain is equivalent to that of a freely - jointed chain with same contour length , but where the statistically independent segments have effective length equal to twice the persistence length , @xmath149 .",
    "the equivalent length , @xmath150 , is termed the _ kuhn length_.",
    "it is important to stress that in the rigid and semi - flexible regimes the non - local self - avoidance effects in unconstrained chains can be largely neglected , as steric clashes will not be likely to occur because of the limited contour length of the chain .",
    "this is not true when @xmath151 largely exceeds @xmath124 , which is the condition in the flexible polymer regime .",
    "when self - avoidance is taken into account , the end - to - end distance , @xmath152 or , equivalently , the radius of gyration , does not have a linear dependence on the contour length anymore , rather it obeys the more general formula @xmath153    where the self - avoiding exponent @xmath154 is about 0.588  @xcite , and is often approximated by its mean - field estimate 3/5  @xcite ) .",
    "the above discussion has been mostly focused on considerations of the relative magnitude of the persistence and contour length",
    ". for modelling purposes a key element to consider is also the relative magnitude of the polymer thickness , @xmath128 , and the persistence length , @xmath124 .        for several biopolymers , such as polysaccharides , proteins and single - stranded dna ,",
    "the persistence length is comparable with the thickness . in such contexts ,",
    "it is natural to model the polymers as chains of spherical beads of radius @xmath128 , as shown in figure  [ fig : beads_cyls]a .",
    "the so called _ bead model _ can be endowed with a bending rigidity which , together with constraints on the minimum attainable local radius of curvature imposed by the self - avoidance ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : angle ] ) , determines the chain persistence length@xcite .",
    "notice that when the persistence length largely exceeds the chain thickness , then the bonds at a small arclength separation would tend to be collinear .",
    "this observation suggests the possibility of modifying the model so as to reduce the number of effective degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "an effective way to do this is to describe the chain as a sequence of cylinders with thickness @xmath128 and axis length , @xmath120 , equal to a fraction of the persistence length ( and yet much larger than @xmath128 ) .",
    "a possible configuration of a flexible chain of cylinders is shown in figure  [ fig : beads_cyls]b .",
    "again , the correct persistence length would be reproduced by the introduction of a suitable bending rigidity between consecutive cylinders  @xcite .",
    "the excluded volume interaction is simply enforced by disallowing pairs of non - consecutive cylinders from overlapping .",
    "this is done by calculating the distance of minimum approach of the centerlines of the two cylinders and requiring to be larger than @xmath155 , see [ app : segdist ] .",
    "note that the presence of a non - zero thickness , or excluded volume , renders an exact calculation of the tangent - tangent correlations impossible . excluded volume interactions cause the tangent - tangent correlation to acquire appreciable deviations from the exponential decay above a certain arclength separation which depends on the interplay of @xmath120 , @xmath128 and @xmath156 ( for more details see e.g. the comparison between the discretized kratky - porod model which disregards steric effects and molecular dynamics simulations above the @xmath129 point in  @xcite which holds for the bead - and - spring polymer model defined above ) .    the _ cylinder model _",
    "( with flexible joints ) has been largely adopted to model a variety of molecules and especially double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) .",
    "in fact , the dsdna persistence length is equal to 50 nm while the bare dna diameter has the much smaller value of 2.5 nm ( larger effective diameters are reported depending on the concentration / type of counterions in solution  @xcite ) .",
    "a model that interpolates between the beads model and the cylinder model may be described by a sequence of equally - long cylinders of thickness @xmath157 ; at the joints of the cylinders a sphere of radius @xmath158 is introduced , see figure  [ fig : beads_cyls]c . by varying @xmath157 and @xmath158 at fixed cylinder length ,",
    "it is possible to explore the interplay of various excluded volume terms on the conformational statistics of the polymer rings of interest . in the limiting case of unit length cylinders with @xmath159 and @xmath158 finite",
    ", it is obtained the _ rod - bead model _",
    "@xcite which has been often used to study the effect of self - avoidance on the knotting probability of polymer rings ( see section  [ knot_prob ] )    we conclude by observing that , when the polymers are subjected to spatial confinement , one needs to take into account further length - scales in the problem , namely the typical width of the confining geometry . in this case , the viability of cylinder models depends on the possibility of identifying a cylinder length that is not only much larger than @xmath128 , but also appreciably smaller than the width of the confining region .",
    "the above mentioned models allow for a description of polymeric chains through a limited number of continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "albeit greatly simplified , the models are sufficiently complicated that the characterization of their properties ( especially when subject to confinement ) requires the use of advanced stochastic sampling techniques such as those described in the next sections .",
    "occasionally , one deliberately resorts to over - simplified polymer models to achieve an exhaustive enumeration of the configuration space rather than sampling it with stochastic techniques .",
    "almost invariably , these approaches entail the embedding of the model polymer chain on a discrete lattice , for example the cubic lattice .        in the simplest case ,",
    "the polymer is modeled as a walk which joins nearest neighbours on the lattice .",
    "the self - avoidance is introduced by preventing the chain from multiply - occupying any lattice edge or node , as shown in figure  [ fig : lattice ] .",
    "a bending rigidity can also be introduced by giving an energy penalty for non - collinear consecutive segments of the walk .",
    "other variants of this model are possible by allowing the walk to bridge not only nearest neighbours but also , for example , second - nearest neighbours . in this case chains are endowed with a larger configuration freedom though the bond lengths can fluctuate from configuration to configuration @xcite .    denoting by @xmath160",
    "the number of distinct ( up to translation ) self - avoiding walks with @xmath114 segments , hereafter referred to as edges or bonds , on @xmath161 lattice , one can use simple counting arguments to compute by hand the values of @xmath160 for small @xmath114 values : @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 etc . clearly , as @xmath114 increases the manual computation of hand @xmath160 is unfeasible so that it is necessary to resort to efficient numerical techniques for the exhaustive generation , and hence enumeration , of _ all _ possible different walks or rings on a lattice up to a certain number of segments .",
    "these enumeration techniques have been an essential tool to establish and verify several results regarding equilibrium properties of open chains as well as rings . in particular , in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath114 , rigorous results can be established by combinatorial arguments and simple mathematical analysis . among the others we wish to cite here the important theorem due to hammersley  @xcite .",
    "@xmath166    where @xmath167 is the _ limiting entropy _ per step of self - avoiding walks .",
    "@xmath167 depends on the @xmath161 lattice and for the cubic lattice the best estimate is @xmath168  .",
    "the above result establishes that the number of self - avoiding walks increases exponentially rapidly with the number of segments @xmath114 .",
    "few rigorous results are available about the rate of approach to the limit . on the other hand a mapping between the statistics of self - avoiding walks and the @xmath169 model of ferromagnets in the limit @xmath170 ,  @xcite allows us to establish the following scaling behaviour for @xmath160    @xmath171    where @xmath172 is the universal _ entropic exponent _ whose value depends on the dimensionality of the space in which the walk is embedded . for three - dimensions , @xmath173  @xcite . for ring polymers",
    "the corresponding lattice model is a self - avoiding polygon ( or simply polygon ) i.e. a self - avoiding walk with the termini that are one lattice spacing apart . if we denote by @xmath174 the number of ( undirected , unrooted ) self - avoiding polygons embeddable in a lattice , for the simple cubic lattice we have @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "again we count two polygons as distinct if they can not be superimposed by translation . also for polygons",
    "it is possible to prove that  @xcite    @xmath178    notice that unconstrained polygons and self - avoiding walks have the same limiting entropy .",
    "this is a not trivial result since , for example , it does not hold for walks and polygons confined in prisms ( see section  [ rig_prisms ] ) .",
    "in the second part of this review , spanning from sections [ monte_carlo ] to [ knot_prob_stress ] , we summarize the state - of - the - art of the characterization of the types and abundance of knots formed by polymers which circularize either in unrestricted environments or under spatial confinement .    the interest in characterizing the probability that polymers , fluctuating in equilibrium , form a knot upon circularization has grown in parallel with the availability of experimental techniques capable of detecting the knotted / unknotted state of circular polymers .",
    "common experience suggests that long ropes that are shaken or shuffled , tend to become highly self - entangled .",
    "when their ends are joined , the chances that the resulting arc loop is knotted are quite high , just think of your garden hose or extension cord after it has been repeatedly used and stored away , see figure  [ fig : extension_cord ] .",
    "knot , see panel b. in our experience the knot complexity in the extension cord increases as it is repeatedly used and stored away ( that is before our spouses force us to get up from the couch and engage the endless battle against the cable configuration entropy ! ) . ]",
    "this observation leads to the question : what is the degree of knotting of flexible polymers fluctuating in thermal equilibrium ?",
    "a first answer to this was already proposed in the early sixties by frisch , wasserman  @xcite and delbruck  @xcite ( fwd ) who conjectured that infinitely - long rings are almost certainly knotted ( their knotting probability tends to 1 when their length goes to infinity ) .",
    "about twenty years later this conjecture was turned into a rigorous theorem for different models of polymer rings  .",
    "the key concepts underpinning the proof are given in section  [ knot_prob ] .    since the fwd conjecture",
    "several efforts have been spent on the precise characterization of how the knotting probability depends on the length of the ring polymer .",
    "more recently , the interest has shifted towards characterizing how the knot spectrum ( that is the knot type and relative abundance / frequency ) depends on the polymer length .",
    "most of these investigations have been carried out by numerical means .",
    "the computational cost of such studies is significant and arises from two separate factors . on one hand",
    ", the sampling of a statistically - significant ensemble of independent polymer ring configurations can be very demanding , especially for confined rings .",
    "on the other hand , the precise assignment of the knotted state of each sampled configuration can be computationally intensive too as it entails the combinatorial calculation of global topological invariants , which rapidly grows as a function of the ring length ( or degree of confinement ) .",
    "both these challenges are discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "particular attention is paid to the description of efficient stochastic techniques which have proved to be useful in sampling polymer ring conformations in a variety of physical situations ( see section  [ monte_carlo ] ) .",
    "specifically , we first discuss and illustrate the efficient sampling of unconstrained , flexible and self - avoiding ring polymers .",
    "these results are used to illustrate the viability of simplified polymers models in reproducing the experimental knot spectrum , found via gel electrophoresis techniques , for specific biomolecules , particularly dna  @xcite .",
    "next , attention is turned to the case of polymer rings subject to a variety of external physical constrains . on one hand",
    ", this problem is motivated by the advent of novel experiments based on micro- and nano - fluidic devices , or on micromanipulation tools such as afm  @xcite and optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "these techniques allow an unprecedented quantitative characterization of the detailed behaviour of long polymers in confined conditions  @xcite .",
    "this may be achieved by inserting these molecules in narrow channels  @xcite , by adsorbing them onto smooth surfaces  @xcite , or by subjecting them to tensile stress  @xcite .",
    "a detailed understanding of the statical and dynamical properties of macromolecules in confined environment is crucial also for designing novel applicative avenues for nano - confinement , such as the use of nanochannels to pre - stretch and stabilize dna molecules prior to their threading through a nanopore  @xcite or to make a binding site along a long coiled dna molecule accessible to external probes  @xcite . on the other hand , as noted previously , genomic materials are also subject to spatial confinement _ in vivo _ , and their entanglement properties are crucial to the correct functioning of dna replication , transcription etc .",
    "the interest in polymer and knot adsorption is also motivated by the fact that this is rather easy to realise in the lab .",
    "for instance , when a polymer is rooted at the surface , by modulating ( e.g. by means of temperature ) the effective attractive potential between the polymer and the surface , it is possible to trigger an adsorption transition from an extended regime ( with high configuration entropy ) to an adsorbed one when it is mostly localised in proximity of the surface  @xcite",
    ". this phenomenon may provide a way to visualise the impact of quasi-2d confinement on topology . for a polymer embedded exactly in a 2d plane or a sphere",
    "it is impossible to form knots  how is this regime reached in practice as a function of temperature ?",
    "this question may now be answered experimentally .",
    "the interest in the behaviour under stretching is further sparked by the recent use of modern micromanipulation techniques   to characterize the mechanical response of entangled polymers  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is nowadays possible even to tie a knot in a piece of dna or actin fiber  @xcite and then monitor its reptation dynamics along the stretched filament  @xcite .",
    "the experimental difficulties in establishing the knotting probability for ring polymers subject to geometrical / spatial constraints is paralleled by the challenges found in theoretical characterizations of analogous properties for simplified models .",
    "the difficulty arises from the competition of several length scales , e.g. the polymer contour length , the size of the confining geometry , and the polymer persistence length ( a measure of its flexibility ) .",
    "we shall present the key theoretical concepts that have been introduced to tackle this problem such as the de gennes blob picture and the odijk deflection theory  @xcite which are valid , respectively , for weak and strong confinement .",
    "we shall also report on the state - of - the - art computational techniques used to reduce the impact on the sampling efficiency of the long relaxation times in dense polymer phases . finally , for lattice models",
    ", it is possible to extend some of the rigorous results found in the unconstrained situation to the confined case ",
    "these results are reviewed in section  [ rigorous_confined ] .",

    "we here address the following key questions :    * how does the knotting probability depend on the degree and the geometry of the confinement ?",
    "* does the crossover between the de gennes and the odijik regimes correspond to a significant change in the knotting probability ? * what is the knot spectrum of linear polymers that circularize under spatial confinement ?    as a biological application , we will review the studies of the topological entanglement of viral dna inside viral bacteriophage capsids@xcite .",
    "this is an extremely intriguing problem for a number of reasons .",
    "for instance , until very recently , it was not possible to account theoretically for the experimentally - observed viral knot spectrum using simplified dna models . furthermore , one may ask how it is possible that bacteriophages are still infective and can eject their dna into their bacterial host , given the high level of entanglement of the dna inside the capsid . as we shall see , computer simulations helped shed light on both these issues .    finally , the three - dimensional confinement is complemented by the discussion of the adsorption of polymer rings onto a two - dimensional surface , and the behaviour of knots upon mechanical stretching  @xcite .    in section  [ knot_prob_ads ]",
    "we discuss the adsorption of polymer rings onto a two - dimensional surface , and discuss the following issues :    * how does the knotting probability depend on the degree of adsorption ? * how are the universal properties of polymer adsorption affected by topology ?",
    "* the critical point governing the adsorption transition of linear polymers has been well characterised  .",
    "is this critical point governing also a topological transition separating a regime of high knotting probability from one in which knot formation is negligible ? * what do we know about the knot spectrum of adsorbed polymers ?    we close this section with a list of unsolved open problems .",
    "it is particularly long because there have been very few investigations on the topic to date .",
    "finally , in section  [ knot_prob_stress ] we survey the few results which have been obtained on the knotting probability and entanglement complexity of polymer chains under stress at equilibrium .",
    "most of them refer to lattice models and are based on combinatorial arguments valid in the thermodynamic limit and on numerical simulations .",
    "the analytic characterization of the behaviour of polymers subject to geometrical or topological constraints is a challenging task even for the simplest polymer models , such as freely - jointed chains  @xcite .",
    "essential tools for making progress in such characterizations are stochastic computational techniques such as monte carlo approaches .    in the present context ,",
    "a monte carlo scheme consists of a set of rules for the stochastic generation of a succession of polymer configurations so that the steady state probability of visiting any given conformation is given by its canonical weight .    in brief",
    ", the scheme can be formulated as follows .",
    "we denote by @xmath179 the polymer configuration at a given monte carlo step , and by @xmath180 its energy . at the next step",
    "a new polymer configuration @xmath181 ( with energy @xmath182 ) is selected with uniform probability in the polymer configuration space .",
    "a stochastic criterion is next used to decide whether , at the next monte carlo step , the system configuration is given by @xmath181 or if the `` old '' one , @xmath179 , must be retained .",

    "because at each monte carlo step , the probability of accepting the trial configuration depends only on the configuration at the previous step ( and not on `` older '' ones ) , the mc evolution realizes a markov chain     starting from an initial conformation , the repeated application of the acceptance / rejection scheme ensures that in the long run , polymer configurations @xmath197 are picked with probability proportional to their canonical weight , @xmath198  .    in contexts of practical interest ,",
    "the implementation of the monte carlo algorithm differs from the above general formulation in that the new conformation , @xmath181 is not picked randomly from the conformational ensemble but is generated from @xmath179 by applying some stochastic structural changes to it .",
    "the choice of the set of stochastic deformations , commonly termed `` moves '' , severely impacts the performance of the monte carlo sampling .",
    "first , the moves must be compatible with the ergodicity requirement . by this",
    "it is meant that any two possible conformations might be connected by a finite number of deformation steps . if this is so , then clearly the succession of generated states viewed with a sufficiently large ( but finite ) time stride is equivalent to the most general formulation where any configuration can be proposed at each monte carlo step .",
    "in addition , the moves can strongly affect the autocorrelation time of the system .",
    "for a similar computational investment , two sets of moves can , in fact , be associated with very different breadths of visited phase space and hence number of statistically - independent configurations .        customarily , the set of polymer moves usually consists of a combination of local and global deformations .",
    "local deformations are those in which only a small number of consecutive monomers are displaced from their current positions . in polymer models where the chain length is not preserved ( that is where the chain connectivity is enforced by a suitable potential  @xcite ) , the local moves are simply accomplished by displacing the monomers randomly within a cube or sphere of preassigned size and centered in the current position . in polymer models where the chain length is preserved ( as in the freely - jointed or kratky - porod chain ) the _ local _",
    "displacement is obtained through a crankshaft move as illustrated ( in a cubic lattice context  ) in figure  [ fig : mcmoves]a .",
    "these local deformations are associated with changes of the polymer self - energy that are sufficiently small that the deformed structures are accepted with good probability ( say , about 50% ) .",
    "this does not necessarily imply a high efficiency of the scheme .",
    "in fact , the long time required before the cumulated local deformations can globally alter the structure , is reflected in large autocorrelation times that scale proportionally to @xmath199 ( @xmath114 being the polymer length )  @xcite .",
    "the latter can be significantly reduced by introducing global moves where a sizeable fraction of the polymer chain is moved . in an open chain , a global deformation",
    "is obtained by a pivot move .",
    "the latter consists of picking randomly a polymer bead and a random unit vector through it ( see appendix in  @xcite for a discussion of how to uniformly pick unit vectors in three - dimensions ) .",
    "the chain portion following ( or equivalently preceding ) the picked bead is next displaced by rotation through a random angle around the unit vector . in closed chains ( rings ) the global move is instead realized by operating a crankshaft move around an axis passing trough two randomly - picked points of the chain . by analogy with the open chain case this move",
    "is also termed `` two - point pivot '' move .",
    "similar procedures are performed also for lattice polymer models ; the main difference here is that the rotations in @xmath200 are replaced by symmetry operations of the underlying lattice  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : mcmoves]b .",
    "global moves are obviously more computationally demanding than local ones and the associated changes in polymer self - energy are usually large and unfavourable@xcite .",
    "as intuitively expected , they in fact , often lead to violations of self - avoidance . despite the fact that their acceptance probability is small",
    "the extent of their associated structural changes is so large that they can dramatically reduce the system autocorrelation time @xmath8  @xcite . in particular , denoting by @xmath201 the acceptance fraction of pivot moves , it is possible to show that @xmath202 where @xmath203 in @xmath204  @xcite . on the other hand after a time of order @xmath205 the global conformation of the polymer should have reached an  essentially \" new state .",
    "consequently the autocorrelation function of global properties of the configuration , such as mean - squared radius of gyration , span along @xmath51 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 directions , should have a decay time ( autocorrelation time ) of the order @xmath205 .",
    "local observables typically evolve a factor @xmath114 more slowly than global one , i.e. with @xmath208 ; topological properties , however , are expected to be more slowly relaxing than global geometric properties .",
    "a vivid illustration of this latter aspect in the contexts of open polymers undergoing a colapse transition is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "besides the above - mentioned local and global moves , a further type of move , termed reptation , is adopted for polymer melts or confined polymers .",
    "the use of this move is suggested by the observation that the severe excluded volume constraints arising in dense polymer phases , force each chain to move by slithering through the surrounding polymer network  @xcite .",
    "algorithmically , the reptation move consists of deleting the end bond from one of two chain extremities and adding it , with a random orientation , to the other . the autocorrelation time associated to this type of move scales like @xmath209 .",
    "the combination of the above mentioned local and global moves is , in general , not sufficient to adequately sample the relevant conformational space of polymers in dense solutions or in confined geometries . in these situations , which are the main object of the present review ,",
    "even local moves are likely to incur in a high ejection rate as a consequence of the high polymer density",
    ".    for a given computational investment the breadth of visited conformational space can be enhanced by a generalised sampling scheme where several monte carlo evolutions are run in parallel . in this scheme , equivalently referred to as parallel tempering or more aptly as multiple markov chains , each monte carlo evolution is associated to a different thermodynamic parameter which , for simplicity we shall here take as an effective temperature  @xcite . in contexts of polymer confinement the parameter is more suitably chosen to be a confining isotropic pressure .",
    "we shall also assume that the copies are labelled and indexed so that the temperature systematically increases from the first copy to the last .",
    "each copy of the system is evolved independently under a standard monte carlo evolution for a preassigned number of steps .",
    "after this , two neighbouring ( in the sense of consecutive indexing ) system copies , are picked .",
    "we shall indicate with @xmath180 [ @xmath182 ] and @xmath211 [ @xmath212 the energy and inverse temperature of the copy @xmath187 [ @xmath186 ] .",
    "a swap of the configurations between the two copies is proposed .",
    "after the swap the energy of copy @xmath187 , which is kept at temperature @xmath214 , would be @xmath182 while the energy of copy @xmath186 would be @xmath180 . the canonical weight of the system corresponding jointly to copies a _ and _ b is @xmath215 before the swap while it would be equal to @xmath216 after the swap . by considering the ratio of these two canonical weights it is possible to generalize the metropolis criterion so to ensure that the proposed swap is accepted / rejected respecting the combination of canonical weights .",
    "by analogy with the single monte carlo evolution this condition is ensured if the swap is accepted with probability given by @xmath217 .    by adopting this generalised monte carlo scheme the exploration of phase space",
    "is greatly aided by the fact that different conformations are passed between copies of the system kept at different thermodynamic conditions  @xcite .",
    "note that , although the lag time separating the swap can be chosen arbitrarily , the procedure becomes inefficient compared to the single monte carlo evolution if the lag time is set to be longer than the autocorrelation time of the individual monte carlo copies .",
    "it is important to observe that the scheme described above does not necessarily need be performed by assigning different temperatures to the various copies of the system .",
    "it is very often convenient to generalize the canonical weight of a configuration by introducing suitable conjugate variables in addition to energy and temperature .    in the specific context of confined polymers ,",
    "one such choice is offered by volume and confining pressure , as discussed hereafter .",
    "the simplest way by which one can generate an ensemble of conformations under spatial confinement is to introduce a significant energy penalty for configurations that do not respect the spatial constraint .",
    "if , for example , one wishes to study a chain confined in a spherical region one could add to the polymer potential energy a very large energy penalty for each of its beads or segments protruding from the spherical boundary .",
    "as explained later in section [ rigorous_confined ] , when the system density is large , most of the monte carlo moves applied to a configuration that correctly lies within the allowed spherical region will likely cross the sphere boundary and hence be rejected .",
    "the monte carlo evolution under the spatial constraint will therefore be very inefficient .",
    "a practical solution to this problem is to substitute the constraint of the `` hard '' boundary with a `` soft '' one resulting , for example , from the application of an isotropic confining pressure @xmath218 . accordingly , to the potential energy of a polymer configuration is added the quantity @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the volume of the smallest sphere that enclosed the configuration .",
    "the multiple markov chain scheme can then be run with polymer copies kept at the same system temperature , but at different confining pressures . in this scheme , for a given computational investment , we will generate many more independent configurations with very different degree of confinement .",
    "each of the system copies corresponds , in fact , to a constant - pressure ensemble and not to a constant - volume one as in the previously - described scheme .",
    "the data collected in the multiple - markov chains evolving at different pressures can nevertheless be suitably processed to recover the equilibrium behaviour of the constant - volume ensemble .",
    "this method is known as thermodynamic reweighting   and its principal aim is to optimally combine the data of the various markov chains so to compute the density of states as a function of the relevant physical variable(s ) .    for the case considered here",
    "the key variable is the confining volume , @xmath220 .",
    "let us focus on the set of independent configurations sampled by @xmath56 markov chain kept at pressure @xmath221 .",
    "the histogram of how many configurations have been sampled for various finely - discretized values , @xmath222 of the confining volume is computed .",
    "we shall indicate with @xmath223 the number of hits in the @xmath54th volume binning interval .",
    "when the total number of sampled configurations in the @xmath56 markov chain is @xmath224 , the _ expected _ value of @xmath223 is : @xmath225    where @xmath226 is the desired weighted density of states of the system which accounts not only for the large number of configurations with volume @xmath227 , but also for their canonical weight .",
    "the density of states , @xmath226 can therefore be recovered , up to a multiplicative constant ( which can be fixed by a suitable normalization procedure ) by inversion of the above relationship . in principle , an infinitely - large number of configurations sampled at a given pressure could be used to recover the density of states @xmath226 over the full range of allowed values of the enclosing volume . in practice , in a finite simulation , most of the configurations will cover a limited interval of volume values .",
    "the data collected in the various markov chains running at different pressures will cover different volume ranges .",
    "if the ranges overlap appreciably , the information can be combined into single determination of @xmath226 .",
    "the optimal combination can be made using criteria which minimize the statistical uncertainty on the @xmath228 profile  .",
    "the method presented above can be generalised so that it is possible to obtain the system density of states as a function of more than one parameter . in particular , for the purpose of discussing how spatial confinement",
    "affects the degree of knotting of polymers that circularise in equilibrium it becomes necessary to recover the density of states as a function of both the confining volume @xmath220 and the knot type @xmath8 : @xmath229 . by doing so",
    ", the data collected in the various markov chains can be used to estimate the probability of occurrence of various knot types as a function of confinement .",
    "finally we mention that , while the example considered here pertains to an isotropic three - dimensional confinement , it can be straightforwardly applied also when the chain is confined in , say , a slab of width @xmath230 . in this cases , in place of the isotropic confining pressure , @xmath218 , conjugate to the configuration volume , @xmath220",
    ", one introduces an anisotropic pressure which conjugates with the calliper size of the configuration measured in the direction perpendicular to the slab planes ( see section  [ knot_prob_conf ] ) .",
    "one of the challenges that are faced when sampling spatially - confined polymer rings , is that the configurations have a very high degree of geometrical entanglement .",
    "for example , configurations of freely - jointed rings of 100 segments confined in a sphere of radius equal to 3 times the segment length produce planar projections with about 150 crossings .",
    "the high degree of entanglement poses several difficulties .",
    "for example , the calculation of alexander determinants for these projections is prone to round - off errors .",
    "in addition , if , say , an unknotted configuration is associated to a badly - entangled projection with hundreds of crossings , then even if its determinant is correctly calculated , it will not be generally possible to assign unambiguously its knotted state due to the fact that , e.g. the same alexander determinants may be shared by many knots with less crossings than in the reference projection .",
    "these difficulties can be greatly reduced by subjecting the generated configurations and their diagrammatic projections to topology - preserving simplification procedures . to illustrate this point",
    "suppose that the diagram of a certain closed curve has 11 crossings and that its ( irreducible ) alexander polynomial is equal to the one of the unknot .",
    "the knot identity can not be established on the basis of these informations alone because it could correspond either to the unknot or to the conway or kinoshita - terasaka knot ( see section [ subsec : polynomials ] ) , which has minimal crossing number equal to 11 . however ,",
    "if by a sequence of reidemeister moves the diagram was simplified to the point that it consists of 10 or less crossings , then the previous ambiguity would be resolved in favour of the unknot .    for off - lattice chains ,",
    "the topology - preserving simplification algorithms involve the displacement , deletion and insertions of nodes in the ring so to ultimately make the latter as smooth as possible and with as few bonds as possible . in its simplest formulation ,",
    "the method consists of repeated attempted `` rectifications '' of the chain . at each rectification step , a chain bead is chosen at random and is tentatively displaced so to make it more collinear with its flanking beads . the new bead position is accepted only if no bond crossing occurs during the continuous chain deformation obtained by bridging the previous bead position with the tentative one .",
    "otherwise , the previous position is retained , see [ app : topopres ] for details .",
    "whenever a bead can be made exactly collinear with its flanking ones , then the bead can be eliminated from the chain , so that the flanking ones become joined by a single chain bond .",
    "the repeated application of these moves typically results in dramatic simplifications of the projected diagram .",
    "notice , however , that in general , this `` greedy '' approach can not be expected to reach the minimally - complex diagram ; in fact , it is known that the geometrical complexity of particular tangles needs to be increased first , before allowing for a full simplification of the configuration .",
    "the above algorithm is explicitly formulated for off - lattice chains and does not lead naturally to an algorithm for chains embedded in a lattice , for which other types of topology - preserving geometrical simplifications have been introduced  @xcite . for self - avoiding polygons on a cubic lattice",
    "a very effective scheme is provided by the so - called bfacf algorithm , an acronym with the initials of the people who first introduced it to sample walks with fixed extremities  .",
    "the standard bfacf can be defined as follows : ( i ) pick an edge of the current polygon ( say @xmath231 ) at random with uniform probability .",
    "( ii ) pick a unit vector @xmath232 perpendicular to that edge ( iii ) move the chosen edge one lattice space along @xmath232 and insert two more edges at its endpoints to keep the polygon connected .",
    "( iv ) erase any double edges ( spikes ) that may result from this operation .",
    "it is easy to see that this procedure will result in one of the three moves illustrated in figure  [ fig : bfacf ] with possible changes in the length of the polygon @xmath233 or @xmath234 . if the new configuration , @xmath235 , does not violate the self - avoidance constraints ( i.e. no steric clashes of chain beads ) it then accepted with probability proportional to a weight @xmath236 where @xmath237 if @xmath238 and @xmath239 if @xmath240 .",
    "the parameter @xmath241 is called _ bond fugacity _ and it is used to control the average length of the sampled polygons : for @xmath241 approaching a critical value @xmath116 the average length of the sampled polygons diverges while for @xmath242 the algorithm tends to sample polygons with the shortest length allowed .",
    "it is easy to check that this implementation of the bfacf algorithm is reversible .",
    "moreover , since neither bfacf move allows crossings of polygon bonds the succession of bfacf moves manifestly preserves the knot type of the original chain .    a more delicate question is whether by repeatedly applying bfacf moves to an initial configuration one can _ in principle _ generate all the possible polygon configurations with a certain knot type and polygon length .",
    "the question is equivalent to asking whether the ergodic classes of the markov chain coincide with the knot types .",
    "a positive answer to this question was given in   using an argument based on reidemeister moves .",
    "since the bfacf is ergodic within each knot class it has been often used to investigate equilibrium properties of polygons with fixed knot type ( see section [ fixed_knot ] ) . moreover ,",
    "if the bond fugacity @xmath241 is slowly decreased ( annealing procedure ) the algorithm would bring ( in principle ) any given configuration to a minimal length that is compatible with its knot type .",
    "this would drastically reduce the number of crossings in the corresponding diagram allowing a sufficiently precise knot detection also for geometrically - intricate embeddings @xcite .    when the structure can not be further simplified geometrically it is still possible to manipulate the resulting projection removing further non - essential crossings .",
    "one practical way to do this is to associate the knot diagram with its dowker code which essentially follows the numbered succession of over and underpasses in the projection .",
    "reidemeister moves can be performed very easily on the dowker code by algebraically manipulating it  @xcite .",
    "inspection of the dowker code can further reveal the factorisability of a knot .",
    "after these simplifications , it could be the case that the simplified dowker code of a diagram ( or one of its factors ) matches the tabulated dowker code of a prime knot ( there exist look - up tables of such codes for knots of up to 16 crossings ) .",
    "in such situations the knot identification is exact . in other cases",
    "such positive identification can not be achieved .",
    "this might reflect either the fact that the knot is genuinely a very complicated one or that it has not be simplified sufficiently to allow for its identification .",
    "a fundamental question regarding the knottedness of discretised closed curves ( polymer rings ) in equilibrium is _ what is the knotting probability as a function of the ring length ?",
    "_    systematic attempts to address this issue date back to the early 1960s when frisch , wasserman  @xcite and delbruck  @xcite conjectured that _ sufficiently long ring polymers would be knotted with probability one_. while the statement appears intuitive , it was not until 1988 that the validity of the frisch - wasserman - delbruck ( fwd ) conjecture was proved true for self - avoiding polygons embedded in the cubic lattice  .",
    "the difficulty of establishing the result rigorously is due to the fact that knottedness , being a topological attribute , is a global property of the chain and can not be described in terms of local chain features which are much simpler to characterize and control .",
    "here we give a qualitative argument of the proof ( see   or section [ knot_prob_conf ] for more details ) which is based on the ingenious idea of considering particular knot realizations having a localised geometrical representation .",
    "in particular , considerations are restricted to `` tight knots '' .",
    "a tight knot is the mathematical version of tying a knot in a piece of string , and pulling it as tight as possible . for a self - avoiding walk on the simple cubic lattice ,",
    "each occupied vertex generates an excluded volume for itself , the dual 3-cell of the vertex .",
    "the key observation is that the tight knot occupies a compact region of space ( @xmath243-ball ) which , owing to the self - avoiding constraint , is inaccessible to the remainder of the chain .",
    "consequently , one has that a tight knot tied with a small stretch of the chain can not be `` undone '' by the remainder of the chain . because anti - knots do not exist , it is clear that if the _ local _ inspection of the chain reveals the presence of a tight knot then the chain is necessarily knotted .",
    "accordingly , the fwd conjecture would be proven if at least one tight knot is contained in sufficiently long rings .",
    "the latter statement is proved resorting to the kesten s pattern theorem  @xcite for self - avoiding walks where the chosen pattern is the union of the curve portion taking part to the tight knot and the 3-ball .",
    "based on the pattern theorem , and denoting by @xmath244 the probability that an equilateral polygon with @xmath114 bonds , or @xmath114-gon , is knotted , one has that the number of unknotted polygons decreases exponentially fast for large values of @xmath114 :    @xmath245    where @xmath246 is a strictly positive quantity .",
    "the relationship in eq .",
    "( [ knot_prob_free_eq1 ] ) therefore proves the fwd conjecture for polygons in the cubic lattice .",
    "similar results have been obtained for off - lattice polygons with infinitely - thin bonds , such as gaussian polygons  @xcite and equilateral random polygons i.e. freely - jointed rings  @xcite . despite the fact that these non - self - avoiding polygons may thread several times through a knotted region , it is still possible to prove that tight local knots occur with high probability and that the topological @xmath243-ball surrounding such knots is threaded through by the rest of the polygon with a vanishing probability . in this case",
    "the fwd conjecture is proven in the form @xmath247 where @xmath187 and @xmath248 are strictly positive constants .",
    "extensions of these rigorous results to the case of off - lattice models with finite thickness are not available yet .    from the above account",
    ", it is clear that the arguments employed to prove the fwd conjecture are based on polygons with an arbitrarily large number of bonds , @xmath114 . to present day , in fact , there are no exact ( analytic ) results for the probability of occurrence of knots in rings of a given finite length",
    ".    the latter question has been consequently addresses by numerical techniques such as exact enumeration or stochastic sampling methods . in particular ,",
    "monte carlo approaches such as the ones described in section  [ monte_carlo ] , are commonly used to sample the equilibrium conformations of a ring with @xmath114 bonds whose topology is , in turn , established by the knot identification routines described in section  [ knot_theory ] .",
    "the knotting probability is next computed as a function of @xmath114 and the value of @xmath246 is obtained from a best - fit procedure with the functional form given by eq .  [ knot_prob_free_eq1 ] .",
    "one of the earliest numerical attempts to characterise the knotting probability was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of polygons embedded on the body - centered cubic lattice .",
    "it was established that , although infinitely - long lattice polygons are certainly knotted , the constant @xmath246 in eq .",
    "( [ knot_prob_free_eq1 ] ) is typically so small that the occurrence of knots becomes detectable only for polygons with several hundred bonds .",
    "the first attempt to estimate @xmath246 was done in   where a two - point pivot algorithm was used to generate polygons of up to @xmath249 bonds on the face - centered - cubic lattice .",
    "the study of their knotting probability ( based on the non - triviality of the alexander polynomial ) lead to estimate that @xmath246 was equal to @xmath250 .",
    "interestingly , even at the largest chain lengths , @xmath249 , almost all the knots found were of the simplest type , namely trefoils .",
    "an analogous calculation was later carried out for polygons with up to @xmath251 edges on the simple cubic lattice  @xcite . by using derivatives of the jones polynomial to detect knotting",
    ", it was established that @xmath252 .",
    "both these findings were later confirmed by detailed and extensive simulations for polygons of up to @xmath253 edges on the simple cubic ( sc ) , face centred cubic ( fcc ) and body centred cubic ( bcc ) lattices  @xcite . it was shown that , @xmath254 ( sc ) , @xmath255 ( fcc ) and @xmath256 ( bcc ) .",
    "note that these estimates indicate that @xmath246 is lattice dependent .",
    "if one interprets @xmath246 as the inverse of the characteristic polymer length , @xmath257 , required to have an appreciable fraction of knotted rings it turns out that , for each of these lattices , the value of @xmath257 is a little larger than @xmath258 .",
    "this large value of @xmath257 is reflected in the computational difficulty of collecting a statistically - significant ensemble of knotted polygons through a simple stochastic sampling of the configuration space of ( long ) polygons .",
    "if one is interested in characterizing the properties of knotted polygons with a given topology then other sampling strategies may prove much more efficient .",
    "for example , for polygons on the cubic lattice one could resort to the topology - preserving bfacf moves described in section  [ knot_simp ] .    the knotting probability has been also investigated numerically for off - lattice models of rings such as the rod - bead model and the cylinder models described in section  [ cylinder_models ] .    for the rod - bead model",
    "the probability of being unknotted is still well represented by ( [ knot_prob_free_eq1 ] ) but with @xmath246 increasing as the radius @xmath259 of the beads decreases , ranging from @xmath260 for @xmath261   down to @xmath262 for @xmath263  , which is rather similar to the value found for the lattice calculation .",

    "interestingly , the study also showed that the characteristic length @xmath257 increases with radius of the cylinders which make up the ring ; the dependence is approximately exponential for small cylinder radii . as expected , thinner rings of cylinders have a larger knotting probability at fixed number of cylinders .",

    "@xcite specifically addressed the knotting probability of a semi - flexible thick chain subject to a progressive spatial confinement .",

    "the understanding of the genome organization across eukaryotic , bacterial and viral organisms is far from being complete .",
    "arguably , one of the best characterised systems is represented by the smallest types of organisms , namely bacteriophages .",
    "the latter , in fact , have been probed in recent years by the most advanced experimental techniques .",
    "this has provided a wealth of information about the detailed structure of the capsids and , to a more limited extent , of the organization of the genome held inside .",
    "prototypical examples are provided by bacteriophages such as @xmath437 , which have been resolved by means of cryo - em techniques .",
    "these experiments , which did not enforce any _ a priori _ symmetry on the resolved structure , have revealed a highly ordered organization of the dna contained in the capsid interior . in particular , the genome arrangement was compatible with that of an inverse spool with a progressive increase of disorder moving towards the interior of the capsid .",
    "the degree of order of the packaged dna is affected by specific details of the capsid and of the surrounding solvent .",
    "computer models of packaged dna have shown , for example that the presence of an inner core inside the capsid favours the increase of dna order  @xcite .",
    "the degree of oblateness or prolateness of the ellipsoid approximating the capsid , is also known to influence the specific dna arrangement  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of counterions in solution , which can diffuse through the capsid walls can affect the dna self - repulsion and hence produce different arrangements  @xcite .",
    "upon considering the high degree of order observed in several experimental measurements one might expect a low incidence of knots in the packaged dna .",
    "model arrangement of well - ordered inverse spools show , in fact , the virtual absence of knots after circularization  @xcite .",
    "the necessity to avoid knots inside capsids might , at first sight , also appear to be a biological necessity as the viral genome needs to be ejected through a narrow channel ( the virus tail ) into the infected bacterial cell and knots in the genome could obstruct the exit channel thus preventing the infection  @xcite .",
    "these two observations are challenged by a series of measurements carried out on tailless mutants of the p4 virus . in these mutants ,",
    "the two complementary ends of dna can anneal inside the capsid ( in wild - type viruses one end would be anchored to the tail ) producing a circular dna molecule .",
    "the knotted state of the latter , which does not change unless the molecule is broken , is revealed through gel electrophoresis  @xcite .",
    "the experiments have revealed a very high fraction ( 95% ) of knotted molecules , unlike what was predicted on the basis of ordered spool models of packaged dna .",
    "it is important to remark that a smaller , but still large percentage of knotted dna molecules was observed in wild - type p4 genome where circularisation occurs after the destruction of the capsid .",
    "the knotted dna molecules therefore reflect a fairly high degree of entanglement already present inside the capsid .",
    "we remark here that this aspect is not necessarily in contradiction with the fact that dna needs to be delivered efficiently through the phage head .",
    "indeed , it is known that knots occurring in ( unconstrained ) chains tend not to be localised  @xcite , and a highly delocalised knot may be fully compatible with the genome exiting from the tail without occurrence of obstructions .    before discussing the details of the knot spectrum of p4 dna molecules we shall first attempt to relate the findings with the results discussed in the previous section about knots in confined rings .",

    "@xcite , the @xmath25kb - long circularised p4 genome ( corresponding to a contour length of @xmath438 m ) was modeled as a flexibible ring of @xmath439 cylinders . the cross - sectional diameter , or thickness , of the cylinders",
    "was set to 2.5 nm which corresponds to the diameter of hydrated double - stranded dna . between consecutive cylinders a bending rigidity",
    "was introduced appropriate to reproduce , within kratky - porod models , the nominal dsdna persistence length of 50 nm .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the model were studied with an advanced sampling technique analogous to those described in the methods sections ( particularly multiple - markov chains at various confining pressures and reweighting techniques )  @xcite .    in accord with what was established for the confined freely - jointed rings ,",
    "also for the thick flexible ring of cylinders it was seen that , for increasing spatial confinement , the knot spectrum is shifted towards higher complexity with a similar progression of complexity . in particular , it was seen ( again consistent with the freely - jointed rings case ) , that among the knots with five minimal crossings , the torus knot @xmath6 is systematically about half as probable than knot @xmath7 over a wide range of @xmath425 values , see figure  [ fig:5152 ] .     and @xmath7 in flexible rings of cylinders of @xmath439 bonds ( of unit length ) confined in a sphere of radius @xmath284 .",
    "the bending rigidity of the rings and the thickness of the cylinders has been set to match those of circular dna molecules of the p4 bacteriophage ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details )",

    "figure adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "this aspect appears profoundly different from what was established experimentally for the knotting of the p4 genome .",
    "a series of experiments , in fact , have shown that , among the simplest types of knots , torus knots are much more abundant than twist ones . in particular , the knot of type @xmath6 was present in much higher abundance than @xmath7 , which , in fact , was virtually absent from the measured spectrum .",
    "the bias in favour of torus knots is accompanied by another apparent bias , namely the one in favour of chiral knots .",
    "it is seen , in particular that knot @xmath16 appears much less frequently than simpler or more complex knot types ( e.g. @xmath86 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "this result then leads to the question of whether the knot spectrum of dna phage might at all be explained via a model of confined polymers in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "one possibility is that the phage knot `` selection '' is a consequence of a certain degree of ordered spooling in the dna conformations , which , while not large enough to drive the formation of a perfect unknotted spool , may still provide a measurable bias towards chiral and torus knots .",
    "for instance , arsuaga and diao recently showed that fluctuating , hence imperfect , dna spools generate a knot spectrum closer to the experimental one  .",
    "however the generation of dna spools came from a mathematical algorithm rather than a force field or potential , so it remained unclear what physical mechanism , kinetic or thermodynamic , provides the ultimate driver for the bias towards torus and chiral knots .",
    "these biases are indirect clues about how dna is organised inside the capsid ; in particular they are suggestive of certain degree of ordered spooling , as this would be intuitively accompanied by a bias in chiral and torus knots .",
    "the discrepancy of experiments and computational predictions based on the simplified dna models poses the interesting question of what specific aspects of dna self - interaction and/or the genome packaging process need to be accounted for in order to explain the observed measurements .    in a very recent contribution , we provided quantitative evidence supporting the scenario that the biases in the knot spectrum may be explained via a more accurate force field which takes into account dna self - interactions in a more realistic way  @xcite . the main novelty in ref .",
    "@xcite is the introduction of a chiral potential which favours a small twist angle between spatially contacting dna segments .",
    "this potential would promote a cholesteric apolar ordering of dna ( with a pitch is in the @xmath440 m range , hence much larger than the phage size ) .",
    "such a chiral ordering _ is _ commonly observed in sufficiently concentrated dna solutions _ in vitro _ ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "this additional chiral interaction is also needed in models to discuss dna in solutions at high enough densities to form a cholesteric phase , and is well documented in that literature  @xcite . in the context of phage dna ,",
    "this interaction was never considered in simulations .",
    "its effect is dramatic : the ordering increases so that dna conformations now resemble much more fluctuating spools , and the main `` selection rules '' found in the experimental knot spectrum are very well reproduced , as the @xmath16 and @xmath7 twist knots are now extremely rare , and knots are typically chiral .",
    "torus knots outnumber twist knots in the simulations even for more complicated knots , such as 7-crossing ones , which were not analysed in detail experimentally .",
    "note that , for computational reasons , instead of the p4 genome a mutant containing half the genome ( and preserving the main features of the knot spectrum , as demonstrated in  @xcite ) .    a remaining intriguing question is how phages are able to efficiently eject their dna , which is the first step in the infection of a bacterial host , given that their genome is knotted with large probability , at least in the case of the p4 phage .",
    "the detailed simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest a possible resolution of this seemingly paradoxical issue . by analysing the knotted configurations , it was found that the knots generated using the chiral interaction just described are highly delocalised ( see section  [ size_knots ] for a definition and discussion of knot localisation ) .",
    "this is very different to what occurs in dna knots in swollen , uncompacted configurations , which are ( weakly ) localised .",
    "the delocalisation of the knot makes so that the local conformation which is found close to the opening of the phage where the dna gets out is not appreciably affected by the knot state of the dna , which is a global topological characteristic of the molecule . on the other hand , it is these local entanglements which are likely to impact on ejection dynamics , and hence knot delocalisation renders ejection relatively insensitive to the dna topology .",
    "more computational studies would be needed to further elucidate the interesting problem of knot ejection .",
    "the latest theoretical and computational investigations provide quantitative evidence in favour of the fact that the experimental spectrum reflects specific aspects of dna self - interaction ( namely cholesteric ordering ) that emerge at high dna packing densities  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that if a long polymer chain is in proximity of an attractive impenetrable surface , it may undergo a conformational transition from a _ desorbed phase _",
    ", where the chain likes to be extended in the bulk , to an _ adsorbed state _   where it is essentially localized at the surface",
    ".    therefore , the attractive substrate can be regarded as a means to realize polymer confinement .",
    "the average degree of adsorption of a long polymer is expected to depend significantly on the temperature of the system  @xcite .",
    "the latter , in fact , controls the balance between the loss of configurational entropy when the polymer adheres to the surface rather than being free in the bulk , and the energy gain , @xmath248 , for each monomer that is in contact with the attractive substrate .",
    "a crude estimate for this balance can be given by considering the entropy per monomer of the free polymer in three - dimensions , @xmath441 , and in two dimensions , @xmath442 ( clearly @xmath443 . the free energy per monomer of the fully desorbed and adsorbed states",

    "the salient physical mechanisms at play in this problem are best formulated by considering a partitioning of the ensemble of circular polymers into knotted and unknotted rings .",

    "can only correspond to adsorbed _ unknotted _ rings .",
    "only the latter , in fact , can be perfectly flat and thus guarantee that each single monomer is in contact with the surface .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that , as @xmath448 , ( i.e. well below the adsorption temperature for both sub - ensemble ) , the fraction of unknotted rings approaches 1 .    because of the complicated interplay of the two effects mentioned above",

    "so except in the limiting case of zero temperature , when the polygon flattens completely by fully adhering to the surface , the polygon is knotted with high probability .",
    "numerical calculations  @xcite indicate that , for a fixed value of the adsorption energy , @xmath248 , the knotting probability of sufficiently - long polymers is described by the following functional form : @xmath449 where @xmath114 is the number of polymer monomers .",

    "more stringent numerical investigations are needed in this respect . * up to now",

    "it would be interesting to examine how the entanglement of the rings is affected by extending the range of the attractive potential  ; * so far very dilute solutions have been considered . in the case of adsorption transition from semi - diluted solutions",
    "it would become necessary to account for the mutual entanglement of polymer rings .",
    "this problem leads to the largely - unexplored issue of how ring linking probability depends on the polymer concentration in proximity of the attractive surface , and on the strength of the adsorption itself .",
    "a further notable means of imposing spatial constraints on polymers is based on their direct _ mechanical _ manipulations . owing to technological advancements introduced in the past decade , it is presently possible to apply a variety of controlled types of confinement on few , or even single biopolymers  @xcite .",

    "the application of the force , which couples to the end - to - end distance of the chain , reduces the chain configurational entropy .",
    "it is therefore interesting to analyse how the equilibrium degree of entanglement of the chain is affected by the application of the tensile force .",
    "the latter question has been investigated for the case of lattice polygons  @xcite .",
    "the model was formulated so that the effects of both stretching and compression could be treated on common grounds .",

    "a more natural formulation of the linking problem is obtained by introducing an external constraint limiting the phase space of possible relative displacements of the two curves .",
    "a commonly - employed scheme is to prevent the separation of the centers of mass of the two curves from largely exceeding the average size of the rings .",
    "an alternative , more rigorous formulation of the problem consists of considering the ensemble of _ fixed linking type _ and calculating the limiting entropy of a system of two rings with a definite linked ( non trivial ) state .",
    "this approach has been used for linked pairs of polygons in the simple cubic lattice  @xcite and the results obtained are summarised hereafter .",
    "let us denote by @xmath524 the number of polygons pairs , each of @xmath114 bonds , forming a specific type of topological link ( meaning their type of concatenation ) , @xmath8 .",
    "when no restriction is introduced for the knot type of each component , it is expected that : @xmath525 i.e. the limiting entropy of a two - component ( non trivial ) link equals the one of the single polygon , independently on the link type .",
    "different results are obtained when the knot type of both components is kept fixed .",
    "suppose , for example , that neither of the two rings is knotted and let @xmath526 be the number of such embeddings in the cubic lattice .",
    "in this case it is possible to prove that , independently of the two - component link type @xmath8 , the following inequality holds : @xmath527 in other words , the key feature affecting the limiting entropy of a two - component link is not the topological linked state between the two rings but the requirement that _ both _ components are unknotted .",
    "conjecture _ that this holds true also if both components have a fixed non - trivial knot type @xmath528 : @xmath529 this result , albeit being a plausible generalization of what was established for unknotted polygons , has not been proved rigorously because of the difficulty in proving the existence of the following limit , @xmath530    inequality ( [ lim_link_unknot ] ) can be used to establish how the knotting probability @xmath531 that _ both _ components of the link of type @xmath8 are knotted grows as a function of @xmath114 .",

    "extension of these results to the links of higher dimensional structures ( @xmath34-spheres ) can be found in  @xcite .",
    "arguments similar to those in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite can be used to establish that the exponential growth rate of the number of topologically linked polygon pairs is equal to that of topologically unlinked polygon pairs .",
    "therefore , unlike the knotting probability , it can not be concluded that all but exponentially few sufficiently - long pairs of polygons are linked , even if the distance constraint is taken into account .",
    "this leaves open the possibility that the linking probability could still approach unity as @xmath533 but in this case it would not do so exponentially .",
    "it is important to stress once more that all the results presented above have been obtained by assuming that both rings have the same number of bonds , @xmath114 .",
    "the linking probability of two rings clearly depends on their spatial separation .",
    "when the distance of the centers of mass of the rings is much larger than the sum of their gyration radii , the linking probability of the rings will be zero .",
    "as the distance is progressively reduced it is intuitively expected that the linking probability increases .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine , by computational means , whether the expected monotonic increase is indeed observed within an equilibrated ensemble and whether the limiting value of the linking probability is 1 .",
    "the first numerical investigation of these two aspects was carried out by vologodskii et al .",
    "@xcite who considered random ( non self - avoiding ) polygons embedded on a body - centred cubic lattice . a monte carlo scheme , based on a chain - growth algorithm ,",
    "was first used to sample unrestricted conformations of a single polygon of @xmath114 bonds .",
    "next , several pairs of uncorrelated polygons were picked from the monte carlo generated ensemble .",
    "each pair was embedded in the lattice so that the centers of mass of the polygons were at a pre - assigned distance , @xmath535 , and their linked state was established by using the two - variable alexander polynomial @xmath536 . by repeating the process for each pair of rings the linking probability @xmath537 it was finally estimated . for ring lengths up to @xmath538 the numerical data were well - consistent with an exponential dependence of the linking probability on the separation , @xmath535 :    @xmath539    the effect of the excluded volume interaction on the pairwise linking probability of self - and mutual - avoiding rings ( on the simple cubic lattice ) was later studied in  @xcite . because of the self - avoiding nature of the rings , the efficiency of the simple sampling technique used in  @xcite is poor .",
    "an importance sampling method was used instead where polygon pairs , deformed by two - point pivot moves , were accepted according to a probability density that decreases rapidly with the separation of the rings centers of mass .",
    "suitable reweighting techniques ( see section  [ monte_carlo ] ) were next used to remove the effect of the external bias and compute the equilibrium ensemble averages .",
    "the linked state of each pair was probed by computing both the linking number ( homological linking ) and the alexander polynomial @xmath536 ( topological linking ) . for pairs of polygons , each with up to @xmath540 edges , the homological and topological linking probability as a function of @xmath535",
    "were calculated .",
    "in analogy with the knotting of ring polymers in confining geometries , the degree of the mutual entanglement turned out to be governed by the competition between two length scales , namely the gyration radius , proportional to @xmath541 , and the ring separation , @xmath535 .",
    "the linking probabilities calculated for various values of @xmath535 and @xmath114 are compatible with the following simple scaling relationship : @xmath542 which , in fact , yields a good collapse of the numerical data points for @xmath537 obtained for various values of @xmath114 and @xmath535 .",
    "the scaling relation of eq .  ( [ scaling_link_prob ] ) is consistent with the vanishingly small probability of having two polygons linked when their separation largely exceeds their typical size , i.e. when @xmath543 , and also captures the fact that upon bringing the rings progressively closer , the linking probability increases and ultimately reaches 1 . using numerical means the conditional probability that two topologically - linked rings ( i.e. @xmath544 ) are also homologically linked ( i.e. @xmath545 )",

    "very few results are available for the linking probability of two rings confined in @xmath230-slabs and @xmath342-prisms . in  @xcite this problem",

    "next , from the set of sampled polygon pairs , only the ones that fit into a @xmath230-slab or @xmath342-prism were retained ( rejection technique ) .",
    "the global qualitative features observed in  @xcite for the linking probability bear strong analogies to those observed for the knotting probability of a single ring subject to spatial confinement . in particular , the linking probability of polygon pairs confined in a @xmath230-slab or @xmath342-prism does not have a monotonic dependence on @xmath230 . in facts , there is a maximum value for a specific value of @xmath230 which depends on the polygon length , @xmath114 , but is independent of the scaling variable @xmath559 .",
    "this indicates that the knotting and linking probabilities ( respectively for a single ring and a pair of them ) are influenced in analogous ways by the introduction of geometrical constraints such as slabs or prisms .",
    "one of the latest investigations of this subject were carried out by soteros _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who studied , by rigorous arguments , the linking probability of pairs of mutually - avoiding polygons confined within a tube and having the same calliper size along the tube direction ( tube spanning constraint ) .",
    "the additional spanning constraint causes each bond of one polygon to be within a preassigned distance ( related to the tube diameter ) of bonds belonging the other polygon .",
    "this is a more stringent distance constraint than the one described before , which pertained to the centres of mass of the two rings . in this confining geometry",
    "rigorous results can be obtained for the linking probability of polygon pairs in a @xmath342-prism .",
    "in particular it is obtained that the _ homological _ linking probability goes to one at a rate at least of order @xmath565 ( analogously to what was discussed before for the urp model ) while the _ topological _ linking probability goes to one exponentially rapidly  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the linking number grows ( with probability one ) faster than any function @xmath566 but it can not grow faster than linearly in @xmath114 because of the prism constraint .",

    "these systems , while interesting _ per se _ can be viewed as a first approximation to more realistic systems where several rings can mutually entangle . in practical contexts ,",
    "these topological entanglements can occur when , for example , linear polymers in a concentrated solution undergo a closure reaction thus turning the geometrical entanglement of the open chains into linked states of high topologically complexity .",
    "the problem of mutual entanglement is manifestly important in the equilibrium and dynamical properties of concentrated solutions of polymers  .",
    "however , a topological characterization of this entanglement in equilibrium conditions is still largely unexplored and most of the available results have been established either numerically  ) or , in the case of melts , in the context of the tube model  .",
    "this model postulates that the mutual avoidance of the chains in a melt generates spatial constraints which effectively force each chain to reptate through a meandering tubelike region  @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for the widespread use of these concepts is that the geometrical constraint given by the tubular neighborhood is much easier to handle , and more amenable to calculations and simulations , than the topological constraints@xcite .",
    "a notable example is provided by the primitive - path method introduced a few years ago to analyze numerical simulations of dense polymer melts  @xcite .",
    "the method allows to characterize the viscoelastic behaviour of the melts in terms of properties of the network of the coarse - grained paths traced by polymers chains .",
    "an attempt to probe directly the topological complexity of concentrated polymer solutions and melts was carried out in refs .",
    "the method consisted of considering a specific configuration of the concentrated solution and to randomly `` drilling out '' from it a prism ( tube ) .",
    "next , the chain portions trapped in the prism are analysed .",
    "most of these trapped chains have their ends at the prism boundaries .",
    "these sub - chains can be both self - entangled and mutually entangled and this entanglement can be properly defined in terms of knotting and linking by bridging the two ends of each chain outside the prism ( see figure  [ fig : drilling ] panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "sometimes it is necessary to introduce extraneous crossings outside the prism but this number can be easily controlled ( see below ) .        by repeatedly applying this procedure",
    "it is possible , for example , to compute the probability that a certain type of chain linking is found in randomly - drilled prism etc .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , within this approach , the complicated problem of characterizing the equilibrium topological properties of concentrated solutions of polymer chains can be , to some extent , reduced ( or at least compared to ) to the simpler problem of the linking probability of @xmath55-components rings in @xmath342-prism .",
    "the above approach was further simplified in ref .   where the extracted prisms were subdivided into smaller pieces , such as cubes . in this case , each cube and the @xmath55 sub - chains within it form an entangled structure of @xmath55 strings where knotted and linked state can be rigorously defined ( see figure  [ fig : drilling ] ) .",
    "the topological properties of the entire prism can be inferred by properly identifying the boundary faces of the elementary cubes . a possible way of describing this system",
    ", that is also amenable of numerical and possibly analytical calculations , is in terms of a set of @xmath55 self- and mutually - avoiding walks on a cubic lattice suitably embedded in a cube of linear size @xmath230 .",
    "this model has been explored in details by monte carlo simulations and scaling arguments in  . in these studies",
    "it was calculated the linking number between two chains embedded in a cube and with their ends joined by arcs external to the cube . as mentioned above",
    "it is possible that an additional , extraneous , crossing is introduced during the closure outside the box .",
    "if this is the case the sign of this extra crossing is chosen at random with probability @xmath568 .",
    "this measure was later extended to @xmath55 chains by computing the @xmath569 linking numbers between pairs of chains .",
    "the absolute values of these @xmath569 linking numbers were finally summed algebraically so to obtained a single - valued measure , @xmath570 , of the degree of entanglement of a given arrangement of @xmath55 chains inside the @xmath230-cube .",
    "note that for @xmath571 the measure @xmath570 reduces to the linking number between two rings .",
    "the quantity @xmath570 was then averaged over the sampled configurations to form the statistical average @xmath572 .",
    "it turns out that for each @xmath230 and @xmath55 there is an initial set of values of the monomer density @xmath573 at which @xmath574 is approximately zero , and then increases roughly linearly with @xmath573 . as @xmath230 increases",
    ", the linear part of the curve becomes steeper and sets in at smaller values of @xmath573 .",
    "one expects that , in the regime where @xmath574 is close to zero , the @xmath55 chains will occupy essentially disjoint regions of space , while when @xmath574 is linear in @xmath573 the regions occupied by the chains will have substantial overlap .",
    "this corresponds roughly to the distinction between the dilute and semi - dilute regimes in polymer solutions  .",
    "in this situation , two length scales are competing : one is the box dimension @xmath230 while the second is the average extension @xmath284 of the single polymer chain in free space , @xmath575 , where @xmath114 is the number of polymer monomers . linking is expected to occur rarely when @xmath576 , and to be frequent when @xmath577 . since @xmath578 , at fixed @xmath230 the density @xmath579 at which linking is expectedly important is given by @xmath580 so that @xmath581    note that @xmath579 is the critical value of the density above which the system is in the semidiluted regime  .",
    "it is natural to formulate the hypothesis that the mutual entanglement @xmath582 is a function of the ratio of the two competing length scales , @xmath230 and @xmath284 : @xmath583 using the fact that @xmath584 one has @xmath585^{-\\nu}$ ] the dependence of @xmath570 on @xmath230 can be recasted in terms of a new function , @xmath43 : @xmath586 using flory s value @xmath587 this implies @xmath588 the validity of the above scaling relationship is confirmed by the good collapse of the numerical data points obtained by plotting @xmath574 as a function of @xmath589 .",
    "the collapse is particularly good for densities @xmath573 up to about @xmath590 . at higher densities",
    ", the collapse deteriorates , probably due to the onset of the melt regime ( @xmath591 )   where the efficiency of the monte carlo algorithm starts to deteriorate .",
    "more sophisticated sampling techniques are then necessary to look at the scaling regime of @xmath574 in the , still unexplored , region @xmath592 .",
    "a further possible extension of the above - mentioned problem is the study of the probability of occurrence of self - entanglement ( i.e. knotting ) and how this depends on melt concentration . in principle",
    "this could be done by joining the two ends of the same walk by an arc outside the cube , and calculating ( for instance ) the one - variable alexander polynomial of the resulting simple closed curve .",
    "the fourth part of this review , which comprises sections  [ topological_constrains ] and [ size_knots ] departs from the topics covered so far and which largely dealt with the characterization of the topological state of polymer chains that circularise in equilibrium .",
    "it is equally interesting , however , to characterize the physical properties of polymer chains whose topological state is fixed and can not be altered during the equilibrium fluctuation dynamics of the chain ( e.g. because the circularization occurs via a covalent bonding which is very resilient at room temperature ) . in this case , it is clearly not meaningful to investigate the knot spectrum .",
    "instead it is interesting to examine how the topological constraint affects the accessible configurational space of the polymer and , in turn , how this affects the polymer dynamics and equilibrium metric properties .",
    "these issues are covered in this last part of the review .",
    "in particular , the following questions will be addressed :    * to what extent does the presence of topological constraints influence the equilibrium properties of a single ring or a melt of rings ? * are the limiting configuration entropy and the average extension of rings with fixed topology different from the unconstrained counterparts ?",
    "* is there any dependence on the type of topological constraint imposed on the system ?",
    "in particular , do unknotted rings behave differently from rings with a nontrivial knot type ? * more generally , what are the salient configurational features of a spatially confined molecule with a given topology ?",
    "a good prototypical example of how the salient physical properties of a polymer ring can be influenced by fixing its topological state is provided by the gel electrophoresis  @xcite or stretching experiments  @xcite where a detectably different response is associated to various knot types .",
    "the presence of a topological constraint can have an even deeper impact if the chain is geometrically confined into thin slabs , narrow channels or small containers .",
    "this is because , in addition to the relevant lengthscales of the problem , i.e. the contour length , persistence length and width of the confining region , fixing the topological state introduces a further lengthscale , namely the size of the knotted region . for",
    "a knotted ring or a linear polymer the competition between topology and confinement can dramatically affect the translocation ability  @xcite .",
    "this has profound implications for the passage of a macromolecule through a narrow hole or channel , a phenomenon that is ubiquitous in biological systems .    furthermore , for a _ melt _ of rings in confined geometries the topological constraints can strongly enhance the effective ( entropic ) repulsion between rings which can dramatically affect their spatial arrangement",
    "indeed , this mechanism is believed to be an important ingredient in the spatial organization and segregation of highly confined dna molecules such as bacterial chromosomes  @xcite and eukaryotic chromosomes during interphase  @xcite ( see the discussion in section  [ topologically - constrained - and - concentrated ] ) .",
    "the available results on the subject are accompanied by a general overview of the main theoretical and computational challenges that arise in systems of fixed topology . in brief , the challenges on the analytical side arise from the fact that the ( global ) topological constraints prevents exploitation of the mapping between the statistics of rings with unrestricted topology and critical magnetic systems .",
    "field theory arguments can not be applied any more@xcite .    by necessity , most of the theoretical approaches to the problem therefore start from the assumption that it is possible to transfer scaling arguments developed in the unconstrained case to the fixed - topology one  @xcite and use numerical computation to support or verify _ a posteriori _ the validity of this hypothesis  @xcite . in turn , from the numerical perspective the difficulty stems from the fact that it is difficult to ensure _ a priori _ , that all the relevant configurational phase space is explored by stochastic modification of polymer rings which respects the given topological constraint .",
    "a conceptually - important feature of the fixed - topology problem answers the question of how large a fraction of the ring is occupied , on average , by a given knot type  @xcite .",
    "more precisely the following questions can be addressed :    * for knotted rings at equilibrium is the knot segregated into a small region in which all the topological details are confined or is it loosely spread over the entire chain ? * does the average length of the knotted region depends on physical parameters such as the polymerization degree , the stiffness of the chain , the quality of the solvent etc etc ? * for knotted rings confined within thin slabs , narrow channels or closed small containers , is the typical size of the knot altered by the degree of confinement ?",
    "all previous issues implicitly build on the notion that it is possible to measure the size of the knotted region within a ring .",
    "actually , this is a delicate conceptual point since the most natural way to perform this measure consists of extracting arcs from the full ring and looking for the presence of the knot within each of the excised arcs .",
    "this scheme makes manifest the ambiguity of the definition of the knot length because , as already mentioned , the notion of knottedness of an open arc can not be generally established except for very special circumstances , such as when the termini are subjected to suitable constraints , on in case of strong adsorption  . in other circumstances , there is no unique way to establish the knotted state of an open arc . as will be discussed in the review",
    ", this ambiguity can actually be exploited to define a probabilistic notion of knottedness of a given arc with a given ( fixed ) configuration , and valuable insight into the fixed - topology problem can be thus obtained .",
    "this is the subject of section  [ size_knots ] .",
    "in this section we shall report on the results available for topologically constrained rings .",
    "we shall first consider the case of isolated rings whose knotted state is fixed , and next move on to the case of several rings with a fixed type of mutual linking .",
    "these two situations are expected to arise from the polymer circularization in , respectively , dilute and dense polymer solutions .",
    "we first consider the case the of isolated self - avoiding rings of fixed knot type .      in principle",
    ", the equilibrium properties of a ring with a given knot type , @xmath8 , can be obtained by considering , in place of the full ensemble of configurations ( microstates ) , only those with the correct knot type @xmath8 .",
    "the introduction of this restriction usually makes it impractical to characterize analytically the equilibrium properties .",
    "the difficulty arises because the `` knottedness '' is a global property of the chain and , for example , can not be accounted for by adding to the energy function terms that favour / disfavour specific local geometries of the ring . for this reason",
    "there are very few theoretical results based on analytical and/or rigorous approaches .    from the fwd theorem ( see section  [ knot_prob ] )",
    "it is known that the limiting entropy of unknotted self - avoiding polygons , @xmath593 , exists and satisfies the inequality @xmath594 where @xmath167 is the limiting entropy of the whole set of rings ( i.e. summed over all the topologies ) .",
    "the question that rises naturally from inequality ( [ ineq_1 ] ) is the following : is it possible to prove rigorously the existence of the limiting entropy @xmath595 for rings with a given knot type @xmath8 ?",
    "moreover : is the strict inequality ( [ ineq_1 ] ) still valid if one replaces @xmath593 with @xmath595 ?",
    "while a complete answer to the problem is still lacking , the following rigorous results have been established .",
    "let @xmath596 be the number of @xmath114-bonds polygons whose knot type is @xmath8 .",

    "as previously discussed , the configurational entropy of a spatially - confined chain is clearly smaller than when it is unconstrained in the bulk .",
    "a ubiquitous type of polymer confinement is obtained in proximity of a surface .",
    "as the chain approaches the surface , the chain configurational entropy decreases producing a soft entropic force pushing the polymer away from the surface  .",
    "the case when the ring approaching the surface is knotted , and can not change the knot type , is a notable example of the interplay that can arise between geometrical and topological constraints . in particular",

    "is this force large enough to be detectable in single - molecule experiments ( which would hence provide a new means of detecting the ring topologies ) ?    to quantify the impact that topology can have on the free energy cost of placing a polymer close to a wall , consider the particularly simple case of a freely - jointed chain , made up of @xmath114 statistically - independent links , each of length @xmath105 , and rooted at a point at a distance @xmath653 from an impenetrable wall , which for defineteness we may take parallel to the @xmath654 plane and placed at @xmath655 .",
    "it is a simple polymer physics exercise to find the partition functions of a linear open and a ring polymer rooted , e.g. via the so - called image method  , in the continuum limit ( valid for @xmath656 ) .",

    "one can then find both the free energy loss due to the decrease in configurational entropy , and the repulsive entropic forces ( this is the derivative of the free energy with respect to distance from the wall ) .",
    "after some algebra it is possible to show that the repulsive force , for open and looped configurations , is respectively given by ( note that we keep the dependence on @xmath114 and @xmath653 ) @xmath659 these forces are plotted in figure  [ entropic_approach_curves_open_loop ] .",
    "it can be seen that the repulsive force builds up first for the open chain , whose statistical size is larger . however , upon close approach it is the ring which feels a stronger repulsive force .",
    "this different trend may be understood by comparing the change in the entropic exponent , @xmath172 , for a ring and an open chain when they are tied to a wall  .",
    "it is actually possible to show that , at least in the thermodynamic limit , the more complex the topological constraints are , the steeper the entropic repulsive force will rise for @xmath660 .",

    "the constant can be adjusted so that the free energy loss is 0 as @xmath665 .",

    "the effects of topological constraints where many chains are close together is difficult to investigate analytically and , with the exception of few findings based on perturbation analysis on an effective field theory of unlinked rings  , all the known results have been obtained by numerical investigations and scaling analysis  . within these approaches",
    "it was found that unknotted and unlinked rings in concentrated solutions are more compact than their linear counterparts .",
    "in particular the mean squared radius of gyration of a ring scales as @xmath355 with @xmath154 between @xmath687 and @xmath688 @xcite . this value is significantly smaller than the gaussian value @xmath568 expected in concentrated solutions and has a theoretical explanation based on the following flory - like argument  @xcite .    in section  [ virial_top ]",
    "we discussed the entropy loss of two unlinked rings brought progressively close .",
    "this entropy costs would give rise to an effective topological repulsion that adds to the mutual excluded volume interaction . while in dilute solutions",
    "this repulsion is overwhelmed by self - avoidance , in concentrated solutions it becomes more important , presumably because the crowded environment limits severely the amplitude of the conformational fluctuations of the rings .",
    "for an @xmath114-monomer ring of size @xmath284 , the intensity of this effect should be a function of the average number of overlapping rings @xmath55 that , in arbitrary dimension @xmath535 , should scale as @xmath689 .",
    "the @xmath55 neighbours act as obstacles for the given ring decreasing its conformational entropy .",
    "this gives a contribution to the free energy proportional to @xmath690 .",
    "this term favours a compact spatial organization of the ring . on the other hand an entropic penalty has to be paid if the ring is confined within a spherical cavity of radius @xmath691 .",
    "this penalty was estimated in the context of the flory theory for the coil - globule transition and scales as @xmath692 . by minimizing the sum of these two terms with respect to @xmath284",
    "one obtains @xmath693 with @xmath694 .",
    "note that in @xmath204 this gives @xmath695 , i.e. a value that closely agrees with the numerical estimates found in simulations   and with recent small - angle neutron scattering experiments carried out on cyclic polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms )  @xcite .",
    "later numerical investigations with higher values of @xmath114 and more detailed scaling arguments @xcite have revealed that actually the value @xmath696 describes the data in a crossover region of @xmath114 values separating the short @xmath114 regime , in which the topological interactions are weak and rings appear to be gaussian ( as their linear counterpart in concentrated solution ) , and the large @xmath114 regime in which the rings assume a more globular structure with @xmath697 .",
    "note that this large @xmath114 regime can be described in terms of a ring squeezed within a network of topological obstacles created in a self - consistent way by the surrounding rings  .      a notable system where the above mentioned effects could be at play is given by chromosome territories .",
    "most of a cell s life is spent to perform a variety of functions , including preparation for cell division .",
    "this phase of the cell cycle is known as _ interphase _  whereas division occurs during _ mitosis _",
    "interphase and mitosis are arguably the most important of the phases in the cell s cycle .",
    "most of us associate chromosomes with elongated x - like structures : however these shapes are only observed during mitosis , when chromosomes condense and become more readily visible . on the other hand , during interphase , chromosomes are better described described as swollen polymers with thickness of approximately 30 nm ( the diameter of the chromatin fiber ) and persistence length in the 40 - 200 nm range , confined in a quasi - spherical volume ( the eukaryotic nucleus )  @xcite.while theory predicts that linear polymers should strongly intermingle in confinement if in thermodynamic equilibrium ( see e.g. the discussions in  @xcite ) chromosomes instead segregate into spatially distinct regions , or _",
    "territories_.    a possible explanation to this effect is that the physics of interphase chromosomes is strongly dominated by out - of - equilibrium effects .",
    "this is at the basis of the proposal by rosa and everaers in  @xcite , who suggest that the observed segregation is kinetically driven .",
    "the key idea behind the simulations in  @xcite is that chromosomes enter interphase ( the `` ordinary '' cellular phase and hence the one with the longest time duration ) after the mitotic chromosome separation .",
    "therefore , the starting mitotic chromosome configurations are compact and well segregated . consistently with this fact , rosa and everaers chose the initial configurations of the model chromosome as solenoidal structures in which loops are stacked up in a cylindrical state . by means of large scale parallel simulations , the authors managed to follow the dynamics of one or a few polymers as long as a human chromosome starting from a mitotic state .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were introduced to model what happens in the nucleus where chromosomes are close to each other .",
    "such long polymers were found to not be able to equilibrate and intermingle , so that they remain segregated as in the initial mitotic configuration , at least when interstrand crossing was disallowed .",
    "interestingly , yeast chromosomes are about two orders of magnitude shorter than human ones , thus equilibrate much faster  indeed neither molecular dynamics simulations nor experiments show territories in yeast chromosomes .    chromosome territories , however , may also originate from _ thermodynamic _ forces . in this case",
    ", it is topological and entropic repulsion which can lead to segregation  @xcite . according to this explanation ,",
    "there are scaffolding dna binding proteins which act as ties  @xcite forcing a looped topology on chromatin in interphase chromosomes .",
    "simple steric repulsion between rosettes on different chromosomes made up by joining several loops can then be estimated to lead effectively to segregation  .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite also considered an ensemble of equilibrated unlinked freely - jointed loops and demonstrated that these too can segregate , which shows that segregation can be purely topologically driven .",
    "lattice simulations of very long ring polymers also support this view  @xcite .",
    "of course , the kinetic and thermodynamic explanation are not necessarily mutually exclusive and in reality they could complement each other .    in any case , our understanding of the physical and topological properties of interphase chromosomes is still far from conclusive , and both theoretical and experimental breakthroughs are in order before a satisfactory picture can be reached .",
    "for instance , the role of the looping proteins , or `` ties '' mentioned above might lead to interchromosomal , as well as intrachromosomal , contacts .",
    "how is this avoided in practice ?",
    "apart from the segregation into territories , what is the local and global organization of one interphase chromosome ? it is likely that in order to answer questions like these a serious revision of the force field used to characterise confined dna will be needed .",
    "once more , large scale simulations may safely be anticipated to be the primary method of investigation .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the problem of chromosome segregation in eukaryotes to that in prokaryotes . in bacteria like _ e. coli _ , the genome is circular , and replication is concurrent with the segregation of the sister chromosomes  @xcite .",
    "apart from the topology of the genome , looped versus linear , there is also a fundamental generic difference between chromosome segregation in bacteria and in eukaryotes : the geometry of confinement .",
    "while the nucleus is essentially spherical , bacterial cells which contain the dna are typically elongated : for instance _ e. coli _ may be modelled as an ellipsoid with one major axis and two nearly degenerate minor ones .",
    "the ratio between major and minor axes varies between 2 and 4 in the wild - type ( the variability is due to the fact that the cells grow while replicating ) .",
    "these two differences both help segregation and it has recently been proposed in  @xcite , on the basis of scaling arguments and numerical simulations , that entropic forces alone ( i.e. self - avoidance ) are enough to lead to chromosome segregation in a slowly dividing _",
    "e. coli_. this is mainly because an elongated geometry entropically favours configurations where the two sister chromosomes do not mix .",
    "although the scenario may thus seem simpler in bacteria , the number of open questions is just as impressive as for the eukaryotic case  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the lab _",
    "e. coli _ cells usually divide much more rapidly than in a minimal medium , with the `` firing '' of multiple replication origins , which leads to the coexistence of more than two chromosomes in a cell .",
    "what happens in this case , which is topologically more complex than the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ?    furthermore , most experimental evidence points to the fact that the dna in bacteria is strongly supercoiled , and it would be extremely interesting to understand how this impacts the structure of the bacterial dna during replication .",
    "the development of ever more accurate bacterial cell biology experiments is also likely to shape our understanding of the biophysics of the bacterial genome .",
    "for example , in an interesting recent study  @xcite white _ et al .",
    "_ have shown experimental evidence which suggests that chromosome segregation in _ e. coli _ is not random but is driven in a manner that results in the leading and lagging strands being addressed to particular cellular destinations .",
    "it may therefore be that entropic forces are complemented by active ones ( e.g. due to a segregation protein machinery ) in order to ensure an error - free cell replication .",
    "in section  [ fixed_knot ] , in order to understand the scaling behaviour of the entropic and metric properties of polymer rings with fixed knot type , we used the working hypothesis that knots are tightly tied in the chain .",
    "this assumption could be verified _ a posteriori _ by looking at the statistics of the effective size of the knotted region within the chain .",
    "questions that may be relevant in this respect are for example the following :    * what is the average size of the knotted portion of a ring in equilibrium ? * what is the fraction of the chain contour length that is taken up by the knot ? * how do the above properties depend on external conditions such as the quality of the solvent , the degree of a spatial confinement , the intensity of an applied stress etc ?    the above questions can be made more precise if formulated through the notion of the _ degree of localization of a knot_. in the following we shall denote with @xmath114 the total number of bonds in the ring , and with @xmath698 the average length ( in unit of chain bonds ) of the region where the knot of type @xmath8 resides .",
    "three possible scenarios can occur :    1 .",
    "when , upon increasing @xmath114 , @xmath698 increases more slowly than any power of @xmath114 , then the knot is said to be _ strongly localized _ within the ring .",
    "note that this definition includes either the situation where @xmath698 grows as any power of @xmath699 or the case in which is @xmath700 is independent on @xmath114 .",
    "2 .   when @xmath698 is @xmath701 but yet grows as @xmath430 , with @xmath702 , then the the knot is said to be _ weakly localized_. in this situation it is possible that short chains display knotted region that are comparable in size with the whole chain and only for very large ( depending on @xmath47 ) values of @xmath114 the knotted region becomes negligible relatively to the chain contour length .",
    "3 .   finally ,",
    "when @xmath698 is proportional to @xmath114 then the knot is said to be _",
    "delocalized_.      the major difficulty one encounters in estimating @xmath703 relies on the notion of _ knotted arc _ that , in general , can not be defined rigorously ( see section  [ openknots ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if we consider open equilateral chain the standard definition of knot type ( see section  [ knot_theory ] ) will tell us that such curves are unknotted .",
    "this is because an open piecewise chain with a knot tied in it can be deformed , possibly with moves that do not preserve edge lengths , into a straight line without passing the curve through itself .",
    "notice , however , that by using only edge - preserving moves it is not presently known whether an arbitrary configuration of an equilateral piece - wise linear chain can be deformed into a straight segment ( and such deformations have been proven to be impossible for certain non - equilateral chain configurations )  @xcite .",
    "there are cases , however , where the notion of knotted arc can be well defined .",
    "simple examples are open chains in which the two extremities lay at the surface of a three - ball ( i.e. homeomorphic to a the standard three ball @xmath704 ) that contains all the rest of chain .",
    "indeed , in this case the definition of knotted arc can be made rigorous through the idea of knotted ball pair introduced in section  [ knot_prob_conf ] and more carefully defined in  .",
    "this can be easily seen for the class of _ unfolded _ self - avoiding walks since they can be uniquely completed to @xmath705 ball - pairs . to see how the construction works",
    "let us consider for example the set of @xmath51-_unfolded _ walks  @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by having the @xmath51 coordinates with the property @xmath706 for @xmath707 .",
    "we add half - edges in the negative and positive @xmath51-direction to the first and last vertices of the walk and construct a @xmath243-ball with two parallel faces perpendicular to the @xmath51-axis , and four more faces ( perpendicular to the remaining coordinate directions ) so that the walk ( and the added half - edges ) is properly embedded in the @xmath243-ball . the walk and the @xmath243-ball containing it form uniquely a @xmath705 ball - pair for which the notion of knot is well defined .",
    "unfortunately , although unfolded walks are not exponentially rare in the set of all saws  , they are still too rare to search for them within a long walk as possible candidates of knotted regions .",
    "even if the above scheme based on unfolded walk is not going to solve the problem of how define a knotted arc _ for any arc _ it does suggest some useful extensions  @xcite .    1 .   one idea is to choose a direction at random and construct two parallel rays , whose origins are the two extremities of a given walk and which are parallel to the chosen direction .",
    "since all such rays will have irrational direction cosines they will not pass through any of the vertices of the cubic lattice . if we regard the two rays to join themselves at the point at infinity the resulting curve is a closed curve that will be , almost surely , simple . for this closed curve",
    "the topological entanglement is well defined and can be detected for example by computing some invariants .",
    "note that in general the value of the invariant will depend on the chosen direction so it will be convenient to average over all directions .",
    "the main problem of this construction is that it can create or destroy entanglements .",
    "for instance , a knotted arc present in the chain may not be necessarily detected as as being knotted upon closure , because one of the rays might pass through the @xmath243-ball associated with the knotted arc thus unknotting the curve ( see figure  [ fig : false_knot ] ) .",
    "depite these potential pittfalls , closing over all possible directions has been shown to yield robust results for both compact and unconstrained ring configurations .",
    "its main limitation resides in the heavy computational cst associated with the repeated calculation of knot invariants .",
    "a robust and more computationally - effective alternative is offered by the minimal - entanglement closure scheme introduced recently by some of us@xcite .",
    "an alternative and apparently simpler closing scheme is to join the ends of the arc with a line segment .",
    "the immediate problem is that the added line segment will in general pass through vertices of the lattice and the resulting closed curve might not be a simple curve ( i.e. not self - avoiding ) .",
    "one way to get around this problem is to add to the ends of the walk two parallel line segments ( of length say @xmath708 ) in a direction with irrational direction cosines , and then join up the end points of the resulting object to form a closed curve that is almost always a simple closed curve . as for the previous scheme the knot detection may depend on the direction cosines chosen so that an averaging over them might be necessary .",
    "clearly , also in this case the addition of the segment closing the curve may change the entanglement status of the starting arc .",
    "it is clear from the schemes described above that the closing construction is not unique and so is the detection of the topological entanglement in the arc .",
    "this uncertainty poses severe problems for a `` deterministic '' definition of knotted arc .",
    "one may rely instead on a more probabilistic approach as suggested in  @xcite and outlined in section [ openknots ] .",
    "the idea consists in analyzing the spectrum of knots generated by multiple closures of the same open chain .",
    "each closure is obtained by connecting the ends of the chain to a point chosen ( randomly ) on the surface of a sphere that contains the walk .",
    "different closures correspond to different chosen points on the sphere . for each fixed open chain",
    "a distribution of knots is estimated and the _ most probable knot _ gives the knot type of the open chain .",
    "interestingly enough it turns out that the knot obtained by a simple direct end - to - end closure usually coincides with the knot type that dominates the random closure spectrum  @xcite",
    ".      a definition of knotted arcs and knot size may be much easier to formulate for _ flat knots _  , a simplified model which has played an important role in the development of ideas concerning localization and delocalization properties of real knots in equilibrium  .",
    "flat knots are closed curves in the plane , e.g. in the square lattice , that can be seen as quasi-2d projections of 3d knots .",
    "physically they can be realized by adsorbing 3d polymer rings on a strongly attractive planar surface  @xcite or membrane or by confining the polymer between two close parallel walls ( see the model introduced in   and mentioned in section  [ knot_prob_ads ] ) . in these cases",
    "the flat knots can still equilibrate in 2d .",
    "macroscopic realization of flat knots comes also from experiments in which macroscopic knotted chains are flattened by gravity onto a vibrating plane  @xcite .",
    "flat knots have the advantage of being relatively easy to image by microscopy  @xcite and can be studied theoretically either by numerical or analytical approaches on properly defined two - dimensional models  @xcite . a model of flat knots on a lattice",
    "was first proposed in   where , the authors considered configurations embedded in the square lattice where the bonds lie on lattice edges except in correspondence of chain crossings ( over / under - passes ) where the diagonals of a _ single _ lattice square are used ( see figure  [ fig : flatknots]a ) . with this model a numerical estimate of the entropy and the average extension of flat knots with a given fixed , topology was carried on .",
    "the stochastic sampling was based on bfacf plus some additional moves corresponding to lattice versions of reidemeister moves on knot diagrams .",
    "these moves assure a good mobility within the space of flat knots with a given knot type that is defined by the initial configuration corresponding to a projection of a knotted curve in 3-space .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    this investigation shows that the connective constant of flat knots is independent of knot type , to numerical accuracy , and that @xmath709 where @xmath710 is the number of prime components in the knot @xmath8 and @xmath617 is the exponent that enters in a scaling equation similar to ( [ scaling_entropy_tau ] ) where @xmath596 is replaced by the number of @xmath114-bonds flat knots with a given knot type @xmath8 . by computing the mean squared radius of gyration it was also shown that the critical exponent @xmath154 of flat knots is , within error bars , independent of the knot type .",
    "although a detailed study of tightness was not carried out , in   it was observed that the knotted regions were typically very small compared to the rest of the ring ( see figure  [ fig : flatknots]b for a typical configuration of the composite knot @xmath711 . ) note that all the results presented above for flat knots agree with the ones found for real knots in 3d ( see section  [ fixed_knot ] ) indicating that , at least for some properties , flat knots are a fair approximation of real knots . as for real knots the investigations in   refer to the asymptotic behaviour of the entropy and of the average size of flat knots .",
    "these furnish an indirect measure of the knot size . by exploring the properties of flat knots in the limit in which they display a minimal number of crossings it is possible to better characterize the size of the knotted region",
    ". this will be the subject of the next section .      in the model presented in   the number of non essential crossings",
    "were free to fluctuate in the ensemble .",
    "if , on the other hand , the number of overlaps of the polymer ring with itself is restricted to the minimum compatible with the topology ( e.g. 3 for a @xmath86 knot ) the flat knot model enjoys a drastic simplification .",
    "with this approximation an analytic approach to the problem of the size of a flat knot is possible  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to interpret the essential self - overlaps of the chain as vertices of a two - dimensional polymer network , for which a well developed theory exists ( see for example ,   and @xcite ) . by exploiting results coming from this theory it was possible to discuss the scaling of the length distribution of prime flat knots and predict a _ strong localization regime",
    "_  @xcite ( i.e. @xmath712 ) .",
    "this prediction was confirmed by monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of getting both analytical results and quite sharp numerical estimates on the localization of flat knots has recently stimulated an extension of this model that incorporates an attractive vertex - vertex interaction as a pseudo - potential to mimic poor solvent conditions .",
    "this gives the possibility of looking at the average size of the knotted regions as a function of the quality of the solvent and see , in particular if the knot localization property found in the swollen phase may be affected by the coil - globule ( @xmath129 ) transition  @xcite .    by simulating numerically this _ self - attracting flat knots _ model",
    "it was found  @xcite that while in the good solvent regime the knots are strongly localized , consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in the globular state flat knots are delocalized , ( i.e. @xmath713 ) . right at the @xmath129-temperature weak localization prevails with @xmath714 .",
    "this last result can be explained by extending the scaling theory of polymer networks of fixed topology at the @xmath129 point   and assuming that the configurations having the shape of a figure eight dominate the statistics in that regime  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : flat_diag ] ) .",
    "this assumption , supported by the numerical data , leads us to speculate that the exact value of @xmath47 is @xmath715  @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the above assumption is rejected the leading scaling order of any prime flat knot is the uncontracted configuration ( see figure  [ fig : flat_diag ] ) that is delocalized , i.e. @xmath716 , also at the @xmath129 point  @xcite .",
    "as anticipated in sections [ openknots ] and [ knotted_arc ] the identification , in a knotted ring , of the shortest ring segment containing the knot is a difficult and , in general , ambiguous problem .",
    "for this reason the number of studies available on this topic is still limited and largely restricted to numerical investigations .",
    "one of the earliest attempts to measure the length of the knotted region for polymer rings at equilibrium was done in  @xcite .",
    "this investigation was carried out with a monte carlo sampling of equilateral random polygons . in this work the identification of the _ minimal knotted arc _ was carried out following procedures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in section  [ knotted_arc ] .",
    "for polygons with @xmath717 bonds it was found that the typical length of the minimal knotted arc were about 6 to 8 for trefoils , about 15 for figure eight knots and about 20 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 . since this investigation",
    "was done for one value of @xmath114 it is difficult to put these results within the context of knot localization .",
    "nevertheless the general conclusion was that knots were typically tight .    in  @xcite a first study of knot localization for lattice polygons in a good solvent regime",
    "was carried out by monte carlo simulations using the bfacf algorithm . since bfacf is ergodic within each knot class it was possible , for a fixed knot type @xmath8 , to consider several values of @xmath114 and to explore properly the statistics of the knotted regions .",
    "these regions were detected by using a variant of the _ cutting and closure _ schemes outlined in section  [ knotted_arc ] that allows one to minimize the risk of knot modifications or disentanglements during the closure of the subwalk . by detecting the minimal knotted arc in polygons having knot type @xmath86 and with @xmath114 up to @xmath718 , it was found @xmath719 where @xmath431 for the good solvent regime .",
    "this result turns out to be robust with respect to a change of prime knot type .",
    "for example by replacing the @xmath86 with a @xmath16 or @xmath6 or @xmath720 knot , the scaling behaviour ( [ weak ] ) remains valid with the same ( within error bars ) estimated value of @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "these results for the good solvent regime are qualitatively consistent with a molecular dynamics study by mansfield  @xcite who , back in 1998 , showed maximally - tight knots in a polymer becomes is loosened up by the dynamical evolution of the polymer ( hence suggesting that equilibrated knots are not strongly localized ) .    at the same time",
    "it should be noted that a more recent study by mansfield and douglas reported a value of @xmath721 for trefoil knots occurring in self - avoiding rings on a cubic lattice .",
    "this value is appreciably different from the one reported before and prompts for further investigations of the source of this discrepancy . in particular , it is possible that the difference reflects the fact that in ref .",
    ", only a subset of the possible subportions of a ring are considered as candidate segments accommodating the knot .",
    "specifically , considerations are restricted only to those ring segments that have both ends at the surface of the whole ring so to eliminate topological ambiguities upon closure .",
    "it is not implausible that introducing this selection criterion can results in different statistical properties of the shortest knotted segments .",
    "it is important to stress that the above _ direct _ approaches to measuring the size of the minimal knotted arc strongly rely on the assumption that the closure procedure does not systematically introduce artifacts in the detection of the arc topology .",
    "this condition ought to be realised in the good solvent regime where ring configurations are not compact . on the other hand , in situations such as the poor solvent regime where the whole polymer is quite compact and",
    "strongly geometrically entangled , this condition is not expected to hold .    to circumvent the problem , marcone _ et al _",
    "@xcite recently proposed a novel strategy to identify the knotted arc of minimal length .",
    "the method exploits the so - called _ entropic competition _ between two unlinked , mutually - avoiding , knotted sub - loops obtained by introducing a _ slip ring _ in the full ring .",
    "the slip ring is small enough to prevent a complete migration of one sub - loop , or of its knot , into the other sub - loop ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite for related works ) .",
    "the whole topology of the system is characterized by the knot types @xmath722 and @xmath723 , respectively , of the first and the second sub - loop , and by the linking state between the two loops .    in the formulation of marcone _",
    "et al _ , the rings in the poor solvent regime are described by polygons on the cubic lattice with an effective attraction between non consecutive vertices .",
    "this model is known to be adequate for reproducing the salient features of the coil - globule transition ( @xmath129 point ) and the equilibrium properties of the rings in the compact regime . by using a monte carlo approach based on bfacf",
    "moves the overall topology of the system was kept fixed and it was studied how the sub - rings shrunk or inflated depending on their topological state .",
    "we recall that the sub - rings are assumed to be unlinked .",
    "if a given prime knot @xmath8 is tied in each loop one can identify the average knot size @xmath724 with the length of the smallest loop .    in the good solvent regime the above scheme yields @xmath725 with @xmath431 .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the findings based on the closure scheme . for poor solvents",
    "the estimate was @xmath726 .",
    "this indicates that knots are weakly localized in the good solvent regime but are fully delocalized in the poor solvent regime .",
    "this behaviour was later confirmed in  @xcite for an off - lattice model .",
    "another approach that could be effective either in the swollen or in the compact regime is the one introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the method builds on the idea of quantifying the degree of tightness of knotted polymers by comparing the response to mechanical pulling ( force - extension relation ) of knotted and unknotted chains . by simulating rod - bead chains with @xmath114 ( the number of beads ) up to @xmath727 it",
    "was found @xmath728 in the swollen regime  @xcite .",
    "this result agrees with the one in  @xcite in showing that knotted polymers in the extended phase are weakly localized although the estimate of @xmath47 is considerably smaller .      a possible link between the theory of flat knots and knot localization in @xmath161 is given by the phenomena of polymer adsorption onto an impenetrable plane  @xcite ( see section [ knot_prob_ads ] ) .",
    "it is known that , in the case of unrestricted topology , this system exhibits a phase transition between a _ desorbed phase _ ( zero density of contacts with the surface ) and an _ adsorbed phase _ where there is finite fraction of monomers at the surface",
    ". this fraction increases with decreasing temperature and at zero temperature the polymer is practically a fully adsorbed @xmath729 object ( see section  [ knot_prob_ads ] ) . if , on the other hand , the topology of the polymer is kept fixed , there will be a certain number of desorbed monomers . while the exact number of expected desorbed monomers can not be predicted , it is plausible that it is simply related to the minimal number of crossings necessary to satisfy the given knot type . at very small temperature , the statistics should be dominated by fully - adsorbed configurations having the minimal number of desorbed monomers .",
    "thus , in adsorption conditions , it is possible to investigate how a knotted polymer ( e.g. in good solvent ) crosses over from the weak localisation regime found at high @xmath119 to the strong localisation one corresponding to the occurrence of flat knots . in a recent study",
    "this interplay between topology and adsorption was investigated within a standard lattice polymer model  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the polymer ring was described by _ positive polygons _",
    "i.e. lattice polygons confined to the half space @xmath730 and with at least one vertex anchored at the @xmath731 plane . for a given configuration an energy @xmath732 is assigned , where @xmath733 is the number of vertices in the surface @xmath731 . usually @xmath734 . the monte carlo sampling was based on bfacf moves while the determination of knot size was based on the cutting and closure scheme introduced in  @xcite . by exploring the whole adsorption phase diagram for the prime knots @xmath86 , @xmath16 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , it was found that knots in the desorbed phase and right at the transition are weakly localised .",
    "below the transition ( @xmath735 ) , the knot becomes more and more localised , reaching a strong localisation regime deep into the adsorbed phase .",
    "this crossover to more localised states is certainly triggered by the adsorption transition but turns out to be quite smooth as @xmath119 decreases .",
    "in particular , on the basis of the collected data , it could not be ruled out that below @xmath447 there is a continuous variation of the exponent @xmath47 with the flat knot regime reached only in the limit @xmath451 . an alternative scenario would be the existence of a genuine _ localization _ transition at some @xmath736 , where the region @xmath737 would correspond to the strong localization regime .",
    "this appealing scenario is however less probable unless one assumes that the data in  @xcite are affected by strong finite - size corrections .",
    "with the exception of the above cited study in  @xcite there are no other investigations on the interplay between topological constraints and polymer adsorption .",
    "it would be interesting , for example , to perform similar studies for off - lattice models of polymer rings in which self - avoidance and bending rigidity are taken into account .",
    "this would be an interesting issue to explore given that experimental results showing localization in adsorbed knots are nowadays available  @xcite .",
    "the above results indicate that the presence of a topological constraint introduces a new length scale @xmath738 into the problem that may affect the scaling properties of knotted rings at equilibrium . in the swollen phase , since @xmath739 ( weak localization ) , the new length scale is subdominant and would not affect the leading behaviour of scaling laws such as eqs .",
    "( [ scaling_entropy_tau ] ) and ( [ r2scalknot ] ) .",
    "it may have , however , important consequences in the leading term of the correction to scaling expansion as shown in  @xcite . in the collapse regime , since @xmath740 , @xmath741 is comparable to the average extension of the whole polymer and changes in the scaling theory , already at leading orders may occur . for example , there are strong numerical indications that relation ( [ entr_exp ] ) is not valid for compact knotted rings  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a new , topological , length scale may also be important in determining the equilibrium properties of knotted polymer rings under geometrical confinement or under stretching forces .",
    "for example for polymers under geometrical confinement two crossover regimes may be considered .",
    "the first one occurs when the effective confining size , @xmath230 , is comparable to @xmath284 though still larger than @xmath741 .",
    "in this situation the knot , does not experience , on average , the confinement and the scaling behaviour such as eq .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) should hold . if , on the other hand , @xmath742 then the knotted region will be affected by confinement . in this case",
    "it would be interesting to explore whether the knot would further localize or instead delocalize , as suggested by the numerical study of knotting in spherically - confined dna molecules described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a confinement - induced knot localization is probably at play in the case of polymer rings confined into slab as @xmath743 where we know from the theory of flat knots that almost @xmath729 knots are strongly localized .",
    "similar non trivial effects may be expected for stretched rings when the screening length @xmath464 becomes comparable to the average knot size @xmath741 and a single knot can not fit in a single blob of the pincus argument . with the exception of very preliminary studies in  @xcite and  @xcite , these issues are still largely unexplored and would represent very appealing avenues for future research .",
    "the focus of review was mostly on the salient properties of polymers chains subject to spatial or topological constraints .    although these systems are highly interesting from the theoretical and applicative points of view several of their key physical properties are still not fully understood .",
    "for example , the exact value of the metric exponent of infinitely - thin rings with a fixed knot type is still actively investigated and debated .",
    "an increasingly important avenue is also offered by biological systems , where spatially - confined long biopolymers ( dna and rna ) are ubiquitous . this poses the pressing need to understand the extent to which the in vivo organization of these biomolecules relies on `` passive '' physical mechanisms or `` active '' ones involving biological machinery .",
    "the first three chapters of the review provide a self - contained account of all the basic concepts and methodologies in polymer physics and topology that are be necessary to tackle the state - of - the - art problems .    in particular , sections",
    "[ sec:2 ] and [ knot_theory ] can be regarded as a primer to the topology of closed curves .",
    "non - specialists will be progressively introduced to the topic starting from basic questions such as : what is a knot ?",
    "what is the handedness of a given knot ?",
    "how can we classify knots ?",
    "next , in section [ pol_models ] , we offer a didactical survey of the standard models that are used to characterise and study the kinetics and thermodynamics of polymers . since we typically focus on universal , or transferable , physical properties of polymers subject to various constraints , we restrict considerations to _ coarse grained _ models . in these approaches ,",
    "the polymer is described at a much coarser level then in atomistic approaches which are , in fact , more tailored to address the detailed properties of a specific type of polymer .",
    "the simplified nature of the models that we shall review , is not for the sake of a general and minimalistic statistical mechanical formulation of the problem ; it is often an obligatory choice to keep the complexity of the problem at a manageable level .",
    "indeed , global properties , such as polymer self - avoidance and spatial or topological constraints , are extremely difficult to deal within analytical approaches and can only be satisfactorily accounted for in extensive computational approaches .    in section [ monte_carlo ]",
    "we have accordingly reviewed the most advanced stochastic algorithms for studying the equilibrium properties of confined or entangled polymers .",
    "we note that there are additional methods which become relevant when non - equilibrium or kinetic effects become important .",
    "these methods typically involve brownian or molecular dynamics simulations , or generalisations thereof .",
    "while we do report on selected problems where kinetic effects are important , we do not review these methods here , but refer the reader to the several authoritative methodological reviews that are presently available .",
    "after introducing the fundamental theoretical concepts and methodologies , we first characterize the behaviour of a single polymer subject to geometric confinement .",
    "specifically , in sections [ confined_polymers ] and [ knot_prob_conf ] we discuss the statistical and topological properties of confined polymers and rings .",
    "particular attention is paid to the so - called knot spectrum  that is the frequency of occurrence of various knot types  of confined polymers , starting from lattice models ( for which analytical results are available ) to more complex off - lattice models of flexible chains .",
    "the physical description of such systems is complicated due to the interplay of various length scales , i.e. the contour length , persistence length , excluded - volume interaction range , and finally the confining region size . in general",
    ", the effect of confinement is to make the incidence of knots much more frequent than in unconstrained cases .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "quantitative estimates of the level of topological entanglement computed for standard models of dna subject to high confinement ( such as the genome of some viria ) largely exceeds the ones detected experimentally . in section [ dna_capsid ]",
    "we report on the quest that has been undertaken in recent years to bridge the gap between the theoretical and experimental data on dna knotting and which has been instrumental in advancing the current understanding of the physics of confined dna . besides the open issues regarding dna knotting in viria and in the cell",
    ", there are a number of outstanding questions regarding the topology of confined polymers in general . among these we largely focused on the case of polymer confinement in slabs and prisms , which ought to acquire increasing importance with the advent of nano - fabrication techniques .    likewise , when confinement is induced by an attractive interaction to a surface , which we study in section [ knot_prob_ads ] ,",
    "it is still unclear whether there is a topology - dependent character of the adsorption transition . as discussed in section [ knot_prob_stress ] , little",
    "is known about how many and what knot types occur in stretched polymers . again",
    "the latter may well be soon extensively characterized experimentally by means of single - molecule manipulation techniques .    the remainder of the review deals with cases where the entanglement is not driven by spatial confinement but rather by the proximity of other chains in concentrated solutions or cases where topological constraints affect the geometric properties of polymer rings .",
    "the characterization of the equilibrium topological properties of polymers in concentrated solutions is given in sections [ sec:3rdpart ] and [ linking ] .",
    "in these sections the reader is first introduced to the concept of linked curves and to the various algorithms that have been designed by topologists to detect computationally the linked state of polymer rings .",
    "the presented results mostly focus on the linking probability of two or more rings as a function of the concentration .",
    "this topic has been actively investigated and several exact results are available for polymer on a lattice . several major issues , including the impact that the linking or unlinking has on the configurational properties of polymers in dense solutions is still largely uncharacterised .    sections [ sec:4thpart ] and [ topological_constrains ]",
    "are devoted instead to the case where the topological state of the polymer(s ) is fixed . in this case",
    "it is interesting to understand how and to which extent the topological constraint reverberates on the geometrical properties of the polymer chains .",
    "these systems are challenging to simulate .",
    "in fact , it is typically necessary to sample the polymer configurational space by using topology - preserving polymer deformations which are , by necessity , local .",
    "this is reflected in the very long autocorrelation time of the stochastic monte - carlo or molecular dynamics simulation . at the same time , this type of problems is most interesting and connects to a number of open questions in polymer physics .",
    "these range from fundamental issues such as the determination of the universality class and critical exponents which characterise the infinitely - thin ring with fixed topology ( see section [ metr_fixed_knot ] ) , to very applied and highly interdisciplinary problems , such as the segregation of chromosomes in eukaryotic and bacterial cells ( this problem is reviewed in section [ chromterr ] ) . indeed ,",
    "while in the nucleus and in the cell there are enzymes which allow crossing of dna strands and hence the changing of the knot and link states of the genome , the action of these enzymes requires energy and time so that the fixed topology case is a good starting point and has been analysed with increasing attention by biophysicists .",
    "the problem of territories and in general of the structure and 3-dimensional organization of chromatin and bacterial dna are fascinating open problems which have just now begun to be studied by physicists .",
    "preliminary results suggest that confinement , crowding and topology should all be crucial to the understanding of these phenomena , and this area seems a particularly promising playground for the physics and topology of confined and concentrated polymers .",
    "finally , section [ size_knots ] introduces the study of the `` length '' of a knot in a single polymer , or equivalently the concept of localisation or delocalisation of knots .",
    "a knot is localised when the portion of the chain that it occupies scales with a sublinear power of the total length of the polymer , and delocalised otherwise .",
    "while it is intuitive that stretched knots localise , other results on knot localisation are quite unexpected .",
    "for instance , knots in unconstrained polymers are weakly localised , and they delocalise below the theta temperature .",
    "likewise , knots in bacteriophages appear to delocalise when they are inside the capsid , and this may be at the origin of the seemingly paradoxical observation that dna can be ejected into the bacterial host even when it is highly knotted ( see sections [ dna_capsid ] and [ realknots ] ) .",
    "however , the interplay of knot size with confinement and concentration is poorly understood to date and will certainly attract more researchers in the years to come .    in summary ,",
    "we have provided a survey of the methodology , the current results and the open problems in the physics and topology of confined and concentrated polymers . most of the latest progress in this interdisciplinary area , which covers vital aspects of biophysics and technology , depends on the use of advanced theoretical and especially computational techniques .",
    "these have been covered in detail here with the aim of providing an organised summary of the state - of - the art and an accessible guide for researchers entering in the field .",

    "we recall here the procedure necessary to calculate the distance of minimum approach of two segments with endpoints respectively equal to @xmath744 , @xmath745 and @xmath746 , @xmath747 .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the points on the segments as follows : @xmath748    where @xmath749 and @xmath750 and the parameters @xmath452 and @xmath47 are limited to the [ 0,1 ] range .",
    "the required distance is clearly given by minimizing @xmath751 over the unit square in the @xmath752 plane .",
    "first it is necessary to calculate the values of @xmath452 and @xmath47 which yield the global minimum of @xmath535 : @xmath753    where @xmath754 .",
    "the points associated to @xmath755 and @xmath756 are the points of minimum approach of the infinite lines which contain the two segments .",
    "if @xmath755 and @xmath756 are both in the [ 0,1 ] range then the points of closest approach of the lines fall inside the segments and @xmath757 is clearly the sought inter - segment distance . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath758 falls outside the unit square then the minimum value of @xmath535 must be searched on the perimeter of the unit square .",
    "this requires setting in turn @xmath452 and @xmath47 equal to 0 or 1 and minimizing @xmath759 over the `` free '' parameter restricted to the [ 0,1 ] range .",
    "knot simplification algorithms usually rely on various geometrical manipulations of a ring that do not alter the ring topology .",
    "a ubiquitous simplification operation consists of picking a chain node , @xmath53 , at random and displacing it from the current position , @xmath760 , to a new one , @xmath761 , that is more collinear with the flanking nodes : @xmath762 with @xmath763 $ ] .",
    "it must be checked that during a continuously parametrised movement of the bond from @xmath760 to @xmath764 no chain segment is crossed , as this might alter the topology .    to check the preservation of topology it is necessary to check   that the two triangular faces with vertices @xmath765 and @xmath766 do not intersect any of the chain segments that do not include @xmath767 or @xmath768 as endpoints . for the sake of self - containedness we recall here the procedure for checking whether a segment with endpoints @xmath744",
    ", @xmath745 intersects a triangular face with vertices @xmath769 .",
    "first it is calculated the point of intersection of the face and the infinite line containing the @xmath770 segment and the infinite plane containing the triangular face .",
    "it is convenient to indicate with @xmath771 the normal to the plane containing the triangular face and with @xmath772 the parametrization of the line containing the segment .",
    "the point on the line at the intersection with the plane is identified as @xmath773 where , @xmath774    if the value of @xmath755 falls outside the [ 0,1 ] range ( which parametrizes the @xmath770 segment ) then it means that the segment does not intersect the plane , and hence the face .",
    "however , if @xmath755 is in the [ 0,1 ] range , it is necessary to check if the point of intersection , @xmath775 falls within the face .",
    "to do so it is sufficient to write the vector @xmath776 as a linear combination of the two oriented face edges departing from @xmath777 : @xmath778 the coefficients @xmath422 and @xmath188 are conveniently obtained by solving the two linear equations obtained multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lincomb ] ) by @xmath779 and @xmath780 .",
    "if both @xmath422 and @xmath188 are in the [ 0,1 ] range it means that the point falls inside the triangular face . in this case",
    "the displacement of the bead can not be accomplished without causing the crossing of two chain segments . as the topology",
    "would not be necessarily preserved the bead move must be rejected .",
    "we remark that the above mentioned procedure is used not only in knot simplification contexts , but also in topology - preserving monte carlo evolutions of a given conformation . in this case , the @xmath56 bead is displaced randomly or with a crankshaft ( local ) move and the above criteria are applied . notice that this requires that only a single bead is moved at a time , as the check of topology preservation is not easily generalizable to the case of simultaneous displacement of two beads .",
    "also , this method does not preserve the bond lengths ."
