    "recently @xcite reported on the detection of four classical cepheids clustered in angle ( within one degree ) and distance ( on average 90  kpc from the galactic center ) in a direction near the galactic plane at longitude @xmath0 .",
    "they used near - infrared data from the eso public survey vista variables in the via lactea ( vvv , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their search for periodic variables was based on time - series photometry in the @xmath2 band with only 32 epochs per star across the vvv disk area . for each of the star classified by them as a cepheid they provide single epoch vvv photometry in the @xmath3 bands and extinction values derived from the color excess assuming the @xcite extinction law . finally , they calculate distances to the objects using a formula given in @xcite .",
    "the obtained mean distance of 90 kpc and clumped location in the sky led them to a conclusion that the stars are associated with a previously unknown dwarf galaxy . in our work , we show that to conclude on the presence of such a galaxy one has to be absolutely sure that the observed stars are of particular type and are indeed located at a similar distance behind the galactic disk .",
    "the ogle project in its fourth phase of operation ( ogle - iv , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) conducts , among others , a survey of the galactic disk area visible from las campanas observatory , chile  the ogle galaxy variability survey ( ogle gvs ) .",
    "it covers 2/3 of the galactic plane with longitudes from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and latitudes @xmath6 . regular monitoring with a cadence of 12 days , called the shallow ogle gvs , started in 2013 .",
    "it spans a magnitude range @xmath7 .",

    "however , at the moment of writing ( june 2015 ) sufficient amount of data have been collected to find information on selected galactic plane objects , such as the candidate cepheids reported in @xcite .    for clarity , it is very important to note that in their paper , @xcite made the following errors in ids , coordinates , and finding charts for reported objects , later corrected in private communication with us : ( 1 ) everywhere in their paper the correct i d for the second reported star should be vvv j162231.35 - 512346.9 ( not vvv j162328.18 - 513230.4 ) and thus the galactic coordinates given in their table  1 are also incorrect ; ( 2 ) the finding chart for the second object is wrong , while the @xmath2-band light curve shown in their fig .  1 is correct ; ( 3 ) in the same figure , they labeled the fourth object using the i d of the third one .",

    "if the two objects were indeed cepheids with pulsation periods of 34  d as proposed on the base of the @xmath2-band observations , we would see them in the @xmath1 band as large - amplitude variables ( @xmath21  mag ) .",
    "objects s1 and s2 either are constant stars or have amplitudes of at most a few hundreds of magnitude .",
    "deep ogle gvs observations confirm the variable nature of object s3 with a period around 5.69  d noted in @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum based on the optical data shows a very strong signal at @xmath12  d and also @xmath22  d. the shape of the light curve is close to a sinusoid , but its stability is under question .",
    "it is likely that the @xmath1-band amplitude changed from about 0.35  mag in 2011 to 0.50  mag in 2015 .",
    "the value for 2011 is , however , uncertain , since only eight images were taken that year . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier ] , we show that the optimal fourier fit to the @xmath1-band data is of an maximal order of @xmath14 , assuming @xmath12  d and stability of the light curve . for @xmath14",
    "we obtain the following fourier parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . from this",
    "we find the following combinations : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the case of @xmath11 , we would obtain : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath26 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and hence : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "all above uncertainties were calculated from the standard propagation formula for independent variables .",
    "the combination @xmath18 is the best parameter to distinguish between the fundamental - mode and first - overtone pulsators with periods around 5.7  d ( log@xmath40 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath18 , here very similar for @xmath14 and @xmath11 , is evidently too high for fundamental - mode cepheids at this period ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : steepness ] , we present how fast high - amplitude classical cepheids increase their brightness from minimum to maximum . for stars with periods between 2 and 7",
    "d it takes about 20% of the period , in contrast to 40% in s3 .",
    "the close - to - sinusoidal light curve shape of s3 , or the @xmath18 value of @xmath41 , could indicate a first - overtone cepheid , but @xmath1-band amplitudes as high as 0.5  mag are not observed at long periods in this type of pulsators ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pamp ] ) .",
    "moreover , longest observed periods in first - overtone cepheids tend to shorten with metallicity .",
    "for instance , periods in this type of cepheids from the large magellanic cloud are not longer than 5.9  d @xcite , while from more metal - poor small magellanic cloud are not even longer than 4.5  d @xcite . in none of known environments , @xmath1-band amplitudes of the first - overtone cepheids with periods @xmath42",
    "d exceed 0.35  mag .",
    "a dwarf galaxy is expected to host old and metal - poor stars , such as rr lyrae type variables and anomalous cepheids rather than classical ones .    on the other hand , amplitudes of 0.5  mag or higher",
    "are observed in numerous chromospherically active stars , such as of rs cvn type . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spotted ] , we show three examples of spotted stars with periods of a few days found in the ogle database",
    ". light curves of such stars change slowly over years and very often may mimick pulsations and eclipses if observed for a short period of time . based on the observed properties of the light curve",
    ", we conclude that object s3 is very likely a spotted star with the period of 5.695  d , but the period of 11.390  d can not be excluded .",
    "see comparison of the fourier combinations for s3 and spotted stars in fig .",
    "[ fig : s3spotted ] .",
    "object s4 , which is too faint to be detected in the deep ogle gvs images , according to @xcite has a period of 13.9  d and a skewed @xmath2-band light curve with the rising part about twice longer than the fading one .",
    "such a shape is not observed in classical cepheids .",
    "@xcite normalized near - ir photometry for 30 galactic and 31 lmc fundamental - mode cepheids with periods mostly longer than 10  d and showed that their @xmath43-band light curves are very homogeneous and nearly symmetric .",
    "@xcite performed a global model for 287 classical cepheids with @xmath44  d based on thousands of multiband observations . according to their work @xmath43-band light curves of stars with periods of 1314  d",
    "have the rise and fall time scales equal .",
    "@xmath43-band light curves of long - period classical cepheids presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are practically symmetric and none of them shows the rising branch twice longer then the fading one . some of the presented light curves have a small number of points in @xmath43 and their scatter is comparable with the amplitude , like ogle - lmc - cep-2562 in @xcite and s4 here .",
    "our observations show that none of the three vista objects detected in the ogle gvs data is a classical cepheid .",
    "objects s1 and s2 do not look to be variable at all .",
    "object s3 is indeed variable , but it has a nearly sinusoidal light curve with a high amplitude of 0.5  mag in the @xmath1 band , likely not stable in time .",
    "this is not observed in classical cepheids in any environment .",
    "s3 is very likely a spotted star of rs cvn type .",
    "although we are not able to detect star s4 , its @xmath2-band light curve with @xmath45  d and the twice longer rising part than the fading one would be very unusual for a fundamental - mode classical cepheid . based on the above findings we conclude that there is no evidence for the presence of a dwarf galaxy behind the galactic disk in the observed direction .",
