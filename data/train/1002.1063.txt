    "a brief outline of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "the proof of theorem [ uncountable ] begins in section [ sec : local arbiters ] with the introduction of a dyadic collection of `` model '' submanifolds of @xmath65 ( i.e. a special collection of submanifolds , parametrized by vertices of a trivalent tree . )",

    "one then extends these arbiters to @xmath76 , concluding the proof of theorem [ uncountable ] , see section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "section [ sec : embeddings ] points out that the embeddings of the submanifolds @xmath77 in definition [ def : arbiter ] of arbiters play a very important role .",
    "the result of @xcite shows that if one considers topological arbiters as invariants of manifolds , disregarding their embedding information , then in the context of @xmath65 whenever the attaching circle of @xmath78 is trivial in @xmath79 the value of any arbiter on @xmath13 has to be @xmath3 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ uncountable ] is valid only when the embedding data is taken into account .",
    "indeed the arbiters constructed in its proof assume value @xmath3 on manifolds where the attaching circle does not vanish in homology with any coefficients .",
    "section [ sec : cp2 ] adapts the local construction in the proof of theorem [ uncountable ] to the setting of @xmath80 .",
