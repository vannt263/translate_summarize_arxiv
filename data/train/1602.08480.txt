    "the family of layered organic superconductors @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x ( hereafter @xmath0-(et ) ) has attracted strong interest because of its apparent similarity with the high t@xmath7 cuprates . as in the cuprates , superconductivity ( sc ) in @xmath0-et",
    "is proximate to semiconducting magnetic states , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) or quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) @xcite .",
    "sc in the @xmath0-(et)@xmath1x as well as organic charge - transfer solids ( cts ) in general is however reached by application of pressure rather than doping with charge carriers @xcite .",
    "thus sc is a consequence of change of one or more parameters in the hamiltonian that describes both the semiconducting and superconducting states , at fixed carrier concentration .",
    "the @xmath0-et lattice is strongly dimerized , with strong intradimer electron hoppings between et molecules belonging to the same dimer , and relatively weaker interdimer hoppings ( see fig .  [ fig - lattice ] ) .",
    "complete ct of one electron to the acceptor molecule x occurs from each dimer , which creates cations et@xmath8 with 0.5 holes ( 1.5 electrons ) in the highest occupied molecular orbital ( mo ) of each et molecule .",
    "the dimer lattice is anisotropic triangular , and the magnetic behavior of the family can be understood within an _ effective _ @xmath9-filled band hubbard model , wherein the dimers et@xmath10 of the et molecules ( rather than the molecules themselves ) constitute the individual sites @xcite .",
    "afm in the strongly anisotropic x = cu[n(cn)@xmath1]cl ( hereafter @xmath0-cl ) , and qsl behavior in the nearly isotropic x = cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath3 ( hereafter @xmath0-cn ) are both expected within the effective model @xcite .    in the context of the cuprates",
    ", there exists a large body of theoretical literature claiming that sc occurs within the hubbard model @xcite for bandfilling slightly away from @xmath9 but no consensus has yet been reached on this matter . in analogy to these theories , mean - field and dynamic mean - field theories of @xmath0-(et)@xmath1x have proposed that sc also occurs within the exactly @xmath9-filled band hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice , for a range of hubbard @xmath11 and anisotropy @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for sc within any interacting electrons model however is that interactions must enhance superconducting pair - pair correlations relative to the noninteracting model .",
    "precise numerical calculations within the @xmath9-filled band hubbard model on triangular lattices have shown that pair - pair correlations decrease with hubbard @xmath11 for all anisotropy @xcite , thus indicating the need for going beyond the effective 1/2-filled band model in our search for the the mechanism of sc in @xmath0-(et)@xmath1x .",
    "recently an ubiquitous charge - ordered ( co ) phase of unknown origin has been discovered in the cuprates that competes with both afm and sc @xcite .",
    "the co and sc orders have similar energy scales , and some investigators have suggested that `` co and sc appear as joint instabilities of the same normal state '' @xcite .",
    "given that sc proximate to co is also seen in ( et)@xmath1x with crystal structures different from @xmath0 @xcite , it is natural to ask whether the mechanisms of sc in all ( et)@xmath1x are actually related , and whether even in the @xmath0-et family there exists a hidden competing co state .",
    "uniquely for the case of carrier density precisely 0.5 or 1.5 per site , we have shown that there can indeed occur a _",
    "spin - paired _ co state , a paired - electron crystal ( pec ) , in frustrated lattices @xcite .",
    "the pec is a wigner crystal of spin - bonded pairs , rather than of single electrons @xcite . in the @xmath0 materials ,",
    "the pec would require _ unequal charge densities _ on the monomer molecules that constitute each et dimer , with _",
    "inter_dimer spin - pairing between monomers with large charge densities @xcite .",
    "other groups have also proposed related theories of fluctuating intradimer charge disproportionation @xcite , in order to explain the peculiar dielectric responses of @xmath0-cn @xcite and @xmath0-cl @xcite . while recent experiments have shown the absence of static co in both materials @xcite , and ascribe the electrodynamic response of @xmath0-cn to coupling of et cations to anions @xcite , dynamic fluctuating co is not precluded @xcite .",
    "such a fluctuating co may perhaps explain the low temperature `` 6 k transition '' in @xmath0-cn that remains unexplained @xcite .",
    "experimentally , static pec has been observed in the @xmath0 compound x = hg(scn)@xmath1cl @xcite , while pressure - induced transition from a dimer afm to an intradimer charge segregated state has been observed in the compound @xmath12-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1-icl@xmath1 @xcite , which like @xmath0-(et ) has a dimerized lattice structure .",
    "we have recently proposed that sc in the ( et)@xmath1x evolves from a _ paired - electron liquid _",
    "( pel ) , which can be thought of as a destabilized pec @xcite ( thus a static pec is not a requirement for the pel or sc . ) our conclusion is based on precise numerical calculations of pair - pair correlations within the hubbard model on anisotropic triangular lattices , for variable carrier densities @xmath4 per site .",
    "we showed that in each case the pair - pair correlations are enhanced relative to the noninteracting limit uniquely for @xmath13 . at all other @xmath4 ( @xmath14 )",
    "pair - pair correlations are suppressed by the hubbard @xmath11 .",
    "although the pel does not have true long - range superconducting correlations , to the best of our knowledge this was the first demonstration of enhancement of pair - pair correlations within the hubbard model .",
    "the fundamental theoretical picture that emerges is related to an earlier proposition that sc can evolve from the paired wigner crystal in the electron gas at intermediate densities , upon weak doping @xcite .",
    "our work has extended this idea of evolution from a a paired crystal to a paired liquid to the case of a real lattice .",
    "both paired states on the lattice are however unique to a particular carrier density .",
    "the anisotropic triangular lattice lacks the strong dimerization of @xmath0 lattice , and the possibility of mapping to the effective @xmath15 model @xcite thus does not exist in this case . whether or not coulomb - induced enhancement of pair - pair correlations occurs in the _ realistic _ @xmath0 lattice , _ also uniquely for the same carrier concentration @xmath4 , _ as well as the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter , if any , are of strong interest .",

    ", we perform these calculations for variable @xmath4 .",
    "we demonstrate pel formation on the @xmath0 lattices uniquely at or near @xmath16 filling with electrons , giving further credence to our proposal@xcite that there occurs an effective electron - electron ( e - e ) attraction selectively at this @xmath4 .",
    "the majority of computational studies of correlated models for @xmath0-et have focused on the effective @xmath9-filled band model . for the monomer lattice",
    "exact diagonalizations within 16-site clusters within the hubbard and extended hubbard models have been performed @xcite , as well as dynamical mean - field ( dmft ) studies @xcite to our knowledge , the present results report the first direct calculations of pair - pair correlations on large lattices .",
    "system sizes available to exact diagonalization are able to demonstrate spin correlations consistent with afm order between dimers , but are not large enough for measurement of pair - pair correlations between non - overlapping pairs .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec - lattice ] we describe the theoretical model , the lattices and the computational methods we use ; in section [ sec - results ] we present our computational results for the spin structure factor and pair - pair correlations in the ground state ; and in section [ sec - discussion ] we discuss our results in relationship to the current experimental data on @xmath0-et , as well as implications for theories of correlated - electron sc in general .",

    "the motivation behind studying the density dependence of pair - pair correlations is two - fold .",
    "first , this allows us to investigate whether or not sc is unique to @xmath24 , which is a necessary condition if the sc is indeed evolving from a hidden pec @xcite .",
    "secondly , it also allows us to probe carrier density slightly away from the stoichiometric @xmath6 in view of recent experiments@xcite that have suggested that sc can occur in the @xmath0-et system for weak doping away from @xmath6 .",
    "hopping integrals for @xmath0-et have been previously calculated using the extended hckel @xcite and density - functional methods @xcite .",
    "each molecule in the lattice has significant overlaps with six nearest neighbors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - lattice ] ) with hopping integrals @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in order of decreasing magnitude . in the effective dimer model the two molecules connected by @xmath25 are considered a single effective site , with the dimers forming an anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "the effective hopping integrals along @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 and the frustrating hopping integral @xmath32 .",
    "the degree of frustration in the effective dimer model is then given by the ratio @xmath33 .",
    "frustration is weakest in @xmath0-cl and strongest in @xmath0-cn ; these are the systems we consider .    in our calculations",
    "we have used the following sets of @xmath34 , ( @xmath25 , @xmath35 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , given in mev , from reference : for @xmath0-cl ( 207 , 67 , -102 , -43 ) , and for @xmath0-cn ( 199 , 91 , -85 , -17 ) .",
    "both sets were determined@xcite from low - temperature crystal data , @xmath36=5 k in the case of @xmath0-cn , and @xmath36=15 k in the case of @xmath0-cl .",
    "for these two sets of parameters , the ratio @xmath37 is 0.46 ( 0.89 ) for @xmath0-cl ( @xmath0-cn ) .",
    "while different computational techniques report somewhat different @xmath37 , all have found that in terms of the effective dimer model @xmath0-cn is significantly more frustrated and closer to an isotropic triangular dimer lattice than is @xmath0-cl .",
    "it is however not known how the effect of the larger frustration within the dimer model affects the electronic properties of the full monomer lattice .",
    "we considered two different periodic lattices with 32 and 64 molecular sites .",
    "the 32 site lattice is four dimers each along the * c * and * a * directions in fig .",
    "[ fig - lattice ] .",
    "the lattice is chosen such that the effective dimer lattice ( along the * x * and * y * axes of fig .",

    "this is possible if the vectors defining the edges of the 32 site cluster are along the * c * and * y * directions in fig .",
    "[ fig - lattice ] .",
    "the 64 site cluster was constructed in a similar way and corresponds to an 8@xmath384 lattice in terms of dimers .",
    "the full lattices are shown in the supplemental material @xcite . on both lattices , the @xmath34 parameters @xcite for @xmath0-cl and @xmath0-cn gave different single - particle fermi level degeneracies ;",
    "the degeneracy for @xmath6 is twofold in @xmath0-cl and fourfold in @xmath0-cn , in agreement with the greater frustration in the latter .",
    "conventional quantum monte carlo methods can not be used in the highly frustrated @xmath0-et lattice due to the fermion sign problem .",
    "the two methods we used are the path integral renormalization group ( pirg ) @xcite and constrained path monte carlo ( cpmc ) @xcite .",
    "both pirg and cpmc are ground state projector methods that project out the ground state from an arbitrary initial wavefunction . in pirg",
    "the projection is done in a finite basis of slater determinants , followed by an extrapolation in the energy variance @xcite . in cpmc",
    "the projection is done using random walkers constrained by a trial wavefunction @xcite .",
    "here we have used the @xmath39 wavefunction for the constraint .",
    "we have extensively benchmarked calculations of superconducting pair - pair between these two methods in previous work on the anisotropic triangular hubbard model both at @xmath9-filling @xcite as well as the complete density range @xcite .",
    "while pirg can be considered exact provided large enough basis sets are used and the projection is done with care , the constraining wavefunction in cpmc does introduce a systematic error . in our previous work , we found that cpmc results for pairing correlations agreed well with pirg for small to intermediate @xmath11 , provided use of cpmc was restricted to systems which in the noninteracting @xmath39 limit have nondegenerate closed - shell fermi level occupancies @xcite .",
    "we performed pirg calculations for the 32-site lattice over the full density range @xmath40 and for @xmath6 for the 64-site lattice .",
    "for the other densities of the 64 site lattice with nondegenerate fermi level occupancies we performed cpmc calculations .",
    "we used the full set of spatial symmetries within the symmetrized version of pirg ( qp - pirg ) , which has been shown to significantly improve the results compared to earlier pirg calculations @xcite .",
    "the symmetries we used for the 32 site lattice were translations , a @xmath41 rotation , and a glide - plane symmetry .",
    "we also projected out the even spin parity state .",
    "the pirg basis size was up to @xmath42=512 slater determinants for 32 sites and @xmath42=768 for 64 sites .",
    "afm is best explained within the effective dimer model @xcite , where the charge densities on the molecules of the dimer are equal .",

    "we do not have access to large enough system sizes to perform a finite - size scaling for @xmath51 , but the decrease of @xmath53 with increasing system size indicates that our @xmath0-cl results are consistent with a metallic state with afm _ correlations _ rather than an afm insulating state ( @xmath54 should scale to a non - zero value in the presence of long - range afm order at @xmath55 in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "we discuss this issue further in section [ sec - discussion ] .",
    "for the 64 site @xmath0-cn lattice , we find that the variation @xmath51 with * q * is _ less _ than for 32 sites ; this behavior is consistent with lack of magnetic order in the mott insulating state of @xmath0-cn .",

    "experimentally , @xmath0-cl and deuterated @xmath0-br are the only compounds that exhibit afm @xcite , and all other compounds are either ambient pressure superconductors ( @xmath0-br @xcite and @xmath0-ncs @xcite ) , qsl ( @xmath0-cn @xcite ) or pec ( @xmath0-hg(scn)@xmath1cl @xcite ) .",

    "charge - ordering in the last group of materials is accompanied by spin - singlet formation and is apparently driven by strong interdimer coupling @xcite , which is also the condition for pec formation @xcite . taken together , these results suggest that even as afm spin - spin correlations in @xmath0-et are significant , these systems are at the threshold of transitions to proximate broken symmetries that include the pec as well as sc . this observation is reminiscent of the occurrence of a co phase competing with both afm and sc in the cuprates@xcite , mentioned in section [ sec - introduction ] .",
    "we speculate that the origin of long range afm is due to either the nearest neighbor coulomb interaction @xmath81 , or the coupling between et@xmath82 cations and anions , both of which have been ignored in our calculations . because of the triangular dimer lattice , interdimer coulomb interactions are nearly the same in all directions and the consequence of interdimer @xmath81 is small ; conversely , intradimer @xmath81 promotes single electron occupancy of dimers , and enhances afm .",

    "our most significant result is the calculated enhancement of pair - pair correlations by hubbard @xmath11 within a narrow electron density range about @xmath6 .",
    "enhanced pair - pair correlations is a necessary though not sufficient condition for sc .",

    "_ this is particularly so considering the relevance of this carrier density to experimental ( et)@xmath1x .",
    "within our theory , afm is a signature of strong correlations , but is not the driver of electron pairing .",
    "enhanced pair - pair correlations originate from the strong tendency to spin - singlet coupling at @xmath83 and 1.5 , both because of the existence of a commensurate pec at these densities @xcite , and because the stabilization due to the kinetic energy gain from pair motion is highest at these carrier concentrations .",
    "consideration of nearest neighbor spin - bonded sites as effective `` negative u '' centers has a long history , especially in the context of bipolaron theories of sc @xcite .",
    "such a `` mapping '' for @xmath4 exactly 0.5 or 1.5 leads to an effective @xmath9-filled band of bosons @xcite , with nearly degenerate co and sc .",
    "we emphasize that the effective `` negative u '' model is different from the existing effective @xmath9-filled band theories emphasizing afm @xcite , within which no co phase is anticipated .",
    "thus within our theory , sc proximate to afm ( as occurs in the @xmath0-(et)@xmath1x ) , as well as to co ( as occurs in other crystal structures or in the anionic superconductors @xcite ) are _ manifestations of the same correlation effects and to be anticipated_. of course , the co in these cases should have the charge pattern of the pec ( as opposed to the wigner crystal ) with ground state spin singlet character .",
    "our work indicates that while repulsive e - e interactions can drive the transition to a pel with short range pair - pair correlations at @xmath84 , additional interactions missing in the purely electronic hubbard model will be necessary to obtain long - range superconducting correlations .",
    "the most likely such interactions are that between the electrons and lattice vibrations involving intramolecular holstein phonons @xcite and intermolecular su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) phonons @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that there are many counterexamples to the notions that e - e and electron - phonon ( e - p ) interactions invariably negate each others effects and that e - p coupling can only generate sc of @xmath65-wave symmetry .",
    "one widely known counterexample is the enhancement of the e - p interaction driven peierls bond - alternation in the one - dimensional half - filled band by e - e interactions @xcite . with the holstein - type e - p coupling ,",
    "integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom leads to an effective negative @xmath11 interaction giving onsite cdw order or @xmath65-wave sc @xcite .",
    "however , for the 2d dispersionless ssh model , integrating out the phonons leads to an attractive term proportional to the square of the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "this term mediates @xmath62 sc and competes with afm mediated by @xmath11 at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we have similarly found co - operative interactions between the effects of e - e and e - p interactions in the formation of the pec in both 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the retarded phonon interactions can be thought as `` following '' the instantaneous correlations driven by the e - e interactions .",
    "thus the interpretation of our result that the pel is unique to @xmath85 should be that in the presence of e - p interactions this is the carrier density in the @xmath0 lattice where correlated - electron sc is most likely .",
    "the idea that afm coupling may be driving the formation of nearest neighbor cooper pairs , whose mobility is then enhanced by e - p interactions has also been proposed within later versions of the bipolaron theory of sc @xcite .",
    "these calculations are for only two electrons on a lattice .",
    "the significant advancement reached in our work is that we have demonstrated here the formation of similar mobile bipolarons within the electron - only hamiltonian for the full many - electron system as opposed to one with only two electrons .",
    "experiments using a wide range of probes suggest that the sc pairing throughout the @xmath0-(et)@xmath1x family is singlet with nodes in the order parameter .",
    "site - selective @xmath86c nmr experiments have been performed on the ambient - pressure superconductors @xmath0-br @xcite @xmath0-ncs @xcite , and also for @xmath0-cn under pressure in its superconducting state @xcite .",
    "common features found from the nmr experiments include singlet pairing , no coherence peak in 1/@xmath87 , and 1/@xmath88 at low temperatures .",
    "these suggest a non - bcs mechanism and the presence of nodes .",
    "in contrast to early specific heat measurements that supported @xmath65-wave pairing @xcite , more recent measurements are consistent with a nodal order parameter @xcite .",
    "microwave penetration depth measurements @xcite as well as stm tunneling experiments @xcite are also consistent with nodes .",
    "while experiments are generally in agreement that the sc is singlet and has a nodal order parameter , there is less agreement on the specific form of the order parameter and the location of nodes in the conducting plane .",
    "candidate symmetries @xmath62 and @xmath89 differ in the locations of their nodes ; in the experimental literature @xmath62 symmetry is usually assumed to have nodes at 45@xmath90 to the crystal axes , while @xmath89 has nodes along the crystal axes .",
    "it is important to note that in theoretical work based on the effective half - filled model , these two symmetries are interchanged , as the effective @xmath29 and @xmath30 axes are _ rotated _ with respect to the crystal axes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - lattice ] ) . magneto - optical @xcite and specific heat measurements in a magnetic field",
    "find the nodes to coincide with the crystal axes @xcite .",
    "thermal conductivity @xcite and stm measurements @xcite however find the nodes between the crystal axes , although stm measurements on a partially deuterated @xmath0-br suggest a mixture of two order parameters @xcite .",
    "experiments sensitive to the position of the nodes have not been performed on @xmath0-cn , which is superconducting only under pressure .    in our calculations ( see fig .  [ symmetry ] ) , the @xmath63 symmetry has nodes along the crystal axes , while the @xmath73 symmetry instead has nodes at an angle between the crystal axes .",
    "the @xmath91 and @xmath92 have one node along a crystal axis and one off - axis . in our results we found the strongest enhancement for the symmetry @xmath73 , which is also the only symmetry with enhanced pairing for both @xmath0-cl and @xmath0-cn",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig - pbar - cl ] shows that several pairing symmetries are enhanced for @xmath0-cl , suggesting the possibility that the optimum pairing symmetry may vary for different x in the @xmath0-et series .",
    "to summarize , from numerical calculations on the hubbard model on the monomer lattice of @xmath0-(et)@xmath1x solids we have found a pel state with enhanced superconducting pair - pair correlations exactly for the cationic charge where sc is found experimentally .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the pair - pair correlations are suppressed by the hubbard interaction at all other carrier densities .",
    "the superconducting order we find is short - range , and considerable work involving both e - e and e - p interactions will be necessary before a complete theory of sc in the cts is reached . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "however , robust coulomb enhancement of pair correlations has not been found before . taken together with our previous work @xcite ,",
    "this gives us confidence that the physical ideas behind this work , viz .",
    ", ( i ) enhancement of superconducting pair correlations requires a proximate spin - singlet state in the phase diagram , and ( ii ) such a spin - singlet is strongly stabilized in 2d for @xmath83 or 1.5 , are fundamentally correct .",
    "the spin - singlet state in our case has a strong tendency to form a co. as pointed out earlier , co proximate to sc has been found within the pseudogap phase of the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "we are currently investigating the implication of our results for the cuprates .",
    "s. m. and r. t. c. acknowledge very useful discussions with m. dressel and s. tomic , and for sending them preprints of references and .",
