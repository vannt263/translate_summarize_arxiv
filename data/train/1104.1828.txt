    "over the past decade , we have learned that all large galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone et al .  1995 ;",
    "richstone et al .",
    "material falling onto black holes forms a rapidly spinning disk which heats up and radiates the light we see as quasars and other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , salpeter  1964 ; zeldovich & novikov  1964 ; lynden bell  1969 ) .",
    "the masses of these black holes can be measured through different techniques . in galaxies with a dormant black hole",
    ", the bh mass can be measured through the velocity dispersion of stars or gas close enough to the bh which their dynamics are dominated by bh gravity ( within the radius of influence ; e.g. , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt  2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "however , this method can not be used for active nuclei where the nucleus outshines the core of the host galaxy ( e.g. , richstone et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt  2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "thus , alternative mass measurement methods are necessary , but are agn type dependent ( blandford & mckee  1982 ; peterson  1993 ; miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) . in nearly edge - on ( type 2 ) agns , mass can be measured from water masers located in the outer accretion disk ( miyoshi et al .",
    "however , water masers can not be used widely due to the extreme edge - on alignment needed for radiation to be sufficiently amplified . in more face - on ( type 1 ) agns , one can instead use reverberation mapping when variations of the broad emission lines relative to the continuum are present ( e.g. , koratkar & gaskell  1991 ; kaspi et al .",

    "reverberation mapping ( rm ) studies ( blandford & mckee  1982 ; peterson  1993 ) take advantage of long monitoring campaigns of agns to infer properties of the broad line emitting region ( blr ) through characterization of time delays ( @xmath1 ) between broad emission line and continuum flux variations ( e.g. , koratkar & gaskell  1991 ; kaspi et al .  2000 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ; bentz et al .  2006 ; bentz  2009 ) . in principle , rm can generate a velocity - delay map ( revealing kinematic structure in the blr ) which can help one to estimate the black hole mass independent of other methods ( see done & krolik  1996 ; ulrich & horne  1996 ; kollatschny  2003 ; horne et al .",
    "2004 ; denney et al .  2009 ; bentz et al .",
    "however , at the moment , one still has to calibrate quasar black hole masses to nearby well studied dormant black holes ( assuming that they are descendants of the active bhs ; see , e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; krolik  2001 ; mclure & dunlop  2001 ; onken et al .  2004 ) .",
    "it has taken many years of rm campaigns to obtain a large sample of such mass measurements even for a handful of low redshift quasars ( e.g. , done & krolik  1996 ; ulrich & horne  1996 ; kollatschny  2003 ; peterson  2006 ; bentz et al .  2009 ; denney et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the rm results show an empirical correlation between the distance of the blr from the bh ( which is the measured time - lag @xmath1 times the speed of light ) and a monochromatic continuum luminosity ( known as @xmath2 or @xmath3 correlation ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; bentz et al .",
    "this @xmath2 correlation simplifies the mass measurement since determining the radius of the blr using long monitoring campaigns can be replaced by measuring the monochromatic continuum luminosity from a single epoch spectrum .",
    "the rm results also show a relationship between emission line widths ( @xmath4 ) and corresponding time - lags ( e.g. , peterson & wandel  1999 , 2000 ; onken & peterson  2002 ; kollatschny  2002 ) which confirms the virialization of the blr .",
    "this relationship enables a secondary method of bh mass determination from @xmath5 if one assumes that the @xmath4 of a virialized emission line ( e.g. , h@xmath0 ) reflects the virialized bulk motion of the emitting gas ( e.g. , peterson & wandel  1999 , 2000 ; onken & peterson  2002 ; kollatschny  2003 ) . by measuring the line width of a particular line ( using the fwhm or the line dispersion ) and the luminosity of the agn at a particular wavelength",
    ", one can calibrate the virial mass equation of the secondary method for a sample of rm black hole masses .",
    "that equation can then be used to estimate unknown quasar bh masses ( e.g. , wandel et al .",

    "h@xmath0  can be identified in low redshift quasars ( @xmath6 ) with observations from ground - based telescopes in the optical or near infrared , while the civ  emission line can be identified in high redshift quasars ( @xmath7 ) in those bands .",
    "thus , h@xmath0  provides well calibrated masses but can not be seen in the most distant black holes with ground based telescopes , while civ  can be seen but could be strongly contaminated by non - gravitational motions .",
    "for example , the peak of the civ  emission line is usually blueshifted , probably implying an outflow of material ( e.g. , leighly et al .",

    "we have assembled a catalogue of black hole mass estimates using the 2798    doublet of singly ionized magnesium ( mgii ) , which can be observed by ground - based telescopes in the optical or near infrared for even the most distant quasars and which is thought to probe largely the same region of the accretion disk as h@xmath0  ( mclure & jarvis  2002 ; but see wang et al .",
    "although there is no rm study which demonstrates the virialization of the mgii  emission line , bh mass estimates using mgii  show consistency with similar estimates using h@xmath0  ( mclure & jarvis  2002 ) , which is considered a virialized line ( peterson & wandel  1999 ) .    for our mass estimates , we use the line dispersion of the line profile instead of fwhm since the relation between rms line dispersion and rm time - delay appears to be less scattered than the same relation with rms fwhm , at least for the h@xmath0  line ( peterson et al .",
    "the line dispersion uses the data directly but is sensitive to the wings of the line profile ( collin et al .",
    "the fwhm is the fwhm of a fit of one or more gaussians to the line profile ( e.g , mclure & dunlop  2004 ; shen et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the fwhm of a single gaussian fit in particular may be a poor representation of the true fwhm of a line .",
    "furthermore , it is not confirmed that the mgii  fwhm is linearly related to the rms fwhm of h@xmath0  ( wang et al .",
    "shen et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have provided a bh mass catalogue with mass estimates made using the fwhms of mgii , h@xmath0  and civ .",
    "however , they have not calibrated the mgii  scaling relation but instead have adopted the mclure & dunlop  ( 2004 ) relationship , despite there being many updated rm mass measurements since 2004 .",
    "onken & kollmeier  ( 2008 ) have shown that the shen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) mgii  mass estimates are eddington ratio dependent , which may indicate a problem with fwhm - based mgii  mass estimates .",
    "we are therefore motivated to test the alternative , the line dispersion of mgii .    to reduce the uncertainties in the line dispersion due to low signal - to - noise ratio spectra and the sensitivity of the technique to the line wings",

    "we describe how we select our data sample from the sdss . in  5 , we explain how we reduce the noise level by reconstructing the sdss quasar spectra using pca . in  6 , we study the effect of the radiation pressure on bh mass estimates and calibrate a new mass scaling relation for that scenario . in  7 , we simulate the effects of noise in reconstructed spectra to understand the biases on bh mass estimates before and after reconstruction . in  8",
    ", we use the mass scaling relations to estimate the bh masses of sdss quasars and present our bh mass catalogue .",
    "we then compare our bh mass estimates with shen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in  9 , we present our conclusions .    in this study",
    "we assume a lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath8 ) cosmology with hubble constant @xmath9 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , fractional dark energy density @xmath11 and fractional matter energy density @xmath12 ( spergel et al .",

    "the observed line width , @xmath4 , and the continuum luminosity can both be estimated from a single epoch spectrum .",
    "the average geometrical factor @xmath15 will remain as a free parameter to be adjusted such that it makes these secondary mass estimates most consistent with the virial mass estimates .",
    "the virial masses are in turn calibrated to direct mass measurements of nearby inactive black holes through the bh mass - bulge velocity dispersion ( ) relationship ( e.g. , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt  2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "this calibration is valuable since there is no direct way to estimate the mass zero point for the quasar bh mass relationship , but it does assume that the same relationship is valid for quasars and for inactive bhs .      the traditional way to measure",
    "the line width is to measure its .",
    "this is simple for single peaked lines and more complex for multiple - peaked lines or noisy data ( for double - peaked lines , there is a complete discussion in peterson et al .",
    "the line dispersion , which can be calculated without making any assumption about the line profile , can be defined by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the @xmath19 & @xmath20 moments of the emission line profile @xmath21 : @xmath22 the second moment is more sensitive to blending with other lines or extended wings than the fwhm , but less sensitive to the presence of even strong narrow - line components .",
    "the fwhm versus time lag plots for emission lines show dramatic scatter ( especially for h@xmath0 ) when using the mean spectra ( which are more similar to single epoch spectra than rms spectra are ) , while the line dispersion , @xmath23 , versus time lag plots show less scatter ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "on the other hand , studies of rm samples have shown that agns with line dispersion , @xmath23 , lower than 2000  have @xmath24 while agns with @xmath25  have @xmath26 ( sulentic et al .",

    "this result clearly indicates the non - gaussianity of line profiles for quasar emission lines . thus using the fwhm as a line width indicator may overestimate the bh masses for the broadest emission lines and underestimate the bh masses for the narrowest emission lines as compared to bh mass estimates using the line dispersion .",
    "the true line dispersion can be determined through considering the instrumental resolution and writing the observed line width in terms of the intrinsic line dispersion , @xmath31 and the spectrograph s instrumental line profile , @xmath32 : @xmath33 where the instrumental dispersion is observed - frame while the other two are rest - frame .",

    "we now evaluate the statistical errors on bh mass estimates from reconstructed spectra due to the presence of different noise levels in quasar spectra before reconstruction .",
    "we select 100 quasars with the highest signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , from 20 to 50 .",
    "then we add randomly generated gaussian noise to these spectra to decrease the snr to 1/2 , 1/4 , 1/8 , and 1/16 of the original snr ( see figure [ fig : noise_added_spectra ] ) .",
    "we repeat this process for each new snr 6 more times to have at least 25 realizations for every spectrum , yielding 2500 spectra in total .",
    "we extract quantities like @xmath124 and @xmath47 ( see section [ sec : measuring line width ] and [ sec : fm ] ) and for four different cases ; before or after reconstructing the spectra by applying pca and before or after applying the radiation pressure correction ( rpc ) .",
    "figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh ] shows , as a function of the average snr in the @xmath125 band , the differences in the logarithms of the black hole mass estimated after adding noise to spectra ( @xmath126 ) and the mass estimated using original spectra with high snr ( @xmath127 ) for four scenarios . as we can see from these figures , the lower the snr , the more the bh mass is uncertain with respect to the high snr mass estimate .",
    "comparing figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]a with figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]b shows an improvement in removing the systematic underestimation of bh masses when the spectra are reconstructed using pca . comparing figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]a with figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]c shows a cutoff on the lower side of the mass estimates in figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]c .",
    "this lower limit is due to the asymptote approached when the estimated line dispersion is very small ( @xmath121 ) in the scenario when the rpc is applied .",
    "there were also three objects out of 100 selected with high snr for which the results are catastrophic .",
    "one object is not being reconstructed properly due to an error on the redshift estimate , and two objects have a broad absorption line right in the mgii  window .",
    "setting aside the 3% catastrophic errors , the scatter is normally distributed around zero when pca reconstruction is applied ( see , e.g. , figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]b and [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]d ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]a , if there was no snr dependency then we would expect a gaussian distribution around zero .",
    "the negative trend in mass difference in low snr level shows the high sensitivity of the method to the snr . in figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]c , the non - symmetrical trend in low snr emphasizes the snr dependency too .",
    "this implies that using second moment of the line profile to estimate the @xmath23 without pca reconstruction is unbiased only for spectra with the very high snr ( @xmath128 ) while after pca reconstruction there is no such systematic bias with the snr , making the pca reconstruction a necessary step in precise estimation of bh mass algorithm .",
    "comparing the mass estimates from these different cases we can conclude that : using pca improves the mass estimation scatter to better than 0.4 dex for snr as low as 1.5 or to better than 0.2 dex for snr of 18 ( see figures [ fig:4histogram_ab_rpc]a and [ fig:4histogram_ab_rpc]b ) .",
    "this improvement is due to the sensitivity of the feii  modeling process and the second moment measurement to both the snr and the accuracy of the power - law estimates for quasar spectra .",
    "using pca along with considering the effect of the radiation pressure improves the mass estimation scatter to better than 0.2 dex for snr of around 1.5 ( see figures [ fig:4histogram_ab_rpc]c and [ fig:4histogram_ab_rpc]d ) .",
    "overall , bh mass estimates are around 50% less scattered for either high or low snr if we consider the effect of the radiation pressure ( compare figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]b to [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]d ) .",
    "however , bh masses are around 3 to 4 times less scattered in the high snr regime than in the low snr regime , either before ( figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]b ) or after the radiation correction ( figure [ fig:4in1_log_diff_mbh]d ) , but only if we reconstruct the spectra .",
    "denney et al .  ( 2009 ) have studied the effect of the snr on reverberation bh mass estimates using both fwhm and line dispersion of quasar ngc  5548 .",
    "they have reported a similar dependency on snr as we see before reconstructing the spectra .",
    "here we present a catalogue including black hole mass estimates for three scenarios : black hole masses before applying pca and before rpc ( @xmath129 ; see , e.g. , figure [ fig:3in1_mbh_z]a ) , bh masses after applying pca but before rpc ( @xmath130 ; see , e.g. , figures [ fig:3in1_mbh_z]b ) , and bh masses after applying pca and after rpc ( @xmath131 ; see , e.g. , figures [ fig:3in1_mbh_z]c ) .",

    "<S> we present mgii  -based black hole mass estimates for 27,602 quasars with rest - frame uv spectra available in the sloan digital sky survey data release three . </S>",
    "<S> this estimation is possible due to the existence of an empirical correlation between the radius of the broad line region and the continuum luminosity at 3000 angstroms . </S>",
    "<S> we regenerate this correlation by applying our measurement method to uv spectra of low - redshift quasars in the hst / iue databases which have corresponding reverberation mapping estimates of the h@xmath0  broad line region s radius . </S>",
    "<S> our mass estimation method uses the line dispersion rather than the full width at half maximum of the low - ionization mgii  emission line . </S>",
    "<S> we measure mgii  line dispersions for quasars whose spectra have been reconstructed using the most significant eigenspectra produced through principal component analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested the reliability of using reconstructed spectra in black hole mass estimation using a monte carlo simulation and by comparing the results from original and reconstructed data release three spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we show that using reconstructed spectra not only makes bias - free mass estimation possible for quasars with low spectroscopic signal - to - noise ratio , but also reduces the intrinsic scatter of the distribution of the black hole masses to lower than 0.15 dex . </S>"
