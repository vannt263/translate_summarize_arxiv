    "the chiral anomaly  @xcite is a fundamental property of chiral quantum field theories such as the standard model of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . its theoretical origin and mathematical properties",
    "are well understood , while experimental tests , which are crucial for the theoretical basis of particle physics , are relatively rare .",
    "although the chiral anomaly can be interpreted as a short - distant effect , it manifests itself most directly in the low - energy interactions of the pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite .",
    "the chiral anomaly manifests itself also in the non - leptonic weak interactions . as already shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , only radiative k decays ( among them @xmath3 ) are sensitive to this anomaly .",
    "the total amplitude of the @xmath4 decay can be written as a sum of inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) and direct emission ( de ) amplitudes .",
    "the ib amplitude is associated with the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) decay , in which the photon is emitted from the outgoing @xmath2 , and is completely predicted by the quantum electrodynamics in terms of the @xmath6 amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the de amplitude , in which the photon is emitted directly from one of the intermediate states of the decay , can in turn be decomposed into electric and magnetic parts .    within the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , the magnetic amplitude appears first at @xmath7 .",
    "there are two different ways for its manifestation : the reducible amplitude  @xcite , which can be derived directly from the wess - zumino - witten functional  @xcite , and the direct contributions  @xcite , which are subject to some theoretical uncertainties . in both cases",
    "the direct emission amplitudes are dominated by the anomaly .",
    "for the electric amplitude there is no definite prediction from chpt .",
    "the experimental study of the electric amplitude , which could be observed through an interference ( int ) with the ib amplitude , is of high interest not only for chpt but also for possible non - standard - model effects such as the cp - violation asymmetry between the @xmath0 and the @xmath8 decay widths .",
    "the remarkable feature of the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 , is that the normally dominant ib amplitude is strongly suppressed because it violates the @xmath11=1/2 rule",
    ". therefore the de amplitude is relatively enhanced .",
    "the de component can also be isolated kinematically .",
    "these features simplify the experimental verification of the anomalous amplitude , making the @xmath4 decay an important instrument to investigate the low energy structure of qcd .    a conventional way to express",
    "the differential decay rate of the @xmath12 decay is to use terms of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath13 is the kinetic energy of the @xmath2 in the @xmath15 rest frame , and @xmath14 is an invariant parameter defined as @xmath16 . here ,",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the 4-momenta of the @xmath15 , @xmath2 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the differential decay rate can be written in terms of the ib component rate as  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the decay amplitude for the @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electric and magnetic amplitudes of the de component , respectively .",
    "the experimental status of the measurement of the de component of the @xmath26 decay is shown in table  [ tab : exp_situation ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have obtained an improved result for the branching ratio of direct photon emission in the @xmath4 decay from the analysis of the e470 data . we have extracted 10154 @xmath4 events in the @xmath2 momentum region of 115 to 180 mev / c , which is about 2.3 times more than in the previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "in addition to a reduction of the statistical error we have also reduced the systematic error by increasing the pairing efficiency of the photons .",
    "the optimization of the selection cuts allowed us to increase the total number of the extracted @xmath0 events , and to obtain more sensitivity to the de component part of the @xmath4 spectrum . in this analysis",
    "we have provided more efficient rejection of the @xmath27 background , which was estimated by mc simulation to be less than 0.2% as compared to 1.2% in the previous analysis .    the branching ratio for the de component in the @xmath2 kinetic energy region 55 to 90  mev has been determined to be @xmath28 \\times 10^{-6},\\ ] ] which is consistent with the results of the three last experiments  @xcite . the good agreement of this result with the theoretical prediction for the branching ratio of the de component , @xmath29  @xcite , supports the hypothesis that the dominant contribution to direct photon emission is due to the pure magnetic transition given by the reducible anomalous amplitude .",
    "it should also be stressed that the result has been obtained with the assumption that the int component is zero .",
