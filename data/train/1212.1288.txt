    "a boson of mass 125 gev , almost consistent with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , was recently discovered at the lhc experiments @xcite .",
    "the production rates of @xmath7 are consistent with the sm values while that of @xmath8 is somewhat higher than the sm expectation . on the other hand ,",
    "fermionic modes @xmath9 and @xmath10 seem to be suppressed in the present data set , however , the uncertainties are still too large to say anything concrete . nevertheless , the diphoton rate has seemed to stay above the sm prediction since 2011 . if it is confirmed after collecting more data at the end of 2012 , this would become a strong constraint on supersymmetry models and on other extended higgs models .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs boson can be raised to 125 gev by a large radiative correction with a relatively large soft parameter @xmath11 @xcite . however , the more difficult requirement is to achieve an enhanced diphoton production rate @xmath12 relative to the sm prediction .",
    "one possibility is to have a light scalar tau ( or stau ) , as light as 100 gev , which is made possible by choosing the third generation slepton masses @xmath13 gev , the parameter @xmath14 gev , and large @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "such a light stau will soon be confirmed or ruled out at the lhc .",
    "another possibility is to identify the heavier cp - even higgs boson as the observed 125 gev boson and the enhancement of the diphoton rate is then made possible by a reduction in @xmath9 width @xcite . in this case , all the other higgs bosons are around or below 125 gev , which will soon be uncovered at the lhc .",
    "yet , one can also fine - tune the mixing angle ( @xmath16 ) between the two cp - even higgs bosons such that the observed one is mostly @xmath17 , the higgs doublet that couples to the right - handed up - type quarks . in this case",
    ", one can achieve enhancement to the diphoton rate and suppression to the @xmath10 mode @xcite . among all these possible scenarios certain levels of fine - tuning are necessary to achieve a 125 higgs boson and an enhanced diphoton rate .",
    "it is quite well known that the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) gives additional tree - level contributions to the higgs boson mass arising from the terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the superpotential and the corresponding soft terms .",
    "the 125 gev cp - even higgs boson can be obtained as either the lightest or the second lightest one , without giving stress on the stop sector @xcite .",
    "the diphoton production rate can be enhanced through the singlet - doublet mixing .",
    "the second lightest cp - even higgs boson is the sm - like one while the lightest cp - even is more singletlike .",
    "the mixing between these two states substantially reduces the @xmath9 width of the sm - like higgs boson , which then causes an increase of the branching ratio into @xmath5 @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the @xmath20-extended minimal supersymmetric standard model ( umssm ) , which involves an extra @xmath0 symmetry and a higgs singlet superfield @xmath21 .",
    "it is well known that by adding the singlet higgs field one can easily raise the higgs boson mass .",
    "the scalar component of the higgs singlet superfield develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which breaks the @xmath20 symmetry and gives a mass to the @xmath20 gauge boson , denoted by @xmath22 . at the same time",
    ", the vev together with the yukawa coupling can form an effective @xmath23 parameter from the term @xmath24 in the superpotential , thus solving the @xmath25 problem of mssm . also , because of the presence of the @xmath20 symmetry , terms like @xmath26 , or @xmath27 are disallowed in the superpotential .",
    "the existence of extra neutral gauge bosons had been predicted in many extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "string - inspired models and grand - unified theory ( gut ) models usually contain a number of extra @xmath0 symmetries , beyond the hypercharge @xmath28 of the sm .",
    "the exceptional group @xmath29 is one of the famous examples of this type .",
    "phenomenologically , the most interesting option is the breaking of these @xmath0 s at around tev scales , giving rise to an extra neutral gauge boson observable at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "previously , in the works of refs.@xcite , a scenario of @xmath20 symmetry breaking at around tev scale by the vev of a higgs singlet superfield in the context of weak - scale supersymmetry was considered .",
    "the @xmath22 boson obtains a mass from the breaking of this @xmath20 symmetry that is proportional to the vevs .",
    "such a @xmath22 can decay into the susy particles such as neutralinos , charginos , and sleptons , in addition to the sm particles .",
    "thus , the current mass limits are reduced by a substantial amount and so is the sensitivity reach at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we have also considered the sm - like boson and its decay branching ratios into @xmath30 , and @xmath31 with the higgs boson mass in the ranges of @xmath32 and @xmath33 gev @xcite . in the first mass range @xmath32 gev , we selected the parameter space such that the sm - like higgs boson behaves like the sm higgs boson while in the second mass range @xmath33 gev , we selected the parameter space point to make sure that the higgs boson is hiding from the existing data .",
    "the goal in this work is to refine the previous analyses @xcite to scan for the parameter space such that    1 .",
    "the sm - like higgs boson falls in the mass range @xmath1 gev ; 2 .",
    "the production rates for @xmath34 are consistent with the sm within certainties ; 3 .",
    "the production rate for @xmath12 is enhanced relative to the sm prediction , namely , @xmath35 4 .",

    "in the next section , we briefly describe the model ( umssm ) and summarize the formulas for the one loop decays of the cp - even higgs bosons .",

    "the latter effect is possible if the sm - like higgs boson has a large mixing with another singlet - like higgs boson , e.g. , in the nmssm @xcite , such that the @xmath9 width is reduced by the mixing and therefore the @xmath5 branching ratio is enhanced .    for the choice of umssm parameters all the extra charged particles like the stau , top squark , sbottom and the charged higgs boson are relatively heavy .",
    "we have searched in the parameter space of umssm under the constraints of current higgs boson data , chargino - mass bound , and @xmath36 invisible width .",
    "we found that ( 1 ) the enhancement of the diphoton production rate is mainly due to the mixing between the higgs doublets and singlet , and ( 2 ) the lightest cp - even higgs boson is sm - like while the second lightest is more singletlike .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of nmssm , in which the lightest is singletlike and the second lightest is sm - like .    before closing , we offer a few more comments as follows .    1 .",
    "the relative production rate @xmath151 mostly goes in the same direction as @xmath148 , though the amount of enhancement in @xmath151 is less than @xmath148 .",
    "the probing of the @xmath6 mode of the observed higgs boson is an interesting test for the higgs boson from the sm or from its extensions . in the present luminosity ,",
    "it is rather difficult to probe the @xmath6 because it suffers an additional suppression from the leptonic branching ratio of the @xmath36 boson .",
    "almost all of the points have @xmath153 between @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "this is easy to understand because @xmath148 is enhanced by a reduced total width .",
    "therefore , the @xmath135 and @xmath4 branching ratios also increase .",
    "the mass of the second lightest cp - even higgs boson can not be too large , as shown in bottom panels of figs .",
    "[ one ] , [ two ] , [ three ] .",
    "again , this is easy to understand because in order to achieve a large doublet - singlet mixing between @xmath160 and @xmath162 their mass difference can not be too large .",
    "we found that @xmath190 gev for @xmath191 respectively .",
    "the detection of @xmath162 is rather difficult because of its singlet nature .",
    "the production cross section would be reduced significantly by the mixing .",
    "4 .   there are six physical neutralinos in the mass spectrum in umssm",
    ". the lightest one can be the dark matter candidate .",
    "if kinematics is allowed , it may lead to invisible modes for the decays of higgs bosons , @xmath22 or even @xmath36 .",
