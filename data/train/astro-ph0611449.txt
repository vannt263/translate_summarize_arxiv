    "the analysis of absorption systems in the spectra of high - redshift quasars has represented for several decades the only practical way to obtain information about the properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0 forest gives an unique insight into the one - dimensional distribution of low density hydrogen along the quasars line of sight .",
    "higher column - density features , i.e. the lyman - limit systems ( llss ) and the damped ly@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) , correspond to denser concentrations of atomic hydrogen and , for this reason , can be associated with galaxy formation .",
    "unfortunately the information from quasar absorption spectra is almost always one - dimensional .",
    "an interesting alternative to absorption studies is to try to detect the igm in emission rather than in absorption .",
    "the absorption of ionizing photons should be associated with the emission of fluorescent ly@xmath0 photons , as originally proposed by hogan & weymann ( 1987 ) .",
    "detection of the fluorescent emission would provide a three - dimensional picture of the neutral igm and proto - galactic clouds at high redshift .    in an earlier paper ( cantalupo et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter paper i ) , we constructed models of fluorescent emission in realistic hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "these simulations were normalized so as to produce the correct statistics for lyman limit absorption systems . for clouds that are optically thick to the ionizing radiation ( i.e. lyman limit systems and above ) , the surface brightness ( sb ) of the fluorescent emission",
    "is set by the strength of the ionizing background .",
    "unfortunately , the intensity of the uv background at @xmath5 ( e.g. haardt & madau 1996 ) corresponds to a maximum ly@xmath0 sb of @xmath6@xmath7  . detecting such a low sb is very challenging with present - day instrumentation .",
    "blind searches in the field have only produced a number of null results ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1990 ; martnez - gonzalez et al . 1995 ; bunker , marleau & graham 1998 ) .",
    "the sb of fluorescent emission will be higher if the local ionizing background is increased , e.g. for gas clouds lying close to a bright quasar . in paper",
    "i , we examined this effect and showed that it could boost the fluorescent emission to detectable levels over a large volume , i.e. of order 30,000 comoving mpc@xmath8 for a sufficiently bright quasar .",
    "the penalty for this boost is that the extra photo - ionization increases the total hydrogen column density that is required to reach a given neutral column density , i.e. to produce the maximum fluorescent surface brightness .",
    "this is the analogue of the proximity effect seen in quasar absorption spectra .",
    "it means that maximally fluorescent sources near to a quasar will be systems that , in the absence of the quasar , would be dlas rather than lls .",
    "dlas have hydrogen column densities comparable to a sightline through the disk of present day spiral galaxies and a total gas mass similar to the mass in stars and gas within galaxies at the present epoch ( wolfe et al .",
    "1995 ) . for these reasons",
    ", dlas are widely believed to be the gas reservoirs from which the present galaxies formed .",
    "however , it is still unclear if dlas are galaxies already in place ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 1998 ) or are still in the form of protogalactic clouds ( e.g. haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 1998 ) .",
    "they typically contain very little of the molecular hydrogen usually associated with star formation ( e.g. ledoux et al .",
    "2003 , but see also zwaan & prochaska 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , metallicity measurements show a large range from 1/10 solar to a value close to that measured for the ly@xmath0 forest ( cf .",
    "prochaska et al .",
    "2003 and simcoe et al .",
    "it is likely that dlas include systems of different origins .",
    "in addition to studying the intergalactic medium , the detection and measurement of fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission from clouds at different distances and orientations from the quasar , would in principle allow the study of the history and angular distribution of the ultraviolet emission from quasars .",
    "both questions are of considerable topical interest in the context of unified models of active galactic nuclei ( see e.g. antonucci 1993 ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe a blind survey for fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission carried out around the @xmath9 quasar qso0420 - 388 , one of the brightest quasars at high redshift for which the ly@xmath0 line lies within an existing narrow - band filter of the vlt - fors2 instrument .",
    "previous searches for fluorescence around quasars have had either null results at @xmath10 ( francis & bland - hawthorn 2004 ) or only one ( or marginally two ) possible detection at @xmath11 ( francis & mcdonnell 2006 ) . in the first case ,",
    "the null result is perfectly consistent with our model of fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission presented in paper i. in the second case , the very close association of the system with the quasar itself makes the identification with fluorescence difficult ( see section [ other_lit ] for details ) .",
    "other possible fluorescent sources have been detected serendipitously in connection with absorbing systems in quasar pairs ( fynbo et al .",
    "1999 , adelberger et al .",
    "however , the metallicity of the systems and the presence of a substantial continuum emission probably indicate the presence of star formation within the clouds .",
    "ly@xmath0 emission at high redshift can of course be produced by internally ionized clouds , either from an associated young stellar population or from processes involving the gas itself ( e.g. cooling ) .",
    "several observations during the last decade have shown that these emitters are quite common in the high - redshift universe ( for a review see taniguchi et al .",
    "2003 ) and enhanced by clustering effects around bright sources like agns and , in particular , radio - galaxies ( e.g. venemans et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) . in searching for fluorescence",
    ", we must thus take into account the presence of this population .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we compare the characteristics of fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission with those of other sources of ly@xmath0 emission at high redshift , in order to determine which properties can best be used to recognize fluorescent emission .",
    "although fluorescent sources should have characteristic equivalent widths ( extremely high ) , sb and spectral profiles , none of these provide a unique diagnostic .",
    "we conclude this section by reviewing recent claims in the literature for detected fluorescence . in ",
    "3 we describe our own new observations and the data reduction .",
    "we then isolate a set of ly@xmath0 emitting candidates around the target quasar . in  4 ,",
    "we discuss in detail the properties of the individual sources in the context of the expected fluorescent characteristics , and compare their number density with both our own models for fluorescence ( paper i ) and those of other non - fluorescent ly@xmath0 sources .",
    "we conclude that it is likely , but not certain , that some of the detected sources that we have detected are indeed fluorescent . in ",
    "5 we summarize the paper .",
    "besides fluorescent emission , ly@xmath0 can be produced by several kinds of internal sources , e.g. photo - ionization from a young stellar population or active nucleus ( lae , ly@xmath0 emitter [ galaxies ] ) , or from cooling of shock - heated gas .",
    "many observations during the last decade have shown that ly@xmath0 emitters are quite common in the high - redshift universe ( e.g. cowie & hu 1998 ; pascarelle , windhorst & kell 1998 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2003 ) and enhanced by clustering effects around objects like agns and , in particular , radio - galaxies ( e.g. le fevre et al.1996 ; pascarelle et al .",
    "1996 ; venemans et al . 2005 ) which likely reside in high density regions of the universe .    in this section ,",
    "we review the characteristic properties that in principle could identify a source as fluorescent : i ) the equivalent width ( ew ) , ii ) the emission profile , iii ) the surface brightness ( sb ) , and iv ) the number density of emitters",
    ". we will take advantage of the model recently presented in paper i , in which a combination of a high - resolution hydrodynamic simulation and two radiative transfer schemes was used to predict the properties , spectra and number density of fluorescent ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath5 .      in the fluorescent case",
    ", the ly@xmath0 emission originates from pure gaseous clouds externally photo - ionized .",
    "therefore , any continuum emission comes only from recombination processes : mainly two - photon continuum and free - bound recombinations .",
    "however , given the low value of the emission coefficient corresponding to these processes , the continuum level around the ly@xmath0 wavelength is very faint , resulting in an extremely high ew .",
    "the case of ly@xmath0 emission originating from cooling shock - heated gas will be similar .    if the ly@xmath0 emission results from photo - ionization by embedded young stars , we expect a significant contribution to the uv continuum emission from the stellar population . in this case",
    ", the ly@xmath0 ew depends on the age , initial mass function ( imf ) , metallicity and dust content of the star - formation burst .",
    "synthesis population models ( see e.g. schaerer 2003 and references therein ) show that high ews can be produced for very young bursts in metal - poor and dust - free galaxies .",
    "upper limits for very metal - poor models ( @xmath12 ) range from ew@xmath13 ( for a very young population with an age of 2 myr ) to ew@xmath14 ( for a 10 myr old star - formation burst ) .",
    "synthesis models of star - forming galaxies with moderate ages ( @xmath15 myr ) and with metallicity ( and imf ) closer to the normally observed values have ew in the range @xmath16 @xmath17 ( charlot & fall 1993 ) .",
    "surveys of ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath5 usually show a distribution of ew in the range from @xmath18 , with a few objects extending to higher values ( up to 200 - 300@xmath17 ) .",
    "high - ew objects can also be associated with agn activity .",
    "the properties of the ly@xmath0 line have been widely studied analytically under certain approximations ( e.g. neufeld 1990 and references therein ) . in particular , for an extremely opaque and plane - parallel medium , it is possible to demonstrate that the emerging profile consists of two symmetric peaks separated by a velocity shift of @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the central - line optical depth of ly@xmath0 photons and the thermal velocity dispersion of the medium ) .    since fluorescent photons",
    "originate from externally ionized clouds , their typical @xmath20 should correspond to @xmath22 ( assuming a temperature of @xmath23 k ) .",
    "therefore , in the above approximations , fluorescent emission should be characterized by two symmetric peaks separated by @xmath24 .",
    "however , detailed simulations of fluorescent emission in more realistic situations show that the inclusion of velocity fields inside and around the clouds influences the emerging line profile . in most cases ,",
    "the symmetry of the double - humped profile is lost and one of the two peaks is severely suppressed ( see fig . 7 in paper i",
    "; notice that the x - scale of that figure is erroneously multiplied by a factor of 4 ) .",
    "furthermore , if the gas consists of several small clumps , a turbulent velocity term should be added to the thermal velocity dispersion , increasing the separation of the peaks . on the other hand ,",
    "if the turbulent velocity of the emitting region is large compared with that of the intervening layers , the symmetry of the line profile may be restored .    while the double peaked nature of fluorescent emission can be modified ,",
    "the single ly@xmath0 lines generated by internal photo - ionization at low optical depth can be partially absorbed by infalling or expanding gas . as a result ,",
    "the emergent profile can again consist of multiple components .",
    "we conclude that these practicalities mean that the analysis of the emission line profile alone can not provide a watertight signature of fluorescence .    clccccc[h ! ] s1 & nov .",

    "e.g. from a nearby quasar , the fluorescent sb would be expected in this simplified geometry to be higher .",
    "we introduce a `` boost factor '' @xmath27 , which is defined as the increase in the predicted sb relative to that induced by the uv background at @xmath5 ( @xmath28@xmath7 ) , i.e. sb@xmath29sb@xmath30 . the value of @xmath27 corresponds to : @xmath31 at a physical distance @xmath32 from a quasar with monochromatic luminosity @xmath33 ( see figs.6,9 and section 3.3 in paper i for further details ) .",
    "when velocity fields and a more realistic gas distribution are taken into account , it is found ( paper i ) that the sb may be reduced . in particular , for anisotropic illumination ( i.e. fluorescence induced by a quasar ) , the expected sb in the direction of the incoming flux can be much lower than expected in the slab approximation .",
    "the importance of this effect , which we called the `` geometric effect '' , depends on the relative size of the shielding - layer with respect to the cloud radius , and therefore on the gas density profile and the intensity of the impinging radiation . in paper",
    "i , we found that the fluorescent sb from self - shielded clouds is still predictable in good approximation from the empirical relation : @xmath34 where @xmath27 represents the ideal `` boost factor '' described above .",
    "the sb predicted in this way represents a fundamental upper - limit constraint : emitters with higher sb must receive a ionizing contribution from other sources and , therefore , are with high probability internally ionized clouds .",
    "however , several uncertainties remain to be taken into account . in particular ,",
    "the exact distance from the quasar may be uncertain due to peculiar motions ( and uncertainty in the precise systemic redshift of the quasar ) .",
    "anisotropy or time - variability in the quasar emission will also modify the sb .",
    "in fact this latter effect offers the possibility , if other indicators indicate a fluorescent origin of the emission , that their sbes can be used to study the angular distribution and temporal history of the quasar uv emission .      the covering factor of fluorescent sources on the sky within a volume is directly related to the number density of optically thick absorbers seen in quasar spectra .",
    "this fact was used in paper i to normalise our simulations .",
    "two complications enter in the present case .",
    "first , the regions around quasars are likely to have higher than average density .",
    "second , the enhanced ionizing radiation will produce a higher photo - ionization in a given cloud , reducing the column density of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the high surface brightness fluorescence will still come from systems which would be seen as lls if there was a background quasar , but these are systems that would have been seen as dla if the extra ionizing radiation had not been present .",
    "the fluorescence near to a quasar is thus closely linked to the `` proximity effect '' ( e.g. bajtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ) .",
    "since statistics of lls near qsos are not constrained , we must rely on theoretical models to determine their covering factor .",
    "the procedure to calculate the expected number of fluorescent emitters around a quasar , outlined in section 3.4 in paper i , consists of three steps : i ) convert the sb sensitivity limit of the survey ( sb@xmath35 ) into a minimum boost factor @xmath36 inverting eq.([fsb ] ) , ii ) use @xmath37 in figure 11 of paper i to determine the physical number density of fluorescent sources with sb@xmath38sb@xmath39 ; iii ) given the values of @xmath40 , @xmath0 for the selected quasar , invert eq .

    ", a sensitivity of sb@xmath42@xmath7  corresponds to a fluorescent ( physical ) number density of @xmath43 mpc@xmath44 ( for sources with area @xmath45 arcsec@xmath46 ) , neglecting any density enhancement around the quasar .",
    "this may be compared with the number density of other ly@xmath0 sources around @xmath5 quasars .",
    "recent surveys indicate that the number of ly@xmath0 emitters around radio - galaxies at that redshift can be enhanced by a factor @xmath47 with respect to the field .",
    "in particular , venemans et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter v05 ) found an emitter number density of @xmath48 mpc@xmath44 around the @xmath49 radio - galaxy mrc0316 - 257 , in a survey with sensitivity of the order of sb@xmath42@xmath7  .",
    "in the view of the agn unified model ( see e.g. antonucci 1993 ) , the environment of radio - loud quasars should be similar to that of radio - galaxies .",
    "moreover , we do not expect a significant contribution from fluorescent sources to the number density found by v05 , given the shape of their survey and the direction of the ( probable ) uv emission - cone from mrc0316 - 257 .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe previous surveys for fluorescent emission and review the results of these in the light of our discussion above .",
    "given the difficulties in the detection of fluorescence induced by the uv - background alone , previous surveys have centered around quasars , as in our case .",

    "in particular , they were expecting to find at least 6 fluorescent emitters within their sampled region of 1 mpc around the quasar , but they saw none .",
    "however , this result is perfectly consistent with the expectation of our more realistic model of fluorescent emission ( see section 3.5 in paper i for details ) .",

    "( 2006 ) reported the serendipitous discovery of a possible fluorescent emitter associated with a dla at redshift @xmath51 .",

    "the object consists of two peaks with separation @xmath52 km s@xmath53 and its sb seems to be compatible with the fluorescence induced by the quasar , even though the required boost factor is extremely high ( @xmath54 , in the ideal case of a slab ) .",

    "( 1999 ) . in this case",
    "a continuum counterpart is not clearly detected , although the subtraction of the psf of the bright quasars makes this difficult .",
    "however , the extreme proximity of the quasar responsible of the possible fluorescent emission ( @xmath60kpc ) , indicates a plausible physical connection between the two objects .    finally , francis & mcdonnell ( 2006 ) claimed the detection of a fluorescent object located just 0.8  from a quasar at @xmath61",
    "their object is spectrally and spatially unresolved and the flux is poorly constrained because of the proximity of the quasar .",
    "there is a lower limit for the equivalent width of ew@xmath62 .",

    "the detection of line emission candidates was performed with the help of the software package sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . in order to make the detection process more efficient , we first removed from each image the regions corresponding to the brightest continuum spectra ( typically stars and local bright galaxies ) .",
    "such regions were automatically identified for each slit by summing the flux over the spectral band and applying a sigma - clipping algorithm to the resulting 1-dimensional array .",

    "[ sbplot ] are calculated assuming isotropic and time - invariant emission from the quasar .",
    "the candidates beyond the quasar could have been illuminated by a different uv flux with respect to the value measured by us .",
    "in particular , gas clouds at 20 comoving mpc from the quasar ( within which most of our candidates were found ) should be responding to the ionizing flux of the quasar that was emitted or order @xmath132 yrs before the epoch of observation . at 40 comoving mpc , where candidates # 4 , # 5 and # 6 lie ,",
    "the time delay is two times larger , i.e. @xmath133 yrs , close to the expected life - time of the quasar ( e.g. porciani , magliocchetti & norberg 2004 ) .    turning the argument around",
    ", the effect of the time delay may represent a direct way to measure the radiative history of quasars , if the fluorescent origin of the sources can be proved .",
    "if we assume that our object # 4 is truly fluorescent , which is plausible given the high ew and the clear double - peaked profile , its sb would provide us with direct proof that the quasar was shining @xmath134 yr ago with an ultraviolet luminosity 6 - 10 times higher than the present measurements .",
    "confirmation of the fluorescent origin of object # 4 would for this reason be especially interesting .    in conclusion ,",
    "what we can say about the fluorescent nature of our detected objects ?",
    "unfortunately , there is no definitive evidence of fluorescence .",
    "the ew can be poorly constrained for most of our candidates , requiring extremely deep broad - band images ( for ground observations ) .",
    "the sb - distance relation ( as well as the emission - line profile ) , given all the theoretical and observational uncertainties discussed above , is only an approximate indicator .",
    "nevertheless , collecting all the indication so far , we can highlight 5 of the 13 objects which are most probably not fluorescent , i.e. # 3 ( low - ew ) , # 5 ( too high sb ) , # 6 ( both low - ew and too high sb ) , # 11 and # 12 ( both objects are unresolved , in front of the quasar and with sb at the limit for fluorescence ) .",
    "however , given their higher upper limit on the ew ( mainly because of their high line - flux ) and their sb , objects # 1 and # 2 ( if @xmath135 ) could be good candidates for fluorescence .",
    "as noted above , object # 4 could also be a good candidate , because the profile is flat in the center and the presence of a double - peaked profile , compatible with fluorescence if @xmath121 km s@xmath53 .",
    "finally , objects # 7 , # 8 , # 10 , # 12 and # 13 have sbs compatible with fluorescent emission ( for both quasar redshifts ) , but the ew is poorly constrained .    as a final remark , it is worth stressing that self - shielded fluorescent emitters around a quasar could also be detected in absorption as the equivalent of dlas in the field ( see  1 for further details ) . therefore , the existence of such a fluorescent population could in principle support the association of dlas with proto - galactic gas clouds ( e.g. haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 1998 ) .",
    "however , even if all fluorescent emitters around a quasar are dlas , this does not imply the converse , allowing the possibility of a different origin for a part of these absorbing systems , like disk galaxies already in place ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 1998 )",
    ".      given our sensitivity limits ( sb@xmath42@xmath7 for a typical aperture of @xmath76 ) and the assumed value of @xmath136 and @xmath0 for our quasar , we can use the procedure discussed in  2 to derive the expected number of fluorescent and not - fluorescent sources in our volume .",
    "we find a physical number density of fluorescent emitters of @xmath43 mpc@xmath44 , detectable within @xmath137 physical mpc from the quasar .",
    "given the projected area covered by our slits in all three configurations ( @xmath138 physical mpc@xmath46 ) , we therefore should be able to detect fluorescent emission within a total volume @xmath139 physical mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the shape of this volume is approximatively a cuboid , being constrained from the limited field of view of the detector ( @xmath140 , corresponding to a physical mpc scale of @xmath141 at this redshift ) .",
    "therefore the number of expected fluorescent emitters within @xmath142 from the quasar is @xmath143 .",
    "notice , however , that this number does not take into account : ( i ) the expected enhancement of the number density of objects around the quasar due to clustering effects , ( ii ) any reduction due to beaming of the quasar emission - although we note that we would expect the illuminated cone to include the line of sight and thus to be more or less aligned with the accessible volume . in this context",
    "we looked to see whether foreground and background candidates were located on different sides of the quasar , possibly indicating beaming , but found no evidence of this .    by comparison",
    ", we expect @xmath144 non - fluorescent sources in our total sampled volume if it is similar to the radio galaxy environment studied by v05 .    despite the small statistics and with all the many uncertainties , these numbers agree very well with the detected number of objects in our survey .",
    "it may be a coincidence , but it is certainly consistent with the indication that about half of our detected sources may have a fluorescent origin .",
    "based on our recent model of fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission ( paper i ) , we carried out a ly@xmath0 survey around the @xmath9 quasar qso 0420 - 388 to search for signatures of fluorescence .",
    "we used a `` multi - slit plus filter '' technique to sparsely sample a volume of @xmath2 comoving mpc@xmath3 around the quasar ( directly sampling @xmath145 comoving mpc@xmath3 ) .",
    "we found 13 emission line sources , selected on equivalent width , which are likely to be ly@xmath0 at a redshift close to the quasar . in order to try to distinguish fluorescent objects from internally ionized clouds",
    ", we measured three possible signatures of fluorescence : i ) the line equivalent width , ii ) the line profile , iii ) the sb .",
    "we also calculated the expected number of fluorescent and non - fluorescent sources from theoretical models and recent ly@xmath0 surveys .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the best constraints would be a very high ew and , within some limitations , the relation of the sb with the distance from the quasar .",
    "instead , the line profile can not give precise information on the nature of the sources - a double - peaked profile is a possible indication of fluorescence , but it can be absent , or be present in non - fluorescent sources .    unfortunately , given the current observational limits , there is at present no definitive evidence for fluorescence .",
    "there are good reasons to suspect that 5 objects are probably not - fluorescent , and this estimate is in good agreement with the number density of such sources around radio galaxies . of the remaining 8 objects , two or three of them are quite good fluorescent candidates , based on moderately high upper limits to their ew , and , in some cases , the presence of extended emission with a flat sb and a double - peaked profile .",
    "the remaining @xmath146 candidates are consistent with fluorescence , but their upper - limits on the ew are low enough to provide little real constraint .    on the basis of our model ( paper i ) , we were expecting @xmath147 fluorescent sources in the inner region around the quasar , and , from other surveys of ly@xmath0 emitters around agns , we were expecting @xmath148 non - fluorescent sources in the total sampled volume .",
    "these estimates are certainly consistent with the idea that about half of our detected sources could be fluorescent .    in this case",
    ", the distance of most of the candidates from the ionizing source would imply that the quasar has been active for at least 30 myr , with a uv luminosity similar ( within a factor of a few ) to the present day value .",
    "in particular , one of the best candidates for fluorescence is sufficiently far behind the quasar to imply a life - time of @xmath149 myr .",
    "although there are uncertainties in interpretation , due to both observational limitations and theoretical uncertainties ( and no doubt a range of phenomena in nature ) , the current study provides one of the first statistical samples of possible fluorescent emitters around a high - redshift quasar .",
