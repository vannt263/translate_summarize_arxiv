    "quantum electronic transport in disordered structures has been of fundamental and practical interest since seminal ideas by anderson and mott.@xcite recently , transport in driven systems has received much attention since new phenomena have been found and the application of a time - dependent driving field opens more possibilities to control the transport in an electronic device .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed the possibility of manipulating the electronic transport through molecular structures by applying an ac field .",
    "@xcite    disorder in a sample can be an unavoidable and unwanted ingredient in transport experiments , however , it can also be seen as an ingredient to be exploited in order to manipulate the transport properties of a system .",
    "the disorder gives a random character to the transport and a statistical analysis naturally emerges . in the absence of ac fields ,",
    "the statistics of quantities such as the conductance has been widely studied . at present",
    ", there is a good understanding of the effects of disorder on the statistical properties of the conductance for one- and quasi - one dimensional systems within a non - interacting electron model .",
    "in fact , the distribution of conductances is known , within a scaling approach to localization , at zero temperature and infinitesimally small applied voltage : @xcite for one- and quasi - one dimensional systems the evolution of the conductance distribution as a function of the length of the sample is described by the melnikov and dorokhov - mello - pereyra - kumar ( dmpk ) equations , respectively . for finite temperatures and bias voltages as well as higher dimensions ,",
    "some progress has been made on the description of the conductance statistics.@xcite    in contrast to the well studied problem of electronic transport in nondriven disordered systems and in spite of the possible interest for applications , remarkably little is known about the statistical properties of transport quantities when a time - dependent field is applied ; effects of energy fluctuations on the current statistics in short molecular wires has been studied in ref .",
    "[ ] , while effects of ac fields on the localization length and the conductance distribution of a ring driven by a time - dependent magnetic flux have been studied in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] , respectively .     driven by a frequency - dependent force .",
    "the quantum wire is connected to electron reservoirs @xmath1 and @xmath2 . ]    in this work , we calculate the complete distribution of the conductance of a disordered quantum wire subject to a time - periodic driving field .",
    "we obtain the distribution from high to low frequencies with different regimes of disorder strength and localization .",
    "our theoretical results are compared to tight - binding numerical simulations .",
    "we start by describing briefly the model of our driven quantum wire .",
    "the conductance is calculated adopting a floquet scattering approach to the electronic transport problem generalizing the landauer - bttiker formulation to driven systems .",
    "@xcite    we might think of an experimental setup where a disordered sample , attached by perfect leads to a reservoir of electrons on each side , is subject to a laser beam with an angle of incidence perpendicular to the wire and a polarization angle parallel to the wire , fig .",
    "we assume that such a system is described by the following time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath3 the wire hamiltonian @xmath4 is time - periodic : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the frequency of the applied field . for each term in eq .",
    "( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) we have : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total number of sites of the wire , @xmath10 is the band width of the nondriven system , and @xmath11 is the field amplitude ( a factor of 2 is introduced by computational convenience ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for the leads @xmath12 is modeled as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the creation operator for an electron at the left lead ( right ) with momentum @xmath15 and the coupling lead - wire hamiltonian @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 the coupling can be described by the spectral density : @xmath18 .",
    "the driving field might have an effect on the coupling leads - wire , however , this situation can be mapped onto a hamiltonian of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) by a gauge transformation .",
    "@xcite we use the wide - band approximation where we assume that the coupling between leads and wire is energy independent .",
    "this treatment is justified whenever the conduction bandwidth of the leads is much larger than all other relevant energy scales in our problem .",
    "we use it as we are interested in the effect of the driving in the conductance distribution and not of the details of the coupling to the leads . in this approximation",
    "the information of the wire - coupling can be introduced via two self - energies at the first and last sites of the wire ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) transforming the wire hamiltonian to a non - hermitian hamiltonian . under the above assumptions and within a tight binding approximation , the hamiltonian associated to our quantum wire can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the random on - site energy , distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath23 .",
    "the form of the external time - dependent field assumes a dipolar approximation for a monochromatic field so the wavelength of the laser light must be longer than the length of the wire . as the hamiltonian is time - periodic , the floquet theorem states that there is a set of solutions @xmath24floquet states  to the equation @xmath25|\\phi_\\epsilon^{\\alpha , m}(t)\\rangle = \\epsilon^{\\alpha , m}|\\phi_\\epsilon^{\\alpha , m}(t)\\rangle , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 with @xmath27 an integer number and @xmath28 .",
    "the green s function @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30g(e , t',t''){\\mathbb i}={\\mathbb i}\\delta_t(t'-t'')$ ] , where @xmath31 is the identity operator and @xmath32 is a @xmath33-periodic delta function , can be written in terms of the floquet states @xmath34 . thus the fourier components @xmath35 of @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 we define the dc - conductance for an ac - driven quantum wire as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the current averaged over one period of the driving field .",
    "thus @xmath40 is an experimentally accessible quantity which can be written as a sum of the floquet modes @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , \\ ] ] with @xmath44 being the transmission for electrons from the left to the right lead , similarly @xmath45 for electrons from the right to the left . in the static case ,",
    "@xmath46 for systems with time - reversal symmetry , however , in the presence of time - dependent fields this is not longer true @xcite .",
    "when both transmissions are not equal , a current at zero voltage can be induced ( pumped current ) .",
    "this pumped current appears as an offset at zero voltage in the @xmath47 characteristic of our system .",
    "the presence of a pumped current does not modify our formulas , as we calculate the slope of the @xmath47 curve at zero voltage . in the systems we considered",
    "the pumped current is very much reduced as the length of the systems increases and is , in general , negligible , in contrast to results by kaiser _ et .",
    "[ ] , where they study the current in shorter molecular wires ( @xmath48 ) .    we are thus interested in the statistics of the conductance @xmath40 given by eq .",

    "the numerical simulations are performed according to eqs .",
    "( [ gk ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , where the fourier components @xmath49 are calculated using the method of matrix continued fractions .",
    "@xcite we assume perfect lead - wire coupling ( @xmath50 ) although different coupling strengths can be implemented in our numerical simulations and theoretical framework .",
    "the histograms shown in all the figures of this work were obtained from 2000 different disorder realizations .",

    "we start with the simplest case which turns out to be the high frequency regime characterized by frequencies @xmath59 .",
    "it is also convenient to begin with this regime since it illustrates in a simple way the approach to our conductance calculations along this work .    in the absence of disorder and for high frequencies",
    "it has been shown that the conductance is proportional to the square of the bessel function @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite a key point is that this frequency - dependent factor @xmath60 remains under the presence of disorder .",
    "@xcite thus , for a disordered wire we write the conductance @xmath40 as the product @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the dimensionless conductance of the disordered wire in the absence of the driving field .",
    "the calculation of the distribution of @xmath40 is now straightforward since the conductance distribution for the static case @xmath64 is given by the solution of the melnikov equation , which is given by @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 , l being the mean free path .",
    "@xmath68 can be seen as a disorder parameter which can be obtained from the disorder - average : @xmath69 . in order to calculate @xmath0",

    "[ fig_2 ] we compare eq .",
    "( [ pofgapprox ] ) with the numerical simulations for different values of disorder , frequencies , and field amplitudes .",
    "a good agreement is seen in all cases .",
    "we point out the sharp cut - off of the distributions , which is determined by the frequency - dependent term @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ gproptog ] ) .",
    "this is a manifestation of the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling or dynamical localization by the interference of multiple paths due to the rapid oscillations of the external field .",
    "@xcite this strong effect on the statistics suggests the possibility of controlling the conductance : by tuning properly the applied field the conductance through the disorder sample can be completely switched off at a desired conductance value .",
    "we finally remark that the complete conductance distribution is determined by the frequency - dependent term @xmath75 and the disorder parameter @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ newlocalization ] )      let us consider first the strong localization regime ( @xmath76 ) where the analysis of the conductance statistics is particularly simple . as we shall see , when @xmath77 becomes of the same order of @xmath78 the calculations of the distribution of the conductance are more involved .",
    "when we increase the disorder strength and/or choose the field parameters ( amplitude , frequency ) such that the system is strongly localized , we observe that the floquet modes are strongly correlated ; we show two typical examples of this behavior in the insets of fig .",
    "3 , where we plot the distribution @xmath79 of difference between the first and second transmission floquet modes @xmath80 ( we have divided this difference between modes by @xmath81 with the only purpose of measuring @xmath80 in units of conductance average ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath79 is highly concentrated at small values of @xmath80 .",
    "we point out that in the localized regime @xmath82 and since @xmath40 is the sum of the floquet modes , eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) , it is expected that each floquet mode is in the localized regime . on the other hand",
    ", we recall that in the static case , the conductance distribution follows a log - normal distribution .",
    "thus , the distribution of the logarithm of the total conductance is given by the convolution of log - normal distributions , i.e. , each of these distributions corresponds to a floquet mode .",
    "the resulting distribution is again a log - normal distribution .",

    "the average and variance of @xmath95 are extracted from the numerical data and substituted into eq .",
    "( [ poflogg ] ) . a good agreement between theory and numerics",
    "is seen .",
    "perhaps the most interesting case is when the system is not strongly localized by the ac field and/or disorder .",
    "we go further with our approach to the problem where the statistics of the frequency - dependent conductance fluctuations are derived from the statistical properties of the transport problem of the static case . for instance",
    ", we have found that the floquet modes @xmath96 show similar correlations to the conductance channels of the multichannel ( static ) case .",
    "for simplicity we shall consider the case where two floquet modes @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is also considered , statistically , it gives the same contribution as @xmath98 ) give the main contribution to @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite    we recall that the dmpk equation is derived for a disordered wire whose length @xmath77 is much larger than its width @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , i.e. , a quasi - one - dimensional system . within this limit",
    "the diffusion of electrons in the transverse direction can be neglected , although several transverse modes or channels might be open and contribute to the conductance . for an energy of electrons @xmath102 and for a given channel @xmath103 , the longitudinal energy @xmath104",
    "is given by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , @xmath103 being a positive integer .",
    "it is important to remark that within the dmpk framework only longitudinal diffusion is considered and the information of the number of modes is given through the energies of the finite number of open channels . in our one - dimensional wire driven by an periodic ac field ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation are given by @xmath107 , an expression similar to the static case ; however , @xmath27 takes unrestricted values ( positive and negative ) whereas the open channels @xmath103 are finite in the static case . with this argumentation",
    "we expect that the statistical properties of the time - dependent problem can be described through the known statistical properties of the static case for a quasi - one - dimensional geometry .",
    "as we have mentioned above , we consider the case where two floquet modes give the major contribution to the conductance .",
    "we shall thus use the dmpk results for two open channels . within the dmpk framework ,",
    "the joint distribution of the variables @xmath108 related to the conductance @xmath109 by @xmath110 , where @xmath103 labels the channels ( @xmath111 ) , is given by@xcite @xmath112 , \\ ] ] where @xmath113^{1/2}}$ ] , @xmath114 .",

    "the solid line is the analytic result with @xmath119 ( top ) and @xmath120 ( bottom ) .",

    "these results for @xmath123 give us confidence in using the solution of the dmpk equation , eq .",

    "this factor is estimated as the ratio @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the conductance average when the ac field is switched off .",

    "notice the sharp decay of the distributions , although it is not as strong as the high frequency regime .",
    "the distributions are also shifted from the origin due to renormalization value of the conductance @xmath126 in eq .",

    "the value of @xmath126 depends on some complex interference pattern and as the results in fig .",
    "4 show , it can vary widely with a small variation in the parameters of the model .",
    "the statistical properties of the quantum transport in driven disordered systems by ac fields are not well known . here",
    "we have studied the effects of an applied ac field on the conductance distribution under different conditions by varying the disorder strength and field parameters .",
