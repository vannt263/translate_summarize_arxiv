    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is well established as the theory of the strong interaction , yet it is expressed in terms of quarks and gluons , which are confined in color - neutral hadrons and are not observed in isolation . while high - energy scattering of quarks and gluons is calculable perturbatively from theory alone , perturbative calculations can not be used without experimental input to determine the quark and gluon structure of qcd bound states or the process of hadronization of a scattered quark or gluon . performing high - energy experimental measurements involving hadrons permits the study of nonperturbative aspects of qcd supported by the robust and directly calculable framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "in particular , hadron structure can be described in terms of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and parton hadronization in terms of fragmentation functions ( ffs ) .",
    "these nonperturbative , or long - distance , descriptions factorize from the perturbative , or short - distance , partonic hard scattering process , and they are universal across different observable reactions .",
    "a great deal about nucleon structure has been learned from experimental measurements of inclusive deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) , with complementary knowledge gained from other scattering processes .",
    "proton - proton scattering to produce jets , hadrons , or direct photons provides access to gluons at leading order in pqcd ; the drell - yan process of quark - antiquark annihilation to leptons and drell - yan - like processes such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 boson production enable explicit tagging of antiquarks in the nucleon sea .",
    "the dependence of inclusive dis on the hard momentum scale of the scattering , @xmath13 , offers an additional handle on gluon distributions for observables measured over a wide range of hard scales , and semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) , in which a produced hadron is observed in addition to the scattered lepton , offers another possibility to disentangle quark flavor contributions .",
    "different experimental measurements allow access to different aspects of proton structure .",
    "measurements involving unpolarized protons and a single observed hard momentum scale , enabling the framework of pqcd to be employed , constrain the unpolarized collinear pdfs ; measurements involving longitudinally polarized protons and a single hard scale constrain helicity - dependent collinear pdfs .",
    "further , measurements sensitive to partonic intrinsic transverse momentum can constrain transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) pdfs , while exclusive measurements allow access to spatial distributions of partons within the proton .",
    "all of these aspects of the partonic structure of the nucleon can in turn be studied in nuclei . for recent reviews on nucleon structure ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is an extremely versatile hadronic collider , having achieved collisions of ion species from protons to uranium over an energy range from a few gev to several hundred gev . with the ability to control the polarization direction of proton beams from 25 to 255  gev , corresponding to center - of - mass energies of 50 to 510  gev , rhic is excellently suited to study numerous aspects of nucleon structure .",
    "one of the main goals of the nucleon structure program at rhic has been to better constrain the helicity pdfs of the proton , given that experimental measurements indicate that only 2535% of the proton s longitudinal spin is carried by the quark spins  @xcite , significantly less than the prediction based on the simple parton model  @xcite .",
    "according to the jaffe - manohar sum rule for the spin of the proton  @xcite , the proton s longitudinal spin can be decomposed as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the net quark and antiquark spin , @xmath8 is the net gluon spin , and @xmath16 is the orbital angular momentum of partons . within the jaffe - manohar decomposition ,",
    "it is known how to compare @xmath17 and @xmath8 to experimental measurements as they are gauge invariant .",
    "particularly , @xmath8 has a physical interpretation as gluon spin in the light cone gauge .",
    "for a recent review of helicity sum rules and the interpretations of their components , see  @xcite .",
    "rhic measurements of the double - longitudinal spin asymmetry in the production of hadrons  @xcite and jets  @xcite , as well as single - longitudinal spin asymmetry measurements in the production of @xmath11 bosons  @xcite , have already been used in helicity pdf fits  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , large transverse single - spin asymmetries in forward particle production , sensitive to spin - momentum correlations in qcd , have been measured at rhic in transversely polarized proton collisions  @xcite .",
    "using hadrons in the final state to study nucleon structure , i.e.  in the processes of @xmath5@xmath6@xmath5 to hadrons or sidis , requires knowledge of ffs .",
    "fragmentation functions are in a sense complementary to pdfs .",
    "while pdfs describe the behavior of colored quarks and gluons bound in a colorless hadron , ffs describe a colored quark or gluon transitioning into one or more colorless hadrons . as in the case of pdfs ,",
    "different experimental measurements can provide a variety of information on ffs .",
    "much has been learned from the process of electron - positron annihilation to hadrons , while @xmath5@xmath6@xmath5 collisions are especially useful in constraining gluon ffs , and sidis data can provide information on quark flavor .",
    "hadron production in @xmath5@xmath6@xmath5 collisions offers additional flavor sensitivity , and the @xmath13 evolution of hadrons produced in @xmath18 provides an additional handle on gluons .",
    "also similar to the case of pdfs , different observables allow the study of unpolarized collinear ffs , unpolarized tmd ffs , and various spin - momentum correlations in hadronization through yet other tmd ff measurements .",
    "recently , measurements in @xmath18 of two hadrons fragmenting from the same parton have opened up the exploration of dihadron ffs  @xcite .",
    "cross section measurements of inclusive hadron production at rhic  @xcite have already been used to help constrain ffs for charged and neutral pions and kaons , protons , and lambdas  @xcite .",
    "measurements of back - to - back direct photon and charged hadron production to study hadronization in @xmath5@xmath6@xmath5 collisions at rhic have also been performed  @xcite . for a review of ffs ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents charged - pion cross section measurements in polarization - averaged @xmath5+@xmath5 collisions and double - helicity asymmetry measurements in charged pion production in longitudinally polarized proton collisions at @xmath19  gev .",
    "the cross section measurements provide information on charge - separated collinear ffs for pions ; the spin asymmetry measurements are sensitive to the collinear helicity distributions in the proton .",

    "a large set of data was taken in 2009 from polarized @xmath5@xmath6@xmath5 collisions at @xmath20  =  200  gev , and an integrated luminosity of 11.8  pb@xmath21 was analyzed for charged pion production at midrapidity .",
    "the phenix detector is configured with two central arm spectrometers each covering 90@xmath22 in azimuth , @xmath23 in pseudorapidity , two forward muon spectrometers ( not discussed further ) and two sets of detectors to determine collision parameters .    the central arms comprise several tracking layers composed of a drift chamber ( dc ) and pad chambers ( pc ) , a ring - imaging erenkov ( rich ) detector for particle identification , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) . in 2009 , an additional erenkov detector , the hadron - blind detector ( hbd ) , was added to reduce the combinatorial background in low - mass dilepton measurements in heavy ion collisions ; this detector can also be used for charged pion identification .",

    "the bbcs are built with 64 photomultiplier tubes , each coupled to a quartz erenkov radiator .",
    "an offline cut of 30  cm in the distribution of the reconstructed collision point was used for event selection .",
    "additionally , two zero - degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) are located 18  m from the ip along the beam axis , after the rhic beam bending magnets .",
    "each zdc comprises three sections of hadron calorimeter composed of optical fibers for erenkov sampling between layers of tungsten absorber . between the first and second sections",
    "is placed a shower maximum detector ( smd ) , which comprises vertical and horizontal scintillator strips , and is designed to determine the shower maximum of hadronic ( primarily neutron ) showers .",
    "the zdcs are used as a comparison luminosity monitor and , with the smd , to ensure transverse components of the beam polarization are small .",
    "any remaining transverse components of the beam polarization can be determined by the transverse single - spin asymmetry observed for forward neutron production at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the central magnet  @xcite in phenix supplies an axial field for momentum measurements of charged particles .",
    "it comprises two coils , the inner and outer , which can be run independently . to have a field free region in the hbd volume in 2009",
    ", the coils were run in an opposing ` @xmath24 ' configuration . in this configuration , the field strength is near zero for @xmath25  cm , corresponding to the hbd region , and then increases to a peak of 0.35  t around 1  m , with a total magnetic field integral of 0.43 tm .",
    "it is designed such that the field strength is near zero at 2  m , where the first tracking layers are located , and is required to be less than 100  gauss in the region of the rich photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the primary tracking device to determine momentum is the dc  @xcite , located radially between 2 and 2.5  m from the @xmath26-axis in a region of low magnetic field strength .",
    "the transverse component of the track momentum with respect to the beam particle direction is determined based on the angle between the reconstructed track , after bending in the magnetic field , and the straight line from the @xmath26-axis to the track midpoint in the dc .",
    "the first layer of the pc detector  @xcite ( pc1 ) sits behind the dc radially , and is used along with the reconstructed collision vertex to determine the component of the momentum parallel to the @xmath26-axis .",
    "a third layer of the pc ( pc3 ) is located radially directly in front of the emcal , and is used to ensure track quality .",
    "the emcal @xcite was used for energy measurement and triggering .",
    "six of the eight emcal sectors are constructed from lead - scintillator ( pbsc ) towers in a sampling configuration while the remaining two sectors are made of lead - glass ( pbgl ) towers .",
    "the pbsc ( pbgl ) emcal corresponds to 0.85 ( 1.05 ) nuclear interaction lengths .",
    "a high energy trigger , primarily designed for photons , is implemented in the emcal , and was used to select high momentum charged pion candidates .",
    "events were triggered by requiring an emcal cluster with an energy threshold of 1.4  gev in addition to a bbc coincidence trigger .      in 2009 , phenix had two erenkov based charged particle identification detectors : the rich and the hbd . while both were primarily designed to identify electrons , they can also be used to identify pions above @xmath27  4.7  gev/@xmath3 .    the rich @xcite , which uses co@xmath28 as a radiator , allows for the identification of charged pions above @xmath27  4.7  gev/@xmath3 .",
    "the erenkov light is collected by a photomultiplier array on a plane outside of the tracking acceptance after reflection by a pair of focusing spherical mirrors .",

    "the @xmath32 thresholds of erenkov radiation for electrons , pions , and kaons in cf@xmath29 are @xmath33 , and 14  gev/@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the erenkov photons generate photoelectrons on a csi photocathode layer on the first gem foil which are subsequently amplified as they traverse the gem holes and collected in readout pads . because electrons produced in the avalanche can be distributed over more than one readout pad , adjacent pads with charge above the pedestal are grouped together to form a cluster .",
    "the total cluster charge is used as a variable for particle identification .",
    "in addition to erenkov photons , scintillation photons can also be generated by charged particles moving inside the radiator .",
    "the mean number of photons created by scintillation per charged particle ( @xmath101 ) is much smaller than that created through erenkov radiation . at @xmath34  gev/@xmath3",
    ", electrons produce a mean of 20  photoelectrons while the yield for pions has a @xmath35 dependence due to the high threshold momentum .",
    "charged pion candidates are selected based on track quality and particle identification cuts in the erenkov detectors .",

    "further , the track is required to match with hits in the pc3 and emcal .",
    "candidate tracks are required to be associated with an emcal trigger . for the rich ,",
    "we define the variable , @xmath36 , as the total number of photomultipliers that fired within a radius of 11  cm around the projected track position . for charged pion candidates ,",

    "fitting results consistently describe the rising mean number of erenkov photons with @xmath35 .",

    "tracks accidentally associated with scintillation charge on the hbd mainly comprise electrons from photon conversions and from decays of long lived hadrons outside the hbd . as the first tracking detectors sit outside of the magnetic field region ,",
    "the momentum of such electrons created far from the collision point will be incorrectly reconstructed , and then may be incorrectly associated with a track - matching cluster charge in the hbd . applying @xmath35-dependent cuts on the cluster charge ( vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ hbdq ] ) resulted in effective removal of these incorrectly reconstructed electrons .",
    "residual background after applying these cuts is estimated by taking the count ratio of the scintillation to the pion contribution above the charge cut .",
    "compared with the analysis without the hbd , inclusion of the hbd in particle identification resulted in improvement in this background source from @xmath39% to @xmath312% averaged over the @xmath35 range .",
    "the only remaining background that could pass the requirement of a erenkov cluster in the hbd is electrons created prior to the hbd back plane , such as from decays of neutral pions ( dominant ) , @xmath40 electrons ( @xmath41 ) , heavy flavor and vector mesons . as such electrons are generated prior to traversing the magnetic field region , their reconstructed momentum is generally correct .",
    "however , these contributions are suppressed due to small cross sections and small branching ratios in the case of heavy flavor and vector mesons , and small conversion or decay probabilities inside the hbd for electrons from @xmath42 and @xmath40 . in the case of decay electrons ,",
    "decay kinematics further reduces their rate because the @xmath35 distribution of decay electrons is softer than that of the parent particles .",
    "the rate of electrons from the largest contributors ( conversion of @xmath42-decay photons and @xmath42 dalitz decay ) evaluated by these considerations of cross sections and branching ratios amount to @xmath43% of the rate of signal events , while other sources combined are less than 1% .     the rich efficiency as a function of pion @xmath35 above the pion erenkov threshold in the rich .",

    "first , dead areas were identified by comparing hit and projected track distributions and masked .",
    "this was done to obtain pure detector efficiencies , not convoluted with dead area effect .",
    "data were then divided into groups to account for the variation of efficiency with time . within each group ,",
    "the weighted average of the fill - by - fill efficiency was used as an effective efficiency , with the rms assigned as the systematic uncertainty ( 2.8% for the dc , 4.5% for the pc and 1.6% for the hbd ) .    for the rich , using the method described in the previous paragraph",
    "is particularly advantageous as it allows measuring the sharply rising efficiency near the erenkov threshold in a model - independent way .",
    "model based mc simulations do not well describe this efficiency turn - on .",
    "figure  [ richeff ] shows the measured rich efficiency as a function of @xmath35 showing a clear rise above the rich erenkov threshold for pions .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the rich efficiency were determined by comparing with a fermi function used to describe the turn on , and varied from 12% at 5  gev@xmath44 to @xmath101% at high @xmath35 .",
    "the momentum smearing effect caused by finite resolution of measured @xmath35 was corrected by unfolding the measured cross section using mc simulation .",

    "the hardening factors of the @xmath35 spectra , determined @xmath35 bin by @xmath35 bin by taking the ratio between the fitted curves of the unfolded @xmath35 distribution and the measured cross section , were negligible below 8  gev@xmath44 but become significant ( @xmath46% ) at the highest @xmath35 bin due to the sufficiently large @xmath35 resolution . the systematic uncertainty from momentum smearing",
    "was estimated to be  1% by comparing the fitted curves of measured cross section and the re - smeared spectra of unfolded results .",
    "the corrections on the cross section measurements attributed to the momentum smearing effect are large due to the rapidly falling shape of the cross section .",

    "this method exploits the event structure to select a high statistics subset of the data from which the emcal trigger bias is removed .",
    "this subset is composed of events containing a high @xmath35 charged pion in addition to one or more spatially separated particles which fired the emcal trigger . to avoid possible bias from a trigger associated with a nearby particle , a minimum energy cut of 0.2  gev was applied .",
    "these events are divided into two types : type a where the pion does fire the trigger and type b otherwise .",
    "figure  [ trigeff ] shows the spectra for all pions in black and type a  those that fire the trigger  in blue .",

    "this is the case for instance with all the uncertainties related to the efficiency of individual detectors .",
    "a misdetermination of these efficiencies would affect the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross sections identically , hence its effect would not be visible in the ratio . however , the geometric acceptance uncertainties do not cancel for the two charges .",

    "<S> however , the theoretical calculation of the ratio of @xmath0-to-@xmath1 production when considering these scale uncertainties overestimates the measured value , suggesting further investigation of the uncertainties on the charge - separated pion fragmentation functions is needed . due to cancellations of uncertainties in the charge ratio , direct inclusion of these ratio data in future parameterizations should improve constraints on the flavor dependence of quark fragmentation functions to pions . by measuring charge - separated pion asymmetries </S>",
