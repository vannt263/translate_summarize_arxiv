    "old stellar populations preserve a fossil record of a galaxy s early formation and evolution . in the milky way ,",
    "the stellar thick disk and halo have been recognized as the oldest stellar components and have been studied extensively .",
    "stars in the mw thick disk are old ( @xmath18 - 12 gyr ) , and are metal poor when compared to local thin disk stars @xcite .",
    "their chemical composition shows that they are enhanced in @xmath0-elements compared to thin disk stars , suggesting a rapid formation timescale ( @xmath21 gyr ) @xcite .",
    "because stellar thick disks and halos are intrinsically low surface brightness features , they have been observed in detail in only a handful of galaxies .",
    "thick disks have been photometrically detected as an excess flux at large galactic latitudes across a range of hubble types @xcite , as well as detected in star counts using resolved stellar populations from hst @xcite .",
    "three general classes of formation mechanisms have been put forward to explain thick disks . in the first ,",
    "a previously thin disk is kinematically heated . in this scenario , stars form in a thin disk and increase their velocity dispersion with time .",
    "this vertical heating can be rapid , due to interactions and mergers @xcite or gradual due to scattering off giant molecular clouds , spiral arms , and/or dark matter substructure @xcite . in the second formation scenario , stars `` form thick '' with star formation occurring above the midplane of the galaxy @xcite or form with large initial velocity dispersions in massive stellar clusters @xcite . in the final class of models , thick disk stars",
    "are directly accreted from satellite galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that stars in disrupted satellite galaxies can be deposited onto thick disk like orbits @xcite .",
    "while these models were originally developed to explain the origin of the mw thick disk , they should work equally well for thick disks in other massive galaxies .    on the other hand ,",
    "some of these mechanisms are likely to be less effective in lower mass galaxies which have lower density disks , little or no spiral structure , and fewer satellites hosting stars .",
    "lower mass galaxies also have different formation times , environments , and gravitational potentials that may also lead to variation in the mass , age , and metallicity of thick disks of low mass galaxies .    to test these formation models ,",
    "detailed comparisons of thin and thick disk properties are required across a range of galaxy masses .",
    "in particular , the relative ages and chemical enrichment patterns of the thin and thick disks should differ among these formation models .",
    "if the thick disk is just a gradually kinematically heated thin disk , there should be a smooth age and enrichment gradient between the two .",
    "in contrast , if the thick disk is formed from accreted stars we should expect the ages and metallicities of the thin and thick disks to be only weakly correlated .",
    "we may also expect to see variations with the mass of the galaxies , with less massive galaxies being more susceptible to external heating and more massive galaxies being better able to tidally disrupt satellites .",
    "measuring the ages and metallicities of thick disks outside the mw has proved to be challenging .",
    "ages and metallicities can be derived from isochrone fits to thin and thick disk stars resolved with hst , provided that the host galaxies are sufficiently close and oriented edge - on to the line of sight .",
    "the systems studied this way show older populations at large scale heights but little vertical metallicity gradient , at least for the low mass galaxies ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ) which dominate these samples @xcite .    for the systems that are farther away",
    ", only broadband colors have been used to estimate the ages and metallicities of the thick disks .",
    "when thick disks are photometrically detected , they typically have very red colors ( @xmath5 ) @xcite suggestive of an old population .",
    "however , stellar parameters are notoriously difficult to derive from broadband colors due to the age - metallicity degeneracy in the optical colors , and a lack of ir - colors at the low surface brightnesses of the thick disk region .",
    "some progress has been made in measuring the metallicity of the thin disk using high signal - to - noise emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in measuring metallicity gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the emission lines studies can constrain the total chemical enrichment a galaxy has experienced , they tell us nothing about the underlying stellar populations in the galaxies .",
    "emission lines are also unable to provide constraints on the properties of extra - planar stellar populations , which are likely to be dominated by old , dormant stellar populations .    to better measure the ages and metallicities of thick disks in a larger sample of galaxies , we turn to the integrated spectrum of these galaxies and use the lick / ids absorption line system to derive luminosity - weighted stellar population properties .",
    "the lick indices were originally developed for studying older stellar populations @xcite , and have been used extensively in analyzing elliptical galaxies and globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that using a combination of age sensitive ( balmer lines ) and metallicity sensitive (  and fe ) indices , one can lift the age - metallicity degeneracy for a stellar population .",
    "stellar spectral libraries have now been used to create ssp models over a large range of metallicity and age combinations @xcite , including models with variable @xmath0-element enhancement @xcite .",
    "the tools also now exist to calculate expected lick indices for composite stellar populations @xcite .    despite the development of stellar synthesis codes that can be extended to younger stellar populations ,",
    "relatively few studies have attempted to observe lick indices in disk galaxies .",
    "studies using tunable filters have been able to detect mg and fe index gradients in disks @xcite , but have not been combined with measurements of age - sensitive indices .",
    "studies of disk systems have tended to focus on the high surface brightness bulge components @xcite , and fail to reach very far into the disks . in the most extensive study observing lick indices in disk galaxies , @xcite observed lick indices in 8 galaxy disks , including several late - type galaxies out to @xmath11 scale length .",
    "these observations probed to @xmath11 scale length .",
    "however , all of these galaxies were fairly face - on , preventing thick and thin disk components from being separated .    in this paper , we target regions of edge - on galaxies that are dominated by either the stellar thick disk and thin components .",
    "we then compare ages and metallicities derived from lick indices both between the two components and from galaxy - to - galaxy .",
    "the original sample of 49 galaxies was selected from the flat galaxy catalog @xcite and imaged in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this imaging to demonstrate the ubiquity of thick disks around late - type galaxies .",
    "we have since used two - dimensional decompositions of the galaxy images to measure structural parameters for the thick and thin disks @xcite .",
    "we have also measured kinematic properties of the thick and thin disks using gmos on the gemini telescopes @xcite .    for this study , we selected a subset of galaxies where the photometric decompositions suggested we would be able to isolate thin and thick disk regions while obtaining adequate signal .",
    "this limits us to observing predominantly lower - mass galaxies , as @xcite found these are the galaxies with proportionally larger thick disks .",
    "observations were made using the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the arc 3.5 meter telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) between june 2003 and february 2006 during a total of 34 half - nights of observing .",
    "although the telescope aperture is much smaller than used for previous studies ( 3.5 m compared to 8 m ) , we were able to reach the needed signal - to - noise using a novel slit design .",
    "spectroscopy of extended low surface brightness objects has traditionally been limited by the need to collect a large number of photons while maintaining adequate spectral resolution . however , since the lick indices are defined at low spectral resolution ( @xmath9  ) and cover a limited wavelength range , it is possible to capture more photons by using a much wider slit to feed a spectrograph with a higher resolution grating .",
    "we therefore built a custom 5x 4@xmath10 slit to allow the largest possible amount of light to reach the detector .",
    "on the blue side , we used a grating with 1200 lines / mm and on the red side , 830 lines / mm . the resulting spectral resolution was 4.9(7.1 )   fwhm as measured from calibration lamps for the blue(red ) chip .",
    "the blue chip gave wavelength coverage from 4390 - 5430   sufficient to measure the age sensitive @xmath11  and metallicity sensitive mg , fe5270 , and fe5335 lick indices .",
    "the red side covered 6140 - 7860   , which allowed us to measure the strength of the @xmath12  emission line .",
    "the ccds were binned by 2 in the spectral direction to reduce read noise .",
    "combining a large aperture slit with a high resolution grating is an unconventional setup , but the increased throughput of the wide slit allows us to observe the low surface brightness regions where the thick disk dominates",
    ".    the slit camera on dis allowed us to accurately place the slit by centroiding nearby bright stars .",
    "the slit camera has a plate - scale of 0.298 /pixel , and we were typically able to place the slit within 1 pixel of our target region .",
    "slit camera images were taken throughout long exposures to ensure accurate tracking .",
    "for each galaxy , we gathered spectra at the midplane as well as at several vertical scale heights above the midplane where photometric decompositions imply the majority of flux should be supplied by the thick disk component .",
    "images of the slit placement are shown in figure  [ slit_place ] and the observation log is listed in table  [ fgc_obs ] .",
    "we found that there were several prominent skylines near the relevant indices that would slowly fade for several hours after sunset .",
    "most problematic was a skyline of oh at 5200  , which often contaminated the  index . to avoid the skylines , we took advantage of the apo 3.5 m scheduling system which allocates observations in half - night intervals and scheduled most of our observations for the second half of the night .",

    "stellar spectra were used to correct the spatial distortions ( tilt ) in the observations .",
    "observations of standard stars and standard atmospheric extinction curves were used to flux calibrate the spectra .",
    "few of the observations were made in photometric conditions , thus our flux calibration is primarily used as a first order removal of the instrumental sensitivity profile . because we are primarily interested in measuring equivalent widths , the exact flux normalization is not crucial .",
    "the sky was subtracted using a second order polynomial fit to regions dominated by the sky .",
    "the spectra were finally corrected for motion relative to the local standard of rest , scaled to a common flux level , spatially aligned , and combined rejecting cosmic ray hits .",

    "we therefore broaden our blue spectra with a gaussian kernel with @xmath14 to match the lick system resolution .",
    "systematic and rotational velocities were removed by cross - correlating a ( logarithmically - binned ) stellar template plus gaussian emission lines .",
    "the shifts were accurate to within 1 pixel ( @xmath15  ) .",
    "the midplane rotation curve was used for both the midplane and offplane spectra , as any difference between the two should be small at our resolution @xcite .    after the 2d spectra were broadened to match the lick resolution , any foreground stars were masked and 1d spectra were extracted by summing in the spatial direction . for both the midplane and offplane , we extracted spectra from the region of @xmath161 scale length ( @xmath17 ) , as measured in @xcite .",
    "we tested how the snr of our spectra affects the accuracy of the measured lick indices . adding artificial noise to template stellar spectra , we find the rms error in a measured lick index scales with s / n as @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , to achieve an lick ew uncertainty of @xmath19  requires a snr of @xmath20 per  , which agrees with previous determinations by @xcite .    throughout our analysis , we will calculate the uncertainties in our derived ages and metallicities using the snr of the extracted spectra . as an additional check",
    ", we have extracted 1d spectra from @xmath21 and @xmath22 to find the variance in the lick indices from one side of the galaxy to the other and note cases where there are large discrepancies .",
    "this procedure allows us to flag systems where systematic errors are likely to dominate over random uncertainties .",
    "while we have matched the lick resolution reported in @xcite , this is not enough to ensure that we are on the lick system .",
    "because the lick indices were originally defined from spectra that had not been flux - calibrated , additional corrections are needed .",
    "to do so , we made 144 observations of 37 unique lick standard stars .",
    "stars for which we have repeat observations have a mean rms error of 0.09   for each index .",
    "our standard star ews are compared to values listed in @xcite , and are shown in figure  [ resids2 ] .",
    "the derived zero point corrections are listed in table  [ zp_table ] . in general , the agreement is quite good , with a typical gaussian scatter of 0.26   and little systematic offset .",
    "the notable exception is for , for which the apo system measures low ew for metal rich systems with @xmath23  .",
    "we do not explicitly correct for this offset as we are observing metal poor galaxies which have  indices @xmath24  .",
    "we also compare our standard star ews with stars in common with @xcite and find a spread of 0.2 - 0.4  .",
    "@xcite points out that measurements of ews of bright stars are disturbingly inconsistent , and that there can be surprisingly large variations between observations .",

    "the ellipticals were observed when light cloud cover made observing faint regions of disks impossible , or during brief periods when the primary targets were not visible .",
    "we observed 9 galaxies in common with @xcite listed in table  [ ell_obs ] .",
    "our indices are not directly comparable to the ones listed in @xcite , as we used our large 5  slit which samples more flux from the outer regions of the galaxies , and we have not replicated the corrections for velocity dispersion and emission line fill - in as done in @xcite .",
    "thus , some amount of scatter is expected .",
    "the residuals between our measurements and those in @xcite are plotted in figure  [ ell_resids ] . for the h@xmath25 , , and fe 5270 indices",
    ", we measure rms scatters of 0.16 - 0.31   around the @xcite values .",
    "there is a much larger scatter for fe 5335 because the feature approaches the dis dichroic cut - off for galaxies with a redshift greater than 4000  km  s@xmath4 and becomes very low signal - to - noise .",
    "unlike observations of gas - poor ellipticals and globular clusters , we must remove any emission lines that contaminate the index passbands before we can derive ages and metallicities from the absorption features .",
    "the removal of emission lines is not trivial .",
    "we would like to remove the @xmath11  emission , but to do so we would need to know the underlying shape of the stellar continuum .",
    "this shape in turn depends strongly on the stellar population s age and metallicity , which is what we set out to measure .",
    "we therefore must turn to other parts of the spectrum to estimate the amount of @xmath11  emission .",
    "lick indices , particularly @xmath11 , are often contaminated with emission lines . @xcite",
    "popularized using the correction @xmath11@xmath26=0.7[oiii]@xmath275007 .",
    "this correction was derived by fitting a stellar template to the underlying spectrum of their elliptical galaxies to isolate the emission feature .",
    "unfortunately , the shape of the template can determine the magnitude of the emission correction and the ratio of @xmath28}$ ] is highly metallicity sensitive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making this correction inappropriate for low metallicity systems with varying stellar ages .",
    "@xcite make a correction by fitting a gaussian to the emission peak inside the @xmath11  lick index .",
    "this correction probably underestimates the @xmath11  correction since the gaussian fit will not be sensitive to the fraction of @xmath11  emission that has filled the absorption feature .",
    "this correction is also very sensitive to the resolution of the measured spectrum . when we try to fit a gaussian to the emission feature after broadening , we find that the correction is 0.4   smaller than when we make the correction before broadening .",
    "@xcite takes the most extreme measure of masking regions where the spectrum is contaminated by emission lines .    using the [ oiii ] emission line to estimate @xmath11  is a fine approximation when the @xmath11  emission correction is small , as in elliptical galaxy spectra",
    "however , our midplane spectra are clearly dominated by the @xmath11  emission ( figure  [ example_spec ] ) , and we must use a more accurate technique to remove the emission . to do so , we measure the ew of the @xmath12  emission line from the spectra taken simultaneously with the red dis spectrograph and use this to estimate the ew of the @xmath11  emission line .",
    "our procedure for removing the @xmath11  emission is as follows .",
    "we first assume case b recombination with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this correction is used in @xcite and @xcite when measuring lick indices in elliptical galaxies . however , because the @xmath12  and @xmath11  emission lines were measured on different ccds , we are hesitant to use the measured flux ratios . while both ccds are calibrated using the same flux standard stars , the subsequent scaling and co - adding of frames was done independently and could skew the absolute flux calibration between the two .",
    "instead , we make corrections based on equivalent widths as follows .",
    "the definition of the ew is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the spectrum in the index passband and @xmath32 is the continuum spectrum calculated from the flanking pseudo - continuum regions .",
    "our goal is to remove the contaminating emission feature to recover the equivalent - width of the underlying lick absorption feature .",
    "@xmath33    in the case where the continuum is constant , the ew from the emission alone is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the integrated flux in the emission line and @xmath32 is the continuum level .",
    "we can then write the expected ew ratio for the balmer emission lines as @xmath36 this in turn can be modified to account for differential extinction between the stars and hii regions .",
    "@xmath37    @xcite lists @xmath38 and finds that @xmath39 .",
    "the difference in reddening is due to the geometrically clumpy distribution of hii regions compared to the smoother distribution of stars .",
    "finally , we get the relation @xmath40    for the offplane spectra , we assume there is negligible dust extinction , a fairly flat continuum level ( @xmath41 ) , and case b recombination , resulting in the standard correction of @xmath42 with @xmath43 . in the case of the midplane spectra , there is a younger bluer stellar population and the possibility of dust extinction .",
    "we adopt case b recombination , a continuum ratio of 1.1 , and @xmath44 resulting in @xmath45 . our value of @xmath46 is lower than typical values for the centers of edge - on disks ( @xcite find @xmath47 in an edge - on disk similar to our sample galaxies ) ,",
    "however , light off the midplane and at larger radii experience significantly less extinction .",
    "for elliptical galaxies identified as dusty , @xcite adopt a correction of @xmath48 .",
    "these adopted corrections give results consistent with what we expect from the broadband colors and ssp models .",
    "most of the corrected @xmath11lick ews fall within the range expected from the model grids , and we find younger ages where the integrated light is blue and older ages where it is red . in  [ elcorr ] , we calculate how a 10% change in our adopted value of @xmath49 would propagate to the derived ages and metallicities .",
    "this uncertainty corresponds to extinction values @xmath50 or continuum ratios @xmath51 .    while we consider how dust affects the emission line ew ratios , the lick absorption features themselves are fairly insensitive to dust @xcite and require no extra corrections even if the galaxies are dusty .",

    "to convert our measured indices to ages we start with the model grids of @xcite and interpolate them to a finer grid with age steps of @xmath62 gyr and metallicity steps of @xmath63[z / h]=0.01 .",
    "we exclude the very young age grid points ( age @xmath64 gyr ) as the lick indices expected for such young ages are degenerate with older populations . to calculate the uncertainties , we interpolate ages and metallicities for 100 lick index pairs distributed according to the equivalent width uncertainties .",
    "we also test for possible systematic errors caused by incorrect emission line corrections and calculate how a 10% error in the emission line correction for h@xmath25 propagates to errors in age and metallicity .",
    "figure  [ grid1 ] shows the lick indices measured for each of our galaxies , placed on the model grids of @xcite , assuming no @xmath0-enhancement . for each galaxy",
    ", we calculate the age and metallicity by interpolating onto grids of @xmath11 + , @xmath11+fe 5270 , and @xmath11+fe 5335 .",
    "three of the galaxies ( fgc 1948 , 2369 , and 2548 ) have lick indices that consistently fall far outside the model grids .",
    "this is not surprising , as the offplane snr for fgc 1948 and 2369 were so low we should not have expected to measure lick indices ( table  [ lick_table ] ) , and fgc 2548 is only on the cusp of having adequate snr . for the remaining six galaxies , we plot the average interpolated ages and metallicities for the midplane and offplane in figure  [ age_met ] and plot cumulative distributions of the age and metallicity differences between the thin and thick disk components in figure  [ hists ] . for consistency , we use only the metallicities measured from the  and fe 5270 indices because several galaxies have very low snr at the fe 5335 index .    for the 6 galaxies with high snr , we find the thick disks have a median age of 7.2 gyr and metallicity of [ z / h]=-0.6 .",
    "the thin disks have a similar median metallicity as expected for their low mass , but are uniformly much younger , with a median age of 4.6 gyr . this age determination for the thin disk",
    "is derived after making very large emission line corrections and represents a flux - weighted average of all the stars within a radius of one scale length .",
    "it is certainly possible that the oldest central regions of the thin disk contain stars whose ages are similar to those of the thick disks .",

    "the observations of the midplane of fgc 1440 were deep enough that we can extract radial gradients of the lick indices .",
    "we extracted spectra by binning 6.3  spatially in a sliding region across the galaxy , and moving the observations onto the lick system as before .",
    "this gives us a snr of 200 in the central regions of the galaxy and 50 at 1.3 @xmath17 .",
    "the radial variation of the lick indices along with the interpolated ages and metallicities are plotted in figures  [ rad_ind ] and  [ rad_age ] .",
    "the @xmath11 , , and fe 5270 indices have radial gradients of 2.8 , -1.5 , and -1.3 /@xmath17 respectively .",
    "these gradients are fairly large for pure disk systems .",
    "@xcite finds similar gradients with similar magnitudes in four late - type face - on systems .",
    "@xcite also find strong radial gradients , but attribute them to the transition between bulge and disk dominated regions of their galaxies .",
    "the gradients in the lick indices are consistent with a large age gradient , with the central region of fgc  1440 having an ssp age of @xmath65 gyr dropping to 2 gyr after one scale length .",
    "the metallicity gradients , however , are slightly ambiguous .",
    "the metallicity measured from the  index shows a mostly flat radial gradient , with a large drop on only one side of the galaxy . on the other hand",
    "the fe  5270 index shows a decreasing metallicity on both sides of the galaxy . fitting a line to the radial data , we find that the  index has a metallicity gradient of @xmath66 dex/@xmath17 . if we restrict the fit to the region inside one scale length , the  metallicity gradient is consistent with zero .",
    "the fe  5270 index reveals a much steeper gradient of @xmath67 dex/@xmath17 .",
    "this seems to imply that there is a radially changing level of @xmath0-enhancement throughout the galaxy , with the central regions being close to solar composition and the outer regions becoming more @xmath0-enhanced , thereby inflating the metallicity measured from . in figure",
    "[ rad_age ] , we plot the best fitting @xmath0-element enhancement and it does appear that the outer regions are @xmath0-enhanced compared to the central region which is best fit with a nearly solar chemical composition .",
    "these @xmath0-element measurements should be regarded with caution , as we have fit a model with three free parameters ( age , metallicity , and @xmath0 composition ) using only three measurements ( @xmath11 , , and fe 5270 ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that we should adopt a radially varying emission line correction .",
    "this seems likely , as fgc 1440 hosts a dust lane which becomes less prominent with radius .",
    "while we can not draw broad conclusions based on a single galaxy , it is clear we detect stronger radial gradients than have been found in other disk systems .",
    "this is even more surprising given that edge - on projection effects should act to smooth any radial population gradients we observe .",
    "we discuss these results further in  [ rcg ] .",
    "both the midplane and offplane have prominent emission lines . for the midplane spectra",
    ", we applied @xmath11  corrections that had an average of 4.9  , while the offplane corrections had an average of 2.2  . if we had not take reddening or continuum shape into account and naively used just the case b recombination correction for both the midplane and offplane , we would have derive slightly younger ages for the midplane .",
    "this simple correction would place many of the observations near the upper edges of the model grids , suggesting we were under correcting . if instead we assume an even higher amount of dust extinction for the midplane , several of the thin and thick disks",
    "would then have similar ssp ages .",
    "however , it would take fairly extreme levels of dust extinction to drive all of the thin disks to have similar ages as the thick disks .",
    "the blue broad - band colors for these galaxies are inconsistent with such high levels of dust .    propagating an uncertainty of @xmath68 in the @xmath11  emission correction results in a median @xmath690.2 dex shift in metallicity and @xmath161.9 gyr in age for the midplane and @xmath690.1 dex and @xmath162.8 gyr for the offplane .",
    "while we have placed our longslits at regions that should be dominated by the thin or thick components , we expect some thick disk stars to be present in the midplane and vice - versa . using the photometric fits in @xcite",
    ", we find that our midplane observations typically contain @xmath120% thick disk flux , while the offplane observations have a flux contribution of @xmath125% from the thin disk .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ slit_place ] , we did not have large gaps between our slit positions .",
    "observations made in poor seeing conditions might therefore experience extra cross - contamination as light from the midplane could be scattered into the offplane slit position .",
    "this should not be a major problem as we avoided making offplane observations during the worst seeing conditions , but could slightly increase the amount of expected cross - contamination .",
    "@xcite study how lick indices and their derived ssp ages and metallicities are affected when there are multiple stellar populations present .",
    "they find that the derived ages are very sensitive to the youngest stars present , while the metallicity measures are predominantly influenced by any older population .",
    "contamination could therefore explain the similar metallicities we measure for the thin and thick disk stars .",
    "however , resolved stellar population studies have found small vertical metallicity gradients in low mass galaxies as well @xcite .",
    "if enough thick disk stars contaminate the midplane , our ssp derived metallicities will be slightly biased towards those of the older population , even in the young midplane . of course",
    ", it is also possible that these low mass galaxies have simply not undergone substantial star formation episodes and thus have not chemically enriched the thin disks above the level of the thick disk .",
    "overall , the effects of cross - contamination would lead us to underestimate the true metallicity differences between the thin and thick disks , but to overestimate the flux - weighted age differences .      while we are measuring ssp - equivalent ages and metallicities , it is fairly obvious that the midplanes of disk galaxies have undergone multiple epochs of star formation and are not well described by a single age and metallicity .",
    "our ages and metallicities are thus best interpreted as flux - weighted averages across the extracted radial region , particularly for our midplane spectra where we have evidence for very steep radial age gradients in some systems . because we are forced to bin our spectra over a large spatial region to reach adequate snr , we include flux from the younger outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "our midplane ages should probably be interpreted as minimums , as the central region is undoubtedly older than the flux averaged measure we report .",
    "many spectroscopic observations of elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges have found stellar populations that have systematic differences between the metallicity calculated from the  index compared to the fe indices .",
    "this systematic shift is usually interpreted as being caused by a stellar population that is significantly enhanced with @xmath0-elements compared to the spectra that were used in building the lick model grids .",
    "such an enhancement is expected for stellar populations that form rapidly ( @xmath70 gyr ) and that are primarily enriched by type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "enhancements in @xmath0-elements are often seen in elliptical galaxies @xcite , as well as in local mw thick disk stars @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in our sample are all fairly low mass and therefore also low metallicity . in the low metallicity regime ,",
    "the signature of @xmath0-element enhancement becomes weaker in the lick indices . unlike massive elliptical galaxies where the metallicity indicators can show systematic offsets of @xmath10.5 dex for an @xmath0-enhanced population , our galaxies are all sub - solar metallicity and",
    "thus would show little bias even if they are @xmath0-enhanced .",
    "if we used model ssp grids with [ @xmath0/fe]=0.3 , our derived metallicities would change by only @xmath71 dex .",
    "we are hesitant to use our data to fit the @xmath0-element enhancement level .",
    "if we forge ahead and do so , we find considerable spread between the metallicities returned , but neither the thin or thick disk have systematically larger metallicities returned from the  index , as we would expect if the stars were @xmath0-enhanced .",
    "however , given the small expected offset and lower snr than available for elliptical galaxy spectra , we do not consider this a significant result , and include it here only for completeness .",
    "measuring accurate ages for thick disk stars has been done in relatively few systems . in the mw ,",
    "stars that are kinematically identified as thick disk stars typically have ages greater than 8 gyr @xcite .",
    "hst studies of resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies show the offplane regions are dominated by old stars .",
    "@xcite find that in 8 galaxies the offplane rgb stars have ages in the range of 2 - 6 gyr .",
    "similarly , @xcite uses the ratio of rgb and agb stars to find ages of thick disks in a sample of 4 galaxies to be older than 3 gyr .",
    "our measured thick disk ssp ages fall between 3.8 and 10.9 gyr with a median age of 7.1 gyr , consistent with these other studies that show thick disks to be dominated by ancient stars .",
    "many of our thick disks appear to be more metal rich than the embedded thin disks .",
    "this counter - intuitive result is probably due to the flux weighted nature of our measurement .",
    "the young , metal - poor outer regions dilute the true central ages and metallicities of the thin disks .",
    "thick disk metallicities have only been measured for a handful of systems .",
    "mw thick disk stars typically have metallicities in the range [ fe / h]@xmath72 to -0.2 , with the highest metallicity thick disk stars possibly reaching solar values @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with comparing to the mw thick disk is that the observed mw properties are of thick disk stars near the solar radius , while we have only been able to measure thick disk properties near the central regions of the galaxies .",
    "fortunately there are signs that the mw thick disk has relatively small age and metallicity gradients @xcite .",
    "constraints of thick disk metallicities have also been derived from hst studies imaging resolved stars .",
    "@xcite used acs images of 6 nearby edge - on disks to constrain vertical gradients in the stellar populations using the color and distribution of agb and rgb stars .",
    "the older rgb stars have a systematically larger scale height compared to the younger agb and main sequence stars .",
    "they find little to no metallicity gradients in the thick disk stars in their systems , with the metallicities of the thick disks peaked around [ fe / h]@xmath73 .",
    "this is slightly more metal poor than the measurements we have for our thick disks .",
    "however , the offset is unlikely to be significant , given that the @xcite study is able to study a cleaner sample of thick disk stars by reaching higher vertical heights which reducing the contamination of thin disk stars .",
    "like the data presented here , @xcite only studies lower mass systems , limiting the amplitude of any possible metallicity gradient due to the low metallicity of the midplane . using similar hst observations",
    ", @xcite finds that thick disk stars in 4 edge - on galaxies have [ fe / h ] between -1.0 and -0.78 , again very similar to the metallicities we find .    in figure",
    "[ comp ] , we compare our thin disk metallicities to the low mass sample in @xcite and the large sdss sample of @xcite .",
    "we also compare our thick disk values to thick disk and halo samples presented in @xcite , and @xcite . in cases where the authors presented values of log(o / h)+12",
    ", we converted to [ fe / h ] assuming log(o / h)@xmath74 + 12=8.69 and [ fe / o]=0 .",
    "we also plot the midplane nebular abundances for our galaxies calculated from the s2n2 calibrator @xcite . with the exception of a few outliers , our measured metallicities are consistent with metallicities measured in similar systems .",
    "recently , @xcite have questioned if the milky way thick disk is a unique component or simply an extension of the thin disk that has non - gaussian metallicity and velocity distributions @xcite .",
    "they cite a lack of correlation between velocity and metallicity in large sdss samples as a major problem for traditional disk decompositions and rule out a  traditional \" two - disk model at the 8@xmath75 level .",
    "unfortunately , the model @xcite rule out is not applicable to their observations . in particular , they model 1,142 stars observed in the region @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite correctly assume the observations will contain a similar number of thin and thick disk stars , however they do not use a realistic thin disk component .",
    "the thin disk stars are modeled as having an asymmetric drift of 9  km  s@xmath4and [ fe / h]=-0.50 with a spread of 0.04 dex ( their figure  16 ) .",
    "these parameters would be appropriate for modeling nearby thin disk stars , but they are observing stars 3 - 4 thin disk scale heights above the galactic plane . at this large height , only the kinematically hottest thin disk stars will be present in the sample , and one should expect a much larger velocity lag than observed in local cooler thin disk stars .",
    "@xcite show that the hottest local disk stars are the oldest and that the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) for local stars has large intrinsic dispersion at large ages ( @xmath77 dex ) .",
    "this large metallicity dispersion is probably a result of radial migration of the older high velocity dispersion stars @xcite .",
    "if the offplane thin disk stars are assumed to be similar to older local thin disk stars ( i.e. , kinematically hot with a broad metallicity distribution and larger asymmetric drift ) , their properties should well match sdss observations of regions at large scale height . specifically , there should be little correlation between kinematics and metallicity despite the mixture of thin and thick disk stars .",
    "this revised model is consistent with the observations of thick disks presented here and elsewhere @xcite that find stars at large scale heights are a significantly older population than those found near the midplane .",
    "the level of @xmath0-enhancement can be a major clue to the formation process of a stellar population . if @xmath0-enhanced , it is a sign that a stellar population has been enriched mostly over a short time period by type ii sne , whereas stars with solar composition formed over an extended period and have been enriched by both type ii and type ia sne .",
    "numerous papers have found that mw thick disk stars are enhanced in @xmath0-elements compared to thin disk stars at similar total metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , we do not have the snr to definitively say if our thick disks are @xmath0-enhanced , due to the overall low metallicities of our target galaxies .      using a sample of @xmath781000 sdss images of edge - on disk galaxies , @xcite examine the faint halo that appears",
    "when the images are stacked .",
    "this extended halo has anomalous colors , requiring stars that are either metal rich or have a bottom heavy imf @xcite .",
    "we find no such anomalies with the thick disks we observe spectroscopically , as most of them fall on stellar synthesis model grids using standard imfs and metallicities .",
    "the few galaxies where we measure lick indices that are inconsistent with the ssp models can easily be explained as spurious measurements caused by low snr , and do not require exotic stellar populations .",
    "@xcite observed broadband colors for a large sample of galaxies and found that the radial gradients were predominantly caused by age gradients in the stellar populations . by averaging their sample together",
    ", they found a metallicity gradient , but broadband sensitivity to dust makes this a measurement in individual galaxies .",
    "their work has been expanded on by @xcite , who found both metallicity and age gradients are stronger in the inner regions of galaxies , and that galaxies with strong age gradients had smaller metallicity gradients .",
    "the lick indices ability to lift the age - metallicity degeneracy , and relative insensitivity to dust makes it much easier to quantify how much of the radial color gradients in disk galaxies are due to age versus metallicity changes .    in one of the only study that has explicitly targeted lick indices in the disk - dominated regions of galaxies , @xcite detect age gradients in only 2 of their 8 galaxies , and find strong negative metallicity gradients in 4 .",
    "the age gradients in @xcite are also rather small ( -0.5 and -1.3 gyr/@xmath17 ) .",
    "our measurements of fgc 1440 show a much steeper age gradient , with the ssp age dropping by @xmath79 gyr over one scale length .",
    "@xcite use the sauron integral field unit spectrograph to measure lick index strengths across the face of 18 late - type disk galaxies .",
    "they find in general @xmath11  increasing with radius and the metal sensitive lines decreasing with radius .",
    "the sauron observations show a very wide range of galaxy - to - galaxy radial behavior , the most extreme are consistent with the strong gradients we find in fgc 1440 .",
    "our finding that the thin disk of fgc 1440 might have stellar populations of near solar composition and be @xmath0-enhanced at larger radii is puzzling .",
    "looking at the transition between bulge and disk dominated regions , @xcite finds that the central bulges are either solar - composition or @xmath0-enhanced , with little to no @xmath0-enhancement in the disks . with the presence of old thick disks in all of the galaxies",
    ", we would expect the galaxies to have experienced plenty of chemical evolution and enrichment from sne ia .",
    "instead , the outer regions of fgc 1440 are @xmath0-enhanced , suggesting that the central region of the galaxy has undergone extended chemical enrichment , while the outer regions have not , despite being surrounded by old thick disk stars .",
    "this could be a sign that the thick disk stars in fgc 1440 have been recently accreted , and thus have not contributed to the chemical enrichment the galaxy .",
    "another possibility is that the central region of the galaxy is the only place where the gravitational potential is deep enough to retain sn ejecta , and the outer disk has historically suffered from sn blow - out and failed to retain metal enriched gas .",
    "another possibility is that the luminosity - weighted metallicity in the outer disk is dominated by enrichment from the latest burst of star - formation which has @xmath0-enhanced the region .",
    "we have spectroscopically confirmed that the thick disks observed in edge - on late type galaxies are old , metal - poor stellar populations , analogous to the thick disk stars seen in the mw and nearby edge - on systems .",
    "this is the first time ages and metallicities of thick disks have been measured in unresolved stellar populations . because all of our targets are fairly low mass , we are unable to detect any significant differences between thin disk and thick disk metallicities . after correcting for emission line contamination ,",
    "the thin disks in our sample are found to be quite young , with strong radial age gradients .",
    "we fail to detect any significant trend for thick disk stars to be enhanced in @xmath0-elements compared to their thin disks which is a defining characteristic of the mw thick disk .",
    "our failure to observe @xmath0-enhancements is most likely a result of our sample being dominated by low - mass and therefore low metallicity galaxies , for which solar and @xmath0-enhanced models are similar .    for one galaxy in our sample",
