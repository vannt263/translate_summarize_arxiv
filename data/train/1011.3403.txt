    "<S> in the previous paper we have argued that the lhc data on multiplicity , average transverse momentum , and charged particle transverse momentum distributions are well described with minimal modeling in terms of a saturation scale @xmath0 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 spectra should exhibit geometric scaling . in this short note </S>",
    "<S> we show that recently released cms data at @xmath2 and @xmath3  tev fall on a universal curve when plotted in terms of suitably defined scaling variable @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> in ref.@xcite we argued that the lhc data can be naturally described by assuming that particles in pp high energy collisions are produced from a saturated gluonic matter characterized by a saturation scale @xmath5 where @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 is the energy scale that depends on the observable in question . </S>",
    "<S> power @xmath8 is related to the growth of the gluon distribution in proton with decreasing bjorken @xmath9 as measured at hera @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior has a natural explanation within the theory of saturation and the color glass condensate . for details and relevant references we refer the reader to ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in ref.@xcite we have argued that if the saturation momentum is the only scale that controls @xmath1 distributions , on dimensional grounds , these distributions should have a geometrical scaling @xcite @xmath10     and scaling variable @xmath4 for three choices of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> function @xmath13 is a _ universal _ , _ energy independent _ , dimensionless function of dimensionless scaling variable@xmath14 where @xmath15 ( in ref.@xcite @xmath16 if all energy scales are in gev ) .    at the time when ref.@xcite was published the @xmath1 distributions measured by cms @xcite have not been publicly accessible yet . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we had to perform our analysis using tsallis parametrizations of the cms data . </S>",
    "<S> now , when @xmath1 distributions are available from the durham reaction data base @xcite , we repeat our analysis on the real data . in fig.[gs ] we plot @xmath17 for full cms ( pseudo)rapidity range @xmath18 firstly as a function of @xmath19 ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath20 ) and then as a function of scaling variable @xmath4 for three choices of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that indeed the data follow the universal curve exhibiting geometric scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of scaling depends on the actual value of @xmath21 and is best for the larger values shown . </S>",
    "<S> for all three of choices examined in this note , the quality is very impressive . </S>",
    "<S> similar conclusion can be drawn for the ua1 data on @xmath22 @xcite as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it should be noted that in evolution equations , the parameter @xmath21 is of order @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation between @xmath32 and @xmath21 is therefore of order @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us an estimate of the uncertainty of our considerations due to higher order effects . </S>",
    "<S> a proper treatment that builds in lograrithmic corrections and corrections due to impact parameter may be expected to generate deviations from our results . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite exceptional that our naive considerations work so well .    in the meantime , after the publication of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , other authors have undertaken a more ambitious task to calculate particle spectra from the models based on color glass condensate that incorporate both hera and rhic data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies show indeed that saturated gluonic matter dominates particle production in @xmath34p collisions at small bjorken @xmath9 and in heavy ion and pp collisions at high energies . </S>",
