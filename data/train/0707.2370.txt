    "we shall calculate the thermal equilibration rate between fermi - dirac electrons and maxwell - boltzmann ions in a hot , fully ionized plasma .",
    "we shall do so _ exactly _ to leading and next - to - leading order in the plasma number density , and to all orders in the electron fugacity , thereby providing an essentially exact result for weakly to moderately coupled plasmas .",
    "we shall work out this problem for two reasons .",
    "first , the result is new and is needed in some applications .",
    "second , our previous treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite of the plasma stopping power was performed in great generality , and the basic idea behind the dimensional continuation method , a somewhat subtle analytic tool that we employ , may have gotten lost in all the details .",
    "we shall use this opportunity of a simpler and specific case to treat the method in a pedagogical fashion and to explain it clearly  @xcite .",
    "physical systems often contain disparate length or energy scales .",
    "for example , plasma physics involves hard collisions at short distances  ultraviolet physics ; and soft interactions at large distances entailing collective effects  infrared physics .",
    "the resulting interplay of short and long distances produces the familiar coulomb logarithm . for the electron - ion temperature equilibration rate , and for other such processes involving disparate scales",
    ", it is rather easy to calculate the leading contribution , namely the overall factor in front of this logarithm .",
    "although the order of magnitude of this leading order term can usually be obtained from simple dimensional analysis alone , calculating the additional dimensionless factor inside the logarithm , the sub - leading term , is quite difficult .",
    "a new method  @xcite employing dimensional continuation has been introduced to deal with such problems , a method that makes the computation of the sub - leading as well as the leading contributions tractable .",
    "this method is based on tested principles of quantum field theory constructed over the last fifty years , and it has been used successfully to calculate well measured phenomena such as the lamb shift  @xcite , often with much more ease than traditional methods .",
    "most recently , the method has been exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite by brown , preston , and singleton ( bps ) to provide an extensive treatment of the charged particle stopping power in a plasma , the energy loss per unit distance @xmath0 of the charged projectile .",
    "one of the topics treated in bps was the rate at which elections and ions in a spatially homogeneous plasma , starting with different temperatures , come into thermal equilibrium at a common temperature .",
    "here we shall extend this work to include the case in which the electron fugacity is sufficiently large that the electrons must be treated with a degenerate fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this is the case in which pauli blocking becomes of some importance .",
    "the degeneracy effects that we treat here come into play as the plasma temperature is lowered .",
    "we shall calculate the rate for the general case in which the electrons are described by a fermi - dirac distribution , with no approximations being made to this distribution .",
    "that is , we shall perform the calculation exactly to all orders in the electron fugacity @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reciprocal of the electron temperature and @xmath3 is the electron chemical potential .",
    "note that we shall always measure temperature in energy units so that @xmath3 does indeed have the correct units of energy .",
    "we shall assume that the plasma is at most moderately coupled , which often implies that the degeneracy corrections are not large .",
    "nonetheless , we shall work out the general case since this is just as easy as treating the case of only mild degeneracy , and the general case may prove to have some application .",
    "a plasma is seldom formed in thermal equilibrium ; for example , a laser preferentially heats the light electrons rather than the heavy ions . while a non - equilibrium plasma will of course eventually thermalize",
    ", it does so in several stages .",
    "first , the electrons rapidly equilibrate among themselves to a common temperature @xmath4 . then",
    ", somewhat less rapidly , all the various ions equilibrate to a common temperature @xmath5 .",
    "finally , the electrons and ions begin the process of thermal equilibration , with the electrons delivering their energy density to the ions at a rate @xmath6 we shall calculate the rate coefficient @xmath7 in the following sections .",
    "however , it is useful to examine this result now , the rate coefficient in the form ( [ donerdeal ] ) , which we display below for convenience .",
    "this expression for @xmath7 is exact to all orders in the electron fugacity , but valid only in a temperature regime in which the short - distance scattering is described by the quantum - mechanical first born approximation : @xmath8   & & \\hskip2 cm     + \\ , \\frac{1}{2 }    \\sum_{l=1}^\\infty ( -1)^{l+1 }   \\ln\\{l+1\\}\\ ,   e^{l\\beta_e\\mu_e}\\bigg\\ } \\ , \\label{pauli}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 \\ , .",

    "the precise definition of these quantities is presented in section  [ note ] , but we should note here that we employ rationalized gaussian units , so that the energy of two electrons of charge @xmath15 a distance @xmath16 apart is given by @xmath17 .",

    "moreover , brysk  @xcite also does not obtain the second line of our result ( [ pauli ] ) .",
    "this second line does not contribute in the maxwell - boltzmann limit of very small fugactiy @xmath20 , but it does a provide a significant first - order correction in @xmath20 .    the previous work of bps  @xcite computed the exact temperature equilibration rate for a weakly to moderately coupled non - degenerate plasma .",
    "while this general result was rather complicated , the high - temperature limit , in which the short - distance coulomb scattering is given by its first born approximation , has a rather simple form .",

    "equation  ( [ lambdabps ] ) gives the precise definition of the `` coulomb log '' ( in the non - degenerate limit ) for the temperature equilibration process we have been discussing , including the correct additional constant terms , namely the terms @xmath30 .",
    "we should , however , emphasize two points .",
    "first of all , the `` coulomb log '' is by no means a universal quantity , but rather its precise form is process dependent .",
    "for example , the `` coulomb log '' for electron conductivity differs from the `` coulomb log '' for the electron - ion thermal relaxation rate given here  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we should emphasize that the `` coulomb log '' for the relaxation rate does not depend upon the ion temperature @xmath5 but only upon the electron temperature @xmath4 .",
    "some authors  @xcite incorrectly replace the squared electron debye wave number @xmath31 by the fully screened debye wave number @xmath32 .",
    "this incorrectly includes the ion contribution @xmath33 , and thus introduces a spurious dependence on the ion temperature @xmath5 .",
    "if the plasma temperature becomes very low , then the population of bound states must be taken into account .",
    "in such a regime , our assumption that the plasma is fully ionized and weakly coupled breaks down , and our calculation is no longer reliable .",
    "hence we shall discuss and examine in detail only the limit in which the degeneracy corrections are mild , the regime in which the temperature is not too low and the electron fugacity is not too large . in this limit ,",
    "only the first - order fugacity contribution from the general result ( [ pauli ] ) need be retained , and therefore the second line in eq .",
    "( [ pauli ] ) , the term omitted by brysk  @xcite , makes an essential contribution .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , however , the subleading contribution to the born approximation becomes comparable to the degeneracy correction , and it too must also be accounted for . in appendix",
    "[ sec : scatcorr ] , we therefore extract this subleading correction in the transition region between quantum and classical scattering from the general result given in bps . in the following , these two types of corrections will be called the degeneracy correction and the ( first ) quantum - to - classical transition correction .    working to leading order in the fugacity , we only need to expand eq .",

    "the condition that @xmath99 be small requires that the plasma coupling @xmath105 be even smaller than @xmath108 . to put this in perspective , we recall that even if fermi - dirac statistics are required , the debye wave - number is smaller than that given by the maxwell - boltzmann form with the same temperature and density . hence we have @xmath109 where the electron number density on the right - hand side of this equation is given by maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "using now the number density ( [ mbn ] ) in the maxwell - boltzmann limit and the definition ( [ deflambd ] ) of the thermal wavelength , we find that @xmath110 thus , even for somewhat large electron fugacities @xmath111 , the expansion parameter @xmath99 will be small provided the temperature is reasonably large .",
    "to explain further the utility of @xmath99 as the appropriate expansion parameter , we examine the situation when the spatial dimension @xmath64 departs from its physical value @xmath112 . in this case , as we shall soon see in the next subsection , the coulomb potential a distance @xmath16 away from a point charge has the dependence @xmath113 .",

    "both are accurate to  @xmath216 in the plasma coupling , and no better .",
    "the trouble with their formulation is that it also produces a subset of higher order terms , and there is no reason that these provide a more accurate evaluation .",
