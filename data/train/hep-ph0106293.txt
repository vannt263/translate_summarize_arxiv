    "the discovery of the higgs boson as the culprit for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is one of the most challenging goals of present and future high - energy experiments . within the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the mass of the physical higgs particle is basically unconstrained with an upper bound of @xmath5 gev  @xcite .",
    "however , present data from precision measurements of electroweak quantities favor a moderate mass ( 113 gev @xmath6 gev )  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the minimal supersymmetric version of the sm ( mssm ) , which is one of its most popular extensions , predicts a higgs boson with an upper mass bound of about 130 gev @xcite .",
    "thus the scenario with an intermediate - mass higgs boson ( 113 gev @xmath7 gev ) is both theoretically plausible and well supported by the data .",
    "detailed studies performed for both the tevatron and the lhc ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively ) have shown that there is no single production mechanism or decay channel which dominates the phenomenology over the intermediate - mass range for the higgs .",
    "associated production of @xmath8 or @xmath9  @xcite and @xmath10  @xcite , with the subsequent decay @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite , are presently considered the most promising reactions to discover an intermediate - mass higgs at both the tevatron and the lhc . in this case one of the top quarks or the weak boson present in the final state can decay leptonically , providing an efficient trigger .",
    "the major difficulties in extracting a reliable signal from either of these two channels are the combination of a small signal and the need for an accurate control of all the background sources . in this respect",
    ", it would be useful to have other processes that could raise the sensitivity in this range of masses .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the production of a higgs boson in association with a single top quark ( @xmath13 production ) at hadron colliders  @xcite . to include both top and anti - top production . ]",
    "this process can be viewed as a natural extension of the single - top production processes  @xcite , where a higgs boson is radiated off the top or off the @xmath2 that mediates the bottom - to - top transition . as in the usual single - top production ,",
    "the three processes of interest are characterized by the virtuality of the @xmath2 boson in the process : ( i ) @xmath0-channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t - channel ] ) , where the spacelike @xmath2 strikes a @xmath14 quark in the proton sea , promoting it to a top quark ; ( ii ) @xmath1-channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : s - channel ] ) , where the @xmath2 is timelike ; ( iii ) @xmath2-associated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : w - associated ] ) , where there is emission of a real @xmath2 boson .",
    "there are two reasons _ a priori _ that make the above processes worthy of attention .",
    "the first one is that , based on simple considerations , one would expect higgs plus single - top production to be relevant at the tevatron and at the lhc . while top quarks will be mostly produced in pairs via the strong interaction , the cross section for single top , which is a weak process , turns out to be rather large , about one third of the cross section for top pair production  @xcite .",
    "if a similar ratio between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is assumed , it is natural to ask whether @xmath13 production could be used together with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 as a means to discover an intermediate - mass higgs at the lhc . with this aim ,",
    "the @xmath0-channel process has been previously considered when the higgs decays into a pair of photons , with the result that too few events of this type would be produced even at high - luminosity runs at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "since the dominant decay mode of the higgs in this mass region is into @xmath3 pairs , this suggests searching for it using one or more @xmath14-tags , in a similar way as the @xmath10 analysis is conducted . this possibility is pursued in the present paper .",
    "w - associated ]    the second reason for considering higgs plus single - top production is that it gives a rather unique possibility for studying the relative sign between the coupling of the higgs to fermions and to vector bosons @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath10 production rates test respectively the higgs coupling to the @xmath2 and the yukawa coupling to the top , but they can not give any information on the relative sign between the two . in the @xmath13 case ,",
    "the @xmath0-channel and the @xmath2-associated ( @xmath1-channel ) cross sections depend strongly on the destructive ( constructive ) interference between the contributions from the higgs radiated off the top and off the @xmath2 boson .",
    "a measurement of the total rate for production of higgs plus single top would therefore provide additional information on the ewsb sector of the sm .    as will be shown in detail in the following , at the tevatron",
    "the cross section for producing a higgs in association with single top is of the order of @xmath17 fb and therefore out of the reach of run ii ( @xmath18 fb@xmath19 ) . on the other hand , with a cross section of the order of @xmath20 fb",
    ", several thousands of events will be produced at the lhc with @xmath21 fb@xmath19 .",
    "whether this will be enough to obtain a visible signal is the subject of the present investigation .",
    "as we will see , the number of signal events left after branching ratios , cuts , and efficiencies are taken into account is not large , and there are several backgrounds , both irreducible and reducible , to consider .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : xsecs ] we present the leading - order results for higgs plus single - top production at both the tevatron and the lhc , for the three channels mentioned above .",
    "the cross sections for the @xmath1-channel and @xmath2-associated processes , as well as for the @xmath0-channel process at the tevatron , have not been presented before ; we confirm the @xmath0-channel cross section at the lhc calculated in refs .",
    "we investigate in some detail the interference in the various channels .",
    "section  [ sec : tchannel ] contains a study of signal and background for the @xmath0-channel production at the lhc , with both three and four @xmath14-tags .",
    "results on the @xmath0-channel production at the lhc in the mssm are discussed in section  [ sec : susy ] .",
    "we present our conclusions in the last section .",
    "there are three channels for the production of higgs plus single top at hadron colliders :    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     although each background in the @xmath22-tag analysis is comparable to the signal , there are only a few signal events with 30 fb@xmath19 . therefore , there is little hope of observing a signal in this channel , unless significantly more than 30 fb@xmath19 can be delivered while maintaining the same detector performance . at high luminosity ( @xmath23 )",
    ", it is anticipated that the minimum @xmath24 for jets must be raised to 30 gev . in table  5",
    "we study the signal and backgrounds in this scenario ( the @xmath14-tagging efficiency is also lowered to 50% ) .",
    "after all cuts , the @xmath25 backgrounds are now each twice as large as the signal , because these backgrounds involve missing a jet , which is more likely with the increased jet @xmath24 threshold . the number of signal events in 300 fb@xmath19 is about 10 , with about 55 background events .",
    "significantly more integrated luminosity would be needed to see a signal in this channel .",
    "= 8.1 cm    = 8.1 cm",
    "it is interesting to ask whether there could be an enhancement in the signal when the production of non - minimal higgs bosons is considered . with this aim",
    "we have investigated the production of a light cp - even ( @xmath26 ) and a cp - odd ( @xmath27 ) higgs in the mssm .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm is the same as the 2hdm presented in appendix a except that it depends ( at tree - level ) on only two free parameters , which can be chosen to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the tree - level relations between the higgs masses are modified by radiative corrections that involve the supersymmetric particle spectrum , mainly of the top sector  @xcite . since the analytical form of the corrections is quite involved ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) we used hdecay  @xcite to evaluate the higgs - boson masses and the mixing parameter @xmath30 , given @xmath28 , @xmath31 and information on the stop - quark mixings and masses .    for large @xmath28 ,",
    "the masses of the heavy higgs particles approximately coincide , @xmath32 , while the cp - even higgs remains light .",
    "this is the so - called decoupling limit where the standard model couplings and particle content are recovered . in the case of large @xmath29 and small",
    "@xmath28 one finds that @xmath33 and the higgs couplings to the vector bosons and to the fermions are different from those predicted by the standard model .",
    "in particular , there is a strong enhancement of the bottom - quark coupling to both the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 , which can give rise to interesting signatures at the colliders  @xcite .",
    "we focus our attention in this area of the parameter space , which is not excluded by the measurements from lep  @xcite , choosing @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecssusy ] we show the cross section for production of the cp - even higgs @xmath26 and cp - odd higgs @xmath27 in association with single top as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these are calculated using tree - level matrix elements generated by madgraph  @xcite ( and checked against those obtained by comphep  @xcite ) convoluted with the parton distribution function set cteq5l  @xcite , and with the renormalization and factorization scales set equal to the higgs mass .",
    "we assume a simplified scenario where the third generation diagonal soft - supersymmetry - breaking squark masses are degenerate , with common value @xmath36 tev , and the mixing between the top - squarks is maximal , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 gev ( for an extensive discussion on the other possible choices see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecssusy ] , for @xmath39 the cross sections are indeed enhanced with respect to that for a standard - model higgs .",
    "however , the increase is never very large .",
    "this is basically due to two reasons .",
    "first , from the arguments presented in section 2 and appendix a , unitarity imposes large cancellations among the various diagrams , even in the mssm higgs sector . in this respect",
    ", the production of the cp - odd state @xmath27 is particularly instructive . due to its cp quantum numbers",
    ", this state can not couple to two @xmath2 s and therefore the contribution from the second diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - channel ] vanishes .",
    "one might guess that the destructive interference with the diagrams where @xmath27 couples to the quarks can not take place anymore and the signal could be much larger .",
    "in fact , the complete calculation shows that the diagram where the @xmath27 couples to the @xmath2 and a charged higgs @xmath40 ( see the second diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : t - chan-2hdm ] ) provides the terms which cancel the large ( and unitarity - violating ) contributions coming from the other diagrams ( appendix a ) .",
    "second , the effects due to the choice of a large value of @xmath29 work in opposite directions for the bottom and the top quark , leading to an enhancement of the coupling of the higgs to bottom but to a suppression for the top quark . as a result",
    "the rates for the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 are comparable to that of a standard - model higgs with a similar mass for @xmath41 . for instance , taking @xmath42 gev and @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 fb , which is 2.5 times the cross section expected in the standard model . considering the production of the two higgs bosons together , it would be possible to achieve a significance @xmath45 in the @xmath22-tag analyses ( see tables  4 and 5 ) .",
    "in this paper we revisited the production of the higgs boson in association with single top at hadron colliders .",
    "we provided the full set of cross sections at both the tevatron and the lhc for the three production processes ( @xmath0-channel , @xmath1-channel and @xmath2-associated ) and we investigated in some detail why they are smaller than what one would expect comparing with @xmath46 production .",
    "for the @xmath0-channel , which gives the most important contribution at the lhc , this is due to large cancellations taking place between different diagrams .",
    "we have shown that the above peculiarity is not accidental but is a consequence of the renormalizability of theory , and we gave a detailed proof in the general framework of a two - higgs - doublet model .",
    "focusing on the @xmath0-channel process , we discussed the possibility of detecting the production of higgs plus single top at the lhc , concentrating on the decay of the higgs into @xmath47 .",
    "we considered events where three and four @xmath14 quarks are tagged . in the case of three @xmath14-tags",
    ", there is an overwhelming background from @xmath48 . in the case of four @xmath14-tags",
    "there is no single overwhelming background , but rather several backgrounds that are comparable to the signal .",
    "given our present expectations for detector capabilities and luminosity at the lhc , it seems unlikely that one can extract a signal from the backgrounds .",
    "there are several things that could improve this prognosis .",
    "several of the backgrounds involve a mistagged @xmath49 quark , and if the mistag rate can be reduced significantly below 10% , these backgrounds would be less severe",
    ". one might also be able to find a more efficient set of cuts to reduce the backgrounds .",
    "since the signal involves the @xmath0-channel exchange of a @xmath2 boson , one might be able to use a rapidity gap to distinguish the signal from the reducible backgrounds ( the irreducible backgrounds also involve @xmath0-channel @xmath2 exchange , however )  @xcite .",
    "finally we have also presented the results for the @xmath0-channel production of the cp - even state @xmath26 and the cp - odd state @xmath27 of the mssm at the lhc . for @xmath34 gev and large @xmath29",
    "there is a moderate enhancement of the production rate compared to that of a standard - model higgs which may be enough to disentangle the signal from the qcd backgrounds .",

    "in this appendix we consider the case of @xmath0-channel production in a generic two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "using the effective-@xmath2 approximation , we show that the amplitudes represented by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - chan-2hdm ] contain terms that grow with energy .",
    "nevertheless , the unitarity of the model implies that these terms must cancel in the final result , as we show explicitly . in a generic 2hdm that is invariant under @xmath50 and",
    "conserves cp , the scalar fields @xmath51 are doublets of @xmath52 with hypercharge @xmath53 and they develop vacuum expectation values @xmath54 that break @xmath50 to @xmath55 .",

    "the particle content can be exploited to fully parameterize the model .",
    "in addition to @xmath59 , we can use the masses of the four scalars @xmath60 , the mixing angle @xmath30 between the cp - even states @xmath61 , and one of couplings appearing in the quartic potential .",
    "the inclusion of the fermions must be done with care in order to suppress tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents .",
    "one common choice is to impose a discrete symmetry in such a way that @xmath62 couples only to down - type quarks and leptons while @xmath63 couples only to up - type quarks  @xcite .",
