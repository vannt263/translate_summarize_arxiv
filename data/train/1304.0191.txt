    "our study is based on sdss spectra . to study the redshift evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances , accurate oxygen and nitrogen abundance determinations are of course a prerequisite .",
    "abundances in hii regions determined from sdss spectra suffer from the following problem , however .",
    "line fluxes in sdss spectra are measured by an automatic procedure , which inevitably introduces large flux errors for some objects .",
    "we therefore wish to exclude them from further consideration .",
    "a method to recognise such objects relies on the fact that there exist a fundamental hii region sequence .",
    "the emission line properties of photoionised hii regions are governed by their heavy element content and by the electron temperature distribution within each photoionised nebula .",
    "the latter is controlled by the ionising star cluster s spectral energy distribution and by the chemical composition of the hii region .",
    "the evolution of a giant extragalactic hii region associated with a star cluster is thus caused by a gradual change over time ( due to stellar evolution ) of the integrated stellar energy distribution .",

    "the general conclusion from those studies is that hii regions ionised by star clusters form a well - defined fundamental sequence in different emission - line diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the existence of such a fundamental sequence forms the basis for studying various properties of extragalactic hii regions .",
    "first , @xcite have suggested the position of an object in some well - chosen emission - line diagrams can be used to separate hii regions ionised by star clusters from other types of emission - line objects .",
    "second , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the positions of hii regions in some emission - line diagrams can be calibrated in terms of their oxygen abundances .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we adopt here a simple method to recognise star - forming galaxies with accurate line fluxes measurements .",
    "it is based on the idea that if _ i ) _ an object belongs to the fundamental hii region sequence , and _",
    "ii ) _ its line fluxes are measured accurately , then the different relations between the line fluxes and the physical characteristic of hii regions , based on different emission lines , should yield similar physical characteristics ( such as electron temperatures and abundances ) of that object .    fig .",
    "[ figure : e - e ] show comparisons of differences between values of oxygen ( nitrogen ) abundances determined in various ways for the @xmath39 sample of reference hii regions . fig .",
    "[ figure : e - e ] also shows that the correlation between differences in oxygen abundances determined in different ways is weak .",
    "a correlation between differences in nitrogen abundances determined in different ways is more evident .",
    "although these correlations are not very tight one can expect that the conditions @xmath42log(o / h)@xmath40  log(o / h)@xmath41@xmath42 @xmath43 0.05 and @xmath42log(n / h)@xmath40  log(n / h)@xmath41@xmath42 @xmath43 0.10 allow to select the sdss objects with more or less reliable abundances .",
    "thus , to select star - forming galaxies with accurate line fluxes measurements , we require that , for each galaxy , the oxygen ( o / h)@xmath40 and ( o / h)@xmath41 and nitrogen ( n / h)@xmath40 and ( n / h)@xmath41 abundances agree .    it should be noted that the @xmath26 method was developed for hii regions in the low - density regime .",

    "another subset of galaxies were excluded from consideration using the following conditions . in some cases ,",
    "hii regions in giant spiral galaxies seem to be catalogued as dwarf galaxies of small dimensions .",
    "thus , if a `` galaxy '' has a petrosian radius less than 3 kpc , this galaxy is then excluded from our list .",
    "further , the aperture correction factor ( see below ) for some galaxies is @xmath51 , i.e. , the galaxy light within the fiber exceeds the total light of the galaxy . the galaxy light fraction within",
