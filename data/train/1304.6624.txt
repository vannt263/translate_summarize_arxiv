    "since the 19th century potential theory has been growing continuously as gravitational and electromagnetic interactions and forces were derived from potentials satisfying laplace , poisson and helmholtz equations .",
    "some boundary value problems such as the dirichlet problem and the neumann problem , the electrostatic distribution of charges on conductors or the robin problem can all be defined in terms of potential theory . for domains with sufficiently smooth boundaries",
    "the above problems use specific types of potentials like the volume potential , the single- and the double - layer potentials , the logarithmic potential for two - dimensional domains , etc . @xcite .",
    "the dirichlet and neumann problems defined on domains with sufficiently smooth boundaries ( i.e. , a regular piecewise lyapunov surface @xcite ) can be recast in integral equations which lead to compact operators on domain boundary : the neumann - poincar operator and its adjoint @xcite .",
    "these methods are successfully applied in some practical and physical problems regarding dielectric heterogeneous systems @xcite like radio - frequency and microwave dielectric spectra of living cells @xcite and plasmonic properties of metallic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "another problem which stems from potential theory is the equilibrium charge distribution on a conductor ( the robin problem ) @xcite and the implicit capacitance with applications in computational biophysics @xcite , in scanning probe microscopy @xcite , or in electrical charge storage in supercapacitors @xcite .",
    "the capacitance of an arbitrarily shaped body is directly related to hydrodynamic friction and to diffusion - controlled reaction rate @xcite .",
    "thus a method of calculating the capacitance is based on `` mimicking '' the diffusion - controlled reaction rate on an object of arbitrary shape as random walks @xcite .",
    "another random walk method is defined just on the boundary and is given by the ergodic generation of the equilibrium charge distribution @xcite .",
    "a standard procedure for solving the laplace equation is the finite element method ( fem ) @xcite and the boundary integral equation ( bie ) method which leads to a finite element formulation as the boundary element method ( bem ) @xcite . in the fem",
    "the entire domain is discretized by using elements and the associated basis functions , while in the bem only the surfaces of the inclusions within the domain are used for discretization .",
    "the bounded and the unbounded domains are on equal footing in the bem . on the other hand , the fem solves the static and quasi - static electromagnetic field problems in unbounded domains by using one of the additional ingredients : infinite elements @xcite , coordinate transformations @xcite , or hybrid fem / bem methods @xcite .",
    "infinite domains can be elegantly and efficiently treated with the hybrid trefftz method , where , beside the usual elements , an additional set of functions is employed to treat singularities and infinities @xcite .    in this paper , by a bie method @xcite , we will define the capacitance and the equilibrium charge of an arbitrarily shaped object in terms of the eigenvectors of the neumann - poincar operator and of its adjoint @xcite .",
    "compared to other methods the operator based bie method provides directly the geometric dependence of capacitance that is incorporated in an eigenvector norm of the neumann - poincar operator .",
    "this eigenvector corresponds to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "accordingly , capacitance is obtained concurrently with other physical properties like localized plasmon resonances of metallic nanoparticles that have the same shape @xcite .",
    "furthermore , operator perturbations on eigenvalues and on eigenvectors permit the perturbative estimation of capacitance and other physical properties .",
    "the reformulation of capacitance allows defining several scale - invariant shape factors that can also be readily used in the estimation of capacitance for arbitrary shapes .",

    "we have shown also how the capacitance of a capacitor can be related to the individual capacitance of each surface of the capacitor .",
    "thus , when the outer surface of the capacitor is an equipotential surface generated by the charging of the inner surface then the capacitor behaves like a series capacitor with the total capacitance as being the capacitance of the inner surface in series with the opposite ( negative ) capacitance of the outer surface of the capacitor .",
    "these results have been used in the analysis of membrane capacitance in living cells , where the parallel - plane capacitor model works for spherical cells but is not appropriate for membrane capacitance of arbitrarily shaped living cells .",
    "the capacitance formula allows us to define scale - invariant shape factors that can be used in the approximate calculation of capacitance .",
    "we have analyzed two scale - invariant shape factors .",
    "one of the shape factors employs the volume of the object and is more suitable for long shapes like rods or wires .",
    "alternatively , the other shape factor , which is defined in terms of the object area , is appropriate for objects with shapes close to a sphere .",
