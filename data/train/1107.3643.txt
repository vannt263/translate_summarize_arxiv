    "exoplanet research has grown explosively in the past decade , supported by improvements in observational techniques that have led to increasingly sensitive detection and characterization . among many results",
    ", we have learned that planets are common , but their physical and orbital properties are much more diverse than originally thought .",
    "a lasting challenge is the detection and characterization of planetary systems consisting in a mixed cortege of telluric and giant planets , with a special regard to telluric planets orbiting in the habitable zone ( hz ) of sun - like stars .",
    "the accomplishment of this goal requires the development of a new generation of facilities , due to the intrinsic difficulty of detecting earth - like planets with existing instruments .",
    "the proposed neat mission has been designed to enter a new phase in exoplanetary science by delivering an enhanced capability of detecting small planets at and beyond 1au .",
    "astrometry is probably the oldest branch of astronomy .",
    "greeks developed it and noticed that the position of most stars were stable in the sky , but the few that were moving became known as _ planets _ ( planetes > asteres = moving stars ) , pointing to a major difference in their nature . thanks to the precise astrometric measurements of planet positions by tycho brahe in the 16th century , johannes kepler established that these objects were orbiting the sun on elliptical orbits , expanding the copernican revolution .",
    "after hipparcos , gaia will play an important role in finding many systems with giant planets in our galaxy .",
    "we want to extend these revolutions with the neat mission , namely to discover and characterize earth - mass planets in earth - like orbits around stars like the sun , by capturing infinitesimal displacements with unprecedented accuracy .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : neat - science ] , we present the science objectives of neat , we describe the principle of the differential astrometry technique and we give a list of potential targets . in sect .",
    "[ sec : neat - concept ] , after listing the technical challenges , we present the instrumental concept . we explain how to reach the performance and we give a summarized description of the payload , the mission and the spacecraft . in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss both astrophysical and technical issues",
    ". recommandations by the community summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : perspectives ] is an incentive to pursue the development of this mission in the future .",
    "the prime goal of neat is to detect and characterize planetary systems orbiting bright stars in the solar neighborhood that have a planetary architecture like that of our solar system or an alternative planetary system made of earth mass planets .",
    "it will allow the detection around nearby stars of planets equivalent to venus , earth , ( mars ) , jupiter , and saturn , with orbits possibly similar to those in our solar system .",
    "it will permit to detect and characterize the orbits and the masses of many alternate configurations , e.g.  where the asteroid belt is occupied by another earth mass planet and no jupiter .",
    "the neat mission will answer the following questions :    * what are the dynamical interactions between giant and telluric planets in a large variety of systems ? * what are the detailed processes involved in planet formation as revealed by their present configuration ? * what are the distributions of architectures of planetary systems in our neighborhood up to @xmath3pc ? * what are the masses , and orbital parameters , of telluric planets that are candidates for future direct detection and spectroscopic characterization missions ?",
    "special emphasis will be put on planets in the _ habitable zone _ because this is a region of prime interest for astrobiology .",
    "indeed orbital parameters obtained with neat will allow spectroscopic follow - up observations to be scheduled precisely when the configuration is the most favorable .",
    "the principle of neat is to measure accurately the offset angles between a target and 6 - 8 distant reference stars with the aim of differentially detecting the reflex motion of the target star due to the presence of its planets .",

    "[ tab : target - list ]    a possible target list is shown in table  [ tab : target - list ] where we consider the list of the nearest f , g , k stars deduced from the hipparcos 2007 catalogue , disregarding spectroscopic binaries , and stars with an activity level 5 times greater than that of the sun because of their astrometric noise and for which we compute the astrometric signal for a planet with given mass in the hz of the stars @xcite .",
    "conservatively , we select the inner part of the hz in order to be able to detect the planet whatever is its location in the hz .",

    "our goal is to detect the signal corresponding to the reflex motion of a sun - like star at 10pc due to an earth - mass planet in its hz , with an equivalent final snr of 6 . that astrometric signal is 0.30@xmath35 .",
    "the required noise floor is 0.05@xmath35 , over 100 times lower than gaia s best precision ( 7@xmath35 ) .",
    "achieving sub - micro - arcsecond astrometric precision , e.g. 0.8@xmath35 , in 1 hour and a noise floor under 0.05@xmath35with a telescope of diameter d requires mastering all effects that could impact the determination of the position of the point spread function .",
    "the typical diffraction limited size of an unresolved star is about @xmath36 , which corresponds to 0.16 arcseconds for a 1-m telescope operating in the visible spectral region .",
    "the challenge is therefore to control these systematics effects to a level better than 1 part in 3 million ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "even though differential astrometry of stars within the same field of view softens somewhat the requirement , this level of accuracy can only be obtained in an atmosphere - free space environment .",
    "sub - micro - arcsecond level astrometry requires solutions to four challenges :    * * photon noise .",
    "* most targets are @xmath38mag stars , but the required reference stars are @xmath39mag so they dominate the photon noise . using the mean stellar density in the sky , one finds that a field of view ( fov ) as large as diam @xmath40 is needed to get several ( 6 to 8) of theses references ( see e.g. fig  [ fig : ups - and ] ) . *",
    "* beam walk .",
    "* a classical three mirror anastigmat ( tma ) telescope can also manage a @xmath40 diffraction limited fov .",
    "however the light coming from different stars , and therefore from different directions , will hit the secondary and tertiary mirrors on different physical parts of the mirrors .",
    "the mirror defects will therefore produce different and prohibitive astrometric errors between the images of the stars .",
    "using a single mirror telescope solves this problem .",
    "to obtain sufficiently high angular resolution , a long focal length ( @xmath41 m ) for this mirror is needed , with no intermediate mirrors , a relatively unusual solution in modern optical astronomy . *",
    "* stability of the focal plane . * proper nyquist sampling with typical detector pixels of the order of 10@xmath42requires a focal plane at a focal length of 40 m .",
    "such a focal plane covering a fov of @xmath40 diameter would yield a costly detector mosaic with @xmath43 pixels .",
    "sub - microarcesc astrometry over a @xmath40-diameter fov requires the geometry of the focal plane to be stable to @xmath44 .",
    "therefore thermal stability of the focal plane geometry will be a major challenge although it has to be investigated in details .",
    "instead of building a gigapixel focal plane with unprecedented stability we plan to use 9 small @xmath45 ccds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : focal - plane - concept ] ) and a laser metrology system to measure the position of every pixel to the required precision , once every 10 to 30s .",
    "we do not rely on their positioning , but measure it accurately with a laser metrology based on dynamic interference fringes . * * quantum efficiency ( qe ) variations . *",
    "the dynamic fringes also allow the measurement of the inter- and intra - pixel qe variations .",
    "we characterize each pixel response with six parameters such that the systematic errors are kept below @xmath46 .",
    "this is a process derived from the sim studies .",
    "these effects have in the past hampered the performance of space missions like hst .",
    "the proposed mission is based on a concept recently proposed by m.  shao and his colleagues that results from the experience gained in working with many astrometry concepts ( sim , sim - lite , corono - astrometry ) .",
    "the concept is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : payload - concept ] and consists of a primary mirror an off - axis parabolic 1-m mirror a focal plane 40 m away , and metrology calibration sources .",
    "the large distance between the primary optical surface and the focal plane can be implemented as two spacecraft flying in formation , or a long deployed boom .",
    "the focal plane with the detectors having a field of view of @xmath40 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : focal - plane - concept ] .",
    "it has a geometrical extent of @xmath47 .",
    "the focal plane is composed of eight @xmath45 visible ccds located each one on an xy translation stage while the central two ccds are fixed in position .",
    "the ccd pixels are 10@xmath42 in size .",
    "sub - fields .",
    "exterior subfields have visible arrays which can be moved in x and y directions to image the reference stars .",
    "the central field has two fixed arrays , one for the target star and one for the telescope axis tracker . ]",
    "the principle of the measurement is to point the spacecraft so that the target star , which is usually brighter ( @xmath38 ) than the reference stars ( @xmath39 ) , is located on the axis of the telescope and at the center of the central ccd .",
    "then the 8 other ccds are moved to center each of the reference stars on one of them .",
    "to measure the distance between the stars , we use a metrology calibration system that is launched from the telescope spacecraft and that feeds several optical fibers ( 4 or more ) located at the edge of the mirror .",
    "the fibers illuminate the focal plane and form young s fringes detected simultaneously by each ccd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : metrology - concept ] ) .",
    "the fringes have their optical wavelengths modulated by acoustic optical modulators ( aoms ) that are accurately shifted by 10hz , from one fiber to the other so that fringes move over the ccds .",
    "these fringes allow us to solve for the xyz position of each ccd .",
    "an additional benefit from the dynamic fringes on the ccds is to measure the qe of the pixels ( inter- , and intra - pixel dependence ) .",
    "the ccds are read at 50hz providing many frames that will yield high accuracy .    with the proposed concept ,",
    "it is possible to achieve all of the main technical requirements :    * * focal plane stability . * instead of maintaining a focal plane geometry stable at the 0.1 nm level for a 5-yr duration , which is impossible , we implement a metrology for every pixel at the sub - nanometer level , with an interferometric system that has been qualified by the sim - lite laboratory demonstrators .",
    "* * reference frame .",
    "* by measuring the fringes at the sub - nanometer level using the information from all the pixels of each ccd ( sim - lite technology ) , it is possible to solve for the position of all reference stars compared to the central target with an accuracy of 0.8@xmath35per hour .",
    "the field of view of @xmath48 allows us to have 6 to 8 reference stars brighter than @xmath49 in most fields . *",
    "* photon noise . *",
    "the field of @xmath48 provides about 6 to 8 stars of magnitude brighter than @xmath50 .",
    "the number of photons received by one 11-mag star on the system is @xmath51 . since the fwhm of diffraction - limited stars is @xmath52 arcsecond , the photon noise limit in 1h of integration due to a set of 6 reference stars is @xmath53 . with more than @xmath54 measurements of a few hours",
    "spread over 5yrs , the equivalent precision is 0.05@xmath35 in ra and dec , corresponding to the detection of the 0.30@xmath35signal with a snr @xmath55 . *",
    "* large - scale calibration .",
    "* the detector plane does not have to be fully covered by pixels , since the positions of the reference stars are known from available catalogues ( 10 - 20mas for tycho 2 , and about tens of @xmath35for gaia ) .",
    "for the target stars ( @xmath38 ) , we use the hipparcos catalog ( few mas accuracy ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath56 of the psf or the fringe width .",
    "the number of fringes between the target star and the reference stars is then known , only the positions of the star centroids relative to the interferometric fringe have to be measured accurately .",
    "the use of 10 small ccds drastically reduces the cost of what would otherwise be a giga - pixel focal plane and also helps to control systematics .",
    "with such a concept , the mission performance would be similar to , and even more favorable for exoplanets , than what was proposed for sim - lite with 5 years of operation , but at the price of giving up all - sky astrometry and the corresponding science objectives .",
    "achieving a relative precision of @xmath57 is slightly better than the precision achievable by only the combination of our metrology laser , the thermal expansion coefficient of the primary mirror and our expected temperature stability .",
    "achieving our target precision relies on not only the metrology stability , but also on the precise knowledge of the positions of the multiple reference stars used since the expected motions of the references can not be considered as fixed ( see discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : astro - challenges ] ) .",
    "our comprehensive error budget takes into account all sources of error , including instrumental effects , photon noise and astrophysical errors in the reference star positions .",
    "the biggest term is the brightness dependent error for the set of reference stars .",
    "the half - width of the psf for the coma - aberrated images of the reference stars is about 19@xmath42on the focal plane ( or 100mas on the sky ) .",
    "after 1s of integration , @xmath58 photoelectrons are detected for each of the 11-mag reference star ; their centroid location can be estimated to @xmath59 rms ( @xmath60 pixel or 0.08mas ) . since all the stars are measured simultaneously",
    ", the stars do not need to be kept centered on the detector at the sub - mas level , but only to a fraction of the psf width to avoid spreading of the photon outside of the psf and therefore cause the psf effective width to be larger .",
    "a tenth of pixel ( 1@xmath42 ) stability over the one - second integration is sufficient .",
    "after 3400s of integration , the statistical averaged position of the barycenter of the set of reference stars ( @xmath39mag ) will be measured with a residual 0.126 nm ( 0.63@xmath35 ) uncertainty .",
    "similarly , the position of the target star ( @xmath61mag ) will be measured with a residual 0.024 nm ( 0.12@xmath35 ) uncertainty .",
    "although the spacecraft will have moved by several arc - seconds , the differential position between the target star and the barycenter of the set of reference stars will be determined to 0.64@xmath35 .",
    "similarly , the focal plane metrology system will have determined the differential motion of the target ccd relative to the barycenter of the set of reference ccds with an error smaller than 0.16@xmath35after @xmath62s metrology measurements .",
    "neat will not be capable of measuring the absolute separation between the target and the set of reference stars to 0.8@xmath35 .",
    "neat objectives will therefore be to measure the change in the _ relative _ position of those stars between successive observations spread over the mission life , with an error of 0.8@xmath35for each one hour visit .",
    "the six major errors terms are captured in the simplified version of the error budget shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : error - budget ] .",
    "if unmonitored , the displacement of the projected field aberrations on the focal plane would produce a 60@xmath35differential astrometric error per arcsecond of relative spacecraft motion .",
    "the telescope axis tracker will monitor the relative position of the focal plane relative to the parabola axis simultaneously with the stellar observation with a 1mas accuracy per hour .",
    "this will be sufficient to correct the observations during post - processing for the field - dependent aberration to better than 0.1@xmath35 .",
    "static figure errors of the primary mirror will produce centroid offsets that are mostly common - mode across the entire field of view .",
    "differential centroid offsets are significantly smaller than the field - dependent coma and are in fact negligible .",
    "similarly , changes in the primary mirror surface error , e.g.  due to thermal dilatation , meteorite impacts , ... produce mostly common - mode centroid shifts and negligible differential centroid offsets . on the other hand , displacement and changes in the shape of the psf would couple with the ccd response if the ccd response is not properly calibrated . this is continuously done by the metrology fringes .",
    "* focal plane assembly*. a proposition for implementation of the focal plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : focal - plane - drawing ] .",
    "the detector is foreseen to be a ccd fabricated by the e2v technologies company in uk .",
    "the target star , the reference star and the telescope axis tracker will all use the same ccd that includes the capability to read windowed images , typically @xmath63 to @xmath64 pixels .",
    "the 8 xy tables consist of two linear tables mounted on top of each other .",
    "each table uses a piezo - reptation motor , a linear ball bearing system and an optical incremental encoder .",
    "these motors fulfill several requirements of simplicity : they are self - locked when they are not powered ; they can be used both for large displacements by stepping up to @xmath65 and elementary analog motion down to 50 nm . since",
    "8 tables are used in parallel in the focal plane , the loss of one table is not a single point failure . an alternative implementation could be to drive the xy tables with ball screws and rotary motors .",
    "the limited resolution of such a motor stage ( about 5@xmath42 ) could be supplemented by a second high - resolution piezo xy table , mounted on top of the first xy table .",
    "the main structure of the focal xy tables consists of a large lightweight aluminum cylinder which is thermally controlled and in which pockets are machined for the fixation of the xy tables .",
    "* telescope*. the primary mirror is an off - axis paraboloid , with a 1 m diameter clear aperture , an off - axis distance of 1 m and a focal length of 40 m .",

    "the telescope axis tracker is used to estimate the location of the primary mirror axis with respect to the focal plane in order to monitor it and then correct for the telescope field dependent errors .",
    "the sensor is the second fixed ccd located in the focal - plane .",
    "the launcher would consist of either an achromatic doublet or an aspherical singlet lens , embedded in the primary mirror substrate at its center and a single - mode fiber - coupled laser diode .",
    "[ fig : telescope - axis - tracker ] shows how the fiber tip is re - imaged onto telescope axis tracker ccd in the focal plane .    * laser metrology*. the focal - plane metrology system consists of the metrology source similar to the one developed for sim @xcite , the metrology fiber launchers and the focal plane detectors ( ccds ) which alternatively measure the stellar signal ( 57s observations ) and the metrology ( 1s per axis every minutes ) .",
    "the metrology fiber launchers consist of nominally four optical fibers attached to the primary mirror substrate .",
    "three of them are located around the edge of the mirror , and are used by pairs in order to conduct three redundant measurements of the relative location of the ccds .",
    "the fourth fiber is located inside the clear aperture , and is used in combination with each of the three other fibers to produce three additional measurements during focal plane calibration and calibrate the distance mirror - focal plane .    *",
    "pointing servo systems*. the pointing of the telescope from one target to the next one is accomplished by the two spacecraft in formation flying .",
    "the target stars will be typically separated by @xmath67 .",
    "re - pointing of the telescope will require rotation of the two spacecraft by several degrees using reaction wheels and translation of the telescope spacecraft by several meters using hydrazine propulsion .",

    "the separation does not require a servo - loop of the payload , because its effect is only a degradation in performance ( when fwhm increases , final precision decreases in same proportion ) and is managed in the error budget .    during the observation ,",
    "the instrument uses a tip - tilt stage behind the primary mirror to center the target star on the @xmath69 pixel sub - window on the target star ccd .",
    "once in the @xmath69 pixel sub - frame mode , the target star ccd is read at 500hz , and feedback control between the ccd and the tip - tilt stage can be used to keep the star centered on the detector to better than 5 milli - arc - second rms ( 0.1 pixel rms ) for the duration of the observation .",
    "this is the only active feedback loop in the instrument system working at 50hz ; the other degrees of freedom ( focal plane tip , tilt , clocking and focal - plane - to - mirror separation ) are monitored but not corrected for in real - time .",

    "formation flying and 40 m focal length . *",
    "the mission relies on a 40 m focal length telescope , for which the preferred solution is to use two satellites in formation flying .",
    "the performance to be provided by the two satellites in order to initialize the payload metrology systems are of the order of magnitude of @xmath70 mm in relative motion , and of 3 arcseconds in relative pointing , which are typically compatible with formation flying units and gyroless aocs architecture .",
    "in addition , at l2 , the solar pressure is the main disturbance for formation flying control . as a result ,",
    "surface - to - mass ratio ( s / m ratio ) is the main satellite drift contributor and should be as close as possible for the two satellites .",
    "although satellite design can cope with these requirements , the s / m ratio of the satellites will evolve during the mission ( because of fuel losses and sun angle ) .",
    "however , the preliminary mission assessment tends to demonstrate that the s / m difference between the two satellites can be reduced down to 20 - 30% , which is deemed compatible with mission formation flying requirements .    *",

    "the mission aims at a complete survey of a large number of targets and the maximization of the number of acquisitions will be a main objective of the next mission phases .",
    "the mission objectives require a threshold of 20,000 acquisitions ( see sect .",

    "in addition , the time allocation for these reconfiguration maneuvers is quite limited , in order to free more than 85% of mission duration for observations . as a result",
    ", the mission is characterized by a large @xmath71 ( 550 to 880 m/s ) dedicated to reconfigurations , plus allocations for fine relative motion initialization and control using the @xmath72-propulsion system .",

    "a first simple and robust mission concept has been identified .          the preliminary neat mission assessment allowed to identify a safe and robust mission architecture ( fig .",

    "in addition , the spacecraft will typically perform 12 to 20 daily reconfigurations of less than @xmath67 of the system line of sight corresponding to 7 m of translation of one satellite compared to the other perpendicular to the line of sight . during these configurations",
    ", the telescope satellite will perform translations supported by the ff - rf units using its large hydrazine tanks ( 250 kg ) for a @xmath73 m/s .",
    "when the two satellites will approach the required configuration , the telescope satellite will freeze , and the focal plane satellite will perform fine relative pointing control using micro - propulsion system . as a result , the micro - propulsion will have to compensate for hydrazine control inaccuracies , which will require large nitrogen gas tanks ( 92 kg for @xmath74 m/s ) .",
    "finally , 28 kg of hydrazine carried by the fp satellite allows @xmath75 m/s for station keeping and other operations .    * satellite design description . *",
    "the design of the two satellites is based on a 1194 mm central tube architecture , which will allow a low structural index for the stacked configuration and provides accommodation for payloads and large hydrazine tanks .",
    "strong heritage does exist on the two satellites avionics and aocs .",
    "in addition , they both require similar function which would allow to introduce synergies between the two satellites for design , procurement , assembly , integration and tests .",
    "the proposed aocs configuration is a gyroless architecture relying on reaction wheels and high - performance star trackers ( hydra sodern ) , which is compatible with a 3arcsec pointing accuracy ( see end of sect .",
    "[ sec : design - payload - subsystems ] for payload control ) . the satellites communication subsystems use x - band active pointing antenna , supported by large gain antenna for low earth orbit positioning and cruise , coupled with a 50w rf transmitter .",
    "the active pointing medium gain antenna allows simultaneous data acquisition and downlink . a reference solution for the satellite on - board computer could rely on the herschel - planck avionics .",
    "the two satellites would have custom mechanical - thermal - propulsion architectures .",
    "the telescope satellite features a dry mass of 724 kg and the focal plane satellite a dry mass of 656 kg .",
    "the focal plane satellite carries the stacked configuration .",
    "the payload ( focal plane + baffle ) are assembled inside a 1194 mm central tube , which will also ensure the stacked configuration structural stiffness .",
    "the spacecraft bus , and large cold gas tanks , will be assembled on a structural box carried by the central tube .",
    "the proposed architecture uses a large hydrazine tank inside the 1194 mm central tube which offers a capacity of up to 600 kg hydrazine , thus allowing both a low filling ratio and a large mission growth potential .",
    "the payload module with the payload mirror , rotating mechanisms and baffle is then assembled on the central tube .",
    "* proposed procurement approach . *",
    "the neat mission is particularly adapted to offer a modular spacecraft approach , with simple interfaces between payload and spacecraft bus elements . for both satellites ,",
    "the payload module is clearly identified and assembled inside the structural 1194 mm central tube .",
    "in addition , a large number of satellite building blocks can be common to the two satellites , in order to ease mission procurement and tests .",
    "this configuration is particularly compatible with the esa procurement scheme .",
    "the payload is made of 3 subsystems : primary mirror and its dynamic support , the focal plane with its detectors and the metrology .",
    "* alternative mission concept*.        an alternative mission concept would consist of a single spacecraft with an adam - like deployable boom ( from atk - able engineering ) that connects the telescope and the focal plane modules .",
    "the preliminary investigation made by cnes identified no show - stoppers for this option : no prohibitive oscillation modes during observation ; during maneuvers , the boom oscillation modes can be excited but they can be filtered by kalman filters ( srtm demonstration ) .",
    "the use of dampers on the boom structure allows damping at a level of 10% of the oscillations .",
    "the main worry concerns retargeting , which requires large reaction wheels or control momentum gyroscopes ( cmgs ) on the spacecraft due to the important inertia but propellers could be added at the boom end . a possible implementation made by jpl",

    "[ fig : alt - concept ] .",
    "* stellar activity . *",
    "if all instrumental problems are controlled then the next obstacle to achieve the scientific objective is of astrophysical nature , the impact of stellar activity .",
    "spots and bright structures on the stellar surface induce astrometric , photometric and rv signals . using the sun as a proxy ,",
    "have computed the astrometric , photometric and rv variations that would be measured from an observer located 10 pc away .",
    "it appears that the astrometric variations due to spots and bright structures are small compared to the signal of an earth mass planet in the hz .",
    "this remains true throughout the entire solar cycle .",
    "if we consider a star _ 5 times more active than the active sun _ , an earth - mass planet would still be detectable even during the highest activity phases .",
    "such activity , or lower , translates in terms of activity index @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , in our target list , we have kept only stars with such an index ( _ only 4% were discarded _ ) , for which their intrinsic activity should not prevent the detection of an earth - mass planet , even during its high activity period .",
    "* perturbations from reference stars .",
    "* the vast majority of the reference stars will be k giants at a distance of @xmath77kpc .",
    "the important parameters in addition to the position are the proper motion with typical value of @xmath78mas / yr and the parallax whose typical value is @xmath78mas .",
    "they are to be compared to the accuracy of the cumulative measurements during a visit .",
    "an important value for neat accuracy is what is obtained for an @xmath79 magnitude target : 0.8@xmath35/h .",
    "the ratios between that ( required ) accuracy and the expected motions of the references indicates clearly that the latter can not be considered as fixed .",
    "their positions are members of the set of parameters that have to be solved for .",
    "because the reference stars are much more distant ( @xmath80kpc ) than the target star ( @xmath81pc ) , we are 100 times less sensitive to their planetary perturbations .",
    "only saturn - jupiter mass objects matter , and statistically , they are only present around @xmath81% of stars .",
    "these massive planets can be searched for by fitting first the reference star system ( @xmath82 measurements for @xmath83 parameters when there are no giant planets around the reference stars ) , possibly eliminate those with giant planets , and studying the target star with respect to that new reference frame . moreover , the largest disturbers will be detected from ground based radial velocity measurements , and the early release of gaia data around 2016 will greatly improve the position accuracy of the reference stars . for smaller planets at or below the threshold of detection , their impact on the target astrometry will be only at a level @xmath84 around it .",
    "similarly the activity of these k giants has been investigated and neither the stellar pulsations nor the stellar spots will disturb the signal at the expected accuracy .    * planetary system extraction from astrometric data . *",
    "we recently carried out a major numerical simulation to test how well a space astrometry mission could detect planets in multi - planet systems @xcite .",
    "the simulation engaged 5 teams of theorists who generated model systems , and 5 teams of double - blind _",
    "`` observers '' _ who analyzed the simulated data with noise included .",
    "the parameters of the study were the same as for neat , viz . , astrometric single - measurement uncertainty ( 0.80@xmath35noise , 0.05@xmath35floor , 5-year mission , plus rv observations with 1 m/s accuracy for 15years ) .",
    "we found that terrestrial - mass , habitable - zone planets ( @xmath85 earths ) were detected with about the same efficiency whether they were alone in the system or if there were several other giant - mass , long - period planets ( @xmath85 jupiters ) present .",
    "the reason for this result is that signals with unique frequencies are well separated from each other , with little cross - talk . the number of planets per system ranged from 1 to 11 , with a median of 3 .",
    "the snr value of 5.8 value was predicted by @xcite for a false alarm probability ( fap ) of less than 1% , and verified in our simulations .",
    "the completeness and reliability to detect planets was better than 90% for all planets , where the comparison is with those planets that should have been detected according to a cramer - rao estimate @xcite of the mission noise .",
    "the cramer - rao estimates of uncertainty in the parameters of mass , semi - major axis , inclination , and eccentricity were consistent with the `` observed '' estimates of each : 3% for planet mass , @xmath86 for inclination and 0.02 for eccentricity .",
    "* radial velocity screening . * to solve unambiguously for giant planets with periods longer than 5yrs , it is necessary to have a ground rv survey for 15yrs of the 200 selected target star , at the presently available accuracy of 1 m/s .",
    "more than 80% of our targets are already being observed by rv , but the observations of the rest of them should start soon , well before the whole neat data is available .",
    "the capability of ground based rv surveys , despite their impressive near - term potential to obtain accuracies better than 1 m/s , is not sufficient to detect terrestrial planets in the hz of f , g and k stars .",
    "formally , an accuracy of 0.05 m/s is required to see an edge - on earth mass planet at 1@xmath87from a solar - mass star with snr=5 ( semi - amplitude = 0.13 m/s ) , which might be achievable instrumentally , but is stopped in most cases by the impact of stellar activity on rv accuracy .",
    "it is necessary to find particularly `` quiet '' stars , but they are a minority ( few percents ) and can not provide a full sample .",
    "furthermore , the ambiguity in physical mass associated with the signal coming only from the radial component of the stellar reflex motion ( @xmath88 ambiguity ) requires additional information to determine the physical mass and relative inclination in complex planetary systems . in some , but not all cases , limits are possible , and one can argue statistically that 90% of systems should be oriented such that the physical planet mass is within a factor of two of the mass found in rv .",
    "however , for finding a small number of potential future targets for direct detection and spectroscopy , an absolute determination that the mass is earth - like is required as well as an exhaustive inventory of the planets around stars in our neighborhood .",
    "* flexibility of objectives to upgrades / downgrades of the mission . * one of the strengths of neat is its flexibility , the possibility to adjust the size of the instrument with impacts on the science that are not prohibitive .",
    "the size of the neat mission could be reduced ( or increased ) with a direct impact on the accessible number of targets but not in an abrupt way .",
    "for instance , for same amount of integration time and number of maneuvers , the options listed in table [ tab : scaling ] are possible , with impacts on the number of stars that can be investigated down to 0.5 and 1 earth mass , and on the mass of the instrument , required fuel for maneuvers , and therefore cost .",
    "the time necessary to achieve a given precision depends on the mass limit that we want to reach : going from 0.5@xmath13to 1@xmath13requires twice less precision and therefore 4 times less observing time allowing a smaller telescope .",
    "there is room for adjustment keeping in mind that one wants to survey the neighborhood with the smallest mass limit possible and a typical number of targets of @xmath89 .",
    "* optical aberrations . *",
    "neat uses a very simple telescope optical design . a 1-m diameter clear aperture off - axis parabola , with an off - axis distance of 1 m and a 40 m focal length .",
    "the focal plane is at the prime focus .",
    "the telescope is diffraction limited at the center of the field , where the target stars will be observed , but coma produces some field dependent aberrations . at the mean position of the reference stars",
    ", @xmath90 away from the center of the field , the coma produces a _ steady _",
    "23% increase of the point spread function ( psf ) width and an 8@xmath42centroid offset .",
    "the impact remains low since we are looking at differential effects .",
    "* centroid measurements .",
    "* they consist of two steps : the determination of the stellar centroid on each ccd during 57s and then the calibration of the relative position of the ccds during 3s thanks to the metrology .",
    "the metrology determines also the response map of the detectors . as in the normal approach to precision astrometry with ccds",
    ", we perform a least - square fit of a template psf to the pixelated data .",
    "psf knowledge error leads to systematic errors in the conventional centroid estimation .",
    "we have developed an accurate centroid estimation algorithm by reconstructing the psf from well sampled ( above nyquist frequency ) pixelated images . in the limit of an ideal focal plane array",
    "whose pixels have identical response function ( no inter - pixel variation ) , this method can estimate centroid displacement between two 32x32 images to sub - micropixel accuracy .",
    "inter - pixel response variations exist in real ccds , which we calibrate by measuring the pixel response of each pixel in fourier space . capturing inter - pixel variations of pixel response to the third order terms in the power series expansion ,",
    "we have shown with simulated data that the centroid displacement estimation is accurate to a few micro - pixels .",
    "* stability of the primary mirror . *",
    "the primary optic will be made of zerodur / ule with a temperature coefficient better than @xmath91/k with an optics thickness @xmath92 cm and the effective temperature and temperature gradients are kept stable to @xmath93k over the mirror , the optic is then stable to @xmath94 nm ( @xmath95 ) during the 5yr mission .",
    "we have simulated two images , one at the center of the field that is a perfect airy function and one at the edge of the field that has a @xmath96 coma .",
    "we added also wavefront errors with a conservative rms value of @xmath97 . with the new wavefronts , we calculated the change in the differential astrometry bias caused by both pixelation and changing wavefronts .",
    "while the wavefront deviations to optimal shape caused a centroid shift of @xmath98 ( @xmath99 pixels ) , differential errors remained less than @xmath100 ( @xmath101 pixels ) .    * ccd damage in l2 environment .",
    "* ccds , like most semiconductors , suffer damage in radiation environments such as encountered by space missions .",
    "one particular performance parameter , charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) , degrades with known consequences on the efficiency of science missions like gaia .",
    "the reduced cte is caused generally by prompt particle events ( ppe ) , including solar protons and cosmic rays , colliding with the ccd silicon lattice and causing damages to the silicon lattice .",
    "this leads to the formation of so - called traps which can capture photo - electrons and release them again after some time .",
    "this results in signal loss and distortion of the psf shape .",
    "the latter leads to systematic errors in the image location due to a mismatch between the ideal psf shape and the actual image shape . for gaia",
    ", this effect of radiation damage is a major contributor to the error budget and extensive research and laboratory tests have been done in order to understand better the radiation damage effects and to develop approaches in both hardware and data processing to mitigate the negative impact .",
    "however , there are a number of important differences between neat and gaia which justify the assumption that radiation damage effects will play a much smaller role : i ) neat looks for extended periods at very bright stars compared to gaia in which the stars continuously move on the ccd . also , unlike gaia , neat will not be operated in time - delayed integration mode .",
    "in addition the ccds are regularly illuminated by the laser light from the metrology system .",
    "this means that in general the signal level in the ccd pixels is high which will keep the traps with long ( @xmath102s ) release time constants filled and effectively inactive .",
    "ii ) neat also does not suffer from the varying ccd illumination history that a scanning mission like gaia necessarily encounters .",
    "this illumination history is in fact one of the major complicating factors for gaia .",
    "finally , iii ) neat uses much smaller ccds than gaia and in addition has four read - out nodes , thus reducing the number of charge transfer steps and mitigating the effects of radiation damage .",
    "the one concern for the neat case is the presence of traps with release time constants that are of the order of several times the charge transfer period between pixels . in the case of neat the transfer period averages tens of @xmath72s and from laboratory tests with e2v ccds , carried out in the context of the gaia project , traps with time constants of 10100@xmath72s",
    "are known to exist .",
    "if these traps dominate at the operating temperature of the neat ccds they could lead to subtle psf image shape distortions and thus image location biases . from the gaia experience , it is known that such image shape distortions can be handled in the post - processing by a careful modeling of the effects of radiation damage on the psf image .",
    "a similar strategy , building on the gaia heritage , can be employed for neat .        * ccd / metrology tests in the lab . * in the absence of optical errors , the major error sources are associated with the focal plane : ( 1 ) motions of the ccd pixels , which have to be monitored to @xmath101 pixels every 60s , i.e.  0.03 nm ; ( 2 ) measurements of the centroid of the star images with @xmath103 pixel accuracy .",
    "we have set up technology testbeds to demonstrate that we can achieve these objectives .",
    "the technology objective for ( 1 ) has almost been reached and the technology demonstration for ( 2 ) is underway and should be completed soon .",
    "latest results with no metrology nor qe 6-parameter calibration have been obtained from the ccd / metrology test bench ( fig .",
    "[ fig : testbed - results ] ) .",
    "allen deviation of the centroid location for one artificial star `` a '' projected on the ccd and allen deviation of the differential centroid location for two artificial stars a and b projected on the ccd are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : testbed - results ] ( left ) .",
    "one can see that star a moves on the ccd by a few hundred micro - pixels at time scale greater than 1 second , but that the differential position of the two stars is better @xmath104 pixel at 100s integration time . on fig .",
    "[ fig : testbed - results ] ( right ) , the allen deviation of the differential centroid location for two artificial stars projected on the ccd is plotted , concatenating data from 38 runs , a minimum of @xmath105-pixels at about 10min before differential drift dominated .",
    "this data shows that we are only a factor 10 from the final goal and that differential metrology at intervals of minutes is required to reach it .",
