    "the famous hubble expansion drives more distant objects to recede faster from us .",
    "recent observations of supernovae argue that this expansion is in fact accelerating , implying an existence of dark energy with negative pressure @xcite .",
    "this dark energy , which contributes two third of energy density in the present universe , is mysterious in its physical origin .",
    "precise measurements of its time evolution will be crucial to uncover the identity of this energy component .",
    "one of most promising probes to measure the dark energy is a standard ruler called baryon acoustic oscillations in large - scale clustering @xcite    baryon acoustic oscillations ( hereafter bao ) arise from sound waves that propagated in the hot plasma of tightly coupled photons and baryons in the early universe . as the universe expands and cools",
    ", photons finally decouple from baryons 400,000 years after the big bang , with the sound waves revealed as the acoustic oscillations in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( hereafter cmb ) @xcite .",
    "the equivalent but attenuated feature exists in the clustering of matter , as baryons fall into dark matter potential well after the recombination @xcite .",
    "these were recently detected in galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "good cmb anisotropy data provides the absolute physical scale for these baryonic peaks ; comparing this to the observed location of the baryonic peaks in the two - point correlation function or power spectrum provides measurements of cosmological distance scale . clustering in the transverse direction probes the angular diameter distance , and clustering in the line - of - sight direction probes the hubble parameter .",
    "the cosmological distance scale as a function of redshift is then the record of the expansion history of the universe , which in turn measures the evolution of dark energy density .",
    "many studies have been devoted to estimations of precision on cosmological distance scale achievable using the bao from future galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "a common scheme is to assume the gaussian statistical errors on the power spectrum , which are constructed straightforward from the finite volume of the survey and the incomplete sampling of the underlying density field with galaxies @xcite , and then to propagate these errors to constrain the errors on cosmological parameters including cosmological distance scale whether by using monte - carlo simulations or using analytic method such as a fisher matrix formalism . in @xcite",
    ", we used a fisher matrix formalism to show that the bao from future galaxy redshift surveys can constrain the cosmological distance scale to percent level precision , thereby providing robust measurements of present - day dark energy density and its time - dependence that are comparable to future type ia supernova surveys .    the most important element in these methods , other than the survey specifications , is how to include the effects of nonlinear structure formation , which depends on redshift as well as bias .",
    "the primary nonlinear effect on the standard ruler test is that the bao signature is reduced with time by the nonlinear growth of density fields into present - day structures @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear mode - coupling also alters the overall shape of the power spectrum by increasing the small - scale power relative to the linear growth of power spectrum ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at the same time , this mode - coupling increases statistical errors above our gaussian approximations @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear effects first appear on small scales and then proceed to larger scales , tracing the hierarchical formation of structures .",
    "nonlinear redshift distortions and nonlinear galaxy bias can further degrade the bao ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and modify the statistical variance .    in @xcite , we used a sharp wavenumber cut to exclude the nonlinear wavenumbers from the fisher matrix formalism .",
    "that is , we treated all wavenumbers up to a certain threshold as linear and excluded all larger wavenumbers from our calculations , while the threshold varied depending on redshift .",
    "our choice of linear wavenumbers was based on the magnitude of underlying mass density fluctuations rather than direct estimations of degradation of baryonic signature with redshift , as we did not have any means to estimate the latter without n - body simulations .",
    "in addition , the effects of bias or redshift distortions on the bao were too ambiguous to parameterize and include in the fisher matrix .",
    "however , the nonlinear effect does not turn on sharply with wavenumber but instead appears gradually . in @xcite , we used n - body simulations to study the effect of nonlinear growth , bias , and redshift distortions on the appearance of the bao . while we have shown in that paper",
    "that our choice of linear scales in @xcite reasonably represents the amount of standard ruler information at different redshift , we still lacked a quantitative description of the gradual erasure on the bao as a function of redshift , bias , and redshift distortions .",
    "recently , a quantitative model has been provided by @xcite . in a two - point correlation function ,",
    "the bao signature is an excess of pairs separated by its characteristic scale of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite models the nonlinear process of erasing the bao signature as differential motions or lagrangian displacements of these pairs of tracers . using the n - body simulations from @xcite",
    ", we estimated the amount of differential motions caused by nonlinear growth , halo bias , and redshift distortions at different redshifts .",
    "we then showed that the nonlinear erasure of the bao signature is successfully modeled by approximating these displacement field as gaussian and convolving this lagrangian displacement distribution with the bao peak in the two - point correlation function , or multiplying the linear power spectrum by the fourier transform of the gaussian function .",
    "as noted in @xcite , estimating the lagrangian displacement fields with a reasonable precision does not require a simulation as large as estimating the degradation in the bao signature does : lagrangian displacements are calculated from all pairs separated by @xmath0 , while the bao depend on the small number of excess pairs at that separation .    in this paper , we use the lagrangian displacement distribution calculated from @xcite to modify the fisher matrix formalism presented in @xcite so as to correctly reflect the gradual loss of standard ruler information from the bao in scale and in time due to not only nonlinear growth but also bias and redshift distortions .",
    "we isolate the cosmological distance information from the bao more strictly than in @xcite , i.e. , without information from @xcite test or from the broad - band shape of power spectrum , and derive distance error estimates using the fisher matrix calculations .",
    "we show that the full , 12-dimensional ( for one redshift bin ) fisher matrix in @xcite can be contracted to a 2-dimensional or even 1-dimensional covariance matrix of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with physically motivated approximations .",
    "we present the resulting fitting formula , for errors from the full dimensional fisher matrix , based on the reduced 2-dimensional covariance matrix , which is a function of survey volume , galaxy number density , and parameterized nonlinearity .",
    "note that the effect of bias and redshift distortions on the bao is now straightforward to parameterize as an increase in lagrangian displacement field and easy to mingle into the fisher matrix calculation .",
    "we show that the application of the formula extends to the photometric redshift surveys .",
    "this fitting formula will save considerable amount of computational efforts in forecasting distance errors for future galaxy surveys .",
    "we compare these results with distance constraints from a @xmath3 analysis of the full n - body results from @xcite .",
    "our fitting formula differs from @xcite in many details , such as the different treatments of nonlinear degradation of standard ruler test and ours having a structure based on physically motivated model .    in ",

    "in this section , we construct the fisher matrix that assesses the amount of distance information available exclusively from using the bao as a standard ruler .",
    "this enables us to use the lagrangian displacement distribution @xcite to account for the nonlinear effects on baryonic peaks and therefore nonlinear effects on the distance precision .    assuming the likelihood function of the band powers of galaxy power spectrum to be gaussian , the fisher matrix is approximately @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the observed power spectrum at @xmath6",

    "this formulation assumes that the density field is gaussian and that boundary effects are not important . the second equality in equation ( [ eq : veff ] )",
    "holds only if the comoving number density @xmath15 is constant in position , and the third equality assumes linear redshift distortions @xcite .    from @xcite ,",
    "the lagrangian displacement fields due to nonlinear growth and nonlinear redshift distortions at separation of @xmath16 can be approximated as an elliptical gaussian function . since most of the effect comes from the bulk flow , galaxy bias does not have much effect on lagrangian displacement .",

    "the redshift dependence enters because of the loss of information due to nonlinear effect , such as the erasure of baryonic features as well as the nonlinear growth of power at large wavenumber . in @xcite ,",

[ [ eq : surpbao ] ] ) , we can remove the redshift dependent @xmath35 .",
    "we set @xmath40 for all redshifts and change @xmath18 and @xmath17 to account for the erasure of baryonic features .    as we seek to isolate the information from the acoustic scale , we attach the exponential suppression in equation ( [ eq : surpbao ] ) to the full power spectrum when computing @xmath41 .",
    "this means that we are removing all information , baryonic and non - baryonic , from smaller scales , where the broad - band shape of the power spectrum might give distance information .",
    "moreover , when we compute the derivatives of @xmath42 , we take the exponential factor in equation ( [ eq : surpbao ] ) outside of the derivatives .",

    "there are two sources of such information : first , from the @xcite test ( hereafter ap test ) using angular anisotropy of power spectrum , and second , from the power spectrum not following a simple power law .",
    "first , at a given @xmath38 , both the redshift distortions from large scale infall and the cosmological distortions give rise to angular anisotropies in power .",
    "when the linear redshift distortion parameter @xmath13 becomes very small , both distortions converge to an identical angular signature , a quadratic in @xmath7 , causing the effect of redshift distortions to be degenerate from the effect of @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", the distance information from the ap test will be suppressed .",
    "however , when @xmath13 is non - negligible , as we assume a specific angular dependence of redshift distortions ( e.g. , linear redshift distortions ) , the two effects can be in principle distinguished as both distortions have different higher multiples , and we can therefore isolate the cosmological distance information on @xmath45 ( i.e. , the ap test ) from the effect of @xmath13 .",
    "second , if the galaxy power spectrum follows a simple power law without any preferred scale , the cosmological distortions remain degenerate from the redshift distortions for a negligible @xmath13 .",
    "however , the galaxy power spectrum contains another preferred scale , the horizon scale at the epoch of matter - radiation equality .",
    "this effect produces much broader feature in power spectrum , but in principle can provide an extra standard ruler @xcite .",
    "however , we consider both of these sources of information less robust than the bao . for the ap test",
    ", we do not believe we understand the quasilinear and nonlinear behavior of redshift distortions very accurately . for the broadband shape of the power spectrum",
    ", the resulting distance information will be susceptible to the systematic effect such as tilt , nonlinear bias , or nonlinear growth in power .",

    "we remove this by computing the fisher matrix @xmath46 with @xmath47 to produce a reasonable cmb information . ] and subtracting it from the fisher matrix @xmath48 with the fiducial @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , in order to remove any distance information from a presumed form of redshift distortions , we assume @xmath50 in the derivatives in equation ( [ eq : fullfij ] ) in computing both @xmath51 and the fiducial fisher matrix . that is , the angular ap test is removed .",

    "the reason why we only need to modify @xmath52 , whether due to the nonlinear redshift distortions or due to photometric redshift errors , is because the resulting exponential suppression in power spectrum ( @xmath178 ) not only decreases the signal but also decreases the variance from the cdm power spectrum in the line - of - sight direction .",

    "in fact , it is more conservative to put this term into @xmath18 than it is to put into @xmath185 , because while both cases decrease the signal by the same amount , the latter case also decreases the noise by the same amount while the former does not .",
    "therefore , we do not take any steps to isolate thermal velocities in the lagrangian displacements and move that contribution to @xmath185 .",
    "we simply reserve @xmath90 for the inclusion of observational uncertainties such as spectroscopic or photometric redshift errors .      when @xmath186 and @xmath175 , the nonlinear exponential damping becomes isotropic , and the 2-d fisher matrix ( eq .  [",
