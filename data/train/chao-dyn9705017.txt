    "control of chaos or of the transition to chaos has been , in recent years , a very active field ( see for example ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several techniques were developed and tested , mostly for low dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "the challenge lies now on finding out whether these techniques extend to infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "a first aspect preventing a simple extrapolation of the finite - dimensional techniques is the fact that only a small subset of variables ( or some integrated collective variable ) is acessible to measurement .",
    "likewise the variables on which one may act for controlling purposes are even more limited .",
    "a second aspect is that , rather than to stabilize an unstable periodic orbit ( a single mode ) , what one aims in general is to suppress a continuous set of unstable modes , or to stabilize a particular collective mode and , at the same time , prevent all other modes from developing . in this sense",
    "the problem is no longer a standard control problem to be handled by pole placement , sliding mode or other standard technique .",
    "instead , as suggested by the problem discussed in this paper the control problem amounts to the solution of a generalized integro - differential eigenvalue problem .",
    "a problem of both theoretical and practical importance is the control of the transition from laminar to turbulent motion in a boundary layer flow .",
    "i deal with this problem mostly as an example and prototype of the kind of questions and mathematical framework to be expected in the control of chaos for infinite - dimensional complex systems .",
    "however for the benefit of the reader less familiar with aerodynamical issues i have included a few remarks on the physical and technological context of the problem .    by delaying the laminar to turbulent transition , an order of magnitude reduction in the skin friction drag",
    "is achieved .",
    "the technological benefits that may be derived from this reduction , led to the proposal of several methods for the control of the boundary layer transition .",
    "they are both of passive and active type and include pressure gradient control , wall suction , wall temperature control , polymer coating , compliant walls , etc .    in passive type control@xcite @xcite ,",
    "the aim is either to induce a modification of the curvature of the velocity profile , or to break the eddies and absorb their energy .    on the other hand",
    "the active control methods , that have been proposed@xcite , aim at cancelling the growth of the tollmien - schlichting ( ts ) waves , a known precursor of the transition instability .",
    "this is achieved by creating a disturbance of opposite phase to cancel the ts waves .",
    "the wave cancelling disturbance may be created , for example , by modulated suction and blowing or by mechanical microactuators .",
    "this control requires an accurate set of sensors and actuators .",
    "the reaction time of the actuators is critical to achieve control , especially if one aims at the feedback cancellation of nonlinear effects .",
    "the fact that some of the spatial growing modes have high frequencies , leads to the suspicion that mechanical sensors and actuators , even if highly miniaturized , will have an hard time to deal with the high frequency instabilities that are known to be present in the transition .",
    "greater speed and flexibility would be achieved were it possible to act on the flow by electromagnetic fields . with the possible exception of electrolytes like seawater ,",
    "a direct electromagnetic action on the unmodified fluid@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite does not seem possible .",
    "however , even for neutral fluids , improved control of the boundary layer flow might be achieved by injecting in the leading edge of the airfoil a stream of ionized gas , creating a thin ionized layer which might then be acted upon by electromagnetic fields . in ref.@xcite a detailed discussion is carried out of the effect of a streamwise directed electric field on the velocity profile of an ionized boundary layer , taking into consideration the fact that an injected stream of ionized gas leads to a nonuniform charge profile .",
    "the study establishes reference values and design estimates for the electric fields and ionization densities required for a significant change of the velocity profile .    in the present paper a methodology is studied to assess the possibilities of electromagnetic control of the ts  precursor waves .",
    "usually one thinks of active control in terms of laminarizing the boundary layer flow .",
    "however the opposite situation may also occur because , for example , in stalling prone situations it might be useful to induce turbulence to avoid separation .",
    "then the fast reaction time of electromagnetic control might also be an asset .",
    "consider the navier - stokes equation @xmath0 for an incompressible ionized fluid in an external electromagnetic field @xmath1 in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates , denote by @xmath2 the streamwise , the normal and the spanwise components of the physical velocity field @xmath3 .",
    "define also reference quantities and adimensional variables @xmath4 typical values for the reference quantities , as used before@xcite , are @xmath5 m s@xmath6 , @xmath7 m , @xmath8 m , @xmath9 kg m@xmath10 , @xmath11 v cm@xmath6 , @xmath13 @xmath14c cm@xmath10 , @xmath16 m@xmath17 s@xmath6 . then r@xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are small quantities .    expressing ( [ 2.1 ] ) in the adimensional variables ( [ 2.3 ] ) , assuming that the product @xmath21 of the airfoil curvature times the boundary layer width is small and neglecting terms of order @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 one is left with @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the reference values above )    the aim is to study the stability of the steady state ( laminar ) solutions of the above equations with regard to the precursor waves that develop in the transition region .",
    "therefore the variables are decomposed into steady state ( @xmath30 ) and fluctuating components ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 and one looks for normal mode solutions of the form @xmath33 with a similar , but @xmath34independent , form for the electric field    @xmath35    from the control point of view this implies the capability to have the electric field react to the fluctuating velocity field with the same frequency and wavelength , but eventually with some delay represented by the phase of the complex amplitude @xmath36 . to have this feedback response ,",
    "a distributed set of sensors should be available on the surface of the airfoil .",
    "the sensors , of course , can not measure the velocity field itself but only some integrated effect , observable at the coordinate @xmath37 ( see below ) .    in the transition region",
    "the quasiparallel hypothesis for the stationary solution is a good approximation .",
    "namely @xmath38 .",
    "this holds for example for one of the scaling solutions in ref.@xcite @xmath39 for @xmath40  and a charge distribution profile @xmath41 it is the stability and controllability of this solution that is going to be studied .    by differentiating eqs.([2.4 ] ) the pressure terms may be eliminated .",
    "then , keeping only the linear terms in the fluctuating fields and using ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) , one obtains @xmath42 with the boundary conditions @xmath43 the last three boundary conditions are obtained from the continuity equation @xmath44 and the last equation in ( [ 2.4 ] ) .    in situations where",
    "the spanwise fluctuations may be neglected , the flow becomes two - dimensional and a stream function may be defined for the waves @xmath45 then the stability equation is @xmath46 which is a simplified version of the orr - sommerfeld equation with a driving term .",
    "the simplification arises from the fact that terms of order @xmath47 and @xmath48 have been neglected . in this form",
    "the equation may be integrated once and reduced to a third order problem ( see below ) .",
    "consider first the spanwise stability of the scaling solution ( [ 2.8 ] ) without control ( @xmath49 ) . the second equation in ( [ 2.10 ] )",
    "may be integrated once and the integration constant set to zero using the boundary conditions ( [ 2.11 ] ) . using the scaling solution ( [ 2.8 ] ) for @xmath50 and changing coordinates to @xmath51 one obtains @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with boundary conditions @xmath55 discretizing the @xmath56 interval , the calculation of the largest growing modes becomes an algebraic generalized eigenvalue problem which is dealt with by the qz algorithm . in fig.1a one",
    "plots the largest value of re@xmath57 for real @xmath58 and in fig.1b the largest value of re@xmath59 for real @xmath60 .",
    "all modes having negative real parts , the conclusion is that the scaling solution is both space- and time- spanwise stable",
    ". therefore we may take @xmath61 and use , for the streamwise stability , the stream function stability equation ( [ 2.14 ] ) .    for the scaling solution ( [ 2.8 ] ) , with the same change of variables , neglecting the term in @xmath62 because @xmath63 is a small quantity , integrating once the equation and fixing the integration constant with the boundary conditions , the result is the equation @xmath64 with boundary conditions @xmath65 let first @xmath66 ( uncontrolled equation ) . using as before a finite difference method and the qz algorithm with the boundary conditions imposed as three of the equations in the algebraic system , one obtains , for the largest value of re@xmath67 and real @xmath58 , the results shown in fig.2 .",
    "it means that there is a range of frequencies for which there is spatial growth of the streamwise fluctuations .",
    "therefore the scaling solution is spatially unstable .    to derive a controlled equation one has to realize that the only physical quantities , that it is reasonable to assume to be observable , are the pressure fluctuations on the airfoil or the integrated effect of the electrical current as seen at the surface of the airfoil .",
    "pressure fluctuations may be detected by a distributed set of microphones and the integrated electrical current fluctuations are essentially the induced magnetic field fluctuations on the spanwise direction .",
    "for definiteness i will assume that a set of sensors is available to measure the effect of the electrical current fluctuations . to achieve control this measurement",
    "is used to modulate a variable component of the applied electric field .",
    "that is @xmath68 with @xmath69 a complex proportionality constant , the meaning of the phase being the control delay .",
    "then , the controlled equation is @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "the controllability problem amounts to find out whether all eigenvalues have negative real parts in the integro - differential problem defined by eq.([3.7 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath72 , the frequency for which the largest re@xmath73 is at its maximum . for real @xmath74",
    ", fig.3 shows that for @xmath75 the largest mode has spatial decay , hence the solution becomes stable . for the results in fig.4 , let @xmath76 with @xmath77 and variable phase @xmath78 .",
    "one sees that there is a range of phase delays which stabilize the solution and , conversely , outside this range the solution is strongly unstable .",
    "stabilization of a stationary configuration in an infinite - dimensional system involves the study of infinitely many disturbance modes , some of which may grow in time and space .",
    "in addition , the measurable observables , to which some local control may react , involve the integrated effect of many variables .",
    "therefore the mathematical structure of the problem to be solved is expected to be , as in this example , an integro - differential generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "the unstabilizing disturbances that need to be controlled in extended systems have in general a nontrivial space - time structure .",
    "therefore a set of distributed sensors and actuators is needed to achieve a space - time controlling action .",
    "the fact that , in practice , only global integrated variables are observable , restricts the feedback control to these variables only . therefore , for extended systems",
    ", there is no guarantee that control will be achieved in general and success is only to be expected in particular favorable cases .",
    "the laminar to turbulent transition , in the boundary layer , begins with the appearance of downstream moving waves which at first grow slowly and may be described by a linearized equation . after reaching a certain amplitude however ,",
    "the waves develop strong three - dimensional structures and nonlinearities and a rapid transition to turbulence becomes unavoidable .",
    "therefore , if effective control is to be achieved , it is essential to have a fast and locally accurate feedback to tame the instabilities before the spanwise differential amplification of the ts waves begins to occur . because it is probably very difficult to obtain the required speed and accuracy with mechanical microactuators ,",
    "electromagnetic controlling schemes seem worth to explore .",
