    "quantum mechanical scattering in systems with complex internal dynamics has been a subject of intensive research activity for a number of years .",
    "the interest was motivated by various areas of physics , ranging from nuclear @xcite , atomic@xcite and molecular @xcite physics , to mesoscopics @xcite , quantum chaos @xcite , and classical wave scattering @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in this subject was renewed due to technological developments in quantum optics associated with the construction of new type of lasers @xcite and the experimental investigation of atoms in optical lattices @xcite .    the most fundamental object which characterizes the process of quantum scattering is the scattering matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath1 relates the amplitudes of waves that enter and leave a scattering region . of great interest are the statistical properties of the poles of the @xmath1 matrix .",
    "they determine the conductance fluctuations of a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite or the current relaxation @xcite .",
    "the poles of the @xmath1 matrix are related to resonance states occurring at complex energies @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the position and @xmath4 the width of the resonance .",
    "resonances correspond to  eigenstates \" of the open system that decay in time due to the coupling to the  outside world \" .    for chaotic systems",
    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) is applicable and the distributions of resonance widths @xmath0 is known .",
    "a review can be found in ref .",
    "( see also ref . ) . as the disorder increases ,",
    "the system becomes diffusive and the deviations from rmt increase drastically . for low dimensional random systems in the metallic regime",
    "the distribution of resonances @xmath5 was found recently @xcite .",
    "for the strongly disordered limit , where localization dominates , @xmath5 was investigated by various groups @xcite as well . at the same time",
    "an attempt to understand systems at critical conditions was undertaken in refs . and .",
    "the latter deals with random systems of higher dimensions , the most prominent of which is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) anderson model .",
    "it undergoes a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) with increasing strength of disorder @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend our previous analysis on the 3d anderson model @xcite and study the distribution of resonance widths as we change the disorder strength . based on the analysis of @xmath0 we propose a new method to locate the mit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : basics ] the 3d anderson model and the scattering formalism are introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss the consequences of localization in the distribution of resonance widths in the diffusive and localized regimes as well as at the mit and show the numerical results supporting our arguments . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scale ] we investigate a new method for determining and analyzing the emergence of the mit and propose a scaling theory near the critical point .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the anderson model with diagonal disorder on a 3d cubic lattice is described by the tight - binding hamiltonian ( tbh ) @xmath6 labels all the @xmath7 sites of the cubic lattice , while the second sum is taken over all nearest - neighbor pairs @xmath8 on the lattice .",
    "the on - site potential @xmath9 for @xmath10 is independently and identically distributed with probability @xmath11 .",
    "we use three different distributions for the random potential : ( a ) a box distribution , i.e. , the @xmath9 are uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath12 $ ] ; ( b ) a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath13 ; and ( c ) a cauchy distribution @xmath14 . for the system defined by eq .",
    "( [ tbh ] ) the mit for @xmath15 occurs for @xmath16 with ( a ) @xmath17 , ( b ) @xmath18 , and ( c ) @xmath19 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "then , for @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) the system is in the metallic ( insulating ) regime .",

    "its elements are equal to zero or @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the coupling strength . below , unless stated otherwise , we will always consider the case @xmath36 .",

    "( [ smatrix ] ) and ( [ poleseq ] ) it is clear that the formation of resonances is closely related to the dynamics in the scattering region , governed by @xmath41 .    in order to investigate the distributions of resonance widths we used samples with @xmath42 as a maximum size . for better statistics",
    "a considerable number of different disorder realizations was considered . in all cases we had at least 10 000 data for statistical processing .",
    "when the disorder strength @xmath43 is smaller than @xmath44 , but still large enough so that the mean free path is smaller than the system size , the system is in the metallic regime .",
    "recently , a lot of research activity was devoted to the understanding of the statistical properties of various physical quantities ( such as conductance , local density of states , current relaxation times ) in finite - size random systems in the metallic regime .",
    "the outcome of these studies indicated that the tails of these distribution functions show large deviations from the universal random matrix theory ( rmt ) results , expected to be valid @xcite in the limit of infinite dimensionless conductance @xmath45 . here",
    ", @xmath46 is the typical inverse time ( thouless time ) that an excitation needs to diffuse ( with diffusion coefficient @xmath47 ) in order to reach the boundary of a system , with linear size @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the mean level spacing .",
    "the origin of these deviations was found to be related to the existence of eigenstates which are unusually localized around a center of localization .",
    "these states are precursors of the anderson localization and were termed _ prelocalized _",
    "states @xcite . in 3d conductors they have sharp amplitude peaks on the top of a homogeneous background @xcite .",
    "we start our analysis by investigating the effects of prelocalized states in the distribution of resonance widths .",
    "it is natural to expect that these states with localization centers at the bulk of the sample are affected only weakly when opening the system at the boundaries .",
    "therefore , prelocalized states decay very slowly to the continuum leading us to the conclusion that the corresponding resonance widths ( inverse lifetime ) @xmath50 are smaller than the mean level spacing @xmath51 . hence , assuming the validity of standard first order perturbation theory ( that can be applied if the coupling of the sample to the leads is weak , @xmath52 ) we get @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the wavefunction intensity of a pre - localized state at the boundary of the sample . at the same time",

    "( [ difgammas ] ) , obtained using perturbation theory , holds even for strong coupling .",
    "indeed , the reported data for the 3d anderson model in the diffusive regime , plotted as @xmath60 vs @xmath61 , shows a linear behaviour .",
    "this comes as a surprise since in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we have considered perfect coupling , @xmath36 .",
    "differences in slope correspond to different dimensionless conductances @xmath62 induced by the varying values of disorder strengths .",
    "next , we turn to the analysis of @xmath0 for @xmath63 . in order to go on",
    "we need to recall that the inverse of @xmath50 represents the quantum lifetime of a particle in a resonant state escaping into the leads .",
    "moreover , we assume that the particles are uniformly distributed inside the sample and spread until they reach the boundary where they are absorbed . then , we can associate the corresponding lifetimes with the time @xmath64 a particle needs to reach the boundaries , when starting a distance @xmath65 away .",
    "the relative number of states that require a time @xmath66 in order to reach the boundaries ( or equivalently the number of states with @xmath67 ) is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the volume populated by all particles with lifetimes @xmath66 .",

    "equation ( [ gamlargedif ] ) is valid as long as the leads are attached to the boundary of the sample .    here , it is interesting to point out that a different way of opening the system might lead to a different power law behavior for @xmath0 .",
    "such a situation can be realized if instead of opening the system at the boundaries we attach one lead somewhere in the sample .",
    "in such a case we have @xmath74 leading to @xmath75 where we used @xmath76 .",
    "the above results are correct for any number of leads @xmath77 such that the ratio @xmath78 scales as @xmath79 .    if , on the other hand , we attach a single lead to the boundary of the sample we obtain @xmath80 this behavior is due to the fact that the decay takes place at the surface , leading to a situation similar to that of a 2d system @xcite .",

    "we observe a good agreement with the expected behavior in all cases .      when the disorder strength @xmath43 is larger than @xmath44 the system is in the localized regime .",
    "in this regime the eigenfunctions are exponentially localized in space and , as a consequence , transmission is inhibited and the system behaves as an insulator .",
    "various groups @xcite had investigated the resonance width distribution of low dimensional random media in the localized regime during the last years . in the region of exponentially narrow resonances @xmath81 the distribution was found to be log - normal , i.e. , @xmath82 , \\quad   \\gamma < \\gamma_0 \\ .\\ ] ] this result is analogous to the conductance distribution of localized systems . equation ( [ locres2 ] ) essentially relies on two assumptions : first , that eigenfunction components are randomly distributed with no long - range correlations ; and second , that they are exponentially localized with a normal distribution of localization lengths .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the same arguments leading to eq .",
    "( [ locres2 ] ) applies as well for high - dimensional random media like the 3d anderson model in the localized regime .",

    "the region of large @xmath50 values is essentially determined by the coupling to the continuum , so it should be model - dependent .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to assume that the number of resonances involved is constant , of order @xmath88 , and therefore the extreme tail of the distribution should subside at large @xmath48 at the rate @xmath89 .",
    "let us finally note that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath90 the probability of finding an eigenstate at any finite distance from the boundary is equal to zero .",
    "thus the distribution of the resonance widths in this case approaches a delta function centered at zero .",
    "the mit , where @xmath16 , is characterized by several _ critical _ properties : the level statistics acquires a scale - independent form @xcite while the eigenfunctions show strong fluctuations on all length scales and obey multifractal distributions @xcite .    in ref .",
    "it was found that @xmath91 follows a new universal distribution , i.e. , independent of the microscopic details of the random potential and number of attached leads .",

    "one can relate the power - law decay ( [ mitgam ] ) to the anomalous diffusion at the mit .",

    "the body of the distribution function in all cases coincides and does not change its shape or width .",
    "of course , the far tail of this universal distribution develops better with increasing @xmath48 .",
    "the sharp peak appearing at the right is an artifact of our choice to neglect the energy dependence of @xmath29 .",

    "the following scaling hypothesis was therefore postulated in ref .",
    ": @xmath106 in the insulating phase ( @xmath21 ) the conductance of a sample with length @xmath48 behaves as @xmath107 due to the exponential localization of the eigenstates , and therefore we have @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
