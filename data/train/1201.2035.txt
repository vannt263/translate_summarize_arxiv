    "hysteresis is a common nonlinear phenomena that is present in diverse physical systems , such as piezo - actuator , ferromagnetic material and mechanical systems . from the perspective of input - output behavior",
    ", the hysteretic phenomena can be characterized into counterclockwise ( ccw ) input - output ( i / o ) dynamics @xcite , clockwise ( cw ) i / o dynamics @xcite , or even more complex i / o map ( such as , butterfly map @xcite ) . for example , backlash operator generates ccw i / o dynamics ; elastic - plastic operator generates cw i / o dynamics and preisach operator can have either ccw or cw i / o dynamics depending on the weight of the hysterons which are used in the preisach model @xcite .    in the recent work by angeli @xcite , the counterclockwise ( ccw ) i / o dynamics of a single - input single - output system is characterized by the following inequality @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the input signal and @xmath2 is the corresponding output signal .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the set of input signals for which @xmath2 exists and is well defined for all positive time .",
    "compare with the classical definition of passivity @xcite , it can be interpreted as the system is passive from the input @xmath1 to the time derivative of the corresponding output @xmath2 . in particular , : holds if there exists a function @xmath5 such that @xmath6 indeed , integrating : from @xmath7 to @xmath8 we obtain : .    correspondingly , clockwise ( cw ) i / o dynamics can be described by the following dissipation inequality @xmath9 the notions of counterclockwise ( ccw ) i / o and clockwise ( cw ) i / o are also discussed in @xcite .    in our previous results in @xcite , we show that for a certain class of duhem hysteresis operator @xmath10 , we can construct a function @xmath11 which satisfies @xmath12 this inequality immediately implies that such duhem hysteresis operator is dissipative with respect to the supply rate @xmath13 and has ccw input - output dynamics . the symbol @xmath14 in @xmath15 indicates the counterclockwise behavior of @xmath16 .    in this paper , as a dual extension to @xcite , we focus on the clockwise ( cw ) hysteresis operator where the supply rate is given by @xmath17 which is dual to the supply rate @xmath18 considered in @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the friction induced hysteresis phenomenon in the mechanical system which has cw i / o behavior from the input relative displacement to the output friction force .",
    "one may intuitively consider to reverse the input - output relation of the cw hysteresis operator for getting the ccw i / o behavior in the reverse i / o setting .",
    "however , this consideration has two drawbacks : 1 )",
    ". the reverse input - output pair may not be physically realizable ( this is related to the causality problem in the port - based modeling , such as , the bond graph modeling framework @xcite ) ; 2 )",
    ". the operator itself may not be invertible ( for example , if the output of the hysteresis operator can be saturated ) .    in theorem [ thm1 ] , we provide sufficient conditions on the underlying functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the duhem operator , such that it has cw i / o dynamics .",
    "roughly speaking , the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( as defined later in section 2 ) determine two possible different directions @xmath21 depending on whether the input @xmath1 is increasing or decreasing . by evaluating these two functions on two disjoint domains ( which are separated by an anhysteresis curve ) , we can determine whether it has cw i / o dynamics using theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "this is shown by constructing a function @xmath22 such that the following inequality @xmath23 holds .",
    "the function @xmath24 can also be related to the concept of available storage function from @xcite where , instead of using the standard supply rate @xmath25 , we use the cw supply rate @xmath26 as shown in proposition 1 in this paper .    the dissipativity property :",
    "can be further used in the stability analysis of the systems with cw hysteresis , such as , a second - order mechanical system with hysteretic friction as discussed in section 4.2 . as an illustrative example on the application of : , let us consider a mechanical system described by @xmath27 with the hysteresis operator @xmath16 satisfying the dahl model as follows @xmath28 where @xmath29 refers to the mass , @xmath30 refers to the displacement , @xmath31 is the applied force , @xmath32 describes the stiffness constant , @xmath33 represents the coulomb friction constant and @xmath34 is the initial condition of the dahl model ( see , for example , @xcite ) . by taking @xmath35 and @xmath36 as the state variables , we can rewrite this hysteretic system into state - space form as follows @xmath37 in section 4.1 , we obtain the function @xmath24 satisfying : explicitly and it is parameterized by @xmath38 and @xmath39 . using @xmath40 as a lyapunov function we have @xmath41 this inequality establishes that the closed loop system is passive from the applied force @xmath31 to the velocity @xmath42 .",
    "thus a simple propositional feedback @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , can guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the velocity @xmath42 to zero without having to know precisely the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
