    "it is a pleasure to present our results @xcite here in gatchina , where many of the fundamental ideas on the use of unitarity cutting rules perhaps originated @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , ( not too ) small-@xmath1 deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . on the free nucleon target ,",
    "the @xmath2 dipole will exchange a single gluon with the target and the recoiling nucleon debris will be in the color octet state . on a heavy nucleus target ,",
    "multiple gluon exchanges are enhanced by a new large parameter , the size of the nucleus . at the parton level",
    ", the final state of a typical nondiffractive event will now contain a certain number of color  excited nucleons . in the language of pomeron exchanges",
    ", each color  excited nucleon corresponds to a unitarity cut of a pomeron exchanged between the projectile @xmath3dipole and the nucleus .",
    "the partial cross sections associated with a fixed number of cut pomerons are called topological cross sections , and are important experimental observables . in the case of hard processes of interest to us , they contain information on the long  range rapidity correlations between forward or midrapidity jet / dijet production and multiproduction in the fragmentation region of the target nucleus .",
    "they are also closely related to the centrality of a collision , a fundamental concept in nuclear interactions .",
    "with multiple color excitations of the nucleus .",
    "the amplitude receives contributions from processes with interactions before and after the virtual decay , which interfere destructively.,width=453,height=151 ]    [ fig1 ]    the @xmath5 transition of dis is but the simplest example of a whole variety of processes involving the breakup of a parton @xmath6 to its two  body fock  space components @xmath4 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the situation where the @xmath4 transition proceeds coherently over the whole nucleus . in dis",
    "this means , for example , @xmath7 .",
    "we can then make use of the fact , that the highly energetic partons move along straight  line trajectories and their impact parameters @xmath8 are conserved during the interaction .",
    "when calculating the cross section , we can substitute the conjugated @xmath9matrix of a parton by the @xmath9matrix of an antiparton ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "then , all we need are the @xmath9matrices for the forward scattering of fictitious multi  parton systems off the nuclear target .",
    "they have been obtained for all cases of interest : @xmath5 @xcite , which is of relevance for dis and dijets / single jets in the current fragmentation region , @xmath10 @xcite , relevant for the production of ( di-)jets in @xmath11collisions at forward rapidities , @xmath12 @xcite , relevant for midrapidities , and @xmath13 @xcite , for the production of heavy quarks .",
    "the master formula for the dijet spectrum reads @xcite : @xmath14   \\nonumber \\\\ \\times & & \\psi_{a \\to bc}(z_b , { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_b - { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_c )   \\psi_{a \\to bc}^*(z_b,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}'_b - { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}'_c )   \\nonumber \\\\ \\times & & \\big\\ {   s^{(4)}_{\\bar{b}\\bar{c}cb}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}'_b,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}'_c,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_b,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_c ) + s^{(2)}_{\\bar{a}a}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}'_a,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_a ) -s^{(3)}_{\\bar{b}\\bar{c}a}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_a,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}'_b,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}'_c ) -s^{(3)}_{\\bar{a}bc}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}'_a,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_b,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_c ) \\big\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{master_eq } \\ ] ] here @xmath15 is the light cone wave function for the transition @xmath4 , spin / flavor etc .",
    "labels are suppressed . the fraction of @xmath6 s light  cone momentum carried by @xmath16 is @xmath17 , and the transverse momenta of partons",
    "@xmath18 are @xmath19 .",
    "the multiparton @xmath9matrices can be evaluated using the glauber ",
    "gribov theory , for example the four  parton @xmath9matrix will have the form @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is a collective label for impact parameters , @xmath22 is the color dipole ( cd ) cross section operator for the interaction of the @xmath23 system with the free nucleon target .",
    "it is an operator in the space of possible color  singlet states @xmath24 .",
    "the momentum space formulation gives rise to the nonlinear @xmath0 factorisation @xcite , for short reviews , see @xcite .    to calculate the topological cross sections",
    ", we have to insert into eq .",
    "( 1 ) the multiparton @xmath9matrices with a definite number of cut pomerons .",
    "to this end , we decompose the free  nucleon cd operator @xmath25 into an ` elastic ' part @xmath26 , which contains the contribution of color singlet exchange with a nucleon ( the _ uncut _ pomeron ) , and an ` excitation ' part @xmath27 , which represents the ( square of ) color  octet single gluon exchange with a nucleon ( the _ cut _ pomeron ) .",
    "then , an expansion of the nuclear @xmath9matrix in terms of @xmath28 is precisely the sought  for expansion in terms of cut pomerons .",
    "an expansion in terms of @xmath26 would give rise to an expansion in terms of uncut pomerons  the sign alternating multipomeron absorptive corrections .",
    "it is important to realize , that the cut and uncut pomeron parts of @xmath29 separately are infrared sensitive , and depend on a nonperturbative parameter , the cd cross section for large dipoles @xmath30 .",
    "an important aspect of the color coupled  channel scattering is the emergence of _ two types of cut pomerons_. indeed one has to distinguish between the gluon exchanges which induce transitions between different color multiplets @xmath31 of the @xmath32system , and such color octet exchanges which only rotate the @xmath32 system within the same multiplet .",
    "as we lack the space , we skip here the discussion of topological cross sections for dijet observables , which follow from evaluating eq.([master_eq ] ) . instead , we present results for fully inclusive topological cross sections in dis , which illustrate the importance of a correct treatment of the color  coupled channel aspects .",
    "following early works on hadron ",
    "nucleus scattering @xcite , the profile function for the inelastic @xmath33-dipole - nucleus interaction could be expanded in manifestly positive terms : @xmath34   = \\exp[-\\sigma({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) t({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}})]\\sum_k { 1 \\over k ! } [ \\sigma({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) t({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}})]^k   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then one would interpret @xmath35 as the profile function for the @xmath36cut pomeron topological cross section , we call it the ` glauber ",
    "agk ' prediction .",
    "it is too good to be true  a prediction of topological cross sections without any soft parameter , given solely in terms of the cd cross section ! recall that the decomposition into cut and uncut pomerons was infrared sensitive , and indeed this shows up in the explicit dependence of our result @xcite on @xmath30 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 \\nu_a^k / k!$ ] .",
    "the dramatic difference between the single ",
    "channel glauber ",
    "agk result and the novel qcd cutting rules is shown in fig.(2 ) , where we plot the profile function for @xmath36 cut pomerons as a function of impact parameter for a fairly large dipole of @xmath40 fm , with a cd cros section from @xcite . while multiple cuts are nonnegligible also for the glauber ",
    "agk result , it suggests a strong hierachy of topological cross sections .",
    "this is not at all borne out by our qcd cutting rules . in fig.(3 ) we show the @xmath36cut pomeron contribution to the structure function @xmath41 on a heavy nucleus as a function of impact parameter .",
    "the drastic difference to glauber  agk of our result is an interesting prediction for a possible future electron  ion collider @xcite",
