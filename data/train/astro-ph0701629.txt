    "one of the key objectives of the planned , low - frequency gravitational - wave ( gw ) detector lisa ( laser interferometric space antenna ) is the detection of supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binary mergers at cosmological distances .",
    "the observation of these chirping gw sources would deepen our understanding of ( i ) general relativity , e.g. by offering unique tests of spacetime physics in the vicinity of smbhs @xcite , ( ii ) cosmology , by providing additional constraints on the luminosity distance ",
    "redshift relation @xcite , ( iii ) large - scale structure , by indirectly constraining hierarchical structure formation scenarios @xcite , and ( iv ) black hole astrophysics , e.g. by allowing accurate determinations of eddington ratios , and other attributes of black hole accretion , in systems with smbh mass and spin known independently , from the gw measurements @xcite .    from a purely astronomical point of view ,",
    "one of the most attractive features of the lisa mission design is the possibility to constrain the 3-dimensional location ( i.e. sky position and distance ) of gw inspiral sources to within a small enough volume that the identification of potential electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts to smbh merger events can be contemplated seriously .",
    "indeed , the accuracy of such lisa localizations at merger are encouraging , with an error volume @xmath4 for smbh masses @xmath5 at @xmath6 , for instance @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that this accuracy may be sufficient to allow an unique identification of the bright quasar activity that may be associated with any such smbh merger .",
    "another possibility , examined here in detail , is to monitor the sky for em counterparts in real time , as the smbh inspiral proceeds .",
    "this is arguably one of the most efficient ways to identify reliably ( prompt ) em counterparts to smbh merger events , since the exact nature of such counterparts is a priori unknown . using the gw inspiral signal accumulated up to some look",
    " back time , @xmath7 , preceding the final coalescence , one already has a partial knowledge of where the source of gws is located on the sky .",
    "since the sky position is deduced primarily from the detector s motion around the sun , one anticipates that angular positioning uncertainties will not change too dramatically during the last few days before merger , so that a targeted em observation of the final stages of inspiral may be a feasible task . here",
    ", we present an in - depth study of the potential for such pre - merger localizations with lisa , while we discuss various astrophysical concepts and observational strategies for em counterpart identifications in a companion work @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present analysis is thus to determine the accuracy of smbh inspiral localizations with lisa , as a function of look  back time , @xmath7 , prior to merger .",
    "the lisa detector is not uniformly sensitive to sources with different sky positions and angular momentum orientations .",
    "results will thus generally depend on the fiducial values of these angles .",
    "our first objective is to calculate the time - dependence of distributions of localization errors , for randomly oriented sources , over a large range of values for the smbh masses and source redshift .",
    "a second objective of our analysis is to estimate source parameter dependencies for these distributions of localization errors , i.e. how the 3-dimensional ( sky position and distance ) localization error distributions depend on the fiducial sky position of gw sources .",
    "this is useful to understand which regions of the sky may be best suited for the identification of em counterparts to smbh merger events . to the best of our knowledge , this angle dependence has not been explored in detail before , not even in terms of final errors at isco ( i.e. at @xmath8 , when using the complete inspiral data - stream , up to the innermost stable circular orbit , or isco ) .",
    "parameter estimation uncertainties for lisa inspirals have been considered previously , under a variety of approximations @xcite .",
    "these studies differ in the levels of approximation adopted for the gw waveform , using various orders of the post - newtonian expansion",
    ". the lisa signal output for these waveforms are obtained through a linear combination of the two gw polarizations , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with the beam pattern functions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the beam patterns define the detector sensitivity for the two polarizations .",
    "they are determined by the angles describing the instantaneous orientation of the lisa constellation relative to the gw polarizations .",
    "as the lisa detector constellation orbits the sun , with a one year period , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are slowly changing in time and this introduces an additional time dependence in the lisa signal . as first shown by cutler  @xcite , the source sky position can be determined with lisa using this modulation . in the formalism given by cutler  @xcite , this modulation couples time and angular dependencies in a complicated way , making the estimation of localization errors numerically costly for a large set of smbh binary random orientations and parameters .    using a different approach",
    ", cornish & rubbo @xcite have derived the orbital modulation in a much simpler form , in which the angular parameter dependence and the time dependence can be decoupled . here , starting directly from the original cutler  @xcite expression , we give an independent derivation of the cornish & rubbo @xcite formula and write it in an equivalent form , from which decoupling is more evident .",
    "we do this by expanding the lisa response function into a discrete fourier sum of harmonics of the fundamental frequency of lisa s orbital motion , @xmath13 .",
    "since lisa s orbit does not include high frequency features , we expect this sum to be quickly convergent .",
    "in fact , it is clear from the cornish & rubbo @xcite result that the expansion terminates at @xmath14 and that there are no higher order harmonics due to the detector s motion .",
    "the series coefficients in the expansion are independent of time and only depend on the relative angles at isco .",
    "we then develop a fisher matrix formalism in which parameter error distributions can be mapped independently of time , while the time dependence can be computed independently of the specific smbh binary orbital elements .",
    "a monte carlo simulation for random binary orientations then becomes a simple linear combination , without any integral evaluations .",
    "this greatly reduces the numerical cost of estimating parameter uncertainty distributions , even at fixed observation time ( e.g. to map distributions of errors at isco ) .",
    "we use this numerical cost advantage    1 .   to map the distribution of localization errors for the full three dimensional grid of smbh total mass ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) , redshift ( @xmath17@xmath18 ) and arbitrary",
    "look  back time ( @xmath7 ) before merger , 2 .   to study how source localization error distributions vary systematically with sky position , and 3 .   to discuss implications , in terms of advance warning times , for prompt electromagnetic counterpart searches with large field - of - view astronomical instruments .",
    "we call this new approach the harmonic mode decomposition ( hmd )",
    ". the method verifies that the amplitude modulation , which is restricted to frequencies less than @xmath19 , is indeed a very slow modulation when compared to the gw frequency of lisa smbh inspirals ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) .",
    "one plausibly expects that physical parameters which determine the amplitude modulation ( like the source sky position and orbital inclination relative to the detector ) can be estimated independently of the parameters which determine the gw frequency ( like masses , orbital phase , time to isco ) . in the hmd method ,",
    "the two sets of parameters are naturally separated and can be estimated independently .",
    "in particular , parameters related to the modulation can essentially be determined on a background of gw - cycle averaged signal . in the present work ,",
    "we compute lisa inspiral localization errors with the approximation that high frequency signal parameters have strictly no cross - correlations with parameters related to the slow orbital modulation .",
    "in addition to the numerical advantages mentioned above , the hmd formalism offers a clear interpretation of the time evolution of uncertainties for the slow modulation parameters .",
    "this can be used to gain a better understanding of the general evolutionary properties of localization errors .",
    "the following questions , that we address in detail in our work , are particularly relevant .    1 .   under what conditions",
    "do the localization uncertainties scale simply with the measured signal  to  noise ratio , and how do these uncertainties evolve during the final stages of inspiral ? 2 .   to what extent",
    "do the high and low frequency signal parameters decouple ?",
    "what are the best determined combinations of the angular parameters ? 4 .",
    "how and why does the shape of the 3d localization error ellipsoid change during the final week(s ) of observation ?    in our analysis , we neglect the `` doppler phase '' due to lisa s orbital motion , smbh spin precession effects and any finite smbh binary orbital eccentricities .",
    "these approximations are advantageous for the resulting simplicity , but the use of the hmd method is not restricted to these approximations .",
    "we also outline a generalized hmd method which remains numerically much more efficient than standard methods .",
    "we leave a numerical implementation of this general hmd method to future work",
    ". it will be particularly interesting to determine how our approximate results for the evolution of lisa localization errors are modified when spin precession effects are included , since spin precession effects were shown to improve the final localization errors by factors of @xmath22@xmath23 at isco @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s : conventions ] we define our conventions and the assumptions made in our analysis . in   [ s : hmd ] we expand the lisa gw signal in fourier modes and obtain the conversion from actual physical parameters to corresponding fourier amplitudes . in   [ s : hmdfisher ] , we incorporate these results into a fisher matrix formalism and derive the expressions necessary to estimate correlation errors for hmd signals . in   [ s : advantages : computation_times ] , we quantify the computational advantages of the hmd method . in   [ s : results ] , we present results from monte carlo computations of the time evolution of localization errors and discuss results in terms of advance warning times for prompt electromagnetic counterpart searches . in ",
    "[ s : discussion ] , we develop toy models to interpret the time - dependence of lisa localization errors and to answer questions ( i)(iv ) above .",
    "we summarize our results and conclude in ",
    "[ s : conclusions ] .",
    "this section is divided into three parts .",
    "first , we list the definitions of physical quantities used in this paper , in particular the variables describing a smbh inspiral .",
    "second , we give the equations which determine the lisa inspiral signal .",
    "third , we state all the assumptions made in this work .      in general ,",
    "an smbh inspiral is described by a total of 17 parameters .",
    "these include 2 redshifted mass parameters , @xmath24 , 6 parameters related to the bh spin vectors , @xmath25 , the orbital eccentricity , @xmath26 , the source luminosity distance , @xmath27 , 2 angles locating the source in the sky , @xmath28 , 2 angles that describe the relative orientation of the binary orbit , @xmath29 , a reference time , @xmath30 , and a reference phase at isco , @xmath31 , and the orbital phase , @xmath32 . throughout this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to circular orbits by omitting the orbital eccentricity , @xmath26 , and instead of the orbital phase , @xmath32 , we use the look ",
    "back time before merger , @xmath33 , as our evolutionary time parameter .",
    "the lisa signal for a gw inspiral is determined by the above set of parameters and two additional angular parameters describing the orientation of lisa , @xmath34 .",
    "we elaborate on the definitions of our mass and angular parameters below .      for component masses",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 , the total mass is @xmath37 , the reduced mass is @xmath38 , the symmetric mass ratio is @xmath39 and the chirp mass is defined as @xmath40 @xcite . throughout this work , we use geometrical units : @xmath41 . in this case , the mass can be expressed in units of time : @xmath42 .",
    "the measured gw waveforms are insensitive to the cosmological parameters , if they are expressed in terms of the luminosity distance and the redshifted mass parameters , e.g. @xmath43 ( same for redshifted chirp and reduced masses ) .",
    "we write a generic look ",
    "back time ( or `` observation time '' ) before merger as @xmath33 , and a generic redshifted gw frequency ( or `` observation frequency '' ) as @xmath44 index for @xmath44 and @xmath33 because we never consider comoving frequencies or times . ] .",
    "we use the leading order ( i.e. newtonian ) approximation for the frequency evolution .",
    "therefore , the observed frequency at look  back time @xmath33 before merger is ( e.g. eq . 3.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath45 or equivalently @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the redshifted total mass in units of @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the symmetric mass ratio ( @xmath50 for equal component masses , ",
    "[ s : conventions : assumptions ] ) , @xmath51 is the inverse light - travel time across the radius of the lisa orbit , and the null index stands for the order of approximation .",
    "the inspiral phase extends until the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , at @xmath52 , is reached @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ( observer - frame ) look  back time before merger corresponding to the isco , and @xmath55 is the ( observer - frame ) frequency at isco .    in the present work",
    ", we fix the start of the observation ( i.e. when the source first enters lisa s frequency band ) at look  back time @xmath56 , and examine how the value of an end - of - observation time , @xmath7 , prior to merger affects the precision on source localization .",
    "we restrict ourselves to pre - isco inspiral signals , corresponding to @xmath57 .",
    "note that any instantaneous look  back time @xmath33 associated with an observation lasting from look  back times @xmath56 to @xmath7 must obey @xmath58 in our notation .",
    "lisa is an equilateral triangle - shaped interferometer with an arm - length of @xmath59 km , orbiting around the sun .",
    "the constellation trails @xmath60 behind the earth and is tilted @xmath61 relative to the ecliptic .",
    "the detector plane precesses around the orbital axis with the same one - year period as the orbital period @xcite .",
    "following closely refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , including in notation , we define two coordinate systems .",
    "the barycentric frame is tied to the ecliptic , with @xmath62 lying in the ecliptic plane and @xmath63 normal to it .",
    "the detector reference frame tied to the detector , with @xmath64 normal to the detector plane , while @xmath65 are in the plane and co - rotating with the detector so that the arms are described by time - independent vectors .",
    "we refer to the barycentric frame with normal coordinates and to the detector frame with primed coordinates .",
    "the unit vectors defining the source location on the sky , @xmath66 , and the smbh binary orbital angular momentum , @xmath67 , are described by polar angles @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the ecliptic frame , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the detector frame : @xmath72 since we assume no smbh spins , orbital angular momentum is conserved and the @xmath73 coordinates are time - independent properties of the sources .",
    "let @xmath34 be the two angles specifying the orientation of the lisa system in the ecliptic : @xmath74 describes its orbital phase during its motion around the sun , while @xmath75 describes the rotation of the triangle around its geometrical center .",
    "if their values at merger are written @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then at an arbitrary look  back time @xmath33 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the orbital angular velocity around the sun .",
    "the time dependence of the detector normal vector @xmath80 can be expressed as @xmath81 the detector angles are given by @xmath82.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us also define @xmath83 , the _ polarization angle _ of the gw waveform , as @xcite @xmath84    note that there are only 6 independent angular parameters @xmath85 .",
    "other detector specific quantities like @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath83 can be expressed in terms of these 6 independent parameters using eqs .",
    "( [ e : angles_first][e : angles_last ] ) .",
    "let us introduce a new set of 6 independent angles , @xmath90 with the following definitions :    * @xmath91 is the relative latitude of @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( i.e. the inclination of the binary orbit to the line of sight ) , * @xmath94 is the relative longitude of @xmath92 and @xmath95 , * @xmath96 , * @xmath97 .",
    "the explicit definitions are given in appendix  [ app : angles ] .",
    "let us refer to the angles at the reference time @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "although @xmath100 and @xmath101 are time - dependent , as given by ( [ e : xi(t)],[e : phi(t ) ] ) @xmath102 is a time - independent combination , unlike the time - dependent @xmath103 .",
    "the angles at @xmath104 are thus given by @xmath105 .",
    "these angles have the interesting property that they possess isotropic _ a priori _ distributions , like the original @xmath99 variables , but the measured gw waveforms expressed in terms of these new variables are much simpler than when they are expressed in terms of the original set eqs .",
    "( [ e : angles_first][e : angles_last ] ) .",
    "two additional quantities which are useful to describe the sensitivity of the detector in various directions are the antenna beam patterns @xcite : @xmath106 where the sign @xmath107 is defined to be positive for @xmath12 , and negative for @xmath11 .",
    "equation  ( [ e : fx+ ] ) and the transformation rules eqs .",
    "( [ e : angles_first][e : angles_last ] ) define the time evolution of the antenna beam patterns for a given set of final angles @xmath99 as the lisa system orbits around the sun .",
    "note that the lisa system is equivalent to two independent orthogonal - arm interferometers which are rotated by @xmath108 relative to each other @xcite .",
    "both data - streams are given by the same equations ( see eq . [ [ e : h_i , iidef ] ] below ) , modulo a change of one of the angles for the second detector : @xmath109 ( or equivalently @xmath110 using our time - independent angular variables ) .",
    "thanks to this simple relationship between the two data - streams , it is possible to carry out all the calculations for the first data - stream , and later include the second data - stream in the final expression by varying the fiducial angle @xmath102 .",
    "we group the most important parameters describing the inspiral as follows : @xmath111 this organization of parameters has fundamental importance in our formalism . as we show in   [",
    "s : waveform ] , the parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 relate to the high frequency gw signal , while the parameters @xmath114 relate to the distinctly slow orbital modulation .      for a circular binary inspiral ,",
    "the two polarizations of gw signal are well approximated by the restricted post - newtonian expressions @xmath115 the gw phase @xmath116 , which is twice the orbital phase , @xmath117 , can be expanded into the series @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the leading order newtonian solution to the phase evolution , successive terms correspond to small general relativistic corrections , @xmath31 is the reference phase at isco and @xmath120 for all @xmath121 .",
    "the instantaneous gw frequency is defined as the time derivative of the gw phase ( [ e : pnexpansion ] ) , i.e. @xmath122 , which changes very slowly compared to the gw phase itself , @xmath123 . in practice we use the newtonian approximation ( [ e : f0(t ) ] ) , @xmath124 .",
    "note that equation ( [ e : pnexpansion ] ) depends implicitly on the reference time , @xmath125 , since our time variable @xmath33 is the look ",
    "back time before @xmath125 ( see   [ s : definitions : time ] )    the signal measured by lisa is a linear combination of the two polarizations ( [ e : h_+x ] ) , weighted by the antenna beam patterns @xmath126 and @xmath127 for each of the two equivalent interferometers , defined by ( [ e : fx+ ] ) , resulting in the two observable data ",
    "streams @xmath128,\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath129 comes from the opening angle of the lisa arms .",
    "the beam patterns are determined by the relative orientation of the source polarizations and the detector .",
    "their time - dependence is due to the following three main effects : lisa changes its orientation as it orbits the sun , lisa changes its relative distance to the source as it orbits the sun , and the orbital plane of the smbh binary can precess because of spin - orbit coupling effects . substituting ( [ e : h_+x ] ) in ( [ e : h_i , iidef ] ) and expressing it in complex form , we get @xmath130 where @xmath131 defines the overall amplitude scale , with @xmath132 the @xmath133 factor defines the angular dependence of the signal , @xmath134 where @xmath135 , the _ amplitude modulation _ , captures the varying detector sensitivity with direction and polarizations of the gws , @xmath136 the additional @xmath137 modulation is the _ doppler phase modulation _ , which is the difference between the phase of the wavefront at the detector and at the barycenter @xcite : @xmath138 there is a non - negligible number of doppler phase cycles only for a gw frequency satisfying @xmath139 ( see definition of @xmath140 below eq .  [ [ e : t0(f ) ] ] above ) .",
    "however , equation  ( [ e : fisco ] ) shows that @xmath141 , hence the @xmath142 frequency is reached only after isco for typical smbh component masses of @xmath5 and redshift @xmath6 . even for smaller @xmath143 component masses ,",
    "the total number of cycles , @xmath144 , remains @xmath145 until the final @xmath146 of inspiral .",
    "therefore the doppler phase ( [ e : doppler_phase ] ) is practically negligible for smbh inspirals .",
    "in fact , estimating localization errors without accounting for the doppler phase affects results by less than a factor of @xmath147 ( for @xmath5 at @xmath6 ; s. a. hughes , private communication ) . therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ e : g ] ) , we neglect @xmath137 and restrict ourselves to the approximation @xmath148 the explicit frequency - dependence dropped out , and the time evolution of the signal @xmath149 is now fully determined by the time evolution of the angles @xmath150 .",
    "note that the amplitude modulation ( [ e : amplitude_mod ] ) , @xmath151 , is traditionally expressed in complex polar notation ( e.g. @xcite ) , where the magnitude and argument of the complex number are called _ polarization amplitude _ and _ phase_. as we will show , the mode decomposition is simplest in the original cartesian complex form ( [ e : amplitude_mod ] ) , which already includes both the polarization amplitude and phase ; thus , we do not distinguish these two quantities in the following .",
    "the function @xmath152 given in ( [ e : g ] ) also accounts for spin - orbit precession if the orbital orientation @xmath153 in @xmath150 is chosen to be time - dependent , to satisfy the equations for spin - orbit precession , and if an extra precession phase shift , @xmath154 , is introduced ( see eq . 2.14 in lang & hughes @xcite ) in addition to the doppler phase in ( [ e : g ] ) .",
    "in our calculations , we neglect spin precession but discuss how the hmd method can be extended to include that effect in ",
    "[ s : hmdfisher : general ] .",
    "finally , we express the measured signal ( [ e : h_i , ii ] ) as @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the _ high frequency carrier signal _ and @xmath157 is the _ slow modulation _ :",
    "@xmath158    equation ( [ e : schematic ] ) shows that the two sets of parameters @xmath114 and @xmath159 are exclusively determined by the low frequency modulation and the high frequency carrier , respectively .",
    "for this reason , we only expect a low level of cross - correlation between these sets of parameters : parameters associated with very different timescale components should essentially decouple . in sec .",
    "[ s : advantages : simple ] and appendix  [ app : simple ] , we consider several toy models which allow us to understand the necessary conditions , and the extent to which , parameters associated with high and low frequency components decorrelate in the course of an extended , continuous observation .      in the present work , we make the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "we assume that the amplitude modulation can be used to determine the luminosity distance and angular parameters , @xmath160 , while the other parameters , @xmath161 , are determined from the high frequency gw phase .",
    "we assume no cross - correlations between these two sets of parameters .",
    "this is supported by the results listed in table  1 of hughes  @xcite , which shows the full covariance matrix of a monte carlo realization of 2pn waveforms .",
    "the correlation coefficients are @xmath162 for the above quantities , and the absolute scale of the second set of parameters is very low in the first place .",
    "berti  et  al .",
    "@xcite also report that the sets @xmath163 and @xmath114 are relatively uncorrelated for general relativity and even for alternative theories of gravity . in the latter case , the carrier @xmath164 in the signal ( [ e : schematic ] )",
    "is modified but not the slow modulation , @xmath165 , so that the general expectation of decoupling is maintained .",

    "the standard approach for estimating parameter errors requires the evaluation of an @xmath393 symmetric fisher matrix , where each matrix element is an integral over the range spanned by the gw frequency during inspiral ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ; and   [ s : hmdfisher ] ) . here , @xmath394 is the number of parameters describing the signal .",
    "the number of independent elements in a symmetric matrix is @xmath395 .",
    "let us assume that the evaluation of a single integral requires to compute the waveform at @xmath396 separate instances .",
    "the computation of one integral is sufficient also to trace the time evolution at @xmath396 different @xmath7 values , if one uses a single trapezoidal integral in frequency from @xmath55 to @xmath397 and stores results at each intermediate value of @xmath44 . since the time evolution of the frequency",

    "to evaluate the evolution of parameter errors as a function of @xmath7 for @xmath399 different instances requires @xmath399 computations .",
    "therefore , the standard method costs @xmath400 computational time units .",
    "in contrast , with our proposed hmd method (   [ s : hmdfisher : approximate ] ) , the @xmath114 parameters are decoupled from the @xmath163 parameters (   [ s : conventions : assumptions ] ) and from time .",

    "since it is symmetric , it has only @xmath405 independent elements , but it turns out that the computation of only @xmath406 elements is sufficient for a single harmonic ( we need only the @xmath406 derivatives of the @xmath407 functions , see eq .  [",

    "dependent gw inspiral signals for lisa .",
    "the method relies on the fact that lisa s orbital motion induces a modulation on timescales that are long relative to the inspiral gw frequency .",
    "since this modulation is periodic , with a fundamental frequency of @xmath550 , it can be expanded in a discrete fourier sum . in the hmd formalism ,",
    "dependencies on sky position , orbital angular momentum orientation , and detector orientation in the lisa signal are inscribed in time - independent coefficients , while time - dependent basis functions are independent of these angles .",
    "this decomposition helps to reduce the computational cost of monte carlo simulations exploring the time - dependence of source localization errors by orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the hmd method can be used in conjunction with plausible approximations to further decrease the computational cost of explorations of the parameter space of localization errors for lisa inspiral events . in our analysis , we identified two different characteristic frequency constituents of the signal : the high frequency restricted post - newtonian gw inspiral waveform and the low frequency amplitude modulation resulting from the detector s orbital motion . in the hmd method , these two components separate and parameters that depend only on the low frequency modulation ( such as the source position and the orbital angular momentum angle ) can be estimated independently of the other source parameters determined by the high frequency carrier signal .",
    "our working assumption was that cross - correlations among these two sets of parameters must be much smaller than parameter correlations within either set .",
    "this hypothesis is valid very generally in the no spin limit for smbhs , as shown by full fisher matrix calculations without such approximations for general relativity @xcite and alternative theories of gravity @xcite .    in order to further examine the validity of our assumptions and the ultimate boundaries of our models , and to understand our results ,",
    "we have constructed illustrative toy models that we now describe in some detail .",
    "these toy models show that the separation of parameters into various subsets associated with different characteristic frequencies of the signal is a rather general property , which turns out to be an efficient way of reducing the computational cost of error estimations for the lisa problem .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss very simple toy models which capture the essence of the problem posed by the time - evolution of parameter error estimations .",
    "we then use these models to answer general questions on the lisa - specific parameter estimation problem .",
    "our harmonic decomposition technique is based on the simple intuition that the angular information can be deduced from the slow periodic modulation of the high frequency gw waveform . in   [ s : hmd ] , we have shown that modulation harmonics with frequencies larger than @xmath14 vanish exactly . here",
    ", we discuss the general properties of such a modulation . in the case of lisa",
    ", the high frequency carrier signal has an effective , cycle - averaged signal - to - noise ratio which monotonically increases with time as smbh binaries approach merger . to mimic such events , we also assume in all of our toy models that the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio continuously improves throughout the observation .",
    "we seek answers to the following questions :    1 .",
    "how do mean errors evolve during the final days of observation ?",
    "+ on the one hand , in standard angle - averaged treatments ( e.g. @xcite ) , an evolution of errors with the inverse of the signal - to - noise ratio is generally assumed . this would suggest a large improvement during the last day of inspiral . on the other hand , the slow modulation picture suggests just the contrary :",
    "not much improvement is expected at late times when there is effectively very little modulation ( finn & larson 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "does the introduction of additional high frequency components in the signal have any effect on the estimations of low frequency parameters ?",
    "+ in the gw context , it is of general interest to determine under what circumstances additional high frequency signal components , such as higher order post - newtonian corrections or spin - induced effects , remain decoupled from the determination of angular and distance information based on the signal amplitude modulation .",
    "3 .   are there combinations of signal parameters for which errors improve rapidly in the last days of observation ?",
    "if so , what are these combinations ?",
    "what determines how many such rapidly  improving combinations there will be ?",
    "+ if the distance @xmath27 correlates with the angles , then in principle the volume of the 3d error box can be much smaller than the product of the marginalized errors @xmath551 would imply . unfortunately , in practice ,",
    "this is unlikely to help to reduce the number of false counterparts , because the @xmath552 error will be dominated by weak lensing @xcite .",
    "how does the width of parameter error distributions evolve with time ?",
    "are the best and worst cases approaching the typical case prior to the final days of observation ?",
    "how do we expect the eccentricity of localization error ellipsoid to evolve with time for lisa ?    here , we restrict our discussion to a brief summary of our findings and direct the reader to appendix  [ app : simple ] for further details on these toy models .",
    "the parameter estimation uncertainties are defined by the correlation error matrix . for @xmath394 parameters , this defines an @xmath394-dimensional error - ellipsoid in the @xmath394-dimensional parameter space , where parameters are constrained at a given confidence level .",
    "marginalized errors for a given parameter are then related to the projection of this ellipsoid on the basis vector corresponding to that parameter .",
    "since the principal axes of this error ellipsoid are generally not aligned with the original parameters , the marginalized errors can be substantial even if the volume of the error ellipsoid is close to zero .",
    "this happens if the ellipsoid is very `` thin '' but has a large size in at least one direction .",
    "diagonal elements of the correlation matrix provide marginalized squared errors on the parameters , while eigenvalues provide squared errors along the principal axes .",
    "we consider three versions of toy signals to understand how a particular harmonic mode contributes to the time - dependence of parameter uncertainties and to find answers to questions 14 above .",
    "we start with the simplest toy model and refine this model by adding more details and complexity in the successive models . in each case , we discuss general implications for the model under consideration .      in our basic toy model , we assume that the true signal is comprised of a constant carrier signal , which is modulated by a single known - frequency cosine , @xmath550 : @xmath553 where @xmath554 and @xmath555 are unknown parameters to be estimated .",
    "we assume that the noise level is rapidly decreasing during the observation , mimicking the gradual increase in the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio for lisa inspiral signals .",
    "the contradictory statements made in relation to question  1 above can be explored with this model .",
    "we find that marginalized parameter errors scale with the signal - to - noise ratio far away from merger ( i.e. @xmath556 ) but they quickly converge to their final values at late times , even though the signal - to - noise ratio keeps accumulating .",
    "it is possible to derive analytical formulae for the evolution of parameter errors to fully characterize this behavior ( see appendix  [ app : simple ] ) .",
    "we find that , even though the error ellipse rapidly decreases in volume , as the inverse of the signal - to - noise ratio near merger , the error ellipse only shrinks along one of its dimensions , the semi - minor axis , so that a non - negligible residual uncertainty remains in the orthogonal subspace ( e.g. along the semi - major axis ) .",
    "this residual uncertainty carries over to final marginalized errors for both parameters .",
    "therefore , this first toy model verifies the second option in relation to question  1 .",
    ": there is no late improvement because there is very little effective signal modulation , making the signal - to - noise argument largely irrelevant .",
    "however , we find below that this model does not carry some essential features of the lisa signal which modify somewhat our final answer to question  1 ( see final toy model below ) .      in our toy second model , we modify the single frequency signal by postulating two pairs of unknown amplitudes and phases for two different _ a priori _ known frequencies , satisfying @xmath557 , which modulate an otherwise constant signal : @xmath558    the number of unknowns in this model is five : @xmath559 and @xmath560 are the coefficients of the functions @xmath561 , @xmath562 , @xmath563 , @xmath564 , and @xmath565 .",
    "again , we assume that the noise decreases quickly with time before merger , at @xmath104 . this model is designed to answer our question  2 above . in this case , we find that parameter errors are correlated only with unique frequency components and the constant signal , all the way to @xmath566 .",
    "the model thus demonstrates how components associated with very different variation timescales can decouple from each other .",
    "moreover , as for the first toy model , we find that marginalized parameter errors effectively stop improving past a finite time before merger ( question  1 ) , which is simply related to their respective frequencies . as a result ,",
    "a nonzero residual error remains again , even though the signal - to - noise ratio continuously increases near merger .",
    "in our final toy model , we insert a few additional features essential to a realistic lisa data - stream .",
    "firstly , we assume 5 low - frequency harmonics , @xmath561 , @xmath562 , @xmath563 , @xmath567 , @xmath568 , with unknown amplitudes .",
    "we also include a high frequency carrier signal with known frequency , @xmath569 , but unknown amplitudes in @xmath570 and @xmath565 , for a total of seven free parameters .",
    "secondly , we note that the lisa system is equivalent to two orthogonal arm interferometers with both detectors measuring polarization phases simultaneously ( which correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude modulation ,   [ s : hmdfisher ] ) .",
    "therefore , the signal is comprised of 4 simultaneous data - streams .",
    "we incorporate this feature by assuming 4 measurements ( i.e. 4 corresponding fisher matrices ) of the signal with 4 given phase shifts ( @xmath571 ; @xmath572 ) so that @xmath573    in this case , we find that 4 principal components improve quickly at late times . as in our second toy model ,",
    "the high frequency parameters decouple from the slow frequency ones , except at very late times when @xmath574 .",
    "this final toy model allows us to answers all of questions  1 - 4 as follows .",
    "* answer  1 : four out of 5 slow principal components of the error ellipsoid are quickly improving with time , while one of them stops improving at @xmath575 .",
    "therefore , any parameter with a large projection along this one poor principal component will stop improving , while parameters nearly orthogonal to it will keep improving quickly .",
    "thus , both statements made in relation to question  1 above can in fact be correct , depending on the connection between a given parameter and the poor principal component .",
    "typically , we expect marginalized parameter uncertainties to evolve as @xmath173 for @xmath576 . for smaller @xmath7 values ,",
    "closer to merger , they would continue to improve , albeit with a shallower slope .",
    "* answer  2 : we find that the introduction of additional high frequency components does not change the evolution of original parameter estimations as long as the time - to - merger is larger than a fraction of the time period of the additional high frequency components .",
    "* answer  3 : as the signal - to - noise ratio increases quickly at late times , rapidly evolving parameter error combinations are given by the principal components of the error ellipsoid corresponding to the final situation at merger .",
    "with 4 data - streams , there are 4 such best principal components .",
    "analogously , for the lisa amplitude modulation given by eq .",
    "( [ e : amplitude_mod ] ) , we expect that the 2 polarization phases for the 2 beam patterns at isco can be best determined : @xmath577 and @xmath578 .",
    "( in terms of ecliptic angular variables , these are the real and imaginary parts of the combination given by eq .",
    "( [ e : hmod ] ) . )",
    "* answer  4 : the widths of error distributions for slow parameters do not change significantly as long as @xmath579 . during this final stretch of time before merger , however , one of the principal components stops improving and the major axis of the error ellipsoid freezes .",
    "since the physical parameters can be considered to be randomly oriented with respect to the ellipsoid axes , distributions of marginalized errors suddenly start broadening for @xmath575 , with a worst case relative orientation leading to very little improvement and a best case relative orientation corresponding to a scaling with @xmath173 .",
    "these simple toy models offer a general interpretation of the time dependence of lisa s parameter estimation errors for source localization .",
    "the lisa data stream is described by @xmath418 physical parameters , @xmath114 , which are not the harmonic coefficients themselves but determine these coefficients , @xmath407 ( or conversely , the mode expansion coefficients @xmath407 determine the physical parameters @xmath114 ; see   [ s : hmd ] ) . neglecting doppler phase and spin precession effects ,",
    "@xmath580 modes determine the signal by eqs .",
    "( [ e : hmodres],[e : g_jres ] ) . in principle",
    ", any @xmath418 of the @xmath407 mode amplitudes uniquely determine the physical parameters , @xmath114 .",
    "however , in the presence of noise , each of these modes are uncertain and the combination of all modes helps in reducing the estimation errors of the @xmath114 variables .",
    "the key implication of our toy models for lisa is that the estimation of low frequency @xmath407 modes with low @xmath302 are effectively decoupled from the high frequency signal , unless the merger is within @xmath162 times the cycle time of the fast - oscillating signal .",
    "we have shown that the hmd of the orbital modulation consists purely of low - order harmonics , with @xmath581 . in comparison ,",
    "the high frequency gw phase has a much higher frequency , corresponding to @xmath582 , and this high frequency signal s cycle time is greater than the time to merger throughout @xmath583 .",
    "hence , physical parameters @xmath114 will remain decoupled from parameters @xmath163 , all the way to isco .",
    "this finding is independent of details of the waveform and the modulation , in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite which show that decoupling occurs independently of the details of the @xmath164 signals , including the modified inspiral waveforms of alternative theories of gravity . in terms of post - newtonian expansions ,",
    "only terms above second order have cycle times as large as the cycle time of the amplitude modulation .",
    "these terms are responsible for the small cross - correlations of the two sets of parameters found by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have not considered spin precession effects , but vecchio  @xcite and lang  &  hughes  @xcite find that spin precession effects can help improve the final localization errors by a factor of @xmath584 .",
    "spin precession cycle times decrease continuously , become of order a few days or less during the last week prior to merger , and of order hours during the last day of inspiral .",
    "therefore , according to our simple models , we expect spin precession effects to improve the source parameter estimation errors especially during the final two weeks before isco . during that period of time , in the absence of spin effects ,",
    "parameter uncertainties ( especially the sky position major axis and the luminosity distance ) cease to improve when using only the amplitude modulation .",
    "the best - determined parameters at isco are , approximately , the independent detector outputs at isco , i.e. the real and imaginary parts of @xmath585 : @xmath586 and @xmath587 ( see appendix  [ app : simple : best ] ) .",
    "these are the 4 independent combinations of 5 physical parameters @xmath588 which correspond to the eigenvectors of the error covariance matrix following the steep evolution @xmath589 all the way to isco .",
    "we refer to the fifth independent combination , which is orthogonal to these best eigenvectors , the `` worst '' eigenvector , since for this combination , the evolution ceases to improve as @xmath173 within @xmath590 of merger .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain this worst combination explicitly by using the 4 other eigenvectors and gram - schmidt orthogonalization ( but we have not done this in practice ) . since the highest frequency harmonic of the slow modulation is for @xmath305 , the corresponding cycle time is @xmath591 .",
    "thus , we expect errors will stop improving roughly @xmath561@xmath515 weeks prior to merger",
    ". distributions of errors will quickly broaden during these final stages of observation before isco . simply scaling errors with @xmath173 , as in the angle - averaged formalism ( e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "is acceptable if one studies the evolution of parameter errors at @xmath592 weeks , or if one only focuses on the best case parameter combinations . in general",
    ", the exponent in the @xmath593 scaling decreases as one approaches merger time depending on how close the particular combination of angles considered is to the worst combination .",
    "our findings for the eccentricity evolution of lisa s sky localization error ellipsoid can also be understood with the simple toy models .",
    "in fact , we found this behavior to be expected for any model signal with relative instantaneous signal amplitude increasing quickly with time , e.g. @xmath594 , @xmath595 . in this case , the principal axes of the general parameter error ellipsoid separate near @xmath596 .",
    "there are a limited number of principal errors which rapidly decrease to zero near @xmath596 , while others `` freeze out '' at a time related to a fraction of the cycle time of the particular waveform ( @xmath597 if @xmath598 ) . for lisa",
    ", there are 5 variable parameters , @xmath599 , and estimation uncertainties of 4 combinations of these parameters , @xmath600 , improve quickly with @xmath173 .",
    "these combinations correspond to the best 4 principal axes of the 5-dimensional error ellipsoid .",
    "the remaining @xmath601 principal axis does not improve as @xmath173 , but rather stops improving at a fraction of the last modulation cycle time .",
    "the two dimensional sky position error ellipsoid is the projection of the general 5-dimensional error ellipsoid on the @xmath68 plane .",
    "this plane will generally not be aligned with the principal axes of the 5-dimensional ellipsoid . in a typical case , therefore , there will be a nonzero projection on the worst principal component and the sky position ellipsoid will stop shrinking along the worst principal component . this explains why the major axis , @xmath472 , ceases to improve and the eccentricity increases close to merger .",
    "according to this argument , it is somewhat surprising to find that the minor axis , @xmath473 , can stop improving much before isco .",
    "figure  [ f : errortau ] shows that this happens in the worst @xmath486 of all cases for randomly chosen source angular parameters .",
    "the reason for this is that , in some cases , not all rapidly improving `` best '' principal components have a small absolute error at isco .",
    "for example , consider an edge - on binary inspiral ( @xmath602 ) .",
    "since two of the quickly improving parameters are simply proportional to @xmath603 , the errors will be very large for these parameters .",
    "thus , depending on the relative orientation of the detector and the source at isco , there can be large absolute errors in some cases even for the best combinations of parameters .",
    "in short , both axes of the sky position error ellipsoid can stop improving at late times in those cases when lisa is oriented in its least favorable direction at isco .",
    "we have developed a new harmonic mode decomposition ( hmd ) method to study the feasibility of using lisa inspiral signals to locate coalescing smbh binaries in the sky , as the mergers proceed . according to our extensive hmd survey of potential lisa sources",
    ", it will be possible to trigger large field - of - view searches for prompt electromagnetic counterparts during the final stages of inspiral and coalescence .",
    "our results indicate , for instance , that for a typical @xmath604 merger event with total mass @xmath605 , a 10-day advance notice will be available to localize the source to within a @xmath606 region of the sky .",

    "for @xmath671 , we find that errors increase more abruptly at @xmath672 , which is consistent with the signal - to - noise ratio being a steeper function of time . on the other hand , for lower @xmath102 values ,",
    "parameter estimation errors become more and more sensitive to very early times , @xmath670 . in this case , the marginalized parameter estimation errors are again very slowly changing for @xmath673 , but the approximate time @xmath625 at which parameter errors stop decreasing will be primarily determined by @xmath56 , rather than by the cycle period @xmath626 .",

    "the reason is that , for small @xmath33 , with a noise level decreasing quickly , the corresponding function @xmath711 is linearly independent of , and thus uncorrelated with , the functions @xmath554 and @xmath712 which are both constant to first order .",
    "hence , if there are no more unknowns than @xmath707 , then @xmath554 and @xmath555 are correlated while @xmath685 is decoupled and can be determined independently of the other parameters . however ,",
    "if we add any parameters which are _ not _ constant for @xmath713 , then @xmath685 becomes correlated with those .",

    ", the evolution of estimation errors for low frequency parameters can be obtained with the high frequency modes ( like @xmath686 and @xmath560 ) priored out .",
    "this justifies our simple intuition : once the signal is decomposed into different time - scale components , the parameter estimation problem becomes separable and the evolution of parameter errors corresponding to different such time - scales can be estimated independently from each other .    rather than going through an analytical derivation as in   [ app :",

    "accounting for these high frequency parameters .",
    "we again assume an observation in the look ",

    "th marginalized errors ( top ) and principal errors ( bottom ) are shown for both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) above .",
    "the figures show that , in agreement with our previous model , uncertainties on the low frequency parameters are not affected by the high frequency parameters , except during the final @xmath733 cycle time of the high frequency component , @xmath734 .",
    "the figures also show that the four principal components of the error ellipsoid improve quickly at late times .",
    "marginalized parameter errors improve quickly if they have negligible projection on the bad directions of the error ellipsoid . as a result",
    ", our expectation is that errors will typically not stop improving abruptly , but that there will be a shallower evolution in the final two weeks . in the worst case for a given parameter ,",
    "if it is aligned with the bad ellipsoid principal component , it will stop improving near merger .",
    "in the best case , if the parameter is orthogonal to the bad ellipsoid principal component , it will improve quickly throughout the final days of inspiral .",
    "therefore , we understand that the distribution of errors broadens for @xmath735 .      in the previous section , we have shown that , if the noise decreases quickly like @xmath736 near merger ( at @xmath104 ) , the best - determined parameters are the eigenvectors of the error covariance matrix that improve with @xmath173 . near merger , these are the independent detector outputs at @xmath104 . in the case of lisa inspirals , the observation only extends down to isco . in this case , the best determined combination of physical parameters @xmath588 at isco are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath585 . to prove this",
    ", we have to show that these are uncorrelated and decrease with @xmath173 .",

    "the term in brackets is purely imaginary for the cross correlation of @xmath739 and @xmath740 , hence the real part is always zero .",
    "therefore , the correlation matrix for @xmath745 is diagonal . for diagonal terms , the derivatives are @xmath561 and the integrals become simply @xmath746 , which is exactly @xmath747 .",

    ".    the evolution of an arbitrary combination of angles will be determined by the projection of this combination on the covariance matrix eigenvectors .",
    "a linear combination of good eigenvectors leads to similarly quick improvement of errors with @xmath173 .",
