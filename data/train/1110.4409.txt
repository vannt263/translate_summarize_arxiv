    "the surface electroclinic effect ( sece ) is an experimentally observed phenomenon in the chiral smectic - a ( sm-@xmath0 ) phase whereby a coupling between molecular dipoles and a surface induces local tilt of the director @xmath2 , away from the smectic layer normal @xmath3 at the surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ seceschematic ] .",
    "the sece has been analyzed , both experimentally and theoretically , for materials with a continuous sm-@xmath0 ",
    "sm-@xmath1 transition .",
    "the investigation of w415 was notable in that an unusually large sece was found and the effects of varying the enantiomeric excess were explored .",
    "the sece has not however , been analyzed for materials with first order sm-@xmath0  sm-@xmath1 transitions @xcite .",
    "one motivation for the investigation of the sece in materials with first order sm-@xmath0  sm-@xmath1 transitions is that the strong bulk electroclinic effect ( bece ) of some de vries materials can be attributed to the first order nature of the sm-@xmath0 ",
    "sm-@xmath1 transition @xcite .",
    "the strong bece with its fast analog electrooptic characteristics makes such materials technologically promising .",
    "however , as will be discussed below , the first order nature of the transition may also lead to a strong sece , which has implications for the design of proper surface alignment layers and possibly also for the long - term stability of the alignment in , for instance , ferroelectric liquid crystal display devices based on de vries materials .    experimental and theoretical work on the bece in materials with first order sm-@xmath0  sm-@xmath1 transitions demonstrated the existence of a critical point ( in field ( @xmath4 )  temperature ( @xmath5 ) parameter space ) which terminates a line of first order sm-@xmath1  sm-@xmath1 transitions . for the sece",
    "the analogous parameters would be surface coupling and temperature , although it is not immediately obvious how one can explore such a parameter space experimentally . in sample cells in which one of the two polymer coated glass plates is rubbed to align the director @xmath2 at the surface ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ seceschematic ] ) the sece makes the smectic layer normal @xmath3 deviate by an angle @xmath6 from the rubbing direction , i.e. from @xmath7 .",
    "this angle @xmath6 can be measured using polarized light microscopy .",
    "however , surface pinning prevents the once - formed layer structure from rotating , which means that the surface tilt angle @xmath6 is effectively stuck at the temperature , @xmath8 , where the layers first form in the sm-@xmath0 phase .",
    "thus , for such sample cells one can not explore the variation of the sece with @xmath5 .",
    "we note that @xmath8 could perhaps be varied by quenching the system into the sm-@xmath0 phase at lower temperatures .",
    "another approach would be to establish an alignment direction for @xmath3 without doing so for @xmath2 , i.e. align the smectic layers in a homogeneous bookshelf structure without having a rubbing direction at the surfaces .",
    "this would then allow @xmath2 to rotate , and thus @xmath6 to change , at the surface as temperature is varied .",
    "one way to do this is to shear - align the sample , i.e. to slide the top substrate with respect to the lower substrate under an applied ac field , as was done with the first experiments on surface - stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal cells @xcite .    , away from the smectic layer normal @xmath3 at the surface .",
    "conversely , on rubbed surfaces the sece makes the bulk smectic normal @xmath3 form at an angle to the rubbing direction @xmath7 . ]",
    "the other option is to vary the surface coupling , which increases monotonically with enantiomeric excess @xmath9 .",
    "this should be done by preparing separate cells with varying degrees of @xmath9 .",
    "it could in principle also be achieved via a cell made up of a contact preparation between opposite - handed moleclules of the same compound .",
    "keeping the cell at elevated temperatures ( i.e. , in the isotropic phase ) after filling will facilitate diffusion over the contact boundary until a gradient in @xmath9 develops over a suitable distance in the cell plane . on one side of such a cell @xmath10 and as one moves to the center of the cell ( where there is an equal number of left and right handed molecules , resulting in a racemic mixture ) @xmath11 .",
    "the second half of the cell is the mirror image of the first half , with @xmath12 .",
    "after a long enough time continued diffusion will make the gradient in @xmath9 gradually disappear , but immediately after the first cooling down from the isotropic phase the surface coupling varies continuously across the cell in the @xmath13 direction , where @xmath13 is perpendicular to both @xmath3 and @xmath14 .",
    "provided the gradient in @xmath15 is known we could directly probe the @xmath16 for all values of @xmath9 . in such an experiment , care should be taken to avoid any influence on the structure from the anchoring on the opposing surface . moreover , with time the gradient in @xmath17 on the surface might differ from the one in the bulk , due to surface pinning effects .    as part of the present analysis we obtain a theoretical state map , as shown in fig .",
    "[ statemap](a ) , in enantiomeric excess - temperature space which features a critical point that terminates a line of first order discontinuities in the surface induced tilt .",
    "this critical point ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) is analogous to that found for the phase diagram ( in electric field - @xmath5 space ) for the bece .",
    "we will demonstrate that for sufficiently low temperature @xmath20 , there will be a jump in surface induced tilt as @xmath9 is varied , as shown in fig .",

    "this jump is analogous to the field - induced first order sm-@xmath1 ",

    ", the sece is enhanced due to the first order nature of the zero - field sm-@xmath0  sm-@xmath1 transition @xcite .",
    "however , we will also argue that the sece in de vries type materials is further enhanced due to the minimal layer spacing change at the sm-@xmath0 ",
    "sm-@xmath1 transition .",
    "recent work @xcite , indicates that first order sm-@xmath0  sm-@xmath1 transitions with minimal layer chance are hallmarks of de vries - type materials .",
    "thus , an enhanced sece effect in a material ( such as that described here ) could be a signature of its de vries - like nature .",
    "we also investigate how the surface induced tilt decays as one moves from the surface into the bulk . for materials with continuous sm-@xmath0 ",
    "sm-@xmath1 transitions , such a decay is gentle , meaning that the slope of the decay decreases the further one moves into the bulk .",
    "our analysis shows that for a system with a first order sm-@xmath0 ",
    "sm-@xmath1 transition this will not be the case and that there will be a kink in the decay .",
    "the kink would be a region in which the the slope becomes steeper and the decay becomes much more rapid .",
