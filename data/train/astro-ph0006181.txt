    "faint filaments dominated by balmer line emission are seen around much of the periphery of the cygnus loop supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "these filaments are due to shocks driven by the supernova blastwave into partly neutral material .",
    "the balmer lines , of which h@xmath1 is the strongest , are collisionally excited in a narrow zone behind the shock front ( @xcite ) . in the hot post - shock region , different elements are producing resonance line emission ( mainly in the ultraviolet ) as they move to higher stages of ionization .",
    "the shocked gas has not had time to recombine and cool radiatively and so these shocks are termed `` non - radiative '' .",
    "the balmer lines and the ultraviolet line spectrum can be used as diagnostics to infer properties of the shock wave and conditions in the preshock gas ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    one particular balmer filament ,",
    "the brightest in the northeast region of the cygnus loop , has been the subject of detailed study .",
    "based on the width of the h@xmath1 line , and on line strengths obtained from ground based optical spectra and ultraviolet spectra taken with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) , @xcite inferred a preshock density of @xmath02  @xmath3 and shock velocities of 210  km  s@xmath4 ( for the case of rapid equilibration between ions and electrons ) , and 170  km  s@xmath4 ( for the case of slower coulomb equilibration between ions and electrons ) .",
    "@xcite used the same iue data and optical spectra of a different location along the same filament and favored a 190  km  s@xmath4 shock running into gas with a density of 1  @xmath3 .",
    "the filament was later observed with the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ ( hut ) and",
    "the far ultraviolet line strengths were found to be best fit by a 180  km  s@xmath4 shock , a preshock density of 2  @xmath3 and rapid equilibration of electrons and ions behind the shock ( @xcite ) . however , in the same study , the ratio of line strengths in the o  vi @xmath51032,1038 doublet indicated significant resonant scattering along the line of sight and implied a preshock density between 5  @xmath3 and 12  @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite presented an extensive study of balmer filaments in the ne cygnus loop including new spectra of the filament studied by rbfg ( though with a different slit orientation ) .",
    "they found the width of the broad component of the h@xmath1 line to be significantly narrower than the value given by rbfg ( 130  km  s@xmath4 compared to 167  km  s@xmath4 , fwhm ) . this implied shock velocities of 165  km  s@xmath4 and 130  km  s@xmath4 for the cases of rapid and coulomb equilibration . to reconcile these values with the far ultraviolet lines which required higher shock velocities , both hrb and l92 suggested that the shock may have decelerated rapidly in the last 200 years or so .",
    "the studies discussed above have established the shock properties in a broad sense .",
    "they have shown that the brightest balmer filaments are due to shocks with velocities between 140  km  s@xmath4 and 200  km  s@xmath4 running into gas with a density between about 1  @xmath3 and 10  @xmath3 .",
    "however , refining the limits on the shock velocity and pre - shock density is crucial for interpreting ultraviolet spectra since the strengths of several diagnostic lines change dramatically in this velocity range ( @xcite )",
    ". furthermore , the contradiction in the measured h@xmath1 widths measured by rbfg and hrb has not been resolved , and the recent deceleration history of the shock has not been established .",
    "we take a fresh look at this same balmer filament using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "these observations have the advantage of spatial resolution over the earlier studies .",
    "it has been known from theory ( e.g.  rbfg ) that the balmer emission comes from a very narrow region behind the shock , corresponding to at most a tenth of an arcsecond at the @xmath0  440  pc distance of the cygnus loop ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the earlier observations represent some kind of average over the detailed filament structure .",
    "the results from these observations can be re - examined with a knowledge of the subarcsecond structure of the filament .",
    "more importantly , the spatial information itself contains diagnostics for the shock properties .",
    "for instance , the emissivity of any given line as a function of distance from the shock front depends on the shock velocity and preshock density .",
    "our study consists of a wfpc2 h@xmath1 image and far ultraviolet stis spectra of the filament .",
    "the wfpc2 h@xmath1 image shows the structure of the filament in exquisite detail ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shock wave is an edge - on sheet , gently undulating along the line of sight , with the shock front less than 01 wide when viewed at exact tangency . in this paper",
    "we present the first part of our spectroscopic study using stis - a far ultraviolet long slit spectrum with the slit placed _ perpendicular _ to the shock front .",
    "this orientation minimizes the effects of curvature of the filaments in the plane of the sky and allows us a relatively clean look at the spatial structure of the shock . the second part ( which will be the subject of a future paper ) consists of spectra taken with",
    "the slit oriented _ parallel _ to the shock front , and stepped through a grid of positions spanning the width of the filament .",
    "the observations were obtained on april 29 , 1999 as part of hst go program 7289 ( pi blair ) .",
    "the 52  @xmath6  05 slit was used along with the g140l grating .",
    "the wavelength coverage is 1118    - 1716   , and since the source is diffuse and fills the width of the slit , the spectral resolution is @xmath0  12   .",
    "though the slit itself is longer , the effective aperture length in the spatial direction is restricted to 25  by the dimensions of the fuv - mama detector . in figure [ slitpos ] the effective aperture is shown overlaid on a wfpc2 h@xmath1 image of the filament .",
    "the slit was placed via blind offset after first acquiring a nearby star with an optical peak - up acquisition .",
    "three exposures with a total integration time of 8202 seconds were taken at this position .",
    "the brightest part of the filament lying in the slit is at r.a .",
    "20:56:05.80 and dec .",
    "+ 31:56:13.9 ( j2000 ) . in the figure",
    "the shock is propagating upwards ( i.e.  approximately ne ) ; the region below the filament is the interior of the snr , and the region above is the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .    in this paper",
    ", we are using standard data products generated on february 1 , 2000 with the `` on the fly '' pipeline calibration available from stsci . in this mode ,",
    "the best available calibration reference files are used .",
    "the reduced 2-d spectra for each of the three exposures were co - added .",
    "the ly-@xmath1 and o  i airglow lines at 1216    and 1304    respectively were subtracted from the 2-d spectrum using line profiles taken along the dispersion axis at a `` background '' ism location .",
    "figure [ 2dfull ] shows the resulting 2-d spectrum with annotations indicating the main spectral and spatial features .",
    "the slit passes through three distinct shock tangencies ( figure [ slitpos ] ) .",
    "we will designate the brightest emission near the center as the `` bright shock '' and the sharp , narrow filaments above and below it as the `` north shock '' and `` south shock '' respectively .",
    "the spatial positions of these shocks are marked in figure [ 2dfull ] .",
    "we note that these shocks are in front of and behind the bright shock only in projection , and physically they are part of the same `` sheet '' at the edge of the snr .",
    "furthermore , the bright shock itself has some substructure and may include multiple shock crossings along the line of sight .",
    "n  v @xmath21240 , o  v @xmath21371 , c  iv @xmath21549 , he  ii @xmath21640 , and the 2-photon continuum from the bright shock are well detected .",
    "the n  v , c  iv and he  ii lines from the fainter south shock are also detected .",
    "isolating the emission from the north shock is more difficult since the emission from these stronger lines fills the space between the bright and north shocks .",
    "in figure [ spec ] , we present the background subtracted spectra of the bright shock and the south shock .",
    "we obtained the 1-d spectra by averaging over several rows in the spatial direction , in each case corresponding to @xmath0 12 . the background spectrum subtracted from each of these shock spectra",
    "was obtained by extracting a 56 spatial region ahead of the shock , smoothing the result by 3 pixels to lower the noise , and scaling appropriately .",
    "the spectra shown in the plots have been rebinned over 4 pixels ( about 0.6   ) , and the flux at wavelengths covering the ly-@xmath1 and o  i 1304    airglow lines have been set to zero .",
    "the flux units in the plot are ergs  s@xmath4  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8  @xmath4 .",
    "the bright shock spectrum has been offset ( arbitrarily ) by 0.15 flux units .",
    "the n  v , c  iv and he  ii lines are seen in both the spectra .",
    "the 2-photon continuum is visible in the bright shock spectrum , but is much weaker in the south shock .",
    "additionally , weaker emission from o  v , the o  iv]-si  iv lines around 1400    and n  iv ] 1486    is detected in the bright shock spectrum .",
    "although the signal to noise is low , these detections are a remarkable advance in spatial sampling compared with earlier ultraviolet observations ( rbfg , hrb , l92 ) .    in table",
    "[ tblflux ] we present the reddening corrected fluxes of some emission lines , relative to n  v @xmath21240 = 100 , measured in our stis spectra of the bright and south shocks and in previous studies of the same filament ( rbfg , l92 ) .",
    "line fluxes in our spectrum were corrected for reddening following l92 , who used @xmath9 and the mean galactic extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "we find from their table 1 that the observed , uncorrected fluxes of n  v , o  v , c  iv and he  ii have to be multiplied by _ 2.03 , 1.89 , 1.82 _ and _ 1.80 _ , respectively .",
    "however , no account has been taken of possible resonance line scattering of n  v and c  iv photons .    in table",
    "[ tblflux ] we see that the c  iv and he  ii lines are significantly stronger , relative to n  v , in our spectra than in the earlier data .",
    "( due to the low signal , the o  v flux we measure is very uncertain and is consistent with l92 ) .",
    "the iue spectra presented by rbfg used a 10  by 20  aperture and the hut spectrum presented by l92 used a 94 by 116  aperture , whereas the region covered in each of our measurements is approximately 05 by 12 , immediately behind the balmer shock front .",
    "this is strong evidence that the line ratios depend upon the spatial scale being observed . in particular , the comparison shows that n  v emission must come from a more extended region than the c  iv and the he  ii .",
    "similar variations in uv line ratios were seen by hrb in iue spectra taken at 7 positions along another balmer filament in the ne cygnus loop ( their filament 2 ) .",
    "for example , their table 6 shows that the c  iv to n  v ratio varied between 0.58 and 1.43",
    ". hrb discuss one particular spectrum where n  v is stronger than expected and explain the enhanced emission as coming from cooling coronal gas , where the gas was ionized at an earlier time by a shock with a higher velocity .",
    "the distribution of the he  ii , c  iv and n  v emitting gas is important for understanding the recent evolution of the shock ( and thereby the snr and surrounding ism ) .",
    "however , we will postpone further discussion of this subject to paper ii , where we will present several long slit stis spectra covering a larger spatial region .",
    "now we turn to the spatial structure of the emission just behind the shock fronts .",
    "in figure [ space ] we present the observed flux in several lines as a function of position along the slit .",
    "the top panel shows the region around the bright shock and the bottom panel shows the region around the south shock .",
    "the fluxes ( except for h@xmath1 ) have been obtained from the stis spectrum by integrating over the lines along each row ; in the case of 2 photon emission , the integration was between 1420    and 1460   .",
    "the h@xmath1 flux is from the wfpc2 image , taking a cross - cut along the slit , and averaging across its width .",
    "the counts in the image were converted to flux units using the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "the peak of the 2-photon emission is chosen as the @xmath10 position , and @xmath11 increases towards the interior of the snr ( i.e.  shocks move right to left in these plots ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission profile is aligned so that its peak coincides with the 2-photon emission peak . in the plots",
    ", the profiles obtained from the stis spectrum have been binned by 4 pixels ( 01 ) for the bright shock ( top panel ) and by 10 pixels ( 025 ) for the south shock ( bottom panel ) .    the separation between the n  v emission zone and the shock front is clearly resolved in the spatial profiles of the bright shock ( figure [ space ] , top panel ) .",
    "this is expected in non - radiative shocks . after entering the shock front",
    "the gas takes time to reach successively higher ionization states ; and so at a given instant , the ionization state of the gas increases with distance behind the shock front .",
    "therefore , h@xmath1 and 2-photon emission arise immediately behind the shock front , followed by he  ii , c  iv and then n  v emission .",
    "the _ hst _ spectrum has enabled us to partially resolve this stratified structure in a non - radiative snr shock for the first time .",
    "the separation between the c  iv and n  v emission can also be seen in the noisier south shock profiles ( figure [ space ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "we can quantify the separation between the c  iv and n  v zones by measuring the locations of the peaks for the bright shock .",
    "for the noisier south shock , the offset between the leading edges of the c  iv and n  v zones is a measure of their separation .",
    "we obtain a separation of 030@xmath12010 for the bright shock and 030@xmath12025 for the south shock , and use these values in the discussion below . at our assumed distance of the cygnus loop ( 440 pc ) , 03 corresponds to about @xmath13  cm .",
    "the shock structure , including the intensities and spatial profiles of the ultraviolet lines , depends mainly on the shock velocity and the pre - shock density . in the case of a non - radiative shock , such as the one being considered here ,",
    "the ionization is not necessarily complete in the post shock flow , and the resulting spectrum is also a function of the swept up column density .",
    "furthermore , the line strengths from any ionization state of an element heavier than helium scales linearly with the abundance .",
    "we can conveniently interpret our data and determine ( or constrain ) the balmer filament properties by comparing the observed spectrum with model predictions .",
    "we use an updated version of the raymond shock code ( described by @xcite and @xcite ) to calculate the shock models .",
    "the code considers a constant velocity shock running into a uniform medium and calculates the resulting structure , in particular the line emissivities as a function of swept up column ( or equivalently of distance behind the shock front ) .",
    "the most important updates for the present investigation are the ability to follow electron and ion temperatures separately and the use of ionization rates based on coulomb - born calculations ( e.  g.  @xcite ) .    in order to systematically examine the dependence of the shock spectrum on the shock velocity and pre - shock density , we have run a grid of models varying the shock velocity between 160  km  s@xmath4 and 200  km  s@xmath4 in steps of 10  km  s@xmath4 and with three values of the pre - shock density : 1  @xmath3 , 2  @xmath3 and 4  @xmath3 .",
    "we assume abundances representative of the diffuse ism , taken from @xcite .",
    "the he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe and ni abundances are 10.99 , 8.40 , 7.90 , 8.70 , 8.09 , 7.10 , 6.50 , 7.51 , 6.45 , 4.61 , 5.80 and 4.26 on a scale where the logarithm of the h abundance is 12.00 .",
    "we are assuming that no elements are liberated from grains due to the shock until after the ultraviolet line formation .",
    "this is a valid assumption since the emission region we are considering is formed within about 200 years after the passage of the shock front whereas studies have shown that the time scale for grain destruction due to such shocks is a few thousand years ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these basic quantities , the shock models require other input parameters .",
    "following rbfg , the neutral fraction of the pre - shock gas was taken to be 30% in all cases .",
    "( the h@xmath1 and 2-photon intensities depend on the density of neutrals entering the shock front .",
    "however ly@xmath14 photons can also be converted to h@xmath1 plus 2-photon continuum and contribute significantly to their intensities . therefore using the observed h@xmath1 and 2-photon intensities to determine the neutral fraction requires detailed analysis of the ly@xmath14 radiative transfer , which is beyond the scope of this paper ) .",
    "the extent of equilibration between electrons and ions in the shock front is also unknown ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) , but @xcite has used balmer line profiles to show that @xmath15 is at least 80% as large as @xmath16 in a slightly faster shock in the northern cygnus loop . in any case , we find that assuming rapid equilibration in the shock front or slower coulomb equilibration in the post - shock gas has a minor effect on the ultraviolet line strengths and a negligible effect on the spatial profiles .",
    "( a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in all the models we present , rapid equilibration ( @xmath17 everywhere in the post - shock gas ) has been assumed .",
    "the value of the pre - shock magnetic field is important in determining the properties of the gas and the grain dynamics in the cooling zone of the post - shock flow where both the gas and the field are highly compressed .",
    "however , the structure and emission properties of the ionization zone that we consider here are independent of the pre - shock field .",
    "in all the models , we use a value of 0.1  @xmath18 g for the pre - shock magnetic field .",
    "( we find that models using pre - shock fields of 1  @xmath18 g give the same results ) .",
    "the pre - shock gas temperature in all models is 10,000  k ( e.  g.  hrb ) .      before moving on to the main analysis , we present an example of the emission line structure predicted by a shock model .",
    "the example uses a shock velocity of 180  km  s@xmath4 and a pre - shock density of 2  @xmath3 which are the `` best fit '' values found by l92 , who compared shock models with their hut data .",
    "the top panel in figure [ mods ] shows the emissivities of he  ii  @xmath21640 , c  iv  @xmath21549 and n  v  @xmath21240 , normalized to their respective maxima , plotted as a function of distance behind the shock front .",
    "the stratification of the post - shock gas is evident , with emission from the lowest ionization species occurring first .",
    "the n  v emission zone is well separated from the he  ii and c  iv zones and extends over a larger spatial region .    in the bottom panel of figure [ mods ] the cumulative intensity ( in ergs  s@xmath4",
    "@xmath7 ) of the lines is plotted .",
    "the cumulative intensity of a line at a given distance is the intensity in the line produced up to that point in the post - shock flow and coming out of the front of the shock .",
    "we see that the he  ii and c  iv intensities level off about @xmath19  cm and @xmath20  cm behind the shock front while the n  v intensity continues to rise .",
    "( this is evident from the emissivity plot where the n  v zone extends beyond 10@xmath21  cm ) .",
    "therefore , for a given shock velocity and pre - shock density , the emission line spectrum depends upon the spatial extent of the post - shock region , which in turn depends on the amount of material swept up by the shock . in these plots",
    "we have shown emission out to 10@xmath21  cm , here corresponding to a swept up column of about @xmath22  @xmath7 .",
    "we have calculated the separation between the c  iv and n  v emission peaks for the grid of models , and we plot the results in figure [ sep ] .",
    "the shock velocity is plotted along the x - axis , and different symbols are used to represent models with different pre - shock densities .",
    "the separation between the zones decreases with increasing shock velocity , and for a given shock velocity the separation scales linearly with pre - shock density .",
    "the physical separation corresponding to the observed angular separation of 03 depends on the distance of the cygnus loop .",
    "we recently found the distance to the cygnus loop to be @xmath23  pc , combining the proper motion of the balmer filament ( using our wfpc2 image and a 1953 poss - i image ) with the range of shock velocities found for the filament ( @xcite ) .",
    "in figure [ sep ] , the dotted line is at @xmath24  cm , which corresponds to 03 at 440  pc .",
    "the dashed lines are at @xmath25  cm and @xmath26  cm , which correspond to 02 at 340  pc and 04 at 570  pc .",
    "they represent the limits of the observed separation taking into account the distance uncertainty as well as the @xmath1201 uncertainty in the measurement for the bright shock (  3 and figure [ space ] ) .",
    "one of the factors influencing the observed separation is the geometry of the shock front along the line of sight .",
    "curvature will typically have the effect of making the observed separation between the zones larger than the intrinsic separation . in order to make a simple quantitative estimate of this effect ,",
    "we have assumed that the shock front can be approximated by the arc of a circle .",
    "we then integrate the model predicted emissivities along lines of sight that are chords to the circle .",
    "using a radius of curvature of @xmath27  cm ( estimated from the h@xmath1 image , figure [ slitpos ] ) , we find the following . for the 180  km  s@xmath4 shock with pre - shock density of 2  @xmath3 , the separation is increased to @xmath28  cm and for the 200  km  s@xmath4 shock with pre - shock density of 4  @xmath3 , the separation is increased to @xmath29  cm .",
    "therefore , shocks at the lower end of the velocity range and with lower densities are ruled out by the observed separation .",
    "however , shocks with higher velocities and higher densities can not be ruled out on the basis of these data .",
    "as we have seen (  4.1 , figure [ mods ] ) the shock spectrum for a given shock velocity and pre - shock density depends on the amount of swept up material , or equivalently on the width of the post - shock region . in order to compare the grid of models with the observed spectrum , we need to specify this parameter . the spectrum in figure [ spec ] and the line strengths ( from our observations ) in table [ tblflux ]",
    "are based on a 12 region behind the shock front .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath30  cm at 440  pc .",
    "we therefore fix the width of the post - shock region in the shock models to be this value . truncated in this way",
    ", the swept up column density depends most strongly on the pre - shock density ( and is largely independent of the shock velocity ) . in our grid of models , these column densities are approximately @xmath31  @xmath7 , @xmath32  @xmath7 , and @xmath33  @xmath7 for pre - shock densities of 1 , 2 and 4  @xmath3 , respectively .    in figure [ int ]",
    "we plot the n  v intensities predicted by the models . as in figure [ sep ] , the shock velocity is plotted along the x - axis and different symbols are used for different pre - shock densities .",
    "the n  v intensity increases with pre - shock density ( as is expected ) , since a greater column of gas is swept up .",
    "the n  v intensity decreases with increasing shock velocity .",
    "this happens because temperatures in the post - shock gas go as the square of the shock velocity ( @xcite ) and in faster shocks , elements are ionized to higher stages ( e.  g.  n  vi for nitrogen ) more rapidly .",
    "this results in fewer collisional excitations that lead to the production of line photons .",
    "the intensities shown in figure [ int ] apply to the case when the shock is viewed face - on .",
    "the cygnus loop filament however represents the other extreme - a shock viewed more or less tangentially .",
    "therefore , in order to compare with the predictions , the observed value has to be corrected for viewing angle and geometry .",
    "the correction factor is the ratio of the actual shock area observed to the projected shock area . this observed intensity has to be divided by this aspect ratio to obtain the predicted `` face - on '' intensity . from a ground based h@xmath1 image of the filaments in this region ,",
    "hrb estimated an aspect ratio of 10 for the _ diffuse _",
    "( i.  e.  least tangential ) emission . from the wfpc2 h@xmath1 image ( presented by @xcite ) , we find that the aspect ratio could easily be as high as 50 for bright filaments .",
    "the reddening corrected , n  v intensity of the bright shock is 3.6  @xmath34  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 ( table [ tblflux ] and  3 ) . for an aspect ratio of 50 , this corresponds to a model predicted value of 7.2  @xmath35  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 , which is shown as a dotted line in figure [ int ] .",
    "the discussion above shows that the range of shock properties we have considered predicts the n  v intensity more or less correctly .",
    "however , our rather crude estimate of the aspect ratio from the morphology of the filaments in the plane of the sky can not be used to place very strong constraints on the shock properties .",
    "for instance , if the aspect ratio were higher or lower by a factor of 2 for the observed region , the measured n  v intensity would be compatible with many of the models",
    ". it would be very difficult , though , to reconcile the observed value with the n@xmath36  =  1  @xmath3 models  the predicted intensity is far too low .",
    "recalling that the c  iv ",
    "n  v separation also rules out the low density , low velocity , models ( figure [ sep ] ) , we conclude that the pre - shock gas ahead of the non - radiative filament has a density of at least 2  @xmath3 .",
    "in figure [ rat ] we plot the c  iv to n  v line ratio for the grid of models ( truncated at a width of @xmath30  cm ) .",
    "the c  iv to n  v ratio is higher for lower values of pre - shock density because the swept up column density is lower and the n  v zone is less complete ( see figure [ mods ] ) .",
    "the dependence of this ratio on shock velocity is more subtle - since it is affected both by the swept up column and the rate of ionization to higher ionization states .",
    "the observed c  iv to n  v ratio , corrected for reddening is 1.01 for the bright shock 0.84 for the south shock .",
    "these values are consistent with the shock models having pre - shock densities of 2 and 4  @xmath3 . however , as we discuss below , the intrinsic ratio of c  iv to n  v can be affected by resonance line scattering .",
    "the edge - on viewing angle implies that we are looking through a relatively large column of emitting gas .",
    "the optical depth of the n  v and c  iv lines , which are ground state transitions , can get high enough to significantly attenuate the line intensities . to estimate the effect of resonance line scattering",
    ", we have used the emission profiles from our illustrative model (  4.1 ) , assumed a single shock front with a fixed radius of curvature ( i.  e.  that it is an arc of a circle ) , and calculated optical depths along tangential lines of sight .",
    "we find that the c  iv optical depth ( @xmath37 ) is invariably higher than the n  v optical depth ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we also find that the ratio @xmath37/@xmath38 increases with increasing optical depth ( of either line ) .",
    "specifically , for a radius of curvature @xmath39 cm , @xmath40 and @xmath41 and for a radius of curvature @xmath42 cm , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we note that in calculating the optical depths we have assumed that the kinetic temperature of the heavy ions is equal to the proton temperature . if the ionic temperatures are higher ( as is the case for the remnant sn1006 , @xcite ) , the lines will be broader and optical depths correspondingly lower .",
    "the attenuation of the line intensity for a given optical depth , assuming single scattering , is @xmath45 . for the cases mentioned above ,",
    "the intrinsic ratio of c  iv to n  v would be higher than the observed ratio by factors of 1.1 and 1.5 for the smaller and larger radii of curvature , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic n  v intensity in these two cases would be 1.7 and 2.8 times the observed ( dereddened ) intensity . in the context of our models , a c  iv to n  v ratio of 1.5 would imply that the pre - shock density is somewhat lower than 2  @xmath3 ( figure [ rat ] ) . for this `` high optical depth '' case , the n  v intensity assuming an aspect ratio of 50 , would be about @xmath46  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "( that is , the dashed line in figure [ int ] would have to be placed much higher ) . then , to make the observation consistent with a low pre - shock density , the aspect ratio would have to be over 200 ( rather than 50 ) , which is extreme .",
    "our models therefore favor a scenario where the n  v and c  iv optical depths are modest , and the lines are not highly attenuated .",
    "we note , however , that our treatment is very simplistic . to make accurate models for the observed emission , a detailed treatment of the line scattering using a realistic geometry",
    "is needed .",
    "the observed value of the he  ii to n  v line ratio , corrected for reddening is 1.36 for the bright shock .",
    "models predict much lower values - between about 0.1 and 0.4 .",
    "the model does not take into account the production of the 1640  line by he  ii ly@xmath14 256  photons and so a lower predicted flux is expected ( e.  g.  rbfg ) .",
    "@xcite has calculated the expected he  ii  @xmath21640 flux for a range of shock velocities . from figure 1 of that paper , we find that our model predictions need to be corrected by factors of between 2 and 5 .",
    "additionally , any attenuation of n  v due to resonance scattering would increase the observed he  ii to n  v ratio , leading to a better match between models and observation .",
    "the models predict o  v to n  v of about 0.08 , which is lower than the observed , reddening corrected value of 0.19 for the bright shock .",
    "however in this case , the error in the observation is large enough that this difference may not be an issue .",
    "again , resonance scattering of n  v would increase the observed o  v to n  v ratio .    in conclusion , we point out that there are two kinds of uncertainty associated with comparing model line strengths with the observations .",
    "first , the observed intensity has to be converted to an intrinsic shock intensity and the conversion depends on the shock geometry along the line of sight as well as the effects of resonance line scattering .",
    "second , the intensities are functions of the elemental abundances , and of the cutoff column density both of which are input parameters for the models . for our chosen ism abundances , and reasonable geometries ,",
    "we find that the observations favor shock velocities @xmath0  170  km  s@xmath4 and preshock densities between 2 and 4  @xmath3 .",
    "we have presented a far - ultraviolet spectrum of a non - radiative filament on the north - east limb of the cygnus loop , obtained with stis . the slit length ( and hence the spatial axis of the spectrum )",
    "was chosen to be perpendicular to the filament , and therefore perpendicular to the shock front .",
    "the brightest lines detected in the 1118  - 1716  passband were n  v  @xmath21240 , c  iv  @xmath21549 and he  ii  @xmath21640 .",
    "the effective spatial resolution of the spectrum , @xmath001 , is an improvement over previous studies of the same filament and is important because it allows us to separate the emission from individual shock fronts and also to measure the separation of the c  iv and n  v emission zones in the post - shock flow . for a given shock front , the observed c  iv to n  v and he  ii to n  v line ratios in our stis spectrum are significantly higher than in spectra taken by iue and hut covering larger areas ( several square arcseconds )",
    "this difference is most probably due to a spatially extended component of n  v emission , such as cooling gas ionized at an earlier time as suggested by hrb .",
    "we have compared our spectrum with a grid of shock models and find that the observed separation of 03 between the c  iv and n  v zones excludes pre - shock densities @xmath47  2  @xmath3 for shock velocities @xmath48  180  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "( these models predict much larger separations between the zones ) .",
    "furthermore , models with pre - shock densities @xmath47  2  @xmath3 predict much weaker n  v and c  iv than observed ( assuming ism abundances and a reasonable path length of emitting gas along the line of sight ) .    as the premier example of a remnant",
    "whose optical and ultraviolet emission is dominated by shocks due to the interaction of the sn blast wave with the surrounding ism , the cygnus loop plays an important role in our understanding of `` middle - aged '' snrs .",
    "the spatial scale of the emission from the shocks responsible for the brightest balmer filaments is a few times 10@xmath49  cm .",
    "this means ( as we have shown ) that at the 440  pc distance of the cygnus loop , the detailed structure of the filaments can be resolved by hst .",
    "observations of the filaments at this high resolution are critical for a correct understanding of the shock conditions , since lower resolution observations average over larger regions which in general contain a complex substructure .",
    "( we again point out the difference between our and earlier spectra of the same filament , table [ tblflux ] ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "we need a realistic 3-dimensional model for the shock geometry and the ability to compute the effects of resonance line scattering .",
    "this would refine our interpretation of the observed spectra and place more stringent limits on the shock conditions responsible for the cygnus loop balmer filaments ."
