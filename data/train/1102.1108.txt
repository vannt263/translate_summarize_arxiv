    "as a planetary system forms , some planets or planetesimals , referred to as `` rogue '' planets , can enter hyperbolic orbits and be ejected from the system as a result of gravitational interactions with gas giant planets @xcite .",
    "furthermore , interaction with passing stars can eject planets from mature systems @xcite .",
    "the ability of a rogue planet to support life is of interest as a sort of pathological example of planetary habitability , because such a planet could potentially represent a viable option for interstellar panspermia @xcite , and because such a planet could be the closest source of extrasolar life for exploration by humanity in the distant future .",
    "since some sort of starting point is required to discuss the issue , a planet is often defined as habitable if it can sustain liquid water at its surface @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that if a rogue planet had an extremely high - pressure hydrogen atmosphere , pressure - broadening of far - infrared absorption by molecular hydrogen could support liquid water on the planet s surface as a result of the geothermal heat flux alone , making the planet potentially habitable .",
    "@xcite showed that terrestrial planets can be ejected with moons and that the resulting tidal dissipation could increase the geothermal heat flux by up to two orders of magnitude for @xmath1(@xmath2 yr ) .",
    "subglacial liquid water oceans sustained by internal heat flux on icy bodies represent an alternative type of habitat .",
    "it is well known that subglacial oceans are possible on moons around giant planets and on trans - neptunian objects in the solar system @xcite , as well as water - rich exoplanets in distant orbits @xcite . a possible terrestrial analog is lake vostok , a @xmath0125 m deep lake which is sustained by geothermal heat flux under @xmath04 km of ice on antarctica @xcite .",
    "@xcite have even argued that a terrestrial rogue planet , not attached to any star and receiving negligible energy at its surface , could sustain a subglacial liquid ocean if it had a thick enough ice layer .",
    "we wish to consider this point in more depth , including issues such as the potential for solid - state convection of ice , the potential effect of a thermally insulating frozen gas layer from outgassing of the mantle on an earth - like rogue planet , the effects of melting point suppression due to contaminants , and observational prospects . by earth - like , we mean specifically within an order of magnitude in mass and water complement , similar in composition of radionuclides in the mantle , and of similar age .",
    "a subglacial ocean on a rogue planet is interesting because it could serve as a habitat for life which could , for example , survive by exploiting chemical energy of rock that is continually exposed by an active mantle .",
    "we will refer to a rogue planet harboring a subglacial ocean as a steppenwolf planet , since any life in this strange habitat would exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe .",
    "we can imagine that the ice layer on top of an ocean on a steppenwolf planet will grow until either it reaches a steady state with the ice bottom at the melting point , or all available water freezes .",
    "geothermal heat from the interior of the steppenwolf planet will be carried through the ice layer by conduction , and potentially by convection in the lower , warmer , and less viscous portion of the ice layer .",
    "since convection transports heat much more efficiently than conduction , the steady - state ice thickness will be much larger if convection occurs , making it harder to maintain a subglacial ocean .    here",
    "we will calculate steady - state ice thicknesses when there is conduction only and when there is convection in the lower portion of the ice , and make the conservative assumption that the thicker solution is valid .",
    "we must acknowledge , however , that it is very difficult to establish definitively whether convection would occur , and the resulting ice thickness if it were to occur , without detailed knowledge of conditions in and microscale composition of the ice @xcite .",
    "more generally , we will make many simplifications , including considering the question within the framework of a one - dimensional ( vertical ) model , since our primary objective is to establish whether or not a steppenwolf planet is feasible .",
    "first we calculate the conductive steady - state thickness , @xmath3 . above @xmath0@xmath4",
    "k , the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of water ice is well - approximated by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the temperature in kelvin and @xmath7=651  w  m@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "dimensional analysis shows that thermal steady state is reached in @xmath9 years , much shorter than the timescale of decay of the geothermal heat flux",
    ". geothermal heat flux through the shell will be constant at steady state , since no heat is produced within the ice , as would occur by tidal heating of a frozen moon .",
    "since the steppenwolf planets we consider would be much larger and drier than the icy moons on which subglacial oceans are typically studied , we can assume that the ice thickness is much less than the planetary radius , yielding an exponential temperature profile through the ice and steady - state thickness , so that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the temperature at the ice  water interface ( the melting temperature ) , @xmath12 is the temperature at the top of the ice , and @xmath13 is the geothermal heat flux .",
    "decay of radioactive elements in earth s interior and primordial heat remaining from earth s formation lead to an average geothermal heat flux emanating from earth s surface of @xmath14=0.087  w  m@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this heat flux decays with time such that earth s geothermal heat flux may have been roughly twice its present value 3  gyr ago @xcite . in order to consider steppenwolf planets of different sizes",
    ", we use the radius  mass scaling @xmath16 for super - earths with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "heuristically , this yields a geothermal heat flux that scales as @xmath18 , or roughly as the square root of the mass .",
    "the pressure at the bottom of the ice layer is @xmath19  mpa for each kilometer of ice , scaling with mass as @xmath18 .",
    "the melting point of pure ice is @xmath20@xmath21  k at pressures less than @xmath22  mpa @xcite , although contaminants to pure ice such as chloride salts or ammonia could suppress the melting point by @xmath23  k @xcite .",
    "the steady - state thickness in the conductive regime is only logarithmically sensitive to @xmath11 , so we will take @xmath24  k in the estimates here , except that we will consider the eutectic point of an ammonia - water ice mixture at @xmath25  k to demonstrate the impact of contaminants . in steady - state , the temperature at the surface of a steppenwolf planet ( @xmath26 ) , i.e. , the top of the ice or frozen gas layer , will be set by a balance between thermal emission and geothermal heat flux , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the stefan  boltzmann constant .",
    "astrophysical radiation backgrounds @xcite are negligible .",
    "any gas present in the atmosphere at planetary ejection or outgassed subsequently by geological processes will tend to freeze into a low - thermal - conductivity blanket that could allow @xmath12 to exceed @xmath26 .",
    "a blanket formed by freezing earth s current atmosphere would only increase @xmath12 by about 4  k @xcite .",
    "isostatic adjustment @xcite , however , will tend to cause some continents or islands to rise above the layers of water and ice on an earth - like steppenwolf planet with an active mantle , allowing volcanoes to continuously emit gasses that can freeze onto the water ice surface . here",
    ", we will consider carbon dioxide because it is likely to be outgassed in significant quantities from an earth - like planet and it supports a stable layer with relatively high base temperature relative to other common gases . to find an upper bound on the impact of a frozen gas layer",
    ", we will assume that the layer is rayleigh  taylor stable with respect to the underlying water ",
    "ice , so it remains as a surface blanket . to find the temperature at the carbon - dioxide layer base",
    ", we note that the thermal conductivity of carbon dioxide again scales as @xmath29 ( here , in a more limited regime ) , but with constant of proportionality @xmath30  w  m@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we find that the maximum temperature supported is robustly @xmath31  k for earth - like steppenwolf planets and is determined by the weak temperature dependence of the melting curve @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath32  k reduces the required steady - state water - ice thickness by an order of magnitude .    at earth mass , the temperature at the bottom of a layer of solid co@xmath33 reaches the melting temperature of co@xmath33 for a layer thickness of @xmath34  km , or @xmath35  kg  m@xmath15 .",
    "venus atmosphere has a partial pressure of co@xmath33 of @xmath090  bar ( @xmath36  kg  m@xmath15 ) , which is roughly the vapor pressure of carbonate rocks at venus surface temperature , implying that there may be more carbon locked in rock in equilibrium with the atmosphere @xcite . the store of carbon in carbonate rocks in earth s interior is uncertain , but the continental crust is estimated to contain the equivalent of @xmath37  kg  m@xmath15 co@xmath33 and the mantle may contain 24 times this amount @xcite",
    ". therefore it appears reasonable to assume that a steppenwolf planet could have a sufficient complement of co@xmath33 to significantly elevate @xmath12 .",
    "since the viscosity of ice depends strongly on temperature @xcite , if ice convection were to occur on a steppenwolf planet , it would occur only in the lower , warmer ice regions and would be capped by a `` stagnant '' conducting lid @xcite .",
    "we calculate the steady - state ice thickness when convection occurs following @xcite , who assume a newtonian rheology .",
    "we outline the solution here , but the reader should consult @xcite for more detail .",
    "we assume that convection occurs below temperature @xmath38 ( at higher temperature ) and determine @xmath38 by assuming that the viscosity is reduced by a factor @xmath39 over the convecting region , where the viscosity is given by the relation , @xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath41  pa  s , @xmath42 is the melting temperature , and @xmath43 . assuming that @xmath44 , we can solve for @xmath38 . a nusselt ",
    "rayleigh number scaling ( nu @xmath45ra@xmath46 ) yields the thickness of the convecting region between temperature @xmath38 and @xmath11 , @xmath47^{\\beta},\\ ] ] where we evaluate the viscosity at the mean temperature of the convecting layer , @xmath48 , @xmath49  m@xmath50  s@xmath8 , @xmath51  k@xmath8 , @xmath52  kg  m@xmath53 , @xmath54  w  m@xmath8  k@xmath8 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "taking @xmath57 to be constant in the convecting layer is a reasonable assumption given that the temperature is nearly constant within it .",
    "we add the thickness of the convective layer given by equation ( [ eq : hconv ] ) to the thickness of the stagnant lid , @xmath58 , to find the total ice thickness when there is convection .",
    "when the total thickness with convection exceeds the conductive thickness given by equation ( [ eq : hcond ] ) , we use it for the ice thickness .",
    "this corresponds to a critical rayleigh number of roughly 1000 within the convecting layer .",
    "given that the ice composition on a steppenwolf planet is unknown and the ice material properties under appropriate conditions are poorly - constrained , our convective calculation should be viewed as a rough estimate .",
    "for example , following @xcite and @xcite , we have assumed newtonian ice flow , which may or may not be realistic @xcite . creep mechanisms with stress - dependent viscosity , however , should yield results roughly similar to newtonian flow @xcite .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the appropriate ice grain size , the typical size of individual components of polycrystalline ice . in general , larger grain sizes correspond to higher viscosities , making convection less likely . the value of , @xmath59 that we have used , @xmath60  pa  s , corresponds to an ice grain size of @xmath00.1 mm @xcite . for reference ,",
    "the typical ice grain size on terrestrial ice sheets is @xmath61  mm @xcite and @xcite assume an ice grain size of 0.2 mm for their calculations of convection on icy extrasolar planets .",
    "competing estimates of ice grain size on europa , however , place it at either @xmath62@xmath63  mm or @xmath64  mm @xcite .",
    "although the appropriate ice grain size on a steppenwolf planet is a source of uncertainty , we have used a relatively small value , which is conservative in that it makes convection more likely to occur .",
    "finally , the constant @xmath65 can take different values between @xmath66 depending on the geometry and boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we have used a fairly high value of @xmath65 , which leads to a conservatively strong scaling of @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "a steppenwolf planet with mean ocean depth greater than the steady - state ice thickness , accounting for the ice - water density difference , will have an ocean under its ice layer .",
    "figure [ fig : cond_phase ] shows the required ice thickness to achieve liquid water in several scenarios .",
    "it is expected that the abundance of water on planetary surfaces varies greatly @xcite , but we can consider a simple scaling to understand how the conditions for liquid water scale with planet mass and water complement . at fixed planetary water mass fraction and fraction of water at the surface ( rather than in the mantle ) , the depth of the ocean scales approximately as the typical depth at earth mass ( @xmath69 ) times @xmath18 .",
    "figure [ fig : cond_phase ] shows contours for planets with water complements that are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath4 and @xmath72 times that of earth . combining this scaling with equation ( [ eq : hcond ] and [ eq : hconv ] )",
    ", we find that if a steppenwolf planet is similar to earth in water mass fraction ( @xmath73  km ) , radionuclide composition , age , and has no frozen co@xmath33 layer , it must be @xmath74 times more massive than earth to sustain a subglacial liquid ocean .",
    "contaminants which suppress the melting point have little effect on the conductive ice thickness , but significantly reduce the ability of the ice to convect .",
    "if a steppenwolf planet has ten times more water ( @xmath75 ) than earth or if it has a thick frozen co@xmath33 layer which reaches the maximum temperature of @xmath31  k at its base , the planet must be only @xmath76 times earth s mass to have a liquid ocean .",
    "we expect that detection of reflected sunlight in the optical wavebands and ir follow - up present the only viable observational choices in the near term . for a single - visit limiting magnitude @xmath77 of lsst @xcite ( and comparable @xmath78 in the nearer - term pan - starrs ) , and albedo of @xmath79 , the limiting distance out to which an object can be detected with reflected sunlight is @xmath80  au .",
    "the palomar survey of @xmath8112,000  @xmath82 to magnitude @xmath83 @xcite has discovered no such objects outside of the smaller trans - neptunians such as sedna .    the baseline requirement to identify a steppenwolf planet is a detection of thermal emission in the far - ir .",
    "the flux at the wien maximum is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the earth - object separation . at 10  @xmath86 , @xmath87",
    "k so that @xmath88 . here , the @xmath89 pacs instrument reaches a 40 beams / source confusion limit at a flux of @xmath0@xmath90  mjy ( , suggesting a limiting distance of @xmath0@xmath91  au ; pacs reaches @xmath4  mjy at @xmath92 in @xmath71  hr @xcite ) .",
    "higher resolution is required to progress to lower flux limits . at @xmath93 ,",
    "the planned @xmath94  m cornell - caltech atacama telescope ( ccat ) would reach the source confusion limit at @xmath95  mjy .",
    "photometric microlensing has also been proposed as a method to detect rogue planets throughout the galaxy @xcite .",
    "if each stellar system ejects one @xmath96 planet , a survey like the galactic exoplanet survey telescope could anticipate @xmath81@xmath97 detections of rogue planets @xcite .",
    "typical distances to these objects would exceed the capabilities of follow - up that could elucidate their nature .",
    "free - floating super - jupiters have been discovered , but these represent a different class of objects .",
    "a steppenwolf planet s lifetime will be limited by the decay of the geothermal heat flux , which is determined by the half - life of its stock of radioisotopes ( @xmath98k , @xmath99u,@xmath100th ) and by the decay of its heat of formation .",
    "as these decay times are @xmath81@xmath101  gyr , its lifetime is comparable to planets in the traditional habitable zone of main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "if a steppenwolf planet harbors life , it could have originated in a more benign era before ejection from the host star .",
    "alternatively , after ejection , life could originate around hydrothermal vents , which are a proposed location for the origin of life on earth @xcite .",
    "if life can originate and survive on a steppenwolf planet , it must be truly ubiquitous in the universe .",
    "we have shown that an earth - like rogue planet drifting through interstellar space could harbor a subglacial liquid ocean despite its low emission temperature , and so might be considered habitable . such an object could be detected and followed - up using current technology if it passed within @xmath1(1000 au ) of earth .",
