    "the importance of the quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetically ( afm ) ordered systems , corroborated by the fact that the high - temperature superconducting cuprate parent compounds , @xmath2 for instance , belong to that class of systems , highly justifies their decades - long presence in the scientific literature .",
    "the interest is especially devoted to their magnetic properties in order to elucidate the underlying microscopic mechanism of the high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "though the 2d spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model with only the nearest neighbour ( nn ) interaction coupling @xmath3 was frequently used as the research initial point @xcite , numerous studies , both theoretical and experimental , have in the meanwhile indicated the significance of taking into account other exchange interactions ( see @xcite and references therein ) , leading to the study of the frustrated spin systems @xcite .",
    "most emphasized is the relevance of the planar frustration , induced by the next-(nnn ) or next - next - nearest ( nnnn ) neighbour interaction @xmath4 , as well as the cyclic exchange @xmath5 comprising four - spin plaquette interaction , often recognized as the second strongest exchange interaction in the system .    the self - consistent spin - wave theory ( scswt ) with its numerous versions is widely used for the analysis of the heisenberg layered magnets ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our research was primarily motivated by the study of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) antiferromagnet with the planar frustration and cyclic exchange interaction within the scswt performed in ref .",
    "the theory was applied strictly to @xmath2 , without giving a detailed study of the dependence of the model magnetic properties on the varying values of the exchange interactions contained in hamiltonian .",
    "this , however , may be interesting to investigate , especially since it is experimentally possible to vary the frustration ratio @xmath6 by applying high pressures on the system @xcite .",
    "the present paper is intended to be a comprehensive study on the influence of planar frustration ratio , cyclic exchange and interplanar exchange interaction on the spin - wave spectrum , ground - state sublattice magnetization , spin - wave velocity renormalization factor and ground - state energy of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum antiferromagnet with @xmath7 within the self - consistent spin - wave theory .",
    "we shall determine the exchange parameter region where the ground state of the n ' eel type exists .",
    "the existence of the other long - range ordering patterns ( columnar phase , for instance ) , as well as the intermediate quantum disordered phases , will not be the issue of this paper .",
    "the scsw approach will be compared to the linear spin - wave theory ( lswt ) results , as well as the results of second - order perturbative spin - wave expansion from @xcite .",
    "the influence of the third nearest neighbour interaction on sublattice magnetization will be analyzed , which to our knowledge has not been earlier discussed within the framework of scswt applied on the above introduced model .",
    "special attention will be devoted to the high-@xmath1 superconducting parent compound @xmath2 , thoroughly studied in the literature . using the improved experimental in - plane spin - wave dispersion @xcite",
    "we shall find the corrected exchange parameter set , whereby we shall calculate spin - wave dispersion at high temperatures and compare it both to the experiment from the ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as to the numerically obtained spectrum from @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the model hamiltonian and introduce the dominant exchange interactions . in section 3 the hamiltonian is mapped into the bosonic form based on the dyson - maleev ( dm ) transformation .",
    "mean - field decoupling of the fourth - order terms is performed and main expressions for the quantities to be analyzed are derived by making use of the self - consistent spin - wave theory .",
    "the numerically calculated results are plotted and analyzed in detail in sec .",
    "the conclusions are shortly stated in sec .",
    "the dominant interactions for the @xmath7 antiferromagnet on the tetragonal lattice are presented in figure 1 and comprised in the following heisenberg hamiltonian : @xmath8 @xmath9 .-(____+_2 ) ( _ _ + _ 1__+_3)]+ j___a,_^ab__a__a+_^ab+__,_^____+_^.[hamiltonian1]the first two terms include the interactions between the first , second and third nearest neighbours within the plane .",
    "the position of the spin in the sublattice @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is denoted by @xmath12 , while the vectors connecting the given spin and its corresponding neighbours are denoted by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the third term presents the cyclic exchange interaction , described by the exchange integral @xmath5 .",
    "the vectors connecting the spins in a plaquette read : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the interplanar interaction is described by the last two terms , where the vectors @xmath18 designate the vectors connecting the antiferro-/ferromagnetically coupled nearest neighbour spins in adjacent planes .",
    "all interactions are assumed to be antiferromagnetic , i.e. @xmath3 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 , @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "contrary to refs .",
    "@xcite , we observe that hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) includes the next - next - nearest neighbour planar interaction , enabling us to incorporate in the present study the influence of this interaction in the n ' eel phase .",
    "it is common to define the fundamental energy scale by the nn exchange interaction @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we introduce the dimensionless ratios and study their influence on the spin - wave spectrum , ground - state sublattice magnetization etc .",
    "these quantities are the frustration ratio @xmath23 , the ratio @xmath24 parametrizing the relative strength of the cyclic exchange and the ratio @xmath25 parametrizing the relative strength of the interplanar interaction .",
    "in order to determine the spin - wave spectrum , we apply a variant of the non - linear spin - wave theory @xcite .",
    "the spin operators in hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) are first written in the local coordinate system @xcite and then expressed as boson operators using the well - known dyson - maleev transformation in the form @xmath26 ^z = s-^____,=a , b.[dajson]in terms of these operators , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) is mapped into an equivalent hamiltonian of interacting bosons , which may be written as = h_0+_2+_4,[hamiltonian2]where @xmath27 presents the classical ground - state energy , @xmath28 denotes the bilinear part of the hamiltonian which corresponds to the non - interacting spin waves ( lsw ) , while @xmath29 describes the interaction among spin waves induced via transformations ( [ dajson ] ) and consists of the terms quartic in bose operators .",
    "the terms of the higher order are immediately neglected .",
    "we then simplify the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) in the spirit of the wick s theorem @xcite , in the manner similar to the one implemented in ref .",
    "the manner in which the quartic terms are evaluated is illustrated on the following example : @xmath30 + 2^__a+_1__a+_1__a^__a+_1+^__a+_1^__a+_1__a__a+_1,[dekuplovanje]where the single brackets @xmath31 indicate averages over the canonical ensemble at temperature @xmath32 . as a consequence of dm transformation ,",
    "the obtained hamiltonian is non - hermitian .",
    "therefore , we symmetrize it by adding the hermitian conjugate terms to the non - hermitian ones @xcite . after decoupling procedure",

    "the sublattice magnetization in the absence of the external magnetic field is given by ^z(a)=s-_. [ mag_podresetke ]    finally , we shall examine the spin - wave velocity renormalization factor @xmath45 in 2d case .",
    "namely , in the long - wave limit , the spin - wave dispersion vanishes linearly according to e()~ck , k=0,[dugotalasna_granica]where @xmath46 presents the spin - wave velocity given by c=2z_c j s[brzina_spin_tal].therefrom , the renormalization factor @xmath45 reads z_c=.[renorm_faktor ]    all the numerical calculations will be performed based on upper expressions .",
    "in order to describe the ground - state behavior of the system we perform the calculation of the spin - wave spectrum for the 2d model within lsw and scsw theory , based on numerical evaluation of eqs .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) , ( [ alfa ] ) and ( [ spektar ] ) , where we put @xmath47 . in the lsw approach ,",
    "@xmath41 quantities in last two expressions equal unity , while within the scsw approach the cumbersome system of eqs .",
    "( [ epsilon])-([korelac_funkcije ] ) has to be solved .",
    "due to its self - consistency , the iterative procedure has to be applied . in figure 2",
    "we show the comparison between the spin - wave spectra along the high symmetry directions in the 2d afm brillouin zone ( for the tetragonal phase ) obtained within the lsw ( blue line ) and scsw ( red solid line ) theory , for the relative frustration @xmath48 and cyclic exchange @xmath49 .",
    "we also show the results obtained as the first correction to the lswt result , i.e. by inserting the lsw results in the scsw expressions , without performing the self - consistent procedure ( presented in fig .",
    "1 with the red dashed line ) .",
    "if not stated otherwise , hereafter we assume that @xmath50 equals @xmath51 @xcite and do not emphasize the value of the former for brevity .",
    "while qualitatively lswt and scswt results resemble each other , the scswt gives significant contribution to the entire dispersion curve .",
    "further , it can be seen that the scswt results differ only slightly from the first correction to the lswt and only in the vicinity of the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "other choices of exchange parameters confirm this observation , whereby this difference grows with the increase of @xmath52 , though very slowly , being less than @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which may bring us to the conclusion that the tedious procedure of solving the aforementioned system of equations iteratively is not justified .",
    "though , the study of the ground - state sublattice magnetization and other quantities of interest will show that it is necessary to employ the scsw theory in order to avoid the divergences which arise from taking the first correction to the lswt only .    in figure 3a )",
    "we present the lsw theory results for the spin - wave spectra for different values of parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is obvious that with the increase of frustration , the magnon energies get lowered , with a clearly observable dip from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , meaning that the excitation energy at @xmath57 decreases more strongly than at @xmath56 .",
    "the dip grows with the frustration and is absent only for @xmath58 and @xmath49 , as also stated in ref .",
    "the increase of cyclic exchange for fixed @xmath51 supports the softening of @xmath57 mode , while the @xmath56 mode remains unaffected , which presents the shortcoming of the lsw approach .",
    "this drawback is removed within the scswt , as seen in figure 3b ) , where the evolution of the spin - wave spectra with varying parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 is plotted . within scswt",
    "the increase in @xmath52 softens also the @xmath56 mode , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "we observe that even in the absence of the cyclic interaction there exists a dip from @xmath56 to @xmath57 ( except for @xmath58 ) , which grows with frustration .",
    "hence , in this case , scsw theory gives result opposite to the one obtained within the second - order perturbative spin expansion @xcite , which predicts the dip of the same sign only for the substantial cyclic exchange , while for @xmath49 the inverse dip from @xmath57 to @xmath56 is obtained .",
    "we proceed with the calculation of the ground - state sublattice magnetization , again for the 2d model at first , by making use of the expression ( [ mag_podresetke ] ) , whereby we again have to apply the iterative procedure .",
    "the lswt and scswt results for the zero - temperature magnetization dependence on the frustration ratio are compared in figure 4a ) .",
    "since the presence of frustration disorders the system , the sublattice magnetization @xmath59 is gradually reduced by the increase of @xmath51 , i.e. the zero - point quantum fluctuations grow .",
    "the magnetization within scswt is enhanced and decreases more slowly compared to the lswt predictions , in accordance with @xcite . the apparent divergence which arises within the non - linear sw theory including the first correction to @xmath60 order only ( shown in figure 4a ) by the dashed lines ) ,",
    "is successfully removed by allowing for the scsw approach .",
    "this conclusion agrees with those quoted in @xcite .",
    "the sublattice magnetization dependence on the cyclic exchange parameter is presented in figure 4b ) .",
    "it can be seen that the cyclic exchange stabilizes the system , whereby the magnetization is enhanced within scswt .",
    "besides , the difference between the lsw and scsw theory results ( @xmath61 ) grows with the increase of the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the domain of the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 where the ground state of the n ' eel type exists for the model defined by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) within scswt , is limited .",
    "the corresponding parameter region is shown in the phase diagram in figure 5 .",
    "further , we study the influence of the third nearest neighbour interaction on the sublattice magnetization , in order to estimate its contribution to the ground - state sublattice magnetization .",
    "though the nnnn interaction was included in the hamiltonian in ref .",
    "@xcite , its influence on the model magnetic properties was not separately discussed .",
    "the comparison between the lswt and scswt results for the cases with and without the nnnn interaction ( for simplicity in the absence of cyclic exchange ) are presented in figure 6a ) .",
    "evidently , with the presence of the non - vanishing parameter @xmath50 the frustration in the antiferromagnet grows , additionally destabilizing the system .",
    "for instance , within the lswt , the critical value of @xmath51 at which the afm order is destroyed , equals approximately @xmath62 in the absence of nnnn interaction , which presents the result also stated in @xcite , while it falls to a much lower value of @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "the scswt results also corroborate this observation .",
    "next , we allow for the interplanar interaction between the adjacent planes which complicates the analysis significantly , since it introduces the additional frustration into the system ( see figure 1 ) . in order to examine the effects of the three - dimensionality on the behavior of the system , we determine the influence of the parameter @xmath65 on the ground - state sublattice magnetization .",
    "the calculated results are plotted in figure 6b ) both for the simple model with @xmath66 and the model with non - vanishing planar frustration and cyclic exchange .",
    "it may be seen that lsw and scsw theory show opposite tendency to each other . though lswt predicts the decrease in the magnetization with the grow of the parameter @xmath65 due to the frustration which destabilizes the system , scsw theory gives the growth in magnetization , as a consequence of the subtle interplay of the competing interactions .",
    "besides , we notice that the same change in the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 yields within lswt only a slight decrease of magnetization , while the increase within scswt is more significant .",
    "further , we calculate the spin - wave velocity renormalization factor by making use of expression ( [ renorm_faktor ] ) .",
    "we first increase the frustration ratio @xmath51 and calculate the renormalization factor for different cyclic exchange ratios @xmath52 in both lswt and scswt approach ( figure 7a ) ) .",
    "the results demonstrate that @xmath45 decreases with @xmath51 , the decrease being less rapid within the scsw theory .",
    "the divergence similar to the one appearing in the analysis of @xmath59 is again eliminated within scswt .",
    "the renormalization factor is also calculated in dependence of @xmath52 for different values of @xmath51 ( figure 7b ) ) , showing the more rapid decrease of @xmath45 within scswt .    finally , by making use of the expression ( [ energ_osn_stanja ] ) , we analyze the ground - state energy per lattice site versus frustration and cyclic exchange parameters . the dependence on the parameter @xmath51 is plotted in figure 8a ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the absolute value of the ground - state energy within scswt at first decreases with frustration , however , after a certain value of the frustration ratio it starts to increase .",
    "figure 8b ) presents the dependence of the ground - state energy on the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "the results show that @xmath67 decreases with the growth of the cyclic exchange parameter .      the model described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] )",
    "may be used to study the magnetic properties of the high - temperature superconductor parent compound @xmath2 .",
    "this compound has been the subject of our previous studies @xcite , where the calculation was performed within the method of spin green functions on the model without the cyclic exchange interaction .",
    "the model with the non - vanishing parameter @xmath52 within the scsw theory has been examined in detail in ref .",
    "the set of bare superexchange couplings quoted therein was determined by the accurate fit of the in - plane spin - wave dispersion from ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained by the inelastic neutron scattering at @xmath68 . since we had improved experimental data from ref .",
    "@xcite at our disposal , we recalculated the exchange parameters .",
    "the frustration parameter is taken to be as small as @xmath69 , according to @xcite , instead of the value @xmath70 from @xcite .",
    "the set of the exchange parameters is thus slightly changed and within the scsw theory reads : @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "if we use this set of parameters to obtain the spin - wave dispersion at @xmath74 , we obtain the spectrum which gives up to @xmath75 of the observed changes between the low- and high - temperature spectrum .",
    "this presents a mild improvement to the spectrum calculated from the parameters quoted in @xcite , since the later accounts only for a few percent of the observed changes .",
    "the three - dimensional tetragonal @xmath7 antiferromagnet presents an interesting system , studied in literature due to its application to layered copper oxides , which present the high - temperature superconducting parent compounds . in the present paper",
    "this system is described by the heisenberg hamiltonian comprising the planar interactions up to nnnn interaction , the cyclic exchange interaction , as well as the interplane interaction .",
    "the magnetic properties of the ground state of the model are examined within the framework of scsw theory and compared to the lswt predictions .",
    "we show that the system is highly frustrated and therefore subjected to the complex competition of different exchange interactions , leading to the specific magnetic properties behavior .",
    "the spin - wave spectra depend on frustration and cyclic exchange ratio , whereby the increase of these ratios yields the softening of the spectra .",
    "the sublattice magnetization dependence on the aforementioned parameters demonstrates that the zero - temperature quantum fluctuations play a pronounced role .",
    "the planar frustration and cyclic exchange have the opposite impact on the ground - state sublattice magnetization , whereby the former destabilizes , while the later stabilizes the system .",
    "the effect of the next - next - nearest neighbours interaction is shown to be significant , according to the fact that the critical value of the frustration ratio where afm order is destroyed is , within lswt for instance , three times smaller in the presence of the nnnn interaction .",
    "the influence of the interlayer coupling on the sublattice magnetization is also examined and turned out to be dictated by the exchange interaction competition . the spin - wave velocity renormalization factor and ground - state energy",
    "are strongly affected by the frustration and cyclic exchange interaction as well .",
    "the scsw theory is also applied to layered cuprate oxide @xmath2 .",
    "the set of exchange parameters in this compound is determined to fit the experimental spin - wave dispersion obtained at @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature spectrum is then calculated , showing better agreement with the experiment than the earlier ones , but still indicating to the limitations of the spin - wave theories at high temperatures .",
    "the aim of this study was to give an exhaustive research of the results which scsw theory gives for this model , as well as to point out its shortcomings , where some more sophisticated theories , as for example perturbative spin - wave expansion up to @xmath77 , have to be applied .",
    "we are grateful to s. hayden , r. coldea and g. aepply for sending us experimental data for the spin - wave dispersion in @xmath2 .",
