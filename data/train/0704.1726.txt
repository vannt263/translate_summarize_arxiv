    "in his attempt to explain the dual nature of matter as both wave and particle , de broglie proposed what is called as the theory of double solution @xcite .",
    "he was searching for a nonlinear type of wave equation which possesses a singular , spatially localized , nondispersive solution in region where the amplitude is sufficiently high .",
    "this spatial part of the global solution is then supposed to play the role of a particle . on the other hand , in region where the amplitude is weak , the solution is assumed to behave like a linear wave obeying the law of superposition .",
    "he thus envisioned a particle which is immersed in linear wave field and is guided by the latter .",
    "he argued that in order that each point of the singular solution to move non - dispersively , thus particle - like , the velocity of the singular solution must be equal to the velocity of the non - singular linear solution .",
    "this is de broglie s guiding principle @xcite which eventually led him to the famous relation between the momentum of a particle @xmath0 and the associated wave length @xmath1 of the guiding wave : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the corresponding wave number .",
    "the prevailing quantum theory is however founded on the schrdinger equation which is linear with respect to its ingredient , namely the wave function . in this theory , a single free particle",
    "is usually represented by a plane wave . yet , the successes of this representation seems to rely on the adoption of eq .",
    "( [ de broglie relation ] ) where @xmath4 is now the wave number of the plane wave , and the relation between the energy of the particle and the frequency of the plane wave , @xmath5 : @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one can even argue that those two relations are the most important principles of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "even the linear schrdinger equation can be derived from those relations .",
    "it is then apparently the linearity of the schrdinger equation which discourages people to keep searching for particle - like solution .",
    "the ambition to search for a particle - like solution is further overshadowed by the tremendous successes ( for all pragmatical purposes @xcite ) of the probability interpretation of wave function invented by born @xcite which is heavily based on the law of superposition .",
    "this law is possible only if the underlying equation is linear .",
    "this eventually led to the axiomatic development of quantum theory by dirac and von neumann @xcite .    despite of these facts , fueled by the dissatisfaction on the foundation of the axiomatic approach to quantum theory @xcite , and a simple fact from , say the single slit experiment which undeniably suggests that there is indeed a localized quantity which hits the screen thus giving a point of scintillation @xcite , some people are still searching for a quantum theory which assumes a localized particle - like solution .",
    "interestingly , this adventure is again led by de broglie after abandoning his own idea for many decades .",
    "much effort again is made to search for such a solution from a nonlinear wave equation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall show that even a linear schrdinger equation possesses a class of localized - nondispersive solution which interestingly shares the properties long conjectured by de broglie .",
    "this will be done by entertaining the hydrodynamics picture of the schrdinger equation developed by madelung @xcite .",
    "even more , we show that the soliton wave function is the limiting case of a class of the most probable wave functions given its quantum energy @xcite .",
    "we then show that the linearity of the schrdinger equation allows one to develop many solitons solution through superposition .",

    "[ rmax vs t ] that @xmath59 is approaching to a finite value , @xmath60 .",
    "this hints us that the quantum probability density and thus its corresponding quantum potential are also converging toward some functions @xmath61    to discuss this latter situation in more detail , let us go back to fig .",
    "[ small temperature vs qpd and qp]a .",
    "one can see that as @xmath29 decreases , the quantum potential inside the support is getting flatterer before becoming infinite at the boundary points , @xmath62 .",

    "namely @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is constant for @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . since @xmath48 is flat inside the support , then one has @xmath69 . hence , from the definition of quantum potential given in eq .",
    "( [ quantum potential ] ) , inside the support of the quantum probability density , one has @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the quantum amplitude at @xmath47 .",

    "( [ localized - stationary qpd ] ) .",
    "this confirms our initial guess that at @xmath47 the quantum potential takes a form of box with infinite wall at @xmath64 .",
    "let us remark that all the above results suggest that the wave function can generate its own boundary at which it is vanishing .",
    "this is a very important fact since then one can talk about a self - sustained geometrical property of the wave function",
    ". we shall show in the next section that this fact will help us in developing our notion of particle from the schrdinger wave function .",
    "one can of course trace back the emergence of this self - organized structure from the self - referential property of the madelung fluid dynamics .",
    "let us now choose a pair of fields @xmath79 as the initial state of the madelung fluid . here , @xmath80 is given in eq .",
    "( [ localized - stationary qpd ] ) and @xmath81 is a uniform velocity field with non - vanishing value only inside the spatial support @xmath82 $ ] . then , since at @xmath83 the quantum potential is flat inside the support , the quantum force is initially vanishing , @xmath84 such that @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the velocity field at infinitesimal lapse of time @xmath86 will stay unchanged and keeps uniform .",
    "this in turn will shift the quantum probability density in space by @xmath87 while keeps its profile unchanged .",
    "correspondingly , it will shift the support of the quantum probability density by the same amount .",
    "the same thing occurs for the next infinitesimal lapse of time and so on and so forth .",
    "one thus concludes that _ the quantum probability density is moving with a uniform velocity field @xmath88 , keeping its initial form remained unchanged_. hence , at time @xmath10 , the quantum probability density is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 $ ] .    to write the explicit form of the complex - valued self - trapped and uniformly - moving yet stationary wave function @xmath11 of our single particle , let us first calculate its quantum mechanical energy .",
    "since quantum mechanical energy is conserved then it is sufficient to use the wave function at @xmath83 .",
    "putting the wave function in polar form , @xmath92 , one has @xmath93 the first term on the right hand side is equal to the average quantum potential , @xmath94 .",
    "next , defining kinetic energy density as @xmath95 , then the second term is equal to the kinetic energy of the madelung fluid @xmath96 .",
    "further , for a uniform velocity field , the last term is vanishing , @xmath97 .",
    "for the same reason , since @xmath98 is an even function and @xmath99 is an odd function then the third term is also vanishing .    hence , in total , the quantum mechanical energy of the self - trapped wave function moving with a uniform velocity field @xmath88 can be decomposed as @xmath100 moreover , using similar argument as above , the average quantum momentum can also be calculated to give @xmath101 the average kinetic energy of the madelung fluid and average quantum momentum are thus related as @xmath102 .",
    "this observation leads us to conclude that @xmath103 must be interpreted as essentially an _ internal energy _ of the single particle .",
    "namely it is the energy when the particle is not moving .",
    "a similar notion is also developed in special relativity theory , dubbed as rest mass energy .",
    "one can also check that the internal energy is the energy which is missed to be taken into account if one uses the simple plane wave to represent a free moving particle .",
    "bearing in mind the above derived facts , let us write the moving - stationary pair of fields @xmath104 in complex - valued form , @xmath105 . to do this",
    ", one has to calculate the quantum phase @xmath14 by integrating @xmath106 to give @xmath107 , where @xmath108 depends only on time @xmath10 .",
    "the wave function we are searching thus takes the following form : @xmath109 . finally , putting this back into the schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger equation ] ) , keeping in mind @xmath110 and eq .",

    "the solitonic nature of the above wave function is obvious .",
    "let us proceed to discuss the stationary - moving soliton solution of the free particle schdinger equation that we just developed in the previous section .",
    "first , the wave function possesses only a finite range of support @xmath115 . using the fact that @xmath77 which came from the boundary condition for the quantum amplitude @xmath116 , and the expression for @xmath75 in term of quantum potential @xmath117 of eq .",
    "( [ wave number vs average quantum potential ] ) , one is led to the following relation between the width of the support of the soliton wave function and the quantum potential : @xmath118    on the other hand , we have shown in the previous section that @xmath119 is but the internal energy , namely the energy of the particle when it is not moving .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that this energy is equivalent to the rest mass energy predicted by the einstein s theory of special relativity .",
    "namely , one assumes that @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the velocity of light . putting this into eq .",
    "( [ width vs internal energy ] ) , one finally obtains @xmath122 where @xmath123 is but the compton wave length .",
    "one can thus conclude that the active region of the soliton wave function is proportional to the compton wave length of the particle .",
    "in particular , this active region is narrower for particle with larger mass .",
    "next , in fig . [ linear soliton ]",
    "we plot the snapshot of spatial profile of the real part of soliton wave function given in eq .",
    "( [ stationary - moving wave function final ] ) , @xmath124 , at times : @xmath125 .",
    "one observes an envelope given by @xmath126 which is moving uniformly with velocity @xmath88 .",
    "one can also see from eq .",
    "( [ stationary - moving wave function final ] ) , that there is _ internal spatial vibration _ whose wave number @xmath127 is determined by the average quantum momentum @xmath128 @xmath129 is then but the famous de broglie wave length .",
    "this is in fact what is expected by de broglie in his conjecture of double solution . yet in contrast to the theory of double solution which envisions a soliton solution emerging from a _ nonlinear _ wave equation , here we have shown a soliton wave function as a solution of _ linear _ schrdinger equation .    before proceeding to discuss further consequence of the linearity of the schrdinger equation ,",
    "let us evaluate what will happen if the internal vibration of de broglie s wave length resonates inside the self - generated quantum potential .",
    "namely one imposes that the length of the support of the quantum probability density , @xmath115 , is equal to the integer multiple of the de broglie s wave length @xmath130 .",

    "( [ stationary - moving wave function final ] ) will also satisfy the schrdinger equation_. for example , let us consider the following superposition of two solitons solution @xmath138 each soliton term on the right hand side moves with uniform velocity @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and possesses a finite support given by @xmath141 $ ] , where @xmath142 .",
    "the total support is then given by @xmath143 .",
    "one can then show that the above wave function satisfies the schrdinger equation of eq .",

    "let us consider the case when the sign of @xmath148 and @xmath149 are opposite to each other .",
    "first , at @xmath83 , one observes spatial interference pattern .",
    "hence , there is no way to distinguish one from the other .",
    "one thus must consider both as a single particle of mass @xmath7 with energy @xmath135 . yet , at sufficiently large time , the two solitons are spatially separated , thus no interference phenomena is seen .",
    "one can distinguish two spatially localized solitons corresponding to two particles .",
    "at this situation , it is easy to calculate the conserved quantum energy @xmath135 to have @xmath150 namely , it is given as the summation of the energy of each particle , @xmath144 .",
    "the theory then predicts an interesting phenomena in which a particle of a given mass @xmath7 can break into two particles with still equal mass @xmath7 yet possessing different energy .",
    "since the schrdinger equation is time reversal , then by reversing the time , one concludes that two particles with equal mass @xmath7 can merge into a particle of the same mass yet with energy given by the addition of the energy of the merging particles .",
    "one can of course extend the above two solitons solution to many solitons solution straightforwardly , each of which can be interpreted as describing a single particle of equal mass .",
    "moreover , each moves independently from the other thus the total energy is given by the summation of the energy of all the particles .",
    "hence , the schdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger equation ] ) which previously is thought of as a theory of a single free particle , now is re - interpreted as a theory of non - interacting many particles with the same masses .",
    "first , we have shown that the linear schrdinger equation for a single free particle possesses a class of soliton solution parameterized by the quantum energy and momentum .",
    "we showed that the soliton wave packet shares the properties that a quantum particle should have as envisioned by de broglie long time ago in the early days of quantum mechanics even before the birth of the schrdinger equation .",
    "namely , the soliton wave function possesses an internal vibration whose wave number @xmath127 is determined by the momentum of the particle @xmath136 exactly described by the famous de broglie s relation , @xmath151 .",
    "we then showed that assuming resonance of the internal vibration inside the quantum potential , the possible values of the momentum of the particle is discretized as the integer multiple of the wave number of the envelope soliton . a natural question",
    "then arises : when this quantization happens ? to answer this question",
    ", one can borrow conventional idea from the physics of classical wave . in this field ,",
    "a resonance usually is related to interaction and transfer of energy .",
    "we therefore expect that the quantization in soliton wave function happens if it interacts with other physical object .",

    "finally , we showed that the linearity of the schrdinger equation allows us to construct many solitons solution through the superposition principle .",
    "we argue that each term of the superposition can be interpreted as describing a single particle with the same mass as the other , yet each might possesses different momentum and energy .",
    "moreover , each particle is free to move independently from the other .",

    "it is then interesting to further ask : can we have a similar theory which possesses many solitons solution so that each can be associated to a particle with different masses ? to do this",
    "one can not start from a theory in which the mass is already fixed as in the schrdinger equation of eq .",
