    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) is realized in nature there should be two scalar particles ( sfermions ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 corresponding to the two chirality states of each fermion @xmath9 .",
    "the sfermions of the third generation play a special role as @xmath7 and @xmath8 may strongly mix ( proportionally to the fermion mass ) , forming the two mass eigenstates @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) . as a consequence one eigenstate ( @xmath10 )",
    "can have a much lower mass than the other one .",
    "sfermion pair production in @xmath13 collisions , @xmath14 , has been studied extensively phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "the strong interest in sfermion production is mainly due to the fact that it gives access to one of the fundamental susy breaking parameters @xmath15 , the trilinear coupling parameter .",
    "it is clear that in @xmath16 and @xmath17 gluon radiation and gluon exchange play an important role @xcite .",
    "the susy - qcd corrections to these processes due to gluino and squark exchange were calculated in @xcite and found to become effective at @xmath18 .",
    "yukawa corrections @xcite were shown to be non negligible either . very recently , while we were already working on the calculation of the full one - loop corrections to sfermion pair production within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , such a calculation was presented in @xcite . in this context , it is worthwhile to mention that the complete one - loop corrections to selectron and smuon pair production from threshold to high energies were calculated in @xcite.for the calculation of higher order corrections , renormalization of the mssm with an appropriate fixing of the susy parameters is necessary .",
    "essentially , two methods were proposed in the on - shell scheme , one in @xcite and the other one in @xcite for a review see @xcite .",
    "of course , both should lead to the same results for observables as masses , cross - sections , widths , etc .. the schemes differ in the fixing of the counterterms of some of the susy parameters as @xmath19 , etc .",
    "therefore the meaning of these parameters is different at loop level .",
    "however , at one - loop , in sfermion pair production this difference only matters in selectron pair production , @xmath20 , and sneutrino pair production , @xmath21 , due to the neutralino or chargino exchange being already present at tree level . here",
    "we fix the susy parameters entering the sfermion mass matrices in the corresponding sfermion sector so that one has not to take into account any shifts in these parameters at one - loop level . in our case , we also have a different fixing of the fine structure constant @xmath22 taking @xmath23 as input , in contrast to @xcite where the thomson limit is used according to @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we also present a full one - loop calculation within the mssm for @xmath24 .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained in @xcite . due to the complexity of such a calculation",
    ", an independent computation seems appropriate .",
    "we have calculated all graphs analytically and have written our own computer program for the numerical evaluation .",

    "the results presented in this paper come from a full analytic calculation where we have neglected the electron mass ( @xmath110 ) except for the qed corrections.in the case of this particular process , we can separate off the qed corrections on the basis of feynman diagrams in a gauge invariant way .",
    "the qed corrections consist of all the diagrams that have an additional photon added to the tree level and therefore also include the whole real corrections .",
    "the weak corrections are then uv and ir finite and @xmath109 independent .",
    "all numerical results show only the weak corrections as the qed part is very sensitive to @xmath109 .",
    "the numerical calculation was performed using the packages looptools and ff @xcite .",
    "the results were checked against the results for the yukawa approximation presented in @xcite where our results match except for a minus sign already pointed out in @xcite.furthermore , we did our own independent calculation based on feynarts and formcalc packages @xcite checking all individual feynman diagrams at the amplitude level . in addition , we used the packages to check the complete results using the same renormalization scheme as in the analytical calculation.we also compared our results with @xcite where we were able to reproduce all the results apart from minor differences due to the different renormalization of the fine structure constant .",
    "in the following numerical examples , we assume @xmath111 for the first , second and third generation soft susy breaking masses , and all trilinear couplings are set to a common value @xmath112 . for the standard model parameters we take @xmath113  gev , @xmath114  gev , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117  gev , and @xmath118  gev .",
    "@xmath119 is fixed by the gaugino unification relation @xmath120 , and the gluino mass is related to @xmath121 by @xmath122.below we show plots for three different scenarios . on the left , there are the total and tree - level cross - sections for all channels @xmath123 , and on the right we picked out one of the channels and show a separation into the convergent subclasses described in the text above.care has to be taken when comparing plots for different sfermions in the same scenario because we always fix the susy parameters ( @xmath124 etc . ) in the sector of the produced sfermions .",
    "one can see that the total corrections in squark production are dominated by susy - qcd where the biggest contribution comes from the gluon .",
    "the gluino part is small compared to the gluon one as already shown in @xcite . at higher energy ( @xmath125 ) ,",
    "other corrections can grow to a size comparable to the susy - qcd contribution .",
    "the leading weak contribution at high energy comes from the box diagrams . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sc1]-[sc3 ] , the box diagrams give a negative contribution rising with energy .",
    "this can be checked against the sudakov approximation at high energies @xcite , where the box contributions give the leading correction .",
    "the sum of the other two corrections , the vertex and the propagator corrections , is small compared to the box contribution.the weak corrections computed here have a significant effect in the high energy region , and in the case of squarks act against the susy - qcd corrections . for stau production they can go up to -10% in certain cases.in addition",
    ", we also show the tau - sneutrino production . for detection ,",
    "it is necessary that not only the decay channel to @xmath126 is open .",
    "our three scenarios allow decays into charginos .",
    "sneutrino production is the only case where not only the susy - qcd corrections are not present but also the yukawa corrections are small .",
    "this is due to the fact that the diagrams including a neutralino or a neutral higgs boson in the loop are missing ( in yukawa approximation ) .",
    "therefore , the sneutrino production shows a particular dominance of the box corrections . in fig .",
    "[ sne ] one sees that the tree level is almost identical in two of our scenarios due to the small difference in the sneutrino mass .",
    "the total cross - section in the two scenarios is also very similar as the different vertex corrections and the propagator corrections are together below 5% and the boxes give the leading contribution .",
    "we have calculated the complete one - loop corrections to stop , sbottom , stau and tau - sneutrino production .",
    "the calculation was performed in an analytical way with an independent check using the feynarts and formcalc computer packages @xcite .",
    "our way of fixing the fine structure constant @xmath22 gives a higher tree - level cross - section and therefore smaller radiative corrections compared to @xcite .",
    "the corrections are typically of 5 - 10% and thus not negligible at a future linear collider .",
