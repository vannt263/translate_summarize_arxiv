    "recently , invariant distributions for the gaps in a particle system on the real line have received much attention . in the continuous time setting such questions are motivated by the study of gaps in ordered brownian particle systems with rank - dependent drifts and diffusion coefficients .",
    "the latter arise in the modeling of the capital distribution in a financial market ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) and as heavy traffic approximations of queueing networks ( see section 5 of @xcite for the correspondence between the processes of gaps and reflected brownian motions and , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for the heavy traffic approximation of queueing networks by the latter ) . in the discrete time setting these questions appeared in the study of the sherrington  kirkpatrick model of spin glasses and were allowed to characterize the quasi - stationary states in the free energy model ( see @xcite for this result and @xcite for its extensions ) . in these papers",
    "the increments added to the particles in each time step were either assumed to be i.i.d . or normally distributed .",
    "the latter evolutions by gaussian increments can be viewed as a time discretized version of the brownian particle systems .",
    "the present paper studies the processes of gaps in finite and infinite particle systems on the real line and half - line evolving in continuous time and in which particles are driven by i.i.d . lvy processes with jumps . in the finite case the latter are endowed with rank - dependent drift and diffusion coefficients",
    ". we will refer to these evolutions as competing particle systems .",
    "more precisely , the competing particles are indexed by @xmath0 with @xmath1 in the case of finitely many particles and @xmath2 in the case of infinitely many particles .",
    "the evolution on the whole line will be referred to as the unregulated evolution and the evolution on the half - line @xmath3 for some barrier @xmath4 as the regulated evolution .",
    "the particle systems are defined as the unique weak solutions ( see section [ sec21 ] and proposition  [ prop3.1 ] for more details ) to the following stochastic differential equations : @xmath5\\\\[-8pt ] & & { } + dl_i(t ) + dr_i(t ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath0 where @xmath6 , @xmath0 in the unregulated case and @xmath7 @xmath0 in the regulated case . hereby , @xmath8 is the ordered vector of particles in which ties are broken according to an arbitrarily specified ordering of the initial configuration , @xmath9 is a collection of i.i.d .",
    "standard brownian motions , @xmath10 is an independent collection of i.i.d .",
    "pure jump lvy processes each making finitely many jumps on any finite time interval .",
    "for each @xmath0 and @xmath11 the term @xmath12 denotes the jump @xmath13 of the process @xmath14 at time @xmath15 and each @xmath16 is the local time process of @xmath17 at @xmath18 . to avoid any confusion we choose the same normalization of the local time processes as in @xcite and @xcite so that @xmath16 is one of the summands in the semi - martingale decomposition of the process @xmath19 rather than @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , we impose the initial conditions @xmath21 and @xmath22 and , in addition , @xmath23 in the regulated case . to distinguish between the two evolutions",
    "we denote the particle configuration at a time @xmath24 by @xmath25 in the unregulated particle system and by @xmath26 in the regulated particle system .",
    "heuristically , particle @xmath27 in the unregulated particle system is driven by a lvy process whose drift and diffusion coefficients change according to its rank in the particle system .",
    "the regulated particle system is defined similarly , except that whenever a particle hits the barrier @xmath18 or jumps over @xmath18 , it is reflected in the former case and it is placed at @xmath18 in the latter case .    to simplify the notation we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , for all @xmath0 .",
    "next , we can define the processes of gaps , which will be the main quantities of interest , by @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "for @xmath1 we can set @xmath32 and note that the properties of the gap process @xmath33 correspond to the properties of the mass partition @xmath34 @xmath35 and the analogous statement is true for the process @xmath36 .    in models for the capital distribution in a financial market the processes @xmath37 stand for the capitalizations of the different firms and the particles represent the logarithmic capitalizations of the firms .",
    "due to this interpretation , we will call the diffusion coefficients from now on volatilities or volatility coefficients of the particles . in this context",
    "it is natural to allow the particles to have jumps corresponding to such events as mergers of firms , shares emissions or jumps in the stock price . indeed , since merton s seminal paper @xcite and a vast number of works that followed , it is widely agreed that market models allowing for discontinuities in the stock price are able to better account for sudden large changes in the values of the stocks , the incompleteness of financial markets and the imperfectness of the hedging strategies for options when compared to models assuming continuous trajectories of the stock prices .",
    "hereby , models in which the jumps originate from pure jump lvy processes play a central role . for a recent summary of the research in this direction and a list of references",
    "we refer to the book @xcite .",
    "the models on the half - line describe markets in which either firms are bailed out if their capitalization falls below a certain predetermined barrier or in which capitalizations are constrained not to overcome a certain barrier , depending on the interpretation of the model . in the absence of jumps such models can be analyzed by exploiting their relation with semi - martingale reflected brownian motions in the sense of @xcite as was done in @xcite for the models on the whole line [ see the proof of lemma [ lemma2.1](b ) below for the connection ] . in @xcite",
    "the authors considered a related model for a market with two firms defaulting if their capitalization crosses a fixed threshold .",
    "they were able to determine how to split the total drift , representing the total amount of tax cuts or subsidies , between the two firms to maximize the probability that both of them survive .    the mass partitions above correspond in this context to the market weights of the ranked market participants .",
    "for this reason , all results on the gap processes in the finite particle systems translate directly into corresponding results on the processes of market weights .",
    "in particular , the invariant distributions , the existence and uniqueness of which we prove for the processes of gaps in the finite systems both on the line and on the half - line , stand for capital distributions among the ranked market participants which are not changing under the evolution . we also show that the gap processes converge to the respective unique invariant distributions in the total variation distance .",
    "this corresponds to the statement that the considered financial market approaches a stable capital allocation in a strong sense .",
    "in addition , under the invariant distributions for the gap processes , all gaps are finite by definition which implies that the limiting stable capital distributions are nondegenerate , in the sense that the market weights of all firms are positive almost surely .    in the context of stochastic queueing and storage networks ,",
    "our model is closely related to the so - called lvy networks which are described mathematically by lvy processes regulated to stay in an orthant by normal projections onto the boundary and normal reflections at the boundary ( see chapter ix of @xcite and the references therein for more details ) .",
    "in particular , the techniques we use to prove that the processes of gaps possess unique invariant distributions and converge to the latter can be used without alteration to show the same statements for an integrable lvy process with a nondegenerate brownian part , whose components are endowed with negative drifts and which is regulated to stay in an orthant , provided that its jumps are dominated by the drifts in an appropriate sense . the convergence in total variation of the process",
    "to its invariant distribution proves the stability of the corresponding queueing network , meaning that the joint law of the workload processes converges in the strong sense .    throughout the paper",
    "we make the following assumptions .",
    "[ assump1.1 ] ( a ) in all cases we assume that the volatilities @xmath38 are positive and it holds that @xmath39<\\infty,\\qquad { \\mathbb e}[l_i(t)]=0,\\qquad i\\in i.\\ ] ]    \\(b ) if @xmath2 , the drifts and volatilities are assumed to satisfy @xmath40 for some @xmath41 in the unregulated case and , in addition , @xmath42 in the regulated case .    our results for the systems with",
    "finitely many particles are summarized in the following two theorems .",
    "[ theo1.2 ] if @xmath1 and @xmath43 satisfies @xmath44<\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot \\min ( \\delta_1-\\delta_2,\\ldots,\\delta_{n-1}-\\delta_n),\\ ] ] then the gap process @xmath45 of the unregulated particle system has a unique invariant distribution .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath43 satisfies @xmath46<\\frac { 1}{n}\\cdot\\min(-\\delta_1,\\delta_1-\\delta_2,\\ldots,\\delta _ { n-1}-\\delta_n),\\ ] ] then the gap process @xmath47 of the regulated particle system has a unique invariant distribution .",
    "[ theo1.3 ] if @xmath1 and condition ( [ cond1 ] ) holds , then the process @xmath33",
    ", @xmath24 converges in total variation to its unique invariant distribution .",
    "if @xmath1 and condition ( [ cond2 ] ) holds , then the same statement is true for the process @xmath36 , @xmath24 .",
    "we remark that in the absence of jumps , condition ( [ cond1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , the latter is stronger than condition ( 3.2 ) of @xcite ( used there to establish the existence and uniqueness of an invariant distribution for the gap process of the finite unregulated system without jumps ) which in our notation reads @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that one can not expect the conditions in theorems [ theo1.2 ] and [ theo1.3 ] to be sharp in general .    for the infinite regulated system",
    "we show the following proposition .",
    "[ prop1.4 ] if @xmath2 and @xmath51<-\\delta_1,\\ ] ] then the family @xmath36 , @xmath24 is tight on @xmath52 equipped with the product topology for any initial condition in @xmath53    the proof of proposition [ prop1.4 ] relies heavily on the fact that under assumption  [ assump1.1 ] , the evolution of each particle in the infinite regulated system is given by a lvy process with negative drift regulated to stay on @xmath3 .",
    "for this reason it does not carry over to the setting of the infinite unregulated system . at this point we also note that in the special case of the infinite regulated system with equal drifts @xmath54 equal volatilities @xmath55 and no jumps , the processes @xmath56 are independent reflected brownian motions on @xmath57 . due to the negativity of the drifts",
    "this implies that for each @xmath0 the process @xmath56 converges in law to an exponential random variable .",
    "moreover , a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "exponential random variables is almost surely dense in @xmath57 by the second borel ",
    "cantelli lemma .",
    "this shows that , in general , one can not expect the infinite regulated system to have an invariant distribution , since already in the described special case the number of particles on each nonempty interval of the form @xmath58 will tend to infinity for any initial particle configuration .",
    "in contrast to this , in @xcite the authors show the existence of an infinite family of invariant distributions for the gap process in the corresponding particle system on the whole line . in the more general case of nonconstant drifts or volatilities",
    "the questions of existence and uniqueness of invariant distributions for the gap process of the infinite regulated system and of the convergence of the latter to an invariant distribution are open .",
    "the approach used in the analysis of the finite systems may apply to this case as well .",
    "however , one has to establish the recurrence and irreducibility structure of the gap process in an infinite - dimensional space where the analysis of the corresponding reflected brownian motion is more intricate .",
    "in @xcite the authors treat the infinite unregulated system without jumps with the drift sequence @xmath59 and a constant and positive volatility sequence @xmath60 and are able to find an invariant distribution for the gap process on a subset of @xmath61 . in @xcite",
    "the authors characterize all invariant distributions for the process of gaps in the case of constant drift and volatility sequences . as in the regulated case",
    "the questions of existence and uniqueness of invariant distributions and of the convergence of the gap process to the latter for a general drift or volatility sequence are open .",
    "the main obstacle hereby is the same as in the case of the infinite regulated system ( see the end of the previous paragraph ) .",
    "it is a natural question to ask to provide an explicit description of the invariant distributions in theorem [ theo1.2 ] in the presence of jumps .",
    "however , even in the case of the regulated particle system with a single particle , where the gap process is a one - dimensional lvy process regulated to stay nonnegative , the invariant distribution is not known explicitly . to the best of our knowledge the most explicit result in this direction is obtained in @xcite , section 3 . there , in the described special case with the additional assumption that the magnitude of the negative jumps of the driving lvy process is exponentially distributed , an expression for the fourier transform of the invariant distribution is given in terms of the characteristic exponent of the driving lvy process and the expected accumulated local time of the gap process at zero over a unit time interval when the initial value of the gap process is chosen according to the unique invariant distribution ( see @xcite , equation ( 3.11 ) ) .",
    "a completely explicit description of the invariant distribution for the gap process , even for specific examples of a regulated or an unregulated system with multiple particles in which jumps are present , seems to be out of reach at the moment .",
    "previous papers on brownian systems with rank - dependent drifts and volatilities use extensively the results of @xcite on reflected brownian motions and classical results on constrained diffusion processes to obtain the existence and uniqueness of the invariant distribution and the convergence of the gap process to the latter . due to the presence of jumps",
    ", these tools do not apply here and are replaced by more general techniques from the ergodic theory of harris recurrent markov processes , as in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , to obtain the results of theorems [ theo1.2 ] and  [ theo1.3 ] , we first find the dynamics of the gap processes in lemma [ lemma2.1 ] below .",
    "we use it subsequently to prove the tightness of the processes of gaps by dominating each of them by an appropriate harris recurrent markov process .",
    "next , we show the feller property for the gap processes to establish the existence of the invariant distributions for the latter . finally , to prove the uniqueness of the invariant distributions and the convergence of the processes of gaps , we employ the general theory of harris recurrent markov processes .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we treat the particle systems with finitely many particles .",
    "we show first their existence and explain some of their properties in section [ sec21 ] and then prove theorems [ theo1.2 ] and [ theo1.3 ] in section  [ sec22 ] .",
    "section [ sec3 ] deals with systems of infinitely many particles .",
    "we show that the latter exist and are well defined for appropriate initial conditions in section [ sec31 ] and prove proposition [ prop1.4 ] in section [ sec32 ] .",
    "throughout this section we deal with the two evolutions of finitely many particles , that is , we set @xmath1 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the unregulated version of ( [ sde1 ] ) can then be seen as follows . as remarked in section 2 of @xcite ,",
    "the main result of @xcite implies that for any @xmath62 with @xmath63 there exists a unique weak solution to @xmath64 defined on some probability space @xmath65 .",
    "next , let @xmath66 , @xmath67 , be copies of @xmath65 such that on each of them a process @xmath68 of the same law as @xmath69 is defined",
    ". moreover , let @xmath70 be the probability space on which the processes @xmath71 are defined .",
    "then a weak solution to ( [ sde1 ] ) can be defined on the product space @xmath72 denoting by @xmath73 the jump times of the @xmath74-valued process @xmath75 we set @xmath76 where we have used the notation @xmath77 .",
    "this gives a weak solution to the unregulated version of ( [ sde1 ] ) by construction .",
    "noting that for any other weak solution the joint distribution of its continuous part , its jump times and its jump sizes have to coincide with the corresponding quantity of the solution just constructed , we conclude that the weak solution is unique . here",
    "we have used the uniqueness of the weak solution to ( [ sdec1 ] ) , ( [ sdec2 ] ) .",
    "the regulated process @xmath78 can be constructed on the same probability space as @xmath79 as follows .",
    "we start with the desired initial value @xmath80 and set @xmath81 for all @xmath35 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , is the local time at @xmath18 of the process @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "we remark that this is precisely the construction of @xmath79 with the regulation and reflection at the barrier being added at the appropriate random times . due to the definition of the processes @xmath68 and of the involved local time processes ,",
    "@xmath78 and the corresponding process of regulations solve the regulated system ( [ sde1 ] ) , ( [ sde2 ] ) .",

    "the contribution of the terms @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the respective dynamics can be understood as follows .",
    "the contribution is nonzero if and only if one of the particles jumps and this jump changes the ranks of the particles .",
    "if this jump does not change the left - most particle in the unregulated system or does not involve a regulation in the regulated system , then these terms correspond to consecutive normal reflections of the process of gaps at faces of @xmath113 or @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "more precisely , the gap process is normally reflected at the faces @xmath114 , if the inequalities @xmath115 are violated by the jump and at the faces @xmath116 , if the inequalities @xmath117 are violated by the jump .",
    "if the jump changes the left - most particle in the unregulated system , then the particles are relabeled and this term gives the change of the gaps due to relabeling .",
    "if a particle jumps below the barrier in the regulated evolution , then the particle configuration is regulated and the particles are relabeled .",

    "indeed , the jump times of @xmath126 and @xmath127 coincide and the law of @xmath128 conditional on @xmath129 is the same as the law of @xmath130 conditional on @xmath131 .",
    "next , we recall that @xmath132 , @xmath133 were defined by @xmath77 and as the jump times of the process @xmath127 for @xmath134 .",
    "since @xmath135 coincides with the corresponding process in the absence of jumps for @xmath136 and any @xmath134 by its construction , it remains to verify that @xmath137 coincides with the jump given by the right - hand side of the equation in part ( a ) of the lemma for all @xmath50 and @xmath138 .",

    "but in view of the representation ( [ repr ] ) , this can be shown by using induction over the unique value of @xmath251 for which @xmath252 and the feller property of @xmath253 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath24 we have @xmath254 where the limits are taken in the weak sense .",
