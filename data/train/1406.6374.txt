    "the dynamically broken global symmetry to ensure the massless ng boson is explicitly but weakly broken by couplings between the fermions in the standard model and operators in the dynamical sector in addition to the gauge interactions in the standard model .",
    "the coupling induces mixings between the elementary fermions and composite hadronic states in the dynamical sector , and the yukawa interactions as well as the higgs potential are generated through the mixing .",
    "the top quark should give the most important contribution to the higgs potential since its yukawa coupling is the largest .",

    "the tev scale new physics motivated by the origin of the higgs boson also provides a natural explanation of dark matter of the universe as thermal relic of a stable tev or weak scale particle .",
    "if there is such a particle in the scenario of the pseudo nambu - goldstone higgs , one should also consider the contribution to the higgs potential from the dark matter particle .",
    "interestingly , such a contribution is somewhat needed to generate a realistic potential .",
    "the constraints from the electroweak precision measurements prefer to have a little hierarchy between the scale of dynamical symmetry breaking , @xmath7 , and the electroweak vev , @xmath8 , so that the standard model is realized as a good low energy effective theory .",
    "if a single source of the potential is dominated such as from the top quark , the naive expectation of the higgs vev is zero or of the order of @xmath9 due to the periodicity of the higgs potential . both are clearly not acceptable .",
    "a little hierarchy can be accommodated by assuming a cancellation in the leading contribution so that the subleading one becomes important .",
    "the presence of the dark matter particle provides another possibility .",
    "the higgs potential is destabilized at the origin by the contribution from the top quark , and stabilized at a small value @xmath8 by that from the dark matter particle .",

    ", we consider the @xmath10 model for the nambu - goldstone higgs field  @xcite , and introduce a gauge singlet majorana fermion as the dark matter particle which couples to the strong sector in a way that @xmath11 symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "the dark matter generates the higgs potential of the @xmath12 type at the leading order of the coupling .",
    "this contribution can balance against the @xmath13 type potential generated from the top quark .",
    "we find that in the parameter region where the correct size of the higgs potential is generated , the dark matter abundance is explained simultaneously through the induced coupling between dark matter and the higgs field .",
    "the predicted spin - independent cross sections for the direct detection experiments are found to be consistent with the current experimental bounds , but are large enough to be covered by the future experiments .",

    "the first and the second terms are the leading and sub - leading contributions in terms of the expansion with the coupling constants of the interaction terms between the top quark and the dynamical sector .",
    "these couplings break the @xmath11 symmetry explicitly since the top and bottom quarks do not fill the complete multiplet of @xmath11 .",

    "phenomenologically , one needs @xmath57 to satisfy experimental constraints , especially from the @xmath58 coupling  @xcite , which means @xmath59 .    in the following we consider the possibility that @xmath60 as expected from the perturbative expansion , but a large @xmath61 term necessary for the electroweak symmetry breaking is supplied by the contribution from the dark matter particle .    the models in which sm fermions couple to operators in the fundamental , * 5 * , or the antisymmetric , * 10 * representation have also been proposed  @xcite and reported that such models relax the constraints from the @xmath58 coupling , @xmath62 .",

    "this may be telling us that the nature of dark matter and that of the higgs boson are tightly related .",
    "we consider the possibility that dark matter is the one which is responsible for creating the potential of the higgs field .",

    "the higgs field is already introduced as effective degrees of freedom , and we assume that the dark matter particle couples to it through some interaction term to break the global symmetry . in a full dynamical description ,",
    "however , the picture may be more dramatic ; the higgs field may actually be the condensation of dark matter .",
    "for example , it has been studied recently that the scenario of the top quark condensation can have a picture of the pseudo nambu - goldstone higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "it is promising that the realization of the dark - matter condensation as the higgs field is also possible .    in the parameter region where the higgs boson mass and the abundance of the dark matter is explained ,",

    "<S> in a class of theories where the higgs field emerges as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , it is often assumed that interactions to generate the top yukawa coupling provide the higgs potential as well . </S>",
    "<S> such a scenario generically requires a little cancellation in the leading contribution to the higgs potential , and the electroweak scale is generated by the balance between the leading and the subleading contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we , instead , consider the possibility that the contribution from the dark matter particle balances against that from the top quark . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal relic of the new particle explains the abundance of dark matter in a consistent region of the parameter space , and the direct detection is found to be promising .    </S>",
