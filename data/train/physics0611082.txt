    "this is basically due to the facts that analytical reductions of the problem should e.g. make some restrictions on the asymptotic behavior of the electric field whereas numerical and experimental investigations should be obviously taken with great care when addressing the @xmath54 limit .",

    "we shall consider here the single wave - particle interaction model that describes the effective ( field envelope ) dynamics of the vlasov - poisson system in the case where only one wave exists .",
    "this is obviously an idealized or academic situation , yet it is perfectly appropriate to discuss oneil s picture .",

    "it is necessary to exclude the case of a cold beam . in this latter case , even if the initial wave amplitude is infinitesimal , it will not be completely damped : this signals the singular character of the cold beam / wave interaction .",

    " la oneil _ presented here rules out the classical research case of landau damping in the limit of a perturbative wave of infinitesimal amplitude .",
    "the present framework is definitely non trivial since , if the wave is effectively damped asymptotically to zero , nonlinear effects should place the study in the frame of isichenko s resolution @xcite predicting a very slow , asymptotically algebraic , damping .",

    "recently a pending debate emerged concerning the time - asymptotic state of a large amplitude landau damped wave @xcite .",
    "it is commonly expected that the system will eventually enter some stationary bgk equilibrium with a time - asymptotic finite wave amplitude provided the initial amplitude is large enough .",

    "the existence of bgk steady states is supported by some theoretical analysis and numerical results manfredi97,lancellottidorning , brunetti2000 . however , brodin s numerical simulations @xcite suggested that the wave amplitude never settles to a steady value as the energy of the resonant particles diffuses slowly into higher harmonics .",
    "moreover isichenko @xcite argued that nonlinearities should not stop the damping of the electric field towards a vanishing time - asymptotic amplitude .",
    "our point of view here is that , within the weak coupling hypothesis - that besides fully justifies the linear response of the background plasma - , the landau damping of a _ spectrum of waves _ is predicted _ not to reach _ a bgk finite amplitude steady state with the resonant tail electrons drifting with wave energy towards plasma bulk .",
