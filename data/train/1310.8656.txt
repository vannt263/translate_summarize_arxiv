    "strong interactions present some of the most interesting open issues within the standard model of particle physics .",
    "quarks and gluons , the elementary colored degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , appear to be confined in ordinary matter , due to a mechanism of color confinement which is not yet fully understood . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical arguments  @xcite and lattice qcd simulations predict the emergence of new phases , in which quarks and gluons are deconfined , when strongly interacting matter is put under extreme conditions , characterized by a high temperature @xmath3 and/or a high baryon density .",
    "a strongly interacting plasma of quarks and gluons ( qgp ) , in particular , is the new state of matter which is thought to have filled our universe in its early stages , and which is hunted for by experiments exploiting ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we are interested here in the properties of this new `` material '' , and of strongly interacting matter more in general , when it is placed in the presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the issue is fundamental , both theoretically and phenomenologically , since in some heavy ion collisions one has the highest magnetic fields ever created in a laboratory  @xcite , reaching up to @xmath4 tesla ( i.e. @xmath5 of @xmath6 gev@xmath2 ) , and even larger fields may have been created in the early stages of the universe  @xcite .",
    "that justifies the recent theoretical investigations on the subject ( for comprehensive reviews on various topics , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the non - perturbative regime of the theory",
    ", this problem can be conveniently approached by lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "the question regards , in particular , the dependence of the free energy density on a background field @xmath7 , which contains information on the equation of state as a function of @xmath7 and reveals whether the system is diamagnetic or paramagnetic .",
    "the issue is well posed and has been approached by a number of analytic  @xcite and recent lattice studies  @xcite . in a typical lattice setup , the need for magnetic flux quantization introduces a few technical difficulties when one tries to compute the derivatives of the free energy density with respect to @xmath7 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed to overcome such difficulties by determining free energy finite differences , in place of its derivatives , and we have applied this method to the determination of the magnetic susceptibility for @xmath8 qcd , in the standard rooted staggered discretization , with pion masses going down to 200  mev .",
    "results have provided evidence for a weak magnetic activity in the confined phase and for the emergence of strong paramagnetism in the deconfined , quark - gluon plasma phase ; such evidence has been confirmed by refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to improve on our original determination in several aspects .",
    "first of all , we investigate @xmath0 qcd with physical quark masses and three different lattice spacings , in order to check for discretization effects . in this way",
    ", we get control over the two major sources of systematic error and provide information which is of direct phenomenological relevance .",
    "second , we will extend the range of temperatures and try to better resolve the region around deconfinement , in order to understand if paramagnetism , or diamagnetism instead , takes place below @xmath9 , and to obtain more information about the high-@xmath3 behavior of the susceptibility .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we review the method adopted to determine the renormalized free energy density as a function of the background field . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we illustrate the lattice discretization and the numerical setup adopted . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present and discuss our results . finally , in section  [ summary ]",
    ", we draw our conclusions and discuss future perspectives .",
    "the main focus of our study is on the dependence of the free energy density @xmath10 of qcd on an external constant and uniform magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "usually , the dependence is given in terms of the derivatives of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath7 , like the magnetization ( first derivative ) or the susceptibility ( second derivative ) , which are more easily measureable quantities .",
    "however , in a lattice setup , taking such derivatives is not trivial , due to field quantization .    indeed , in order to minimize finite size effects , one usually works on a compact manifold , like a 3d torus .",
    "consistency conditions then require that the magnetic field flux through each closed surface either vanish or be quantized in units of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the elementary electric charge of the particles which populate the system . in the case of quarks ( @xmath14 ) moving in a uniform field @xmath15 on a 3d torus one",
    "has  @xcite @xmath16 are the torus extensions in the @xmath17 directions and @xmath18 must take integer values .",
    "a few approaches have been devised to get around this problem . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath7-dependent part of the free energy density has been related to the pressure anisotropy , whose determination requires the knowledge of some perturbative coefficients . in ref .",
    "@xcite the lattice torus has been divided in two identical regions where the magnetic field takes uniform but opposite values , thus ensuring an overall zero magnetic flux without any need for quantization .",
    "that allows to take @xmath7-derivatives as usual , even if at the price of introducing interface effects at the boundary between the two regions , which are expected to be negligible in the large volume limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead , we have developed a method which allows to compute the @xmath7-dependent part of @xmath10 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the partition function of the system and @xmath21 is the spatial volume . as it usually happens when trying to evaluate the ratio of two partition functions  @xcite",
    ", the method is computationally demanding , however it is well defined and feasible .",
    "the idea  @xcite is to obtain the finite free energy differences @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are integers , by integrating the derivative of a suitable extension of the function @xmath25 to real values of @xmath18 , @xmath26 the operation is well defined as long as the interpolating function @xmath25 is continuous and differentiable , and reduces the problem of determining the ratio of two partition functions to a determination of a standard observable , @xmath27 .",
    "it must be stressed that this observable has no direct relation with the magnetization of the original theory , even for integer values of @xmath18 , since it is just the derivative of the interpolating function .    in practice",
    ", @xmath25 can correspond to any distribution of magnetic field which interpolates between quantized values . in our realization",
    ", the magnetic field will be uniform over the whole lattice apart from a single plaquette , pierced by a sort of dirac string which brings the excess flux away ( see the next section for its explicit form ) .",
    "of course the final result , @xmath28 , is interpolation independent ; that has been also numerically verified in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "once @xmath29 has been determined , one must take care of getting rid of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences , since they contain @xmath7-dependent contributions which do not cancel when taking the difference @xmath29 , and must be properly subtracted . since we are interested in the magnetic properties of the thermal medium , the most natural prescription is to subtract vacuum ( i.e. @xmath30 ) contributions  @xcite : @xmath31 where it is assumed that both terms on the right hand side are computed at the same value of the uv cutoff ( lattice spacing ) .",
    "no further divergences are present in eq .",
    "( [ subtr ] ) , since @xmath7-dependent divergences can not depend also on @xmath3 , apart from possible finite terms which vanish in the continuum limit ( see , e.g. , the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the small field behavior of @xmath32 will give access to the magnetic susceptibility of the medium .",
    "indeed , once vacuum contributions have been subtracted , one has the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the magnetization of medium . assuming that the medium is linear , homogeneous and isotropic , one has @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the magnetic susceptibility in si units , so that @xmath37    the field @xmath11 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ intfree2 ] ) is the total field acting on the medium . in our numerical setup ,",
    "the dynamics of electromagnetic fields will be quenched , so that there is no backreaction from the medium itself , i.e. the magnetization @xmath34 does not change the value of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , @xmath11 coincides with the applied external field . while that does not introduce any systematic uncertainty in the determination of @xmath36 , which is the physical quantity that we will determine",
    ", one should consider that the actual change in the free energy density of a real medium , i.e. capable of producing magnetic fields by itself , will be different . indeed , if we introduce the auxiliary field @xmath38 , which is generated by external currents only , then @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the other standard definition of magnetic susceptibility , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "a simple comparison of the two expressions shows that the backreaction of the medium leads to a change of @xmath32 by a factor @xmath43 .",
    "however , considering the typical values of @xmath36 that we will show in section  [ results ] ( @xmath44 ) , this correction turns out to be negligible .    in the following",
    "it will be convenient to express @xmath32 also in the alternative form @xmath45 which is particularly useful when working in natural units .",
    "in this section we discuss our numerical setup for the discretization of @xmath46 quark flavors in the presence of an external magnetic field , with isospin symmetry broken only by the different electric charges .",

    "that could explain , in particular , the suppression of error bars in the low temperature region , where the parametrization is exponentially suppressed , while we do not expect such effect to be significant in the high temperature region . + let us discuss now the effect of the magnetic field on the equation of state of the system .",

    "[ compare_hrg ] , we compare , for a couple of values of @xmath7 , @xmath162 , computed from our continuum extrapolated susceptibility , with the ( all orders ) hrg prediction for the same quantity , after subtraction of vacuum contributions , extracted from the results reported in ref .",
    "a few differences are clearly visible .",
    "the hrg model predicts a slightly diamagnetic behavior for low enough @xmath3 , where the contribution from pions , which is indeed diamagnetic , dominates : notice that this behavior of the hrg free energy , which was not underlined by previous literature on the model , regards only the thermal contribution , i.e. after subtracting vacuum contributions to the free energy . for larger temperatures or fields , instead , the contribution of higher spin hadrons becomes overwhelming and the free energy behavior becomes paramagnetic .",
    "lattice results do not confirm this possible weak diamagnetic behavior for small temperatures and fields , even if , for @xmath163 mev , the possibility is still open , within present statistical uncertainties .    . ]",
    "we have investigated the magnetic properties of strongly interacting matter at thermal equilibrium .",
    "the study has been based on a lattice discretization of @xmath0 qcd with physical quark masses : we have considered 3 different values of the lattice spacing and verified the absence of significant discretization effects .",
    "we have exploited the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on a direct computation of the free energy density as a function of a uniform external magnetic background .",
    "we confirm that the strongly interacting medium is paramagnetic , both below and above the deconfinement transition , with a magnetic susceptibility whose order of magnitude is comparable , within the explored range of temperatures , with those of well known strong paramagnetic materials , like liquid oxygen .",
    "moreover , data for the free energy density show that strongly interacting matter behaves like a medium with a linear response , at least for magnetic fields up to @xmath112 gev@xmath2 , which is the order of magnitude of the typical fields produced in non - central heavy ion collisions at the lhc ; we stress that this behavior is non trivial , since such fields can not be considered as small , when compared to the typical qcd scale ( @xmath164 gev@xmath165 ) .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is relatively smaller in the confined phase , and compatible with zero within present errors for temperatures @xmath166 mev .",
    "it steeply rises across the deconfinement transition , while in the high @xmath3 regime present data , which go up to @xmath167 mev , are compatible with a diverging logarithmic behavior , which is predicted by a 1-loop calculation of the free energy density .",
    "notice that the weak diamagnetism , which would be expected at low temperatures and fields based on a pion gas approximation , and which is indeed predicted by hrg computations  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is not confirmed by lattice data , even if present uncertainties still leave room for it for @xmath163 mev .",
    "it would be interesting , in the future , to further investigate this issue .",
    "when compared to the pressure of the standard thermal medium , one sees that the introduction of an external magnetic field leads to a relative pressure increase which rapidly converges to zero in the high-@xmath3 phase , while instead it gets larger around the phase transition , where it is in the range 10 - 40% for @xmath5 0.1 - 0.2 gev@xmath2 , i.e. for the typical fields produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "such contribution becomes rapidly larger and of @xmath168 as the magnetic field increases , so that models for the cosmological qcd phase transition should necessarily take it into account .",
    "we have computed the contributions to the magnetic susceptibility coming from the different flavors : the @xmath169 contribution is approximately @xmath170 of the @xmath171 contribution , as expected on a charge counting basis , over the whole range of explored temperatures ; the @xmath172 contribution is slightly smaller than the one of the @xmath169 flavor , but tends to approach it in the high-@xmath3 limit .",
    "future studies , apart from extending the range of explored temperatures and from increasing the precision of data in the low-@xmath3 regime , should consider the effects of the inclusion of the @xmath119 quark , whose contribution , especially in the high-@xmath3 region , could be comparable to those from the @xmath172 and @xmath169 quarks , since the thermal suppression factor , due to the higher quark mass , should be partially compensated by the electric charge factor .",
    "considering the effects of the inclusion of a baryon chemical potential might be interesting as well .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that , while present results provide evidence that strongly interacting matter behaves like a medium with a linear response for magnetic fields up to @xmath173 0.1 gev@xmath2 , non - linear corrections could be important for larger fields , which may be of cosmological interest .",
    "our method permits to reconstruct the full dependence of the free energy density on @xmath7 in a straightforward way : while the present study was restricted on purpose to the linear response region , in order to extract the magnetic susceptibility , we plan in the future to extend our analysis to larger fields , so as to determine the non - linear contributions too .",
