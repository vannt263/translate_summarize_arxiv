    "photonic crystals are artificial low - loss dielectric structures with periodic modulation of refractive index , which have attracted considerable attention in the last two decades . due to bragg reflection",
    ", electromagnetic ( optical ) waves can not propagate through such structures in certain directions , at certain frequencies .",
    "hence , photonic crystals can control the propagation of electromagnetic waves in novel ways , with obvious application to dielectric mirrors , dielectric waveguides , and dielectric laser cavities .    as a way to efficiently inject light into a photonic crystal ( pc ) waveguide",
    ", it has recently been proposed to use surface electromagnetic waves ( sew)@xcite . in those papers , the photonic crystal was a two dimensional array of rods , of infinite length normal to the plane of incidence .",
    "instead , we have studied sew on a semi - infinite one - dimensional ( 1d ) photonic crystal sketched in fig .",
    "while retaining all useful properties of 2d and 3d photonic crystals , a 1d dielectric periodic structure with high refractive index contrast is more attractive from a technological point of view",
    ".    the usual theoretical methods for wave propagation in 1d photonic crystals , including sew , are the floquet - bloch modal formalism , coupled wave theory , and the transfer matrix method . among these three ,",
    "the coupled wave approach@xcite offers superior physical insight and gives simple analytical results in limiting cases .",
    "unfortunately , the conventional coupled wave theory of kogelnik fails in the case of high refractive index contrast , which is essential for a functional 1d photonic crystal .    in this paper",
    ", we apply our recently developed semiclassical version of coupled wave theory@xcite to sew on 1d photonic crystals .",
    "the method is analytically almost as simple as conventional coupled wave theory , and is practically exact for the achievable ratios ( e.g. 1.5:4.6 ) of the indices of refraction of the materials available to build devices .",
    "we present here a unified description of te and tm sew . a detailed account of the properties of the te surface modes has recently been given by us in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we complement these findings with those for tm modes , which are slightly more complex due to the presence of brewster points in the bandgaps . as a result , we thoroughly clarify the systematics of solutions for surface em waves in semi - infinite 1d photonic crystals .",
    "our method is formally quite different from that recently presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , or those in ref .",
    "@xcite , so in section ii we provide a short summary of the transfer matrix approach , in the notation of our previous work@xcite . in section",
    "iii we rederive the exact equations for sew of tm modes and obtain from them various analytic approximations for a semi - infinite crystal .",
    "the analogous equations for te modes were given in ref .",
    "@xcite . with these in hand , we discuss systematics of sew . in section",
    "iv we apply the semiclassical approximations of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite to surface waves , and show that the second approximation is very accurate both for the dispersion relation and the bandgap boundaries .",
    "we wish to describe surface states that form at the interface between a medium of low refractive index , @xmath0 , and a semi - infinite 1-d photonic crystal with layers of refractive indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 and thicknesses @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we choose a coordinate system in which the layers have normal vector along oz . as shown in fig .",
    "[ dsfig01 ] , the crystal is capped by a layer of the same material but different width , @xmath5 . for convenience of presentation , we split this termination layer of index of refraction @xmath1 and width @xmath5 into two sublayers , of lengths @xmath6 .",
    "the first sublayer extends from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "then the periodic array that forms the 1d photonic crystal consists of `` cells '' each made of three uniform layers of widths @xmath9 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 whose respective indices of refraction are @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "( if @xmath11 , the unit cell will have reflection symmetry , which simplifies some relations , but does not change any physical results . ) the first cell , given index @xmath12 , ranges from @xmath8 to @xmath13 ; the second is given index @xmath14 , and ranges from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , etc .",
    "the p - th cell runs from @xmath17 to @xmath18 and has @xmath19 when @xmath20 or @xmath21 and @xmath22 when @xmath23 .",
    "we choose @xmath24 .    for monochromatic te waves the electric field is parallel to the oy axis .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we write @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angular frequency , @xmath27 . is the vacuum wavenumber and @xmath28 is the ( constant ) @xmath29-component of the wavevector of modulus @xmath30 . for an electromagnetic wave entering the 1d photonic crystal from a uniform medium",
    ", one has @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the angle of incidence measured from the normal . for monochromatic tm waves it is the magnetic field which lies parallel to the oy axis .",
