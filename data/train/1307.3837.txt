    "the problem of analyzing the response of a nonlinear lattice to a localized disturbance arises in many applications , such as the study of stress waves in granular media after an impact @xcite , the excitation of nonlinear oscillations in crystals by atom bombardment @xcite , or the response of nonlinear transmission lines to a voltage pulse @xcite .",
    "several important dynamical phenomena can be captured by the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) model @xcite consisting of a chain of particles coupled by a pairwise interaction potential @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamical equations for a spatially homogeneous fpu chain read @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the displacement of the @xmath6th particle from a reference position .",
    "system ( [ nc ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the relative displacements @xmath7 and particle velocities @xmath8 as follows @xmath9 the dynamical evolution of localized solutions of ( [ ncrelham ] ) is strongly influenced by the properties of the interaction potential @xmath3 . in its most general form ,",
    "the interaction potential satisfies @xmath10 where @xmath0 and @xmath11 .    in the work @xcite , the dispersive stability of the zero equilibrium state",
    "is proved for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , i.e. for sufficiently weak nonlinearities near the origin .",
    "more precisely , the amplitude ( i.e. supremum norm ) of the solution of the fpu lattice ( [ ncrelham ] ) goes to @xmath14 when @xmath15 for all initial conditions sufficiently small in @xmath16 , where @xmath16 denotes the classical banach space of bi - infinite summable sequences .",
    "in contrast , in many situations nonlinear effects are strong enough to compensate dispersion , yielding the existence of coherent localized solutions of the fpu lattice ( [ ncrelham ] ) such as solitary waves propagating at constant speed , or time - periodic breathers ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . the first existence result for solitary waves in a general class of fpu lattices",
    "was obtained by friesecke and wattis @xcite , when @xmath3 has a local minimum ( not necessarily strict ) at the origin and is superquadratic at one side ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , the existence of solitary waves near the so - called long wave limit was established in @xcite for smooth ( @xmath17 ) potentials @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( i.e. @xmath20 in ( [ potential - v ] ) ) , there exists a family of small amplitude solitary waves parameterized by their velocity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 defines the  sound velocity \" of linear waves .",
    "these solutions take the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , these solitary waves decay exponentially in space and broaden in the limit of vanishing amplitude .",

    "in addition , the nonlinear stability of small amplitude fpu solitary waves was proved in @xcite , as well as the existence and stability of asymptotic @xmath33-soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "these results allow to describe in particular the propagation of compression solitary waves in homogeneous granular chains under precompression @xcite .",
    "another interesting case corresponds to fully - nonlinear interaction potentials , where @xmath34 ( which corresponds to a vanishing sound velocity , that is , @xmath35 ) and @xmath3 has a local minimum at the origin .",
    "a classical example is given by the hertzian potential @xmath36 with @xmath0 , where we denote by @xmath37 the heaviside step function .",
    "this potential describes the contact force between two initially tangent elastic bodies ( in the absence of precompression ) after a small relative displacement @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the most classical case is obtained for @xmath39 and corresponds to contact between spheres , or more generally two smooth non - conforming surfaces .",
    "more recently , granular chains involving different orders of nonlinearity have attracted much attention , see @xcite and references therein . in particular , experimental and numerical studies on solitary wave propagation",
    "have been performed with chains of hollow spherical particles of different width @xcite and chains of cylinders @xcite , leading to different values @xmath1 in the range @xmath40 ( see also @xcite for other systems with @xmath1 close to unity ) .",
    "the propagation of stationary compression pulses in the fpu lattice ( [ nc ] ) with potential ( [ vhertz ] ) for @xmath39 was first analyzed by nesterenko @xcite .",
    "these results rely on a formal continuum limit and provide approximate solitary wave solutions with compact support .",
    "an alternate continuum limit problem has been introduced in @xcite for arbitrary values of @xmath0 , leading to different ( compactly supported ) approximations of solitary waves .",
    "the existence of exact solitary wave solutions of the fpu lattice ( [ nc ] ) with potential ( [ vhertz ] ) follows from the general result of friesecke and wattis @xcite mentioned previously ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the width of these solitary waves is independent of their amplitude due to the homogeneous nonlinearity of the hertzian potential .",
    "in addition , the fully - nonlinear character of the hertzian potential induces a doubly - exponential spatial decay of solitary waves @xcite .",
    "while the above analytical results provide useful informations on strongly localized solitary waves , they are not entirely satisfactory for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the existence result of @xcite does not provide an approximation of the solitary wave profile , and the approximations available in the literature @xcite rely on a  long wave \" assumption that is not justified ( for example , the solitary waves considered in @xcite are approximately localized on five particles ) .",
    "in addition , the dynamical properties of solitary waves in fully - nonlinear fpu lattices are not yet understood .",
    "indeed , no mathematical results are available concerning their stability , the way they are affected by lattice inhomogeneities , or the existence of @xmath33-soliton solutions .",
    "another interesting problem is to characterize the excitation of one or several solitary waves from a localized initial perturbation @xcite . for @xmath41 and small amplitude long waves ,",
    "this problem can be partially analyzed in the framework of kdv approximation by using the inverse scattering transform methods @xcite , but such reduction is presently unavailable for fully - nonlinear fpu lattices .",
    "these questions are important for the analysis of impact propagation in granular media , and more generally for the design of multiple impact laws in multibody mechanical systems @xcite .    in this paper , we attack the problem by considering a suitable long wave limit of fully - nonlinear fpu lattices .",
    "we consider the fpu lattice ( [ nc ] ) with the homogeneous fully - nonlinear interaction potential @xmath42 with @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , all solutions @xmath43 of the fpu lattice ( [ nc ] ) with the potential ( [ vhom ] ) are also solutions of the hertzian fpu lattice ( [ nc ] ) and ( [ vhertz ] ) .",
    "the problem can be rewritten in terms of the relative displacements in the following way @xmath44 where we denote @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the discrete laplacian . for approximating the temporal dynamics of ( [ ncrel ] ) in a continuum limit",
    ", fully - nonlinear versions of the boussinesq equation considered in @xcite possess serious drawbacks , since they may lead to blow - up phenomena in analogy with the classical  bad \" boussinesq equation @xcite . in section [ bouss ]",
    ", we numerically show that these models introduce artificial dynamical instabilities with arbitrarily large growth rates , which suggests ill - posedness of these equations @xcite . instead of using a boussinesq - type model ,",
    "we then formally derive a logarithmic kdv ( log - kdv ) equation as a modulation equation for long waves in fully - nonlinear fpu lattices , obtained in the limit @xmath2 ( section [ deriv ] ) .",
    "the log - kdv equation takes the form @xmath47 and provides approximate solutions @xmath48 of the original fpu lattice ( [ ncrel ] ) for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .    the log - kdv equation ( [ kdv-1 ] )",
    "admits gaussian solitary wave solutions ( section [ trav ] ) , which have been previously identified as solutions of the stationary logarithmic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( log - nls ) in the context of nonlinear wave mechanics @xcite .",
    "closer to our case , gaussian homoclinic solutions have been also found to approximate the envelope of stationary breather solutions in newton s cradle ( i.e. system ( [ nc ] ) and ( [ vhertz ] ) with an additional on - site potential ) in the limit @xmath2 @xcite . in section [ trav ] , we numerically check that solitary wave solutions of the hertzian fpu lattice with velocity @xmath52 converge towards gaussian approximations when @xmath53 is fixed and @xmath2 .",
    "these solitary waves have velocities close to unity , which corresponds to the value of sound velocity in the linear chain with @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , we check that the fpu solitary waves are well approximated by the compacton solutions derived in @xcite when @xmath55 $ ] . to go beyond the stationary regime ,",
    "we check numerically that the gaussian approximation captures the asymptotic shape of a stable pulse forming after a localized velocity perturbation in the hertzian fpu lattice ( [ nc])-([vhertz ] ) with @xmath56 ( section [ gauss ] ) . consistently with the above dynamical simulations , we prove in section [ lstab ] the linear orbital stability of gaussian solitary waves for the log - kdv equation .",
    "our analysis makes use of a suitable convex conserved lyapunov function , but negative index techniques developed in recent works @xcite for kdv - type equations would also apply .",
    "the link between gaussian solitary waves and compactons is made explicit is section [ comprev ] , where we check the pointwise convergence of the compacton solutions of @xcite towards gaussian profiles when @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , following the methodology developed in section [ deriv ] , we derive from the fully - nonlinear fpu lattice a generalized kdv equation with hlder - continuous nonlinearity ( h - kdv ) : @xmath57 when @xmath2 , the h - kdv equation ( [ kdv-2 ] ) is consistent with the fpu lattice in the sense that each solution to this equation  almost \" satisfies ( [ ncrel ] ) up to a small residual error .",
    "equation ( [ kdv-2 ] ) admits explicit compacton solutions whose form is close to the compactons obtained in @xcite with the use of a boussinesq  type model .",
    "when @xmath2 , these solutions converge towards the gaussian solitary waves studied in section [ trav ] , and thus they provide an ( asymptotically exact ) approximation of fpu solitary waves with near - sonic speed .",
    "this result sheds a new light on the compacton approximations for fpu solitary waves heuristically derived in the literature @xcite .",
    "another interest of the h - kdv equation lies in the ( non - differentiable ) hlder - continuous nonlinearity @xmath58 which allows for the existence of compactons .",
    "this type of degeneracy is quite different from the classical feature of compacton equations which incorporate degenerate nonlinear dispersion @xcite .",
    "we finish this paper with a summary of our results and a discussion of several open questions concerning the qualitative dynamics of the log - kdv and h - kdv equations and their connections with fully - nonlinear fpu chains ( section [ alt ] ) .",
    "fully nonlinear boussinesq equations have been introduced in @xcite as formal continuum limits of fpu chains with hertzian - type potentials . in @xcite ,",
    "the continuum limit is performed on system ( [ nc ] ) with potential ( [ vhom ] ) describing particle displacements , whereas @xcite considers system ( [ ncrel ] ) for relative displacements . in what follows",
    ", we discuss the continuum limit introduced in @xcite , which takes a slightly simpler form than the system derived in @xcite .",
    "the fully nonlinear boussinesq equation introduced in @xcite takes the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes an approximation of a solution @xmath61 of ( [ ncrel ] ) .",
    "the right side of ( [ b ] ) is obtained by keeping the first two terms of the formal taylor expansion of the discrete laplacian in ( [ ncrel ] ) @xmath62 this truncation is purely formal , but a numerical justification is presented in @xcite in the particular case of solitary wave solutions .",
    "more precisely , the solitary waves @xmath63 , @xmath64 of ( [ ncrel ] ) are numerically compared with solitary wave solutions @xmath65 , @xmath66 of ( [ b ] ) . for this class of solutions , equation ( [ b ] ) reduces to a fourth order ordinary differential equation , which can be integrated twice and leads to @xmath67 whereas equation ( [ ncrel ] ) reduces to the differential advance - delay equation @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "the wave velocity can be normalized to unity due to a scaling invariance of the fpu system ( [ nc ] ) with homogeneous potential ( [ vhom ] ) ( or hertzian potential ( [ vhertz ] ) ) , namely each solution @xmath61 generates a one - parameter family of solutions @xmath70 with @xmath71 ( the same scaling invariance exists in system ( [ b ] ) ) .    according to the numerical computations presented in @xcite , the solitary wave of the differential advance - delay equation ( [ diffadvdel - eq ] )",
    "is well approximated by the compactly supported solitary wave of the differential equation ( [ compacton - eq ] ) for @xmath72 , and the discrepancy increases with @xmath1 .",
    "the compacton solution of ( [ compacton - eq ] ) found in @xcite takes the form @xmath73 where @xmath74    in what follows , we reexamine the consistency of ( [ ncrel ] ) and ( [ b ] ) from a dynamical point of view , by analyzing the spectral stability of compactons . linearizing ( [ b ] ) at the compacton @xmath75 in the reference frame travelling with unit velocity , we use the ansatz @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the spectral parameter and @xmath78 is the perturbation term .",

    "we look for eigenvectors in the hilbert space @xmath85 since @xmath86 and @xmath87 are discontinuous at @xmath84 , this yields the condition @xmath88 this allows us to reduce the eigenvalue problem ( [ b - lin ] ) to the compact interval @xmath89 $ ] with boundary conditions ( [ b - bc ] ) , and approximate the spectrum with the standard finite difference method ( we have used second - order difference approximations for derivatives and @xmath90 grid points ) .",
    "if there exist eigenvalues with @xmath91 , then the solitary wave is spectrally unstable .",
    "if all the eigenvalues are located at the imaginary axis , then the solitary wave is called spectrally stable .",
    "figure [ fig - spectrum ] shows the complex eigenvalues @xmath77 of the spectral problem ( [ b - lin])-([b - bc ] ) for @xmath92 .",
    "the spectrum is invariant under @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( note the presence of a small number non - symmetric eigenvalues , which originate from numerical errors ) .",
    "we find the existence of unstable eigenvalues for all values of @xmath0 considered , and the eigenvalues approach the real line far from the origin ( this part of the spectrum is not visible in the first two panels of figure [ fig - spectrum ] ) .",
    "consequently , these results imply the spectral instability of the compacton ( [ compacton ] ) in system ( [ b ] ) .",
    "note that the usual notion of instability may not be well defined , since the evolution problem ( [ b ] ) may not be well posed . indeed",
    ", our numerical results indicate that the spectrum of ( [ b - lin])-([b - bc ] ) is unbounded in the positive half - plane ( in fact at both sides of the imaginary axis ) , and thus the linearized evolution problem may be ill - posed .",
    "we conjecture that ill - posedness occurs also in system ( [ b ] ) , in analogy with ill - posedness results recently obtained in @xcite for certain nonlinear degenerate dispersive equations .    along these lines , it is interesting to consider the limit case of the spectral problem ( [ b - lin])-([b - bc ] ) when @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath95 for all @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the limiting spectral problem possesses constant coefficients and is defined on the entire real line . using the fourier transform",

    "<S> we consider a class of fully - nonlinear fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) lattices , consisting of a chain of particles coupled by fractional power nonlinearities of order @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this class of systems incorporates a classical hertzian model describing acoustic wave propagation in chains of touching beads in the absence of precompression . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the propagation of localized waves when @xmath1 is close to unity . </S>",
    "<S> solutions varying slowly in space and time are searched with an appropriate scaling , and two asymptotic models of the chain of particles are derived consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is a logarithmic kdv equation , and possesses linearly orbitally stable gaussian solitary wave solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the second model consists of a generalized kdv equation with hlder - continuous fractional power nonlinearity and admits compacton solutions , i.e. solitary waves with compact support . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2 , we numerically establish the asymptotically gaussian shape of exact fpu solitary waves with near - sonic speed , and analytically check the pointwise convergence of compactons towards the limiting gaussian profile . </S>"
