    "quantum transport in periodic potentials is a topic of permanent interest since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "recently this topic has attracted a renewed interest thanks to the experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices , where the quantum dynamics can be observed both in real and in momentum space . in particular , during the last decade much attention has been devoted to the phenomenon of bloch oscillations of cold atoms subject to a static ( for example , gravitational ) field ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite to cite just a few of the relevant papers ) .",
    "these new studies have also shed additional light on the old problem of electron transport in a solid crystal induced by an external electric field @xcite .",
    "present research in cold atoms physics is also focused on the problem of generating synthetic magnetic fields , which could impart a lorenz  like force to otherwise neutral atoms in motion @xcite .",
    "this opens an interesting perspective for studying the quantum hall effect with cold atoms in 2d optical lattices @xcite .",
    "a preliminary but necessary step in this direction is the analysis of the bloch dynamics of cold atoms in the presence of an artificial magnetic field @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study these dynamics in the tight - binding approximation , where the single - particle hamiltonian of an atom in a 2d lattice has a relatively simple form . in spite of this simple form ,",
    "we find a surprisingly rich variety of behaviors , which range from the ballistic spreading of the wave - packet to directed transport .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the model and perform a preliminary analysis , following the standard route which leads to the harper equation @xcite and , hence , is referred to as the harper approach .",
    "the harper approach reduces the original 2d problem to a 1d problem , which on the one hand is simpler to describe , but on the other hand it limits the class of initial conditions that can be considered .",
    "therefore , in sec .  [ sec3 ]",
    "we tackle the problem using the more powerful formalism of landau - stark states , which are the eigenstates of a charged particle in a lattice subject to both magnetic and electric fields . in some sense",
    "this approach is opposite to the harper approach : here one begins with a particle in an electric field ( i.e. , with the problem of bloch oscillations ) and then introduces a magnetic field .",
    "the landau - stark states approach is fully two dimensional and , hence , imposes no limitations on the class of initial conditions that can be considered .",
    "in addition , it allows us to construct 2d localized wave packets , which propagate across the lattice without changing their shapes .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we discuss the transport in the presence of on - site disorder .",
    "here we consider generic initial conditions in the form of a wide incoherent wave packet . in this case , for vanishing disorder , the wave  packet spreads ballistically in the direction orthogonal to the electric field .",
    "we study the modifications of this ballistic spreading caused by the presence of on - site disorder . in the case of null magnetic field",
    "this problem was considered in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "our analysis unveils the differences between the 1d harper approach of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] and the full 2d approach of sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , that , to the contrary , predict the same rate of ballistic spreading when disorder is absent or negligible .",
    "this provides us with a significant new model for the problem of anderson localization , where the effective dimensionality is larger than one but smaller than two .",
    "in this section we introduce the physical model under investigation and we discuss two common approximations .",
    "we also derive a first dynamical phenomenon : the presence of a drift of the particle / wave  packet with constant velocity .",
    "let us therefore consider a quantum particle of mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath1 in a 2d square lattice of side @xmath2 in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane , created by a periodic potential @xmath5 .",
    "the particle is also under the action of an in - plane electric field , aligned with the @xmath4 axis and of a magnetic field normal to the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane .",
    "this particle is described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vector potential .",
    "a convenient choice of the vector potential , corresponding to the field configuration described above is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the magnetic and electric field magnitudes , respectively , and where vectors are described in line notation .",
    "it is easy to check that the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) commutes with the generalized translation operator @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the usual translation operator and where @xmath13 the parameter @xmath14 defines the so - called magnetic period @xmath15 , which has the dimensions of a length and will play an important role in the following .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the motion generated by the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) is a difficult , unsolved problem .",
    "therefore , one deals with this problem by introducing suitable approximations .",
    "the simplest approximation of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) starts by defining the effective mass @xmath16 as the curvature of the ground bloch band of ( [ 1 ] ) at @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dispersion relation .",
    "the approximate hamiltonian then reads @xmath20 for vanishing electric field the eigenfunctions of ( [ 4 ] ) are landau oscillators with energy spectrum @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "it appears from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) that a non - zero value of @xmath10 shifts the origin of a landau oscillator linearly in time .",
    "thus , the particle is transported in the direction orthogonal to the electric field with a drift velocity @xmath23 .",
    "although the effective mass approximation correctly predicts the drift velocity , it completely ignores the lattice discreteness , which is important in many aspects . to take the lattice discreteness into account one",
    "usually introduces a tight - binding approximation to the original hamiltonian .",
    "the tight - binding approximation amounts to the following ansatz for the wave function of the system , @xmath24 that is written in terms of two - dimensional wannier states @xmath25 . in this approximation one also neglects coupling other than between nearest neighbors pairs of states , so to approximate the hamiltonian ( [ 1]-[2 ] ) in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bloch frequency .",
    "this latter is the second characteristic frequency of the system , which is overlooked by the effective mass approximation .",
    "the hopping matrix elements @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the hamiltonian ( [ 6 ] ) can be related via eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) to the parameters of the original system as @xmath30 . in what follows , to simplify equations",
    ", we shall set @xmath1 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 to unity .",
    "the magnetic period is then given by @xmath33 , the bloch frequency becomes @xmath34 , the cyclotron frequency @xmath35 and the drift velocity @xmath36    the hamiltonian ( [ 6 ] ) with four parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath14 , and @xmath37 defines the model being analyzed in the following sections .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in wave - packet dynamics of the system ( [ 6 ] ) , which is governed by the schrdinger equation for the amplitudes @xmath38 : @xmath39 remark that the discrete index @xmath40 refers to the @xmath3 direction , while @xmath41 labels the @xmath4 direction , parallel to the electric field .",
    "we begin our analysis of the system dynamics with considering a class of initial conditions with uniform probability density along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "this leads to a one - dimensional reduction of the quantum problem .",
    "in fact , in this case we may use the substitution @xmath42 which reduces the schrdinger equation ( [ 7 ] ) to the following 1d equation for the amplitudes @xmath43 : @xmath44 the substitution ( [ 7z ] ) assumes periodic boundary conditions , of period @xmath45 , that eventually tends to infinity .",
    "equation ( [ 7a ] ) can be rewritten in the more familiar form of the schrdinger equation for the driven harper hamiltonian @xmath46 in this paper we shall mostly limit ourselves to the case @xmath47 , which can be considered as a semiclassical limit for harper - like hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "thus , we can appeal to the quantum - classical correspondence to facilitate the physical understanding of the problem .",
    "letting the operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 be considered as classical canonical variables yields the the classical driven harper hamiltonian @xmath50     and @xmath51 , a small @xmath52 and moderate @xmath10 below and above @xmath53.,width=434 ]    figure [ fig1 ] shows the poincare surfaces of section for the classical motions .",
    "phase trajectories near the stationary point @xmath54 in the panel ( a ) , which refers to the case @xmath51 , encircle this point with the cyclotron frequency ( [ 6a ] ) and are thus associated with the landau states in the effective mass approximation . for weak field intensity @xmath10 , these trajectories are captured into the nonlinear resonance , which is seen as the stability island in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b - c ) , and are transported with the drift velocity @xmath55 .",
    "the stability island , however , shrinks with increasing @xmath10 and completely disappears when @xmath56 , where @xmath57 thus the drift is possible only if @xmath58 .",
    "translated into the quantum language this means that the landau state can be transported only if the condition ( [ 9 ] ) is satisfied . to support this statement , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the dynamics of a localized wave packet associated with the ground landau state in the effective mass approximation , given by the initial condition @xmath59 . a nice ,",
    "directed transport is observed only in a weak field regime , while in the strong field regime the wave packet spreads almost symmetrically both directions .",
    "remark that these results refer to the one - dimensional model ( [ 7a ] ) .",
    "we will describe wave - packet spreading in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec4a ] .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) removes a seemingly illogical consequence of eq .",
    "( [ 6b ] ) , that predicts an infinite drift velocity for null magnetic field . as a matter of facts ,",
    "when the magnetic field intensity @xmath9 tends to zero , the transporting island in figure [ fig1 ] disappears .",

    "the time axis is measured in units of the bloch period @xmath67 and we have arbitrarily set @xmath68 for null electric field .",

    "note that this asymmetric spreading does not imply a preferable transport in either direction , since the first moment of the position of the packet is null .",

    "these regimes are determined by the relation between two dimensionless parameters  the parameter @xmath14 , which is proportional to magnetic field magnitude and the parameter @xmath155 , which is proportional to the electric field magnitude and is defined as the ratio of the stark energy to the hopping matrix element .    for vanishing magnetic field , @xmath156 ,",
    "the electric field induces bloch oscillations of the wave packet in the field direction , while in the orthogonal direction the wave packet spreads ballistically with a rate defined by @xmath157 . under the condition of stark localization ,",
    "@xmath158 , this regime is also valid if @xmath159 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath160 implies that the amplitude of bloch oscillations is smaller than one lattice site .    in the weak field regime , @xmath161 ,",
    "the dynamics are richer and depend on the relative size between the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath155 .",
    "namely , if @xmath162 the wave - packet still spreads ballistically , although the spreading becomes asymmetric .",
    "a qualitative change happens if @xmath163 .",
    "note that in dimensional units this condition reads @xmath164 , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the bloch and cyclotron frequencies , respectively . here , the wave packets splits into several sub  packets , of which the right  most moves with the drift velocity @xmath55 .",
    "this sub - packet is supported by the transporting states , the explicit form of which is given in sec .",
    "[ sec3b ] .",
    "we have explained the observed dynamical regimes by analyzing the energy spectrum of the system , which can be easily calculated numerically .",
    "this spectrum has a band structure with specific band patterns , sensitive to the system parameters .",
    "analyzing these patterns one can make predictions about the wave - packet dynamics even before performing the demanding simulation of the 2d schrdinger equation .    in this work we have also derived and tested a 1d approximation to the original 2d schrdinger equation , which leads to the driven harper hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "this latter is interesting in its own , because the driven harper system is more easly realized in the lab than 2d lattices with artificial electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the 1d model is capable to capture some important features of the 2d wave - packet dynamics .",
    "finally we have studied the effect of on - site disorder on the dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is found that disorder changes both the ballistic and transporting regimes into the regime of anderson localization , which can be preceded by a diffusive regime .",
    "the observed diffusive spreading of the wave packet together with asymptotic anderson localization indicates that on - site disorder converts the extended landau - stark states ( which are the system eigenstates for vanishing disorder ) into localized states with a non ",
    "trivial scaling law .",
    "this scaling law is a problem open to further investigation .",
    "an additional open problem , which we reserve for future studies , is the case of an arbitrary direction of the electric field .",
    "it is known that bloch oscillations of a quantum particle on a 2d lattice changes drastically if the field vector is misaligned with respect the lattice axis @xcite .",
    "thus one may expect the quantum transport in the presence of a magnetic field to be also different .",
