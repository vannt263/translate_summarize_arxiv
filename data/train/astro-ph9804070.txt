    "gx340 + 0 is a bright low - mass x - ray binary and a z source ( @xcite ) .",
    "the z - track traced out in the x - ray color - color ( cd ) and hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) is usually built up of three components , the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the normal branch ( nb ) , and the flaring branch ( fb ) . the mass accretion rate ( @xmath10 ) is thought to increase from a few tens of the eddington mass accretion rate when the source is on the hb , to near - eddington on the nb , and super - eddington on the fb . on the hb and the upper part of the nb of gx340 + 0 , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with frequencies of 3250 hz",
    ", the horizontal branch oscillations ( hbos ) , were detected by penninx et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . on the central part of the nb , qpos with a typical frequency of 5.6 hz ,",
    "the normal branch oscillations ( nbos ) , were detected by van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . in four z sources , scox-1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , gx5 - 1 ( @xcite ) , gx17 + 2 ( @xcite ) , and cygx-2 ( @xcite ) two simultaneous kilo hertz ( khz ) qpos have been observed , with frequencies reflecting flux changes on timescales close to the dynamical timescales near a neutron star .",
    "the higher frequency peak ( henceforth called upper peak ) has been proposed to reflect the keplerian frequency of blobs of material orbiting around the neutron star , at a preferred radius in the disk , such as the sonic radius ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "the lower frequency peak ( henceforth called lower peak ) is the proposed beat frequency between the frequency of the upper peak and the spin frequency of the neutron star .",
    "the khz qpo frequency is observed to increase with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "similar khz qpos are also found in atoll sources .",
    "the frequencies of the khz qpos are between 300 and 1200 hz .",
    "( see van der klis ( 1997 ) for a recent overview ) . in this letter",
    "we report the discovery of two simultaneous khz qpos in the z source gx340 + 0 .",
    "a preliminary announcement of these results was already made by wijnands & van der klis ( 1998b ) .",
    "we observed gx340 + 0 with the proportional counter array onboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer on 1997 apr.17 , sept.21,23,25 , and nov.1,2,3 , and 4 .",
    "the total amount of good data obtained was 138 ksec . during 5% of this time only three or four of the five detectors were active . for our cd and hid we used only the data from the three detectors that were always active . in our power",
    "spectral analysis we used all available data .",
    "the mean five - detector countrate was @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the data were obtained using 16s time resolution in 129 photon energy bands ( effective energy range 260 kev ) , and simultaneously with 122 @xmath13 time resolution in four bands ( 25.0 kev , 5.06.4 kev , 6.48.6 kev , and 8.660 kev ) on apr.17 or in two bands for the other dates ( 25.0 kev and 5.060 kev ) .",
    "we calculated power density spectra using the 122 @xmath13 data divided into 16s segments . to determine the properties of the khz qpos we fitted the 954096 hz power spectra with a function that consisted of one or two lorentzians ( the khz qpos ) and a constant plus a broad sinusoid ( the dead - time modified poisson noise ) ( @xcite ) . the very large event window ( @xcite )",
    "was set to 55 @xmath13 , so that its effect on the poisson noise is small and could be incorporated in the sinusoid .",
    "to determine the properties of the hbo , we fitted the 0.125126.5 hz power spectra using a function which consisted of the sum of a constant , one or two lorentzian peaks , and two exponentially cut - off power - law components .",
    "the errors were determined using @xmath14 ( 1@xmath15 single parameter ) and upper limits using @xmath16 , corresponding to a @xmath17 confidence level .",
    "upper limits on the khz qpos were determined using a fixed fwhm of 150 hz . when only the lower peak was detected , the upper limit on the upper peak was determined by setting the frequency to the value of the frequency of the lower peak plus the mean frequency difference between the two peaks .",
    "upper limits on the hbo were determined by keeping the fwhm fixed at 10 hz . in the hid and cd",
    ", the hard color is defined as the logarithm of the 9.716.0 kev/6.49.7 kev countrate ratio .",
    "the soft color is defined as the logarithm of the 3.56.4 kev/23.5 kev countrate ratio .",
    "the intensity is defined as the logarithm of the countrate in the 216.0 kev band .",
    "the hid and cd are background - corrected but no dead - time correction was carried out .",
    "the dead - time correction factor was @xmath6 . in order to measure the position along the z - track",
    ", we use the @xmath18 parametrization ( e.g. @xcite ) applied to the hid . in this parametrization",
    "the hb / nb vertex is fixed at @xmath19 and the nb / fb vertex at @xmath20 .",
    "we selected the power spectra according to @xmath18 , and determined the average @xmath18 and standard deviation for each selection .",
    "the track of the nov.4 data is shifted towards higher intensity and softer colors with respect to the z - track in the other data .",
    "we therefore determined the hbo properties for the nov.4 data ( @xmath21 18 ksec ) separately . to determine the khz qpo properties we combined the nov.4 data with the rest in order to get a higher signal to noise ratio .",
    "as the khz qpos were only significantly detected in the 5.060 kev band and the significance did not increase combining the two bands , we used only the 5.060 kev band in our analysis .",
    "we observed a full z - track in the hid and cd ( fig .",
    "[ hid+cd ] ) .",
    "the z - shape shows a fourth branch beyond the fb .",
    "this extra , trailing branch was seen before in gx340 + 0 ( @xcite ) and gx5 - 1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "detailed examination of the hb / nb vertex in the hid revealed that the 1997 nov.4 data were shifted to higher count rates ( @xmath22 ) and softer colors ( @xmath23 ) than the other data . due to this shift , which occurred during a 1.2 day gap between two observations ,",
    "the hb / nb vertex in the hid is broadened . due to the size of the dots in fig .",
    "[ hid+cd ] this is not visible .",
    "this shift was also seen in exosat data of gx340 + 0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we detected khz qpos in the 5.060 kev band ( fig .",
    "[ pdskhz+hbo ] ) .",
    "the lower khz peak was detected at @xmath18 values up to 1.04 , the upper peak up to @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ khz+hbo ] ) .",
    "the lower peak had a frequency of @xmath25 hz at @xmath26 and increased to @xmath2 hz at @xmath27 , its rms amplitude remained about constant at values near 2% , and its fwhm varied between 30 and 160 hz with no clear correlation with @xmath18 .",
    "the frequency of the upper peak was @xmath1 hz at @xmath26 and increased to @xmath3 hz at @xmath24 , while its rms amplitude decreased from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , and its fwhm from @xmath5 hz to @xmath7 hz .",
    "the fwhm ratio did not significantly depend on @xmath18 .",
    "when both peaks were detected , the peak separation was consistent with being constant at a value of @xmath8 hz .",
    "we did not detect significant khz qpos in the 25.0 kev bands , with upper limits of 2.8% and 2.3% at @xmath30 and 2.7% and 2.8% at @xmath31 for the lower and upper peaks , respectively , while in the 5.060 kev band the peaks were found with a rms amplitude of 1.5% and 4.4% at @xmath30 and 1.6% and 2.8% at @xmath31 , respectively . simultaneously with the khz qpo , the hbo and its second harmonic were detected .",
    "when we used the same @xmath18 selections as in the fitting of the khz qpos the hbo sometimes showed double peaks , especially at low @xmath18 .",
    "this was caused by the steep dependence of the hbo frequency on @xmath18 and its narrow peak width .",
    "therefore up to @xmath32 , we used narrower @xmath18 selections in fitting the hbo to prevent the hbo peak from moving too much within the selection .",
    "the hbo frequency increased from @xmath33 hz at @xmath34 to @xmath35 hz at @xmath36 .",
    "then it remained constant up to @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ khz+hbo ] b ) .",
    "the rms amplitude in the 5.060 kev energy band of the hbo decreased smoothly from @xmath38% at the left side of the hb ( @xmath34 ) to @xmath39% on the nb ( @xmath37 ) . for higher @xmath18 selections ,",
    "no hbo was detected , with upper limits of @xmath6 rms .",
    "the fwhm increased from @xmath40 hz to @xmath41 hz .",
    "we did not find a clear dependence on @xmath18 of the rms amplitude and fwhm of the second harmonic .",
    "due to the presence of a broad noise component around the frequency of the second harmonic it was difficult to determine the properties of either one of the two components .",
    "we found that the hbo frequency vs. @xmath18 relation of the nov.4 data was offset with respect to that of the other data ( fig .",
    "[ hbo+4novhbo ] left ) , due to the shift in the vertex of the nov.4 data , which along the hb , corresponds to a shift in @xmath18 of @xmath42 , equal to the offset in the @xmath18 vs. @xmath43 plot ( fig .",
    "[ hbo+4novhbo ] , left ) .",
    "if we correct for the change in @xmath18 by measuring @xmath18 on nov.4 from the hb / nb vertex appropriate for that date , the hbo frequencies , rms amplitude , and fwhm of the nov.4 data and the hbo frequencies , rms amplitude , and fwhm of the other data as a function of @xmath18 are the same ( fig .",
    "[ hbo+4novhbo ] , right ) .",
    "this strengthens previous conclusions ( @xcite ) that @xmath18 , not count rate , is the better measure for @xmath10 .",
    "we also detected the nbos , between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these will be more extensively discussed elsewhere .",
    "we have discovered khz qpos in the z source gx340 + 0 .",
    "the frequencies of both the lower and upper peak increased as the source moved along the hb to the hb / nb vertex .",
    "the peak separation was consistent with being constant .",
    "this is similar to what was found in gx17 + 2 ( @xcite ) , cygx-2 ( @xcite ) , and gx5 - 1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . only in scox-1 ( @xcite ) and",
    "perhaps in the atoll source 4u 1608 - 52 ( @xcite ) the peak separation was found to decrease with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "if this decrease in sco x-1 is in some way related to the source approching the eddington critical luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , this could mean that if we were able to detect the khz qpos in gx340 + 0 and the other z - sources ( further ) up the nb we might also see the peak separation decrease .",
    "the lower peak reaches the so far lowest `` khz '' qpo frequency found in any low mass x - ray binary , 247 hz . the maximum frequency reached by the upper peak , 820 hz , is also rather low . using the sonic - point model ( @xcite ) to explain the upper peak khz qpo frequency , we found lower limits on the mass of the neutron star of @xmath46 for a neutron star radius of 4 m , and @xmath47 for a neutron star radius of 7 m .",
    "( the implicit assumptions made in calculating these lower limits are : schwarzschild spacetime metric , non - rotating radiating layer , and photons remove angular momentum from the disk material only in one scattering event . ) we note that the frequencies of the khz qpos seem to confirm the idea ( e.g. @xcite ) that gx340 + 0 is more similar in appearance to gx5 - 1 ( @xcite ) , than to scox-1 ( @xcite ) , and gx17 + 2 ( @xcite ) ( frequencies higher than 1000 hz ) . any straightforward beat - frequency model predicts the upper peak to be narrower than , or as narrow as the lower peak .",
    "we find in gx340 + 0 that the upper peak is usually broader than the lower peak .",
    "in fact , the upper peaks found in gx340 + 0 were very broad with @xmath48 up to 0.67 at @xmath34 .",
    "therefore a straightforward beat - frequency interpretation of the two peaks in gx340 + 0 is difficult . in gx340 + 0 ,",
    "gx5 - 1 ( @xcite ) , and gx17 + 2 ( @xcite ) the upper peak fwhm decreases as a function of @xmath18 . to explain this behaviour",
    "one could involve scattering in a rapidly variable medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of this scattering should become less as @xmath10 increases .",
    "although the behaviour of the khz qpos as a function of inferred @xmath10 in gx340 + 0 is similar to that found in other z sources , the hbo behaviour is rather different .",
    "the fwhm of the hbo increased as the rms amplitude decreased , which is unlike what is seen in other z sources . in cygx-2",
    "wijnands et al .",
    "( 1997c ) found the fwhm to be well - correlated to the rms . in gx17",
    "+ 2 the fwhm remained about constant while the rms amplitude decreased ( @xcite ) . in previous observations of gx340 + 0 ( @xcite , table 2 )",
    "the behaviour is consistent with our findings . in observations of kuulkers & van der klis ( 1996 )",
    "the fwhm does not show a clear relation as a funtion of the rms amplitude .",
    "exactly the same behaviour ( as we reported for gx340 + 0 ) was found in gx5 - 1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that an extra parameter in addition to @xmath10 determines the timing properties .",
    "another indication of this is that there are differences between the z sources in the position on the z - track where the nbo are found . in gx17",
    "+ 2 ( @xcite ) , and scox-1 ( @xcite ) the nbo were detected up the fb , e.g. @xmath49 . in cygx-2",
    "they were detected up to the nb / fb vertex ( @xcite ) , while in gx340 + 0 and gx5 - 1 the nbo were detected up to @xmath50 .",
    "recently it has been proposed that the hbo frequency may reflect the general relativistic lense - thirring ( lt ) precession frequency at the inner edge of a warped accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the upper peak is interpreted as a keplerian frequency in the inner part of the disk , there is a quadratic relation between the lt precession frequency and the upper peak frequency . applying this theory to our observations and assuming the peak difference to be the neutron star spin frequency , the lt predictions for the hbo frequency are too low by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "the same discrepancy by a factor of 2 has been reported for the z source gx17 + 2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are several ways out , but each appears to create serious difficulties .",
    "@xmath51 ( with i the moment of inertia of the neutron star and m its mass ) may be a factor of 2 higher than presently thought , however , no sensible equation of state appears to be able to produce such values of @xmath51",
    ". the khz qpo peak difference may not be equal to the neutron star spin frequency but to half the spin frequency , however , at least in atoll sources this seems to contradict the results obtained from burst qpo ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hbo may not be the fundamental frequency but the harmonic of the predicted lt frequency , however , in none of the z sources there is any evidence of excess power at frequencies half the hbo frequencies .",
    "we would like to thank jan van paradijs for commenting on the manuscipt and cole miller for the useful discussion on the sonic - point model and the implications of our findings .",
