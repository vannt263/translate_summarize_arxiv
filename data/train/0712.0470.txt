    "the esa gamma - ray observatory integral @xcite is dedicated to the fine spectroscopy ( 2.5 kev fwhm @ 1 mev ) and fine imaging ( angular resolution : 12 arcmin fwhm ) of celestial gamma - ray sources in the energy range 15 kev to 10 mev with concurrent source monitoring in the x - ray ( 3 - 35 kev ) and optical ( v - band , 550 nm ) bands . while the pre - planned scientific observing programme of the mission",
    "is driven by the usual announcement of opportunities with peer reviewed observing proposals , important have also been made by integral .",
    "two of them are briefly described in this paper .",
    "ingredients for new discoveries of point sources above 15 kev are : ( i ) a very large field of view of almost 900 square degrees , ( ii ) arc - minute source location capability , and ( iii ) a broad energy band with good sensitivity .",
    "in addition , long exposures and/or frequent monitoring of the inner galaxy are provided through the general open time observing programme , the core programme ( @xcite , @xcite ) and via the key programmes introduced recently .",
    "nature , finally , contributes the highly variable high - energy sky .",
    "monitoring the sky in the integral energy range is of fundamental importance for targets of opportunities , multi - wavelengths follow - up observations and serendipitous discoveries .",
    "recent hard x - ray sky surveys with integral ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have produced source catalogues containing between 400 and 500 detected point sources , covering energy intervals between 15 kev to 100 kev .",
    "these surveys differ slightly in sky coverage , energy range , time interval , detection criteria and detection software , but we can conclude that , on average , about 17% of all detected sources are hmxb ( 73 sources , on average ) out of which one third are new integral gamma - ray ( igr ) sources identified as hmxb .",
    "about 23% of all detected sources remain yet to be identified . in the following sections we will briefly describe the new hmxb classes as detected by integral : highly obscured hmxb and super - giant fast x - ray transients .",
    "both classes are populated by binary systems , where the compact object is orbiting a massive early - type ob super - giant star .",
    "these systems contribute to about 20% of the galactic hmxb population , while the remaining 80% of hmxb are binaries involving a compact object orbiting a be star .",
    "igr j16318@xmath04848 was discovered by integral on 29 january 2003 @xcite , shortly after the start of the nominal observing programme .",
    "the source is located very close to the galactic plane ( 30@xmath1 off ) , and it was found that strong absorption below 5 kev ( n@xmath2 @xmath3 2@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 ) is dominating the spectral distribution of the hmxb with a compact object enshrouded in a compton thick environment @xcite .",
    "subsequent long term monitoring confirmed that the source remained bright and compton thick @xcite . using data from xmm - newton ,",
    "asca and rxte , more integral detected igr sources with similar broad band ",
    "highly absorbed ",
    "spectra could be identified @xcite .",
    "how many of these sources have been detected ( until end 2006 ) by integral ?",
    "the recent survey by @xcite displays , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hmxb ] , the spatial distribution of all galactic sources ( mostly hmxb ) detected by the imager ibis on - board integral for which n@xmath2 has been reported .",
    "if we define  highly absorbed  as local absorption in excess of ism absorption in the line - of - sight , that is n@xmath2 @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath6 , then we conclude from table 1 in @xcite that out of 25 hmxb meeting this criterion , 16 sources ( 64% ) are new igr / hmxb sources , and 9 sources ( 36% ) have been known previously .",
    "typical  source geometry and population characteristics are as follows : ( i ) a compact source embedded in dense material ; ( ii ) the fluorescence region is larger than the orbital radius ; ( iii ) spherical geometry ; ( iv ) unknown or weakly detected in x - ray surveys prior to integral ; ( v ) strong low energy absorption n@xmath2 @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath6 ; ( vi ) predominantly located in the galactic bulge and along the norma / scutum spiral arms ; ( vii ) long spin periods ( typically 100 s to 1300 s ) characteristic of wind accretion ; ( viii ) short orbital periods @xmath9 10 days ; ( ix ) early type stellar super - giant companion ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in summary ,",
    "the absorbed systems @xmath0 a new class of hmxb @xmath0 form the majority of active super - giant hmxb in our galaxy .",
    "thanks to the large increase of known hmxb in the inner galaxy , it is now possible to study the hmxb spatial distribution in the inner galaxy and to compare it with the location of star forming regions and spiral arm patterns ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .      thanks to the  ingredients  mentioned in the introduction , another ( sub)class of hmxb previously hidden throughout the galaxy could be identified with integral : the super - giant fast x - ray transients ( sfxt ) . while x - ray transients in general exhibit variations on timescales from few days to weeks or months , the sfxt are characterized by short outbursts lasting typically up to a few hours .",
    "before integral , the nature of these transients was largely unknown ( see @xcite for a summary ) . with integral it was possible to detect new sfxt ; detect for the first time recurrent outbursts , and associate sfxt with super - giant hmxb known to be persistent sources @xcite .",
    "sfxt form a new sub - class of super - giant hmxb and we can assume that there are many more sfxt in our galaxy as previously thought .",
    "the origin of the fast outburst , during which the persistent luminosity of @xmath310@xmath10 erg / s increases by about 3 orders of magnitude is not firmly established : sudden accretion of small ejections originating in a clumpy wind , outbursts near or at periastron , or due to a second wind component ( equatorial disk ) of the super - giant donor ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . up to now",
    "( october 2007 ) , eight firm detections of sfxt4503 , igr j11215@xmath05952 , igr j16465@xmath04507 , xte j17391@xmath03021 , igr j17544@xmath02619 , sax j1818.6@xmath01703 , ax j1841.0@xmath00535 , and igr j18450@xmath00435 ] exist with 20 more candidates under current investigation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "integral discovered new classes of highly absorbed hmxb and sfxt , thanks to its large fov combined with a broad energy range , fine imaging , good sensitivity and observing strategy .",
    "long term monitoring with a large fov is crucial to further enlarge the database .",
    "the new discoveries also pose new problems to be addressed by future observations : why do we find highly absorbed hmxb as slowly rotating neutron stars with modest magnetic fields only , but no cyclotron lines and no black hole candidates ?",
    "how can we explain the fast luminosity increase of sfxt by about 3 orders of magnitude ?",
