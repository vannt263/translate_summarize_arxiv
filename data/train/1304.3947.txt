    "transition state theory has played , and continues to play , a fundamental role in how we think of chemical reactions .",
    "there are many excellent reviews of the subject ; see , for example , refs .",
    "the work of wigner @xcite highlighted the notion of the transition state as a dividing surface ( ds ) in phase space , having the property that trajectories crossed this surface ( only once ) in their evolution from reactants to products .",
    "this phase space point of view was relatively undeveloped for many years until the 1970 s when such a dynamical theory was fully realised for two degrees of freedom ( dof ) in the work of pechukas , pollak and child @xcite . in their work",
    "they realised the construction of such a ds having the ` no recrossing ' property , and a central role was played by a saddle - like ( in terms of stability ) periodic orbit ( po ) which serves as the ` anchor ' for the definition of the ds .",
    "this po was called a periodic orbit dividing surface ( pods ) .",
    "( this choice of name was perhaps unfortunate as the po itself is not the ds [ in phase space ] but rather the _ boundary _ of the ds . )",
    "the work of pechukas , pollak and child just cited was the first example of the use of a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold ( nhim ) in the context of transition state theory ( although see also ref .  ) .    for more than two",
    "dof a suitable generalisation of a saddle like ( or ` hyperbolic ' ) periodic orbit was required , and this was realised in the notion of a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold ( nhim ) .",
    "explicit discussion of nhims in the context of reaction theory was in refs ( see also refs ) .",
    "however , the usefulness of nhims for the definition of phase space dividing surfaces was fully realised only after the development of methods for computing nhims and their associated ds . in particular ,",
    "nhims could be computed using the classical poincar - birkhoff normal form procedure , and its quantum analog @xcite .",
    "however , the poincar - birkhoff normal form procedure is local in nature since it involves a taylor expansion about an appropriate saddle point .",
    "practically , the expansion must be truncated at an appropriate order so that its ability to describe geometrical structures and dynamics at a desired accuracy must be assessed ( and this is , typically , problem dependent ) .",
    "very broadly speaking , the nhim , and its associated local dynamics , are accurately described by the truncated normal form for energies ` close ' to the energy of the saddle point . to date",
    ", our knowledge of nhims for specific problems relies heavily on the techniques used to compute them , in particular normal form theory .",
    "the local nature of these techniques makes nhims tools of limited utility in terms of our ability describe reaction dynamics at energies well above the reaction threshold .",
    "in particular , very little is known about how the nhim behaves as we increase the energy above that of the saddle .",
    "we expect the normal form to ` break down ' ( in some not very precisely defined sense ) .",
    "however , the breakdown of the normal form and the breakdown of the nhim are two separate issues . questions concerning the existence and properties of the nhim can in principle be considered independently of the methods used to compute the nhim , when normal form approximations may no longer apply .    in this paper",
    "we study the behaviour of nhims as the energy above the saddle point is increased , and the dependence on energy of associated quantities related to reaction dynamics",
    ". our strategy will be to avoid the use of normal forms by considering simple models that allow us to explicitly compute the nhim , the ds , and the geometrical properties associated with reaction dynamics .",
    "we can view our approach as a decoupling of normal form issues from the dynamics of reaction .",
    "we then ask the question : `` what happens to a nhim as parameters ( the energy being a very important parameter ) are varied '' ?",
    "in other words , we study ` bifurcation of nhims ' .",
    "but , more specifically for reaction dynamics , we want to understand how such bifurcation of nhims affects the various quantities ( described below ) used to describe reaction dynamics .",
    "first , we need to describe some background regarding what we mean by the ` bifurcation of a nhim ' and then discuss our approach for studying these phenomena .",
    "roughly speaking ( for details , see section [ sec : nhimmodels ] ) a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold has the property that the _ linearized _ growth rates normal to the manifold dominate the",
    "_ linearized _ growth rates tangent to the manifold .",
    "the nature of the dynamics within the invariant manifold can be arbitrary , provided the growth rate conditions are satisfied .",
    "hence , there are several possibilities to consider :    * bifurcation within the nhim , but with the normal hyperbolicity conditions not affected . *",
    "breakdown of the normal hyperbolicity conditions . * a combination of the above two phenomena  bifurcation within the nhim and breakdown of the normal hyperbolicity conditions .",
    "how bifurcation within the nhim occurs and how the normal hyperbolicity conditions can break down will be discussed in detail when we consider explicit models in section [ sec : models ] .",
    "briefly , there are two ways in which such bifurcations can occur .",
    "one is when a parameter in the hamiltonian is varied , and the other is when the energy itself is varied .",
    "( we will be considering only hamiltonian systems .",
    ") of course , energy is a parameter , but its importance in understanding the dynamics is such that we highlight its effects explicitly .    typically in bifurcation theory simple ` normal forms ' are developed that embody the essential features of a particular bifurcation .",
    "we will follow a similar approach here .",
    "our models will be two degree - of - freedom , separable , hamiltonian systems where we have explicit control and understanding of the dynamics in such a way that we can model the three possibilities noted above .",
    "modelling the three possibilities for separable , two dof hamiltonian systems is of course fairly straightforward , but that is the point .",
    "our goal is to determine the effect that the three scenarios outlined above have on quantities that are used to describe reaction dynamics . in particular , we want to consider the effect on :    * the dividing surface ( ds ) separating reactants and products as a function of energy ( the ds is defined and explained in section [ subsec : ds ] ) . * the flux through the ds as a function of energy . * the gap time distribution as a function of energy ( these quantities",
    "are defined and explained in section [ sec : volumes ] ) .    despite the fact that our examples are very simple ( completely integrable 2 dof hamiltonian systems )",
    ", they allow for exact calculations and therefore provide benchmarks against which more complex examples can be compared . in particular , we note a previous study by li and coworkers @xcite which suggests that the breakdown of normal hyperbolicity of the nhim is responsible for the non definability of a relevant ds at high energy above the reaction threshold .",
    "this conclusion is contrary to that reached in the study of our model examples ( see below ) .",
    "a study of allahem and bartsch @xcite asserts that the transition state loses , and then regains normal hyperbolicity as energy is varied .",
    "a study of inarrea et al @xcite concludes that even though bifurcation of the nhim can occur , dividing surfaces can still be defined .",
    "these three studies are concerned with hamilltonian models that are much more complex than ours ( although still 2 dof ) .",
    "we also note an interesting study by yang @xcite , although the models studied there are _ not _ hamiltonian .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follow .",
    "we review the concepts of nhims in section [ sec : nhimmodels ] where we discuss the definition of normal hyperbolicity in detail . in section [ sec : gen_models ]",
    "we discuss the general form for the two dof models that we study .",
    "these models allow us to explicitly compute nhims and quantify their geometrical and stability properties . in section [ sec : volumes ]",
    "we discuss concepts of phase space volumes , gap times , and reaction rates that are relevant for the present study . in section [ sec : models ] we describe the two models for which we will carry out explicit calculations . in section [ subsec",
    ": ds ] we discuss dividing surfaces and compute the flux through the dividing surfaces for our two examples , while section [ subsec : gapdistrib ] deals with the computation of the gap time distribution . in section [ subsecnormalhyperbol ]",
    "we discuss the loss of normal hyperbolicity and its consequences for the ds , flux , and gap time distribution in our examples . in section [ sec : concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the notion of a _ normally hyperbolic invariant manifold _ ( or nhim ) is by now a standard concept and tool in dynamical systems theory that is playing an increasingly important role in a variety of applications .",
    "the theoretical framework developed over the course of many years , beginning in the early part of the 20th century and reached a mature form in the works of fenichel @xcite and hirsch , pugh , and shub @xcite . in ref .   a ( relatively ) elementary exposition of fenichel s approach to nhims",
    "is given with some discussion of applications .",
    "we begin by defining the notion of a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold ( nhim ) in a continuous time setting ( i.e. the setting of autonomous ordinary differential equations , rather than maps ) .",
    "there are numerous definitions that appear throughout the literature .",
    "we take the definition from ref .  .",
    "from an ` applied ' point of view the definition may appear somewhat abstract , leading to difficulties understanding how the definition can be applied in concrete settings .",
    "however , this level of abstraction actually provides a great deal of flexibility for applications , as we shall see when we consider explicit models for illustrating different types of bifurcation phenomena associated with nhims and reaction dynamics .",
    "it is sufficient for our purpose to take phase space to be @xmath0 , which is a @xmath1 differentiable manifold . for inner products and norms on this space",
    "we will take the usual euclidean structures .",
    "phase space is taken to be even dimensional since we will be considering canonical hamiltonian systems , i.e. we consider equations of the following form :    [ eq : ham ] @xmath2    for some function @xmath3 .",
    "we require the hamiltonian @xmath4 to be at least @xmath5 since we will assume the flow that it generates is at least @xmath6 . in practice , this is not a restriction since the explicit hamiltonians that we consider will be infinitely differentiable .",
    "however , in the theoretical description of nhims , it is important to explicitly specify the degree of differentiability of all geometrical objects for reasons that will become apparent as we develop the discussion of nhims further .",
    "note that in this work we will have no need to consider @xmath0 as a symplectic vector space , or to investigate the associated consequences of symplecticity ; this is likely to be a very fruitful avenue for future research .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "roughly , in hamiltonian dynamical systems stability properties are divided into ` elliptic ' and ` hyperbolic ' , where bifurcation _ may _ occur when passing through the boundary between stability types .",
    "results describing ` elliptic stability ' ( e.g. the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) and nekhoroshev theorems ) rely heavily on the hamiltonian structure for their proof . ` hyperbolic stability ' results , on the other hand , do not generally rely on the hamiltonian structure , and that is true for the development of nhims",
    ". it would nevertheless be interesting to know what restrictions hamiltonian structure places on the structure of nhims .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "it is proven that invariant tori in canonical , time independent , hamiltonian systems _ can not _ be normally hyperbolic .",
    "we suppose that @xmath7 is a @xmath6 smooth flow defined on @xmath0 generated by .",
    "we will also need assume the flow to exist for all time , i.e. @xmath8 . as phase space is not compact , we will need to explicitly discuss the issue of existence of the flow for all time in our examples .",
    "we now state the definition of a nhim sufficient for our needs .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the breakdown of normal hyperbolicity and its consequences for reaction dynamics ; in particular , the dividing surface , the flux through the dividing surface ( ds ) , and the gap time distribution . our approach is to study these questions using simple , two degree - of - freedom hamiltonian models where calculations for the different geometrical and dynamical quantities can be carried out exactly . for our examples , we show that resonances within the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold may , or may not , lead to a ` loss of normal hyperbolicity ' . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the onset of such resonances results in a change in topology of the dividing surface , but does not affect our ability to define a ds . </S>",
    "<S> the flux through the ds varies continuously with energy , even as the energy is varied in such a way that normal hyperbolicity is lost . for our examples </S>",
    "<S> the gap time distributions exhibit singularities at energies corresponding to the existence of homoclinic orbits in the ds , but these singularities are not associated with loss of normal hyperbolicity . </S>"
