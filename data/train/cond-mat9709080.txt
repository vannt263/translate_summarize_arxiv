    "after the discovery of the high-@xmath13 materials@xcite , the study of correlations has gained interested due to the fact that there is the belief@xcite that the normal properties of these materials could be explained in the framework of the hubbard model@xcite , since electron correlations are strong , i.e. , the on - site electron - electron repulsions @xmath14 are much larger than the energies associated with the hybridization of atomic orbitals belonging to different atoms@xcite .",
    "the strategy , according to anderson@xcite to address the problem of the high-@xmath13 superconductivity , is to try to find a theory accounting for the normal state properties of the cuprates and then find an electron mechanism which destabilizes the normal state towards a superconducting state .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is a kind of minimum model@xcite which takes into account quantum mechanical motion of electrons in a solid , and nonlinear repulsion between electrons . even thought this model is too simple to describe solids faithfully",
    ", serious theoretical studies have revealed that to understand the various properties of it is a very difficult task , since is the simplest many - body hamiltonian one can write down and which can not be reduced to a single - particle theory@xcite .",
    "its study will prove useful in developing various notions and techniques in statistical physics of many degrees of freedom .",
    "besides cuprate superconductors , the hubbard model may also be applicable to describing the metal - insulating transition in materials like @xmath15 and @xmath16 in which paramagnetic metal , antiferromagnetic insulator , and a phase antiferromagnetic metal are clearly separated in temperature - pressure phase diagram@xcite .",
    "all these features , found in the hubbard model , make it suitable to reproduce experimental data . additionally , the study of correlations by itself in the hubbard model is a rewarding task since it will shed light on still unsolved points of the novel materials .",
    "for example , at high temperatures ( @xmath17 ) these htsc cuprates , which are poor conductors , become superconductors .",
    "this feature is strange indeed because the coulomb repulsion is strong .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of these materials at @xmath18 is even more puzzling than the superconductivity itself .",
    "contrary to the predictions of the fermi liquid theory , the resistivity at @xmath18 and optimum doping is linear in temperature , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "this suggests a very strong scattering of elementary excitations .",
    "a discussion of the possible breakdown of fermi liquid theory is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "there is also another approach which consists in studying toy models , i.e. , exactly solvable,@xcite in order to get some ideas on the one - particle properties of highly correlated electron systems .    in this letter",
    ", we will use the moment approach ( or sum rules ) of nolting@xcite for the spectral density , @xmath20 . as it is well known in the literature@xcite ,",
    "one of the drawbacks of the moment approach in the spherical approximation - where @xmath12 , the narrowing band factor , is not @xmath21 - dependent - is that we _ always _ find a gap in the density of states @xmath22 .",
    "if the chemical potential happens to be in this gap , then we always have an insulator .",
    "it has been argued that the way to cure this unrealistic gap is to have a better approximation for the narrowing band factor , @xmath12 , task which has proven to be hard just to the present@xcite .",
    "it is due to that we have followed a different path which consists in proposing a single pole structure in the self - energy , @xmath23 .",
    "the model we study is the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are creation ( annihilation ) electron operators with spin @xmath27 . @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath14 is the local interaction , @xmath29 the chemical potential and we work in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we have adopted einstein convention for repeated indices , i.e. , for the @xmath30 sites @xmath31 , the @xmath32 nearest - neighbor sites @xmath33 @xmath34 and for spin up and down ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "@xmath36 , for @xmath37 and zero otherwise .",
    "let us propose for the self - energy , @xmath23 , the following single pole ansatz @xmath38 with our choice for @xmath23 , we have the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy satisfy the kramers - kronig relations@xcite .",
    "using the first three sum rules of nolting@xcite for the the spectral function of eq .",
    "( [ akw ] ) we obtain the following equations @xmath44 where the @xmath45 s , @xmath46 are given in ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we do not use the forth moment or sum rule because we are at half - filling .",
    "then , we assume that at @xmath47 the chemical potential , @xmath48 .",
    "this is verified as we will see from our results .",
    "at this moment , we would like to say once more that the drawback of previous calculations ( included ours ) consists in that the density of states which results of the two pole ansatz for the one - particle green function , in the spherical approximation of nolting@xcite , always has a gap .",
    "this solution ( always a gap ) is known in the literature as the hubbard - i solution@xcite which has been critized since many years ago by laura roth@xcite among others .",
    "we call the attention to ref.@xcite where the authors point out to the fact that the @xmath49-dependence has to be included in @xmath12 . however , they study the negative hubbard model in the strong coupling limit and in this limit we have a well developed correlation gap , anyway .",
    "ole and coworkers are practicioners of the two - pole ansatz for the one - particle green function , without lifetime effects . here",
    "we are including lifetime effects as a crucial ingredient in the formulation .",
    "morover , our results clearly show that the cure the hubbard - i solution in the moment approach is not in the @xmath12 - term .    in fig .",
    "1 we present the _ energy spectrum _ of the self - energy for several values of the brillouin zone , for @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath49-dependence of @xmath2 for @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "3 we present the @xmath49 dependence of @xmath3 for several values of the brillouin zone , for @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the density of states , @xmath52 vs @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath52 is defined as @xmath54 in all the figures we have worked with a square lattice with periodicity of @xmath55 . we conclude that the _ spectral weight _ , @xmath2 and the damping factor , @xmath3 ,",
    "do not strongly depend on @xmath49 , for small values of @xmath6 .",
    "for example , for @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath6 , @xmath2 has some @xmath49 dependence . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath3 shows a stronger @xmath49 - dependence for larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "we also note that @xmath58 in order to give a positive spectral density ( see eq.([11 ] ) ) . taking a look to the density of states , @xmath52 vs @xmath53",
    ", we see that the correlation gap opens up for @xmath59 .",
    "this is equivalent to the hubbard - iii like solution@xcite .",
    "due to our choice of the self - energy , we do not have a fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "edwards and hertz@xcite have studied the breakdown of fermi liquid theory in the hubbard model at @xmath60 . they have drawn a phase boundary between a fermi liquid and a non - fermi liquid ( @xmath61 in the paramagnetic phase ) . according to these authors for small values of @xmath14 we have a fermi liquid behavior ( metallic fermi liquid ) and for larger values of @xmath14 we have a non - fermi liquid metal . in our approach",
    "we have a non - fermi liquid behavior for any value of interaction . in order to agree with the authors of reference@xcite we have to include a @xmath62 behavior for frequencies close by to the chemical potential in addition to the single pole structure chosen in the present work .",
    "a metallic fermi to metallic non - fermi liquid behavior has been obtained by figueira , anda and nogueira@xcite .",
    "we should mention that the phase diagram of the hubbard model contains the anti - ferromagnetic transition@xcite which has not been considered here .    in short ,",
    "we have postulated a one - pole ansatz for the self - energy ( eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) ) in the moment approach of nolting@xcite .",
    "our essential new working idea with respect to the now canonical method of nolting is that we start from the self - energy while nolting proposes a two pole ansatz for the one - particle green function from the begining . in both approaches",
    "sum rules for the spectral function , @xmath20 , are imposed . as function of interaction ,",
    "we see a mott insulator - transition ( mmit ) from a metal at weak interaction ( no gap at the zero frequency ) to a well developed gap ( an insulator ) for large values of the local interaction .",
    "our formulation is not equivalent to the infinite dimension calculation of georges et al@xcite since we have included the @xmath49 - dependence of the selfenergy ( we are working in two dimensions ) .",
    "there is the calculation of figueira , anda and nogueira@xcite where the authors have also neglected the @xmath49 - dependence of @xmath23 . in particular , the authors of refs.@xcite find a kondo peak at @xmath63 . in our case ,",
    "@xmath47 , the peak - like structure seen at the chemical potential is most likely due to the van hove logarithmic singularity which always goes away with the opening of the correlation gap . with our precision@xcite , we can not conclude about the presence or not of the kondo peak .",
    "nolting himself@xcite has also studied the effect of damping on magnetism .",
    "we leave for the future the comparison with ref.@xcite where the authors discuss the use of the moment approach for interpolating @xmath23 between weak and strong interaction .",
    "we include figure 5 to present @xmath64 vs @xmath65 for fixed values of @xmath66 , for @xmath56 and a mesh of @xmath67 .",
    "it is worth looking to the band structure for @xmath68 .",
    "this curve has quasi the same structure than the band structure shown in figure 1 , for a bigger mesh ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "then , we can say that finite size effects are minimal at least with respect to the band structure calculations .",
    "( see the discussion of ref.@xcite ) . finally , we would like to say that the non fermi liquid behavior that we have in our approach ( by construction ) has nothing to do with any microscopic mechanism .",
    "our arguments rely on general grounds of a self - energy ansatz which is used in the one - particle green function to which exact sum rules ( moments ) are imposed .",
    "those interested in physical mechanisms of non - fermi liquid behavior are encouraged to take a look to the nice account presented in anderson s book@xcite .",
    "we would like to thank conicit ( project f-139 ) and the brazilian agency cnpq ( project 300705/95 - 96 ) for finantial support .",
