    "the object of study in this contribution is the two  loop integral @xmath3 with @xmath4 determining the dependence on the number , @xmath5 , of spacetime dimensions .",
    "it is clearly independent of the norm , @xmath6 , of the external momentum @xmath7 .",
    "remarkably , it has a 1440element symmetry group  @xcite , corresponding to all permutations of 6 linear combinations  @xcite of the indices @xmath8 , combined with the total reflection @xmath9 .    with parameters @xmath10 ,",
    "resulting from insertions on internal lines , the taylor expansion of @xmath11 is known  @xcite to involve multiple zeta values .",
    "the mzv @xmath12 , with weight 8 and depth 2 , appears in @xmath13 at order @xmath14 and is also present in the six  loop beta function of @xmath15 theory  @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 , with weight 11 and depth 3 , appears at order @xmath17 and in @xmath15 theory at 7 loops .    in general",
    ", we expect @xmath18loop counterterms to include mzvs of weights @xmath19 , of which the expansion of @xmath13 through order @xmath20 is to be taken as a strong diagnostic .",
    "it is one of the many scandals of our limited understanding of the analytical content of perturbative quantum field theory ( qft ) that , despite many years of intense effort , we still do not know whether mzvs suffice for even the taylor expansion of the two  loop integral  ( [ i ] ) .    here",
    "we exhibit remarkable structure in the dependence of the @xmath21 taylor coefficients through @xmath2 on the @xmath22 independent mzv structures from weight 3 to 12 .",
    "in particular , mzv structures that are imprimitive products will be generated by a process of `` pseudo  exponentiation '' whose very existence appears to me to be little short of miraculous and whose details resonate strongly both with dirk kreimer s combinatorically modified shuffle product , discussed in these proceedings , and also with the drinfeld  deligne conjecture ,",
    "namely that the grothendieck  teichmller algebra has precisely one generator of each odd degree greater than unity , and none of even degree .",
    "as don zagier observed , the drinfeld ",
    "deligne conjecture leads to an enumeration @xmath23 of * q*linearly ( i.e.  rationally ) independent mzv structures of weight @xmath24 , seeded by @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "this generates the padovan numbers @xmath27 to @xmath28 in  ( [ 46 ] ) .",
    "the filtration of products into primitives then requires @xmath29 primitives to be chosen at weight @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the perrin sequence , seeded by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the mbius function @xmath35 ensures that @xmath36 at weight @xmath37 we have the primitive @xmath38 ( which mathematicians sometimes relegate to @xmath39 ) and at each odd weight @xmath40 we have the primitive @xmath41 . that leaves us with one more primitive mzv to choose at each of the weights 8 , 10 and 11 .",
    "we might take these as @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . at weight",
    "@xmath45 we need a primitive of depth 2 , such as @xmath46 , and one of depth 4 , such as @xmath47 .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", these are entirely adequate choices of primitives , since every mzv of weight @xmath48 is expressible as a rational linear combination of products of the filtration .",
    "however , we are concerned here with qft , where more specific combinations of mzvs are found to occur in counterterms  @xcite .",
    "i shall sketch how i was led , by kreimer s fertile ideas  @xcite , and by the drinfeld ",
    "deligne conjecture , to the following set of qft primitives up to weight 12 .    1 .   at weights",
    "@xmath49 , take @xmath50 .",
    "2 .   at @xmath51 ,",
    "take @xmath52 .",
    "3 .   at @xmath53 , take @xmath54 .",
    "4 .   at @xmath55 ,",
    "take @xmath56 .",
    "5 .   at @xmath45 , take @xmath57 and the combination of _ alternating _ euler sums below .",
    "the choice of a second primitive at weight 12 is @xmath58 comprising euler sums of the form @xmath59 with alternation of sign notated by a bar above the corresponding index .    with these very specific choices , products in the taylor expansion of  ( [ i ] ) through order @xmath60 will be generated by pseudo  exponentiation .",
    "the choice of primitives which makes this possible is essentially unique .",
    "the existence of such a choice is truly remarkable .",
    "for example , the choice of primitive in  ( [ other ] ) was determined by a tiny subset of the available data , whereupon transformation to the appropriate basis reduced a file of many megabytes of tedious products of @xmath61 s to a single line of code .",
    "the key to the expansion of  ( [ i ] ) is the function  @xcite @xmath62 with a hypergeometric series of the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 , and with a ratio of products of gamma functions of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "if the propagators in two adjacent internal lines of the master two  loop diagram have unit exponents ( i.e.  no dressing by self  energy insertions ) then the recurrence relations from integration by parts may be solved in terms of two instances  @xcite of the construct  ( [ s ] ) , which solves @xmath67 in the presence of the symmetries @xmath68    moreover , the 1440fold symmetry of the master diagram enables one to reconstruct the 9th  order taylor expansion of @xmath13 , with 6 arguments , from the 11th  order expansion of @xmath69 , with only 4 arguments . if there is any new type of number , beyond the mzvs that are generated by the @xmath0expansions of pochhammer symbols in  ( [ f ] ) , then it will show up only at weights greater than 12 .",
    "the technology for developing the taylor expansion of @xmath69 through weight 11 was developed in  @xcite . at weight 12",
    "we now encounter a remarkable phenomenon : the depth4 mzv @xmath47 is primitive within the confines of the theory of mzvs , but widening the analysis to include alternating euler sums , one discovers that it may be eliminated in favour of a depth2 sum , such as @xmath70 . specifically , the combination @xmath71 is reducible to 11 weight12 terms in the mzv basis , thus showing that @xmath72 can furnish the 12th .",
    "here one sees another scandal of our limited understanding .",
    "this `` pushdown '' from depth4 mzvs to depth2 euler sums was found empirically using david bailey s implementation of helaman ferguson s pslq algorithm , which turns high precision numerical evaluations into immensely probable integer relations . in this case , the effort was infinitesimal , in comparison with the pslq investigations in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , no ",
    "one seems to have any idea of how to prove such pushdowns rigorously , apart from labouring to solve the huge complex of linear relations between @xmath73 words of 12 letters , taken from the alphabet @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 for the iterated integrals corresponding to euler sums .    in terms of cputime , it takes but a second of pslq work to find the simple coefficient @xmath77 of @xmath72 in the pushdown of @xmath47 .",
    "yet it would appear to require a huge expense of computer algebra , feasible perhaps only with jos vermaseren s form , to obtain this reduction by systematic application of the shuffle algebras of nested sums and iterated integrals in the @xmath78 alphabet  @xcite .    to develop the taylor expansion of @xmath69 to weight 12",
    ", pslq was used to find 139 such reductions of mzvs to a basis involving @xmath72 .",
    "after achieving the pushdown to depth 2 , one is left with something that seems hugely indigestible , namely the reduction of @xmath79 taylor coefficients of @xmath69 to * q*linear combinations of @xmath80 terms formed by products of primitives .",
    "the data comprises many thousands of rational numbers which are typically the ratios of 10digit integers .",
    "some reduction of this complexity is achieved by using the symmetries  ( [ sym ] ) .",
    "for example the leading term in @xmath81 is simply @xmath82 and this cancels when one combines the two instances of @xmath69 in @xmath11 . even after taking account of such obvious symmetries , several thousand product terms remain to be explained .",
    "discussion with dirk kreimer suggested that perhaps some of the tedious products of primitives might follow a pattern .",
    "the basic idea was that some simple structure might be delicately `` composed '' with an expression relatively free of such products , so that , for example , one might write @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is made of gamma functions ( and hence exponentiates a series of @xmath61 s ) , @xmath85 is far simpler than @xmath69 , and the rule of composition , denoted by @xmath86 , has the distinctive qft property of counting like objects and then modifying the ordinary process of multiplication by an appropriate symmetry factor .",
    "there was an obvious candidate for @xmath84 : the reciprocal of @xmath87 in the first term of  ( [ s ] ) , corresponding to exponentiation of @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 however it soon became clear that the powers of @xmath38 in @xmath91 can play no role in the composition @xmath92 .",
    "this seemed to chime well with the drinfeld ",
    "deligne conjecture .",
    "hence the ansatz @xmath93 was made , since it exponentiates only odd @xmath61 s .",
    "the challenge was then to find a product  free expansion of the form @xmath94 involving the 11 single sums @xmath95 , with @xmath96 $ ] , a single additional primitive mzv at each of the weights @xmath97 , and two such primitives at @xmath45 .",
    "since all 16 of these terms are present in @xmath69 , and @xmath98 does not exponentiate powers of @xmath38 , this is the minimal product ",
    "free ansatz for @xmath85 .",
    "what was far from clear is that there exists a well  defined procedure @xmath92 that can generate the remaining @xmath99 product structures in @xmath69 from the @xmath100 single  sum and primitive terms in @xmath85 .",
    "bearing in mind that a weight@xmath30 product term in @xmath69 entails all @xmath101 monomials of degree @xmath102 in 4 variables , the odds against finding a composition procedure appeared at first so overwhelming as to make such an enterprise foolish .",
    "however , following the well tried maxim that `` qft is far smarter than we are '' , i looked to see what happens when one takes the composition to be that of simple multiplication .",
    "this faithfully reproduced product terms such as @xmath103 and @xmath104 , but to dirk kreimer s great delight gave the wrong result for @xmath105 ^ 2 $ ] , whose true dependence on the 56 monomials of 5th order in 4 variables is proportional to @xmath106 yet has precisely _ half _ the coefficient that would be predicted by straightforward multiplication . in other words",
    "the composition @xmath92 must take account of symmetry factors : if @xmath107^p / p!$ ] from the exponential @xmath84 is composed with @xmath108 from the product ",
    "free expansion @xmath85 , the contribution to @xmath92 must be taken as @xmath107^{p+1}/(p+1)!$ ] . thus to generate the 165 monomials in the @xmath105",
    "^ 3 $ ] term of @xmath69 we must modify the result of naive multiplication by the factor @xmath109 .",
    "that aspect of pseudo  exponentiation had been eagerly anticipated .",
    "a second aspect came as a surprise , though in retrospect it signals that qft is in deep accord with the drinfeld ",
    "deligne conjecture .",
    "the first example occurs at weight 8 , where we know that we must include a new primitive , such as @xmath52 , in @xmath110 . to a mathematician ,",
    "such a primitive could include an arbitrary rational multiple of @xmath111 .",
    "but we seek to generate all monomials found to be multiplying @xmath111 in @xmath69 , using the composition @xmath92 .",
    "there are , at most , three sources : @xmath112 , @xmath113 and , possibly , a multiple of @xmath111 from @xmath114 .",
    "the functional dependencies on @xmath115 of all three contributions are predetermined ; we have just three rational numbers at our disposal to fit 120 monomials .",
    "a solution exists and it is unique : everything is given by @xmath113 .",
    "it appears that the qft expansion `` knows more than we do '' about the structure of mzvs .",
    "faced with a choice between @xmath112 and @xmath113 it rejects the former and takes naive multiplication as the composition rule for the latter . for good measure it tells us that the new primitive is @xmath116 , modulo @xmath117 , with _ no _ contribution from @xmath111 .",
    "note that we would get an unambiguously wrong answer were we to take the primitive as @xmath118 .",
    "the situation becomes yet more interesting at weight 10 , where @xmath119 is rejected , @xmath120 is accepted , as a plain multiplication , and the primitive is determined to be @xmath121 , modulo @xmath122 , with _ no _ possibility of @xmath123 appearing in this primitive .",
    "here one sees the monomials in the @xmath124 ^ 2 $ ] term of @xmath69 generated by the sum of two terms : @xmath125 and @xmath126 , each of which was predetermined .",
    "the former is normalized , as expected , by taking account of the factor of @xmath127 in pseudo  exponentiation ; for the latter we have only a single rational number , with which to fit 220 monomials , and the coefficient 3 in @xmath54 emerges in every case .    at weight 11 , the working out is even more impressive : @xmath105 ^ 2\\vee\\zeta(5)$ ] and @xmath128 are present , as naive multiplications ; @xmath129 is rejected ; and the primitive is given for each of the 286 monomials as the combination @xmath130 , in precise accord with analysis of subdivergence ",
    "free 7loop counterterms  @xcite .",
    "finally , qft seems to `` know more than we do '' about pushdown of depth4 mzvs to depth2 alternating euler sums at weight 12 .",
    "there still remain several hundred rational numbers to be generated by a procedure that is now unambiguous : @xmath105 ^ 3\\vee\\zeta(3)=[\\zeta(3)]^3/4 $ ] is combinatorically modified ,  la kreimer , and @xmath131 , @xmath132 , are rejected ,  la drinfeld - deligne , in favour of a pair of primitives . taking the first as @xmath133 we then determine the second , @xmath134 , modulo the first , and modulo @xmath135 .",
    "it is forced to contain all 10 of the remaining mzv structures in a basis that includes @xmath47 .",
    "moreover the coefficients of these terms have numerators of typically 10 digits .",
    "when we push @xmath47 down to depth 2 , via its empirical pslq relation to @xmath72 , some sanity emerges , since the terms in @xmath134 now involve only double sums and products of two single sums .",
    "yet still there are apparently grotesque rational coefficients .",
    "finally , we discovered that this seemingly random assortment of terms is simply given by  ( [ other ] ) , with 3 terms whose coefficients are @xmath136 , though the simplicity of @xmath137 would have been disguised had we not transformed to a product of _ alternating _ sums .",
    "it is as if qft were taunting us with our ignorance of the mapping between diagrams and numbers that results from the feynman rules .",
    "a vast quantity of data , collected by painfully inadequate methods , collapses to an amazingly simple answer .",
    "we are , physicists and mathematicians alike , stumbling on the edge of a structure that is far more refined than the clumsy methods by which we investigate it . in this particular instance , it was the sheer volume of apparently random  yet in fact gracefully proportioned  data , from many numerical instances of self  energy dressings , that led to an answer to the question posed in the title of this contribution .",
    "this work began at boston university and was continued at the erwin schrdinger institute , wien .",
    "i thank dirk kreimer for his unquenchable optimism and johannes blumlein for getting me to recount an arduous journey .",
