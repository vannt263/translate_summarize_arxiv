    "the physics of population imbalanced fermi gases in one dimension is currently attracting substantial interest since in these systems , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) counterpart of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite can be realized .",
    "this inhomogeneous superfluid state of fermions was suggested long time ago , yet its unambiguous observation in condensed matter systems has turned out to be quite challenging @xcite .",
    "ultracold atomic gases offer a perfect avenue to search for exotic pairing states such as the fflo state , due to the clean experimental conditions and the tunability of interactions and imbalance @xcite .",
    "first experiments for three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems at by ketterle and co - workers @xcite and by hulet and co - workers @xcite as well as theoretical work for 3d @xcite indicate that the chances of observing the fflo state in 3d are slim since this phase appears to be stable only in a narrow window of the bcs - bec crossover phase diagram .",
    "a promising direction to detect the fflo state is to confine atoms in 1d configurations . in this limit",
    "the fermi surface reduces to two points , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , forcing all cooper pairs to share the same wave - vector @xmath2 . for systems of fermions with attractive interactions  usually described by the hubbard model or the associated continuum model ",
    "it has indeed been shown by means of analytical and numerical techniques that any finite imbalance drives the system into the 1d fflo state , which has algebraically decaying pair - pair correlations in the s - wave channel , modulated with the fflo wavevector @xmath3 @xcite .    in the more general case of a two - channel model that also accounts for the formation of composite molecules ,",
    "the fflo phase still emerges on the bcs side in the imbalanced case , yet eventually gives room to a bose - fermi mixture phase @xcite .",
    "the fflo phase also exists in mass - imbalanced systems in 1d @xcite , which could be realized in li - k mixtures ( see ref .",
    "it should further be possible to drive the fflo state in a globally balanced mixture by using spin - dependent potentials @xcite or spin - dependent optical lattices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fflo physics has been studied in 3d arrays of coupled 1d systems @xcite , the two - leg ladder geometry @xcite , and the possibility of inhomogeneous pairing states in multi - band systems has been explored in ref .",
    "finally , we mention that the spectral function of attractively interacting fermions with spin - imbalance has been calculated and discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the simplest observables that can be measured in trapped fermi gases are the density profiles @xcite of the two spin components @xcite . on the basis of the exact bethe ansatz solution for the homogeneous system ,",
    "it has been independently predicted by hu _",
    "_ @xcite and one of the authors @xcite that the trapped gas phase - separates into two shells : a partially polarized core , and either fully paired or fully polarized wings .",
    "very recently , this theoretical prediction has been addressed and verified in an experiment with ultracold fermions in 1d wave - guides at rice @xcite .    in the case of an optical lattice ,",
    "the shell structure of spin - imbalanced fermions was studied with the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method in refs .",
    "@xcite and with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite by some of us , clear evidence for the presence of fflo correlations of the partially polarized core has been reported on systems with up to 80 fermions . in another dmrg work by tezuka and ueda @xcite ,",
    "a phase diagram for the shell structure has been proposed , with lower critical polarizations for the emergence of the fully polarized wings . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of the fully polarized wings was deduced from the presence of certain local maxima in the density difference profile in the outer regions of the trap . however , neither of these studies observed the fully paired wings , which have been seen in qmc calculations , in the continuum case @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to clarify this open point , namely the presence of fully paired wings in an optical lattice . as a result ,",
    "numerically exact dmrg simulations indeed show the existence of fully paired wings at low spin polarizations . to that end",
    "we perform large scale dmrg @xcite calculations of the 1d hubbard model with ( effectively ) up to 320 fermions in a harmonic trap , which is comparable to the particle numbers typically encountered in experiments @xcite .",
    "we carefully compare the dmrg results with those obtained starting from the exact solution of the homogeneous lattice gas , including the effect of the trap via the local density approximation ( lda ) , as previously done for the continuum case @xcite .",
    "our study unveils that the fully paired wings are present below a critical spin polarization , which we calculate as a function of effective density and interaction strength .",
    "in contrast with the continuum case , in the strong coupling regime , the fully paired wings shrink in size as the attraction strength increases . as we shall see , this effect is due to the enhanced inertia of the molecules with respect to unpaired fermions .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] , we shall introduce the model and discuss in detail how we obtain the density profiles of the trapped gas , using either dmrg simulations or lda applied to the exact equation of state for the homogeneous system .",
    "our main results are contained in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , where we compare the two methods and discuss density profiles as well as the critical polarization .",
    "our simulations are performed for the 1d hubbard model with an attractive onsite interaction @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 creates a fermion with spin @xmath7 at site @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the local density , and @xmath11 is the hopping matrix element .",
    "we define @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the lattice spacing , set to unity .",
    "the local polarization is defined as @xmath14 , the filling factor is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "analogously , we define the densities for spin up and down as @xmath18",
    ".    our main interest will be in the case of trapped fermions for which we can write the hamiltonian as @xmath19 where in the second line , @xmath20 is the trapping potential . to characterize the trapped system ,",
    "a suitable choice of variable is the total polarization @xmath21 and the effective density @xmath22 . in the following we fix the energy scale by setting @xmath23 .",
    "the density profiles of the two component fermi gas can be obtained starting from the exact bethe ansatz solution of the homogeneous system ( [ one ] ) , taking into account the effect of the trap via the local density approximation .",
    "the exact ground state energy per site @xmath24 of the gas in the thermodynamic limit is given by ( @xcite and references therein ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are spectral functions satisfying the following coupled integral equations : @xmath28 here @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "the integration limits @xmath31 are related to the total density @xmath32 and the density difference @xmath33 by the conditions @xmath34    equations ( [ energyba])-([densitiesba ] ) are only valid below unit filling , @xmath35 . for higher concentrations",
    "the ground state energy can be obtained through a particle - hole transformation @xmath36 and is given by @xmath37 . from the energies , we calculate the averaged chemical potential and the effective magnetic field : @xmath38 interpreting eq .",
    "( [ change ] ) as a change of variables , one obtains the phase diagram of the hamiltonian  , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for a specific value of the interaction @xmath39 ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "we can distinguish different phases for a low filling @xmath40 : ( i ) the vacuum ( v ) , corresponding to @xmath41 , ( ii ) the unpolarized phase ( ed ) characterized by equal densities of majority and minority fermions , ( iii ) the partially polarized phase ( pp ) , corresponding to @xmath42 ; ( iv ) the fully polarized phase with @xmath43 ( fp@xmath44 ) , and ( v ) the fully polarized phase with @xmath45 ( fp@xmath46 ) .",
    "the remaining phases at higher densities correspond to situations where at least one of the component forms a band insulator .",
    "the density profiles of the gas in a shallow trap can be calculated via the local density approximation , assuming that the system is locally homogeneous : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the chemical potential and the magnetic field at the trap center .",
    "in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ lda ] ) , we have exploited that the external potential is the same for both components , corresponding to vertical trajectories in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "the constants @xmath50 are fixed by the overall spin populations @xmath51 through the normalization conditions @xmath52 by inverting eq .",
    "( [ change ] ) we see that the normalization conditions ( [ norm ] ) can be written as @xmath53 dx $ ] , with an analogous expression for the density difference . introducing the new coordinate @xmath54 , we get @xmath55 $ ] , showing that the constants @xmath50 ( and through them , the density profiles ) are completely determined by three parameters : the effective density @xmath22 , the spin polarization @xmath56 , and the interaction strength @xmath57 .    in this article",
    "we mainly consider configurations where the core of the cloud is partially polarized , corresponding to trajectories starting from the pp phase .",
    "then , lda predicts the existence of two shell structures : a partially polarized ( pp ) core with either ( i ) fully polarized ( fp@xmath44 ) or ( ii ) fully paired ( ed ) wings ( see the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for an illustration ) . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] corresponds to the special case @xmath58 , where the pp phase extends to the edge of the cloud , in analogy with the continuum case @xcite .",
    "this yields a critical value of the spin polarization @xmath59 , separating the regime with fully paired @xmath60 from the one with fully polarized wings @xmath61 . at larger densities ,",
    "more shell structures are possible , e.g. , a band insulator of the majority spins in the center with two surrounding shells @xcite .",
    "the density profiles of the gas in the trap can be calculated to a high accuracy using the dmrg algorithm .",
    "we use a standard implementation for ground state calculations @xcite and up to @xmath62 states . occasionally , it was necessary to perform an unusually large number of sweeps ( sometimes more than 20 ) to obtain converged results . for a hamiltonian with site - dependent parameters ,",
    "it is convenient to grow the system in a linear fashion , say from the left to the right , during the warm - up part of the dmrg algorithm .",
    "the largest system size used in this work is @xmath63 sites for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 particles . in that case ,",
    "typical discarded weights in the center of the system are smaller than @xmath67 . in the two following subsection we provide details on the set - up used in the dmrg runs , such as the choice for the trapping potential and a finite - size scaling analysis .      we here consider two types of a harmonic confining potential parameterized by a constant @xmath20 , namely one that is symmetrically placed in the optical lattice [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : strap ] ) ] and one that traps particles in the left part of the chain : @xmath68 we will next show that for the purpose of studying the behavior in the wings , the symmetric eq .   and the asymmetric set - up eq .",
    "yield the same quantitative behavior .",
    "note that in the figures , we shall display the results for the symmetric trap shifted by @xmath69 lattice sites to the left with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eq : strap ] ) .",
    "the advantage of using the asymmetric trap is that it allows us to reach much lower densities and larger particle numbers without resorting to large system sizes , and at less computational costs .",
    "note that for the same trapping amplitude @xmath20 , the particle numbers in the symmetric trap eq .",
    "are twice as large as the ones in the corresponding asymmetric set - up .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the comparison between the symmetric and the asymmetric trap for the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath65 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 in the case of the symmetric trap ) for the balanced case [ @xmath72 , panel ( a ) ] and the imbalanced case [ @xmath73 , panel ( b ) ] .",
    "the open boundary that is present when we use the asymmetric set - up clearly induces strong additional oscillations in the density profile , both at @xmath72 and @xmath64 .",
    "the main point is , however , that away from the left boundary and towards the edge of the cloud , the density and polarization profiles computed from either the symmetric or the asymmetric trap coincide . in the case of @xmath64 ,",
    "the system enters the fully polarized wings at the same distance from the trap center , independently of the particle number .",
    "this justifies the use of the asymmetric trap in our analysis of the shell structure , which we shall use in the remainder of this work .      as a next step we study the finite - size scaling of the density and polarization profiles .",
    "more precisely , we increase the particle number but keep the effective density @xmath22 fixed @xcite ( the effective density is given for the _ asymmetric _ trap unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "site - dependent quantities should then be plotted versus @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the characteristic length scale for a given effective density .",
    "the results of such an analysis are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with particle numbers @xmath76 in the asymmetric trap .",
    "as expected , all curves computed for different particle numbers fall on top of each other .",
    "we further see that the amplitude of the boundary - induced oscillations becomes much weaker the larger the polarization or the larger @xmath77 is and therefore , the presence of the oscillations does not pose a problem for our analysis .",
    "in this section we will focus on @xmath66 and @xmath78 particles , with a trapping potential of @xmath79 . the change from fully paired ( ed , equal densities ) wings to fully polarized ( fp@xmath44 )",
    "wings is expected to occur at small polarizations , and we hence concentrate on @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) contains the results for @xmath81 , i.e. , the original density studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a much larger number of particles .",
    "while at @xmath82 , we still clearly observe fp wings , at @xmath83 , the local polarization practically vanishes at the edge of the cloud . therefore ,",
    "for these parameters , the critical polarization for the change in the shell structure must be @xmath84 , and further analysis shows that it is @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , if there are too few particles in the trap , say @xmath71 , then the fully paired wings are very difficult to observe since such a @xmath86 would correspond to one of the smallest possible polarizations .",
    "moreover , effects due to a finite particle number become more relevant for small @xmath77 and/or tighter traps , and lda does not necessarily quantitatively apply in this regime ( see also ref .",
    "in fact , numerically exact dmrg calculations do not yield evidence for fully paired wings at , for instance , @xmath71 and @xmath87 @xcite .    by going to half as many particles yet",
    "while keeping the trapping amplitude constant at @xmath88 and thus decreasing the effective density , the fully paired wings become better visible , as we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) for @xmath83 .",
    "there , the local polarization vanishes at a distance from the center of the trap close to @xmath89 , whereas the cloud extends up to @xmath90 . clearly , the volume of the fully paired wings increases going to a lower effective density .",
    "another way of influencing the volume of the fully paired wings is by going to smaller values of the interactions @xmath91 .",
    "the respective results for @xmath92 and the same density and particle number as in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and ( d ) for @xmath83 and @xmath82 , respectively . in this example",
    ", we find evidence for the fully paired wings at @xmath83 , while at @xmath82 , we see fully polarized wings .",
    "the fully paired wings show up as first , a region of practically vanishing local polarization and second , the double occupancy @xmath93 [ thin solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and ( d ) ] remains finite there .",
    "by contrast , whenever we enter the fully polarized wings , the double occupancy goes to zero .",
    "summarizing , so far , we have illustrated that the fully paired wings indeed show up in 1d optical lattices at small polarizations in shallow traps , similar to the case of the associated continuum model @xcite .",
    "decreasing the effective density stabilizes this shell structure in the sense that , the relative volume of the fully paired wings increases [ compare figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "next , we compare the density profiles calculated by dmrg and by lda , where the latter makes use of the exact phase diagram for the 1d hubbard model ( fig .  [ fig0 ] , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) for @xmath65 and a polarization of @xmath83 at which the wings are fully paired .",
    "the agreement between lda and dmrg is very convincing which is expected in the case of a shallow trap as considered here ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "most importantly for us here , both methods show the fully paired wings and the cloud s spatial extension for both the density and density difference agree quite well . from the figure , some known shortcomings of lda are obvious : first , lda fails to reproduce the correct decrease of the density profile at the edge of the cloud .",
    "this implies that within lda it is possible to simply define the radius of the cloud by its extension , whereas for a finite particle number this quantity fluctuates .",
    "second , the incommensurate oscillations in the density induced by the lattice are not captured by lda either @xcite .",
    "while these discrepancies are not crucially relevant to the analysis carried out here , there is another feature that is absent in the lda , namely the @xmath94 oscillation in the density difference .",
    "this is obvious since lda assumes that the gas is locally homogeneous whereas in dmrg calculations and in experiments , one deals with a finite particle number .",
    "the @xmath94 modulation is due to the fact that majority fermions reside in the nodes of the quasi - condensate @xcite , which has previously been demonstrated with dmrg @xcite .",
    "in other words , the incommensurate 1d fflo state is accompanied with a spin - density wave ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "this feature , which is visible in a trap , where the quasi - condensate is pinned , could in principle be observed in experiments with trapped two - component fermi gases @xcite .",
    "this highlights the importance of using exact numerical techniques such as dmrg and qmc that can take the trap into account exactly to complement analytical methods .",
    "nevertheless , lda combined with the _ exact _ solution of the phase diagram @xcite has been very successful in predicting the shell structures in one dimension , which for the continuum case has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we now present our theoretical predictions for the critical polarization @xmath86 associated to the change in the shell structure of the density profiles , from fully paired @xmath60 to fully polarized @xmath61 wings . for a shallow trap",
    ", this quantity depends only on the values of the interaction @xmath57 and the effective density @xmath95 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the critical polarization as a function of @xmath91 comparing dmrg ( squares ) with lda ( circles ) , for @xmath96 and two different particle numbers @xmath66 and @xmath78 . from the dmrg simulations",
    ", we estimate @xmath86 as the point at which , by visual inspection , we can clearly resolve regions in the wings with @xmath97 . due to the finite particle number ,",
    "these results carry uncertainties of @xmath98 for @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "the agreement between the dmrg results and lda is obviously very good .",
    "for @xmath100 , the critical polarization is an monotonically increasing function of the interaction , in analogy with the continuum model @xcite .",
    "however , for stronger interactions the critical polarization in a lattice reaches a maximum value and then decreases at large @xmath91 , in contrast with the continuum case @xcite .",
    "the physical explanation is that in this regime the kinetic energy of the pairs is suppressed , since their effective mass becomes increasingly large @xmath101 compared to that of single fermions @xmath102 . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy needed to break a pair is given by @xmath91 , independently of the particle density .",
    "this means that the boundary between the fully paired ( ed ) and the partially polarized phase in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ( the line connecting the points a , b , and c counterclockwise ) reduces to the dotted vertical line for @xmath103 , implying the absence of fully paired wings in a trap .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] further suggests that for the chosen parameters , the maximum critical polarizations are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "these values are smaller than the largest critical polarization @xmath106 found in the continuum model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot lda results for the critical polarization versus the effective density for different values of the interaction .",
    "we see that the polarization increases by decreasing the effective density and saturates at a maximum value of @xmath107 .",
    "then , if one sends @xmath57 to zero as well , this maximum will approach @xmath108 as is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , consistent with the findings reported for the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "in summary , we investigated the density profiles of trapped spin - imbalanced fermi gases in a 1d optical lattice .",
    "we demonstrated that , when performed on sufficiently large systems , numerically exact dmrg simulations are fully consistent with lda results . in particular , we reported numerical evidence for the fully paired wings that were predicted to exist at small polarizations @xcite .",
    "however , differently from the continuum case , we found that the upper critical polarization @xmath86 for the appearance of the fully paired wings is a non monotonic function of the interaction strength @xmath57 at a fixed filling .",
    "this behavior is a direct consequence of the increased inertia of the pairs in the strong coupling regime @xmath109 ."
