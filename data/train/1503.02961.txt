    "in the uqm for hadrons @xcite , the effects of @xmath2 sea pairs are introduced explicitly into the quark model ( qm ) via a qcd - inspired @xmath3 pair - creation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 pairs have vacuum quantum numbers and their effect on hadron observables can be added as a perturbation .",
    "this approach is a generalization of the unitarized quark model by trnqvist and zenczykowski @xcite and was also motivated by the work of geiger and isgur @xcite .    in the uqm for mesons @xcite , the meson wave function , @xmath4 ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "is written as the superposition of a zeroth order quark - antiquark configuration and a sum over the possible higher fock components , due to the creation of @xmath3 @xmath2 pairs . above threshold , this coupling to the continuum leads to open - flavor strong decays ; below threshold , it leads to virtual @xmath5 components in the meson wave function and a shift of the physical meson mass with respect to its bare mass , namely a self - energy correction .",
    "something similar was also done in the baryon sector @xcite , with the intention to extend the range of applicability of the baryon qm in its various forms @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the uqm formalism was used to calculate the mass shifts of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 bottomonium states due to the coupling to the meson - meson continuum .",
    "this was just a preliminary study , in which the bare energies were taken as free parameters and their sum with the self - energies fitted to the physical masses of the mesons of interest .",
    "there , we also calculated the probability to find the wave function of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 bottomonium states in the continuum component .",
    "the results vary between @xmath9 and @xmath10 and their smallness is due to the distance between these low - lying states and the first open - bottom decay thresholds .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the uqm was used to calculate the charmonium spectrum ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 states ) with self - energy corrections . unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , the bare energies were calculated explicitly within a potential model @xcite , thus extending the predictive power of the uqm .",
    "our results were used to discuss the nature of the @xmath13 @xcite , a meson characterized by @xmath14 quantum numbers @xcite , a very narrow width ( less than 1.2 mev @xcite ) , and a mass @xmath15 mev lower than qm predictions . according to our study",
    ", the @xmath13 can be interpreted as a @xmath16 core plus higher fock components due to the coupling to the meson - meson continuum .",
    "the problem of the mass difference between qm predictions @xcite and the experimental data for the @xmath13 was solved thanks to a downward mass shift , due to self - energy corrections .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , this calculation was extended to bottomonia and used to provide predictions for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath17 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath12 resonances ; the open - bottom decays of @xmath0 states were calculated too within the @xmath19 pair - creation model @xcite .",
    "analogously to what happens for the @xmath13 in the @xmath16 sector , threshold effects may play an important role in the @xmath1 system , discovered by atlas in 2012 @xcite , because @xmath1 mesons are very close to the first open - bottom decay thresholds .",
    "thus , to distinguish between qm and uqm interpretations for these mesons , our uqm results for the mass barycenter of the @xmath1 system were compared to those of a re - fit of godfrey and isgur s model mass formula to the most recent experimental data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the radiative transitions of @xmath1 mesons were calculated too .    in this contribution",
    ", we briefly analyze the results of refs .",

    "here , we discuss our uqm results for the spectrum of @xmath0 mesons with self energy corrections of refs .",
    "@xcite . in our calculation , we fitted @xmath20 to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the physical mass of a meson , @xmath21 , results from the sum of a bare energy term , @xmath22 , computed within godfrey and isgur s relativized qm @xcite , and a self energy correction , @xmath23 evaluated in the unquenched quark model formalism @xcite .",
    "[ fig : bottomonium - spectrum - self ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also gave results obtained by re - fitting the relativized qm mass formula @xcite to the most recent experimental data @xcite , without including continuum effects .",
    "the re - fit was necessary to compute the open - bottom strong decays , which required more precise values for the masses of the higher - lying decaying mesons , like @xmath24 states .",
    "it is interesting to notice that ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) : 1 ) below 10.5 gev , our uqm and relativized qm results are very similar ; 2 ) above 10.5 gev , an evident discrepancy emerges in the case of @xmath1 resonances @xcite , due to the vicinity of these states to the first open - bottom decay thresholds .",
    "this means that , far from thresholds , continuum effects can be ( at least partially ) re - absorbed into a redefinition of the model parameters , as also demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; close to thresholds , this is not possible anymore and continuum effects can play an important role . for example , this also happens in the case of the @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite mesons .",

    "the results are expressed in mev .",
    "the notation @xmath28 stands for the mass difference between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 resonances , @xmath31 for the mass difference between the @xmath30 and @xmath32 resonances , and so on .",

    "the @xmath33 radiative transitions were calculated according to @xcite :    [ eqn : radiative ] @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the charge of the @xmath36-quark ( in units of @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 is the fine structure constant , @xmath39 is the final photon energy , @xmath40 is the total energy of the final @xmath0 state , @xmath41 is the mass of the initial @xmath0 state , @xmath42 is a radial matrix element , which involves the initial and final radial wave functions , and the angular matrix element @xmath43 is given by @xmath44    we calculated the matrix elements of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : radiative ] ) assuming , for the initial and final states , the wave functions of godfrey and isgur s relativized qm @xcite .",
    "we gave results considering , for the masses of the decaying @xmath1 resonances , predictions from the uqm and our re - fit of the relativized qm mass formula of ref .",
    "this was done because the phase space factor of the decay strongly depends on the masses of the initial and final state mesons and our uqm and relativized qm predictions for the masses of @xmath1 states are quite different .",
    "finally , our results are reported in table [ tab : e.m .- decays - chib ] .",
    "in this contribution , we discussed the results of an uqm calculation of the bottomonium spectrum with self - energy corrections @xcite . in the uqm @xcite , the effects of @xmath2 sea pairs are introduced explicitly into the quark model ( qm ) via a qcd - inspired @xmath3 pair - creation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 pairs have vacuum quantum numbers and their effect on hadron observables can be added as a perturbation .",
    "our uqm results are similar to those of the relativized qm @xcite for the majority of states we considered , but differ substantially in the case @xmath1 mesons .",
    "this happens because @xmath1 states are very close to the first open - bottom decay thresholds , thus meson - meson continuum effects can play an important role .",
    "a comparison between uqm and relativized qm results for the mass barycenter of @xmath1 states was done but , up to now , the present experimental data do not permit to conclude which of the two interpretations is preferable . finally , we discussed our results for the open - bottom strong decay widths of @xmath0 states within the @xmath19 pair - creation model @xcite and for the radiative transitions of @xmath1 states in the qm formalism @xcite .    in refs .",
