    "recent developments in statistical physics of disordered systems have shown a remarkable convergence of themes with other disciplines such as computer science ( e.g combinatorial optimization  @xcite ) , information theory ( e.g error correcting codes  @xcite ) and discrete mathematics ( e.g. random structures  @xcite ) .",
    "while the study of a typical static measure characterizing the slow dynamics of both physical and algorithmic processes is the unifying issue in out - of - equilibrium problems , the study of the geometrical structure of ground states of spin - glass - like energy functions @xmath1 is central to the understanding of the onset of computational complexity in random combinatorial problems .",
    "the combinatorial problem of satisfying a given set of constraints is viewed in the physics framework as the problem of minimizing @xmath1 and `` ground state configurations '' , `` solutions '' or `` satisfying assignments '' should be understood as synonymous .",
    "important in an attempt of providing a complete theory of random combinatorial problems is the notion of pure states , or clusters of configurations , on which the probability measure over optimal configurations is assumed to concentrate .",
    "recently , a new class of algorithms has been proposed @xcite that have shown surprising capabilities in dealing with the ( exponential ) proliferation of clusters of metastable states and therefore in solving random instances of combinatorial problems which are difficult to solve for local search heuristics .",
    "such algorithms are based on the so called survey propagation ( sp ) equations in which indeed a decomposition of the ground states probability distribution  the gibbs measure  into an exponential number of clusters is assumed from the beginning .",
    "the sp equations can be viewed as zero temperature cavity equations  @xcite formulated for single instances at a level equivalent to the one - step of replica symmetry breaking ( 1-rsb ) scenario  @xcite .",
    "the sp algorithm consists in a message - passing technique which is closely related to another message - passing method  known as sum - product or belief propagation ( bp )  @xcite algorithm  which have shown amazing performance for solving the decoding problem  @xcite in error correcting codes based on sparse graph encodings  @xcite .    the aim of this study is to discuss the precise ( finite size ) structure of the sp equations , linking them to the bp formalism .",
    "this is a well defined mathematical issue , independent on the physical origin of the equations . due to the algorithmic relevance of both bp and sp for coding theory and combinatorial optimization",
    ", it is a basic question to understand what these equations are doing for a finite number of variables @xmath2 since this is the regime in which they are used .    as we shall see , the sp `` algorithmic '' equations at finite n are performing a very specific clustering operation over the solution space .",
    "moreover , the number of such clusters in the bethe approximation will be shown to coincide with the prediction of the cavity theory .",
    "these results will be obtained by showing that the sp equations are the bp equations for a modified combinatorial problem . by this mapping",
    "we clarify how the hypothesis making bp exact ( that is , uncorrelation of distant variables ) translate onto a condition of uncorrelation of `` frozen '' variables belonging to different clusters : sp produces a collapse of the internal structure of clusters and eliminates correlations among the unfrozen parts .",
    "we shall present the results in the case of the k - sat problem even though the method could be applied to any discrete combinatorial model defined over locally tree  like graphs .",
    "the results concerning the cluster entropy will be compared with the prediction of the 1-rsb cavity analysis for random k - sat .",
    "the line of reasoning of the paper consists in showing that the sp equations can be re - derived as sum - product or bp equations",
    " i.e. simple replica symmetric ( rs ) cavity equations  over an extended configuration space .",
    "the definition of this space consists in associating to each binary variable a new extra value `` @xmath0 '' which will correspond to the possibility that the variable is not forced to take one of the binary values @xmath3 in a given solution @xcite . we will introduce a _ local equilibrium condition _ ( lec ) cost - energy function @xmath4 derived from @xmath1 , acting over the extended space , together with a ( technical ) duality transformation needed to preserve the locality of the interactions for implementing properly the bp equations .",
    "the following two statements will hold :    _ _    * marginals given by the bp equations derived from @xmath4 coincide with the marginals given by sp on the original problem .",
    "* bethe approximation to the entropy of @xmath4 in the enlarged space as computed by bp coincides with the logarithm of the number of clusters of solutions  the so called `` complexity ''  predicted by sp on the original problem .",
    "the proof of * ( i ) * will be achieved by finding a direct connection between quantities ( `` messages '' ) propagated by the two algorithms at each iteration step .",
    "we recall that the bethe approximation to the entropy is exact over trees without and with boundary conditions , i.e. with leaf variables taking given values .    the possibility of interpreting sp as appropriate bp equations may have consequences for their rigorous probabilistic analysis , through a proper application / generalization of the known methods for the analysis of convergence of bp like equations over random graphs ( as it has already been done for problems like the random matching @xcite ) .",
    "some preliminary exact numerical results that we give in the concluding section are in support of this possibility .    throughout the paper we heavily rely on the notations of refs .",
    "@xcite for what concerns the sp equations .",
    "sp and bp ( or sum - product ) are examples of message - passing procedures . in bp",
    "the unknowns which are evaluated by iteration are the marginals over the solution space of the variables characterizing the combinatorial problem ( e.g. binary `` spin '' variables ) . according to the physical interpretation ,",
    "the quantities that are evaluated by sp are the probability distributions of local fields over the set of clusters .",
    "that is , while bp performs a `` white '' average over solutions , sp takes care of cluster to cluster fluctuations , telling us which is the probability of picking up a cluster at random and finding a given variable completely biased ( frozen ) in a certain direction  that is forced to take the same value within the cluster  or unfrozen .    in both sp or bp",
    "one assumes to know the marginals of all variables in the temporary absence of one of them and then writes the marginal probability induced on this `` cavity '' variable in absence of another third variable interacting with it ( i.e. the so called bethe lattice approximation for the problem ) .",
    "these relations define a closed set of equations for such cavity marginals that can be solved iteratively ( this fact is known as message - passing technique ) . the equations become exact if the cavity variables acting as inputs are uncorrelated .",
    "they are conjectured to be an asymptotically exact approximation over some random locally tree  like structures@xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-satisfiability problem ( @xmath5-sat ) is easily stated : given @xmath2 boolean variables each of which can be assigned the value true ( 1 ) or false ( -1 ) , and @xmath6 clauses between them , is there a sat - assignment , i.e. an assignment of the boolean variables which satisfies all constraints ?",
    "a clause takes the form of an or function of @xmath5 variables in the ensemble ( or their negations ) . a sat formula in conjunctive normal form over @xmath2 boolean variables @xmath7",
    "can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the kronecker function ( also written as @xmath11 in the rest of the paper ) and @xmath12 are the clauses encoded by the parameters @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14 if respectively @xmath15 appears in clause @xmath16 ( in boolean notation we would have @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) if the boolean variable @xmath19 ( resp .",

    "we call @xmath21 the `` energy '' of a clause",
    ". the symbol @xmath22 will denote the set of variables participating in clause @xmath16 .",
    "additionally it will be useful to use the symbol @xmath23 to denote the set of clauses depending on variable @xmath24 .",
    "the clause size @xmath25 will be denoted by @xmath26 ( @xmath27 for @xmath5-sat ) , and the variable connectivity @xmath28 will be denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "the satisfiability problem consists in determining the existence of an assignment to the boolean variables which satisfies all clauses at the same time , that is such that @xmath30 .",
    "we may write the energy function which counts the number of violated clauses as @xmath31 so that the satisfiability problem becomes finding the zero energy ground states of @xmath1 .",
    "the random version of @xmath5-sat corresponds to the case in which the variables appearing in each clause are chosen uniformly at random , and negated with probability @xmath32 . for the sake of simplicity , hereafter we concentrate mostly on the @xmath33-sat case .",
    "the energy function @xmath1 of a random @xmath33-sat formula is a spin glass model defined over a locally tree - like graph that can been studied with the techniques of statistical physics of random systems , namely the replica and cavity methods .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that a decimation algorithm based on sp equations allows to find satisfying assignments of critically constrained random @xmath33-sat instances  that is random formulas with @xmath34 just below a critical ratio @xmath35 where formulas are conjectured to become unsatisfiable with high probability  with a computational cost roughly scaling as @xmath36  @xcite while the other known algorithms typically take times that are exponential in @xmath2  @xcite . according to the cavity  or sp  analysis , in such hard region ( more precisely for @xmath37 $ ]  @xcite )",
    "there is a genuine one step rsb phase , in which the space of solution decomposes into an exponential number of clusters and where metastable states are even more numerous .    as discussed in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , one crucial feature that comes out from the sp analysis is the distinction between frozen and unfrozen variables within the different clusters and we shall introduce a formalism which naturally incorporates such phenomenon ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we want to represent the condition for a variable of being not forced to take any specific value in a given ground state ( unfrozen ) and to this end we consider configuration space of @xmath38value variables @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 .",
    "we observe that @xmath41 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : clause ] ) can be evaluated also in extended variables : it behaves as if variables with the @xmath0 value could be chosen to the best of @xmath42 or @xmath43 and thus satisfy the clause .",
    "this gives the name `` joker state '' to the value @xmath0 .",
    "for a configuration @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 call @xmath48 and introduce the constrain over @xmath49 configurations given by @xmath50 the lec formula derived from @xmath51 will be defined as @xmath52 note that @xmath53 depends only on @xmath54 and therefore preserves the `` locality '' of the structure , if any , of the original formula .",
    "a solution of the lec problem is a configuration @xmath55 such that @xmath56 . as a particular case , a solution @xmath57 such that @xmath58 is also a solution of @xmath51 .    to fix ideas it might be useful to compare the lec cost - energy function with the original 3-sat one . to this end",
    "we adopt the so  called factor graph representation  @xcite : given a formula @xmath51 , we define its associated _ factor graph _ as a bipartite undirected graph @xmath59 , having two types of nodes , and edges only between nodes of different type : * ( i ) * variable nodes , each one labeled by a variable index in @xmath60 and * ( ii ) * function nodes , each one labeled by a clause index @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "an edge @xmath63 will belong to the graph if and only if @xmath23 or equivalently @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , the factor graph representation of the random @xmath33-sat problem consists in a bipartite graph with @xmath2 variable nodes having a poisson random connectivity of mean @xmath64 and @xmath6 function nodes with energy @xmath21 of uniform connectivity @xmath33 ( a portion is shown in part ( a ) of fig.[duality ] ) .",
    "the extended lec spin glass energy function reads : @xmath65 where now @xmath66 is evaluated in the extended configuration space and @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 otherwise .",
    "the factor graph of the lec has @xmath2 additional function nodes ( the @xmath72 terms enforcing the joker condition ) that extend over the second neighbors ( inset ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ duality ] ) .    by inspecting eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) we notice a first problem , namely that we have lost the locally tree - likeness of the original graph .",
    "there are interactions terms between every ( ordered ) pair of neighbors variable nodes @xmath73 ( in the original graph ) , and thus for instance every such pair shares two constraints @xmath74 ( making an effective 2-loop ) .",
    "this introduces an obvious problem for implementing bp over this combinatorial problem , and moreover would make difficult to compare both algorithms , as the underlying geometry is now different .",
    "fortunately , there is an easy ( but unfortunately notationally somewhat involved ) way out .",
    "we will group together neighbor variables , effectively performing a sort of duality transformation over the graph .",
    "we describe the procedure explicitly below ( note that this is a particularly simple case of a kikuchi or `` generalized belief propagation''-type approximation @xcite ) .",
    "we will define : * ( i. ) * @xmath6 multi state variables each one corresponding to a tuple @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and `` centered '' on @xmath16 clauses and have ( uniform ) connectivity @xmath26 ( ( c ) in fig.[duality ] ) , and * ( ii . ) * n function nodes @xmath77 having poisson connectivity , depending on @xmath78 and enforcing both the joker state condition as well as identifying the values of the single variables @xmath79 shared by different tuples @xmath23 ( ( d ) in fig.[duality ] ) .",
    "an explicit expression of @xmath80 ( conf .",
    "( [ eq : general2 ] ) ) is @xmath81 we shall refer to the bp equations over the dual graph as _ dual bp _ ( dbp ) .",
    "( black nodes ) ( c ) duality transformation ( d ) dual graph , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "basic sp and dbp iterations can be thought of as transformations in the space of probability distributions of the signs @xmath82 of the effective fields acting on the single spin variables and of the tuples @xmath83 in the dual graph . in the cavity notation",
    "the quantities that are iterated refer to a graph in which a given node and all its neighbor nodes are temporarily eliminated ( see fig .",
    "[ duality ] ( a ) and ( d ) ) and all quantities are labeled by oriented indices of the type @xmath84 or @xmath85 where the node on the right of the arrow is the one eliminated .",
    "therefore the equations describe a local transformation of some input probability distributions into an output distribution in which a characteristic function @xmath86 eliminates contributions from those combinations of input and output fields or variables that violate some kind of local constraints ( it is worth noticing that these cavity equations are closely related to the iterative local equations of the so called objective method  @xcite of combinatorial probability ) .",
    "explicitly we have : + * dbp equations : * @xmath87 + * sp equations : *  @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 @xmath90 clauses are here evaluated in @xmath91 . + in order to show the connection between the above equations it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary transformation @xmath92 of a similar type : + * @xmath92 transformation : * @xmath93 and @xmath94 \\label{eq : tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41 terms",

    "the connection between @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be written as follows : @xmath102 where both sides of the ( functional ) equality in turn depend on some arbitrary set of probability distributions @xmath103 where @xmath104 for @xmath105 and finally @xmath106 .",
    "in short , @xmath107 in order to check the validity of the above identity we observe that a direct inspection of the composition shows that it is true if for every @xmath108 the following condition among the characteristic functions holds : @xmath109 in appendix [ proof ] we display the proof that this identity holds and , as a consequence , that also identity eq .",
    "( [ eq : equiv ] ) is valid .",
    "( [ eq : equiv ] ) in turn implies that @xmath110 where the @xmath111 exponent means composition .",
    "this in turn implies that we have a direct step - by - step connection between the elementary quantities used in the dbp equations and those used in the sp equations : convergence is obtained simultaneously and eq .",
    "( [ eq : equiv ] ) holds for the respective fixed points .",
    "it is straightforward to compute from the @xmath100 equations the marginals @xmath112 of the single variables as a marginalization of @xmath113 for some @xmath23 with respect to all other variables in the clause , ( on a fixed point , it does nt matter which @xmath23 one chooses ) .",
    "one finds that the marginals predicted by dbp are in one to one correspondence with the local fields given by sp , that is @xmath114 coincides respectively with @xmath115 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the marginals over @xmath116 given by sp / dbp acquire a computational / physical significance once we interpret what solutions of combinatorial problem defined by eq .",

    "( [ f ] ) .",
    "we will first define the hamming distance between configurations @xmath117 , @xmath118 and an ordering relation over @xmath119 configurations : if @xmath120 we say that @xmath121 iff @xmath122 implies that @xmath123 .",

    "one trivial observation about the set @xmath133 is that solutions are by force separated , in the sense that @xmath134 if @xmath135 and @xmath136 . to prove this , suppose that @xmath137 . if their difference comes because @xmath138 and @xmath123 then by force one of @xmath139 or @xmath140 is clearly violated . if on the contrary",
    ", it comes because @xmath141 and @xmath142 or viceversa , then by force both of @xmath139 and @xmath140 are violated and the only possible `` correct '' value for @xmath143 is @xmath0 .",
    "a more important observation is that every solution of @xmath144 is _ contained _ in a solution of @xmath133 with the minimal number of @xmath0 , and that solution can be easily found .",
    "take a solution @xmath145 of @xmath146 , and suppose that @xmath147 , choose a @xmath53 such that @xmath148 .",
    "it can be easily seen that by replacing @xmath19 by @xmath0 , then @xmath53 becomes @xmath43 .",
    "then we pick another violated constrain and repeat the process , until @xmath133 .",
    "we will call the resulting configuration @xmath149 ( this procedure has been already used under the name of _ whitening _ in the context of graph coloring by g. parisi in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to prove that the result of this procedure does not depend on the order in which you pick variables violating nodes @xmath53 ( the proof being that any violated @xmath53 will continue to be violated in the procedure , exactly until we switch @xmath19 to @xmath0 ) , and so @xmath149 is uniquely defined .",
    "note that two configurations @xmath150 at hamming distance @xmath151 will have @xmath152 and so every solution in a fixed connected component of the solution space will end up inside the same `` cluster '' .",
    "an example of the whitening procedure for some set of solutions is depicted in figure  ( [ whitening - good ] ) .",
    "and the set of whitened clusters in the final step @xmath153,height=75 ]    an interesting point of view is that if one tries to build from scratch a hamiltonian to describe the behaviour of the outcomes of the whitening procedure of some sat formula , eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) comes naturally .",
    "the reader should note however that the presented definition of clustering is far from perfect in the worst case : there is a number of systematic errors produced by the whitening .",
    "for instance , in figure  ( [ whitening - errors ] ) we can see one cluster claiming an uncorrectly large volume .",
    "and there is of course also another problem : unfortunately , there is no warranty that the sole solutions of @xmath133 are the ones of the whitening , and in fact small counter - examples can be easily constructed .",
    "numerical work is being done to ascertain a quantification of these two types of errors ( @xcite ) .",

    "the equivalence between the dbp marginals and the sp local field probability distributions has the direct consequence that the bethe approximation to the entropy on the dual graph , @xmath159 , coincides with the logarithm of the number of clusters of solutions predicted by sp , the so called complexity @xmath160 .    on general grounds",
    "the bethe approximation to the entropy of a problem is exact if correlations among cavity variables can be neglected ( i.e. the global joint probability distribution takes a factorized form ) .",
    "this is certainly true over tree graphs and it is conjectured to be true in some cases for locally tree - like random graphs in the limit of large size ( one informal explanation is that distance between cavity variables diverges with probability tending to one ) .",

( 18 ) in  @xcite . for computing @xmath171",

    "in this work we have shown by elementary means that the sp equations can be interpreted and derived as sum - product equations for the marginals over a modified combinatorial problem",
    ". an important consequence of this fact is a clarification of the hypothesis behind the algorithm . it is to be expected that the essential hypothesis making sum - product to work is the uncorrelation of the marginals of distant ( or cavity ) variables . under the shown mapping",
    ", this directly implies that the hypothesis behind sp ( and in a way , of its definition of clusters ) is the uncorrelation of the frozen part of distant variables , that is the uncorrelation between * different * clusters .    under this light",
    "one can think of the sp procedure of obtaining @xmath185 from @xmath1 as a way of collapsing the internal structure of pure states : the resulting problem @xmath186 has many pure states but with zero internal entropy .",
    "note that this is a completely different limit case with respect to the `` one pure state '' in which bp ( more precisely dbp ) is shown to work correctly and to predict an accurate entropy ( which we remind is the complexity of the original @xmath1 ) .",
    "as far as the connection between solutions of the modified problem and the original one is concerned , things are particularly simple over tree factor graphs ( see also @xcite for results concerning propagation of messages ) : indeed , for any fixed boundary condition ( i.e. an assignment for the leaf variables ) , there is at most one solution with @xmath187 , and it is easy to prove ( see appendix  [ tree ] ) that all solutions of @xmath188 correspond to the same connected component of the solution space ( i.e. every two solutions can be joined by a path of solutions in which successive configurations in the path differ by exactly one spin flip ) .",
    "the situation on loopy graphs ( corresponding for instance to random formulae ) is obviously more complicated .",
    "a coherent interpretation would be that not only the recursive @xmath100/@xmath101 equations themselves are accurate in a probabilistic sense ( i.e. when the factorization of the corresponding input joint probability is sound ) to compute the statistics of the ground states of @xmath4 , but also that the exactness of the interpretation of the ground states of @xmath4 in terms of clustering of the ground states of @xmath1 relies on this hypothesis being true .",
    "to this extent we mention that exact enumerations on a large number ( thousands ) of small random 3-sat formulas ( up to @xmath189 ) showed that all the zero energy configurations of @xmath4 which are stable under sp iterations can be extended to real solution of the original problem .",
    "spurious ground states ( i.e. configurations that are not extensible to real solutions ) do exist with a non negligible probability for small @xmath2 , however they turn out to be always unstable fixed points of sp , that is unsat configurations which are irrelevant for the sp marginals @xcite . while such a result was expected to hold for tree - like graphs , it is somewhat surprising to observe it numerically on small , loopy , random factor graphs . the robustness of such result calls for a finite @xmath2 probabilistic analysis which would represent a building brick for the rigorous analysis of sp ( of course",
    ", small ad - hoc counterexamples on improbable formulae can be easily constructed ) .    as a concluding remark",
    "we notice that the discussed formalism can be generalized to take care of the non - zero energy regime where not all constraints can be satisfied simultaneously ( `` frustrated '' case ) .",

    "suppose the variables are labeled in an ordering that respects distances to the root , such that the first ones are the leaves and the last one is the root . in such an ordering , the parents ( resp . child ) of @xmath24 are neighbors with labels @xmath238 ( resp .",
    "@xmath239 ) .",
    "we will fix @xmath19 iteratively : once @xmath240 for @xmath238 are fixed , all parents of @xmath209 are fixed ; then for @xmath240 there are two possibilities : either its parents force it to take a specific value , or they do nt . in the first case we chose @xmath19 to take the forced value ; in the second one we chose the value that satisfy the child clause .",
    "now we can show that @xmath237 is connected with every other solution @xmath241 ( and thus every two solution are connected ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the configurations @xmath242 defined by @xmath243 if @xmath244 and @xmath245 if @xmath246 form a path of configurations connecting @xmath237 and @xmath241 .",
    "clearly @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "also they are all solutions , since if @xmath249 is a solution , then clearly @xmath250 is also a solution : if they are different it is because @xmath251 has been chosen to satisfy the child clause ( and it was not forced from parents in @xmath252 and thus neither in @xmath253 ) .",

    ". we will build it explicitly using the so - called unit clause propagation ( ucp ) .",
    "the ucp procedure consists in removing ( in this case starting from the boundary ) every fixed variable by ( a ) removing all clauses satisfied by the variable and ( b ) removing the variable from all clauses in which it appears without satisfying the clause .",
    "( if the original tree is satisfiable , no @xmath71-clause can appear in this erasure step ) .",
    "then every possibly appearing @xmath43-clause is taken and its variable fixed in order to satisfy the clause , and the procedure starts again from the beginning until no more @xmath43-clauses show up .",
    "the resulting graph is boundary - free and with no @xmath43-clauses .",
    "the promised solution will be built by taking all variables fixed by ucp with their assigned value , and by assigning the value @xmath0 to the remaining ones .",
    "the resulting configuration @xmath257 has @xmath258 . clearly the constraints @xmath53 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : general2 ] ) ) are satisfied by @xmath257 for all @xmath24 fixed by ucp ( because they are `` frozen '' by their neighbors ) .",
    "we easily see that this partial assignement is the unique one that can give @xmath255 . using the fact that the subgraph produced by ucp has no boundary condition and that the unique solution for @xmath259 on that subgraph is the all-@xmath0 one , we see that the proposed configuration is indeed the unique solution .",
    "note also that every solution of @xmath188 will coincide with @xmath257 in the @xmath260-assigned variables of the latter , because these variables were fixed by ucp and thus are forced in every satisfying configuration .",

    "@xmath42 ) : by fixing @xmath143 and applying again ucp one can not get any contradiction ( i.e. a @xmath71-clause ) because the subgraph has no loops nor @xmath43-clauses .",
