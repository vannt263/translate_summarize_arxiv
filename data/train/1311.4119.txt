    "the presence of bautin bifurcations found in this study are consistent with the global bifurcation diagram presented in @xcite , and in fact are justified by theorem [ dtb ] .    for the kerner - kornhuser fundamental diagram we use the following parameter values : @xmath217 @xmath218      with these values one can show that there exist a unique critical point that satisfies the hypotheses @xmath41 , @xmath58 , @xmath192 of theorem [ dtb ] , given by @xmath219 and @xmath220      in figure [ diagram1 ] , we show the continuation of hopf curves from several bt points taken on the lower branch of the cuspidal curve . amid each continuation",

    "[ ell1_positive ] , the hopf points that are located below the gh  curve ( @xmath163 ) have positive lyapunov coefficient , while those located above ( @xmath164 ) have a negative exponent , therefore limit cycles which bifurcate from hopf points in this region are stable .",
    "recall that the cuspidal region is partitioned in two components @xmath173 , the upper component @xmath164 is defined by the boundaries @xmath221 of bt points and the curve @xmath159 of gh points where the first lyapunov coefficient vanishes leading to bautin bifurcations    the following analysis is performed on a particular bt point in the lower part of the cuspidal curve .",
    "a similar analysis can be done with the other bt points . starting with this particular bt point",
    ", we get a curve of hopf points passing through a gh point . by further continuation",
    ", we end up with a bt on the upper part of the cuspidal curve as it is shown in left graph of figure  [ diagram1 ] .",
    "next we take a hopf point on one side of the gh point and perform the continuation of limit cycles holding the period fixed .",
    "examples of families of cycles of fixed period in parameter space @xmath0@xmath1 , for a fixed value of @xmath39 , are shown in sections  [ section - familya ] and  [ section - familyb ]    as the initial hopf point is taken closer to the initial bt point , the period increases , in this way we obtain a nested family of curves of cycles of increasing period .",
    "these families tend towards a limiting curve which is precisely the homoclinic curve of bifurcations emerging from the initial bt point .    according to corollary  1 ,",
    "limit cycles located in the upper part of the cuspidal region are stable , while those in the lower part are unstable .",
    "a natural question is if stable limit cycles correspond to stable traveling wave solutions of the pde .    in order to explore this issue , we take two limit cycles generated as explained above , one in the stable region , the other in the unstable region , as initial conditions for the pde problem with periodic boundary conditions satisfying the condition ( [ resonance ] ) with @xmath222 , namely one  bump traveling waves .",

    "the value of the period correspond to a circuit of length @xmath227   km .",
    "the shape of some typical members of this family are shown in figure [ evolve ] left column .",
    "we took the velocity and density profiles as initial conditions for the system of pdes ( [ continuity][balance ] ) and solved it numerically . in figures",
    "[ ( ev - fam3a ) ] , [ ( ev - fam3b ) ] , [ ( ev - fam3c ) ] we show the temporal evolution for the first 50 minutes , of some member of the family , when a steady state solution of the pde has fully developed .",
    "+   +   +      family b of short period orbits are shown in figure  [ evolve ] .",
    "it was computed by continuing to a stable limit cycle a hopf point near the gh point in the stable part of the diagram .",
    "the values of the parameters of the generating hopf point of the family are : @xmath228 the period corresponds to a length of @xmath229  km ; its characteristics are shown in figure  [ evolve ] .",
    "the first lyapunov coefficient determines the stability of limit cycles emerging from a hopf bifurcation . according to proposition  [ ell1_positive ] , the stability region of limit cycles in parameter space @xmath0@xmath1 is the upper part @xmath230 in figure  [ diagram1 ] .",
    "the relationship between lyapunov stability of a limit cycle and the corresponding traveling wave solution is a delicate issue .",
    "since the dynamical system ( [ kkode ] ) is planar , from the jordan closed curve theorem , a limit cycle defines a bounded region and an unbounded region in phase space .",
    "so for example , in the case of an unbounded road with bounded boundary conditions , a limit cycle may be stable from the bounded region and unstable from the outside part ( as is the case of a saddle  node limit cycle ) , so one can not assure the existence of a _ bounded solution _ that is not completely contained in a neighborhood of the limit cycle . as another example , with the same kind of boundary conditions , if a limit cycle is unstable ( from the bounded and unbounded regions ) , the corresponding traveling wave is unstable : this follows from the poincar - bendixon theorem that guarantees the existence of a bounded solution inside the limit cycle , and from the very definition of lyapunov instability of the limit cycle .    for the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "neither instability of a limit cycle implies instability of the traveling wave , since for example an unstable limit cycle may contain in the bounded region an heteroclinic orbit connecting to a critical point , and by definition this heteroclinic does not satisfy periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the two examples of families presented in the previous sections point out to the conjecture that stable limit cycles correspond to stable traveling waves .",
    "limit cycles of family a have a long period , and so are close to a homoclinic orbit , therefore they spend a long time close to a critical point .",
    "this gives the family its sharp characteristic shown in figure  [ ( fam3 ) ] .",
    "in particular our approximation of the limit cycle in matcont reveals not to be precise enough to simulate the exact shape of the traveling wave , and therefore a short transient occurs before the complete profile develops .",
    "this is becomes evident for several member of the family in figures [ ( ev - fam3a ) ] , [ ( ev - fam3b ) ] and [ ( ev - fam3c ) ] . for family b , having short period",
    ", the numerical approximation to the limit cycle with matcont is good enough , as the initial profile at time @xmath231 is very similar to the fully developed profile .",
    "this behavior is shown in figures  [ ( ev - fam5a ) ] , [ ( ev - fam5b ) ] and [ ( ev - fam5c ) ] .",
    "multiple bump traveling waves are obtained by considering values of @xmath232 .",
    "thus for a limit cycle of minimal period @xmath211 , there is one bump traveling wave in a road of length @xmath233 and a two bump traveling wave in a road of length @xmath234 in figure  [ 2bump ] we show a two  bump traveling wave obtained by the condition ( [ resonance ] ) with @xmath235 .",
    "in this paper , we study traveling waves for the system of pde ( [ continuity ] , [ balance ] ) for the kerner  konhuser fundamental diagram by the usual reduction to a system of ode .",
    "we study the surface of critical points , and we analyzed thoroughly the cuspidal region in the parameter space @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "we find , analytically and numerically , a complex map of hopf , takens  bogdanov , bautin , homoclinics and heteroclinic bifurcations curves .",
    "this scenario is organized around a degenerate takens bogdanov point of bifurcation , according to the bifurcation diagram ( [ lips ] ) due to dumortier et al @xcite .",
    "even though , there is a considerable simplification in the solution space , the dynamical system reveals the complexity of the space of solutions , which make us expect more complexity in the case of the pde .",
    "dynamical structures of the edo system can tell us relevant things about the existence of periodic solutions in bounded domains or bounded solutions in unbounded domains .",
    "in particular , limit cycles can be related to periodic solutions .",
    "homoclinic and heteroclinic trajectories describe traveling waves that tend to an homogenous solution when @xmath236 our numerical results obtained in this work show that stable limit cycles yield stable traveling waves and viceversa .",
    "the non  linear stability is a more complicated issue which needs further study .",
    "we will write the dynamical system ( [ kkode ] ) in normal form in order to analyze its coefficients and prove that it is a degenerate takens bogdanov point .",
    "let @xmath237 and @xmath238 then system ( [ kkode ] ) is written as @xmath239 with @xmath240 .    by hopf theorem , choosing @xmath241 as the reference parameter , if @xmath242 then @xmath243 and the critical point @xmath50 has imaginary eigenvalues @xmath244 .",
    "moreover , @xmath245 thus a limit cycle bifurcates from the critical point .",
    "its stability relies on the sign of the first lyapunov coefficient which we will explicitly calculate .",
