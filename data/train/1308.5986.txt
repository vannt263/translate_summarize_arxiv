    "<S> since the earliest studies of carbon nanotube field - effect transistors ( cnt fets ) , the metal contacts have been a key factor limiting device performance . </S>",
    "<S> early contacts were invariably dominated by schottky barriers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a major breakthrough came with the fabrication of robust low - resistance contacts @xcite , although so far only for p - type contacts . </S>",

    "<S> the focus is exclusively on transmission through the barrier , with the gate serving to thin the barrier and increase tunneling . for ohmic contacts , incidental local barriers can still play some role ; but for many purposes these can be neglected , especially for thin gate oxides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then for ballistic devices , the on - state current @xmath0 is expected to be limited by `` source exhaustion '' : the maximum possible current is set by the contact doping , i.e.   the number of carriers provided by charge transfer from the metal , times their velocity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this simple dichotomy has proven adequate for general discussions , but it has never been directly confirmed by experimental measurements . even in nominally ohmic cnt fets it is difficult to distinguish source exhaustion from other effects that could cause @xmath0 to saturate with increasing gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the height of any schottky barrier is expected to vary in a simple way with metal workfunction and cnt bandgap . </S>",

    "<S> such saturation is highly undesirable , since current technology is based on current increasing smoothly with @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ figivg](c ) also shows results for a narrow cnt , @xmath44=0.8 nm , corresponding to a schottky contact . </S>",
