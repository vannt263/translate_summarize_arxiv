    "the key limiting assumptions incorporated within current hot star model atmospheres include a globally stationary and spherically symmetric stellar wind with a smooth density stratification .",
    "although these models are generally quite successful in describing the overall wind properties , there are numerous observational and theoretical studies , which indicate that hot star winds are certainly not smooth and stationary .",
    "most of the time - dependent constraints refer however to o - stars and early b supergiants ( sgs ) , while mid- and late - b candidates are currently under - represented in the sample of stars investigated to date .",
    "indeed , theoretical predictions supported by observational results ( markova and puls @xcite ) indicate that while winds in late - b sgs are significantly weaker than those in o sgs , there is no currently established reason to believe that weaker winds might be less structured than stronger ones .",
    "long - term monitoring campaign of several late - b sgs , namely hd  199478 ( markova and valchev @xcite , markova et al .",
    "@xcite ) , hd  91619 , hd  43085 and hd  96919 ( kaufer et al .",
    "@xcite , israelian et al .",
    "@xcite ) revealed the presence of photometric and wind variability of quite similar signatures in their spectra .",
    "in particular , the wind variability , as traced by h@xmath0 , is characterised by extremely strong , double - peaked emission with v / r variations and occasional episodes of strong absorption with blue- and red - shifted features indicating simultaneous mass infall and outflow .",
    "( a typical example of such behaviour is given in figure  [ hd199478 ] ) .",
    "such line signatures can not be reproduced in terms of the conventional ( i.e. non - rotating , spherically symmetric , smooth ) wind models , which instead predict profiles in absorption partly filled in by emission for sgs at this temperature regime ( markova et al .",
    "@xcite ) . subsequently , axially symmetric , disc - like envelopes ( kaufer et al .",
    "@xcite , markova and valchev @xcite ) and episodic , azimuthally extended , density enhancements in the form of co - rotating spirals rooted in the photosphere ( kaufer et al .",
    "@xcite ) or closed magnetic loops similar to those in our sun ( israelian et al .",
    "@xcite ) have been assumed to account for the peculiar behaviour of in these stars .    in general , there are at least three possible ways to break the spherically symmetric wind geometry and create large - scale winds structure around hot stars : by fast rotation , by surface structures and by large - scale , dipole magnetic fields .",
    "model calculations from the early 1990s ( e.g. bjorkman and cassinelli @xcite ) showed that @xmath1 the rotational rate of a hot star is above a given threshold determined by the ratio of its terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity , stellar rotation might converge the radiative driven wind flow towards the equator , creating a dense equatorial disc .",
    "however , observations indicate that even in fast rotating be stars , this requirement is not fulfilled .",
    "in addition , our stars are not fast rotators : their rotational speeds are a factor of 3 to 5 lower than the corresponding critical values .",
    "thus , the fast rotation hypothesis can be rejected as a possible cause for wind structures in late - b sgs .",
    "non - radial pulsations ( nrps ) and magnetic fields might equally be responsible for driving the stellar surface into regions of different properties ( fullerton et al .",
    "results of 2d hydrodinamical simulations ( cranmer and owocki @xcite ) showed that  bright / dark \" spots on the stellar surface can effectively enhance / reduce the radiative driving , leading to the formation of high / low - density , low / high - speed streams .",
    "consequently , a specific wind structure , called corotating interaction region ( cir ) structure , forms where fast material collides with slow material giving rise to travelling features in various line diagnostics ( e.g. discrete absorption components in uv resonance lines of o stars , see e.g. kaper et al .",
    "the cir scenario for the case of a  bright \" surface spot in a rotating o star is schematically illustrated in figure  [ cir ] .    concerning the four late - b sgs considering here , non - radial pulsations due to @xmath2-modes oscillations",
    "have been suggested to explain absorption @xmath3 in their spectra ( kaufer et al .",
    "@xcite , markova and valchev @xcite , markova et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this possibility is partially supported by results from recent quantitative spectral analyses , which indicate that on the hr diagram , and for parameters derived with fastwind ( puls et al .",
    "@xcite ) , these stars fall exactly in the region occupied by known variable b sgs , for which @xmath2-modes instability was suggested ( markova et al .",
    "@xcite ) . also , the photometric behaviour of some of our targets ( e.g. hd  199478 , percy et al .",
    "@xcite ) seems to be consistent with a possible origin in terms of @xmath2-mode oscillations .",
    "thus , it seems very likely that these stars are non - radial pulsators and therefore , may create , at least theoretically , wind structures via the cir scenario described above .",
    "this possibility however has to be observationally proven . in this respect ,",
    "we note that no clear evidence of any causality between photospheric and wind ( as traced by ) variability has been derived so far for any of our targets ( kaufer et al .",
    "@xcite , markova et al .",
    "@xcite ) . also , the variability patterns observed in their profiles do not give any evidence of migrating red - to - blue features , as those expected to originate from a cir structure .",
    "the possibility that magnetic fields can be responsible for the appearance of large - scale wind structures in hot stars has been supported by recent magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations .",
    "early results derived via such simulations ( babel and montmerle @xcite , donati et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicated that a co - rotating , equatorial disc can be created around _",
    "non - rotating _ , hot , main sequence stars due to a relatively weak bipolar magnetic field ( about several kgauss ) . in this model , called magnetically confined wind shock ( mcws ) model , supersonic wind - streams from the two hemispheres are magnetically confined and directed towards the magnetic equatorial plane , where they collide and produce a strong shock giving rise to x - ray emission .",
    "the mcws model has been questioned by more recent simulations ( ud - doula and owocki @xcite ) which showed that without any rotational support the material trapped within the magnetic loops would simply fall back along the field line to the loop foot - point , i.e. an infall of material in the form of dense knots , rather than an equatorial disc , would be generated .",
    "additional mhd simulations for @xmath4 hot stars with a magnetic dipole aligned to the stellar rotation axis furthermore indicated that depending on the magnetic spin - up an equatorial compression dominated by radial infall and/or outflows , with no apparent tendency to form a steady , keplerian disc , might be created ( owocki and ud - doula @xcite , ud - doula et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    due to their radiative envelopes normal ( i.e. without any chemical peculiarities ) b",
    "stars are expected to be non - magnetic objects .",
    "nonetheless , during the last decade a growing number of direct observational evidence has been derived which indicates that relatively strong , stable , large - scale dipole magnetic fields do present in some b stars ( e.g. spb , be , @xmath5 cep ) ( henrichs et al .",
    "@xcite , neiner et al .",
    "@xcite , bychkov et al .",
    "@xcite , hurbig et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    from the above",
    "outlined it appears that in , at least some , hot stars magnetic fields can be an alternative source of wind perturbations and asymmetries .",
    "and although the four late - b sgs discussed here have not been recognised so far as magnetically active stars ( except for hd  34085 , where a magnetic field of about 130@xmath620  g was detected by severny @xcite ) , the potential role of magnetic fields in these stars remains intriguing , especially because it might provide a clue to understand the puzzling problem of the simultaneous presence of red- and blue - shifted absorptions / emissions in their profiles .    to test this possibility new mhd simulations for the case of mid / late b sgs",
    "have been recently initiated .",
    "the preliminary results ( private communication , asif ud - doula ) indicate that a pure dipole magnetic field of only a few tens of gauss is required to obtain a @xmath7 equatorial compression ( with mass infall and outflow ) around a rotating star with stellar and wind properties as derived with fastwind for hd  199478 ( markova and puls @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , few hundreds _ ksec _ after the onset of the magnetic field ,",
    "the obtained density stratification in this late - b sgs model turned out to be qualitatively similar to that obtained for models with stellar and wind parameters typical for o stars and early b sgs ( see figure  [ magn_field ] ) .",
    "an obvious advantage of the model described above is that it allows to interprete , at least qualitatively , some of the peculiar characteristics of in our targets . in particular",
    ", the presence of red / blue - shifted absorptions might be explained if one assumes that , due to some reasons , the plasma in the infalling or outflowing zones of the compression or in both of them ( during the high velocity absorption episodes ) can become optically thick in the @xmath8 continuum and l@xmath9 .",
    "then , will start to behave as a resonance line , i.e. to absorb and emit line photons ( for more details see markova et al .",
    "the kinematic properties of the resulting absorption features is difficult to predict from simple qualitative considerations but it is in advance clear that these properties can not be be dominated by stellar rotation ( townsend and owocki @xcite ) .    concerning the interpretation of the peculiar emission , the situation is more complicated since such emission can originate from different parts of the envelope , under quite different physical conditions .",
    "more detailed quantitative analysis is required to check all possibilities and investigate them further ."
