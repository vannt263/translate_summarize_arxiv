    "a number of rigorous results have been recently obtained , see @xcite and references therein , showing generic ionization . however , outside perturbation theory , the systems show a very complex , and often nonintuitive behavior .",
    "the ionization fraction at a given time is not always monotonic with the field @xcite .",
    "there even exist exceptional potentials of the form @xmath10 with @xmath11 periodic and of zero average , for which ionization occurs for all small @xmath12 , while at larger fields the particle becomes confined once again @xcite . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath13 is replaced with smooth potentials @xmath14 such that @xmath15 in distributions , then ionization occurs for all @xmath12 if @xmath16 is kept fixed .",
    "numerical approaches are very delicate since one deals with the schrdinger equation in @xmath17 , as @xmath18 and artefacts such as reflections from the walls of a large box approximating the infinite domain are not easily suppressed .",
    "the mathematical study of systems in various limits is delicate and important .    in physical experiments one deals with forcing of finite effective duration , often with exponential damping",
    "this is the setting we study in the present paper , in a simple model , a delta function in one dimension , interacting with a damped time - harmonic external forcing .",
    "the equation is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the amplitude of the oscillation ; we take @xmath21 ( the analysis for other values of @xmath22 is very similar . ) the quantity of interest is the large @xmath23 behavior of @xmath24 , and in particular the survival probability @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a bounded subset of @xmath27 .    _ perturbation theory , fermi golden rule_. if @xmath22 is small enough , @xmath28 decreases exponentially on an intermediate time scale , long enough so that by the time the behavior is not exponential anymore , the survival probability is too low to be of physical interest . for all practical purposes ,",
    "if @xmath22 is small enough , the decay is exponential , following the fermi golden rule , the derivation of which can be found in most quantum mechanics textbooks ; the quantities of interest can be obtained by perturbation expansions in @xmath22 .",
    "this setting is well understood ; we mainly focus on the case where @xmath22 is not too small , a toy - model of an atom interacting with a field comparable to the binding potential .",

    "for instance , if @xmath5 , the limiting value of @xmath28 is of order @xmath32 , while with an abrupt cutoff , @xmath33 , the limiting @xmath28 is @xmath7 ( as usual , @xmath34 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus , at least for fields which are not very small , the shape of the pulse cut - off is important .",
    "even the simple system ( [ eq : eqa ] ) exhibits a highly complex behavior .",
    "we obtain a rapidly convergent expansion of the wave function and the ionization probability for any frequency and amplitude ; this can be conveniently used to calculate the wave function with rigorous bounds on errors , when the exponential decay rate is not extremely large or small , and the amplitude is not very large .",
    "for some relevant values of the parameters we plot the ionization fraction as a function of time .    we also show that for @xmath5 the equation is solvable in closed form , one of the few nontrivial integrable examples of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",

    "<S> we study the asymptotic behavior of the wave function in a simple one dimensional model of ionization by pulses , in which the time - dependent potential is of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dirac distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> we find the ionization probability in the limit @xmath2 for all @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the long pulse limit is very singular , and , for @xmath5 , the survival probability is @xmath6 , much larger than @xmath7 , the one in the abrupt transition counterpart , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the heaviside function . </S>"
