    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are compact binary systems in which a low - mass secondary ( either a main - sequence star or a subgiant ) transfers mass via roche - lobe overflow onto a black hole ( bh ) or a neutron star ( ns ) primary ( see reviews by tanaka & lewin 1995 ; van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ; white , nagase & parmar 1995 ) .",
    "sxts have highly variable luminosities .",
    "they spend most of their lifetime in a low luminosity quiescent state , but occasionally undergo dramatic outbursts during which both their optical and x - ray emission increase by several orders of magnitude ( see , e.g. , tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ; chen , shrader & livio 1997 ) .    the x - ray emission during outburst of an sxt",
    "is typically dominated by relatively soft , thermal emission from the accretion disk surrounding the compact object , while the optical emission is usually interpreted as reprocessed x - rays from the disk and/or the companion star .",
    "the new source xte  j1118 + 480 belongs to the class of sxts , but it also possesses some rather unusual characteristics .",
    "xte  j1118 + 480 was discovered on march 29 2000 with the rxte all - sky monitor as a brightening x - ray source .",
    "pointed rxte observations confirmed the presence of this high galactic latitude source ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , with a rather hard power law emission spectrum of photon index @xmath12 up to 30  kev .",
    "it was subject to rapid x - ray flares , but no pulsation was detected .",
    "retrospective asm analysis revealed that the source experienced another modest outburst in january 2000 ( remillard et al .",
    "2000 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "batse observations showed that the source is visible up to 120  kev ( wilson & mccollough 2000 ) , and a 6.2 mjy ( at 15 ghz ) variable radio counterpart was later discovered ( pooley & waldram 2000 ) .    the @xmath13 optical counterpart of xte  j1118 + 480 was found to correspond to an @xmath14 mag star in the usno catalog by uemura , kato & yamaoka ( 2000 ; see also uemura et al .",

    "the photometric modulation was later reported changing shape and period , possibly showing the development of superhumps in this source ( uemura 2000 ) .",
    "if these are normal superhumps , then the orbital period would be smaller than the photometric superhump modulation by a few percent .",
    "garcia et al . ( 2000 ) reported the first optical spectroscopic results on xte  j1118 + 480 .",

    "these observations also indicated the presence of absorption features and a very low interstellar absorption ( @xmath19 ) to the source .",
    "these authors suggested that the surprisingly low x - ray ( @xmath20  mcrab , 2 - 12  kev ) to optical ( @xmath21 ) flux ratio of xte  j1118 + 480 could be due to a nearly edge - on viewing angle .",
    "additional x - ray observations revealed the presence of a strong quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) at 0.085  hz in the x - ray lightcurve of xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "the shape of the power density spectrum and the hard emission spectrum of xte  j1118 + 480 prompted revnivtsev , sunyaev & borozdin ( 2000 ) to propose that the source is a bh transient , by analogy with other such systems .",
    "the qpo was confirmed by asca observations , which also suggest the presence of a soft component in the spectrum ( below 2  kev ) , possibly due to emission from the accretion disk in the system ( yamaoka et al .",
    "soft x - ray observations by _ chandra _ did not confirm this ( mcclintock et al . 2000 ) .",

    "thanks to the very low interstellar absorption to the source , the first euve spectrum of a bh - candidate x - ray transient was obtained ( mauche et al . 2000 ) .",
    "no periodic modulation was found in the euve data ( hynes et al .",

    "our main conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of xte  j1118 + 480 from april 7 , 2000 to july 4 , 2000 with the arc 3.5  m telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "we mostly used the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) , but spectra with the echelle spectrograph were also obtained on april 7 , 2000 .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] summarizes the dates and other characteristics of our observational campaign .",
    "most of our observations with dis were carried out with the high resolution gratings ( hereafter _ hires _ ) with a 1.5  slit ( dispersion 1.6  pixel@xmath18 in the blue , 1.1  pixel@xmath18 in the red , and a resolution of 2  pixels ) , but we also obtained spectra with the low - resolution gratings ( same slit size , dispersion 6.2  pixel@xmath18 in the blue , 7  pixel@xmath18 in the red , and a resolution of 2  pixels ; hereafter _ lowres _ ) on april 7 , 2000 .",
    "for the dis high resolution observations , the blue and red gratings were centered on slightly different wavelengths during our various nights of observations , but we generally centered the blue side to cover the h@xmath16 and heii  @xmath1 lines , and the red side to cover the h@xmath15 line .",
    "the complete list of spectral coverage for our observations can be found in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the echelle spectrograph covers the ( fixed ) wavelength range 3500 - 10000  with @xmath25 ( 10  km  s@xmath18 at 5000 ) and a resolution element of @xmath26  2.5 pixels .",
    "all the exposure times can be found in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the dis observations were reduced in the standard way using _ iraf _ and the spectra were optimally - extracted and dispersion corrected without any particular difficulty .",
    "the echelle spectra were reduced using the iraf _ ecspec _ package .",
    "direct extraction of the object spectra proved difficult for the highest ( bluest ) orders where the trace was hard to follow .",
    "we decided to use the flat field as a guide and validated the method with a standard star observed on the same night .",
    "this resulted in significantly higher s / n in the blue part of the spectrum .",
    "a total of 115 orders were extracted covering the spectral range 3500-10000 , in which the source is detected , albeit with varying sensitivity . the dispersion varied between @xmath26  0.05 / pixel to 0.1 / pixel and the usable spectral range in each order between @xmath26 70  to 150  from the blue to the red end .",
    "the emission lines in the spectrum of xte  j1118 + 480 are both broad and weak ( see below , fig .",
    "[ fig : lowres ] ) and their identification in the echelle spectra turned out to be challenging .",
    "the broad lines can cover almost half of the spectral range in one order making a continuum fit unreliable .",

    "[ fig : echha ] ) .",
    "these lines are also detectable in the individual continuum - subtracted echelle spectra . the different profile of the heii line in the _ lowres _ and echelle spectra is most probably due to the s - wave modulation discussed below .",
    "this s - wave is much less prominent in h@xmath15 .",
    "the rxte asm lightcurve of xte  j1118 + 480 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] with the dates of our spectroscopic observations indicated by dashed lines .",
    "the source was in outburst during the entire period covered by our optical observations , with a flux about 40  mcrab in the 2 - 12  kev band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "optical photometry also shows the source in outburst with a mean magnitude that decreased at most by @xmath28  mag ( from its peak value @xmath29 ) at the end of our observational program .",
    "since then , the optical and x - ray flux have decreased significantly , indicating that the source may soon enter quiescence .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowres ] shows the sum of the two dis _ lowres _ spectra obtained on april 7 , 2000 , which is also representative of other spectra of the source obtained later on during our campaign . the strong , blue power - law continuum and the weak emission lines are typical of an sxt in outburst ( see also garcia et al",
    "a power - law fit to the blue part of the spectrum yields a slope @xmath30 ( where the flux f@xmath31 ) , while a similar fit to the red part of the spectrum yields @xmath32 .",

    "we find only marginal evidence for continuum variability in xte  j1118 + 480 , both during the same night and from night to night .",
    "the lack of obvious variability is consistent with the long - term variations in the optical vsnet lightcurve ( @xmath35 0.5  mag ) , the short timescale ( @xmath3510  s ) of the large amplitude ( @xmath360.3  mag ) flickering and the low amplitude ( 0.052 mag ) of the 4  hr modulation ( patterson 2000 ) .",
    "we identify three balmer lines , three he lines and the bowen blend in our set of spectra .",
    "these are : h@xmath37 , hei  @xmath38 , the bowen blend at @xmath39 , heii  @xmath40 , h@xmath41 , hei  @xmath42 , h@xmath43 and hei  @xmath44 the lines are weak , broad and double - peaked .",
    "h@xmath16 , h@xmath45 and also the weaker hei @xmath274471.5 have double - peaked emission clearly embedded in a large absorption trough .",

    "[ fig : echha ] shows the h@xmath15 and heii line profiles in the summed echelle spectrum with the low resolution spectrum taken on the same night overplotted .",
    "we find no evidence for structures at high spectral resolution in the lines , except for an excess at rest wavelength which would not be expected in a pure double - peaked disk profile .",
    "this component also seems to be present in the high resolution dis spectra ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sumlines ] ) .",
    "the bowen blend , which is very weak in the dis _ hires _ spectra , was not detected on april 7 in either the dis _ lowres _ or the echelle spectra .",
    "measuring the lines proved difficult , not because of a lack of counts in the spectra but because of their intrinsic broadness and weakness . as a rule , we performed two - component gaussian fits to the emission lines . for h@xmath45 and",
    "h@xmath16 the two emission components were subtracted to measure the equivalent width ( ew ) and fwhm of the absorption trough .",
    "the ew of the lines varies ( with large associated errors ) within a night but we could find no periodic behaviour linked to the photometric period .",
    "we also tried to estimate the semi - amplitude velocity of the primary @xmath46 by fitting the wings of the heii line ( expected to trace the motion of the compact star ) and folding around the suspected @xmath47 of 0.17  day .",
    "this did not lead to any result as could be expected from the usually low @xmath46 of sxts ( @xmath48  km  s@xmath18 ) .",
    "the evolution of these lines during the 3 months of observations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumlines ] , after the underlying continuum was normalized to unity .",
    "when available , multiple spectra were summed up to increase the s / n of the spectra . a comparison between the most comprehensive datasets ( apr .",
    "17 and jul .",
    "4 ) , where measurement errors can be minimized , shows that the two strongest lines , h@xmath15 and heii , did not change significantly .",
    "we conclude that there do not seem to be any long term variations .",
    "the average properties of the lines are summed up in table .",
    "[ tab : lines ] ( the quoted errors are the rms of the measurements ) .    in all our spectra",
    "the blue side of the absorption troughs in h@xmath45 and h@xmath16 is less strong than the red side .",
    "the measured central wavelengths of the absorptions are redshifted compared to the rest wavelength ( which could be an artefact of the method we used to remove the double peaked emission ) .",
    "fitting a gaussian to the red part of the absorption while ignoring ( but not subtracting ) the emission lines gave higher equivalent widths ( 2.4for h@xmath45 and 2.0  for h@xmath16 ) and better agreement with the rest wavelength ( 7  redshift for both instead of 15 ) .",
    "similar absorption redshifts were reported by callanan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for gro  j0422 + 32 .",
    "a plausible explanation would be that the shifts are due to distorted line profiles .",
    "such asymetric lines are observed in dwarf novae when the disk becomes eccentric and the system shows superhumps ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "there is evidence for such superhumps in xte  j1118 + 480 ( see discussion in  4.3 ) .",
    "the heii emission may be used to obtain a crude estimate of the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) flux from the source ( e.g. patterson & raymond 1985 ) if one assumes the @xmath274686 line stems from the recombination of hei photoionized in the disk by photons with energies between 55 - 280 ev . on the other hand ,",
    "the doppler map discussed below in  3.5 shows most of the heii emission is localized and in all likelihood associated with stream - disk interaction . in this case the @xmath274686 line would be pumped by collisional excitation rather than photoionization .",
    "the following estimate therefore only yields an upper limit on the euv flux .",
    "this is still of interest since the upper limit is independent of the column density to the source .",
    "we derive from our observations @xmath49 erg  s@xmath18  @xmath50 and , from the values given by haswell et al .",
    "( 2000b ) , @xmath51 erg  s@xmath18  @xmath50 .",
    "this favours case b recombination for which one would expect @xmath52 ( seaton 1978 ) .",
    "therefore , the region is optically - thick to the ionizing flux but thin to the line and a fraction @xmath53 of the photoionized hei recombinations lead to @xmath274686 emission ( hummer & storey 1987 ) .",
    "following previous applications to soft x - ray transients ( marsh , robinson & wood 1994 ; hynes et al .",
    "1998 ) , the euv flux @xmath54 and the heii line flux @xmath55 are related through @xmath56 where @xmath15 is the fraction of euv photons intercepted by the disc while @xmath57  ev and @xmath58  ev refer to the mean energy of the photons .",
    "we have assumed @xmath59 , which may be incorrect if the euv emission is not isotropic or if we see only a fraction of the heii emission . in both cases",
    "this assumption leads to an underestimate of the true euv luminosity .",
    "observations suggest that a fraction @xmath60 of the soft x - ray flux is intercepted and reprocessed in the optical by the accretion disk in sxts ( e.g. dubus et al .",
    "1999 ) . by analogy , we take @xmath61 from which we finally derive an upper limit to the 55 - 280  ev flux of @xmath62 erg  s@xmath18  @xmath50 .",
    "this is obviously a very crude estimate .",
    "an euve spectrum was obtained for this source , the first time ever for a sxt .",
    "the source flux at these wavelengths is heavily dependent on the extinction , but the upper limit on @xmath54 derived above appears consistent with both a simple extrapolation of the optical  uv flux observed and the euve flux inferred if a value of @xmath63  @xmath50 is assumed when dereddening the euve spectrum ( mauche et al . 2000 ; hynes et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the mean peak - to - peak separation for all the observations is 18(1240 km  s@xmath18 ) for h@xmath45 , 23  ( 1470 km  s@xmath18 ) for heii , 21  ( 1300 km",

    "this discrepancy raises the possibility that the value obtained from the ca@xmath134 measurement overestimates the true value of n@xmath147 on the line of sight to the source .",
    "most likely , this would come from the conversion from ca@xmath134 to h@xmath148 which may not be `` average '' as assumed above for xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "it is also possible to measure the total @xmath149(h  i ) along the sightline towards xte  j1118 + 480 from 21  cm emission observations . using data from the leiden / dwingeloo survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) , the h  i column at ( @xmath150)=(157.5,62.0 ) is @xmath151  @xmath50 , a factor of two lower than we derive .",
    "this value represents an _ upper _ limit of course , since the 21  cm emission is integrated along the line of sight through the entire milky way .",
    "this therefore also suggests our value of @xmath149(h  i ) is over - estimated , although the dwingeloo beam size of 36@xmath152 is too large to measure higher @xmath149(h  i ) over smaller angular scales , and it remains possible that a small , dense knot of h  i with @xmath149(h  i)@xmath153  @xmath50 could be lying directly along the line of sight .    it is encouraging to see that the properties derived above for the clouds are consistent with the average properties of high latitude line - of - sights described in sembach & danks ( 1994 ) : @xmath154  @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , these authors find that , along extended sight lines at high latitude , the average number of absorbing caii clouds is 3.6  kpc@xmath18 .",
    "this indicates that xte  j1118 + 480 is located at a distance @xmath155  kpc if the line of sight to the source has average properties , an estimate which is consistent with those for other sxts . the actual distance",

    "( 2000 ) , assuming that the primary is a massive bh and that a third of the light in quiescence is provided by the m - dwarf secondary .",
    "it is also of interest to note that the 21  cm emission from the leiden / dwingeloo survey mentioned above shows two peaks in brightness temperature which correspond closely to the ca  ii components at @xmath119 and @xmath139  km  s@xmath18 .",
    "although the distance of the h  i is not known , the scale height of h  i in the milky way is @xmath158  kpc , and since the 21  cm emission arises from _ all _ the h  i in the galaxy along the sightline , xte  j1118 + 480 must be sufficiently far away so as to show the ca  ii absorption from both h  i components .",
    "this again suggests a significant distance between us and xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "an interesting feature of the spectra are the absorption troughs in @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "although rarely discussed ( see , however , soria et al . 2000 ) , these have been observed in several other transients with similar fwhm , including gro j1655 - 40 , a0620 - 00 , gs1124 - 68 , nova mus 91 , xte j2123 - 058 , xte j1859 + 226 , and especially gro j0422 + 32 which bears many similarities to xte j1118 + 480 ( see conclusion ) .",
    "this type of line profile is also seen in dwarf novae ( dn ) and nova - like ( nl ) , systems which are analogous to low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , except for a primary which is a white dwarf . typically , the spectrum of quiescent dn display strong emission lines which are gradually replaced by absorption features during the rise to outburst and vice - versa during the decay ( e.g. szkody et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "schematically , the absorption is thought to arise from the optically - thick accretion disk whilst the emission is thought to result from photoionization in a chromosphere - like optically thin region above the disk .",
    "a key feature is that the expected spectrum is inclination dependent since the absorption should disappear as the system gets closer to being edge - on due to strong line limb - darkening in the 2d disk ( see e.g. marsh & horne 1990 ; la dous 1989 ; wade & hubeny 1998 ) .",
    "there is indeed such an observed dependence in both dn and nl with the highest inclination systems showing only emission lines ( la dous 1991 ) .",
    "although the detected absorption makes it unlikely that the inclination of xte  j1118 + 4800 is very high , this constraint is weak . for instance , gro j1655 - 40 also showed balmer absorption ( soria et al .",
    "2000 ) but has a well - determined inclination of 70 .",
    "in contrast with dn and nl , irradiation heating is much stronger in sxt where it usually dominates the heat balance in the outer disk regions ( hence the optical emission , van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "energy deposited by soft x - rays easily causes a thermal inversion in the top layers where the emission lines originate ( e.g. ko & kallman 1994 ) .",
    "if the optically thin atmospheres of sxts are indeed more extended than in dn , one would expect balmer absorption not to be as common an occurence as in the non - magnetic cataclysmic variables .",
    "the spectral models of x - ray irradiated disks computed by sakhibullin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that softer irradiation leads to the disappearance of the absorption troughs . as the irradiation spectrum hardens , the x - ray photons deposit their energy in deeper disk layers , which do not contribute to the line emission .",
    "inversely , any parameter change resulting in additional heating of the disk atmosphere leads to more emission .",
    "any combination of a low inclination , low x - ray luminosity , hard x - ray spectrum or low fraction of reprocessed x - ray photons in the disk could explain the absorption troughs .",
    "those sxts in which balmer absorption has been observed have probably been guilty of one or several of the above .",
    "interestingly , in gro j0422 + 32 , the h@xmath15 and h@xmath16 lines evolved from absorption to emission within 3 days during the rise to one of the mini - outbursts ( callanan et al .",
    "although the authors could not find any evidence for increased x - ray flux between 0.5 - 10 kev , the simultaneous rise in heii emission does suggest a larger flux of soft 0.05 - 0.3  kev photons which would have a strong effect on the chromosphere .",
    "however , a hard x - ray upturn in gro j1655 - 40 was accompanied by a dramatic increase of h@xmath15 emission but also by a _ decrease _ of the heii @xmath1 flux ( shrader et al .",
    "it seems difficult to identify the dominant culprit but we propose the low x - ray flux ( see next section ) and the hard x - ray spectrum of xte  j1118 + 480 as prime suspects responsible for the absorption troughs observed .",
    "a unique characteristic of this system is the large optical to x - ray ratio , as compared to other sxts .",
    "the ratio for xte  j1118 + 480 is not dissimilar ( garcia et al .",
    "2000 ) to that found in accretion disk corona ( adc ) sources where the x - ray flux is partly hidden by the disk seen edge - on . yet",
    ", xte  j1118 + 4800 has not shown any of the typical behaviour associated with adc sources , namely x - ray dips or eclipses .",
    "in addition , our crude ` fitting ' of the peak - to - peak velocity of the balmer lines and of the velocity map rather hints at intermediate inclinations .    this high ratio might simply be due to the low absorption and proximity of the source . at the @xmath26 0.8  kpc distance implied by the caii absorption , the 2 - 10  kev x - ray flux ( @xmath161erg  s@xmath18  @xmath50 , yamaoka et al .",
    "2000 ) is such that @xmath162  erg  s@xmath18 . by analogy with the low / hard state of cyg x-1 , fender et al .",

    "this is consistent with the correlation found for other sxts between @xmath173 and @xmath164 by van paradijs & mcclintock ( 1994 ) . in other words , the optical flux of xte  j1118 + 480",
    "is roughly in agreement with what would be expected if the disk is irradiation - dominated .",
    "the agreement is less good for higher @xmath68 , the optical flux being larger than expected from the correlation .",
    "the x - ray heated companion could contribute to the optical as in , e.g. , the persistent lmxb cyg x-2 .",
    "in this case we might expect the heii emission to originate from the x - ray heated surface of the secondary .",
    "we have argued this is unlikely .",
    "a better candidate for this extra optical emission is synchrotron emission ( hynes et al .",
    "2000b ) originating in a magnetic corona ( merloni et al .",

    "the detection of superhumps ( uemura 2000 ) could add several constraints to the system parameters . according to current models ,",
    "superhumps appear when the disk can reach the 3:1 resonance radius , requiring small mass ratio @xmath175 ( warner 1995 ) . in principle",
    ", the relative difference between the superhump period and the orbital period can give an even better constraint on @xmath74 ( e.g. odonoghue & charles 1996 ) .",
    "such a small mass ratio is compatible with the constraint @xmath107 that we derived in  3.5 .",
    "in dn and nl , the origin of the optical variation could lie in the enhanced viscous dissipation modulated on the superhump period .",
    "however , these variations should be swamped in sxts where irradiation heating rather than viscous heating dominates the optical output .",
    "haswell et al . ( 2000a ) recently argued that the small change in the accretion disk area on the superhump cycle , rather than the enhanced viscous dissipation , would give the desired effect for sxts .",
    "the amplitude of the superhump would however decrease with larger inclinations .",
    "the detection of superhumps in xte  j1118 + 4800 , if confirmed , would therefore either mean the disk was not irradiation - dominated ( which is unlikely considering , e.g. , the correlated x - ray / near - uv behaviour reported by haswell et al .",
    "2000c ) or that the inclination is low enough for the variations of the area of the disk to be observable .",
    "the high galactic latitude of xte  j1118 + 480 ( @xmath176 ) is in sharp contrast with the latitudes of other lmxbs which cluster next to the galactic plane .",

    "the distribution of bh lmxbs around the galactic plane has a dispersion of @xmath179  kpc .",
    "the larger dispersion of ns lmxbs ( @xmath180  kpc ) is probably due to larger kick velocities at birth ( white & van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "whether xte  j1118 + 480 has a bh or a ns primary , its height above the galactic plane is not much larger than for other lmxbs .",
    "for instance , white & van paradijs ( 1996 ) find @xmath181  kpc for the bh nova oph 1977 .    a low metallicity environment would be supported by the low bowen to heii flux ratio @xmath182 ( table .",
    "[ tab : lines ] ) that we find ( motch & pakull 1989 ) .",
    "but the detection of n and the non - detection of c and o lines in the uv spectra has been used to argue that the matter has been cno processed in the companion ( haswell et al .",
    "2000b ) and that , from an evolutionary point of view , @xmath183  m@xmath106 is preferred to allow for an evolved secondary .",
    "considering that xte  j1118 + 480 is not extremely far from the distribution of other lmxbs above the galactic plane and that cno processing might explain the low bowen / heii flux ratio , we conclude that there is no compelling evidence for a halo origin of xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "let us first summarize the main conclusions of this work .",
    "@xmath184 the optical spectrum of xte  j1118 + 480 in outburst shows several variable broad and weak emission lines superposed on a @xmath185 continuum typical of an optically - thick accretion disk . the heii line shows a strong s - wave pattern which is consistent with the claimed 0.1708  day photometric period .",
    "we see no other obvious periodic or long - term behaviour in the lines .",
    "@xmath184 we find from the caii lines that the interstellar absorption to the source is low ( @xmath146 = 20.45 \\pm 0.2 $ ] ) and that the presence of three intervening clouds suggests a distance of @xmath186  kpc to the source . since the low bowen to heii ratio could indicate cno - processed material ( haswell et al .",
    "2000b ) rather than an intrinsically low metallicity , we conclude there is no strong evidence to support a halo origin for xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "@xmath184    we estimate an upper limit for the 0.05 - 0.3  kev source flux of @xmath187  erg  s@xmath18  @xmath50 . the dereddened euve spectrum ( using a column absorption @xmath143 \\approx 20 $ ] ; hynes et al .",
    "2000 ; mcclintock et al .",
    "2000 ) appears compatible with this value .",
    "this suggests that a significant fraction of the source flux is emitted in the euv / soft x - ray band .",
    "given the very strong dependence of the slope of the dereddened euve spectrum on @xmath188 , it may be difficult to accomodate a higher value for @xmath188 as derived from caii absorption in  3.6 .    @xmath184 the absorption in h@xmath45 , h@xmath16 and the balmer jump ( hynes et al .",
    "2000b ) , originating from the optically - thick disk , suggests that x - ray heating of the atmosphere is not as strong as in other sxts , which may be consistent with the ( very ) low x - ray flux and hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "this also disfavors very high inclinations for which limb - darkening would remove the absorption features .",
    "@xmath184 the balmer lines have peak - to - peak velocities of @xmath189  km  s@xmath18 . assuming this corresponds to the keplerian velocity of the outer disk , we use theoretical arguments on the disk size to estimate @xmath79 .",
    "we find @xmath190  ( km  s@xmath18)@xmath191 for @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath184 using the reconstructed doppler tomogram , we tentatively identify the heii s - wave with the stream - disk interaction .",
    "this gives us a second estimate of @xmath79 which , combined with the first one , restricts possible values for @xmath74 to @xmath192 .",
    "this further implies that if the primary is a ns , the system should have a high inclination ( @xmath193 ) , while for a bh primary , an intermediate inclination is preferred ( 30@xmath19450  for @xmath195 ) .",
    "superhumps ( uemura 2000 ) , if they require @xmath196 and low to intermediate inclinations ( haswell et al .",

    "2000b ) all favor an intermediate inclination system containing a bh .",
    "all of the arguments above are , however , rather uncertain and model - dependent .",
    "the assumptions made to interpret the peak - to - peak velocity and heii emission probably underestimate @xmath71 .",
