    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "features of these types are important because they show direct influences by the secondary star and the wind - wind collision region .",
    "the only clear examples have been helium lines , whose source geometry is both complex and controversial . in this paper",

    "the emission lines , by contrast , shift progressively blueward through most of the 5.5-year spectroscopic cycle .",
    "when a spectroscopic event occurs they show a more abrupt negative shift , followed by a rapid positive reversal to renew the cycle ( see mid panel of figure [ fig : fig1 ] , and figures in @xcite ) .",
    "the overall range of variation is about @xmath4 to @xmath5 km s@xmath3 .",
    "evidently these changes represent flows of highly ionized material , modulated by the secondary star . as the secondary moves in its orbit",

    "they are always present but were not discussed previously because they were weak .",
    "they are noteworthy because they depend on a form of excitation by the hot secondary star , but in different regions than the lines .",
    "they seem reasonable in some models , but are difficult to explain in others .",
    "for example , models where the helium emission originates in a small region close to the secondary star have difficulties in this respect ; see  4 below .",
    "historically , hot windy objects such as p cygni show strong emission and absorption ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since nitrogen is abundant in @xmath1 car s cno - processed wind , @xcite expressed surprise that is not more conspicuous there .",
    "some of the features discussed below were identified by @xcite , but were too weak to be noted by @xcite .",

    "fos4 is a position in the se lobe of the homunculus ( about 4 southeast of the star ) which reflects the star s polar spectrum while the spectrum in direct view is representative of lower latitudes . the spectral resolution was about 1.2  or 65 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the seeing varied from 0.5 to 1.5 , so each gmos spectrum represents a region typically @xmath10 1 across .",
    "we prepared 2-d spectrograms with the standard gmos data reduction pipeline in the gemini iraf package and extracted 1-d spectra .",
    "the pipeline wavelength calibration was improved using the interstellar absorption line at @xmath85782  ; in this paper we use heliocentric vacuum velocities .",
    "further details , unimportant for this paper , will be listed in a later publication ( mehner et al .",

    "eta car was observed with the hubble space telescope space telescope imaging spectrograph ( _ hst _ stis ) from 1998 to 2004 and then again starting in 2009 .",
    "here we only use observations with the g750 m grating , the 52@xmath110.1 slit , and central wavelength @xmath85734  .",
    "the spectral resolution was about 1.1  or 60 km s@xmath3 .",

    "the maximum strength of the absorption component has a radial velocity of about @xmath6 km s@xmath3 with respect to the emission peak . during the 2009 spectroscopic event , emission and absorption features shifted about @xmath20 km s@xmath3 towards the blue , simultaneous with the emission and absorption lines and the @xmath19 emission .",
    "_ hst _ stis data obtained in 2009 june and december clearly show the @xmath056685712 lines , see figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "in retrospect the faint spectral features can also be detected in _",
    "stis data from 19982004 , but due to lower s / n they failed to attract notice before .",
    "like the absorption , absorption was much weaker before 2003 ; less than 30% compared to 2009 ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption strengths of both species increased gradually over the last 10 years except during the 2003.5 and 2009.0 spectroscopic events .",
    "we determined the `` stellar continuum '' by a loess ( locally weighted scatterplot smoothing ) fit to the spectrum and find that the absorption is stronger than the emission .",
    "( the same is true for p cygni ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "_ gemini _ gmos data appear to indicate the opposite , but their data quality is too low to determine a reliable continuum , and ground - based spectra are contaminated by narrow emission lines from ejecta outside the wind , e.g. , [ ] @xmath85675 blends with the @xmath05678,5681 absorption .",
    "although we first noticed these features in gmos data , the high spatial resolution of _ hst _ data is essential for examining their character .",
    "most other permitted lines are too weak or blended with emission lines from the wind or nearby ejecta to be observed .",
    "however , we see similar behavior in the @xmath16 @xmath13p@xmath14  @xmath21 @xmath13p series at @xmath04603,4608   ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",

    "the @xmath23 levels are excited in the same way but lead to no observable results .",
    "transitions from @xmath23 @xmath13s@xmath17 to @xmath24 ( @xmath064357265  ) have small oscillator strengths and are therefore not observed .",
    "stis data indicates the weak presence of the singlet @xmath83996 line but this line is blended with others in _ gemini _ data and therefore the identification is not certain .",
    "lines whose upper levels are above the @xmath21 state like @xmath85007 , even though they are strong in the laboratory , are not observed .",
    "the lines and their velocity shifts can also be seen in the reflected polar spectrum at location fos4 , the location decribed in  2 .",
    "the velocity shifts from the fos4 separate direction may cast doubt on orbit models , but this question is too complex to discuss here .",
    "the same lines are seen in early type stars . in objects like p cygni and shells of o - stars , @xmath25 @xmath26p@xmath17  @xmath27 @xmath26s,@xmath26p,@xmath26d and @xmath25 @xmath13p@xmath17 ",
    "@xmath27 @xmath13s,@xmath13p,@xmath13d are very strong @xcite .",
    "large differences between wn stars indicate that these lines are sensitive to atmospheric conditions and/or the variability of the wind",
    ". they may also be very sensitive to the fuv flux since they are likely produced via continuum fluorescence @xcite .    in the case of @xmath1 car",
    "the absorption and emission almost certainly occur in the primary star s dense wind , for reasons noted later below .",
    "but three facts indicate that uv photons from the secondary star populate the critical @xmath25 level .",
    "( 1 ) the velocity behavior described in  3 strongly suggests some relation to the secondary , analogous to the features .",
    "( 2 ) the @xmath25 levels are about 18.5 ev above the ground state , a high value for the primary star s wind . according to @xcite",
    ", the opaque - wind photospheric temperature is below @xmath28 k and emission - line regions in the primary wind are mostly below @xmath29 k ; much cooler than the o stars and wr objects mentioned above . the hot secondary star , on the other hand , produces a large flux of 18.5 ev photons ( fig .  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "( 3 ) this hypothesis appears quantitatively successful as outlined below .",
    "any of these clues by itself might be debatable , but together they seem compelling to us .",
    "let us summarize an order - of - magnitude assessment of the absorption line strengths that one would expect in a simple model . for simplicity",
    "we include only the n@xmath30 ground level ` 1 ' ( @xmath31 @xmath13p ) and one excited level ` 2 ' ( @xmath16 @xmath13p@xmath17 ) ; our initial goal is to estimate the equilibrium population ratio @xmath32 .",
    "a two - level system is justified because no permitted transitions connect level 2 to intermediate levels .",
    "consider a uniformly - expanding local volume in the primary wind .",
    "denote the incident continuum photon flux at @xmath33 ev by @xmath34 , not corrected for line absorption in the gas . as explained in  8.5 in @xcite and  8 in @xcite ,",
    "the sobolev approximation allows us to write expressions for the radiative @xmath35 excitation rate and the re - emission photon escape probability , as functions of the local expansion rate , a line profile function , and atomic parameters .",
    "the _ effective _ de - excitation rate is proportional to the escape probability , and the most complicated factors appear similarly in both the excitation rate and the escape probability .",
    "consequently the equilibrium population ratio is simple : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the statistical weights .",
    "this expression remains valid when we take fine structure into account .",
    "the same ratio would be found in an lte case where @xmath39 is the planckian photon density at @xmath33 ev .",
    "above we mentioned triplet levels of , but singlet levels would also be excited in the same way from @xmath31 @xmath26d .    with conventional parameters for the two stars and their winds , @xmath34 at 18.5 ev",
    "is dominated by the hot secondary star .",
    "reasonable values for it are @xmath40 k , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite . according to a wm - basic atmosphere model , such an object emits roughly @xmath43 photons hz@xmath3 s@xmath3 at @xmath44 ev , about 30% less than a @xmath45 k blackbody .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the probable geometry . with the type of orbit model that most authors currently favor ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the separation between stars was about 13 au when @xmath1 car was observed in 2009 june .",
    "the secondary star was then located roughly 15 au closer to us than the primary , and roughly 10 au from our line of sight to the primary  depending on the poorly known orbit orientation , of course . with these parameters ,",
    "1 gives @xmath46 at relevant locations between us and the primary star , i.e. , in gas located about 10 au from the secondary star .",
    "the equivalent excitation temperature is near @xmath47 k.    the observed absorption lines have some geometrical complications",
    ". since the opaque - wind photosphere is diffuse with a substantial size , a relevant `` line of sight '' can be any sample ray in a cylinder with diameter @xmath10 7 au ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "strong @xmath25@xmath27 absorption occurs in regions that optimize a combination of attributes : ( 1 ) the inner wind is favored because of its high densities ; ( 2 ) most of the nitrogen must be singly ionized ; ( 3 ) the n@xmath30 must be fairly close to the secondary star in order to maximize @xmath48 ; and ( 4 ) the light path ( possibly indirect , due to thomson scattering ) must pass close enough to the primary star to sample continuum radiation from its semi - opaque inner wind .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we expect the strongest absorption to occur near and above the symbol ` 1 ' that labels region 1 .",
    "the picture obviously changes as the secondary star moves along its orbit .",
    "most nitrogen in the primary wind is singly ionized , due to both the primary and the secondary radiation field @xcite .",
    "helium in zones 3 and 4 of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] provides the shielding which prevents the secondary radiation field from ionizing n@xmath49 into n@xmath50 , but which allows the 18.5 ev radiation to penetrate .",
    "suppose the primary mass - loss rate is @xmath51 @xmath52 yr@xmath3 and nearly all the cno is nitrogen @xcite .",
    "car is around @xmath53 @xmath54 yr@xmath3 , but there are good reasons to believe that it has decreased substantially in the past decade @xcite .",
    "] then the column densities outside @xmath55 au ( for example ) are @xmath56 @xmath57 this column density would produce a combined equivalent width of about 1  for the @xmath85681.14 and @xmath85677.60   absorption lines .",
    "since this exceeds the observed value of 0.5  , _ the proposed mechanism appears to be sufficient , _ even if only a limited part of the wind is involved .",
    "let us emphasize that the parameter values in this sample calculation were chosen _",
    "ab initio _ without knowing what result they would lead to ; there was no readjustment to get a desired outcome .",
    "note that the margin of error does not allow much smaller values of @xmath34 and gas densities .",
    "the _ emission _ features reported in  3 are comparable in strength to the absorption  probably weaker and certainly not much stronger ",
    "so they resemble the pure scattering case of p cyg lines . in other words , the observed @xmath25 ",
    "@xmath27 emission line strengths automatically resemble the absorption strengths .",
    "more detailed calculations will require elaborate geometrical models of the ionization and excitation zones .    as we noted earlier",
    ", these features should arise chiefly in regions of the primary wind that are fairly close to the secondary star , and , therefore , close to the he@xmath30 zones and wind - wind shocks .",
    "if shock instabilities do not distort it too much , the he@xmath49/he@xmath58 ionization front is expected to have a pseudo - hyperboloidal shape that may be either concave or convex towards the secondary star ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "adjoining primary - wind zones are spatially large enough to account for the lines .",
    "generically , this type of model can explain the velocity variations , but authors disagree about details ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "far more important than merely being consistent with some models of the @xmath1 car system , the features may disprove others .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that the helium lines originate in the acceleration zone of the secondary star s wind , or perhaps in an accretion disk around the secondary , rather than in the primary wind @xcite .",
    "but the features , with practically the same velocity behavior , almost certainly can not represent such zones ; so models of that type would be forced to explain the and velocities differently .",
    "the arguments are simplest for absorption lines .",
    "first we note that with credible parameters for the two stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the primary wind accounts for at least 95% of the visual - wavelength continuum , most likely 9899% .",
    "therefore _ the absorption features in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] definitely represent material located between us and the inner parts of the primary wind . _",
    "( in other words , blocking the entire secondary star would not produce absorption as deep as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , even if @xmath59 . )",
    "can this absorbing material be part of the secondary wind or an accretion disk of the secondary star ?",
    "presumably not ; because in every proposed orbit model the relevant lines of sight either miss the secondary star and its wind entirely at most times , or pass through only the outskirts of the secondary wind",
    ". gas densities in the secondary wind are two orders of magnitude less than we used in the calculations outlined above , the nitrogen is mainly , and the velocity dispersion is too large for the observed absorption features .",
    "this type of model would badly fail the quantitative feasibility test that the `` conventional '' model passed .",
    "regarding the emission features , they are fairly weak relative to the total observed continuum , but would be extraordinarily strong compared to the visual - wavelength continuum of just the secondary star .",
    "developing these arguments further would be beyond the scope of this paper ; our main point is that _ the lines convey information that is not available in other spectral features .",
    "_ this is mainly because they arise in `` normal '' parts of the primary wind",
    "but they are sensitive to the current location of the secondary star .",
    "helium lines also depend on uv from the secondary , but their emission zones are extremely difficult to model since they depend on the unstable primary shock , post - shock cooling , local `` clumping , '' etc . in principle the n ii zones are expected to be much steadier , and the excitation mechanism is relatively insensitive to inhomogeneities . for these reasons",
    "the features may be good indicators of average density in the wind combined with the secondary star s orbital motion .",
    "in particular one might expect their velocities to be easier to model than those of helium lines .",
    "if the `` conventional '' model is more or less valid , then the absorption features should weaken around apastron when @xmath48 is smallest .",
    "unfortunately the 20002002 _ hst _ stis data ( the only previous apastron passage when stis was available ) are not adequate to test this `` prediction '' easily .",
    "perhaps new stis observations will be made in 20112012 .    in  3",
    "we mentioned that and absorption lines have grown in strength during the past 10 years . at first sight",
    "this appears counter - intuitive , since the wind density appears to have _ decreased _",
    "however , the situation has various dependencies that tend to oppose each other so intuition may be a poor guide .",
    "decreasing mass loss rate implies a smaller , denser opaque - wind photosphere ; eqn .",
    "1 becomes invalid if continuum absorption destroys the trapped 18.5 ev resonance photons before they escape ; etc .",
    "this problem merits further attention . as the wind decreases it",
    "is conceivable that the primary star may eventually become hot enough to excite these lines in addition to the secondary .",
    "whatever the solution , we expect the lines to provide different parameter contraints than the spectral features that are excited in more normal ways .      1 .   the `` normal '' lines of hydrogen , , etc . in principle these can be used to analyze the primary wind @xcite .",
    "2 .   emission and absorption .",
    "most authors agree that these are related in some way to the secondary star , but the details are controversial ( see references cited in  1 above ) .",
    "3 .   emission and absorption .",
    "these lines arise in normal - ionization parts of the primary wind , but they depend mainly on the proximity of the secondary star .",
    "in this sense they sample a new region of parameter space . in most recent models ,",
    "the zones are much simpler than the ionized helium .",
    "we emphasize that the lines depend on photoionization , @xmath60 ev , whereas the lines depend on photoexcitation at @xmath61 ev . the ratio @xmath62 depends strongly on the secondary star s temperature ( wm - basic atmosphere models , ) .",
    "@xmath84687 , an unsolved puzzle not discussed here .",
    "it depends on soft x - rays from the colliding - wind region , not uv from the secondary star .    a good basic model for",
    "the primary wind and the binary system must account for at least the first three of these , throughout most of the 5.5-year cycle .",
    "( @xmath84687 may depend on shock instabilities too complex for a `` basic '' model . )    after an earlier version of this paper appeared on astro - ph , @xcite have proposed an alternative interpretation of the lines .",
    "a full response would make this paper too long , but in our view they do not explain how gas in a very small locale near the secondary star can produce substantial absorption lines in the spectrum of the much larger primary - wind photosphere ( see discussion above ) .",
