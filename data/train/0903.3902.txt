    "despite the widespread using of game theory @xcite in social sciences , its range of applications remains disputable .",
    "the question , to what extent people are rational in their decisions , created a rich set of research points of view , including the concept of evolutionary thinking @xcite .",
    "axelrod discussed this question in terms of the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) , a famous thought experiment which demostrates that according to game theory in many situations a cooperation is not rational .",
    "then , pd become a common method of real and computational experiments . to complete",
    "the list of references is beyond our chance and aim ; we refer to @xcite .",
    "although the formulation of pd relies on the concepts of payoffs and rational choice , some recent experiments exceed this frame . in 2006",
    "de cremer and stouten showed @xcite that the conditions of cooperation are trust and some common goal to achieve ; the latter was measured with the inclusion of other with the self scale @xcite . in the same year the results of mulder et al .",
    "@xcite indicated that sanctioning defection itself can weaken the motivation of players to cooperate .",
    "these results , obtained within the scheme of the public good experiment @xcite , show that a reliable theory of cooperation can not be limited to the assumption of an idividual and selfish rationality , but it should include some collectivistic attitudes , as for example preserving of social norms .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from the results of the ultimatum game , when played by members of different societies @xcite .",
    "+ here we are interested in a contribution of cooperation to the process of the formation of social groups .",
    "although in a society this process usually runs in a longer timescale than a standard experiment , some information could be drawn from a search of cooperation in already established groups .",
    "here however , the outcome varies strongly from one particular case to another .",
    "sometimes boundaries between groups seem to disappear , as those reported in @xcite between japanese and american students in hokkaido .",
    "the data collected in bosnia and north causasus indicate , that the likelihood of intergroup trust and cooperation depends more on cultural and economic status than on personal - often crude - experience @xcite .",
    "in other cases , as the one with australian and singaporean students @xcite , the results are less conclusive .",
    "the difference in timescale , noted above , was to some extent evaded in the pd experiment performed by goette et al . @xcite .",
    "the groups investigated there were platoons of males formed for four - week period of officer training in the swiss army .",
    "as individuals were randomly assigned to different platoons , the experiment was free from the confounding effect of self - selection into groups .",
    "the intra - group cooperation was found to be clearly stronger than the inter - group one .",
    "also , individuals believed that members of their own platoons were more willing to cooperate .",
    "these results are closely akin to those of @xcite .",
    "+ recently we proposed a new model of cooperation , formulated without use of the concepts of payoff and utility @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the only model variables were reputations and altruisms of individual players .",
    "both these variables entered to the expression of the probability of cooperation of one player with another .",
    "the only difference between the variables was their time dependence ; while the reputation varied in each game , the level of altruism remained constant .",
    "the aim of this work is to apply the same model to the intra- and inter - group cooperation .",
    "accordingly , we are going to admit that the reputation and the altruism can be different within the group and between the groups . + the paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section is devoted to the model , as formulated in @xcite , and to a brief conclusion of its results for one group . in the same section",
    "we explain how the model is generalized to the case of two groups . in section 3",
    "we report the way how the group structure is investigated ; here we base on methods of @xcite .",
    "numerical results are described in section 4 and discussed in section 5 .",
    "the game is performed between @xmath4 agents placed at nodes of a fully connected graph . to each agent ,",
    "two parameters are assigned : reputation @xmath5 and altruism @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . the altruisms @xmath6 are random numbers from the homogeneous distribution on the range @xmath8 , and these values remain constant during the game .",
    "initial values of the reputations @xmath9 .",
    "once an agent cooperates , hers / his reputation is transformed as @xmath10 ; otherwise @xmath11 .",
    "at each time step a pair of agents @xmath12 is selected randomly from the whole set .",
    "the probability @xmath13 that @xmath1 cooperates with @xmath2 is calculated as the fractional part of @xmath14 ; once this outcome is negative , @xmath13 is set to zero , once it is larger than 1 , @xmath13 is set to 1 @xcite .",
    "+    the most important result of the model is presented in fig .",
    "1 . what is shown there are frequencies of four situations met by an agent @xmath1 against the time average of the reputation @xmath15 .",
    "the situations are : 1 .",
    "both @xmath1 and his partner cooperate , with the outcome r ; 2 . both @xmath1 and",
    "his partner defects , with the outcome u ; 3 .",
    "@xmath1 cooperates but his partner defects , with the outcome s ; 4 .",
    "@xmath1 defects but his partner cooperates , with the outcome t. as we see in fig .",
    "1 , for agents with positive mean reputation @xmath16 the mutual cooperation is most frequent . on the contrary ,",
    "agents with negative mean reputation @xmath17 defect in most cases : same do their partners .",
    "a similar plot was shown in @xcite , with the difference that there , the altruism @xmath18 was used in the horizontal axis .",
    "we note that if we use the a temporary value of reputation @xmath5 and not its time average @xmath15 , the plot is so noisy that it is hard to see anything @xcite .",
    "to investigate the group formation , here we divide the whole set of @xmath4 nodes into two halves , each of @xmath19 nodes and we introduce an additional bias parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the role of @xmath20 is to enhance the intra - group cooperation and to weaken the inter - group one . with this purpose in mind , we apply the bias in two alternative ways : @xmath21 by adding @xmath20 to the initial values of reputations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 if these nodes belong to the same group , and by reducing the initial values of reputations if @xmath1 and @xmath2 belong to different groups . for each @xmath1 , this change of reputation @xmath5 is done only once , when @xmath1 plays for the first time .",
    "@xmath22 by a similar increase ( reduction ) of attitudes @xmath23 by @xmath20 when @xmath24 are in the same ( different ) groups .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 varies from zero to 0.3 .",
    "the object to investigate now is the matrix @xmath0 which measures the frequency of cooperation of each two agents @xmath24 .",
    "this matrix contains an information of a possible cluster structure of our network .",
    "here we investigate it by two methods : the newman algorithm ( nm ) @xcite and our recent method by means of differential equations ( df ) @xcite .",
    "as all other methods designed for an identification the cluster structure @xcite , these two methods have to extract this structure from an initial noised information .",
    "+ the newman algorithm is based on the time evolution of modularity @xmath25 - a quantity which measures the departure of the actual graph structure from a random one .",
    "the formula is @xcite    @xmath26\\delta(c_i , c_j)\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 if @xmath24 belong to the same cluster ; otherwise @xmath30 .",
    "we start from all @xmath4 nodes separated and we add links as to get maximal possible value of @xmath25 at each step .",
    "we accept the obtained cluster structure at the moment when @xmath25 is maximal . for a more detailed description",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "+ our algorithm with differential equations relies also on the modularity @xmath25 , but the time dependence of the connectivity matrix @xmath31 is given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 for @xmath34 and 1 in the opposite , and @xmath35 is a parameter .",
    "our former numerical results suggest that the formalism works well if @xmath36 . here , the frequency matrix elements @xmath0 serve as initial values of @xmath37 .",
    "again , we break the time evolution at the moment when @xmath25 gets its maximal value .",
    "the detailed description is given in @xcite .",
    "calculations are performed for @xmath4=300 nodes , i.e. for the frequency matrix @xmath38 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 , initially equal to zero , increases and reaches its stationary value about 0.06 after @xmath39 games .",
    "all the results are then gathered after this transient time . as a rule ,",
    "@xmath40 games are played .",
    "the frequency matrix was obtained for both methods of using @xmath20 to modify the initial reputation @xmath5 or the altruism @xmath6 . for each of these methods and for the system of @xmath41 nodes we got four frequency matrices",
    "@xmath0 for @xmath20= 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 .",
    "these matrices can be used to produce the plots like our fig .",
    "1 . there are only slight differences between these plots made for @xmath20=0.0 and 0.3 .",
    "+ for both ways of using the bias @xmath20 , i.e. with modified reputation or altruism , nm gives the same results .",
    "this method gives always two clusters .",
    "for @xmath42 , their sizes are : 162 nodes , with mean @xmath18= -0.113 , and 138 nodes with mean @xmath18= 0.126 .",
    "this could mean that the partition is roughly into defecting and cooperating agents .",
    "however , for @xmath20=0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 the newman algorithm reproduces exactly the division of the network into two groups which were meant to cooperate by using the probabilities @xmath13 with the preferences done by @xmath20 . in these groups ,",
    "mean values of @xmath18 are close to zero .",
    "+    the results of df @xcite are different . in the case",
    "when the initial reputations @xmath5 are modified , we have one cluster : there is no partition .",
    "when the altruisms @xmath6 are modified , for @xmath20= 0.0 , 0.1 and 0.2 and the parameter @xmath43 again there is no partition . for @xmath20= 0.3 and",
    "all used values of @xmath35 ( from 0.1 to 1.0 ) we get two clusters , with their sizes varying between 69 and 78 nodes ; however , the size difference was not larger than 4 nodes .",
    "the obtained structure is visualised in fig .",
    "the altruism parameter @xmath18 averaged over each of those clusters , varied between 0.25 and 0.29 .",
    "as we see , this partition captures cooperating agents in two groups .",
    "we deduce it from the mean values of @xmath18 for the clusters and from if their size . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we could expect the size to be @xmath44 and the mean altruism parameters to be 0.25 .",
    "these limit values are close to those obtained in our simulation .",
    "our question was , if the proposed model can account for the preference of cooperation within groups .",
    "the criterion designed here is , if the cooperation pattern , encoded in the frequency matrix @xmath45 , is detectable as the structure of communities in the network . both for the newman algorithm @xcite and for our method",
    "@xcite the answer is affirmative .",
    "although the answer is different in these two methods , in both cases we get a piece of nontrivial information . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the newman algorithm just reproduces the initial bias : the agents which should cooperate more willingly with each other do belong to the same cluster .",
    "this structure does not reflect the fact that many agents do not cooperate at all .",
    "for @xmath20=0 , the structure obtained with the newman method is different : there are two clusters , one of them more cooperative than the other .",
    "however , this division is not strict ; in our model a half of agents do cooperate .",
    "basically , a most straightforward result for @xmath42 would be that there is no division at all .    the second method based on differential equations",
    "gives exactly this result - one cluster - for @xmath42 .",
    "however , the same result is obtained also for @xmath20 = 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "it is only for @xmath20 = 0.3 when the algorithm detects two groups of agents cooperating within their groups , leaving the uncooperative agents aside .",
    "this result is the most expected one , as it gives an information both on the group structure and on the cooperative attitude of members of these groups .",
    "the drawback of this method is that it gives the proper results only for large values of the bias @xmath20 . as the parameter @xmath20 measures the bias , the cluster structure obtained for @xmath47",
    "can be expected also for all larger @xmath20 .    summarizing , in our recent model",
    "@xcite the coupling of altruism and reputation was described as a possible mechanism of successful cooperation .",
    "here we have shown that the same model can be generalized by adding the own - group preference to individual values of the parameter of altruism . with this modification ,",
    "the model is able to reproduce the process of group formation .",
    "the groups formed in this way can be detected by current methods of search of cluster structure .",
    "in particular , the method based on differential equations @xcite allowed to separate out two groups of agents cooperating within their groups . according to this method , uncooperative agents remain outside clusters .",
