    "there are two possible reasons .",
    "one is due to the weakening of the correlation between cu spins , namely the stripe correlations on account of the increase of holes .",
    "as well known , a hole incorporated at an oxygen site in the cuo@xmath17 plane forms a zhang - rice singlet together with a cu spin , producing a spin defect .",
    "therefore , the increase of holes may weaken the cu - spin correlation in the overdoped regime , leading to the decrease of the muon - spin depolarization rate with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the other reason is due to the decrease of the superconducting volume fraction with increasing @xmath8 in the overdoped regime .",
    "first , it has been suggested from transverse - field @xmath11sr measurements in the overdoped regime of tl@xmath17ba@xmath17cuo@xmath70 , because the superconducting carrier density divided by the effective mass , @xmath71 , has been found to decrease with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite recently , the decrease of the superconducting volume fraction with increasing @xmath8 has been confirmed by tanabe _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and adachi _",
    "et al_.  @xcite from magnetic - susceptibility measurements in the overdoped regime of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , it is plausible that a phase separation into superconducting and normal - state regions takes place in the high-@xmath10 copper oxides .",
    "as the cu - spin correlation is regarded as being very weak in the normal state region , the zn - induced slowing - down of the cu - spin fluctuations may occur only in the superconducting region .",
    "therefore , the muon - spin depolarization rate may decrease with the progressive decrease of the superconducting volume fraction with increasing @xmath8 in the overdoped regime .",
    "it is a forthcoming issue to determine which reason is plausible .",
    "we have investigated the cu - spin dynamics from zf-@xmath11sr measurements in the overdoped regime of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cu@xmath2zn@xmath3o@xmath4 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the 3 % zn - substituted samples with @xmath23 and @xmath44 , exponential - like depolarization of muon spins",
    "has been observed at 0.3 k , indicating zn - induced slowing - down of the cu - spin fluctuations .",
    "almost no fast depolarization of muon spins has been observed for @xmath6 where the superconductivity disappears .",
    "the present results suggest that the dynamical stripe correlations of spins and holes exist in a wide range of @xmath8 where superconductivity appears and that the stripe - pinning model holds good in the overdoped regime as well as in the underdoped regime .",
    "this means that it is possible that the dynamical stripe correlations play an important role in the appearance of superconductivity in the high-@xmath10 copper oxides .",
