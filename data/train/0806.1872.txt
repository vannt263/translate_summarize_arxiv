    "mathematical models have been applied to the study of infectious diseases since more than a century ago .",
    "the last four decades have witnessed a burst of interest in quantitatively understanding the transmission dynamics of a large number of diseases @xcite .",
    "one of the key aims of epidemiological mathematical models , and certainly the most relevant in terms of policy making , is the assessment of the effectiveness of control strategies to curb disease spreading . for many infectious diseases ,",
    "the most widespread prevention measure is mass vaccination .",
    "however , if for a given disease vaccines are not known , or vaccination is not effective , other control measures have to be adopted .",
    "these mostly consist in some form of isolation of the infective individuals .",
    "isolation from an individual s social environment , however , can have serious psychological effects such as depression and stress @xcite .",
    "an even more drastic measure is quarantine , where individuals _ assumed _ to have been in contact with infective people are temporarily isolated from the rest of society .",
    "daniel defoe gives a forceful description of this practice and its tragic effects during the great plague of london ( 1665 - 1666 ) in his _ journal of the year of the plague_. a different strategy , that has helped preventing the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases , is contact tracing , where all the partners of an infective individual are located to be informed about the possibility of infection and , eventually , given adequate treatment .",
    "it has been argued , however , that this practice violates the right to privacy . in the case of hiv , for instance",
    ", it has sometimes met with considerable opposition @xcite .",
    "it must also be mentioned that all these measures require widespread governmental action and , frequently , allocation of substantial resources @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that a different kind of strategy , implemented by the individuals themselves , could give surprisingly positive results in controlling disease spreading @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that contact between non - infective and infective acquaintances must be systematically avoided .",
    "this can be implemented by either non - infective or infective individuals , or by both .",
    "the effects of this simple strategy have been explored by means of network epidemiological models . in these models ,",
    "each member of a population hereafter , an _",
    "agent_ occupies a node of a network @xcite .",
    "neighboring agents , which are connected by network links , can interact , and their epidemiological states ( susceptible , infective , recovered , etc . ) thus change .",
    "for instance , the interaction of a susceptible agent and an infective agent may lead , with a certain probability , to the infection of the former .",
    "the set of neighbors of a given agent represents the individual s acquaintances .    in the framework of network models ,",
    "the mechanism of avoiding contact with infective acquaintances amounts to breaking the links between susceptible and infective agents .",
    "if the social connectivity is nevertheless to be preserved , those broken links must be replaced by new connections . in the sis ( susceptible @xmath0 infective @xmath0 susceptible ) epidemiological model analyzed by @xcite ,",
    "it is susceptible agents who break contacts with their infective neighbors , what necessarily leads to the isolation of infective agents , and new connections are established only with other susceptible agents .",
    "implicitly , this assumes that the epidemiological state of all agents is known to any other agent , irrespectively of whether they are connected or not .",
    "more realistically , @xcite consider links that are broken and reconnected to randomly chosen members of the population .",
    "as described in the next section , we adopt here the same viewpoint .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid straightforward isolation of infective agents , in section [ infectives ] we generalize the model in order to also allow infective individuals to switch connections from their susceptible neighbors to new contacts chosen at random .",
    "we show that , even under these less stringent assumptions on the mechanism of link switching , the outcome is still an effective reduction in the probability of infection , which can eventually lead to the complete suppression of the disease . in section [ asymptomatics ] , we study the case where the disease has an asymptomatic period , during which infective individuals are not perceived as such but appear as being susceptible , even to themselves @xcite .",
    "in this situation , it may happen that an asymptomatic agent switches contact from an infective neighbor to a susceptible agent , thereby increasing the probability of transmission .",
    "we find that , if the asymptomatic period is not very long , large enough switching rates can still suppress the infection .",
    "results are summarized and discussed in the last section .",
    "we consider a population formed by @xmath1 agents , situated at the nodes of a network . at a given time , each of them can be either susceptible ( @xmath2 ) or infective ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "initially , each agent has exactly @xmath4 neighbors and , thus , the network has @xmath5 links .",
    "the initial contacts are chosen at random , so that the resulting network is a random regular graph .",
    "the corresponding degree distribution , i.e. the distribution of the number of neighbors per agent , is thus a delta - like function centered at @xmath4 neighbors .",
    "the infection is transmitted from infective agents to their susceptible neighbors , who become immediately infective ( @xmath6 ) , at rate @xmath7 . moreover ,",
    "infective agents get cured at rate @xmath8 . upon cure , they return to the susceptible state ( @xmath9 ) and , subsequently , can be infected again .",
    "the diseases described by the sis model are those that do not confer immunity against subsequent infections , and which have very short latent periods .",
    "models of this class have proven particularly useful for the study of chlamydia and gonorrhea @xcite .",
    "contact switching , in turn , is modeled as follows .",
    "all links joining susceptible agents ( or , for short , _ susceptibles _ ) with infective agents ( or _ infectives _ ) are broken at rate @xmath10 , and the corresponding susceptible agent is then connected to a randomly chosen agent in the population .",
    "self - connections and multiple connections between pairs of agents are avoided .",
    "taking into account the above dynamical rules , and using the pair approximation discussed in the appendix , it is possible to write down evolution equations for the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "they represent , respectively , the fraction of agents in state @xmath14 and the fraction of links joining agents in states @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the equations read @xmath16 as the total number of agents and links is preserved , this system is completed by the relations @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the constant @xmath19 derives from the pair approximation .",
    "the high - connectivity limit , @xmath20 has been considered by @xcite .    in the remaining of this article we concentrate on the equilibrium properties of our system , obtained by equating the right - hand side of eqs .",

    "( [ ecs1 ] ) , so that the time unit is the recovery time @xmath25 .",
    "the infection - free state , @xmath26 , is a trivial solution of eq .",
    "( [ basic_pol ] ) for all values of the parameters .",
    "as expected , in fact , the infection can not spontaneously appear in the absence of infectives .",
    "a second solution of the equation is always larger than unity .",
    "it therefore has no biological meaning , and will not be further discussed . as for the remaining solutions , it can be shown that for every value of the reconnection parameter @xmath27 , there is a critical value of infectiveness @xmath28 at which a transition from the infection - free ( @xmath29 ) to the endemic state ( @xmath30 ) , with persisting infection , occurs .    to determine the nature of this transition we perform a stability analysis of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ basic_pol ] ) .",
    "when the reconnection parameter is below the threshold @xmath31/(2k-1)}$ ] , the situation is similar to the case without reconnection ( @xmath32 ) . for small @xmath33",
    "the only stable non - negative solution is @xmath26 . at @xmath28 ,",
    "a transcritical bifurcation takes place .",
    "namely , another real solution becomes simultaneously positive and stable , whereas @xmath26 becomes unstable . for larger values of the infectiveness",
    ", the equilibrium fraction of infectives grows continuously from zero .",
    "when , on the other hand , @xmath34 , the only real solution for @xmath35 is @xmath26 .",
    "now , the transition at the critical infectiveness @xmath36 is a tangent bifurcation , and two real and positive solutions appear simultaneously . for @xmath37 , the larger of these two solutions is stable and the other one is unstable , while the stability of @xmath26 does not change .",
    "we have therefore a discontinuous transition from the infection - free state to the endemic state . further increasing @xmath33 ,",
    "a transcritical bifurcation point is reached , where the unstable solution vanishes and exchanges stability with @xmath26 . from then on",
    ", there is a single non - negative stable solution .",
    "between the two bifurcations , the system has two stable equilibrium states , one endemic and the other infection - free . in this bistable region ,",
    "the long - time asymptotic state is selected by the initial state of the population .",
    "an initial fraction of infectives larger than the unstable solution leads to the endemic state , whereas a smaller fraction leads to the extinction of the infection .",
    "the unstable solution thus plays the role of a threshold for the epidemics to spread and , consequently , is sometimes called _ breakpoint density _ @xcite .    in figure [ figure1 ] analytical predictions of the equilibrium fraction of infectives , calculated from eq .",
    "( [ basic_pol ] ) , are compared with numerical simulations of the epidemic process . as explained below",
    ", it makes sense to consider the solutions of eq .",

    ", the analytical curve corresponding to @xmath19 accurately fits the numerical results @xcite .",
    "when @xmath40 , on the other hand , for all but the smallest values of the reconnection parameter the curves that best fit the data are those with @xmath20 .",
    "a likely reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that , depending on @xmath27 , contact switching events generate networks with different degree distributions . it has previously been shown that , not unexpectedly , rewiring can lead to degree distributions that get broader as the reconnection parameter is increased @xcite .",
    "we have verified that the same happens in our model .",
    "it has also been pointed out that the pair approximation is not good for describing contact processes on networks with long - tailed degree distributions @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath19 , in fact , results for the pair approximation applied to regular networks with @xmath4 neighbors per node .",
    "a possible reason for the better fit with @xmath20 could be that , with the progressive broadening of the degree distribution as rewiring proceeds , agents with many connections ( @xmath41 ) appear and become dominant in the epidemiological process .",
    "these agents , usually called _ superspreaders _ , are known to be the main vector of propagation of many diseases @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath20 which , as mentioned above , corresponds to the limit of @xmath41 for a regular network is therefore a kind of effective approximation accounting for the role of such agents . in the variants of the model considered below , again ,",
    "better agreement between analytical and numerical results is found for @xmath20 .",

    ", the plane is divided into three regions . in the leftmost region , corresponding to small infectivity , the fraction of infectives asymptotically vanishes and the population reaches the infection - free state .",
    "the central v - shaped region is the bistability zone , where the endemic state is stable but the infection - free state is still reached from initial conditions with sufficiently low levels of infectives . note that , as discussed above , bistability does not occur for small reconnection parameters ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "finally , for large infectivities , we have the region where the endemic state is the only stable equilibrium of the epidemiological process . to the left , this region",

    "it is interesting to notice that results similar to those derived from eq .",
    "( [ basic_pol ] ) can be obtained from the usual approach in mathematical epidemiology , where it is assumed that an epidemic outburst occurs as soon as an infective agent can generate more than one secondary infection ( i.e. , an infection event between two agents which involves a third , intermediary agent ) .",
    "this is quantified with the basic reproductive number @xmath49 , which is the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infective agent in an otherwise healthy population @xcite .",
    "the epidemic threshold is calculated by setting @xmath50 . in our case , a straightforward calculation of the basic reproductive number yields @xmath51 from which the epidemic threshold turns out to be @xmath52 .",
    "this is exactly the value at which the transcritical bifurcation occurs in our model when @xmath19 .",
    "the slightly smaller result we obtain for @xmath20 , @xmath48 , is a consequence of the above discussed correction : it is well - known that wider degree distributions lead to smaller epidemic thresholds @xcite .    with the aim of making this basic model more realistic ,",
    "two variants are considered in the following . in the first one ,",
    "infective agents are allowed to reconnect their contacts with susceptibles . in the second , an asymptomatic stage in the disease",
    "is taken into account .",
    "our basic model can be generalized to the more realistic situation where not only susceptibles are allowed to change their contacts , but also infectives can break their links with susceptible neighbours and redirect them to other members of the population .",
    "this possibility would stand for an altruistic attitude of infectives , in an attempt to inhibit the infection spread . to implement this variation",

    "we verify that simulations display the same qualitative behavior as the model , even though the analytical prediction is not as good as for @xmath55 ( cf . fig .",

    "in fact , reconnection never increases the number of susceptible - infective links . in the next section ,",
    "on the other hand , we consider a variation of the basic model where susceptible - infective links can be created by contact switching .",
    "several common diseases possess an asymptomatic stage , intermediary between the susceptible and the infective phases , during which individuals carrying the infection do not exhibit symptoms , and are therefore seen as non - infective by themselves and by the rest of the population . in the asymptomatic stage , however , an infective person may already transmit the disease by contagion .",
    "it is well known that during the several plagues that ravaged europe , infective people who did not yet have visible symptoms became one of the main vectors for the propagation of the disease , when they fled the cities .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to fear that , for a disease with an asymptomatic phase , the strategy of contact switching might reinforce the spread of the disease , instead of curbing it .    to address these issues ,",
    "in this section we analyze a model with three types of agents , namely , @xmath2 , @xmath14 ( asymptomatic ) , and @xmath3 .",
    "it is basically an extension of the model studied in section [ basic ] , because the interactions between susceptibles and infectives are the same .",
    "we assume that asymptomatic agents do not know that they are infective , and therefore act as susceptible individuals : they reconnect their links with infective neighbors at the same rate @xmath10 as susceptibles . on the other hand",
    ", asymptomatic agents can infect their susceptible neighbors at the same rate @xmath7 as infectives .",
    "note that a main difference with the two models analyzed above is that , now , susceptible - asymptomatic links which allow for the transmission of the infection can be created by reconnection from asymptomatic - infective links , which join two agents carrying the infection .    to characterize the transitions @xmath70 and",
    "@xmath71 we introduce a new parameter @xmath72 .",
    "the rate at which asymptomatic agents become ( symptomatic ) infectives is @xmath73 , while the rate at which infectives become susceptible is @xmath74 . with these definitions , the asymptomatic and infective phases last , on the average , @xmath75 and @xmath76 time units , respectively .",

    "even though this constraint might seem reasonable , the voluntary nature of contact switching suggests relaxing it .",
    "we have analyzed a model where both types of agents can switch contacts , with a new parameter @xmath53 giving the probability that it is the infective agent who breaks and reconnects the link with a susceptible neighbor .",
    "remarkably , we find that , for certain values of the parameters that characterize the disease , reconnection can completely suppress the infection for intermediate values of @xmath53 , but not for larger or smaller values .",
    "furthermore , even when the disease is not completely suppressed , equilibrium infection levels can be lower when more infectives are allowed to reconnect . even though , at first sight , this might seem counterintuitive , it can be readily understood , at least for high infection levels : if the fraction of infectives is large , susceptibles are likely to reconnect their broken links to other infectives , thus not altering their risk of getting infected . on the other hand ,",
    "when an infective agent reconnects , which with high probability occurs to other infectives , the number of `` dangerous '' links decreases .",
    "it has been shown that the outcome of many strategies to control epidemic outbreaks depends not only on the reproductive number of the disease , but also on the number of infections caused by an agent before the onset of clinical symptoms @xcite . in the case of contact switching , it is even possible that the presence of an asymptomatic phase leads to an acceleration of the spread of the disease . in section [ asymptomatics ]",
    "we analyzed an extension of the basic model , introducing a parameter @xmath72 which gives , on average , the fraction of time that the agent spends in an asymptomatic phase during the infection . in this phase",
    ", the agent behaves as a susceptible individual , but can transmit the infection through contagion .",
    "we find that , in this case , reconnection does lead to higher levels of infection , but this effect is restricted to some limited regions of parameter space .",
    "furthermore , within these regions , the increase of this infection level due to reconnection is rather small , unless its value is already very high in the absence of reconnection .",
    "it should be clear that any significant assessment of the benefits and risks of contact switching must use sound estimates of all the variables involved , applying them to realistic models of the analyzed population .",
    "important features that may be added to the above models are , for instance , the population division into females and males who often exhibit rather different epidemiological responses and age groups , as well as more complex degree distributions in the initial network . such generalizations , however , will hardly be amenable to analytical treatment . in our basic model and its extensions ,",
    "on the other hand , most epidemiological features can be studied analytically .",
    "it is only after these have been fully understood that more complex models should be tackled .",
    "models of epidemic spreading can be studied as stochastic contact processes on networks @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the procedure with the basic sis model presented in section [ basic ] .",
    "for each site @xmath120 of the network we introduce the probability @xmath121 that the agent at @xmath120 is in state @xmath14 ( either @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) at time @xmath122 . the evolution equation for this probability",
    "is : @xmath123 where @xmath8 is the rate at which an infective agent becomes susceptible , and @xmath7 is the rate at which infective agents infect each of their susceptible neighbors . here , @xmath124 denotes the probability that the agents in sites @xmath120 and @xmath125 are susceptible and infective , respectively , and that they are connected .",
    "generally , we also introduce @xmath126 as the probability that an agent in state @xmath14 at site @xmath120 and an agent in state @xmath15 at site @xmath125 are connected , and @xmath127 as the probability that the same agents are _ not _ connected .",
    "the evolution equations for these two - sites probabilities are @xmath128 where @xmath10 is the rate at which a susceptible - infective link is broken , and the susceptible agent reconnected to a random agent .",
    "the remaining two - site probability @xmath129 is obtained from the fact that the sum of all two - sites probabilities equals unity .",
    "the interpretation of the different summands in each equation is rather straightforward . in the first equation , for instance ,",
    "the first two terms account for the probability that a connected susceptible - infective pair is created from an infective - infective pair , or destroyed , by the spontaneous cure of an infective agent .",
    "the third and fourth terms account for the probability that infection is acquired from , or transmitted to , a neighbor outside the considered pair .",
    "the fifth term accounts for the probability that infection is transmitted from the infective agent to the susceptible agent in the same pair .",
    "the last two terms account for the probability that the pair is created or destroyed by the reconnection process . in these terms , the denominators take into account the fact that , when the susceptible agent reconnects a link , the new contact must exclude the previous neighbors of the agent in question .    within the _ pair approximation _",
    "@xcite , the three - site probabilities in eqs .",
    "( [ eq.system ] ) can be approximately given in terms of two - site probabilities , thus closing the equation system .",
    "the basic idea of this approximation is that , in a chain of three of connected sites , @xmath130 , the mutual interactions between the central site @xmath125 of and each of the other two neighbors , @xmath120 and @xmath131 , can be decoupled : @xmath132 the constant @xmath38 is determined either from analytical considerations , which give @xmath19 , or from heuristic arguments for example , a better fit of simulations , as done here in the main text .",
    "we assume that all the probabilities are homogeneous over the population , i. e. that they do not depend on the site , which is true if the initial probabilities are also homogeneous .",
    "we also assume that the epidemiological states at sites that are not connected can be taken as independent , i. e. @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( using also the pair approximation ) .",
    "a further approximation that simplifies the equations considerably is to assume that the number of neighbors of each site is much smaller than the total number of agents so that , when an agents reconnects , the probability that another specific agent becomes the new contact is simply @xmath135 , thus simplifying the denominator of the reconnection terms .    to write the equations in terms of the fractions of agents , @xmath136 and @xmath21 , and links , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 we take into account the relations @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "using these equivalences , and the approximations mentioned above , eqs .",
