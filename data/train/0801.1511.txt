    "microlensing can be a powerful tool to study binaries and planets @xcite . until recently it has been assumed that most lenses , whether single or multiple stars , are likely to be at least several kpc away , either in the galactic halo or in the distant system of monitored sources .",
    "it therefore seemed likely that follow - up observations would be of limited value for multiple systems discovered through their action as lenses . in this paper",
    "we turn things around and consider lensing by binaries and planetary systems that are relatively nearby , within @xmath4 kpc .",
    "we refer to these nearby lenses as _ mesolenses _ because ( 1 ) a combination of spatial and time lensing signatures may be exhibited by the events , ( 2 ) they have a high probability , relative to more distant lenses , of producing detectable lensing events , and ( 3 ) targeted observations designed to study the lensing action of some selected individual masses are possible .",
    "( see distefano 2005 . )",
    "the lensing science is well - understood .",
    "we therefore concentrate on contrasts between nearby and more distant multiple lenses , framing the issues in terms of possible observing programs .",
    "section 2 focuses on photometric monitoring , including ongoing and planned programs such as pan - starrs @xcite and lsst @xcite .",
    " 3 discusses ground - based astrometric monitoring , which will be carried out by both pan - starrs and lsst . in ",
    "4 we consider the possibility of selecting individual stars to be targets of sensitive lensing studies . in  5 we discuss what lensing can reveal about companion stars and planets , listing our expectations for the next decade in  5.1 , and , in  5.2 , emphasizing the contrasts and interplay with other types of investigations , such as doppler and transit studies .",
    "monitoring of large , dense background fields has led to the discovery of thousands of lensing events .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . microlensing monitoring programs have already begun to discover nearby ( @xmath0 kpc ) lenses @xcite .",
    "it is only a matter of time before a nearby planet or binary is discovered through its action as a lens .",
    "this is very likely to happen in data already collected , or being collected .",
    "the ogle team , e.g. , is presently discovering more than @xmath5 lensing events per year @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of these are caused by lenses located within @xmath4 kpc ; most of these lenses are in binaries and/or have planets .",
    "light curves associated with binary and planet lenses have been discovered @xcite .",
    "none of the known multiple lenses appear to be nearby .",
    "the discovery rate will increase dramatically during the coming decade as a new generation of monitoring programs begins , including pan - starrs and lsst .",
    "tens of thousands of events caused by nearby lenses alone will be discovered over a decade ( distefano 2007 ) .",
    "good photometry and astrometry will allow a significant fraction of all binary and planet lens events to be identified .",
    "* the einstein ring : * the image of a source at a distance of @xmath6 , located directly behind a lens of mass @xmath7 at a distance @xmath8 , is a ring with angular radius equal to the einstein angle , @xmath9 @xmath10:= .01 sqrt[1/1.4 100/50 ] % out[3]= 0.0119523\\ ] ] the einstein radius is @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 pc , @xmath14 au .",
    "this is smaller than the values typical for microlensing . let @xmath15 be the ratio between the projected orbital separation , @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "binary effects are easiest to detect when @xmath19 .",
    "* rotating binary lenses : * in standard microlensing , typical values of @xmath20 are several au .",
    "binarity is detected for systems with orbital periods on the order of years , generally significantly longer than the event durations .",
    "model fits either do not require orbital motion , or require only small phase changes during the event @xcite .",
    "the time scale for photometric events is set by the value of @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transverse velocity .",
    "if the orbital period is @xmath23 @xmath24^{{1}\\over{4}}\\ ] ] for nearby binary lenses , this ratio can be larger than unity .",
    "figure 1 shows light curves for nearby low - mass binaries completing at least one complete orbital cycle during a lensing event .",
    "these light curves , which happen to have been generated for face - on circular orbits , can not be fit by static models .",
    "at least one additional physical model parameter , the orbital period , is needed .",
    "deriving the value of @xmath25 provides a relation between the total lens mass and the value of the semimajor axis .",
    "* intriguing binaries with dim components , and rotation signatures : * the multiples most likely to be discovered by monitoring programs are those with minimal blending of light from the lens : binaries consisting of low - mass dwarfs or dim stellar remnants are favored",
    ". we therefore considered binaries and planetary systems with primaries that were black holes ( bhs ) , neutron stars ( nss ) , and low - mass dwarfs .",
    "we generated a large number of binaries and planetary systems ; the models are described in the caption to figure 2 .",
    "we selected those for which evidence of binarity is potentially detectable ( @xmath15 in the range @xmath26 ) , and for which significant rotation would be expected during a lensing event ( we required rotation through @xmath27 while the source was within @xmath28 of the lens ) .",
    "the average separations are shown in figure 2 . for bh binaries ,",
    "the average orbital separation lies between a few tenths of an au through a few au .",
    "this range includes the natural end states of those mass transfer binaries with a high - mass ( low - mass ) donor which eventually becomes a neutron star ( white dwarf ) .",
    "binaries of this type should exist and can be discovered through lensing , as can binaries in which a bh is orbited by a dwarf star or planet .",
    "similar statements apply to nss , in that the range of orbital separations shown in figure 2 encompasses interesting classes of double - degenerate and ns / low - mass - companion systems . if the primary is a low - mass dwarf ( bottom two sets of lines ) , then both components have low mass .",
    "this regime is also unexplored .",
    "interestingly enough , some of the close m - dwarf / planet separations satisfying our conditions , would place the planet in the habitable zone ( di  stefano & night 2007 ) .",
    "lensing produces centroid shifts , which have been well - studied for point lenses ( dominik & sahu 2000 ; bozza 2001 ; an & han 2002 ) .",
    "let @xmath29 be the angle of closest approach between the lens and source , expressed in units of @xmath9 for @xmath30 the angular shifts in the position of bright images tend to be in the range of tenths of @xmath31 the effect decreases as @xmath32 this has the implication that monitoring programs sensitive to centroid shifts larger than a few milliarcseconds will be able to detect the astrometric effects caused by nearby lenses for values of @xmath29 that can be larger than unity .",
    "monitoring conducted by programs like pan - starrs and lsst will have the required sensitivity .",
    "these shifts are comparable to those expected in many mesolensing events . ]    for point lenses , the centroid of light traces an ellipse which starts and ends at the true source position . for this paper ,",
    "the most relevant question is whether the shifts produced by binary lenses are sufficiently different , to allow us to determine that the lens is a binary .",
    "figure 3 demonstrates that binary lenses can produce deviations from this pattern with sizes in the range @xmath33 therefore , depending on the value of @xmath34 the binary parameters , and the path of the source behind the lens , the spatial deviations associated with binaries can be detected and measured .",
    "the motion of the centroid encodes information about the mass of the lens and its binary characteristics ( mass ratio and projected orbital separation ) that can be used to determine the properties of the lens .",
    "let @xmath35 represent the average rate at which a single lens generates detectable events . because @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath36 its value for nearby lenses can be high .",
    "a solar - mass star with transverse velocity @xmath37 km s@xmath38 , and @xmath13 pc , produces events at an average rate of @xmath39 per year , provided that the average stellar density of the background is greater than roughly a few per sq .",
    "details are presented in di stefano ( 2005 ) .",
    "we can take the rate for an individual point lens to be a lower bound , since lens multiplicity increases the rate by a factor that approaches @xmath40 as the value of @xmath41 becomes larger than roughly @xmath42    given 100 nearby lenses in front of dense source fields , we therefore expect , on average , several detectable events per year .",
    "( note that , per sq .",
    "degree , there are @xmath43 dwarf stars located within @xmath44 pc . ) by examining the backgrounds behind potential lenses , we can identify those in front of particularly promising regions ( e.g. , those in which the lens proper motion is directed toward a star or an upward fluctuation in the surface brightness ) .",
    "in addition , detectability can be enhanced by more sensitive observations .",
    "the rate quoted above assumed ten percent photometry . if , instead , our observations can reliably detect a @xmath45 deviation from baseline , the rate will be @xmath46 times higher .",
    "( @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fractional increase in the baseline light needed for a detection . )",
    "it is also important that @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the smallest region over which we can reliably detect a deviation from baseline ; this is because the lensing of a single star is more easily detected if the total number of stars per resolution element is small . for a large variety of dense backgrounds , and",
    "under optimal observing conditions , an individual lens can produce events at a sequence of times that can be predicted ( di stefano 2005 ) . in some cases",
    ", event detection will require masking light from the primary star .",
    "for a discussion of the history of proposed targeted studies see distefano 2005 ,  3.2.4 .",
    "figures 1 , 3 , and 4 illustrate what can be learned about binaries and planets by studying events , or even sequence of events .",
    "\\(1 ) monitoring programs will discover and correctly identify planetary systems and binaries located within a kiloparsec , many exhibiting significant orbital motion .",
    "the components of these nearby multiples will include stellar remnants , low - mass stars , brown dwarfs , and planets .",
    "if @xmath51 of the lenses are nearby , and @xmath51 ( @xmath45 ) of binary ( planet ) lenses can be identified , then ten years of ogle will identify dozens of nearby binaries and a handful of planets . if future observing programs can detect deviations from baseline of @xmath52 , against dense stellar regions @xmath53 on a side , the discovery rate of events per field will increase by a factor of @xmath54 in addition , considering dense backgrounds and the backgrounds provided by individual stars , all - sky monitoring will effectively cover more than @xmath55 times the area now regularly monitored by ogle .",
    "\\(2 ) nearby multiple systems discovered via lensing will be targeted for multiwavelength studies .",
    "if the components are stellar remnants , follow - up observations at x - ray wavelengths may establish their nature .",
    "of particular interest are stellar remnants in binaries that have completed their mass transfer histories , but which are not yet copious emitters of gravity waves .",
    "if the components are cool dwarfs , spectroscopic studies may measure orbital parameters .",
    "\\(3 ) nearby masses in front of distant dense source fields will be targeted for lensing studies . within @xmath44 pc",
    "there are @xmath43 dwarf stars ( m or later ) per sq . degree .",
    "if @xmath44 sq . degree of the sky provides a useful background , then lensing by up to @xmath56 very nearby dwarf stars , many of which are likely to be multiples , are potential targets .",
    "we must develop ways to systematically identify those with backgrounds most likely to produce detectable effects , and to predict the times at which observations are most likely to be fruitful .",
    "even _ luminous _ stars will be targeted for lensing studies , by conducting observations in wavebands in which the potential lens is dark , or employ masking techniques .",
    "work is needed to determine the best ways to block light from the primary in a lens to optimize the study of light from the images of background sources .",
    "\\(4 ) lensing observations will determine system parameters for many binaries .",
    "under ideal circumstances , the total mass of the lens system can be determined , as can the orbital period , separation , and mass ratio .",
    "lensing studies can sometimes even provide two ways to determine the same quantity , allowing consistency checks .",
    "doppler shifts and eclipses ( or transits ) have provided most of the information we have about multiple systems .",
    "doppler techniques require that enough photons be received from the system to provide a well - delineated spectrum ; transits require enough photons to allow us to distinguish small changes in the amount of light received .",
    "lensing , on the other hand , can detect the multiplicity of objects that provide little or no flux .",
    "it can thereby extend the reach of our studies to dark and dim objects , such as nearby binaries consisting of neutron stars and dim low - mass dwarfs with planets .    to apply doppler techniques ,",
    "the velocity of the central star must have a significant radial component .",
    "transits can only be observed if the orbital inclination lies in a relatively narrow , nearly edge - on range .",
    "lensing , in contrast , requires only that the components of the multiple are separated by @xmath57 .",
    "lensing can therefore detect binarity and discover planets in systems not accessible to other methods .    lensing studies do , however , face some unique challenges . first , we know that the binary identification of the early monitoring projects is incomplete @xcite .",
    "this , however , is not due to intrinsic barriers , and is not unique to nearby binaries and planets . in this paper",
    "we therefore assume that efforts to improve the selection criteria used by new programs will be successful .",
    "the new challenges special to the study of nearby multiples are : ( 1 ) establishing the nature of the primary in those cases in which the binary does not emit much radiation . ( 2 ) developing useful criteria to decide which known foreground objects , including luminous stars , are good targets for lensing studies .",
    "* summary : * until now , lensing has generally been viewed as a way to explore binary and planet populations of distant populations ( see .",
    "e.g. , di stefano 2001 ) .",
    "we find that lensing can also be used to discover nearby multiple systems with dark or dim components . whether the primary is dim or bright , lensing can",
    ", in principle , measure orbital parameters .",
    "further work focused on these possibilities will allow lensing to join doppler studies and transit studies as an important and productive way to study the population and properties of nearby binaries and planets .",
