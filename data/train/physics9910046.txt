    "recent intensive studies @xcite of the antiproton ( @xmath0 ) delayed annihilation in helium allowed the discovery of unique features of antiprotonic he systems . theoretical explanation of abnormal lifetime ( @xmath1s ) of certain antiproton fraction in he requires the existence of antiprotonic he systems which have radiative and auger de - excitation lifetime of the order of @xmath2 s and are very stable with respect to the thermal collisions with surrounding he atoms .",
    "it was first suggested by condo @xcite and validated by further detailed studies @xcite that highly excited circular ( or near circular ) states of antiprotonic he atoms ( he@xmath3)@xmath4 ( here n is principal quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number of the antiprotonic state ) should have extremely small ( in atomic scale ) auger de - excitation rates ( @xmath5 s@xmath6for @xmath7 ) .",
    "the lifetime of such highly excited antiprotonic atoms , if they are isolated from collisions with surrounding medium , is determined by the radiative transitions and is of the order of @xmath2 s. this fact motivates for treating antiprotonic he atom as a system responsible for delayed annihilation .",
    "meanwhile , the complete understanding of the problem can be obtained only carefully analyzing the effects of the collisions of such a system with surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that different states of metastable antiprotonic atoms could be affected by several collisional quenching mechanisms , which are stark transitions to nonstable states , collisionally induced auger decay and rearrangement processes , like short living molecular ion formation .",
    "in this paper we analyze those rearrangement collisions which result in the antiproton transfer from high metastable states of the antiprotonic he ( with principal quantum number @xmath8 ) to noble gas contaminant atoms .",
    "some remarkable features enable to distinguish this process among others .",
    "first , one can expect that such transfer of antiproton to nonhelium atom will result in the fast auger de - excitation @xcite and following annihilation of antiproton on the contaminant nucleus , which can be checked experimentally .",
    "second , it is reasonable to expect classical character of antiprotonic transfer , thus the corresponding reaction cross - sections should be of the order of geometrical atomic cross - sections at least for certain states of antiprotonic he .",
    "we will show that taking into account antiproton transfer mechanism , it is possible to obtain qualitative explanation of existing experimental data on contaminant quenching , in particular about the apparent discrepancy between experimental results on noble gas contaminant quenching obtained by different experimental groups .",
    "existing experimental results on quenching of antiprotonic atom metastable states by noble gas contaminants were obtained by obelix collaboration ( ps 201 ) @xcite and cern group ( ps205 ) @xcite .",
    "the averaged over different metastable states quenching cross - sections obtained by the two groups are shown in table 1 , with their corresponding ratios .",
    "@xmath9    a dramatic difference between the results of the two groups can be seen , specially for ne and ar .",
    "we must notice that the mentioned experiments have been done under different conditions , among which we outline the different contaminant concentration .",
    "in obelix experiment the same quenching rate was observed with concentrations of noble gas contaminant several orders of magnitude less than in ps205 experiment .",
    "unfortunately , there are no data obtained in the overlapping ranges of contaminant densities .",
    "such a discrepancy suggests the idea that quenching effects are very different for different metastable antiprotonic states in the sense that the lifetime of certain metastable states is measurable for small contaminant concentrations only , while for big enough concentrations it becomes too short to be distinguished from the prompt peak .",
    "thus the averaged over antiprotonic states quenching cross - section becomes a function of contaminant density .",
    "we will show that estimation of the antiproton transfer rates supports for such an explanation of the difference in extracted quenching cross - section values .",
    "the correct description of inelastic collisions of an antiprotonic atom with medium atoms requires taking into account simultaneously all possible reaction channels .",
    "we will show , however , that it is meaningful to distinguish the antiproton transfer mechanism among other processes and treat it separately .",
    "let us first make some qualitative remarks",
    ". we will be interested in the reaction :    @xmath10 \\longrightarrow \\left [ he ( \\text{a}^{++}\\overline{p}% ) _ { n^{\\prime},l^{\\prime } } \\right ] + e   \\label{at}\\ ] ]    where a reads essentially for a contaminant atom present in the surrounding medium .    in this reaction the exchange of electron and antiproton between he and contaminant atom a takes place , which results in a virtual formation of the molecular system @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the energy excess is then transferred to an auger electron of the contaminant atom , while the molecular ion @xmath12 $ ] is formed in the final state .",
    "we notice that the more simple reaction :    @xmath13    occurs with significant probability only in the resonance case , i.e. when bounding energy of @xmath14 is equal to that of @xmath15 . in nonresonance case an energy excess ( which characteristic value in mentioned reactions is about 0.1 ev ) is transferred to atomic nuclei relative motion and no term crossing takes place in this case .",
    "thus reaction probability turns to be exponentially small .",
    "an obvious exception is antiprotonic helium collision with he atoms of surrounding medium :    @xmath16    as it follows from our calculations , reaction ( [ at2 ] ) takes place for antiprotonic states with principal quantum number @xmath17 .",
    "such states are already quenched within short time by stark de - excitation collisions @xcite and can not be observed within the delayed component . in the same time we will show that reaction ( [ at ] ) for ne and ar contaminants affect certain states belonging to the observed delayed fraction .",
    "the amplitude of reaction ( [ at ] ) is determined by the overlapping of the antiprotonic wave function of @xmath14 and the antiprotonic wave function of ( a@xmath18 .",
    "we will show later , that there is a repulsive barrier in the effective interaction of antiprotonic he and noble gas atom , which prevents close collisions .",
    "clearly antiproton transfer has a chance only if the interatomic separation becomes small enough during the collision , to ensure overlapping of the wave function of antiproton centered on he , and that of medium atoms .",
    "this last condition determines the reaction probability dependence on antiprotonic quantum numbers .",
    "we will show that for the interaction of antiprotonic he with ne and ar , antiproton transfer takes place for states with @xmath19      we search the wave function of the system ( @xmath20)@xmath21 a in the form :    @xmath22 f_{\\left\\ { \\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\right\\ } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\delta } \\widetilde{\\chi } _ { \\gamma } ^{\\overline{p% } } \\widehat{p}\\left [ g_{\\left\\ { \\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\delta \\right\\ } } ^{e}\\varphi _ { \\alpha } ^{e}\\widetilde{\\psi } _ { \\beta } ^{+e}\\right ] y_{\\delta } \\label{fs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the eigenfunctions of the electron in the field of he nuclei , contaminant atom electron wave function , and @xmath0  wave function in the field of he nuclei , screened by electron in the ground state respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the electron wave function of contaminant ion ( with charge + 1 ) , the @xmath0  wave function centered on contaminant nuclei , the wave function of the nuclei relative motion in bound ( molecular ) state respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is the permutation operator , which antisymmetrizes the total electronic wave function .",
    "the expansion coefficient @xmath30 has the sense of the nuclei relative motion wave function in the scattering state , while @xmath31 can be interpreted as auger electron wave function .",
    "@xmath32and @xmath33 include reaction amplitudes to be find .",
    "the mentioned form of the wave function enables to take into account physically important effects of exchange of the electrons and antiproton between nuclei , as well as the antisymmetrization of the electronic wave - function .",
    "we obtain the coupled equations system for functions @xmath34 , @xmath35 by substituting expansions ( [ fs ] ) in the shrodinger equation for the interacting systems .    for the purpose of qualitative estimations of the rate of the exchange mechanism",
    ", we have truncated the mentioned equation system to only few coupled equations .      the coupled equation system for @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 can be transformed into the one - channel shrodinger equation for the relative nucleus motion in the elastic channel @xmath38 :    @xmath39    such an equation includes a complex nonlocal interaction term @xmath40 .",
    "this interaction describes elastic scattering and absorption into inelastic channels and depends on quantum numbers @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that leading terms of the real part @xmath42 of such effective interaction have local form and can be interpreted as antiprotonic atom - media atom potential in given state .",
    "we should mention that both local and nonlocal terms in @xmath43 are important for reaction rates calculation , nevertheless the analysis of local real terms alone turns to be very useful .",
    "such a potential for ( he@xmath3)@xmath44he interaction is shown on fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "important features of this potential are the following :    1 .   there is a repulsive barrier between ( @xmath20)@xmath4 and he at internuclear distance 3 au@xmath45 au ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the height of this barrier strongly depends on n , l ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "its height is about 0.2 ev for n=38 , l=37 and is negligible for @xmath17 .",
    "such a barrier appears as a result of antisymmetrization of 3-electron wave function of interacting ( @xmath46)@xmath44he atoms and represents an effect of pauli repulsion .",
    "the minimum classically allowed interatomic separation distance , which is determined by this repulsive part of effective interaction , plays an important role for determination of quenching reaction rates . for the antiprotonic state with n=39",
    "it was found to be @xmath47 au .",
    "the repulsive barrier appears also in ( @xmath20)@xmath44ne and ( @xmath48)@xmath44ar effective interaction .",
    "as it follows from our calculations ne and ar can penetrate to short enough distances during the collision with antiprotonic he and this is a crucial point for estimation of antiprotonic transfer reactions .",
    "2 .   at the internuclear distances",
    "@xmath49 from 1 au . to 3 au . ,",
    "the ( @xmath48)@xmath44he potential is attractive .",
    "this attraction is mainly due to the @xmath0 exchange between the two nuclei .",
    "the range of the attractive part is determined by the overlapping of antiprotonic states , centered on the two nuclei ; it vanishes rapidly as soon as the internuclear distance becomes grater than two mean radii of antiprotonic state with quantum numbers n and l. this part of interaction is important for antiprotonic transfer reactions . 3 .   at large internuclear distances",
    "there is a weak polarization attraction between ( @xmath20)@xmath4 and contaminant atom a : @xmath50    this long range attractive interaction radically enhances inelastic cross - sections , specially in case of low temperatures ( t300k ) .",
    "the constant @xmath51 depends on contaminant .",
    "this last statement is important for understanding the difference in quenching effect of noble gas contaminants .    we should mention that imaginary part @xmath52 of the effective interaction is localized mainly at internuclear distances @xmath533 au .",
    "thus the repulsive barrier between ( @xmath20)@xmath4 and he for @xmath54 prevents close collisions , which may result in intensive inelastic transitions and quenching of metastable antiprotonic states .      in this subsection",
    "we present the estimation of the antiproton transfer cross - sections for different states of ( @xmath20)@xmath4 .",
    "we found strong dependence of quenching cross - sections on the principal quantum number of the antiprotonic atoms .",
    "in particular , the corresponding cross - sections of antiproton transfer for the states with @xmath55 are :    @xmath56    mentioned states become short - living ( @xmath57 s ) in the presence of noble gas contaminants with density @xmath58 @xmath59 .    in the same time",
    "the antiproton transfer probability for states with @xmath60 is negligible(see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "such a  threshold ",
    "behavior of the transfer cross - section as a function of principal quantum number is clear from the following qualitative argument .",
    "as it follows from the properties of effective interatomic interaction , the less is n of given antiprotonic state the higher is the repulsive barrier and the bigger is interatomic separation during the collision . on the other hand",
    "the less is n , the less is the overlapping of the antiprotonic functions centered on he and contaminant atom , respectively for given interatomic separation .",
    "we have found that n=40 plays a role of critical number for antiproton transfer from he to ne and ar .",
    "the existing experimental data on noble gas contaminant quenching can now be explained in terms of state dependent quenching mechanism .",
    "the antiprotonic transfer reactions affect the population of the states with @xmath61 .",
    "these states are long living in the absence of contaminants .",
    "rather small concentration of contaminant gases , like those used by obelix ( @xmath62 ) , can produce measurable effects ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the averaged over states quenching cross - section , derived from obelix data , correspond to the antiproton transfer reaction cross - sections .",
    "much higher concentration of contaminant ne or ar ( @xmath64 ) , used in ps205 experiment , produce quenching rates @xmath65 , which make impossible to distinguish such states from the prompt peak . on the other hand the states with @xmath66 are not quenched by antiproton transfer reactions .",
    "the main contaminant quenching mechanism for these states is induced auger de - excitation @xcite ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding quenching cross - sections are @xcite :    @xmath67    the concentration of noble gas contaminants required to produce measurable quenching of these states is @xmath68 , corresponding to those used in ps205 experiment .",
    "thus it may be expected that the results obtained by ps205 experiment refer to the quenching of states with @xmath66 .",
    "this fact enables to understand qualitatively the discrepancy between the results of the two experimental groups ( obelix and ps205 ) for ne and ar contaminant quenching @xcite .",
    "the difference in the contaminant densities ( @xmath69 @xmath70 for ps205 , and @xmath71 @xmath70 for obelix ) correspond to the difference between the extracted values of the average quenching cross - sections .",
    "some experiments can be suggested to clarify the situation .",
    "first it seems reasonable to obtain results for the whole range of contaminant densities to check if asymptotic behaviors of quenching rates , which are different in the two experiments , match at the intermediate densities",
    ".    the direct check of the antiproton transfer reactions could be the observation of heavy fragments produced by antiproton annihilation on contaminant nuclei among the delayed events .",
    "the laser spectroscopy methods , similar to those applied for observing @xmath72 assisted resonances @xcite , seem to be also useful to study noble gas contaminant quenching .",
    "in fact , inducing laser transition from state with n=39 to states with @xmath8 in the presence of ne or ar at densities @xmath73 , one should observe resonance in annihilation events having width proportional to the contaminant concentration .",
    "we have found that the approach , in which the state dependence of quenching rates is taken into account , enables to explain existing experimental data .",
    "the mentioned above antiproton transfer reaction rates indeed have very sharp dependence on antiprotonic helium state quantum numbers . the theoretical model suggested here , is based on the following statements .    1 .   for the states with @xmath54 and auger transition multipolarity @xmath74",
    "there is a repulsive barrier which prevents from close collisions in ",
    "antiprotonic atom - medium atoms  interaction and therefore plays a stabilizing role .",
    "the physical reason of such barrier is pauli repulsion of the saturated electronic shell of noble gases and the electron of antiprotonic he .",
    "the mentioned barrier determines the minimum separation between atoms during collision , on which quenching reaction rates critically depend . 2 .",
    "the leading contaminant quenching mechanism of metastable antiprotonic he states with @xmath55 is antiproton transfer reaction , followed by fast antiproton annihilation on the contaminant nucleus .",
    "the cross - section of this type of reactions is estimated to be : + @xmath56 + in the same time the noble gas contaminant quenching of states with @xmath66 is two orders of magnitude less .",
    "the evolution of the antiprotonic atoms passes through the stage of molecular ion formation , especially in the presence of noble gas contaminant .",
    "this fact was first pointed out by e. zavattini @xcite . in the present work we studied short living antiprotonic molecular ion formation . in the same time",
    "the problem of possible existence of long living states of antiprotonic molecular ion remains an open question .",
    "experimental test of the above presented theoretical results may include direct observation of heavy fragments among the delayed annihilation events , produced by antiproton annihilation on contaminant nuclei as well as laser induced transitions from states with @xmath66 to states with @xmath8 in the presence of ne or ar at concentrations @xmath73 .",
