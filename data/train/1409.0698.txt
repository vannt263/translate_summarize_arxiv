    "the phase diagram of matter described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in terms of quarks and gluons , i.e. , the qcd phase diagram has not been unveiled yet in spite of tremendous theoretical and experimental efforts  @xcite . the severest obstacle lies in the notorious sign problem which prevents the first - principle lattice qcd simulation from working at high baryon density , though there are steady progresses to circumvent it  @xcite .",
    "there are so many theoretical speculations on the qcd phase structures but it is next to impossible to constrain them enough to pin the right one down or to eliminate unphysical ones . even if there were a way to evade the sign problem , it would still be a highly non - trivial question whether the numerical simulation can correctly identify the genuine ground state if it includes a possibility of spatial modulation  @xcite . taking the continuum limit and overcoming",
    "the discretization error should be crucial to resolve intricate structures such as the critical point  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a heuristic argument ) and , if any , the crystalline condensates  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an argument parallel to ref .",
    "@xcite and also ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "it is thus our hope that the experimental data should be able to constrain diverse candidates of the qcd phase diagram , so that we can identify the correct answer .",
    "now that there are reasonable evidences for the formation of a new state of matter out of quarks and gluons , that is called the quark - gluon plasma , at high enough energy , some of future heavy - ion collision programs are directed toward higher baryon density with lower collision energies . such a project to explore the qcd phase diagram by tuning the collision energy is often called the beam - energy scan ( bes ) and the star collaboration at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) already published the first bes ( i.e. , bes - i ) results  @xcite .",
    "the primary mission of the bes was to discover the so - called qcd critical point by looking at fluctuations of conserved quantities such as the baryon number and the strangeness  @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no appreciable indication that signals for the critical behavior   data ( that was motivated to improve the statistics ) suggests critical behavior .",
    "it is still under dispute ; i should note that , if @xmath2 , the kinetic energy should be ; @xmath3 leading to @xmath4 .",
    "it should be explained why higher ( above @xmath5 ) @xmath6 data enhance the criticality .",
    "so , in this work , i shall focus on the published data only . ] , and nevertheless , the bes has turned out to be extremely intriguing for qcd physics , for our understanding of finite - density qcd is severely limited and any hint would be useful . with accumulation of abundant experimental data , it might be even feasible to find a way for drastic simplification leading to pragmatic modeling .",
    "we have already witnessed such simplification in rhic at high temperature @xmath7 and low baryon chemical potential @xmath8 ; the statistical thermal fit  @xcite and the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein and also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent study ) stunningly reproduce the experimental yields of particles and they are also consistent with lattice - qcd thermodynamics . nobody had believed in the reality of such an oversimplified description of non - interacting hadrons before the good agreement to experimental data was confirmed .",
    "although the theoretical foundation needs more investigations , this a bit expedient but profitable tool for data analysis is as effective for analyzing experimental data taken by the alice collaboration at large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , though minor deviations were reported .",
    "we can not , of course , trust the hrg model over the entire qcd phase diagram away from the chemical freeze - out line .",
    "it is obvious that the hrg should break down in the region of nuclear matter at low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath8 .",
    "nuclear physics at @xmath9 has revealed that a first - order phase transition of liquid - gas ( or liquid - vacuum at @xmath9 ) should take place at @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the nucleon mass and the binding energy @xmath13",
    "some years ago an interesting possibility was demonstrated  @xcite ; the chemical freeze - out condition at low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath8 could be rather sensitive to nuclear matter properties .",
    "the present work aims to pursue the idea along the same line to show the agreement for not only the chemical freeze - out condition but also the fluctuations .",
    "one might have an impression that the hrg is a sort of opposite to nuclear matter and one should abandon the hrg immediately to switch to the nuclear physics terrain .",
    "this intuition is not totally correct , however , and we know that the independent quasi - particle picture makes good sense inside of nuclei and nuclear matter . hence , on the formal level , the hrg - like model with `` renormalized '' parameters may have a chance to work continuously from low-@xmath8 to high-@xmath8 .",
    "indeed , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model of nuclear matter is designed in this spirit .",
    "the simplest setup of the rmf is the @xmath1-@xmath0 model  @xcite as was adopted in ref .",
    "this model deals with nucleons as relativistic quasi - particles moving in the scalar mean - field @xmath1 and the vector mean - field @xmath0 .",
    "i note that we can safely neglect @xmath14 fluctuations as long as we concern the baryon number at small @xmath7 .",
    "if needed , i can extend my present analysis so as to include @xmath14 fluctuations , for example , with the renormalization group improvement  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : i give a detailed description of fluctuations within the framework of the hrg model in sec .  [",
    "sec : hrg ] .",
    "then , based on the similarity to the hrg model , i introduce the rmf model in sec .",
    "[ sec : similarity ] and i present my central numerical results from the rmf model in sec .",
    "[ sec : central ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : suppression ] i give more considerations on the microscopic structures of my numerical results .",
    "i also cover discussions on the difference between the baryon number and the proton number to discover that the diffusion in isospin space does not affect my results as long as the boltzmann approximation makes sense , which is addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : isospin ] .",
    "i finally summarize this work in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "first of all , before going into the descriptions of the hrg model , i should elucidate physical observables of my interest .",
    "i follow the standard convention as used in ref .",
    "@xcite for thermal fluctuations which are derived from the derivatives of the pressure with respect to the relevant chemical potentials . for the baryon number fluctuation ,",
    "thus , i calculate the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath15 from which i can construct the mean value ( i.e. , the particle number ) ; @xmath16 . for an arbitrary distribution",
    "i can define the gaussian width @xmath17 together with the non - gaussian fluctuations such as the skewness @xmath18 and the kurtosis @xmath19 as  @xcite : @xmath20 therefore , once some theoretical estimates provide us with the pressure @xmath21 as a function of @xmath8 , i can give a prediction for these fluctuations under an assumption of the dominance of thermal fluctuations .",
    "second , to make a contact with the collision experiment , it is necessary to relate the collision energy @xmath22 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "fortunately , such parametrization of @xmath23 and @xmath24 has been well established along the chemical freeze - out line  @xcite that reads : @xmath25 where parameters are chosen as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 to reproduce experimentally observed particle yields .",
    "charge and strangeness chemical potentials , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are also parametrized in a similar manner . in my present analysis",
    ", i numerically checked that the inclusion of @xmath31 and @xmath32 hardly changes the fluctuation results , and so i neglect them for clarity of presentation .",
    "these definitions and parametrizations are robust and unchanged for any model applications .",
    "now i take a step toward the hrg model .",
    "let us start with a simple demonstration of free nucleon gas and then proceed to the realistic hrg model next . in the estimate with non - interacting hadrons ( in which the canonical factor @xmath33 is not included )",
    "i make use of the standard expression of the free grand canonical partition function .",
    "that is , the pressure from baryons ( fermions ) is prescribed as @xmath34    \\notag\\\\    & \\qquad\\qquad + \\ln\\bigl [ 1+e^{-(\\varepsilon_p+{\\mu_{\\text{b}}})/t } \\bigr ]    \\bigr\\ } \\;. \\label{eq : p_free}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 is @xmath36 for nucleons corresponding to the isospin degeneracy and the pressure depends on the nucleon mass @xmath37 through the energy dispersion relation : @xmath38 .",
    "i can then take the derivatives of the above expression , which results in @xmath39 where @xmath40 appears from the spin and the isospin degeneracy ( for @xmath41 ) and the integrands read : @xmath42 with @xmath43^{-1}$ ] and @xmath44^{-1}$ ] being the fermi - dirac distribution functions for nucleons and anti - nucleons .",
    "i can continue taking the derivatives for even larger @xmath45 if needed .            in the boltzmann approximation that is valid when @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both dilute",
    ", i can neglect the quantum statistical factors of non - linear @xmath46 and @xmath47 terms .",
    "then , i can approximate eq .",
    "as @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in this particular limit",
    "i can readily derive : @xmath50 which are nothing but the skellam expectations .",
    "i can easily generalize the above derivation of eq .   to a superposition of arbitrary @xmath35 with different masses to find that eq",
    ".   still holds after all .",
    "this is because @xmath51 is always factored out and the remaining integrand is common for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .    let us then quantify the breakdown of the boltzmann approximation explicitly by scanning the 3d landscape of @xmath55 and @xmath56 for various @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : hrgs ] and [ fig : hrgk ] we show our results from ( not a free nucleon gas but ) the hrg model using the particle data contained in the thermus2.3 package ( by red fine mesh ) as well as the skellam predictions ( by blue sparse mesh ) .",
    "it is clear from the figures that the quantum correlation certainly suppresses both @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the high - density region where @xmath46 is not really dilute .",
    "i should note that the hrg model can describe the onset behavior of finite baryon density but does not have dynamics enough to realize a first - order liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter ( and",
    "this is why i do not show hrg results at temperatures smaller than a few tens mev in figs .",
    "[ fig : hrgs ] and [ fig : hrgk ] ) .",
    "although this suppression effect is noticeable along the chemical freeze - out line as in figs .",
    "[ fig : skewness ] and [ fig : kurtosis ] , it is not sufficiently strong for reproducing the trend of the experimental data . in short ,",
    "the quantum correlation is weak , as correctly speculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , because the baryon density never gets large enough on the chemical freeze - out line .    to have a feeling about how the baryon density behaves on the chemical freeze - out line ,",
    "i shall make a plot of the integrated baryon density in the standard unit of @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] .",
    "the vertical thin lines correspond to the collision energy @xmath22 with spacing by @xmath58 .",
    "the lowest collision energy in fig .  [ fig : density ] starts with @xmath59 , and the maximum of the baryon density is found at @xmath60 .",
    "it is interesting that this maximum position precisely coincides with the triple - point - like region as speculated in ref .",
    "this coincidence is not accidental ; in ref .",
    "@xcite the triple - point - like region was recognized based on the horn structure in @xmath61 that is sensitive to the strangeness chemical potential ; @xmath32 .",
    "if the bulk system maintains zero strangeness , it is not hard to confirm that @xmath32 is almost proportional to @xmath8 within an effective model framework  @xcite . in this way , naturally , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , etc have a peak structure at @xmath64 with which the baryon density is maximized .     and @xmath8 .",
    "the nucleon contribution is nearly a half of shown results .",
    "the vertical lines represent the collision energy with spacing by @xmath58 .",
    "the extremal point corresponds to @xmath65 .",
    "the chemical freeze - out line is drawn according to eqs .   and .",
    "]    as a final related remark i point out that the effect of the strangeness and the charge conservation is only of a few percent order in @xmath55 and @xmath56 along the chemical freeze - out line .",
    "i have checked this numerically by adopting @xmath31 and @xmath32 parametrized along the chemical freeze - out line  @xcite .",
    "i then observed that @xmath55 and @xmath56 in figs .",
    "[ fig : skewness ] and [ fig : kurtosis ] are pushed down by a few percent at most as compared to the current @xmath66 case .",
    "this check justifies my discussions without @xmath31 and @xmath32 taken into account .",
    "it is nuclear matter ( that is a self - bound system of infinite nucleons ) that lies in the opposite limit to the non - interacting matter described by the hrg model .",
    "nevertheless , theoretically speaking , the formulation of nuclear matter , namely the rmf , is not such far from the hrg model or they actually share similarity to some extent .",
    "the simplest rmf is known as the @xmath1-@xmath0 model defined by the partition function : @xmath67 \\notag\\\\   & \\qquad + \\ln\\bigl [ 1+e^{-(\\varepsilon_p+{\\mu_{\\text{b}}}^\\ast)/t } \\bigr ] \\bigr\\ }    - \\frac{m_\\sigma^2 \\sigma^2}{2 } + \\frac{m_\\omega^2 \\omega^2}{2 } \\ ; , \\label{eq : rmf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quasi - particle dispersion relation is @xmath68 . here ,",
    "quantities with asterisk are `` in - medium '' or `` renormalized '' ones which contain a shift by the mean - field as @xmath69 these mean - fields of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , or equivalently , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are determined with the stationary conditions : @xmath72 , which lead to the gap equations . by choosing the model parameters appropriately  @xcite ;",
    "i.e. , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , we can reproduce the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter with the saturation density given by @xmath78 and the binding energy per nucleon given by @xmath79 .",
    "i note that this simplest @xmath1-@xmath0 model fails in reproducing the empirical value of the compressibility of symmetric nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to overcome this problem by extending the model with self - coupling potential of the mean - fields . for the fluctuations of my present interest",
    ", however , such improvement of the model makes only minor modifications on the final results  @xcite .",
    "this also implies that a different choice of @xmath80 , e.g.  @xmath81 would not change the final results because @xmath82 and @xmath83 should be readjusted to reproduce the saturation density and the binding energy , and so the difference would be the compressibility only .    from eq .",
    "it is obvious that the rmf estimate should reduce to nothing but the hrg estimate or eq .",
    "if i freeze the implicit dependence on @xmath8 through the solutions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , or equivalently , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in this sense we can interpret the rmf treatment as a variation of the hrg model augmented with mean - fields .",
    "unlike the hrg model , however , the mean - fields have implicit dependence on @xmath8 , from which i should anticipate non - trivial contributions for the fluctuations .    in closing of this section",
    ", i make an explicit statement about the validity regions of the hrg model and the rmf models .",
    "the hrg model is the most successful at the top energy of the rhic , but the agreement of the thermal model fit to the experimental data slightly becomes worse for the lhc data .",
    "there is no clear explanation for this , but it is conceivable that the hrg model works the best near the crossover region of deconfinement .",
    "the meson sector of the hrg model is a valid picture in a fictitious world of @xmath84 with which meson interactions would be turned off .",
    "the baryon sector behaves differently , however , and so the hrg model should naturally break down at high baryon density . a conservative estimate for",
    "this would suggest a validity region , @xmath85 , that corresponds to @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "the rmf model is supposed to describe nuclear matter which is reached at small @xmath22 , and the validity region is limited by my approximation to neglect pion fluctuations .",
    "although the effect of pions is indirect for the baryon number fluctuations , it could make a quantitative modification if the temperature is comparable to the pion mass .",
    "this condition would translate into the validity region @xmath87 in the energy unit .",
    "so , one may well expect that the hrg model at high energy should be taken over smoothly by the rmf model in the intermediate energy @xmath88 , which could be of course understood as another manifestation of the triple - point - like region  @xcite .",
    "by @xmath89 . ]    . the bands represent uncertainty from the freeze - out @xmath8 by @xmath89 . ]",
    "figures  [ fig : skewness ] and [ fig : kurtosis ] show my results for @xmath55 and @xmath56 estimated in the hrg ( green dotted line ) and in the rmf ( blue dashed line ) on top of the bes / star data ( red dots ) .",
    "i note that the parametrization of the chemical freeze - out line , and , may have some uncertainty particularly at small @xmath22 . to quantify the sensitivity i varied @xmath8 by @xmath89 to add the band on each line in figs .",
    "[ fig : skewness ] and [ fig : kurtosis ] .",
    "now let me briefly discuss particular two among the non - trivial features noticeable in these figures .",
    "one is that the hrg model may have a richer structure than the skellam distribution .",
    "actually it was clearly stated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the skellam predictions come from the boltzmann approximation .",
    "if the baryon density gets large , therefore , one naturally expects modifications on the distribution .",
    "more specifically , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : skewness ] and [ fig : kurtosis ] , the kurtosis is not necessarily the unity at small @xmath22 .",
    "this effect is not such substantial , but it would be interesting to reveal how the quantum correlation would affect the distribution in a wider region away from the chemical freeze - out line .",
    "the other is that @xmath56 in the rmf is suppressed at smaller @xmath22 thus larger @xmath8 .",
    "in fact the rmf - estimated @xmath56 happens to approach the experimental data .",
    "it is , of course , the interaction effect that modifies @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then , an immediate question that comes to my mind is which of @xmath1 and @xmath0 should be more responsible for the suppression seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurtosis ] .",
    "one may well consider that the in - medium effective mass can bring about the leading effect of the interactions , which is indeed the case whenever the hartree approximation works . in the present problem , as we will see in the next section , the situation is rather involved .",
    "because i take the @xmath8 derivatives to compute the baryon fluctuations , it turns out to be @xmath71 and thus @xmath0 that play the essential role for forming a peculiar shape of @xmath56 in fig .  [",
    "fig : kurtosis ] .",
    "therefore , my study , as i will explain later , brings me a conclusion that the renormalization of @xmath8 caused by @xmath0 suppresses @xmath56 , while the in - medium mass coupled with @xmath1 does the opposite .",
    "i comment that , in view of figs .",
    "[ fig : skewness ] and [ fig : kurtosis ] , the fluctuations grow up again when @xmath22 reaches below @xmath90 .",
    "this low-@xmath22 enhancement of the fluctuations is simply because of the criticality when the chemical freeze - out line hits the liquid - gas critical point of nuclear matter  @xcite that is located at @xmath91 and @xmath92 in my rmf setup .",
    "as i mentioned previously , if i fix @xmath70 and @xmath71 at the vacuum values ; i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath8 , and then take the @xmath8 derivatives , the results for @xmath55 and @xmath56 are identical to what is referred to by the hrg in figs .",
    "[ fig : skewness ] and [ fig : kurtosis ] , which i have numerically checked .",
    "they are not exactly the same because the genuine hrg results have contributions also from higher baryonic resonances .    if i include the in - medium mass effect only , the @xmath8 derivative hits the implicit dependence in @xmath46 and @xmath47 and , for example , the first derivative reads : @xmath93 in the boltzmann approximation . here",
    "@xmath94 represents @xmath95 .",
    "i find a similar expression for @xmath47 with an overall minus sign and with @xmath96 changed to @xmath97 .    at high density",
    "i can neglect the anti - particle contribution from @xmath47 , and moreover , @xmath94 is negative because the effective mass @xmath70 generally decreases with increasing density .",
    "this means that @xmath98 is _ greater _ than @xmath46 by an enhancement factor @xmath99 . in the approximation to neglect higher derivatives in terms of @xmath8 , therefore , @xmath55 and @xmath56 should get larger , respectively , by @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "in contrast to this behavior of @xmath70 , the effect of the renormalized chemical potential @xmath71 yields a suppression factor by @xmath102 where @xmath0 is proportional to the baryon density , so that i can conclude that @xmath103 .",
    "the above - mentioned arguments have been carefully confirmed in my numerical calculations .",
    "let us see the numerical check from a different view point .",
    "i change the strength of the vector coupling @xmath83 by hand to find that @xmath56 is certainly modified in a way consistent with the above qualitative arguments , as is transparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurtosis_test ] ; the entire curve goes down for larger @xmath83 .",
    "i should note , however , that i can not infer @xmath83 from a fit of the model results to the experimental data .",
    "this is because i simply vary @xmath83 not adjusting other parameters to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter . in this sense , thus , my results in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurtosis_test ] should not be regarded as anything beyond a test purpose .",
    "so far , i have discussed a quantitative comparison assuming that the experimentally measurable quantities of the proton number fluctuations are somehow to be identified as the baryon number fluctuations .",
    "one may have wondered if it really works or not .",
    "in fact such identification requires a non - trivial assumption about independence between neutrons and protons as is the case in the hrg calculation .",
    "one can readily understand this by expanding higher powers of @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are , respectively , the ( net ) proton number and the ( net ) neutron number .",
    "for the simplest example , the quadratic fluctuation consists of @xmath107 where @xmath108 if the proton and the neutron behave independently from their isospin partners , there is no connected contribution in the correlation function of @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; i.e. , @xmath109 and the last term involving @xmath110 in eq .   vanishes .",
    "as long as i do not consider isospin symmetry violation , the neutron fluctuation should be just identical with the proton fluctuation , so that i can conclude @xmath111 immediately from eq .  .",
    "i can continue similar arguments to deduce that @xmath112 in general .",
    "therefore , obviously , this factor 2 is canceled out in the dimensionless ratios and @xmath55 and @xmath56 of protons take the same value as those of baryons ( nucleons ) .",
    "this argument is valid as long as i consider a free gas of baryons only .",
    "it is known , however , that off - diagonal components of the susceptibility such as @xmath113 are non - vanishing as observed in the lattice - qcd simulation  @xcite as well as in the model studies  @xcite .",
    "i do not go into technical details here but simply note that non - zero @xmath114 is induced by different behavior of the polyakov loop and the anti - polyakov loop in a finite - density environment described by the polyakov - loop extended nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite . physically speaking",
    ", different flavors communicate to each other through confining gluons to form pions .",
    "it is important to mention that @xmath114 itself is finite also in the hrg calculation , which is attributed to pions rather than baryons .",
    "then , a non - zero @xmath110 of baryons should be induced by @xmath115 after all . since i can not avoid relying on another assumption to give a concrete estimate of induced @xmath110",
    ", i shall postpone numerical analyses along this line into another publication .",
    "recently a more dynamical origin of isospin correlations has been discussed in ref .",
    "that is , residual interactions after the chemical freeze - out can change @xmath21 into @xmath45 and vice versa .",
    "of course , in the first approximation , i do not have to think of weak processes because the life time of matter in the heavy - ion collision is of order of the strong interaction .",
    "still , such a mixing between @xmath116 is allowed by the strong interaction involving @xmath117 and @xmath118 through an intermediate state of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "it should be a quite complicated procedure to establish any reliable evaluation for these contributions to @xmath110 , but i can drastically simplify the theoretical calculation in the limit of complete mixing or randomization , that is the limit opposite to complete independence in isospin space .    in this special case of complete randomization of isospin , it is a natural anticipation to presume that each ( anti- ) nucleon is either a ( anti- ) proton or a ( anti- ) neutron with equal probability .",
    "therefore , the distribution of @xmath121 is the binomial one with the mean value given by @xmath122  @xcite , where @xmath121 and @xmath123 are not the net quantities but the _ absolute _ proton number and the _ absolute _ baryon ( nucleon ) number .",
    "that is , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , etc .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath123 and @xmath126 ( for which the average is denoted by @xmath127 ) , i expect : @xmath128 and so on according to the binomial distribution .",
    "i note that eqs .  -",
    "are @xmath7 independent unlike the thermal distribution .",
    "i am now ready to express the proton number fluctuations in terms of baryon ones . for @xmath45-th order fluctuation",
    "i have : @xmath129 where @xmath130 represents an average over the distribution of @xmath123 and @xmath126 .",
    "using these relations i can easily prove , for example , the following of the quadratic ( @xmath131 ) fluctuation : @xmath132 where i used independence of the baryon and the anti - baryon distributions .",
    "it should be noted that eq .   exactly coincides with the formula derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us see how large the second term could be , and for this purpose , i make use of an expression for the free baryon gas .",
    "then , i numerically confirm that this second term is very close to the first term at good precision ; i.e. , @xmath133 within 1% level at large @xmath22 and at most 5% level at smaller @xmath22 of a few gev .",
    "i can then approximate @xmath134 as @xmath135 .",
    "this means that both eq .   and",
    "the previous relation in the hrg model eventually lead to the same answer ; @xmath136 after all , though they superficially look quite different from each other .",
    "i next proceed to the @xmath137 case .",
    "then , after some calculations , i can arrive at : @xmath138 where i defined @xmath139 and @xmath140 as @xmath141 so , the ordinary quadratic fluctuation is given as @xmath142 .",
    "my result above is again equivalent to the formula listed in ref .",
    "it is also easy to check that this latter term in eq .",
    "gives the same answer as @xmath143 within a few % as long as the baryon distribution is thermal .",
    "therefore , @xmath144 follows .",
    "now i can make a guess that probably @xmath145 again and let us explicitly make it sure . in the same way i can write @xmath146 down as @xmath147 this is indeed close to @xmath148 but shows a deviation as @xmath22 gets smaller .",
    "i present our numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : isospin ] .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : isospin ] that @xmath145 is the case as long as @xmath22 is sufficiently large , while it increases by about 10% at smaller @xmath22 .",
    "my conclusion is that , contrary to what is claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the isospin correlation does not help us with explaining a suppression tendency in the kurtosis at smaller @xmath22 ; the effect is in a wrong direction . in any case",
    ", the 10% correction is just too minor to account for almost 50% suppression in the experimental data as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurtosis ] .     to @xmath149 which is close to @xmath150 and",
    "the deviation from @xmath150 is less than 10% at small @xmath22 . ]    here i make a remark that i can easily give a general proof of @xmath151 if i can make the boltzmann approximation for the baryon distribution .",
    "therefore , in this sense , the 10% deviation seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : isospin ] can be attributed to the violation of the boltzmann approximation that is quantified by the deviation from the unity in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurtosis ] , which is also of the 10% level .",
    "the bottom line of my analysis is that i can safely neglect the difference between the baryon number and the proton number fluctuations .",
    "i investigated the baryon number fluctuations using the hadron resonance gas model and the mean - field model of nuclear matter .",
    "i found that the mean - field description yields fairly good results which look quite consistent with the skewness and the kurtosis measured in the beam - energy scan .    because the mean - field approximation is based on the quasi - particle treatment , in fact , it is not much different from the hadron resonance gas model except for the interaction effects incorporated in terms of the scalar and the vector mean - fields .",
    "i numerically checked that the kurtosis is suppressed at smaller collision energy ( i.e. , higher baryon density ) due to the vector mean - field that is directly coupled to the baryon density .",
    "i would emphasize that my main point is to draw attention to a realistic possibility to interpret the bes data as an extrapolation from nuclear matter , and not to make a serious comparison between models and the experimental data . to this end",
    "i need to take account of canonicalness in a finite volume  @xcite and also diffusion effects in rapidity subspace  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the present study , i discussed the effects of isospin correlations and reached a conclusion that such effects are only minor such that i can ignore them in the first approximation . even in the case of strong residual interactions that realize complete randomization in isospin space",
    ", i found that the deviation from the hrg prediction is at most 10% at the smallest collision energy of a few gev .",
    "therefore , for a semi - quantitative estimate , i can simply identify the proton number fluctuations as ( a half of ) the baryon number fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "i only mentioned on another possibility of flavor mixing through the off - diagonal susceptibility : @xmath114 .",
    "this non - zero @xmath114 arises from the pion dynamics , and so it is quite non - trivial how we can relate @xmath114 to the correlations purely among the proton number @xmath105 and the neutron number @xmath106 .",
    "i am now making progress in this direction in order to refine relationship between @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "although the @xmath1-@xmath0 model is one of the simplest methods to capture the essential features of nuclear matter , it would be more desirable to develop quantitative investigations by means of more systematic approaches such as the chiral perturbation theory",
    ". it would be definitely worth attempting the fully quantitative comparisons for @xmath55 and @xmath56 within the framework of the chiral perturbation theory and also more established bruckner - type calculations .",
    "this is one of my future problems and the results shall be reported in follow - ups hopefully soon .",
