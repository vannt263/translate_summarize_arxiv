    "the processes converting the energy of relativistic electrons into flows of electromagnetic radiation with the help of single crystals are still of fundamental and practical interest in high - energy physics . in crystals the cross - sections of the high - energy electromagnetic processes can change essentially compared with the corresponding quantities for a single atom ( see , for instance , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the momentum transfer between a highly relativistic interacting particle and the crystal can be small , especially along the direction of particle motion .",
    "when this longitudinal momentum transfer is small , the uncertainty principle dictates that the interaction is spread out over a distance , known as the formation length for radiation or , more generally , as the coherence length .",
    "if the formation length exceeds the interatomic spacing , the interference effects from all atoms within this length are important and they can essentially affect the corresponding cross - sections . from the point of view of controlling the parameters of the high - energy electromagnetic processes in a medium it is of interest to investigate the influence of external fields , such as acoustic waves , temperature gradient etc .",

    "the coherent bremsstrahlung of high - energy electrons moving in a crystal is one of the most effective methods for producing of quasimonochromatic gamma - quanta and has been intensively investigated either theoretically and experimentally over the last decade ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . such radiation has a number of remarkable properties and at present it has found many important applications . among these is the generation of intense positron beams .",
    "the basic source to creating positrons for high - energy electron - positron colliders is the electron - positron pair creation by hard bremsstrahlung photons produced when a powerful electron beam hits an amorphous target .",
    "one possible approach to increase the positron production efficiency is to use a crystal target as a positron emitter ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when the crystal axis is aligned to the incident beam direction , intense photons are emitted through the coherent bremsstrahlung process and the channeling radiation process .",
    "these photons are then converted to electron - positron pairs in the same crystal , or in the amorphus target behind the crystal .",
    "the wide applications of the bremsstrahlung by relativistic particles motivate the importance of investigations for various mechanisms of controlling the radiation parameters . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the influence of a hypersonic wave on the coherent bremsstrahlung by relativistic electrons in a crystal .",
    "we specify the conditions under which the external deformation field changes noticeably the bremsstrahlung cross - section compared to the case of an undeformed crystal and demonstrate the possibility for the radiation yield enhancement .",
