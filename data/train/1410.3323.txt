    "as supermassive black hole binary ( smbhb ) systems coalesce they are expected to produce gravitational wave ( gw ) emission . at the time of coalescence",
    "a permanent change in the space - time metric will propagate away from the source @xcite .",
    "the permanent change is known as the  gravitational wave memory \" ( gwm ) effect . throughout this paper",
    "we mainly consider gwm events caused by smbhb coalescences .",
    "however , gwm events can also come from other sources such as cosmic strings , supernovae or during the flyby of massive objects ( pshirkov , baskaran & postnov 2010 ) .",
    "the passage of a gwm past the earth or a pulsar will cause a change in the observed frequency of that pulsar s rotation . by observing a sufficiently large number of stable millisecond pulsars it is expected that an unambiguous detection of the gwm effect could be made . in this paper",
    "we describe a gwm search algorithm and apply it to the recent parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) data set ( manchester et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "as part of the pulsar - timing technique ( for details , see edwards , hobbs & manchester 2006 ) , a  pulsar timing model \" is developed that describes the pulsar , its companions and the propagation of the pulses from the pulsar to the earth .",
    "the model predicts the pulse times of arrival ( toas ) in an inertial reference frame . in all current pulsar timing experiments this reference frame",
    "is taken to be the solar system barycentre .",
    "the barycentric toas are then compared with the predictions of the timing model and the differences are identified and termed the `` pulsar timing residuals '' .",
    "as gws are not , by default , included in the timing model , they will induce timing residuals .",
    "it is thought that observations of millisecond pulsars will lead to the direct detection of gws @xcite .",
    "a promising class of gw source potentially detectable through pulsar timing is a stochastic background , which could be generated by an ensemble of individually unresolvable inspiraling smbhbs scattered throughout the universe ( e.g. , sesana , vecchio & colacino , 2008 ) .",
    "such gws are inherently stochastic and will induce correlated noise - like structure in the timing residuals .",
    "other classes of gw sources are continuous waves generated by relatively nearby and massive inspiraling smbhbs ( sesana et al .",
    "2009 , ravi et al . 2012 ) and the gwm events ( e.g. , seto 2009 , pshirkov et al .",
    "2010 , van haasteren & levin 2010 , cordes & jenet 2012 ) that are the focus of this paper .",
    "such gw signals are deterministic and can be included in pulsar timing models .",
    "several observing programs have now been started with the goal of observing a large number of pulsars with sufficient precision to detect gw signals ( jenet et al .",
    "2009 ; ferdman et al .",
    "2010 ; manchester et al .",
    "such projects are known as pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) @xcite and currently three exist .",
    "the north american pta ( nanograv ; mclaughin 2013 ) was formed in 2007 and carries out observations with the arecibo and green bank telescopes . the european pulsar timing array ( epta",
    "; kramer & champion 2013 ) was established in 2004 and includes telescopes in england , france , germany , the netherlands and italy . for this paper",
    "we make use of data from the ppta project ( manchester et al .",
    "2013 ) which commenced in 2004 and uses the 64-m diameter parkes radio telescope .",
    "parkes observations have been used to place an upper bound on a stochastic background of gws ( shannon et al . , 2013 ) and to search for gw signals from individual , non - evolving , supermassive black hole binaries ( zhu et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "in this paper we focus on the gwm phenomenon .",
    "seto ( 2009 ) , van haasteren & levin ( 2010 ) and pshirkov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have independently shown that pulsar timing arrays would be sensitive to sufficiently strong gwm events .",
    "gwm events passing a pulsar will lead to a glitch event in the timing residuals of only that pulsar ( cordes & jenet , 2012 ) and may be indistinguishable from a rotational glitch .",
    "gwm events passing the earth will lead to simultaneous glitch events that are potentially detectable in the timing residuals of multiple pulsars in the array .",
    "the size and sign of the glitches will depend upon the angle between the source , earth and pulsar in a quadrupolar fashion .",
    "thus such events can be separated from rotational glitches in individual pulsars .    along with gws , many other physical phenomena are not included in the timing model and will also induce timing residuals that may mask the signals of interest .",
    "these include errors in the terrestrial time standard ( see e.g. , hobbs et al .",
    "2012 ) , errors in the solar system ephemeris ( e.g. , champion et al .",
    "2010 ) , and uncorrected dispersion measure variations ( see e.g. , keith et al .",
    "pulsars are also known to exhibit intrinsic variations in the timing residuals which include stochastic spin noise ( e.g. , shannon & cordes 2010 , hobbs et al .",
    "2010 ) and glitch events ( e.g. , yu et al . 2013 , cognard & backer 2004 ) .",
    "in this paper we try to answer the following four questions :    \\(i ) how can we detect gwm signals in pulsar data sets ?",
    "\\(ii ) do gwm signals exist in the parkes pulsar timing array data set ?",
    "\\(iii ) if no signal is detected then what is the maximum rate estimate of such gwm events ?",
    "\\(iv ) what are the astrophysical implications of this bound on the gwm amplitude ? in section 2 , we describe the observations used in this analysis . in section 3",
    ", we describe the gwm signal . in section 4",
    "we present our detection algorithm for searching and limiting the gwm signal and answer question ( i ) .",
    "in section 5 , we apply our algorithm to the ppta data and present the results , answering question ( ii ) . in section 6",
    "we discuss our results and their astrophysical implications .",
    "this leads to answers to questions ( iii ) and ( iv ) . in the appendix",
    "we describe updates made to the software package tempo2 needed for this work .",
    "we use the initial parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) data set ( manchester et al .",
    "this data set is available from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation ( csiro ) data archive and has a digital object identifier ( doi ) of 10.4225/08/534cc21379c12 .",
    "the raw observations that made up that data release are also available from the same website as part of the parkes pulsar data archive ( hobbs et al .",
    "2011 ) .    the data set includes regular observations of 20 millisecond pulsars at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks between the years 2005 and 2011",
    "for each pulsar , toas for the band that has the lowest over - all rms timing residuals after the data have been corrected for dispersion measure variations ( keith et al .",
    "2013 ) have been selected .",
    "all the observations were performed with the parkes 64-m radio telescope with typical integration times of 1hr .",
    "timing residuals were formed using the tempo2 software package ( hobbs et al .",
    "2006 ) making use of the jpl de421 solar system ephemeris ( folkner et al . 2008 ) and referred to terrestrial time as realised by the bureau international des poids et mesures ( bipm2011 ) .",
    "the post - fit timing residuals for the 20 pulsars are shown in figure  [ fg : residuals ] .",
    "the first three columns in table  [ tb : params ] provide , for each pulsar , its name , pulse period and dispersion measure .",
    "pulsar timing data sets vary significantly and we currently do not have a simple way to quantify the quality of different data sets .",
    "usually the weighted rms of the timing residuals is used .",
    "we present this value , @xmath0 , in column 4 .",
    "however , we note that pulsars scintillate and therefore some toas can have much larger uncertainties than other toas for the same pulsar .",
    "we therefore also present the unweighted rms timing residuals , @xmath1 , in column 5 .",
    "both of these statistics are affected by any non - white noise process in the data and so the uncertainties on individual toas are often significantly lower than the rms values . to quantify this , we give , in column 6 , the median toa uncertainty for each pulsar , @xmath2 , as measured during the toa determination procedure .",
    "below , we show that additional white noise , which is not described by the toa uncertainties , may also be present .",
    "after correction for such noise , the median uncertainty will be increased .",
    "this corrected median toa uncertainty , @xmath3 , is listed in column 7 of the table .",
    "the remaining three columns give the number of toas ( n@xmath4 ) , the dates of the first and last observations ( as modified julian dates , mjds ) and the data span respectively .
