    "since the work of stell and hemmer @xcite it has been appreciated that a simple model pair - potential with two repulsive regions of differing strength is capable of generating a third fluid phase . recent experimental and theoretical evidence for liquid - liquid phase transitions ( llpt ) in elemental melts @xcite has revived interest in these models as a mechanism for reproduction and study of the general phenomenon . in particular , it has been suggested by @xcite @xcite that so called ` core - softened ' potentials are capable of generating a first - order phase transition within a supercooled liquid .",
    "llpts of this kind are observed in many models of water @xcite and may be related to the celebrated density maximum at @xmath0 .",
    "the llpt is considered an extension of the transition between two amorphous ice phases into the supercooled liquid regime , ending in a critical point below the thermodynamic melting temperature .",
    "a continuous interpretation of a stell - hemmer like potential can be reproduced by the function    @xmath1 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&a\\exp\\left[-w\\left(r_{ij}-r_{0}\\right)^{2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which for appropriate choices of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 closely resembles the form suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite @xcite have presented a clear argument that potentials of this form posses an isostructural transition between either two solid or two liquid phases of different density .",
    "previous simulation studies have employed both the smooth form given by equation [ eq : shpots ] and a discrete piecewise interpretation . both",

    "[ fig : shpots ] . in two dimensions",
    "the observation of a water - like density anomaly has been reported in molecular dynamics simulations of both the smooth and discrete forms @xcite .",
    "other simulations have employed advanced monte - carlo methods @xcite . these indicate that rather than being related to a metastable llpt , the density anomaly is a consequence of cluster formation during quasi - continuous freezing to a solid of lower density than the surrounding liquid .    .",
    "the lennard - jones potential ( dotted line ) is shown for comparison . ]",
    "simulations in three dimensions have been largely limited to the discrete potential , and indicate a second critical point can occur for certain parameterisations @xcite , without a density anomaly .",
    "this metastable second critical point can lie at higher or lower temperature than the liquid - gas critical point depending upon the specific parameterisation employed .",
    "previous simulations of the _ smooth _ potential in three dimension have been restricted to two limited studies @xcite . in a recent rapid communication @xcite , we mapped the low pressure portion of the three - dimensional phase diagram for @xmath5 .",
    "a simple hexagonal ( sh ) solid phase , identified using the meta - dynamics method of @xcite @xcite , was shown to remain thermodynamically stable in this regime . in this paper",
    "we report on calculations for a range of @xmath2 values , studying the emergence of the sh phase .",
    "the sh to close packed transition at high pressures is studied .",
    "in addition we follow the behaviour of the melting and liquid - vapour critical temperatures as a function of the outer well depth .",
    "the possibility of isostructural phase transitions is also investigated .",
    "measured quantities are presented here in the usual dimensionless reduced units .",
    "energies are quoted as multiples of the inner - well depth @xmath6 , lengths as multiples of @xmath7 . reduced temperature @xmath8 is calculated as @xmath9 , with pressure @xmath10 .",
    "time is measured in units @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the atomic mass . for all studies reported here the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are used in equation [ eq : shpots ] .",
    "the pair - potential is truncated at @xmath15 and _ force_-shifted such that no discontinuities occur in the dynamics .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : zerot ] we explore the zero temperature phase behaviour as a function of the outer well depth @xmath2 and choose values for study at finite temperature . in section [ sec : methods ] we describe the methods employed for our finite temperature studies .",
    "results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we summarise our findings .",
    "much insight into the phase behaviour of a model substance can be extracted from zero temperature enthalpy and volume characteristics .",
    "the zero temperature energy is obtained by performing a conjugate - gradient ( cg ) minimisation of the potential energy @xmath16 with respect to both the cell vectors and the fractional atomic coordinates .",
    "our identification of candidate structures was reported in ref .",

    "the final two structures are stabilised by the outer well only for @xmath17 .",
    "the energetic favourability of open structures on increasing @xmath2 can be understood in terms of neighbour distances .",
    "the sh primitive cell is defined by @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20,@xmath21 .",
    "the nearest and second nearest neighbours lie at a distance @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , close to the position of the lennard - jones minimum , while the third nearest lie at @xmath24 which is very close to @xmath3 .",
    "both energy minima in the pair potential are therefore utilised . in the sc structure ,",
    "nearest neighbours lie at approximately @xmath25 .",
    "the favourability of sc over the high density close packed structures stems from second nearest neighbours which lie at @xmath26 times this distance , which is close to @xmath3 .",

    "this compares to eight and twelve in the sh case which is therefore lower in energy .",

    "our method closely follows that described in detail by @xcite @xcite . a starting point on the liquid - vapour coexistence curve",
    "is obtained from the above estimate of critical temperature by fine tuning of the chemical potential @xmath31 until a bimodal distribution is measured in the particle number @xmath32 , with equal area in each peak .",
    "this is then re - weighted to a lower temperature , providing a biasing function for multi - canonical sampling .",
    "the process repeats , proceeding down the coexistence curve in steps of @xmath33 . at each step a multi - canonical gce simulation of @xmath34 @xmath35 monte - carlo cycles",
    "is sampled at equilibrium to produce the particle number histogram .",
    "a cubic simulation cell of side @xmath36 is employed in all cases .",
    "typically twenty steps are employed , tracing the curve over a temperature range of approximately @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting data is used to estimate the parameters of the liquid - gas critical point .    at lower temperatures",
    "the liquid - vapour curve is traced by numerical integration of the clausius - clapeyron equation ( see below ) .",
    "these are located via free energy calculation of both phases along an appropriately chosen isotherm .",
    "free energies are calculated using the einstein crystal method of frenkel and ladd @xcite . here",
    "the free energy derivative is integrated by sampling typically @xmath38 points along the path connecting the core - softened solid to the reference harmonic crystal , using canonical ensemble langevin dynamics simulations .",

    "this has been largely compensated for with repeat integrations at larger @xmath32 .",
    "the free energy is then extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via the method of @xcite @xcite .",
    "the second arises from finite - size effects in the identified density at a given pressure . a selection of repeat free energy calculations at densities obtained from larger system sizes",
    "have shown this to be negligible . in both cases the additional system sizes used are @xmath43 and @xmath44 for fcc , @xmath45 and @xmath44 for sh .",
    "free energy calculations of hcp and sc structures are also reported below , but are not used in locating phase boundaries .",
    "no finite size analysis has been performed in these cases . system sizes used are @xmath46 for hcp , and @xmath47 for sc .",

    "a cell is prepared with @xmath34 atoms in each phase and simulated at a specified temperature and pressure for @xmath50 . during this time the system transforms to a pure solid or liquid state .",
    "a series of these simulations allow the melting temperature to be accurately bracketed .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath49 method requires a single simulation to locate the melting temperature at a specified pressure @xcite .",
    "provided the initial enthalpy of the system lies close to that at the melting temperature , fractions of the system will melt or solidify , shifting portions of the conserved enthalpy between the two phases .",
    "the thermodynamic melting temperature is obtained at equilibrium .",
    "we note that @xmath49 simulations employing an andersen - hoover @xcite or ( as in this work ) a martyna - tobias - klein @xcite barostat , the enthalpy is _ not _ exactly conserved , but is constant to within fluctuations in the fictitious kinetic energy associated with the cell dynamics .",
    "this pseudo - nph approach is therefore only useful in cases where this fluctuation can be kept within the latent heat per atom associated with the melting transition .",

    "these gce simulations employ @xmath34 @xmath35 mc cycles in a cubic simulation cell of side @xmath53 .",
    "liquid free energies along the isobar of interest are obtained using thermodynamic integration to the density ( identified using constant pressure langevin dynamics simulations as for the solid ) and temperature of interest .",

    "the sh - fcc transition was located by the same procedure as in section [ sec : aeqeps ] .",
    "the zero temperature transition is located by cg enthalpy minimisation at @xmath152 .",
    "the transition along the @xmath151 isotherm was then determined by computing the free energy of both phases at ten pressures between @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the transition is located at @xmath155 .",
    "the estimated error in this pressure is of order @xmath150 .",
    "the sh and fcc melting temperature were sought along the @xmath123 and @xmath156 isobars respectively .",
    "no two - phase simulations were performed in this case . a suitable range over which to perform free energy calculations",
    "was estimated from trends in earlier data .",
    "a reference point at @xmath124 with @xmath125 was used in computing liquid free energies along both isobars .",
    "grand canonical monte - carlo simulation provides @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , leading to a helmholtz free energy of @xmath159 per atom .",
    "free energy plots along each isobar locate the sh melting temperature as @xmath160 , with the fcc melting at @xmath161 . in both cases",

    "pressure - temperature and temperature - density projections are shown .",
    "the maximum in the sh melting curve is clearly visible .",
    "the dashed line indicates the metastable isostructural transition .",
    "an increase in both melting and critical temperatures is observed over the @xmath5 case . ]",
    "gibbs - duhem series for the sh - fcc , sh - liquid and fcc - liquid transitions have been computed to trace the remainder of the phase diagram . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sh4fullphase ] , the sh melting curve maximum now lies within the stable regime .",
    "the fcc melting curve intersects at slightly higher temperature .",
    "there is hence a small range visible in both the temperature - pressure and temperature - density projections for which melting is reentrant . the metastable fcc - fcc transition is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sh4fullphase ] .",
    "the termination of this lies well below the melting temperature .",
    "in mapping the above phase diagrams , no evidence of a thermodynamically stable liquid - liquid phase transition has emerged . in particular data from gibbs - duhem integration reveal that density is continuous along the liquid side of all melting and vaporisation curves .",
    "in addition no third fluid peak has emerged during multi - canonical sampling .",
    "a stable llpt must meet either the melting or vaporisation curves at a triple point and can hence be ruled out .",
    "the possibility of liquid anomalies has been investigated with a considerable number of constant pressure langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "particular attention has been focused on the @xmath137 liquid , in the region where the solid is less dense than the liquid .",
    "a total of 74 simulations have been conducted over the range @xmath162 to @xmath163 , @xmath164 to @xmath165 .",
    "each simulation is of duration @xmath166 at equilibrium with a system size @xmath43 .",
    "no anomalies are observed in the density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : denmax ] ) , heat capacity , bulk modulus or diffusion coefficient .",
    "this is to be expected .",
    "in contrast to the two - dimensional case in ref @xcite , the melting transition is highly first - order .",
    "nucleation of solid clusters is therefore strongly inhibited by finite - size effects .",
    "accelerated sampling methods may prove useful in this region .    .",
    "density against temperature along several isobars is shown with accompanying error bars . ]",
    "it should be noted that the isostructural transition in the @xmath137 potential terminates at the ld - fcc spinodal line _ below _ the glass temperature .",
    "this has been located using the method in ref @xcite as @xmath167 at @xmath168 .",
    "no influence on the supercooled liquid is therefore expected .",
    "this is confirmed by a sequence of @xmath169 , @xmath43 simulations ( also of duration @xmath166 ) along the @xmath170 and @xmath171 isotherms .",
    "no anomalies or evidence of a llpt are found in the metastable liquid .",
    "finally , we briefly examine the structure of the liquid .. the pair correlation function @xmath172 was computed under a variety of conditions and studied as a function of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "results at @xmath173 are shown in figure [ fig : rdfs ] for densities @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "these were computed from canonical ensemble molecular dynamics simulations using @xmath34 atoms over a duration of @xmath176 .    at the lower density ,",
    "increasing the depth of the gaussian well leads to the emergence of a peak not present in the lennard - jones ( @xmath177 ) case .",
    "this corresponds to an coordination shell lying at an intermediate radial distance between the first and second lennard - jones shells .",
    "the occupation of this shell occurs at the expense of the innermost peak .",
    "the effect of increasing the @xmath2 parameter is hence to shift a significant fraction of first - nearest neighbors into the intermediate coordination shell .",
    "the second lennard - jones coordination shell is seemingly unaffected .    at the higher density ,",
    "the first coordination shell is unchanged on increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the intermediate peak is less pronounced and emerges at the expense of narrowing the second lennard - jones coordination shell .",
    "simulations at intermediate densities indicate that although significant , the change in liquid structure occurs continuously and does not correspond to a phase transition .     with @xmath2 at two densities . in each case",
    "the temperature is @xmath173 . ]",
    "we have mapped the liquid - gas , melting and solid - solid transitions in a sequence of core - softened pair potentials with increasing outer well strengths .",
    "the liquid - gas critical temperature has been seen to increase approximately quadratically with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the pressure of the critical point also increases .",
    "as @xmath2 is initially increased , the fcc melting temperature is found to reduce , perhaps contrary to the expected behaviour .",
    "this decrease in melting temperature can be understood by examining fig .",
    "[ fig : shpots ] . for @xmath2 values in this region ,",
    "the effect of the gaussian is to widen the existing lennard - jones minimum .",
    "this allows larger fluctuations about equilibrium lattice positions for a given temperature .",
    "the well known empirical rule of lindemann @xcite states that melting will occur when the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation is @xmath178 of the nearest - neighbour distance .",
    "this will occur at lower temperatures for wider potential wells .",
    "as the gaussian outer minimum becomes distinct from the lennard - jones minimum , the simple hexagonal structure becomes lower in energy due to a large number of third - nearest neighbours close to @xmath3 .",
    "a transition to fcc under pressure has been observed and is seen to intersect the melting line .",
    "the resulting simple hexagonal melting temperature increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the pressure of the sh - fcc transition increases with increasing @xmath2 , as expected from the larger enthalpy difference .",
    "we have also seen that the sh structure exhibits a maximum melting temperature , which for larger @xmath2 values is manifested in the thermodynamically stable regime .",
    "the predicted isostructural transition has been observed for the fcc structure only .",
    "energy minima are in fact also observed for two volumes when imposing simple cubic symmetry .",
    "the higher energy structure is however mechanically unstable when atoms are permitted to move away from lattice sites .",
    "the fcc - fcc transition does not approach the melting line .",
    "the low pressure phase diagram and sublimation have not been studied here .",
    "the phase behaviour is expected to be unchanged from the lennard - jones case in this region .",
    "the hexagonal close - packed structure has also not been studied in detail . for the range of parameters studied the fcc - fcc transition is not resolvable with the methods used here .",
    "the solid should be considered ` close - packed ' in regions where the fcc structure has been calculated as energetically favourable .",
    "we note that the lattice - switch monte - carlo method @xcite has recently been employed to resolve the fcc - hcp transition in the lennard - jones potential @xcite and could be used to similar effect in these systems .",
    "the two dominant sources of error in this study are the finite - size error in the solid and the statistical error associated with computing a liquid reference point for thermodynamic integration .",
    "the former has been largely corrected for by repeat calculations with larger system sizes .",
    "the latter dominates over the liquid finite - size error , but has been controlled to an acceptably low level .",
    "all phase boundaries shown can be considered accurate to within temperatures of @xmath179 and pressures of @xmath180 .",
    "the failure of the isostructural fcc - fcc transition to extend into the supercooled liquid suggests that potentials of this _ specific _ function form ( lennard - jones plus gaussian ) are _ not _ capable of reproducing the unusual phase behaviour of water .",
    "variation of the outer well position and width may yield significantly different phase behaviour to that reported here .",
    "the range of parameters over which the energetic ordering of phases is unchanged is currently under investigation .",
    "the temperature difference between the ld - fcc spinodal and the glass transition is small . it may therefore be possible to extend the fcc - fcc transition beyond the glass temperature using small changes within this parameter range",
    "financial support for this research has been partly provided by an epsrc studentship .",
    "computational facilities were provided under epsrc grant r47769 .",
