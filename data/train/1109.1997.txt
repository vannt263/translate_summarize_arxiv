    "the interplay between long - range correlations of turbulent fluctuations , radial electric fields and edge bifurcations in fusion plasmas has received recent interest in the form of various experimental studies @xcite .",
    "this interest is motivated by a missing mechanism behind the formation of edge transport barriers at the transition from l- to h - mode plasma states . the central link between appearence of radial electric field @xmath0 and associated sheared @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 flows to suppression of small - scale turbulence , the reduction in turbulent transport , and a steepening of the pedestal profile , is generally accepted  @xcite .",

    "the influence of single possible players behind the formation of long - range correlations can not always easily be determined by experiments , but may be straightforwardly studied with numerical simulation . in this work ,",
    "local drift - alfvn flux - tube turbulence computations are applied to analyse correlation statistics for various l - mode parameters in scalings that are characteristic for the approach to the h - mode . in particular , scaling effects by the background density gradient length , the collisionality , the plasma beta , an imposed @xmath3@xmath1@xmath2 shear flow and zonal flows on correlation statistics are studied .",
