    "an operator @xmath0 is a projector if it is idempotent , i.e. , if it is endowed with property @xmath1 .",
    "the projection is along ( or parallel to ) its null space @xmath2 and onto its range @xmath3 .",
    "this entails that @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "if the subspaces @xmath3 and @xmath2 are orthogonal the operator is called an orthogonal projector , which is the case if and only if @xmath0 is self - adjoint .",
    "otherwise it is called oblique projector .",
    "oblique projectors , though introduced early @xcite , have received less attention than orthogonal projectors .",
    "nevertheless , quite recently there has been a renewed interest in relation to their properties and applications @xcite . in particular ,",
    "oblique projectors have been shown to be of significant relevance to signal processing techniques @xcite .",
    "the present effort is very much motivated by problems arising in the area of signal representation outside the traditional orthogonal basis setting @xcite .",
    "in such a context a signal @xmath8 , represented mathematically as an element of a vector space , is approximated as a linear expansion of the form [ eq1 ] f^k=_i=1^k c_i v_i .",
    "the vectors @xmath9 in are sometimes sequentially fed or chosen according to some optimality criterion . in such situations one needs to be in a position to effectively adapt the coefficients of the linear superposition so as to account for the possibility of changes in the model .",
    "this may entail a)increasing the order @xmath10 of the model by incorporating new terms in the expansion b)reducing the order by eliminating some terms in the expansion c)replacing some of the vectors in by different ones .",
    "assuming that the signal space is an inner product space , for @xmath11 given in to be the best approximation of a signal @xmath8 in a minimum distance sense , the coefficients in should be calculated in such a way that @xmath11 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath8 onto @xmath12 .",
    "this is the main reason for the popularity of orthogonal projectors in the context of approximation techniques .",
    "nevertheless , suppose that the observed signal is produced by the interference of two phenomena so that the model becomes [ eq2 ] _",

    "i=1^n d_i w_i .",
    "if one were interested in discriminating the phenomena by splitting the signal , the component in @xmath12 could be obtained by an oblique projection operation mapping the other component to zero .",
    "there is a broad range of applications in which this procedure happens to be of assistance @xcite .",
    "thus , we felt motivated to find recursive equations for adapting oblique projectors .",
    "some of the equations to be proposed here are inspired by our previous work on recursive biorthogonalization for orthogonal projectors representation @xcite .",
    "we have recently been made aware that such a work is closely related to earlier one on recursive generalized inverses @xcite .    in spite of the fact that for most numerical implementations a projector is represented by a matrix , we prefer to think of projectors as operators acting by performing inner products . an important reason for this choice is the following : the equations can thereby be applied in general inner product spaces and comprise two very important cases in particular .",
    "namely , the euclidean inner product space , where a projector is indeed a matrix , and the space of functions of finite 2-norm .",
    "we like to see the proposed recursive equations as generalized gram - schmidt like procedures for generating sequences in inner product spaces .",
    "such sequences give rise to oblique projectors onto nested subspaces and , of course , to orthogonal projectors as special case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec2 ] introduces the notation along with a discussion on the general construction of oblique projectors .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] provides the recursive equations for stepwise updating / downdating of such projectors .",
    "applications are illustrated in section  [ num ] by i)recovering a simulated x - ray diffraction peak from a background and ii)filtering impulsive noise from the register of the motion of a system consisting of the superposition of damped harmonic oscillators .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section  [ con ] .",
