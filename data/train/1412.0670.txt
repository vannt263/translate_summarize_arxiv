    "the neutrino and antineutrino flux spectra emitted by a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) significantly depend on flavor .",
    "therefore , flavor conversion can strongly modify what neutrinos do after decoupling , notably in driving the explosion , determining nucleosynthesis yields in the neutrino - driven wind , and the expected signal in large - scale detectors @xcite . even though neutrino mixing angles are large , in a dense medium the eigenstates of propagation and those of interaction are very nearly the same  @xcite .",
    "therefore , significant flavor conversion would only occur by the msw effect  @xcite at a large distance from the collapsed core .",
    "this situation can fundamentally change when taking neutrino - neutrino refraction into account  @xcite .",
    "it can lead to self - induced flavor conversion  @xcite even when the matter density is large and therefore the effective mixing angle is small @xcite .",
    "the propagation eigenmodes of the collective neutrino ensemble include run - away solutions in flavor space  @xcite , leading to this phenomenon .",
    "one question is if self - induced flavor conversion would occur in regions below the stalled shock wave during the sn accretion phase .",
    "flavor conversion could then modify neutrino energy deposition and impact the explosion dynamics in the framework of the neutrino - driven mechanism of sn explosion .",
    "while self - induced flavor conversion can occur at much higher density than msw conversion , it is still suppressed by the `` multi - angle matter effect '' @xcite , although the exact conditions where conversions would occur require a linearized stability analysis or a numerical solution of the neutrino - flavor equations of motion .",
    "dedicated studies , using one - dimensional ( 1d ) sn models found that the `` onset radius '' of self - induced flavor conversion would always lie beyond the shock front where matter densities are much smaller  @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies using other sn models found similar results  @xcite .",
    "since that time , our theoretical understanding of both self - induced flavor conversion and of flavor - dependent sn neutrino emission have both evolved .",
    "we are here especially concerned with developments having to do with spontaneous breaking of symmetries that were previously taken for granted .",
    "axial symmetry of the neutrino radiation field around a given radial direction had been assumed in studies of collective flavor oscillations .",
    "however , a new class of run - away solutions breaks this symmetry spontaneously , allowing self - induced flavor conversion for both neutrino mass orderings  @xcite .",
    "moreover , spatial uniformity can also be broken spontaneously , leading to small - scale instabilities  @xcite . however , very recently it was shown that in the sn context , after including multi - angle matter effects , the uniform mode provides the most sensitive test for instability  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our present study we do not worry about small - scale instabilities when addressing the impact of an unusually small lepton - number flux .",
    "the other new finding is that sn neutrino emission in 3d models can develop a global dipole pattern termed lesa for lepton emission self - sustained asymmetry @xcite . while the overall neutrino luminosity remains nearly spherically symmetric , the deleptonization flux ( @xmath0 minus @xmath4 ) develops a strong dipole pattern within the first @xmath5150  ms after collapse irrespective of other hydrodynamical instabilities , notably even in the presence of the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) .",
    "more recent 3d models of the garching group @xcite as well as the oak ridge group @xcite show explosions . while all garching models exhibit the lesa effect very clearly and suggest that it persists at least until some 100  ms after the onset of the explosion  @xcite , the 3d explosion model of oak ridge shows a less stationary dipole with an amplitude of just about 10% of the monopole over most of the pre - explosion evolution and a more lesa - like episode with a dipole - to - monopole ratio of @xmath525% and stable direction only in a time interval between 360 and 410  ms after bounce  @xcite .",
    "the reason for these differences between the garching and oak ridge models is not clear yet , but they may be connected to different structural or transport conditions in the newly formed neutron star .",
    "the lesa phenomenon , when it is fully developed , implies that during the accretion phase , the deleptonization flux emerges primarily in one hemisphere . in some directions of the opposite hemisphere",
    ", it can be very small and sometimes even slightly negative .",
    "one may wonder if an unusually small lepton - number flux would facilitate self - induced flavor conversion , perhaps even below the shock front , and thus would require a fundamental re - examination of neutrino heating in directions of small lepton - number flux .",
    "for isotropic neutrinos or sn neutrinos in the single - angle approximation , self - induced flavor conversion is unavoidable in a @xmath0-@xmath4 symmetric ensemble  @xcite . on the other hand , multi - angle effects caused by matter or even by neutrinos themselves",
    "can suppress the instability .",
    "the main purpose of our work is a parametric study of the impact of the @xmath0-@xmath4 flux asymmetry on self - induced flavor conversion .",
    "we use a linearized stability analysis , where we neglect several issues that have been discussed in the recent literature .",
    "we ignore spin - flip effects caused by neutrino magnetic dipole moments @xcite or simply by refraction in inhomogeneous or anisotropic media @xcite , and we ignore the role of anomalous neutrino - antineutrino pair correlations @xcite .",
    "realistically , all of these are probably small effects",
    ". it could be more questionable that we also ignore the `` halo flux '' produced by residual scattering beyond the neutrino sphere and especially its `` backward going '' component @xcite .",
    "moreover , we do not worry about the question if our assumed quasi - stationary neutrino source indeed produces a quasi - stationary solution .",
    "a true assessment of these latter assumptions requires a deeper conceptual development irrespective of the lesa context .",

    "the flavor - dependent sn neutrino fluxes depend , at a given radius @xmath6 , on energy @xmath7 .",
    "the neutrino direction of propagation in the transverse direction is described by the zenith angle @xmath8 relative to the radial direction and by the azimuth angle @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the fluxes do not depend on coordinates in the transverse direction .",
    "the impact of small - scale variations in the transverse direction was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with the result that , for a stability analysis , the largest - scale modes are most relevant .",
    "we use a very basic `` neutrino bulb model '' to describe the initial fluxes , i.e. , we assume that neutrinos are produced at a spherical surface with radius @xmath10 and emitted isotropically ( blackbody like ) into the outside half - space .",
    "it is convenient to describe the zenith direction with a fixed label @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the zenith angle at radius @xmath10 .",
    "our blackbody like emission model corresponds to a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath13 .",
    "we stress that our reference radius @xmath10 is not a physical quantity but a quantity of mathematical convenience .",
    "it need not coincide with the neutrino sphere @xmath14 where typical neutrinos decouple and which is the physical emission region .",
    "neutrinos emerging at @xmath14 tend to show a forward - peaked zenith - angle distribution .",
    "the approximate width of this distribution provides us with the approximate radius @xmath10 of a hypothetical blackbody surface that would produce a flux with similar angular divergence .",
    "our main point of convenience is to use a @xmath15 distribution on the unit interval and we define @xmath10 accordingly .",
    "notice that we do not integrate the flavor evolution equations , but the philosophy of the stability analysis is to assume that nothing happens until our chosen test radius @xmath6 , i.e. , neutrinos have remained in flavor eigenstates which coincide with propagation eigenstates in a dense medium .",
    "therefore , the exact path taken before reaching the radius @xmath6 is irrelevant .",
    "we only need to know the flavor - dependent number fluxes and their angular divergence at radius @xmath6 .",
    "we combine the flavor - dependent fluxes , assumed to be stationary , into a matrix @xmath16 which depends on the variables denoted by subscripts .",
    "matrices in flavor space are written as capital sans - serif letters .",
    "the diagonal entries are the @xmath17 equivalent ordinary neutrino fluxes @xmath18 for species",
    "notice that @xmath18 is differential with regard to energy @xmath7 , i.e. , it is a flux spectrum , and it is also differential with regard to the zenith - angle variable @xmath15 and the azimuth angle @xmath9 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of @xmath20 contain flavor coherence information .",
    "we use negative energies @xmath7 and negative flux values @xmath18 to denote antineutrinos . this `` flavor isospin convention ''",
    "considerably simplifies the analysis because we do not need to distinguish explicitly between neutrinos and antineutrinos in the equations .",
    "however , this notation can also be confusing .",
    "@xmath21 is a positive number for a positive @xmath7 , but a negative number for negative @xmath7 and then denotes the antineutrino flux in the sense that @xmath22 if we take @xmath23 to be the usual positive - valued @xmath4 flux .    assuming that the solution does not depend on global direction , the radial evolution is given by  @xcite @xmath24\\ , , \\label{eq : eom1}\\ ] ] where we have suppressed the index @xmath6 on all quantities .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix governing the evolution is @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the neutrino mass - squared matrix , causing vacuum oscillations .",
    "the factor @xmath27 arises from projecting the propagation path onto the radial direction .",
    "this factor causes the multi - angle matter effect : neutrinos traveling in different directions accrue different phases along the radial direction .",
    "the matter term is given by the matrix @xmath28 of net charged - lepton densities which is diagonal in the weak - interaction basis .",
    "the third term represents neutrino - neutrino refraction which is given by the phase - space integral @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is understood as @xmath31 at radius @xmath6 .",
    "the radial velocity of a given mode is @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the transverse velocity @xmath33 depends on the azimuth angle @xmath9 .",
    "one finds @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we restrict our stability analysis to a two - flavor system and express the flux matrices in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is real , @xmath38 complex , and @xmath39 .",
    "the fluxes with superscript @xmath10 are the ones at radius @xmath10 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "since the overall neutrino flux is conserved , the trace term is conserved and drops out of the commutator equation .",
    "because the @xmath42 are @xmath17 equivalent fluxes , they do not decrease with distance , only the flavor content evolves .",
    "the flavor evolution is encoded in the normalized matrix @xmath43 .",
    "next we change the energy variable @xmath7 to the frequency variable @xmath44 which is more convenient in the flavor oscillation context .",
    "negative @xmath45 values denote antineutrino modes of the neutrino field .",
    "we imagine that self - induced flavor conversion is driven by the atmospheric mass difference .",
    "our sign convention is such that a positive @xmath46 refers to inverted mass ordering .",
    "actually we will always assume @xmath46 to be a positive parameter and will explain later on how to implement normal mass ordering in our equations .    as far as flavor conversion is concerned , what enters is the two - flavor flux difference @xmath47 , not the individual flavor fluxes .",
    "therefore , it proves useful to introduce a dimensionless neutrino spectrum in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and all fluxes depend on @xmath45 , @xmath15 , and @xmath9 , and @xmath50 we recall that antineutrino fluxes in the flavor - isospin convention are negative and that typically the @xmath0 flux is larger than the @xmath51 flux , and similar for antineutrinos .",
    "therefore , in the sn context , @xmath49 is typically positive for positive @xmath45 ( neutrinos ) and negative for negative @xmath45 ( antineutrinos ) , although the opposite sign can appear for some range of @xmath45 , corresponding to a `` crossed over '' number flux between @xmath0 and @xmath51 .",
    "our normalization differs from our previous studies where we often used in the denominator , i.e. , the total number flux of @xmath4 minus that of @xmath52 .",
    "however , in the maximal lepton - flux direction of our 3d models , this quantity becomes very small or even vanishes and thus can not be used to normalize other fluxes . moreover ,",
    "our new definition is more symmetric and more intuitive .    with the spectrum thus normalized , we define the asymmetry parameter as @xmath53 if we denote with @xmath54 the total positive number flux for neutrinos or antineutrinos @xmath19 , the asymmetry parameter corresponds to @xmath55 in the sn context we have approximately @xmath56 , further simplifying this expression .",
    "the normalization in our previous papers was @xmath57 in this notation .",
    "the main point of our study is to investigate how flavor stability depends on the asymmetry parameter @xmath58 . in the lesa context",
    ", we have a strong lepton - number flux dipole , whereas the @xmath0 plus @xmath4 and the @xmath51 plus @xmath52 fluxes remain nearly @xmath17 symmetric , i.e. , the denominator in our definition of @xmath58 is nearly independent of direction .",
    "we finally linearize the equations of motion in two ways .",
    "we assume @xmath59 as we want to investigate exponentially growing modes in @xmath38 , implying @xmath40 to linear order .",
    "furthermore , we use the large - distance approximation , @xmath60 , leading to  @xcite , @xmath61 s   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\mu \\int   d \\gamma^\\prime [ u + u^\\prime - 2\\sqrt{u u^\\prime } \\cos ( \\varphi-\\varphi^\\prime)]g^\\prime s^\\prime \\label{eq : lin } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 depends on @xmath45 , @xmath15 and @xmath9 , whereas @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend on @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we then seek eigenvalues @xmath67 for solutions of the form @xmath68 , where a positive imaginary part @xmath69 reflects unstable solutions .",
    "the effective multi - angle strength of the neutrino - neutrino and neutrino - matter interaction are described by the parameters    [ eq : mu - lambda - def ] @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the net electron density ( @xmath72 minus @xmath73 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath74 is the @xmath0 density at radius @xmath6 and @xmath75 is the @xmath4 number density .",
    "therefore , in the definition of @xmath76 , besides subtracting the @xmath51 and @xmath52 densities , we use the sum @xmath77 to describe the neutrino matter effect .",
    "our definition of @xmath76 differs somewhat from the previous literature , corresponding to our modified definition of @xmath49 .",
    "what enters in the equations is the combination @xmath78 , which is independent of chosen normalizations of either quantity .    in the lesa context ,",
    "the total number fluxes @xmath79 and @xmath80 are almost @xmath17 symmetric .",
    "therefore , our new normalization of @xmath76 implies that it is nearly @xmath17 symmetric in our models .    notice also that @xmath76 explicitly shows the usual @xmath81 variation with distance .",
    "therefore , we will write @xmath82 in our explicit analysis we will use @xmath83 and @xmath84  km , whereas the physical neutrino sphere is approximately at @xmath85  km .",
    "either @xmath76 or @xmath6 can be used as a measure of distance from the sn core .",
    "we assume axially symmetric neutrino emission , implying @xmath86 , but not necessarily an axially symmetric solution . in the lesa context ,",
    "the local neutrino radiation field at some distance @xmath6 and some specific direction is not axially symmetric .",
    "however , if we assume lesa to represent an exact dipole , the system shows global axial symmetry relative to the dipole direction .",
    "our schematic neutrino distributions always refer to the direction of minimal or maximal lepton - number emission , i.e. , to the positive or negative lesa dipole directions . in these extreme lepton - asymmetry directions",
    "the fluxes can be assumed to be locally axially symmetric and in this sense axial symmetry pertains to the emitted fluxes .",
    "we do not think that our overall conclusions are strongly affected by this simplification .    as derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the axially symmetric case one finds the eigenvalue equations @xmath87 where @xmath88 these eigenvalue equations are to be solved to find the eigenfrequencies @xmath89 and the range of parameters where these have an imaginary part , signifying instabilities with regard to self - induced flavor conversion .",
    "notice that the first block in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stabilityconidtion ] ) provides solutions for the axially symmetric case , the so - called bimodal instability ( for inverted mass ordering ) and the multi - zenith - angle ( mza ) instability ( for normal mass ordering ) .",
    "the second block provides the instability where axial symmetry is spontaneously broken , the multi - azimuth - angle ( maa ) instability which appears only for normal mass ordering .",
    "our equations are written for inverted neutrino mass ordering ( io ) , whereas normal ordering ( no ) corresponds to a negative @xmath90 .",
    "however , we prefer to keep @xmath46 a positive parameter so that negative @xmath91 continues to denote antineutrinos .",
    "we can account for the mass ordering by introducing a parameter @xmath92 in front of the vacuum oscillation term @xmath93 in the hamiltonian matrix eq .",

    "this parameter carries through and finally appears in the first line of eq .",

    "we can then , for no , multiply this equation with @xmath94 , restoring the original @xmath45 term , changing the sign of @xmath76 and @xmath95 , and the l.h.s .  of the equation .",
    "for flavor oscillations , it is irrelevant if neutrinos oscillate `` clock - wise '' or `` counter - clockwise '' in flavor space , i.e. , the sign change on the l.h.s .",
    "is not important to find the eigenvalues .",
    "in other words , normal mass ordering is covered by @xmath96 therefore , we should solve the eigenvalue equation for @xmath97 .",
    "the first quadrant , where both parameters are positive , corresponds to io , the third quadrant , where both parameters are negative , to no .",
    "we are mainly concerned with the role of the asymmetry parameter @xmath58 .",
    "of course , there are many ways one can modify the spectrum @xmath98 to achieve a different asymmetry @xmath58 . however , as a simple case we could imagine to switch the role of @xmath0 and @xmath4 , leaving all else unchanged .",
    "this modification corresponds to @xmath99 which implies @xmath100 . in other words ,",
    "we consider a new spectrum @xmath101 . following the propagation of signs in the equations",

    "more precisely , if instead of switching the sign of @xmath58 we switch the sign of @xmath95 , the eigenvalue will also change sign , i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "whenever @xmath89 has an imaginary part , there exists also the complex conjugate solution , i.e. , an exponentially growing and an exponentially damped solution .",
    "therefore , it is irrelevant if we find @xmath89 or @xmath104 because the growth rate is the same in both cases .",

    "it is enough to find the region in the @xmath76-@xmath95 parameter space where the system is unstable , a region which we call the `` footprint of the instability . ''",

    "[ fig : stab - no ] ]    in agreement with the previous literature we find that the most `` dangerous '' region with regard to a possible instability is at the shock wave where the density drops by a large factor , corresponding to a much reduced multi - angle matter effect .",
    "coincidentally , in our shown example of a sn density profile , it never intersects the instability region , but of course small changes in chosen parameters or shifts in the density profile will lead to an unstable region just outside of the shock wave . for a similar result see , for example , fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also confirm previous findings that the maa instability region tends to be nearer to the sn density profile .",
    "of course , which of the two instabilities applies depends on the neutrino mass ordering chosen by nature . in the maa case ,",
    "reducing @xmath58 has the effect of shifting the unstable region away from the sn density profile . in the bimodal case ,",
    "the effect is not monotonic , but typically the @xmath141 case tends to be `` most dangerous '' in the shock - wave region and comparable to the large-@xmath58 case of the maa case .",
    "motivated by the lesa effect , we have studied a simplified example of the impact of an unusually small lepton - number flux on the interplay between self - induced neutrino flavor conversion and its multi - angle matter suppression .",
    "the instability regions are strongly enlarged into regions of small matter density and large neutrino density as perhaps expected .",
    "however , the stability plots in figs .  [ fig : stab - io ] and [ fig : stab - no ] show that for the most part this is a region which does not correspond to a realistic sn density profile . lowering the lepton - number flux by itself",
    "does not have the effect of leading to self - induced flavor conversion in regions below the shock front .",
    "the main point of our study was to explore the direction of the effect of lowering the lepton - number flux . according to our simplified models even strong modifications of the asymmetry parameter",
    "do not have a dramatic impact on the stability question along realistic sn density profiles . for io , where the bimodal instability applies",
    ", a small @xmath58 value can have the effect of creating an unstable region beyond the shock - wave radius .",
    "for no , where the maa instability applies , the largest @xmath58 values provide the `` most dangerous '' instability regions .",
    "overall it is primarily the multi - angle matter effect which controls the instability region for densities relevant along the sn profile . for practical sn simulations with regard to the explosion mechanism",
    ", it appears that unusually small @xmath58 values do not require a reconsideration of neutrino flavor evolution for distances below the shock front .",
    "of course , flavor conversion will be important beyond of the shock front , certainly at large distances by the msw effect , and perhaps in some cases directly outside of the shock front by self - induced flavor conversion .",
    "such effects would be important for the interpretation of the neutrino signal from the next nearby sn , but would not directly affect the explosion dynamics .",
    "our stability analysis was somewhat schematic with the purpose of exploring the general direction of what an unusually small lepton - number flux caused by the lesa effect would do . in principle , of course , in any given sn simulation one could perform an _ a posteriori _ stability analysis , based on the numerical neutrino radiation field and density profile , to verify that it was justified to ignore flavor conversion . in 3d simulations",
    ", the local neutrino radiation field will not be axially symmetric , not even in the lesa dipole directions .",
    "therefore , the stability analysis has to be based on neutrino fluxes with a non - trivial azimuth - angle distribution .",
    "this is not conceptually difficult , but such cases have not yet been explored in practice and await systematic study . in principle , one could eventually develop a numerical tool that could flag possible flavor instabilities as the numerical simulation progresses .",
    "of course , should cases be found where flavor conversion below the shock front occurs after all , a completely new challenge has to be faced in sn modeling .",
    "we stress , however , that not finding flavor - conversion instabilities in such an approach does not necessarily prove that none exist .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we have ignored a number of new issues that have emerged in the recent literature on neutrino - neutrino refractive effects .",
    "these topics should be sorted out before worrying further about self - induced flavor conversion in practical sn simulations . in particular , the multi - angle matter effect which provides the stabilizing ingredient in the present context relies on the assumption that the neutrino radiation field and its flavor properties vary only along the radial direction .",
    "this is an imposed symmetry assumption which can hide unstable solutions that might exist otherwise .",
    "likewise , the assumption of a purely stationary solution , allowing us to treat the problem in the form of an ordinary ( rather than partial ) differential equation has never been strictly justified .",
    "the core - collapse sn explosion mechanism is one of the few physical phenomena where neutrinos play a dominant dynamical role and where the flavor dependence of the fluxes matters . yet",
    "flavor conversion , in spite of large mixing angles , does not seem to figure at all for sn dynamics due to matter suppression of flavor oscillations , i.e. , because in dense matter , propagation and interaction eigenstates are almost the same .",
    "however , a final verdict on the role of active - active flavor conversion for sn dynamics requires more theoretical work to fully appreciate the role of possible flavor instabilities in the interacting neutrino field .",

    "<S> during the accretion phase of a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) , the deleptonization flux has recently been found to develop a global dipole pattern ( lesa  lepton emission self - sustained asymmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 number flux @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath2 in one direction , whereas they are approximately equal , or even @xmath3 , in the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> we use a linearized stability analysis in a simplified sn model to study the impact of the @xmath0@xmath4 flux asymmetry on self - induced neutrino flavor conversion . </S>",
    "<S> while a small lepton - number flux facilitates self - induced flavor conversion , `` multi - angle matter suppression '' is more effective . </S>",
    "<S> overall we find that for large matter densities which are relevant below the shock wave , self - induced flavor conversion remains suppressed in the lesa context and thus irrelevant for neutrino - driven explosion dynamics . </S>"
