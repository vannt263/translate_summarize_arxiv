    "<S> we calculate the sea quark distribution of the nucleon in a meson cloud model . </S>",
    "<S> the novel feature of our calculation is the implementation of a special @xmath0 form factor recently obtained by holzwarth and machleidt . </S>",
    "<S> this form factor is hard for small and soft for large momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this feature leads to a substantial improvement .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm pacs : 13.75.gx , 12.39.dc , 13.60.hb , 14.20.dh    0.5 cm    much effort has been invested over the years to calculate the contribution of mesons to the sea quark distributions in the nucleon at a scale of a few @xmath1 @xcite . in this contribution </S>",
    "<S> we do not want to comment on any of the existing models nor on their relative merits . </S>",
    "<S> we just want to demonstrate that the specific @xmath0 form factor , obtained recently by holzwarth and machleidt @xcite for the skyrme model , leads in a straightforward , lowest - order treatment of the problem to surprisingly good results . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that the standard treatment , namely the convolution of the internal meson quark distribution with the momentum distribution of the mesons , most notably the pion , has not necessarily to give the correct result as the pion is off - shell and the structure function of the off - shell pions should in principle be different from that of on - shell ones . </S>",
    "<S> we shall keep all these caveats in mind .    </S>",
    "<S> the strength of meson cloud models in general for the description of sea quark distributions was demonstrated again lately by their relative ease in describing the observed asymmetry between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the proton @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the pions play a dominant role . </S>",
    "<S> one crucial ingredient in the discussion is the choice of the form factor for the pion - nucleon coupling . in the past </S>",
    "<S> more or less involved parameterizations in monopole , dipole , or exponential form were used : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pion mass , @xmath6 is the negative four - momentum squared of the pion , and the @xmath7 s are cutoff parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> a general problem of this type of form factors is , that if , e.g. ,  the pionic contributions to the flavor symmetry breaking in the nucleon sea are fitted the resulting cutoffs are substantially smaller than those needed in nuclear physics , e.g. ,  for the bonn potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a careful discussion of this problem can be found in @xcite . in that paper koepf , frankfurt , and </S>",
    "<S> strikman obtained @xmath8 from a fit of the pionic and kaonic contributions to @xmath9 with the same form factor and they obtained @xmath10 , when they allow three different cutoffs for the @xmath0 , @xmath11 , and kaon contributions . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to quite soft monopole cutoffs of 660 mev and 780 mev  according to the relation @xmath12 given by kumano @xcite  in comparison to 1.3 gev often used for the bonn potential . on the other hand , a monopole cutoff of 1.3 gev </S>",
    "<S> would be too hard and lead to a large overestimation of the sea .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is natural to search for alternative form factors . </S>",
    "<S> as already shown in @xcite the dominant contribution to the pionic process comes from the region where @xmath13 is above @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> smaller @xmath13 values are not very important . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the large cutoff parameters in nuclear physics are necessary to have a strong enough long - range part of the nuclear force , but they can lead to an insufficient suppression of high - t contributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a form factor starting at low t with a small slope and having a sudden and sufficiently rapid decrease at @xmath15 could give us good results in both nuclear and deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore very interesting to note that a first principle calculation of the @xmath0 form factor within the skyrme model @xcite results in exactly such a type of form factor . </S>",
    "<S> holzwarth and machleidt use the simple skyrme lagrangian @xmath16}^2 d^3 x\\ ] ] with second- and fourth - order terms , where @xmath17 is the chiral field , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the pion decay constant . </S>",
    "<S> the relative strength of the fourth - order term is fixed by the parameter @xmath20 . in fig .  1 we show the resulting skyrme form factor for several values of @xmath20 compared with some exponential and monopole curves .    </S>",
    "<S> -7pt _ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . the skyrme form factor for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( solid lines from top to bottom ) and the exponential form factor for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 mev ( dashed lines from top to bottom ) _    </S>",
    "<S> this form factor is tested in @xcite for the @xmath27-system and gives reasonable results for the phase shifts of neutron - proton scattering for @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we show the curves also for @xmath28 and @xmath29 to demonstrate that the transition between the hard and the soft part of the form factor tends to get sharper when @xmath20 gets smaller . </S>",
    "<S> note that usually values between 3.5 and 4.5 are used to describe baryonic observables @xcite . in the following we apply these skyrme form factors to the meson cloud picture of the nucleon .    </S>",

    "<S> process corrections to the scattering tensor of the nucleon arise which can be translated into corrections @xmath36 to the quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by the well known convolution formula @xcite @xmath37 for the antiquarks @xmath38 of a given flavor in the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 is the antiquark distribution of the same flavor in the meson @xmath31 and the sum runs over all meson - baryon channels taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 is the momentum fraction carried by the meson in the infinite momentum frame and @xmath41 the momentum distribution of the meson in the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> for pseudoscalar mesons and spin-@xmath42 fermions as the final baryon @xmath30 one has @xcite @xmath43 and analogously for spin-@xmath44 fermions @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the masses of the initial state nucleon , the final state baryon , and the meson respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the first two plots show in addition results for an exponential form factor with cutoff @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath25 and @xmath26  mev respectively ( dashed lines from top to bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crosses indicate the cteq3 m fit . </S>",
    "<S> _    we calculated the contributions of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 process to @xmath58 and @xmath59 using always the skyrme form factor and the pionic parton distributions from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with the the cteq3 m parton distribution functions @xcite for @xmath60 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the first quantity is an especially clear signal for meson contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we have no information about the kaon - nucleon form factor from the skyrme model , so we neglect processes containing kaons .    in figs . 3 and 4 </S>",
    "<S> we show our results for @xmath62 and @xmath63 and for @xmath64 and @xmath65  with @xmath66 measuring the photon virtuality and hence the resolution of the dis process . </S>",
    "<S> we are also varying the skyrme parameter @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison there are also the curves following from an exponential form factor with several cutoffs .    </S>",
    "<S> -7pt _ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . @xmath67 for several values of @xmath20 ( solid line ) and @xmath53 and @xmath54 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the first two plots show in addition results for an exponential form factor with cutoff @xmath68 , @xmath57 and @xmath69 mev ( dashed , dashed - dotted , and dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crosses indicate the cteq3 m data . </S>",
    "<S> _    note also that we act partly at rather high - energy ranges , where the applicability of the skyrme model might be problematic . </S>",
    "<S> still one can see that @xmath21 reproduces well the cteq - data for @xmath62 . for @xmath63 @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> leads to an overestimation of the sea and lower values of @xmath20 down to 3.0 are required to fit the data . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a very strong fourth - order term in the skyrme lagrangian and is hardly acceptable with view to several low - energy parameters which have to be fitted simultaneously with the skyrme model .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , one can state that the situation is substantially better than in the exponential case . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential form factor has the following problems : when the cutoffs for the @xmath0 and the @xmath11 vertex are taken to be the same , @xmath62 can not be fitted . </S>",
    "<S> starting at a value of @xmath70 , the contribution increases with increasing cutoff , reaching a maximum at approximately @xmath71 from where on the contribution decreases again for @xmath72 without having reached the cteq - fit . </S>",
    "<S> this comes from the different behavior of the @xmath0- and the @xmath11- sector . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , if one uses cutoffs suggested by low - energy nuclear physics , the overestimation of @xmath63 is far worse than for the skyrme model .    </S>",

    "<S> the pion distribution in the nucleon through the @xmath0 process for a skyrme form factor with @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> _    one should also consider the effects of higher order fock space states . for reasonable values of @xmath73 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. @xmath74 , the convolution integral ( 6 ) mainly takes into account the tail of the meson distribution @xmath75 which peaks typically around @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.5 shows an example for the meson distribution for @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> multimeson states would obviously blow up the meson distribution for @xmath77 and reduce it for larger @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this would lead to a decrease of @xmath78 for @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath80 we expect this effect to cancel more or less between the @xmath0 and the @xmath11 contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a form factor which is hard for small @xmath13 and soft for large @xmath13 is advantageous for meson - cloud models . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the skyrme model form factor shows this property naturally . </S>",
    "<S> however , to obtain a good fit to the sea parton distribution , one has to choose the skyrme model parameter @xmath20 somewhat smaller than permitted by fits to low - energy data . </S>",
    "<S> we have the hope that higher - order meson states tend to reduce the overestimation for @xmath63 without destroying the acceptable results for @xmath62 ( for @xmath21 ) . </S>"
