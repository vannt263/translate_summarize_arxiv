    "the topic of three - body forces ( 3bfs ) is as old as nuclear physics @xcite and , based on meson exchanges , various processes have been proposed in the past ( for a review see @xcite ) . among them ,",
    "the fujita - miyazawa force @xcite with an intermediate @xmath0 generated by the exchange of two pions is most obvious and is implemented in all modern 3bf models . however the nature of these 3bfs is still not completely understood . in recent years",
    "there has been new progress in understanding the form of nuclear forces , because of the application of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt ) @xcite-@xcite . from this",
    "developments one can expect a more systematic understanding of the form of two - body ( 2b ) and 3b forces",
    ". however , @xmath1pt implies _ a priori _ unknown constants , the low - energy constants , which have to be determined from experimental data .",
    "the bound states of few - nucleons seem to be an ideal laboratory to determine 3bf parameters , as the binding energies are sensitive to the 3b interaction and they are expected to be governed by the low - energy regime of nuclear physics @xcite . therefore , the understanding of nuclear few - body bound states is an important contribution to the understanding of the 3bf . to this aim and for their numerical investigations one requires reliable methods leading to the solutions of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .    in the past several solution methods",
    "have been developed and applied to the four - body bound state problem by using realistic nuclear potentials , the crcgv @xcite , the sv @xcite , the hh @xcite , the gfmc @xcite , the ncsm @xcite , eihh @xcite and the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these calculational schemes are mostly based on a partial wave ( pw ) decomposition .",
    "stochastic and monte carlo methods , however , are performed directly using position vectors in configuration space .",
    "one of the most viable approaches appears to be the fy method .",
    "the calculations based on fy are performed after a pw expansion with phenomenological potentials in configuration space @xcite , and in momentum space @xcite-@xcite and recently with chiral potentials in momentum space @xcite-@xcite .    the fy scheme based on a pw decomposition , which includes spin and isospin degrees of freedom , after truncation leads to two coupled sets of a finite number of coupled equations in three variables for the amplitudes . in pw decomposition",
    "the number of channels that must be included grows very rapidly in this case , and a further complication is arisen where there are now six spatial dimensions rather than the three required for three - body calculations .",
    "so in a pw decomposition one needs a tremendous number of partial waves to find converged results . in view of this very large number of interfering terms",
    "it appears natural to give up such an expansion and work directly with vector variables .    on this basis",
    "recently we have extended the three - dimensional ( 3d ) approach , which greatly simplifies the two- and three - body scattering and bound state calculations without using pw decomposition @xcite-@xcite , to the four - body bound state @xcite .",
    "we have formulated the yakubovsky equations with only 2bfs as function of vector jacobi momenta , specifically the magnitudes of the momenta and the angles between them .",
    "we have obtained two coupled three - dimensional integral equations in six variables for the amplitudes which greatly simplifies the calculations without using pw decomposition .",
    "the obtained three - dimensional integral equations have been solved successfully for simple nn force models . in this paper",
    "we follow the same approach and consider the 3bfs in four - body bound state problem . as a simplification we neglect spin and isospin degrees of freedom and",
    "study the four - boson bound state problem .",
    "so the purpose of this work is to demonstrate that one can solve the yakubovsky equations for four - body bound state without using pw decomposition and in the first attempt we have done it by using very simple 2b and 3b model interactions .",
    "in our formulation we work directly with vector variables in the yakubovsky scheme in momentum space . here",
    "the dependence on momentum vectors shows that our 3d representation in comparison to traditional pw representation avoids the very involved angular momentum algebra occurring for the permutations and especially for the 3bfs and the full solution can be reached exactly and simply whereas the pw representation of the amplitudes leads to rather complicated expressions @xcite .",
    "we believe that this work is another step forward in the development of 3d approach for studying the few - body systems and it is the first attempt towards the solution of the 4n bound state problem with the inclusion of 3nfs without performing the pw decomposition .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : yes ] we briefly represent the coupled yakubovsky equations for four - body bound state with two- and three - body interactions . in section",

    "finally we summarize in section [ section : summary ] and provide an outlook .",
