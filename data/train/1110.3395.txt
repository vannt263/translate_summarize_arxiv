    "more recently , yau and liu @xcite defines a quasi - local mass , generalizing the brown - york quasi - local mass , and prove its positivity using the jang equation .",
    "the problem can be stated as follow : let @xmath42 be an initial data set for the einstein equation and consider the four dimensional manifold @xmath164 equipped with the _ riemannian _ metric @xmath165 .",
    "the problem is to find a smooth function @xmath166 such that the hypersurface @xmath167 of @xmath164 obtained by taking the graph of @xmath168 over @xmath30 satisfies the equation @xmath169 where @xmath170 denotes the mean curvature of @xmath171 in @xmath172 and @xmath173 is the trace on @xmath171 with respect to the induced metric .",
    "this geometric problem is equivalent to solve the non - linear second order elliptic equation @xmath174 where @xmath49 ( resp .",

    "assuming now that the initial data set @xmath42 comes from a spacetime satisfying the dominant energy condition , schoen and yau proved that the following relation holds on @xmath171 : @xmath183 where @xmath184 @xmath185 is the tangent part of the vector field dual to @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 denotes the unit normal vector field to @xmath171 in @xmath164 .",

    "it is important to note here that in theorem [ spacetime ] , we assume that there is no apparent horizon in the interior of @xmath9 to ensure the existence of a global solution to the jang equation .",
    "indeed , if @xmath191 is an apparent horizon then a solution of ( [ jang ] ) blows up at @xmath191 and the resulting graph @xmath171 is asymptotic to a cylinder @xmath192 . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "we could try to apply a trick of schoen - yau @xcite to compactify these ends , however it does not work in our situation .",
    "indeed , the first step in schoen - yau s method is to deform the metric @xmath72 on the parts which are asymptotic to the cylinders so that these components _ coincide _ with the cylinders .",
    "however this transformation destroys equation ( [ schoenyau ] ) and this adds a real difficulty for our purpose .",
    "nevertheless , it seems reasonable to think that our result is true in this more general context .      from the work @xcite and",
    "since we assumed that @xmath9 has no apparent horizon in its interior , there exists a solution @xmath168 to the jang equation ( [ jang ] ) defined and smooth on @xmath9 with dirichlet boundary condition @xmath193 this boundary condition ensures that the metric @xmath72 coincides with the metric @xmath28 on the boundary @xmath8 so that the dirac operators @xmath104 acting on @xmath97 and @xmath194 on @xmath195 also coincide .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath196 where the last equality comes from the fact that @xmath8 is a @xmath6-dimensional manifold and then @xmath197 .",
    "moreover , from a calculation in @xcite we have : @xmath198 where @xmath199 and thus @xmath200 holds since @xmath201 . here @xmath202 denotes the unit outward normal vector field of @xmath8 in @xmath203 . on the other hand , the resulting riemannian manifold @xmath203 satisfies condition ( [ scalarcond ] ) because of ( [ schoenyau ] ) and where the vector field @xmath204 is defined by ( [ defx ] ) .",
    "the assumptions of theorem [ newextrin ] are fulfilled and then @xmath205 combining ( [ boundblack ] ) and ( [ new1 ] ) give the estimate .",
    "now assume that equality is achieved .",
    "once again we apply theorem [ newextrin ] and then @xmath203 has a parallel spinor field @xmath159 .",
    "in particular , @xmath203 is ricci flat and since it is a @xmath109-dimensional domain , it is flat . moreover , if we have equality in ( [ schoenyau ] ) , then the second fundamental form of @xmath203 in @xmath164 is @xmath67 .",
    "so we can choose a coordinates system @xmath206 in a neighborhood @xmath207 of a point @xmath208 such that @xmath209 .",
    "in this chart , we have : @xmath210        [ modlocmass ] this result leads to the definition of a new quasi - local mass for @xmath6-spheres with positive gauss curvature similar to liu - yau @xcite .",
