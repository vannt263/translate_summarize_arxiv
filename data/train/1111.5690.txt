    "born for a particular need in a cohort study  @xcite , is now a framework of knowledge discovery in databases on its own , used in several application domains , e.g.  @xcite . intended to an educational and scientific usage",
    ", the system is articulated into several modules for preparing and mining binary data , and filtering and interpreting the extracted units .",
    "thus , from binary data ( possibly obtained from a discretization procedure ) , allows one to extract itemsets ( frequent , closed , generators , etc . ) and then to generate association rules ( non - redundant , informative , etc . ) .",
    "building concept lattices is also possible .",
    "the system includes many classical algorithms of the literature , but also others that are specific to  @xcite .",
    "the software is freely available at http://coron.loria.fr . mainly written in java ,",
    "is compatible with the unix , mac and windows operating systems and is of command - line usage .",
    "the methodology was initially designed for mining biological cohorts , but it is generalizable to any kind of database .",
    "it is important to notice that the whole process is guided by an expert , who is a specialist of the domain related to the database .",
    "his role may be crucial , especially for selecting the data and for interpreting the extracted units , in order to fully turn them into knowledge units . in our case ,",
    "the extracted knowledge units are mainly association rules . at the present time , finding association rules is one of the most important tasks in data mining .",
    "association rules allow one to reveal `` hidden '' relationships in a dataset .",
    "finding association rules requires first the extraction of frequent itemsets .",
    "the methodology consists of the following steps : definition of the study framework ; iterative step : data preparation and cleaning , pre - processing step , processing step , post - processing step ; validation of the results and generation of new research hypotheses ; feedback on the experiment .",
    "the life - cycle of the methodology is shown in figure [ loop ] .",
    "coron is designed to satisfy the present methodology and offers all the tools that are necessary for its application in a single platform .",
    "[ [ pre - processing . ] ] pre - processing .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    these modules propose several tools for manipulating and formatting large data .",
    "the data are described by binary tables in a simple text - file format : some individuals in lines possess or not some properties in column .",
    "the main possible operations are : ( i ) discretization of numerical data , ( ii ) conversion of different file formats , ( iii ) creation of the complement of the binary table , and ( iv ) other projection operations such as transposition of the table .",
    "[ [ data - mining . ] ] data mining .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    extracting itemsets and association rules is a very popular task in data mining .",
    "concept lattices are mathematical structures supported by a rich and well established formalism , namely , formal concept analysis  @xcite .",
    "a concept lattice is represented by a diagram giving nice visualization of classes of objects of a domain .",
    "thus , the data mining modules of the system offer the following possibilities :    * itemset extraction : frequent , closed , rare , generators , etc .",
    "this task is performed by a large collection of algorithms based on different search strategies ( depth - first , level - wise , etc . ) . * association rules generation : frequent , rare , closed , informative , minimal non - redundant , duquenne - guigues basis , etc .",
    "these rules are given with a set of measures such as support , confidence , lift , conviction , etc . * concept lattice construction .",
    "[ [ post - processing . ] ] post - processing .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    extracted units from the data mining step may be very numerous , and hide some units of higher interest .",
    "thus , proposes some filtering operations that should be done in interaction with a domain expert .",
    "the analyst may filter rules w.r.t .",
    "the length of its components , and/or the presence of a given property .",
    "he may also retain the @xmath0 best extracted units w.r.t .",
    "a measure of interest .",
    "it is also possible to color some properties of a list of association rules .",
    "[ [ toolbox . ] ] toolbox .",
    "+ + + + + + + +    finally , auxiliary modules allow one to visualize equivalence classes of itemsets , randomly generate binary data , etc .",
    "has been used for the following tasks : extraction of knowledge of adaptation in case - based reasoning  @xcite , gene expression data analysis  @xcite , information retrieval  @xcite , recommendations for internet advertisement  @xcite , biological data integration  @xcite , and finally , cohort studies  @xcite .",
    "currently , we are studying how to integrate in platforms using graphical data - flows , such as knime @xcite , whose popularity is increasing ( http://www.knime.org ) .",
    "this would allow to interact with many other useful tools , most importantly avoiding a command - line usage . also , other tools will be integrated in to consider complex data , mainly numerical , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have recently set up a forum to gather questions , comments and suggestions from users ( http://coron.loria.fr/forum/ ) .    in this paper , we have given a brief overview of the system .",
