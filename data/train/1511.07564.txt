    "high speed railway ( hsr ) system is developed rapidly all over the world . especially in china ,",
    "the length of railway has exceeded 11028 km .",
    "since it is a fast , safe and green transportation system , hsr is playing a very important role in people s daily life , and more and more people are spending more and more time on high speed trains ( hst ) for traveling . in order for passengers to enjoy the information services including entertainment and online video , the demand of wireless communications in trains grows day by day .",
    "but due to the high mobility of trains , this communication demand is challengeable to be satisfied .    to provide reliable communications for hsr systems , several problems have to be solved @xcite .",
    "firstly , the handover between the cells is very frequently because of high moving speed . for instances ,",
    "the cell radius is generally about 2@xmath03 km in typical gsm - r networks @xcite .",
    "if the speed of train is over 500 km/h @xcite , the handover period is about 14@xmath021s , which is quiet short compared with the general information services .",
    "secondly , the doppler shift makes the synchronization quite difficult .",
    "for example , the maximum doppler shift of hst is about 945hz at the speed of 486 km/h with the carrier frequency of 2.1 ghz .",
    "thirdly , the hst carriage is enclosed by metal materials which shields the signals transmitted in and out the carriage , termed as penetration loss . in practical hsr systems ,",
    "the penetration loss even exceeds 25db . to release these problems above , a great deal of work so far",
    "has been done , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , it proposed a seamless dual - link handover scheme to minimize the communication interruption during handover to handle the first problem . in @xcite ,",
    "a cooperative antenna system was built and an algorithm of doppler frequency offset ( dfo ) estimation was proposed . in @xcite , a two - hop architecture was proposed to overcome the dramatic penetration loss of radio signals transmitted in and out the hst carriages , where all users in the train are considered as a big virtual user , their transmitted signals are first aggregated at a mobile relay deployed on the carriage and then delivered over the train - ground link between the mobile relay and the ground bss . besides , the deployment of bs was investigated in @xcite and @xcite .    in the past decades",
    ", multi - antenna technology has been widely investigated , see e.g. , @xcite,@xcite , which is able to provide diversity and multiplexing gain to improve the information transmission throughput and reliability of wireless communications . deploying multiple antennas requires that the antenna spacing must be larger than 1/2 wavelength so that the transmit / receive signals for the multiple antennas have relatively low correlation .",
    "since a hst is usually with the length about 200 m , it provides sufficient space for deploying multiple antennas in linear array .",
    "recently , some works started to study the multi - antenna system deployed on the train @xcite .",
    "the deployment of multiple antennas may impact the system performance of hsr communications greatly . as reported in hsr system , the large scale fading of the channels is the dominant factor affecting the system communication performance .",
    "when the train is moving , the distances between the multiple antennas deployed on the train and the serving bs located on the railway side change very fast .",
    "if the antennas are equipped very closely to each other , they may have very similar distances to the serving bs . while if the antennas are positioned relatively far from each other , they may have very different distances to the serving bs .",
    "thus , different antenna deployment strategies may result in very different performance . to better understand the impacts of the deployment of multiple antennas on hst , several fundamental questions are required to be answered .    *",
    "how does the deployment of multiple antennas impacts the instantaneous channel capacity and the total service amount of hst ? * besides the instantaneous channel capacity and service amount , how to effectively evaluate the system information transmission performance over the time domain ? * what is the efficient multiple - antenna deployment strategy ?    to answer these questions , we consider two multiple - antenna strategies i.e. , the equidistant strategy and the fixed - interval strategy . besides the instantaneous channel capacity and service amount ,",
    "outage time ratio is also introduced as a metric to evaluate the system performance . some theoretical analysis and numerical results",
    "show that , for two - antenna case , by increasing the distance of neighboring antennas in a reasonable region , the system performance can be enhanced and that the two strategies have much difference performance behavior in terms of instantaneous channel capacity and the fixed - interval strategy may achieve better performance than the equidistant one in terms of service amount and outage time ratio if the antenna number is relatively large .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , it introduces the system model and two multiple - antenna deployment strategies . in section iii",
    ", we define the performance metrics and analyze the two multiple antennas deploying strategies .",
    "some simulation results are provided in section iv .",
    "finally , some conclusions are given in section v.",
    "consider a hsr communication scenario as shown in figure [ systemmodel ] , where a hst runs at a constant speed @xmath1 along a straight track and it desires to communicate with the serving base station ( bs ) via a two - hop link .",
    "the two - hop link means that there is a relay equipped on the train , which is used to help the information delivering between the serving bs and the users in the train .",
    "specifically , in the downlink scenario , the roadside bs first transmits information to the relay and then the relay helps to forward the information to the passengers within the carriages . in the uplink scenario ,",
    "the passengers in the carriages first connect with the relay and then transmit information to the bs with the help of the relay .",
    "since the service amount of downlink is much larger than that of uplink , in this paper , we only focus on the downlink transmission over the two - hop link .",
    "suppose the bss are positioned with equal distance interval @xmath2 on the parallel line of the railway . to enhance the system transmission performance , @xmath3 omnidirectional antennas .",
    "for example , in lte system , the carrier frequency is about 2000mhz and the wavelength is about 0.15 m .",
    "so , the distance between two antennas must be larger than @xmath4 m and the maximal @xmath3 is about 2666 . ]",
    "are equipped on the train for the relay , referred to as train relay station ( trs ) .",
    "therefore , in the downlink transmission , trs can receive multiple copies of the signals associated with same information transmitted from the serving bs .",
    "then , the tsr can decode the information from the bs by using maximal - ratio - combining ( mrc ) . for clarity , we use @xmath5 and @xmath6 to represent the bs and the @xmath7th antenna respectively , where @xmath8 .        in hsr communications ,",
    "the effect of large - scale fading is more important comparing with that of small - scale fading , since in most scenarios , hst is moving in open fields such as the viaduct bridge , which is lack of scatters . in this case , the distance between the hst and the bs is the dominant factor affecting the received signals .",
    "the path loss can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the antenna gain , @xmath11 is the wavelength of the carrier and @xmath12 is the distance between @xmath7th ( @xmath13 ) antenna of hst and the bs .",
    "since the length of a train is often more than 200 meters , it provides a large space to deploy multiple antennas in linear mode and to obtain special diversity . as mentioned previously",
    ", large - scale fading is the dominant factor for the hsr communications , which indicates that if one places the antennas at different position , it may have big different large - scale effects , resulting in much difference in system performance .",
    "motivated by this , we present two antenna deployment strategies as follows .      in equidistant deployment strategy , the antennas are positioned evenly on the train with equal distance between any two neighboring antennas , where the equal distance should be large than the half wavelength and set to be @xmath14 m , where @xmath15 is the length of the hst , @xmath3 is the antenna number deployed on the train .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath16 m , if two antennas are deployed according to the equidistant strategy , the distance between the two antennas is 200 m , while for three antennas case , the distance between two neighboring antennas is 100 m .",
    "assuming the cross point of the railway and its vertical line through the serving bs is the original point of the time axis and train moves towards the positive direction of the time axis .",
    "the distance between @xmath7th antenna and the serving bs at time @xmath17 is    @xmath18    where @xmath1 is the velocity of hst , @xmath19 is the vertical distance between the track and the serving bs and @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath2 is the serving coverage parameter along the high speed train track .",
    "additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel is assumed , so the @xmath7th antenna s received signal to noise ratio ( snr ) from the bs can be expressed by @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the instantaneous achievable information rate per hz of the hst with equidistant strategy at time @xmath17 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bandwidth of carrier , @xmath24 is the path loss from @xmath7th antenna to the serving bs , @xmath25 is the power density of awgn and @xmath26 is the transmission power of the serving bs .      in the fixed - interval deployment strategy ,",
    "the antennas are divided into two sets with equal amount and the antennas in the first set is placed one by one from the head to the tail of the train while the antennas in the second set is placed one by one from the tail to the head of the train .",
    "the distance between any two neighboring antennas in the same set is with a fixed value @xmath27 , where @xmath27 is larger than the half wavelength and less than @xmath14 m.    assuming that the @xmath3 is even , the distance between @xmath7th antenna and the serving bs can be given by @xmath28    the corresponding received @xmath29 and the instantaneous achievable information rate of hst with fixed - interval strategy at time t is    @xmath30",
    "to effectively evaluate the performance of different antenna deployments , besides instantaneous achievable information rate , we introduce the concepts of mobile service@xcite and outage time ratio of the hst during the time period @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "service was defined as the integral of the instantaneous channel capacity over the time period @xmath32 $ ] , which is used to describe the information transmission amount of the serving bs during a given time period and can be considered as the upper bounds of transmission@xcite .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is @xmath35 or @xmath36 .      in practical applications ,",
    "when the instantaneous channel capacity is lower than the user s information rate requirement , the communication outage occurs .",
    "thus , for a given rate threshold @xmath37 , we define the total time duration that the the instantaneous channel capacity lower than @xmath37 to the total time period @xmath38 as the outage time ratio , which can be calculated by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 and @xmath44 .          in this subsection",
    ", we shall analyze the performance of the two proposed strategies . as it is difficult to directly calculate service amount and outage time ratio for the two strategies with a relatively large @xmath3",
    ", we analyze them as follows .",
    "we first analyze the case of @xmath45 .",
    "it is noted that if the fixed interval is equal to the train length @xmath15 , i.e. the two antenna are deployed at the head and tail of the train , the fixed - interval strategy is the same with that of the equidistant strategy with distance between two antennas as @xmath15 .",
    "that is , both strategies have the same system performance .",
    "if the fixed interval is less than the train length @xmath15 , and the distance between two antennas is not the same , both of the strategies will have different performance .",
    "for @xmath45 , consider the case that the two antenna are deployed at the head and tail of the train , the mobile service can be calculated as eq.([c_sum ] ) @xcite .",
    "let @xmath46 . because @xmath47 is always @xmath48",
    ", @xmath49 is always larger than @xmath50 .",
    "the relation between @xmath51 for two antennas and @xmath15 can be summarized as follows .    for",
    "given @xmath2 and @xmath1 , @xmath52 for two antennas is decreasing function w.r.t .",
    "@xmath15 if @xmath15 is very large and it has a maximum .",
    "let @xmath53 , @xmath54 since @xmath55 always holds and @xmath56 it can be inferred that @xmath57 when @xmath58 for each @xmath59 $ ] . in this case , the integral function is always negative , which imply that @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath52 for two antennas is decreasing function in @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath52 is a continuous function of @xmath15 and bounded , thus there exists a maximum .    for given",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 , @xmath61 with @xmath45 is a first decrease and then increase function w.r.t . @xmath15 and    @xmath62    where @xmath63 .    for @xmath64 , the differential of @xmath65 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath17 is @xmath66 since the denominator is always @xmath67 , the root of @xmath68 is    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is a repeated root representing the local minimum point and @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent the rate peak point . let @xmath63 .",
    "the solutions of @xmath73 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath17 are as follows .",
    "they are , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it s worth noting that within @xmath82 $ ] , @xmath37 has at most four intersect points with the curve of capacity of the two - antenna system .",
    "particularly , when @xmath83 , there is no intersection point . when @xmath84 , there are four intersection points , i.e. , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . when @xmath89 , there are two intersection points , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and in this case , the outage time ratio is @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 with some simple mathematical manipulations , one can arrive at lemma 2 .",
    "@xmath92    ' '' ''    for @xmath93 , assuming that @xmath3 is an even number , then we have a lemma as follows .    for @xmath93 , when @xmath15 is not very large , the service amount of the fixed - interval strategy is not lower than that of the equidistant strategy and the outage time ratio of the fixed - interval strategy is not higher than that of the equidistant strategy .",
    "all @xmath3 antennas can be divided into @xmath94 groups and each group includes two antennas which are expressed as the @xmath6-th antenna and the @xmath95th antenna , where @xmath96 .",
    "for example , the first antenna and the last one is in group 1 , and the second antenna and the @xmath97-th antenna is in group 2 , as shown in figure [ four_antenna ] . with the grouping method of the antennas , for the group with the same index @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , the distance of between two antennas in equidistant strategy is @xmath100 and that in fixed - interval strategy is @xmath101 because @xmath102 , @xmath103 , we have that the distance between two antennas in each group of the fixed - interval strategy is no less than that in the corresponding group of the equidistant strategy . with lemma 1 and lemma 2 ,",
    "when @xmath15 is not large , for each corresponding group , it can be inferred that the service amount and the @xmath61 in fixed - interval strategy are respectively higher and lower than those in the equal - distant strategy .",
    "therefore , lemma 3 is proved .    when @xmath104 , the deployment result of the fixed - interval strategy is the same with that of the equidistant strategy , where @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the wavelength of carrier .",
    "that is , when @xmath104 , both strategies have the same system performance .",
    "in this section , we provide some simulation results to discuss the system performance of the proposed two antenna deployment strategies in terms of instantaneous capacity , service mount and outage time ratio .",
    "detailed simulation parameters are shown in table [ parameter ] .",
    ".simulation parameter [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ d_l_t ] shows the system performance versus the distance between two neighboring antennas for @xmath45 case , where figure [ d_l_t](a ) and ( b ) plot the service amount and outage time ratio verses antenna distance for equidistant strategy , respectively .",
    "the antenna distance is change from @xmath107 to @xmath108 for the equidistant strategy and the fix interval @xmath27 is set to be 1 m for the fixed interval strategy .",
    "@xmath109 is set as 0.15 bit / s / hz which is the average capacity of single antenna system during the given time period .",
    "it can be observed that with the increment of the antenna distance , the service increases and the outage time ratio decreases . this is because the derivative of function @xmath110 declines as @xmath111 increasing .",
    "particularly , when the two antennas are deployed close to each other , they pass the original point almost at the same time . as a result , @xmath112 and",
    "@xmath113 achieves their maximum values almost at the same time . in this case , @xmath114 contribute relatively little to improve total service amount .",
    "when the two antennas are deployed very far from each other , they achieve their maximum snr at very different time .",
    "thus , the integration of instantaneous channel capacity is improved greatly . moreover , as the two antennas achieve their maximum received snr at different time , thus the outage time ratio is decreased .",
    "figure [ l1000 ] plots an extreme case with two antennas , where the length of the train is sufficiently large , so that the distance of antennas can be increased much larger .",
    "it is observed that the service amount firstly increases and then decrease with the increment of antenna distance , which is consist the theoretical results obtained in lemma 1 .",

    "it is observed that , with the increment of the number of antennas , the instantaneous channel capacity of both two strategies can be increased at any time .",
    "but the capacity gain is relatively large when the train is near the serving bs and relatively small when the train is far way from the serving bs .",
    "besides , the two strategies show very different instantaneous channel capacity behavior with the increment of the number of antennas .",
    "that is , there are two rate peaks in the fixed - interval strategy , but basically only one peak in the equidistant strategy when the number of antennas is 10 , 50 and 100 .",
    "it is also shown that in fixed - interval strategy , the distance between two rate peaks decreases and finally the two rate peaks are merged into one rate peak when the number of antennas is relatively large . moreover , when @xmath115 , the two strategies show very similar performance behavior , since in this case the deployment of two strategies are the same .    ) and ( ii ) equidistant strategy.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to fully compare the instantaneous channel capacity of the two strategies , figure [ a600 ] changes @xmath27 to be 0.15 m , which is similar to the wavelength of the carrier . in this case , 600 antennas are deployed on the hst , which can be considered as a massive antenna case . it can be observed that the fixed - interval strategy contributes a larger capacity gain than the equidistant strategy in most time , but it has lower peak rate than the equidistant one . as it is more expected to experience a more smooth wireless communication rather than very high peak rate , it is preferred to adopt the fixed - interval strategy in such a massive antenna case .    ) and equidistant strategy for @xmath116 case.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    for the ultimate case , where @xmath3 is increased to be @xmath117 , figure [ com_f_e ] plots its service amount w.r.t the numbers of antennas of two strategies when the fix interval @xmath27 is set as 0.075 m which is the half wavelength of the carrier . in such an extreme scenario , @xmath118 .",
    "it can be seen that , the two considered strategies have the overlapped performance at @xmath45 and @xmath119 , which is as expected .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that the service amount of two proposed strategies is firstly increasing and then decreasing versus the number of antennas and the maximum difference comes about at @xmath115 in this scenario .",
    "the reason is that for a relatively large @xmath3 , the average distance of two antennas in equidistant strategy is similar to that of that fixed - interval strategy .",
