    "recently a lot of efforts went into the computation of gravitational corrections to the beta function of the running yang - mills coupling constant .",
    "robinson and wilczek @xcite , in an effective field theory setting , obtained a non - zero correction at the one - loop level .",
    "it has the same negative sign as the familiar term already present in absence of gravity , and so it would render even pure abelian theories asymptotically free .",
    "after pietrykowski @xcite had realized that this result is gauge fixing dependent , toms @xcite reanalyzed the problem using the vilkovisky - dewitt method . in a manifestly gauge invariant as well as",
    "gauge fixing independent formulation of the effective action he finds that the quantum gravity contributions to the running charge vanish .",
    "all of these computations employ the dimensional regularization scheme . in @xcite ,",
    "ebert , plefka and rodigast pointed out that its use might be problematic since it is insensitive to quadratic divergences , and it is precisely such quadratic divergences that are responsible for the non - zero result obtained in @xcite . using a cutoff regularization instead they found that all gravitational quadratic divergences cancel so that there is again no correction to the beta function .",
    "thereafter tang and wu @xcite argued that the use of a cutoff regularization is not permissible here since it does not respect gauge invariance . performing a calculation in a scheme which both retains quadratic divergences and preserves gauge invariance ( `` loop regularization '' ) they obtained a non - zero gravitational correction to the one - loop beta function .",
    "furthermore , toms @xcite demonstrated that , with a cosmological constant included , also dimensional regularization yields a non - vanishing gravitational correction , albeit of a different type .    in the present paper",
    "we shall analyze the running of the gauge coupling constant in the framework of the asymptotic safety approach to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "contrary to the calculations mentioned above it considers metric gravity not merely an effective but rather a fundamental quantum field theory , with the continuum limit taken at a non - trivial renormalization group ( rg ) fixed point @xcite . instead of perturbation theory , the main tool will be the gravitational average action @xcite and a suitably truncated form of the associated functional rg equation ( frge ) .",
    "originally developed for matter field theories @xcite the effective average action turned out an ideal tool for investigating the rg flow of quantum einstein gravity ( qeg)@xcite and exploring its potential physics implications @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first , we develop a general framework for both exact and approximate ( `` truncated '' ) investigations of the yang - mills  gravity system by means of a _ gauge invariant _ running effective action . in particular we shall see that because of the semi - direct product structure of the pertinent gauge group there arises a subtlety as for the appropriate construction of the ghost action .",
    "second , we use the resulting framework in order to find the rg flow in a simple truncation of the space of actions which , however , is general enough to allow for an approximate determination of the beta function of the yang - mills coupling constant in presence of quantized gravity .    the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the general setup of the effective average action for a yang - mills field coupled to gravity , the corresponding frge in particular .",
    "then , in section 3 , we discuss the problem of background covariant ghost actions and explain its solution .",
    "the explicit computation of the running gauge coupling is performed in section 4 , and section 5 contains a summary as well as a brief discussion of various immediate applications of our results .",
    "schematically the dynamics of the yang - mills  gravity system is governed by the path integral @xmath0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the quantum metric and the quantum gauge field , respectively , and @xmath3 denotes the bare action . as usual , both of these fields are supposed to transform tensorially with respect to diffeomorphisms , @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , @xmath2 defines a connection with respect to yang - mills gauge transformations , @xmath5 . denoting the vector field that generates the diffeomorphism by @xmath6 and the parameter of the yang - mills transformation by @xmath7 , we have ( @xmath8 denotes the lie derivative along @xmath6 ) : @xmath9    from now on we will assume the yang - mills gauge group to be @xmath10 , so @xmath11 runs from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the associated structure constants .",
    "we demand @xmath3 to be invariant under both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    employing the background formalism",
    ", the dynamical fields are decomposed according to @xmath15    with fixed , but arbitrary background configurations @xmath16 and @xmath17 and fluctuations @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite . assuming a translational invariant measure",
    ", the fluctuation fields will replace the full quantum fields as the variables of integration in ( [ pi - sketchy ] ) .",
    "there are now two possibilities to realize the gauge transformations @xmath4 and @xmath5 at the level of the background decomposition :    * the _ background gauge transformations _ @xmath20 and @xmath21 are defined such that under diffeomorphisms all the fields transform tensorially , i.e. @xmath22 with respect to yang - mills transformations , the background gauge field transforms as a connection and the fluctuation transforms homogeneously : @xmath23 * on the other hand , we can define _ true gauge transformations _ @xmath24 and @xmath25 by requiring that these shall only affect the fluctuations , not the background fields : @xmath26    the crucial idea is to choose a gauge fixing term @xmath27 that breaks only the true gauge invariance but retains background gauge invariance .",
    "it gives rise to an associated ghost action @xmath28 in the usual way .",
    "introducing ghost fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the diffeomorphisms and @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the yang - mills transformations , respectively , we arrive at the following path integral which depends parametrically on the background fields : @xmath33 - s^{\\rm gf } - s_{\\rm gh}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to set up a functional rg equation , we follow the well - known construction of the effective average action @xcite and add a higher derivative ir cutoff term @xmath34 that is quadratic in the fluctuations : @xmath35}^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}h_{\\rho\\sigma}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\:{\\rm d}^d x\\:\\sqrt{\\bar{g}}\\:a^a_\\mu{{\\cal r}^{\\rm ym}_k [ \\bar{g } , \\bar{a}]}^{a\\mu b\\nu}a^b_\\nu\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sqrt{2 } \\int\\:{\\rm d}^d x\\:\\sqrt{\\bar{g}}\\:\\big(\\bar{\\cal{c } } , \\bar{\\sigma}\\big){{\\cal r}^{\\rm gh}_k [ \\bar{g } , \\bar{a}]}\\bigg(\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c } { \\cal c } \\\\[-0.2 cm ] \\sigma \\end{array}\\!\\ ! \\bigg)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath36 and @xmath37 denoting newton s constant ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , adding appropriate source terms enables us to easily compute expectation values of the quantum fields . with the notation @xmath38",
    "the background decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) now reads @xmath39    the legendre transformation of the now @xmath40-dependent functional @xmath41 with respect to the sources leads to the effective average action then @xcite : @xmath42 \\equiv \\gamma_k[g_{\\mu\\nu } , \\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu } , a^a_\\mu , \\bar{a}^a_\\mu , \\xi^\\mu , \\bar{\\xi}_\\mu , \\upsilon^a , \\bar{\\upsilon}^a]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    its scale dependence is governed by the functional renormalization group equation ( frge ) @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 denotes the hessian of @xmath45 with respect to all fluctuation and ghost expectation values , @xmath46 is some suitably chosen generalized laplacian , and @xmath47 is the `` rg time '' .",
    "since we deal with two gauge invariances , a remark concerning the notation is in order : we write @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the covariant derivatives that are constructed by means of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively ; the covariant derivative containing both of these connections is denoted by @xmath52 . by adding a bar , we denote their analogues evaluated on the background configurations .",
    "since we have to fix two gauge invariances by two gauge conditions , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the diffeomorphisms and the @xmath10 transformations , respectively , the associated faddeev - popov operator will in general consist of four components .",
    "( here we have already assumed that the diffeomorphism and the @xmath10 gauge condition only involve the metric and the gauge field fluctuation separately . )",

    "the splitting into fluctuations and background configurations has not yet been performed .",
    "an infinitesimal gauge transformation of @xmath66 , considered a scalar functional of its arguments , consists of a diffeomorphism along @xmath6 and an @xmath10 transformation with parameters @xmath7 .",

    "this algebra implies that the total group of gauge transformations , @xmath75 , has the structure of a semi - direct product of the spacetime diffeomorphisms @xmath76 and the local yang - mills transformations @xmath77 , with the latter forming the invariant subalgebra : @xmath78 . whereas the first two relations ( [ ward - d - d ] ) , ( [ ward - l - l ] ) represent the well - known composition laws of diffeomorphisms and yang - mills gauge transformations , the third relation ( [ ward - d - l ] ) lies at the heart of our problem : diffeomorphisms and local gauge transformations do not commute .",
    "instead , they close on the lie derivative of the gauge parameter . in particular",
    ", this implies that diffeomorphisms do not map @xmath10 tensors onto @xmath10 tensors .",
    "what is called for is an @xmath10 covariantization of the ordinary lie derivative .",

    "new diffeomorphisms _ which include a @xmath77 transformation with parameter",
    "@xmath79 @xcite : @xmath80    loosely speaking , this amounts to shifting a certain @xmath81-dependent part of @xmath77 into the diffeomorphism sector .",
    "the notion of an `` invariant functional '' remains unchanged : @xmath82    the algebra relations receive extra contributions now since the ward operators act on the field dependent parameters of the transformations as well .",

    "since , as already mentioned , the metric and gauge field fluctuations do not enter the final form of @xmath85 anyhow , we may safely opt for the latter already at this point :    @xmath86    according to the usual distinction between true and background gauge transformations , we now have to consider two classes of ward operators as well . in the background case ,",
    "the algebraic relations simply carry over , so we have for the ward operators generating background gauge transformations : @xmath87 & = & \\widetilde{\\widetilde{{\\cal w}^{\\rm b}_{\\rm d}}}([v_1 , v_2 ] ) - { \\cal w}^{\\rm b}_{\\rm ym}(v_1 v_2\\cdot \\bar{f})\\\\ \\label{b - ward - l - l}[{\\cal w}^{\\rm b}_{\\rm ym}(\\lambda_1 ) , { \\cal w}^{\\rm b}_{\\rm ym}(\\lambda_2 ) ] & = & { \\cal w}^{\\rm b}_{\\rm ym}(f \\lambda_1\\lambda_2)\\\\ \\label{b - ward - d - l}[\\widetilde{\\widetilde{{\\cal w}^{\\rm b}_{\\rm d}}}(v ) , { \\cal w}^{\\rm b}_{\\rm ym}(\\lambda ) ] & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as for the true gauge transformations , the merely _ background _ field dependent parameter @xmath88 of the compensating @xmath77 transformation is not subject to true gauge transformations .",

    "one has to expand the traces up to terms with two fields @xmath167 and two derivatives acting on them . because of the built - in background gauge invariance those terms should combine to @xmath168 . as a check we verified that this indeed happens .",
    "let us now discuss the result .",
    "here we specialize for @xmath169 spacetime dimensions ; for general @xmath170 the reader is referred to the appendix .",
    "we present three different formulae for @xmath171 ; they differ with respect to the degree of `` rg improvement '' they take into account .",
    "to start with , we `` switch off '' all rg improvements .",
    "this means that we discard all terms in @xmath172 on the rhs of the flow equation where @xmath173 hits either a @xmath131-factor or the @xmath133 in the argument of @xmath136 . in this way",
    "the evaluation of the frge amounts to a one - loop calculation , with a non - standard regulator though .",
    "we find @xmath174 so that @xmath175 here @xmath176 is one of the integrals which were encountered in the pure gravity calculation @xcite already : @xmath177^p}\\qquad & ( n&>0)\\\\ \\phi^p_0(w)&=(1+w)^{-p } & ( n&=0 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second contribution on the rhs of ( [ 4d1loop ] ) is the familiar `` asymptotic freedom '' term due to the self - interaction of the gauge bosons , while the first one , due to the virtual gravitons , is new .",
    "several comments are in order here .    *",
    "( 1 ) * the gravitational correction is manifestly cutoff scheme dependent , i.e. it depends , via @xmath176 , on the shape function @xmath178 .",
    "however , for any admissable choice of @xmath178 the constant @xmath176 is positive . as a result ,",
    "the gravity term has a qualitatively similar impact on @xmath179 as the gauge boson loops , namely to drive @xmath179 smaller at larger @xmath40 .",
    "it tends to speed up the approach of asymptotic freedom .    for the exponential cutoff @xmath180 , for instance ,",
    "one finds @xmath181 , while the `` optimized '' one @xcite , @xmath182 , yields @xmath183 .    *",
    "( 2 ) * the gravitational correction , in perturbative language , originates from a quadratic divergence or , in frge language , a quadratic running with @xmath40 . for this reason its scheme dependence is by no means surprising or alarming",
    "rather , it is the usual situation which is always encountered when the effective average action is applied to matter theories with a quadratic running of parameters , masses , say .",
    "however , one should note that the couplings in @xmath45 as such are not observable or `` physical '' quantities .",
    "the latter must be @xmath178-independent .",
    "this independence comes about by a compensation of the scheme dependence among different running couplings .",
    "( in truncations this compensation might not be perfect . ) in general there will be compensations between effective propagators and vertices , for instance .",
    "analogous remarks apply to the gauge fixing dependence .    *",
    "( 3 ) * the beta function for @xmath184 depends on all three couplings , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 . in the approximation of ( [ 4d1loop ] ) it happens to be independent of @xmath186 , but it does depend on @xmath187 , the dimensionless newton constant .",
    "hence the differential equation for @xmath188 can not be solved in isolation . in principle",
    "the full system ( [ sde ] ) should be considered , and this would include the backreaction of the matter fields on the running of the gravitational parameters @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "we shall not study this backreaction in the present paper .",
    "instead , let us assume that the complete rg trajectory @xmath189 admits a classical regime @xcite in which newton s constant does not run appreciably so that we may approximate @xmath190 this approximation , implicitly , has been made in all perturbative studies @xcite . with ( [ gassumption ] ) , for an abelian field @xmath191 , say , @xmath192 incidentally this beta function has the same general structure as the result by robinson and wilczek @xcite ; it is proportional to @xmath193 and depends explicitly on the energy scale @xmath40 .",
    "its @xmath194-dependence indicates that the underlying quantum effect is related to a quadratic divergence .",
    "( [ abelianresult ] ) is easily solved : @xmath195 . here",
    "@xmath196 and @xmath197 is the ( ordinary , constant ) planck mass . to first order in the @xmath198-expansion",
    "we get @xmath199\\label{kmexpansion}\\ ] ] we note that to leading order newton s constant itself @xcite has an analogous scale dependence , including the sign of the correction : @xmath200 $ ] .    *",
    "( 4 ) * in order to illustrate how the above result fits into the asymptotic safety picture of quantum einstein gravity @xcite we consider a free maxwell field again .",
    "it is known that , in the einstein - hilbert truncation , the rg flow of the average action possesses a non - gaussian fixed point for the two gravitational couplings , @xmath201 , both in pure gravity @xcite and in presence of a free maxwell field @xcite . at this fixed point",
    "the _ dimensionless _ newton constant equals a positive constant , @xmath202 , while the dimensionful one runs to zero quadratically : @xmath203 for @xmath204 . in this regime , @xmath205 the solution to this equation reads @xmath206 at the fixed point the gauge coupling approaches zero according to a power law with a critical exponent @xmath207 , a positive number of order unity . from existing calculations since the determination of @xmath208 in the einstein - maxwell system in ref .",
    "@xcite employs a cutoff different from the present one .",
    "] thus the total system has a non - trivial fixed point of the form @xmath209 .",
    "obviously the approach of @xmath210 is much faster than without gravity where @xmath211 note that @xmath188 is a _ relevant _ parameter , it grows when @xmath40 is lowered , hence it contributes one unit to the dimensionality of the fixed point s uv critical manifold .",
    "next we present the results for @xmath171 with the rg improvements included . in a first step",
    "we retain only the terms which arise when @xmath173 hits the @xmath131-factors in @xmath136 .",
    "those terms are proportional to @xmath171 and @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "as now @xmath171 appears also on the rhs of the rg equation we obtain an implicit equation for it .",
    "its solution reads @xmath213 in this approximation @xmath171 depends not only on newton s but also on the cosmological constant .",
    "( [ 4d1stimproved ] ) resums terms of arbitrary order both in @xmath188 and @xmath185 ; it generalizes a known result @xcite for pure yang - mills theory .",
    "if we go on and include also the terms coming from the scale derivative of @xmath133 in the argument of @xmath214 we are led to @xmath215 the eqs .",

    "( [ 4d2ndimproved ] ) we abbreviated @xmath218 and @xmath219 , respectively .",
    "what is new in ( [ 4d2ndimproved ] ) is the occurrence of the complete beta function of the cosmological constant , @xmath220 .",
    "it originates from the differentiation of the @xmath160-term contained in @xmath133 .",
    "in the recent literature on the gravitational corrections to the yang - mills beta function @xcite there has been a certain amount of confusion as some of the computations do get a non - zero result while others do nt . however , we believe that different calculations have no reason to yield the same result unless they agree on virtually all details of the regularization and renormalization procedure .",
    "the quantum effects of interest are related to quadratic divergences ( or a @xmath194-running ) , and so we should not expect the same high degree of universality as in the case of the familiar gauge boson contribution which is related to a logarithmic divergence .    in the present paper",
    "we computed the beta function for @xmath179 , defined as a coefficient in the derivative expansion of the effective average action .",
    "this approach has two features which are essential here : first , it retains all quadratic divergences ( as opposed to dimensional regularization , say ) , and second , by the background field technique , the regularization ( the cutoff @xmath136 ) preserves gauge invariance . is not gauge fixing independent , though , i.e. we do not use the vilkovisky - dewitt method . ] in this setting , we do get a non - zero gravitational correction .",
    "this correction is scheme and gauge fixing dependent but , as we explained , this is by no means unexpected but rather the usual situation .",
    "when observable quantities are computed from @xmath45 the scheme and gauge fixing dependences will cancel among the different running couplings involved .    among the perturbative calculations",
    "only the one by tang and wu @xcite is directly comparable to ours .",
    "they employ a regulator which retains quadratic divergences and treats them in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "it is gratifying to see that they , too , get a non - zero gravitational correction which has the same structure as ours when we omit the rg improvements .    as a first application of our results we mention",
    "that , by a standard argument , knowledge about the @xmath40-dependence of wave function normalization constants such as @xmath105 can be used in order to deduce information about the related fully dressed propagator implied by @xmath221 . in the case at hand the running inverse propagator of the gauge field , on a flat background , has the form @xmath222 . at high momenta ,",
    "if there is no other relevant physical cutoff scale but the momentum itself , the dressed propagator @xmath223 obtains by setting @xmath224 , whence @xmath225 . for the example of eq .",
    "( [ kmexpansion ] ) , for instance , this leads us to expect that the photon propagator gets modified by a @xmath226-term when @xmath227 approaches the planck scale : @xmath228 likewise the fixed point running of ( [ critexp ] ) implies the following behavior for @xmath229 : @xmath230 as @xmath207 is positive the gauge field propagator falls off faster than @xmath231 , thanks to the quantum gravity corrections .",
    "in fact , the same argument when applied to the graviton propagator leads to a @xmath232-behavior for @xmath229 @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic propagator ( [ propagator ] ) suggests that the quantum gravity corrections improve the finiteness properties of the matter field theory , and this precisely fits into the picture of asymptotic safety .",
    "it is also interesting to note that ( [ propagator ] ) leads to a modified static electromagnetic potential @xmath233 of a classical point charge .",
    "the 3-dimensional fourier transform of ( [ propagator ] ) yields the potential @xmath234 which , if @xmath207 is large enough , could even be regular at @xmath235 .",
    "this makes it obvious that the gravity induced running of the gauge coupling is closely related to the old problem of divergent self energies .",
