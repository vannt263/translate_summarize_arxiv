    "a paradigm shift is now taking place in astronomy and space science .",
    "astronomy has suddenly become an immensely data - rich field , with numerous digital sky surveys across a range of wavelengths , with many terabytes of pixels and with billions of detected sources , often with tens of measured parameters for each object .",
    "we can now map the universe systematically , in a panchromatic manner .",
    "even larger , petabyte - scale astronomical data sets are now on the horizon .",
    "this richness of data will enable quantitatively and qualitatively new science , from statistical studies of our galaxy and the large - scale structure in the universe , to the discoveries of rare , unusual , or even completely new types of astronomical objects and phenomena .",
    "this new data - mining astronomy will also enable and empower scientists and students anywhere , without an access to large telescopes , to do first - rate science .",
    "this will invigorate the field , as it will open the access to unprecedented amounts of data to a fresh pool of talent .    in order to cope with this data avalanche ,",
    "the us astronomical community has started the national virtual observatory ( nvo ) initiative .",
    "the nvo received the highest priority recommendation in the national academy of sciences decadal survey , _ astronomy and astrophysics in the new millennium_. this is becoming an international effort , leading to a global virtual observatory , as it was clearly apparent at this conference and an earlier meeting in pasadena ( brunner 2001a ) .",
    "full and effective scientific exploitation the vast new data volumes poses considerable technical and even deeper , methodological challenges .",
    "the traditional astronomical data analysis methods are inadequate to cope with this sudden increase in the _ data volume _",
    "( by several orders of magnitude ) , and especially _ data complexity _ ( tens or hundreds of dimensions of the parameter space ) . in this review",
    "we address the opportunities and problems posed by the application of automated classification or clustering analysis in the context of large digital sky surveys , in a future virtual observatory ( vo ) .",
    "these challenges require substantive collaborations and partnerships between astronomy and computer science , promising to bring advances to both fields .",
    "a major type of the scientific studies we anticipate for a vo is a systematic exploration of parameter spaces of measured source attributes from large digital sky surveys .",
    "this is already done at some level in the catalog domain , where every source is represented as a point or vector in a multidimensional parameter space ; however , much more ambitious and complex applications are forthcoming , especially with multiple sky surveys federated within a vo . in the future",
    ", we can also contemplate such explorations in the image or pixel domain , or in combination of catalog and image domains .",
    "also , adding the time axis , from synoptic and sky monitoring surveys , would both literally and metaphorically add a new dimension for this type of studies .",
    "for example , we can exploit the sheer size of the data sets ( billions of detected sources ) to find rare types of objects ( one in a million , or one in a billion , down to some survey flux limit ) , and use the rich information content ( or complexity ) of the data , tens or hundreds of measured parameters , to achieve optimal discrimination of interesting types of objects from the more common species .",
    "this includes an exciting possibility of discovering some previously unknown types of astronomical objects or phenomena . for a related review ,",
    "see djorgovski ( 2001 ) .",
    "more generally , we see the exploration of observable parameter spaces , created by combining of large sky surveys over a range of wavelengths , as one of the chief scientific purposes of a vo .",
    "a complete observable parameter space axes include quantities such as the object coordinates , velocities or redshifts , sometimes proper motions , fluxes at a range of wavelength ( i.e. , spectra ; imaging in a set of bandpasses can be considered a form of a very low resolution spectroscopy ) , surface brightness and image morphological parameters for resolved sources , variability ( or , more broadly , power spectra ) over a range of time scales ,   any given sky survey samples only a small portion of this grand observable parameter space , and is subject to its own selection and measurement limits , limiting fluxes , surface brightness , angular resolution , spectroscopic resolution , sampling and baseline for variability if multiple epoch observations are obtained ,    thus , any given sky survey provides only a very limited picture of the universe , but hopefully with the well understood limitations . an intelligent combination of multiple sky surveys within a vo provides a way of overcoming some of these limitations and enabling a more complete ( panchromatic , multi - scale , synoptic , ) view of the physical universe",
    ".    sometimes simply a combination of sky surveys from very different wavelengths can produce great new discoveries : recall the discovery of quasars and powerful radio galaxies as optical ids of radio sources from the first radio surveys ; or , the discoveries of all kinds of x - ray sources from the optical follow - up of the early x - ray missions ; or the ultraluminous sources found by iras ; and so on ... yet , the multiwavelength studies envisioned for a vo would be far more comprehensive and ambitious , sampling the previously poorly known portions of the observable parameter space .",
    "an early vision of such systematic exploration of the observable universe was promoted by zwicky ( zwicky 1957 ) , who was  as usual  far ahead of his time , and unfortunately limited by the observational technology available to him .",
    "further ideas along these lines have been discussed by harwit ( 1975 ) and harwit & hildebrand ( 1986 ) .",
    "these authors recognised that fundamentally new discoveries can be made by opening of the new portions of the observable parameter space . with the plethora of large digital sky surveys now coming on line , and the technologies developed for their exploration and analysis",
    ", we are now starting to fulfill this vision .",
    "there is already a booming industry of searches for rare , but known types of astronomical objects in large digital sky surveys , such as the high-@xmath0 quasars or brown dwarfs .",
    "the rarity may be simply the consequence of the observational selection ; for example , brown dwarfs must be very common in the universe , they are just hard to find . with a known type of objects , their properties ( typical spectra )",
    "can be convolved with the survey instrumental parameters , such as the bandpasses , flux limits , , and a particular region of the parameter space where such objects should be found can be designated for their selection .",
    "examples of searches for high-@xmath0 quasars include , warren ( 1987 ) , irwin ( 1991 ) , kennefick ( 1995a , 1995b ) , fan ( 1999 , 2000a , 2000c ) ,   the analogous technique is now commonly used to select galaxies at very high redshifts ( steidel 1999 , or dickinson 2000 , and references therein ) . examples of searches for brown dwarfs include , kirkpatrick ( 1999 ) , strauss ( 1999 ) , burgasser ( 2000 ) , fan ( 2000b ) , leggett ( 2000 ) ,    in the case of spatially unresolved sources ( `` starlike '' in optical and nir ) , the only discriminating information between physically different kinds of sources is in the broad - band spectral energy distribution , which can be parametrised as a set of the flux ratios ( colors ) between different bandpasses ; the searches are then done in the color parameter space .",
    "such photometrically selected candidates are then followed up spectroscopically .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 1",
    ", on an example of color selection of high-@xmath0 and type-2 quasars discovered in the digital palomar observatory sky survey ( dposs ; see djorgovski 1998 ; and in prep . ) .",
    "normal stars form a temperature sequence , seen here as a banana - shaped locus of points in this color space .",
    "the spectra of these types of quasars , when folded through the survey filter curves produce discrepant colors which distinguish them from those of normal stars .     a representative color - color plot for objects classified as psf - like in dposs .",
    "the dots are normal stars with @xmath1 mag .",
    "solid circles are some of the @xmath2 quasars , and open circles are some of the type-2 quasars found in this survey .  @xmath3   a spectrum of a typical @xmath2 quasar , with the dposs bandpasses shown as the dotted lines .",
    "the mean flux drop blueward of the ly@xmath4 line , caused by the absorption by ly@xmath4 forest and sometimes a lyman - limit system , gives these objects a very red @xmath5 color , while their intrinsic blue color is retained in @xmath6 , placing them in the lower right portion of this color - color diagram .",
    "@xmath7   a spectrum of a typical type-2 quasar , with the dposs bandpasses shown as the dotted lines .",
    "the presence of the strong [ o iii ] lines is the @xmath8 band places such objects below the stellar locus in this color - color diagram .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    in the case of high-@xmath0 quasars , absorption by the intergalactic hydrogen clouds and gas - rich ( proto)galaxies produces a strong drop blueward of the quasar s own ly@xmath4 emission line center , and thus a very red @xmath5 color , while the observed @xmath6 color reflects the intrinsically blue spectrum of the quasars : these objects are `` red in the blue , and blue in the red '' , unlike any ordinary stars . to date ,",
    "@xmath9 such quasars have been found in dposs.george/z4.qsos ]    in the case of type-2 quasars the with hidden central engines ( nonthermal continuum and broad - line regions ) but with the ( mostly ? ) unobscured narrow - line regions , presence of the strong , narrow emission lines in one of the survey bands can produce peculiar colors . for the type-2 quasars discovered in dposs ( djorgovski 1999 , and in prep . ) , the strong [ o iii ] lines traverse the @xmath8 band in the redshift interval @xmath10 , and separate these objects in the color space away from the stellar locus .",
    "both of these types of objects are relatively rare , with surface densities @xmath11 deg@xmath12 down to the reliable star - galaxy classification limit in dposs , i.e. , down to @xmath13 mag .",
    "thus , one must have a survey covering both a large area , and going sufficiently deep , in order to detect statistically meaningful samples of them , as well as the suitable selection methodology .",
    "a similar approach is used in surveys with a poor angular resolution at other wavelengths , e.g. , as a star - galaxy separation in iras data ( boller 1992 ) , or as a way of distinguishing likely quasars from radio galaxies using a spectral index in the radio , or using the x - ray hardness ratio to separate agn from other types of sources , complete samples of quasars at all redshifts can be generated using similar approaches in the optical and nir ( wolf 1999 , and this volume ; or warren 2000 ) .",
    "likewise , stars of a particular spectral type can be selected and used as probes of the galactic structure ( yanny 2000 ) .",
    "if morphological parameters of resolved galaxies can be parametrised in some suitable manner , the same approach can be used to isolate galaxies in some range of hubble types ( odewahn 1996 ) .",
    "however , an even more intriguing prospect is the discovery of rare and previously @xmath14 types of objects in these large data sets , which may have been missed so far due to the rarity , and/or the blending with some more familiar types ( all unresolved sources look alike on images ) .",
    "they may be uncovered through a systematic search for outliers in some parameter space , as objects empirically distinct from `` everything else '' in a statistically quantifiable manner .",
    "possible examples of new kinds of objects ( or at least extremely rare or peculiar sub - species of known types of objects ) have been found in the course of high-@xmath0 quasar searches by both sdss ( fan & strauss , priv .",
    "comm . ) and dposs groups .",
    "some examples from dposs are shown in figure 2 .",
    "these objects have most unusual , and as yet not fully ( or not at all ) understood spectra , which cause them to have peculiar broad - band colors , which serendipitously place them in the region of the color space where high-@xmath0 quasars are to be found .",
    "quasar search .",
    "the top one , pss 1537 + 1227 , has been identified as an extreme case of a rare type of a low - ionisation , fe - rich , bal qso , at @xmath15 . a prototype case ( but with a spectrum not quite as extreme as this )",
    "is first 0840 + 3633 , discovered by becker ( 1997 ) .",
    "the nature of the other two remains uncertain as of this writing , but it is possible that they are also some peculiar sub - species of bal qsos ; but perhaps they are something else entirely .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    a systematic search for outliers in other , as yet unexplored portions of this parameter space may yield additional peculiar objects , some of which may turn out to be prototypes of new astrophysical phenomena .",
    "a thorough , large - scale , unbiased , multi - wavelength census of the universe will any such new types of objects and phenomena , if they do exist and are detectable in the available data . these may be exciting new discoveries with a vo .",
    "in addition to the searches for the rare , natural phenomena , this methodology ( and perhaps also some of the vo data sets ) can form a basis for a generalised and more powerful approach to seti ( djorgovski 2000 ) .",
    "separation of the data into different types of objects , be it known or unknown in nature , can be approached as a problem in automated classification or clustering analysis .",
    "this is a part of a more general and rapidly growing field of data mining ( dm ) and knowledge discovery in databases ( kdd ) .",
    "we see here great opportunities for collaborations between astronomers and computer scientists and statisticians . for an overview of some of the issues and methods ,",
    "see the volume edited by fayyad ( 1996b ) , as well as several papers in this volume .",
    "if applied in the catalog domain , the data can be viewed as a set of @xmath16 points or vectors in an @xmath17-dimensional parameter space , where @xmath16 can be in the range of many millions or even billions , and @xmath17 in the range of a few tens to hundreds .",
    "the data may be clustered in @xmath18 statistically distinct classes , which could be modeled , as multivariate gaussian clouds , and which hopefully correspond to physically distinct classes of objects ( stars , galaxies , quasars , ) .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in figure 4 .",
    ", @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ( some flux ratios or morphological paremeters ) , and most of the data points belong to 3 major clusters , denoted @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( stars , galaxies , and ordinary quasars ) .",
    "one approach is to isolate these major classes of objects for some statistical studies , stars as probes of the galactic structure , or galaxies as probes of the large scale structure of the universe , and filter out the `` anomalous '' objects .",
    "a complementary view is to look for other , less populated , but statistically significant , distinct clusters of data points , or even individual outliers , as possible examples of rare or unknown types of objects .",
    "another possibility is to look for holes ( negative clusters ) within the major clusters , as they may point to some interesting physical phenomenon  or to a problem with the data .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    a typical vo data set may have the following properties : @xmath24 data vectors in @xmath25 dimensions ( these are measured source attributes , including positions , fluxes in different bandpasses , morphology quantified through different moments of light distribution and other suitably constructed parameters , ) .",
    "some of the parameters would be primary measurements , and others may be derived attributes , such as the star - galaxy classification ( e.g. , from a supervised classifier such as an artificial neural net , or some bayesian scheme ) , some may be `` flags '' rather than numbers , some would have error - bars associated with them , and some would not , and the error - bars may be functions of some of the parameters , e.g. , fluxes",
    ". some measurements would be present only as upper or lower limits",
    ". some would be affected by `` glitches '' due to instrumental problems , and if a data set consists of a merger of two or more surveys , e.g. , cross - matched optical , infrared , and radio ( and this would be a common scenario within a vo ) , then some sources would be misidentified , and thus represent erroneous combinations of subsets of data dimensions .",
    "surveys would be also affected by selection effects operating explicitly on some parameters ( e.g. , coordinate ranges , flux limits , ) , but also mapping onto some other data dimensions through correlations of these properties ; some selection effects may be unknown .",
    "physically , the data set may consist of a number of distinct classes of objects , such as stars ( including a range of spectral types ) , galaxies ( including a range of hubble types or morphologies ) , quasars , within each object class or subclass , some of the physical properties may be correlated , and some of these correlations may be already known and some as yet unknown , and their discovery would be an important scientific result by itself .",
    "correlations of independently measured physical parameters represent a reduction of the statistical dimensionality in a multidimensional data parameter space , and their discovery may be an integral part of the clustering analysis .",
    "if the number of object classes @xmath18 is known ( or declared ) _ a priori _ , and training data set of representative objects is available , the problem reduces to supervised classification , where tools such as artificial neural nets or decision trees can be used .",
    "this is now commonly done for star - galaxy separation in the optical or nir sky surveys ( odewahn 1992 , or weir 1995 ) .",
    "searches for known types of objects with predictable signatures in the parameter space ( high-@xmath0 quasars ) can be also cast in this way .",
    "however , a more interesting and less biased approach is where the number of classes @xmath18 is not known , and it has to be derived from the data themselves .",
    "the problem of unsupervised classification is to determine this number in some objective and statistically sound manner , and then to associate class membership probabilities for all objects .",
    "majority of objects may fall into a small number of classes , normal stars or galaxies .",
    "what is of special interest are objects which belong to much less populated clusters , or even individual outliers with low membership probabilities for any major class .",
    "some initial experiments with unsupervised clustering algorithms in the astronomical context include , goebel ( 1989 ) , weir ( 1995 ) , de carvalho ( 1995 ) , and yoo ( 1996 ) , but a full - scale application to major digital sky surveys yet remains to be done .",
    "intriguing applications which addressed the issue of how many statistically distinct classes of grbs are there include mukherjee ( 1998 ) and rogier ( 2000 ) .",
    "one method we have been experimenting with ( applied on the various data sets derived from dposs ) is the expectation maximisation ( em ) technique , with the monte carlo cross validation ( mccv ) as the way of determining the maximum likelihood number of the clusters .",
    "an array of good unsupervised classification techniques will be an essential part of a vo toolkit .",
    "this may be a computationally very expensive problem .",
    "for the simple @xmath26-means algorithm , the computing cost scales as @xmath27 , where @xmath26 is the number of clusters chosen _ a priori _ , @xmath28 is the number of data vectors ( detected objects ) , @xmath29 is the number of iterations , and @xmath30 is the number of data dimensions ( measured parameters per object ) . for",
    "the more powerful expectation maximisation technique , the cost scales as @xmath31 , and again one must decide _ a priori _ on the value of @xmath26 .",
    "if this number has to be determined intrinsically from the data , with the monte carlo cross validation method , the cost scales as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of monte carlo trials / partitions , and @xmath34 is the maximum number of clusters tried . even with the typical numbers for the existing large digital sky surveys ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) this is already reaching in the realm of terascale computing , especially in the context of an interactive and iterative application of these analysis tools .",
    "development of faster and smarter algorithms is clearly a priority .",
    "one technique which can simplify the problem is the multi - resolution clustering . in this regime ,",
    "expensive parameters to estimate , such as the number of classes and the initial broad clustering are quickly estimated using traditional techniques , and then one could proceed to refine the model locally and globally by iterating until some objective statistical ( bayesian ) criterion is satisfied .    one can also use intelligent sampling methods where one forms `` prototypes''of the case vectors and thus reduces the number of cases to process .",
    "prototypes can be determined from simple algorithms to get a rough estimate , and then refined using more sophisticated techniques .",
    "a clustering algorithm can operate in prototype space .",
    "the clusters found can later refined by locally replacing each prototype by its constituent population and reanalyzing the cluster .",
    "techniques for dimensionality reduction , including principal component analysis and others can be used as preprocessing techniques to automatically derive the dimensions that contain most of the relevant information .",
    "there are many other technical and methodological challenges in this quest , primarily the problems steming from the heterogeneity and intrinsic complexity of the data , including treatment of upper an lower limits , missing data , selection effects and data censoring , these issues affect the proper statistical description of the data , which then must be reflected in the clustering algorithms .    related to this",
    "are the problems arising from the data modeling .",
    "the commonly used assumption of clusters represented as multivariate gaussian clouds is rarely a good descriptor of the reality .",
    "clusters may have non - gaussian shapes , exponential or power - law tails , asymmetries , sharp cutoffs ,   this becomes a critical issue in evaluating the membership probabilities in partly overlapping clusters , or in a search for outliers ( anomalous events ) in the tails of the distributions .",
    "in general , the proper functional forms for the modeling of clusters are not known _ a priori _ , and must be discovered from the data .",
    "applications of non - parametric techniques may be essential here . a related , very interesting problem is posed by the _ topology _ of clustering , with a possibility of multiply - connected clusters or gaps in the data ( negative clusters embedded within the positive ones ) , hierarchical or multi - scale clustering ( clusters embedded within the clusters )    the clusters may be well separated in some of the dimensions , but not in others . how can we objectively decide which dimensions are irrelevant , and which ones are useful ?",
    "an automated and objective rejection of the `` useless '' dimensions , perhaps through some statistically defined enthropy criterion , could greatly simplify and speed up the clustering analysis .",
    "once the data are partitioned into distinct clusters , their analysis and interpretation starts .",
    "one question is , are there interesting ( in general , multivariate ) correlations among the properties of objects in any given cluster",
    "? such correlations may reflect interesting new astrophysics ( , the stellar main sequence , the tully - fisher and fundamental plane correlations for galaxies , ) , but at the same time complicate the statistical interpretation of the clustering .",
    "they would be in general restricted to a subset of the dimensions , and not present in the others .",
    "how do we identify all of the interesting correlations , and discriminate against the `` uninteresting '' observables ?    given these issues , a blind applications of",
    "the commonly used ( commercial or home - brewed ) clustering algorithms in such real - life cases could produce some seriously misleading or simply wrong results .",
    "the clustering methodology must be robust enough to cope with these problems , and the outcome of the analysis must have a solid statistical foundation .",
    "effective and powerful data visualization , applied in the parameter space itself , is another essential part of the interactive clustering analysis .",
    "good visualisation tools are also essential for the interpretation of results , especially in an iterative environment . while clustering algorithms can assist in the partitioning of the data space , and",
    "can draw the attention to anomalous objects , ultimately a scientist guides the experiment and draws the conclusions .",
    "another key issue is interoperability and reusability of algorithms and models in a wide variety of problems posed by a rich data environment such as federated digital sky surveys in a vo .    finally , a scientific verification and evaluation , testing , and follow - up on any of the newly discovered classes of objects , physical clusters discovered by these methods , and other astrophysical analysis of the results is essential in order to demonstrate the actual usefulness of these techniques for a vo or other applications .",
    "clustering analysis can be seen as a prelude to the more traditional type of astronomical studies , as a way of selecting of interesting objects of samples .",
    "the current generation of digital sky surveys provides `` extended snapshots '' of the sky , at some set of wavelengths .",
    "but the future brings the `` movies '' . a major new area for exploration will be in the time domain , with a number of ongoing or forthcoming surveys aiming to map large portions of the sky in a repeated fashion , down to very faint flux levels .",
    "in addition to a large number of ongoing microlensing surveys , searches for solar system objects , supernova surveys , and other searches for variable or transient sources at optical wavelengths , many more are being planned or proposed ; the ultimate such experiment would be the large synoptic survey telescope , which received a high recommendation in the nas decadal survey .",
    "the subject is reviewed , by paczyski ( 2000 ; and this volume ) and diercks ( 2001 ) .",
    "plate image with an @xmath37 mag , starlike object , circled .",
    "the object was selected due to its apparent peculiar color ( bright in @xmath8 , extremely faint in the other two dposs bands ) ; however , this was simply a consequence of the plates taken at different times , with one of them catching it in a bright state .",
    "bottom : a portion of the corresponding keck @xmath38 band image .",
    "the dposs transient was positionally coincident with an @xmath39 mag galaxy , with an estimated probable @xmath40 .",
    "at such a redshift , this object would have been a few hundred times brighter than a supernova at its peak .",
    "it may be an example of a grb `` orphan afterglow '' , or possibly some other , new type of a transient .",

    "the observation epochs are indicated below each panel .",
    "the star was brighter by at least a factor of 300 on the @xmath28 plate taken on 1990.1793 ut .",
    "its subsequent spectroscopy shows normal , early - type absorption spectrum , with no line emission .",
    "the cause , amplitude , and duration of the outburst are unknown .",
    "how many normal stars do this , how often , and why ? new synoptic sky surveys may help answer this . [ fig5 ] ]    while these surveys may start generating petabytes of data , they will open a whole new field of searches for variable astronomical objects . by analogy with the searches for rare types of objects in the image domain , we can expect both assembly of large , statistical samples of known types of variables ( variable stars of all kinds , supernov , and agn ) , as well as possible new types of variable or transient objects .",
    "we know surprisingly little about the faint , variable sky at any wavelength , and over most time scales .",
    "a panchromatic approach to the variable universe is long overdue .",
    "dm techniques described above can be applied directly to the analysis of such data .    as an illustration of the kind of unexpected phenomena which may be found ,",
    "we show here a couple of examples drawn from dposs .",
    "the poss - ii plates in different filters are taken at different times , so that highly variable objects would appear as having peculiar colors ( much brighter in one band than in the others ) . also , about 50% of the northern sky which dposs covers is imaged at least twice in each band due to plate overlaps .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of a serendipitously discovered optical transient associated with a faint galaxy .",
    "figure 5 shows a star seen in a plate overlap region ( photographed twice in each of the 3 bands ) , which was brighter by at least a factor of 300 during one of the exposures ( it is a lower limit , since the image is saturated , and also the outburst may have lasted less than the plate exposure time , but it is averaged over it ) .",
    "these extreme events have been picked up serendipitously in the course of other dposs work .",
    "a systematic search for variable or transient sources is likely to yield many more .    ]    likewise , the low surface brightness universe ( at any wavelength ! ) remains as one of the remaining frontiers . for reviews ,",
    "see , impey & bothun ( 1997 ) , or schombert ( 2001 ) , and references therein . in a more general sense",
    ", we can cast the problem as the detection of sources at a range of surface brightness contrasts over a range of scales , and possibly with a range of image morphologies .",
    "practically every implemented source detection algorithm has a preferred range of angular scales and a limiting surface brightness at any given angular scale .",
    "exploration of novel source or structure detection algorithms seems to be in order .",
    "broadening of the dynamical range of the limiting surface brightness and software - limited angular resolution in digital sky surveys at any wavelength would be an important area of work in a vo .    as a demonstration of the type of science which is facilitated by a virtual observatory",
    ", we have undertaken a project utilizing both images and catalogs to explore the multi - wavelength , low surface brightness universe ( brunner 2001b ; and in prep . ;",
    "see also testa , this volume ) .",
    "our analysis techniques are complimentary to normal data reduction pipeline techniques in that we focus on the diffuse emission that is ignored or removed by more traditional algorithms .",
    "this requires a spatial filtering which must account for objects of interest , in addition to observational artifacts ( bright stellar halos ) . with this work we are exploring the intersection of the catalog and image domains in order to maximize the scientific information we can extract from the federation of large survey data .",
    "additional field to explore may be the use of automated pattern recognition algorithms applied in the image domain , rather than in some parameter space of derived object attributes , the catalog domain ( thus perhaps bypassing the tricky problem of source detection ) .",
    "such `` artificial vision '' tools may be used to discover sources with a particular image morphology ( galaxies of a certain type ) .",
    "an example from planetary science , an automated discovery of volcanos in magellan venus radar images , was described in fayyad ( 1996a ) and burl ( 1998 ) .",
    "an even more interesting approach would be to employ ai techniques to search through panoramic images ( perhaps matched from multiple wavelengths ) for unusual image patterns , possibly correlated with some data context ( always found in or near a cluster of galaxies , or a molecular cloud , or coincident with a spiral galaxy , ) . for example , it may be possible for a program to find features such as the gravitationally lensed arcs in rich clusters ( perhaps in a way which may mimic the discovery process in the minds of lynds & petrosian 1989 ) , but possibly also some other , as yet unknown phenomena .",
    "the technical problems posed by the analysis of the vo - related data sets are considerable , but within our reach .",
    "these problems are common to all data - intensive fields today .",
    "however , we believe that astronomy is `` just right '' as a testbed for these computing methodologies : the size and complexity of the data sets is nontrivial , but is manageable , providing rewarding challenges for applied information science .",
    "we thus envision a continuous , powerful synergy of astronomy and information sciences in tackling these challenges .",
    "the scientific applications will not be lacking : once the means are available , both the data and the exploration tools , some exciting science will result , including many things we have never thought about .",
    "one of the most important aspects of a vo is the opening of the field to a broader , world - wide pool of talent , including many scientists and students without a ready access to the front - line observational facilities , but with good ideas .",
    "the ultimate , long - term future of observational astronomy may be in pushing the observations of the universe along all of the physically accessible axes of the parameter space , over the entire available electromagnetic spectrum and other information channels , the neutrinos , gravity waves , cosmic rays , clever uses of gravitational lensing to `` observe '' the dark matter ,   in principle we could be doing it down to the physical limits such as the quantum noise or opacity of the galactic ism  and in the form of a continuous monitoring of the entire sky , at all wavelengths .",
    "of course , there will always be some technical limits ( angular diffraction resolution limits due to the physical size of available telescopes or arrays , detector technology , ) , and practical limits ( cost ) .",
    "this may sound like an insanely ambitious vision today , but think what would , say , any good , early 20th century astronomer think about the array of telescopes , sky surveys , and various tools at our disposal today .",
    "if there is any lesson in the past , then it is that we can not even imagine what will be possible to do , what will be found , and what will be interesting to do a few decades from now .",
    "astronomy has always pushed the limits of technology for its purposes , be it optics , telescope design , or detectors .",
    "we are now doing the same with the information technology .",
    "the vo concept opens a path towards a systematic , complete exploration of the universe , and gives us a preview and a vision of the astronomy of the future .",
    "* acknowledgements . *   prototyping vo developments at caltech and jpl have been funded by grants from nasa , the caltech president s fund , and several private donors .",
    "the processing and initial exploration of dposs was supported by a generous gift from the norris foundation , and by other private donors .",
    "we are grateful to all people who helped with the creation of dposs and with our palomar and keck observing runs , and especially a number of excellent caltech undergraduates who worked with us through the years .",
    "finally , we wish to acknowledge stimulating interactions with other vo enthusiasts from pasadena and other corners of the planet .",

    "<S> we review some of the scientific opportunities and technical challenges posed by the exploration of the large digital sky surveys , in the context of a virtual observatory ( vo ) . the vo paradigm will profoundly change the way observational astronomy is done . clustering analysis techniques can be used to discover samples of rare , unusual , or even previously unknown types of astronomical objects and phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> exploration of the previously poorly probed portions of the observable parameter space are especially promising . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate some of the possible types of studies with examples drawn from dposs ; much more complex and interesting applications are forthcoming . </S>",
    "<S> development of the new tools needed for an efficient exploration of these vast data sets requires a synergy between astronomy and information sciences , with great potential returns for both fields . </S>"
