    "the carina nebula is a complex star forming region situated at a distance of @xmath2  kpc from the sun . with more than @xmath3 massive stars identified @xcite ,",
    "it is an ideal site to study the impact of stellar feedback on the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this highly dynamical environment",
    "massive stars affect the surrounding medium through photoionizing radiation , stellar winds and ultimately through supernova explosions .",
    "observations and numerical simulations have shown that these mechanisms can produce various observable morphologies like superbubbles at large scales @xcite , cavities @xcite , shells or pillars @xcite .",
    "the feedback mechanisms at work during the lifetime of the massive stars ( before the supernova ) may not play the most dominant role on larger scales @xcite .",
    "however , these processes can affect the star formation locally by either triggering the formation of new stars or dispersing clouds and thereby delaying or even hindering star formation @xcite .",
    "in addition to the feedback mechanisms mentioned above , the dynamical evolution of these massive stars is also likely to affect the surroundings .",
    "while most of the massive stars are believed to lie within their native ob association and are likely to be part of a binary or multiple system @xcite , some stars with quite high velocities , so called runaways , have been observed outside of ob associations @xcite .    in this article",
    "we take a look at multi - wavelength observations of a peculiar nebulosity around a star in the carina nebula and the identification of a denser molecular clump at the same location .",

    "we discuss a possible link between the star , the sickle and the clump and argue that the star is moving supersonically through the ambient density gradient on the front side of the observed compact clump .",
    "the object caught our attention because of its peculiar morphology in our inspection of optical images of the carina nebula region .",
    "it is located about @xmath4 south - east of the dense young cluster tr  14 , which corresponds to a projected physical distance of about 0.8  pc .",
    "a literature search showed that the peculiar nebulosity had already been mentioned in the near - infrared ( nir ) imaging study of the tr  14 region by , who suggested the idea of a compact hii region around the star .",
    "the highly asymmetric shape of the nebula could be the result of the irradiation from the very luminous early o - type stars in the center of tr  14 ( most notably the o2if star hd 93129a ) , since the apex of the crescent points toward this direction .",
    "@xcite , however , noted that the lack of detectable h@xmath5 emission is in conflict with the interpretation as an hii region ; they rather argued that the crescent nebula is a dusty bow shock .",
    "our investigation of the comprehensive multi - wavelength data set of the carina nebula that we compiled during the last years shows that the crescent nebula also appears to be related to a compact clump , which is ( naturally ) invisible in the optical and nir images , but quite prominent in our far - infrared and sub - mm data .",

    "the non - axisymmetric appearance of the sickle is consistent with the presence of a density gradient perpendicular to the direction of motion of mj  218 , which coincides with the line - of - sight and the location of the clump .",

    "<S> optical and near - infrared images of the carina nebula show a peculiar arc - shaped feature , which we call the `` sickle '' , next to the b - type star _ trumpler  14 mj  218_. we use multi - wavelength observations to explore and constrain the nature and origin of the nebulosity . using sub - mm data from apex / laboca as well as _ </S>",
    "<S> herschel _ far - infrared maps , we discovered a dense , compact clump with a mass of @xmath0 located close to the apex of the sickle . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the b - star mj  218 , the sickle , and the clump are related . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations show that , in principle , a b - type star located near the edge of a clump can produce a crescent - shaped wind shock front , similar to the observed morphology . however , the observed proper motion of mj  218 suggest that the star moves with high velocity ( @xmath1 ) through the ambient interstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the star is just about to graze along the surface of the clump , and the sickle is a bow shock induced by the stellar wind , as the object moves supersonically through the density gradient in the envelope of the clump . </S>"
