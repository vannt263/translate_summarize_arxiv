    "our results for the nodal ground states in the vb are obtained from the complementary @xmath0 and tb models and further supported by a simple picture from a continuum model , thus ruling out that an unconventional level ordering could be limited to an artifact of a single method . moreover",
    ", the transparency of our approach provides also a microscopic understanding for the evolution of the nodal states to the top of the vb and the related orbital ordering .",
    "we report a striking difference between the orbital textures of the nodal and nodeless states .",

    "similar pioneering experiments have already been performed in ii - vi epitaxially grown qds.@xcite when spin of the single mn atom ( @xmath38 ) is decoupled from from carriers in the qd , corresponding photoluminescence line will be ( @xmath39)-fold degenerate .",

    "this exchange interaction lifts the sixfold mn degeneracy with the splitting proportional to the modulus squared of the wavefunction at the mn position .    for a conventional nodeless @xmath1-like hole state",
    ", the degeneracy of the observed photoluminescence would display multiple peaks in the spectrum .",
    "experiments are often carried out with asymmetrically shaped qds and in case of flat self - assembled qds,@xcite the degeneracy of these multiplets is two , corresponding to the heavy - hole @xmath45 and @xmath46 components of the exciton .",
    "each of the six doublets can be labelled by @xmath47:@xcite from the ground state @xmath48 , @xmath49 , to the highest energy state @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the measured magnitude of the @xmath1-like state splitting in ( cd , mn)te qd was on the order of 1  mev.@xcite in contrast , if the mn atom is located at the center of a cubic or spherical qd , the nodal @xmath2-like state should suppress the hole - mn exchange interaction ( as the node in an envelope function coincides with the mn location ) , producing no splitting in the photoluminescence .",
    "schematically , these two outcomes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] and could be used to identify the reversed level ordering and the nodal ground state in the vb .",
    "we also point out that from the theoretical point of view , the @xmath2-like state should survive in asymmetrical qds as we discuss in appendix d.    in an idealized @xmath0 model of a strong electron and hole confinement , the optical selection rules would give a vanishing radiative transition between the orthogonal @xmath1- and @xmath2-like states in the cb and vb , respectively .",
    "this is not the case in realistic qds of ill - defined parity .",
    "the photoluminescence peak for the nodal state would be partially suppressed , but not vanish , as compared to the nodeless state and indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : pl ] .",
    "in fact , our proposed scenario for the photoluminescence signature of the nodal states is providing motivation to revisit measurements of qds with single mn.@xcite however , an appropriate identification would still require a detailed data analysis which we hope will be stimulated by our predictions for the vb orbital ordering and its implications .    focusing on magnetically - doped qds with many mn impurities could also provide a useful test if our understanding of orbital ordering can lead to additional means of controlling magnetism .",
    "for example , it was predicted  @xcite that an electrostatic deformation of a quantum confinement could reversibly turn _ on _ and _ off _ the magnetic ordering of mn spins , even at a fixed number of carriers .",
    "this was expected to be a consequence of the confinement - induced change in the carrier spin state .",
    "in contrast , even without changing the carrier spin state , our analysis for altering the ordering of between the nodeless and nodal states would imply a change in the exchange interaction ( as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] ) and thus modify the magnetic ordering .",
    "a further motivation for our studies of nodal ground states in semiconductor nanostructures is provided by their experimental observation in other confined systems with multiband electronic structure of the host lattice near the band edge .",
