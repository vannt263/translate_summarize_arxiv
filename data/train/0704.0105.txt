    "a well - studied and easy to visualize rigidity property of subsets of a symplectic manifold @xmath0 is the rigidity of intersections : a subset @xmath1 can not be displaced from the closure of a subset @xmath2 by a compactly supported hamiltonian isotopy : @xmath3 we say in such a case that @xmath4 _ can not be displaced _ from @xmath5 . if @xmath4 can not be displaced from itself we call it _",
    "non - displaceable_. these properties become especially interesting and purely symplectic when @xmath4 can be displaced from itself or from @xmath5 by a ( compactly supported ) smooth isotopy .",
    "one of the main themes of the present paper is that _  some non - displaceable sets are more rigid than others . \" _ to explain this , we need the following ramifications of the notion of a non - displaceable set :    strong non - displaceability : a subset @xmath1 is called _ strongly non - displaceable _ if one can not displace it by any ( not necessarily hamiltonian ) symplectomorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "stable non - displaceability : consider @xmath6 with the coordinates @xmath7 and the symplectic form @xmath8 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is _ stably non - displaceable _ if @xmath9 is non - displaceable in @xmath10 equipped with the split symplectic form @xmath11 .",
    "let us mention that detecting stably non - displaceable subsets is useful for studying geometry and dynamics of hamiltonian flows ( see for instance @xcite for their role in hofer s geometry and @xcite for their appearance in the context of kick stability in hamiltonian dynamics )",
    ".    formally speaking , the properties of strong and stable non - displaceability are mutually independent and both are strictly stronger than displaceability .    in the present paper",
    "we refine the machinery of partial symplectic quasi - states introduced in @xcite and get new examples of stably non - displaceable sets , including certain fibers of moment maps of hamiltonian torus actions as well as monotone lagrangian submanifolds discussed by albers @xcite and biran - cornea @xcite . further , we address the following question : given the class of stably non - displaceable sets , can one distinguish those of them which are also strongly non - displaceable by means of the floer theory ? or , other way around , what are the floer - homological features of stably non - displaceable but strongly displaceable sets ?",
    "toy examples are given by the equator of the symplectic two - sphere and by the meridian on a symplectic two - torus .",
    "both are stably non - displaceable since their lagrangian floer homologies are non - trivial . on the other hand ,",
    "the equator is strongly non - displaceable , while the meridian is strongly displaceable by a non - hamiltonian shift .",
    "later on we shall explain the difference between these two examples from the viewpoint of hamiltonian floer homology and present various generalizations .",
    "the question on floer - homological characterization of ( strongly ) non - displaceable but stably displaceable sets is totally open , see section  [ subsubsec - pack ] below for an example involving gromov s packing theorem and discussion .",
    "leaving floer - theoretical considerations for the next section , let us outline ( in parts , informally ) the general scheme of our results : given a symplectic manifold @xmath0 , we shall define ( in the language of the floer theory ) two collections of closed subsets of @xmath12 , _ heavy subsets _ and _ superheavy subsets_. every superheavy subset is heavy , but , in general , not vice versa .",
    "formally speaking , the hierarchy heavy - superheavy depends in a delicate way on the choice of an idempotent in the quantum homology ring of @xmath12 .",
    "this and other nuances will be ignored in this outline .",
    "the key properties of these collections are as follows ( see theorems  [ thm - intro - heavy ] and [ thm - products ] below ) :    * :* both collections are invariant under the group of all symplectomorphisms of @xmath12 .",
    "* :* every heavy subset is stably non - displaceable .    *",
    ":* every superheavy subset intersects every heavy subset .",
    "in particular , superheavy subsets are strongly non - displaceable .",
    "in contrast to this , heavy subsets can be mutually disjoint and strongly displaceable .",
    "* :* product of any two ( super)heavy subsets is ( super)heavy .    * * the collections of heavy and superheavy sets include the following examples :    stable stems : let @xmath13 be a finite - dimensional poisson - commutative subspace ( i.e. any two functions from @xmath14 commute with respect to the poisson brackets ) .",
    "let @xmath15 be the moment map : @xmath16 .",
    "a non - empty fiber @xmath17 , @xmath18 , is called a _ stem _ of @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) if all non - empty fibers @xmath19 with @xmath20 are displaceable and a _ stable stem _ if they are stably displaceable .",
    "if a subset of @xmath12 is a ( stable ) stem of a finite - dimensional poisson - commutative subspace of @xmath21 , it will be called just _ a ( stable ) stem_. clearly , any stem is a stable stem . *",
    "the collection of superheavy subsets includes all stable stems * ( see theorem  [ thm - stem ] below ) .",
    "one readily shows that a direct product of stable stems is a stable stem and that the image of a stable stem under _ any _ symplectomorphism is again a stable stem .",
    "the following example of a stable stem is borrowed ( with a minor modification ) from @xcite : let @xmath22 be a closed subset whose complement is a finite disjoint union of stably displaceable sets .",
    "then @xmath4 is a stable stem .",
    "for instance , the codimension-1 skeleton of a sufficiently fine triangulation of any closed symplectic manifold is a stable stem .",
    "another example is given by the equator of @xmath23 : it divides the sphere into two displaceable open discs and hence is a stable stem . by taking products",
    ", one can get more sophisticated examples of stable stems .",
    "already the product of equators of the two - spheres gives rise to a lagrangian clifford torus in @xmath24 .",
    "to prove its rigidity properties ( such as stable non - displaceability ) one has to use non - trivial symplectic tools such as lagrangian floer homology , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "products of the 1-skeletons of fine triangulations of the two - spheres can be considered as _ singular lagrangian submanifolds _ , an object which is currently out of reach of the lagrangian floer theory .",
    "another example of stable stems comes from hamiltonian torus actions .",
    "consider an effective hamiltonian action @xmath25 with the moment map @xmath26 .",
    "assume that @xmath27 is a normalized hamiltonian , that is @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "a torus action is called _ compressible _ if the image of the homomorphism @xmath30 , induced by the action @xmath31 , is a finite group",
    ". one can show that for compressible actions the fiber @xmath32 is a stable stem ( see theorem  [ thm - stab - disp ] below ) .",
    "special fibers of hamiltonian torus actions : consider an effective hamiltonian torus action @xmath31 on a spherically monotone symplectic manifold . let @xmath33 be the mixed action - maslov homomorphism introduced in @xcite . since the target space @xmath34 of the moment map @xmath35 is naturally identified with @xmath36 , the pull back @xmath37 of the mixed action - maslov homomorphism with the reversed sign can be considered as a point of @xmath34 . the preimage @xmath38 is called _ the special fiber _ of the action .",
    "we shall see below that the special fiber is always non - empty . for monotone",
    "symplectic toric manifolds ( that is when @xmath39 ) the special fiber is a monotone lagrangian torus .",
    "note that when the action is compressible we have @xmath40 and therefore the special fiber is a stable stem according to the previous example .",
    "it is unknown whether the latter property persists for general non - compressible actions .",
    "thus in what follows we treat stable stems and special fibers as separate examples . *",
    "the collection of superheavy subsets includes all special fibers * ( see theorem  [ thm - main - nondispl - toric ] below ) .    for instance , consider @xmath41 and the lagrangian clifford torus in it ( i.e. the torus @xmath42\\in { { \\mathbb{c}}}p^2\\ |\\ |z_0| =    @xmath43-action on @xmath41 preserving the clifford torus .",
    "it has three global fixed points away from the clifford torus .",
    "make an equivariant symplectic blow - up , @xmath12 , of @xmath41 at @xmath44 of these fixed points , @xmath45 , so that the obtained symplectic manifold is spherically monotone .",
    "the torus action lifts to a hamiltonian action on @xmath12 .",
    "one can show that its special fiber is the proper transform of the clifford torus .",
    "monotone lagrangian submanifolds : let @xmath46 be a spherically monotone symplectic manifold , and let @xmath47 be a closed monotone lagrangian submanifold with the minimal maslov number @xmath48 .",
    "we say that @xmath49 _ satisfies the albers condition _ @xcite",
    "if the image of the natural morphism @xmath50 contains a non - zero element @xmath51 with @xmath52    * the collection of heavy sets includes all closed monotone lagrangian submanifolds satisfying the albers condition * ( see theorem  [ thm - albers - elem - implies - heavy ] below ) .",
    "specific examples include the meridian on @xmath43 , @xmath53 and all lagrangian spheres in complex projective hypersurfaces of degree @xmath54 in @xmath55 with @xmath56 . in the case",
    "when the fundamental class @xmath57 $ ] of @xmath49 divides a non - trivial idempotent in the quantum homology algebra of @xmath12 , @xmath49 is , in fact , superheavy ( see theorem  [ thm - monot - superh ] below ) .",
    "for instance , this is the case for @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , a version of superheaviness holds for any lagrangian sphere in the complex quadric of even ( complex ) dimension .",
    "however , there exist examples of heavy , but not superheavy , lagrangian submanifolds : for instance , the meridian of the 2-torus is strongly displaceable by a ( non - hamiltonian ! ) shift and hence is not superheavy .",
    "another example of heavy but not superheavy lagrangian submanifold is the sphere arising as the real part of the fermat hypersurface @xmath59 with even @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we refer to section  [ subsec - mon - lagr ] for more details on ( super)heavy monotone lagrangian submanifolds .    * :* our motivation for the selection of examples appearing in the list above is as follows .",
    "stable stems provide a playground for studying symplectic rigidity of singular subsets .",
    "in particular , no visible analogue of the conventional lagrangian floer homology technique is applicable to them .",
    "detecting ( stable ) non - displaceability of lagrangian submanifolds via lagrangian floer homology is one of the central themes of symplectic topology .",
    "in contrast to this , detecting _ strong _ non - displaceabilty has at the moment the status of art rather than science .",
    "that s why we were intrigued by albers observation that monotone lagrangian submanifolds satisfying his condition are in some situations strongly non - displaceable . in the present work we tried to digest albers results @xcite and",
    "look at them from the viewpoint of theory of partial symplectic quasi - states developed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , our result on superheaviness of the lagrangian anti - diagonal in @xmath62 allows us to detect an  exotic \" monotone lagrangian torus in this symplectic manifold : this torus does not intersect the anti - diagonal , and hence is not heavy in contrast to the standard clifford torus , see example  [ exam - exotic - torus ] below .",
    "in @xcite we proved a theorem which roughly speaking states that every ( singular ) coisotropic foliation has at least one non - displaceable fiber .",
    "however , our proof is non - constructive and does not tell us which specific fibers are non - displaceable .",
    "the notion of the special fiber arose as an attempt to solve this problem for hamiltonian circle actions .",
    "let us mention also that the * product property * enables us to produce even more examples of ( super)heavy subsets by taking products of the subsets appearing in the list .",
    "a few comments on the methods involved into our study of heavy and superheavy subsets are in order .",
    "these collections are defined in terms of partial symplectic quasi - states which were introduced in @xcite .",
    "these are certain real - valued functionals on @xmath21 with rich algebraic properties which are constructed by means of the hamiltonian floer theory and which conveniently encode a part of the information contained in this theory . in general",
    ", the definition of a partial symplectic quasi - state involves the choice of an _ idempotent element _ in the commutative part @xmath63 of the quantum homology algebra of @xmath12 . though the default choice is just the unity of the algebra ,",
    "there exist some other meaningful choices , in particular in the case when @xmath64 is semi - simple .",
    "this gives rise to another theme discussed in this paper : ",
    "visible \" topological obstructions to semi - simplicity ( see corollary  [ cor - semisimple - torelli ] and theorem [ thm - lagr - semismp - a ] below ) . for instance , we shall show that if a monotone symplectic manifold @xmath12 contains  too many \" disjoint monotone lagrangian spheres whose minimal maslov numbers exceed @xmath65 , the quantum homology @xmath64 can not be semi - simple .",
    "let us pass to the precise set - up .",
    "for the reader s convenience , the material presented in this brief outline will be repeated in parts in the next sections in a less compressed form .      the novikov ring : let @xmath66 denote a base field which in our case will be either @xmath67 or @xmath68 , and let @xmath69 be a countable subgroup ( with respect to the addition ) .",
