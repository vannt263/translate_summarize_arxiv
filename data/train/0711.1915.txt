    "the study of properties of disordered complex systems with spatial and/or temporal correlations is one of the hot topics in modern physics .",
    "recently , much attention was paid to the related problem of how to construct disordered materials with specific transport properties that are due to underlying correlations in a disorder .",
    "one of the important applications of this problem is a creation of electron nano - devices , optic fibers , rough surfaces , acoustic and electromagnetic waveguides with selective transport properties .",
    "it is known ( see , for instance , @xcite ) that many of properties of systems with weak disorder are determined by the binary ( pair or two - point ) correlation function of a corresponding random process .",
    "recently it was found @xcite that specific long - range correlations in disordered potentials can lead to anomalous transport properties . to date",
    ", there exist a number of algorithms for generating long - range correlated sequences with prescribed correlations . among such algorithms",
    "the most widespread one is the _ convolution method _  @xcite . in this method",
    "random elements in the generated chain can be of any value from @xmath0 to @xmath1",
    ". however , in many applications it is more convenient to construct the sequences with finite number of random values .",
    "an important example of such system , being occurred in nature , is a sequence of nucleotides in a dna molecule , consisting of four elements only .",
    "the simplest case of a random sequence of finite elements is a stochastic _ dichotomic _ ( binary ) chain of only two elements .",
    "in contrast with the case of sequences of continuous elements , the problem of a construction of binary sequences with given correlation properties turns out to be tricky .",
    "as was recently shown in ref.@xcite , there is a serious restriction on the type of pair correlators in binary sequences , in contrast with the sequences with continuous distribution of their elements .",
    "many of related results for binary sequences can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "a direct way to create dichotomic correlated sequences is to apply the signum function to the sequence of continuous values , obtained with the convolution method .",
    "this method is based on the convolution of a white - noise sequence with some function that is determined by the desired pair correlator .",
    "however , as was numerically found in @xcite , the created binary sequence turns out to have the pair correlator different from the expected one . to date",
    ", it remains unclear how to construct binary sequences having the same pair correlators as in the sequences with continuous values of their elements . in spite of its quite simple form ,",
    "the signum function method is not rigorously analyzed in the literature .",
    "the present paper makes an effort to clarify this problem .",
    "our aim is to understand under what conditions the discussed method allows to construct binary sequences with a desired pair correlator .",
    "we perform a detailed theoretical analysis of the restrictions arising for binary sequences with long - range correlations .",
    "main attention is paid to the step - wise power spectrum resulting in a power decay of correlations .",
    "this type of correlations is extremely important in various applications , such as a creation of devices with selective transport properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to general properties of binary sequences .",
    "in particular , we derive some of the conditions restricting the form of pair correlators that a binary sequence can have . in section 3",
    "we describe in details the signum - generation method and derive basic relations needed for a further analysis . in next section 4",
    "we analyze the case of a balanced ( unbiased ) dichotomic sequence , i.e. , the sequence with the zero mean - value .",
    "here we also display the restrictions related to the discussed method .",
    "our main findings are reported in section 5 where we consider the most interesting case of long - range correlations with the step - wise spectrum . in section 6",
    "we ask a question about general restrictions appearing in the case of power decay of correlations for binary sequences . in last section",
    "we give some additional remarks concerning binary sequences , and summarize our results .",
    "the appendices contain some of details of analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "let us start with generic properties of dichotomic sequences , not associated with specific choice of a generation method . in view of constructing the sequences with a given pair correlator ,",
    "it is of great importance to know what are restrictions on the type of correlators allowed for dichotomic sequences . to shed light on this problem ,",
    "here we consider a statistically homogeneous random sequence of symbols @xmath2 consisting of the values @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 the canonical definition of the correlation function reads as follows @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mean value and variance of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "taking into account a peculiar property @xmath9 of our dichotomic sequence @xmath2 , one obtains @xmath10 it should be emphasized that the direct relation between the mean value and higher one - point moments is a specific property of _ any _ dichotomic chain .",
    "for instance , for the binary chain @xmath11 consisting of @xmath12 and @xmath4 we have the relation @xmath13 since @xmath14 in this case . on the contrary ,",
    "for a sequence of continuous random numbers of the gaussian type the variance and mean value are independent parameters .    to proceed with the two - point moments , we associate the correlator @xmath15 with the probabilities of two symbols with the same or opposite signs , occurring at the distance @xmath16 ,    [ pxy ] @xmath17 4p(\\pm1,\\underbrace{\\ldots}_{r-1},\\mp1)&=&1-\\overline{s}^2-c_s(r ) . \\label{p10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these relationships also are peculiar properties solely of dichotomic sequences , they are drastically distinct from the analogous relations for other random processes ( see , e.g. , eq .   for the two - point probability density of the gaussian process ) .",
