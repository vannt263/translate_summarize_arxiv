    "nuclear star clusters ( nsc ) are located at the centers of most spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "their study became possible via high spatial resolution observations from hst in the 1990s .",
    "they have properties similar to those of globular clusters although they are more compact , more massive and on average 4 mag brighter than the old globular clusters of the milky way @xcite .",
    "many nscs host an agn @xcite i.e. a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in their centers , have complex star formation histories @xcite and obey scaling - relations with host galaxy properties as do central smbhs @xcite .",
    "the study of nscs is of great interest because several of the most extreme physical phenomena occur within them such as smbhs , active galactic nuclei , star - bursts and extreme stellar densities .",
    "the galactic nsc is particularly interesting because of its proximity . at a distance of about 8kpc from earth",
    "it is the only nsc in which individual stars can be resolved .",
    "the center of the galactic nsc harbors a smbh @xcite .",
    "joint statistical analysis based on orbits around sgr a * @xcite , star counts and kinematic data gives @xmath8 and a statistical parallax @xmath9 kpc @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite have revealed that the nsc is flattened with an axial ratio @xmath10 , which is consistent with the kinematic data @xcite .",
    "observations of the nsc at optical - uv wavelengths are not feasible because of the high extinction @xmath11 mag due to interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "therefore we rely on the infrared , with average k - band extinction toward the central parsec close to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this is mostly foreground extinction ; however , it is very difficult observationally to measure the extinction variation along the line - of - sight within the nsc .    the area around sgr a * contains ionized gas which can be well described by a system of ionized streamers or filaments orbiting sgr a * @xcite that is also associated with hot dust @xcite .",
    "this complex structure of ionized gas is called the mini - spiral and consists of four main components : the northern arm , the eastern arm , the western arm and the bar @xcite , surrounded by the circumnuclear disk of inner radius @xmath13pc @xcite .    in our previous dynamical study of the nsc , an asymmetry in the @xmath1-proper motions",
    "was observed in the histograms which was attributed to dust causing stars on the far side of the nsc to fall out of the sample .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present estimates for the extinction within the nsc based on our dynamical model and see to what extent this is correlated with the mini - spiral , to try to understand the slight asymmetry in the @xmath1 velocity histograms of the nsc , and to check the impact of this on the fundamental parameters derived from the dynamical model such as the mass and the distance .    in section 2",
    "we discuss briefly our recent dynamical model of the nsc and describe qualitatively the effects of dust on the observed dynamics of the nsc . in section 3",
    "we show evidence based on the dynamics for the presence of dust within the nsc . in section 4",
    "we develop a method for making an analytical model for the dust extinction that can be used on top of an existing dynamical model .",
    "finally in section 5 we present extinction values for the dust within the nsc based on the prediction of the model in conjunction with the mini - spiral observations .",
    "in this section we give a brief description of the recent dynamical model of the nsc from @xcite ( section 2.1 ) and we show initial evidence for dust extinction within the nsc ( section 2.2 ) .      the dynamical model of the nsc described in @xcite is an axisymmetric model including flattening and rotation which is an excellent match to histograms of proper motions and line - of - sight velocities in many bins on the sky . for the density model we used a two - component spheroidal @xmath14-model @xcite which we fitted to the star count surface density data in ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) provided by @xcite .",
    "the inner rounder component can be considered as the nsc and the outer , more flattened component as the inner part of the nuclear stellar disk . using the density we applied axisymmetric jeans modeling in order to constrain the stellar mass @xmath17 , the black hole mass @xmath18 , and the distance @xmath19 of the nsc which we found to be @xmath20 for the nsc only , not including the constraints from stellar orbits around srg a*.    having this information we used the @xcite algorithm to calculate the even part of the 2-integral distribution function ( df ) @xmath21 .",
    "this allowed us to calculate the velocity profiles ( vp ) of the model .",
    "we found that the even part of the df can predict very well the characteristic 2-peak shape @xcite of the velocity histograms ( vh ) for the @xmath1 proper motion velocities , as well as the vhs in @xmath22 .",
    "the addition of a suitable odd part in @xmath23 to the even part of the df represents the rotation of the cluster , so that also the @xmath24 can be reproduced .      upon a closer look at the velocity histograms in @xmath15 direction @xmath25 ( see fig.[plot7 ] )",
    "it is noticeable that the right peak is often slightly higher than the left peak .",
    "seemingly there are more stars in the front of the cluster ( positive velocities ) than in the back .",
    "the proper motion data are from @xcite .",
    "they are given in galactic longitude @xmath26 and galactic latitude @xmath27 angles centered on sgr a*. in the following we always refer to the shifted coordinates but will omit the asterisks for simplicity .",
    "we assume that the rotation axis of the nsc is aligned with the rotation axis of the milky way disk .",
    "this is in accordance with the very symmetric spitzer surface density distribution of @xcite .",
    "coordinate system , a @xmath28 signifies an asymmetry in the @xmath1 vhs ( e.g. right peak higher ) a @xmath29 the opposite asymmetry and @xmath30 no asymmetry at all .",
    "only dust produces the same asymmetry in every quadrant .",
    "]    at least three effects could produce an asymmetry as in fig .",
    "[ plot7 ] .",
    "figure [ plot4 ] illustrates the effect of dust extinction without rotation , dust extinction with rotation , inclination and triaxiality on the vhs .",
    "each small square represents a quadrant of the shifted galactic coordinate system @xmath31 where sgr a * is at the center .",
    "a @xmath28 signifies an asymmetry ( e.g. right peak higher ) , a @xmath29 the opposite asymmetry , and @xmath30 no asymmetry at all ( both peaks same height ) .",
    "we will see in the following sections that dust with rotation produces the same asymmetry in every quadrant . because of the dust fewer stars will be visible at the back of the cluster , and because of the rotation the missing stars will be stars with negative velocities .",
    "inclination of the nsc produces opposite results for the upper and lower quadrants , because when the line - of - sight does not pass exactly through the center , it passes through areas of unequal density in front of and behind the nsc .",
    "finally , triaxiality produces opposite results for the right and left quadrants : consider a triaxial system with long axis in the galactic plane but rotated away from the line - of - sight to the observer , with a triaxially symmetric rotation field .",
    "if the stars at the front of the cluster lead to a higher peak for @xmath32 on the @xmath33 side , say , then by symmetry the opposite will be true on the @xmath34 side .",
    "therefore , if we symmetrize the data to one quadrant only , the effect of the dust will remain while the effects of the inclination and triaxiality will cancel out , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ plot4 ] .",
    "this is what we observe for the symmetrized data of the nsc ( fig .",
    "[ plot7 ] ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the observed asymmetry can not be a result of inclination and triaxiality but that it may be produced by dust extinction in conjunction with rotation .",
    "we note here that in order to observe this asymmetry ( right peak higher than left ) in the velocity profile in the @xmath15 direction @xmath35 , the dust should be _ inside _ the cluster ( i.e. within a few parsecs of the galactic center ) where the density is maximum , otherwise only a change in scale of the vps would take place .",
    "for the work reported in the following , we use photometric data in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 bands and proper motions for 7101 stars from @xcite .",
    "we split the data into a central and an extended field .",
    "the central field is a square centered on sgr a * with size of @xmath38 and contains 5847 stars .",
    "the rest of the stars belong to the extended fields , as shown in fig .",
    "[ plot2 ] .",
    "we obtain the extinction towards each star from the @xmath39 color ( stars without h photometry and early - type stars are excluded ) .",
    "we obtain intrinsic color estimates by assuming that the stars are at the distance of the galactic center and that they are giants , as it is the case for most stars in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic color varies between 0.065 and 0.34 but the majority of stars belong to a small magnitude range around the red clump . therefore and also because the extinction is high , the influence of intrinsic color uncertainties on the extinction is small compared to other effects , like photometric uncertainties .",
    "we use the extinction law of @xcite , implying @xmath40 .",
    "in this work we are mainly interested in the extinction variation @xmath41 _ within _ the galactic center .",
    "we obtain an estimate for that by measuring for each star the extinction relative to its neighbors , more specifically relative to the median extinction of its 15 closest neighbors .",
    "obvious foreground stars were already excluded in @xcite . by using 15 neighbors",
    "we obtain a robust median extinction estimate that is much less affected by extinction variations in the plane of the sky . to further reduce the influence of this extinction variation we exclude stars with too few close neighbors .",

    "this extinction value is very close to the value @xmath46 measured by @xcite .",

    "the average differential extinction of stars as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath22 velocities is an important photometric quantity that can also be modeled and gives us information about the dust within the nsc .",
    "[ plot8 ] shows this for the central field .",
    "we notice that the average differential extinction as a function of @xmath1 is negative for positive velocities ( preferentially at the front of the cluster ) and positive for negative velocities ( back of the cluster ) i.e. , stars at the front of the cluster are observed with less extinction than their neighbors .",
    "this finding is consistent with the asymmetry of the vhs in @xmath15 direction ( fig .",
    "[ plot7 ] ) and implies @xmath6 within the nsc , see below .",
    "in contrast the average differential extinction versus @xmath22 is relatively flat and consistent with the symmetric bell shape of the vh in @xmath16 direction .",
    "however we still notice a scatter of the points which is indicative of the systematic variations we should expect in @xmath5 .",

    "dark blue colour indicates insufficient signal - to - noise in the @xmath49 emission .",
    "the outline of the mini - spiral can be seen in this extinction map , and the variability of the dust extinction along the minispiral suggests that a fraction of this extinction is likely to be associated with the mini - spiral itself and therefore is located within the nsc .",

    "these considerations will motivate our choice of subfields for which we will construct separate dust models in section [ sec : predictions ] . for the development of the dust modeling in the next section",

    "the above means that to first order , dust does not affect the even part of the vpd in @xmath15 direction significantly except for a scale factor .",
    "fig [ vpdustnodust ] shows that the effects for @xmath145 and @xmath146 are similarly small . if extinction within a stellar system is small enough ( @xmath147 for the nsc ) then fitting the even part of a model s vps to the even part of the vhs is sufficient to get accurate estimates of the @xmath107 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 parameters . in @xcite",
    "we used the root mean square velocities that are moments of the even parts of the vhs to fit the @xmath107 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 parameters of the axisymmetric model .",
    "therefore we expect that their values will not be affected by dust more than @xmath148 as we explained earlier .    in principle",
    "the odd part of the @xmath144 can be fitted to the odd part of the vhs and this part is scale free since the scaling factor is already known from the even part therefore one can fit the @xmath70 for some combination of cells .",
    "the main goal of this work was to understand the slight asymmetries in the @xmath78s of the nsc and their influence on the dynamical modeling following the recent work of @xcite .",
    "our interest was triggered by the observation that the right peak of the @xmath96 is often slightly higher than the left .",
    "a plausible explanation was given based on the existence of dust _ within _ the nsc . because of the dust , the apparent number of stars behind the nsc is smaller than that in front of the cluster .",

    ", we worked with proper motions and photometry for @xmath149 stars from @xcite .",
    "we applied an analytic dust extinction model together with our recent nsc dynamical model .",
    "the extinction model gave us reasonable results and was able to predict both the signature in the vps and the photometry .",
    "observation of the nsc in the optical is almost impossible because of @xmath150 mag extinction . in the infrared the situation",
    "is much better since @xmath151 mag .",
    "most of this extinction belongs to the foreground and does not affect the shape of the vhs ( except a normalization factor ) .",
    "we find here that a small fraction of the total extinction value @xmath152 belongs within the nsc .",
    "the area between @xmath153pc radius consists of several streamers of dust , ionized and atomic gas with temperatures between @xmath154 and is called `` ionized central cavity '' @xcite .",
    "the mini - spiral is a feature of the ionized cavity , and is formed from several streamers of gas and dust infalling from the inner part of the cnd @xcite .",
    "it consists of four main components : the northern arm , the eastern arm , the western arm and the bar @xcite that can be described well by streams of ionized gas or filaments orbiting sgr a * @xcite .",
    "we investigated how well the mini - spiral correlates with the extinction effects in the nsc data within the central field . to assess this we first investigated whether our extinction model puts the dust on the same side of the nsc as does the mini - spiral interpretation .",
    "this is true for six out of the eight cells ( except cell c2 ) .",
    "we found the largest extinction @xmath155 in cell b where also the largest extinction is inferred from the extinction map of @xcite , and particularly low extinction in cell a where the extinction map is consistent with only foreground extinction .",
    "we can estimate the mass that corresponds to a given amount of extinction using @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the dust density , @xmath158 @xcite is the mass extinction coefficient for the k - band , @xmath159 from the model prediction and @xmath160 is the width of the dust screen .",
    "we find that @xmath161 and the dust mass within a parallelepiped with dimensions @xmath162 centered on sgr a * is @xmath163 .",
    "since the dust extinction model presented here is not precise we consider that this estimate is correct only within an order of magnitude .",
    "this value is within the range of @xmath164 for the mini - spiral found from other works @xcite .",
    "finally we showed that for small values of extinction the even parts of the vps are not affected significantly . as a result ,",
    "the measured @xmath107 and @xmath17 parameters of @xcite do not change by more than @xmath165 for extinction @xmath6 and the inferred @xmath19 is decreased by the same amount , which is less than the smallest systematic error ( for the statistical parallax ) inferred for these parameters in @xcite .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * we showed that extinction due to dust explains kinematic asymmetries and differential photometry of the nsc , and measured the amount of extinction within the nsc by combining a dynamical model with a dust extinction model .",
    "* we presented an extinction table for the dust _ within _ the nsc in several cells .",
