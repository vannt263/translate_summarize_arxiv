    "<S> we study the effect of antiferromagnetic longitudinal coupling on the one - dimensional transverse field ising model with nearest - neighbour couplings . in the topological phase where , in the thermodynamic limit , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is twofold degenerate , we show that , for a finite system of @xmath0 sites , the longitudinal coupling induces @xmath0 level crossings between the two lowest lying states as a function of the field . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide strong arguments suggesting that these @xmath0 level crossings all appear simultaneously as soon as the longitudinal coupling is switched on . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is based on perturbation theory , and a mapping of the problem onto the open kitaev chain , for which we write down the complete solution in terms of majorana fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> the topological properties of matter are currently attracting a considerable attention  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the hallmarks of a topologically non trivial phase is the presence of surface states . in one dimension , </S>",
    "<S> the first example was the spin-1 chain that was shown a long time ago to have a gapped phase  @xcite with two quasi - degenerate low - lying states ( a singlet and a triplet ) on open chains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these low - lying states are due to the emergent spin-1/2 degrees of freedom at the edges of the chains which combine to make a singlet ground state with an almost degenerate low - lying triplet for an even number of sites , and a triplet ground state with an almost degenerate low - lying singlet when the number of sites is odd . in that system , the emergent degrees of freedom are magnetic since they carry a spin 1/2 , and they can be detected by standard probes sensitive to local magnetisation such as nmr  @xcite .    in fermionic systems , </S>",
    "<S> a topological phase is present if the model includes a pairing term ( as in the mean - field treatment of a p - wave superconductor ) , and the emergent degrees of freedom are two majorana fermions localised at the opposite edges of the chain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their detection is much less easy than that of magnetic edge states , and it relies on indirect consequences such as their impact on the local tunneling density of states  @xcite , or the presence of two quasi - degenerate low - lying states in open systems . in that respect , it has been suggested to look for situations where the low - lying states cross as a function of an external parameter , for instance the chemical potential , to prove that there are indeed two low - lying states  @xcite .    in a recent experiment with chains of cobalt atoms evaporated onto a cu@xmath1n / cu(100 ) substrate  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of level crossings as a function of the external magnetic field has been revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy , which exhibits a specific signature whenever the ground state is degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant effective model for that system is a spin-1/2 xy model in an in - plane magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the exact diagonalisation of finite xy chains has indeed revealed the presence of quasi - degeneracy between the two lowest energy states , that are well separated from the rest of the spectrum , and a series of level crossings between them as a function of the magnetic field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the position of these level crossings is in good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that these level crossings are analogous to those predicted in topological fermionic spin chains , and that they can be interpreted as a consequence of the majorana edge modes  @xcite .    the topological phase of the xy model in an in - plane magnetic field is adiabatically connected to that of the transverse field ising model , in which the longitudinal spin - spin coupling ( along the field ) is switched off . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the transverse field ising model , the two low - lying states never cross as a function of the field , as can be seen from the magnetisation curve calculated by pfeuty a long time ago  @xcite , and which does not show any anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> the very different behaviour of the xy model in an in - plane field in that respect calls for an explanation . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the present paper is to provide such an explanation , and to show that the presence of @xmath0 level crossings , on a chain of @xmath0 sites , is generic as soon as an antiferromagnetic longitudinal coupling is switched on . to achieve this goal , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied a hamiltonian which interpolates between the exactly solvable transverse field ising ( tfi ) and the longitudinal field ising ( lfi ) chains . </S>",
    "<S> the approach that best accounts for these level crossings turns out to be an approximate mapping onto the exactly solvable kitaev chain , which contains all the relevant physics . in the majorana representation , the level crossings are due to the interaction between majorana fermions localised at each end of the chain .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we present the model and give some exact diagonalisation results on small chains to get an intuition of the qualitative behaviour of the spectrum . we show in section [ sec : pt ] that perturbation theory works in principle but is rather limited because of the difficulty to go to high order . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn to an approximate mapping onto the open kitaev chain via a mean - field decoupling in section [ sec : mf ] . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this paper is presented in section [ sec : maj ] , namely the explanation of the level crossings in a majorana representation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we conclude with a a quick discussion of some possible experimental realisations in section [ sec : exp ] . </S>"
