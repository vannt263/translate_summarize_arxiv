    "optical clocks , with natural linewidth at the millihertz level , have demonstrated great improvements in stability and accuracy over the microwave frequency standards .",
    "the research on optical atomic clocks have achieved remarkable progress in the past several years especially in single - ion optical clocks . all - optical atomic clock referenced to the 1.064 petahertz transition of a single trapped @xmath2hg@xmath1 ion",
    "has been realized in 2001  @xcite .",
    "two al@xmath1 ion optical clocks , operated at @xmath3s@xmath4 to @xmath5p@xmath4 clock transition with frequency near 1.121 petahertz and narrow natural linewidth of 8 mhz , have been constructed with fractional frequency inaccuracy of the order of magnitude @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "although these single - ion optical clocks have reached unprecedented stability and accuracy , there are still some problems to be solved .",
    "the observed linewidth of the clock transition is limited by the linewidth of the probe laser  @xcite .",
    "thus , narrow linewidth laser light source becomes the key factor of the performance of single - ion optical clocks .",
    "since the proposal of active optical clock  @xcite , a number of neutral atoms with two - level , three - level and four - level at thermal , laser cooling and trapping configurations have been investigated recently  @xcite .",
    "the potential quantum - limited linewidth of active optical clock is narrower than mhz , and it is possible to reach this unprecedented linewidth since the thermal noise of cavity mode can be reduced dramatically with the mechanism of active optical clock  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a laser light source based on active ion optical clock will be favorable to single - ion optical clocks .",
    "one candidate is @xmath0yb@xmath1 ion . with about @xmath7 @xmath0yb@xmath1 ions in a paul trap  @xcite ,",
    "the population inversion can be realized as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the cooling laser and repumping laser at @xmath8s@xmath9 to @xmath8p@xmath10 and @xmath8s@xmath10 to @xmath8p@xmath9 transitions are used as pumping laser .",
    "first , during the cycling @xmath11 to @xmath12 transition , there is a branching probability of @xmath13 for ions decaying to @xmath8d@xmath14 sublevel  @xcite .",
    "second , when the ions that leaked to @xmath8s@xmath10 are repumped to @xmath8p@xmath9 , ions will decay to @xmath8d@xmath15 sublevels .",
    "then the population inversion is established between @xmath8d@xmath14 and @xmath8s@xmath10 sublevels .",
    "the ions at @xmath8d@xmath16 can be repumped with a 935 nm laser at transition from @xmath8d@xmath16 to @xmath5d[3/2]@xmath9 and then decay to @xmath8s@xmath9 by spontaneous transition very quickly .",
    "so this channel can be ignored when calculating the energy level population .",
    "small leakage channels to other sublevels can be closed with additional repumping lasers if necessary .",
    "the calculations of dynamical process of population inversion of @xmath0yb@xmath1 ions in a paul trap and lasing process with a fabry - perot type resonator are presented in detail .",
    "we calculated the quantum - limited linewidth of active @xmath0yb@xmath1 ion optical clock and got it should be narrower than 1 mhz .",
    "other proper candidate ions for active optical clock and ion laser are also discussed and compared with @xmath0yb@xmath1 in this paper .",
    "considering the spontaneous decay rate of @xmath8p@xmath17 is @xmath18 mhz , it is reasonable to set the pumping rate  @xcite from @xmath8s@xmath9 to @xmath8p@xmath10 @xmath19 .",
    "so the decay rate to @xmath8d@xmath14 sublevel is @xmath20 .",
    "then we can set the repumping rate of @xmath8s@xmath10 to @xmath8p@xmath9 transition @xmath21 to be of the order of magnitude @xmath22 and the repumping rate of @xmath8d@xmath16 to @xmath5d[3/2]@xmath9 sublevel to be @xmath23 .",
    "the effective power is reduced to one third if only the 0 - 0 clock transition is effective . in order to depopulate ions at @xmath8d@xmath14 ( @xmath24 ) zeeman sublevels , each transition from these two zeeman sublevels @xmath8d@xmath14 ( @xmath24 ) to @xmath8s@xmath10 is also coupled with one mode of ion laser cavity .",
    "based on the assumption that the ions have been trapped in a paul trap , and the theories of the interaction between the ions and light , the density matrix equations for @xmath0yb@xmath1 ions interacted with the cooling light and the repumping light can be written in rwa - approximation as follows : @xmath25    the subscript numbers of the density matrix correspond to different energy levels as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the diagonal elements mean the number of ions in corresponding states and off - diagonal elements mean coherence between two states .",
    "the rabi frequency is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the electric dipole matrix between the @xmath8s@xmath9 state and @xmath8p@xmath10 state , @xmath28 is the electric strength of the cooling light .",
    "@xmath29 , with the electric dipole matrix @xmath30 between the @xmath8s@xmath10 state and @xmath8p@xmath9 state and the electric strength @xmath31 of the repumping light .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are frequency detunings of cooling and repumping light on the transition frequencies .",
    "they are both set to be 0 .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are decaying rates related to the lifetimes of the corresponding energy levels described in fig .  1 .",

    "are both 0 . the effective decay rate of the channel , from 6p @xmath8p@xmath17 to 5d @xmath8d@xmath47 then repumped with 935 nm laser to @xmath5d[3/2]@xmath9 and decay to @xmath8s@xmath17 by spontaneous transition , is ignored in calculations since it is much smaller than @xmath34 .",

    "@xmath51.,width=283 ]    without the cavity , the numerical solution results for the above equations are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "assuming there are @xmath52 ions in the paul trap and a quarter of them are in the @xmath8s@xmath10 state at the beginning , the population inversion between @xmath8d@xmath14 and @xmath8s@xmath10 states is built up at the time scale of @xmath53s . from fig .",
    "2 , it is obvious that under the action of cooling laser , the number of ions in the @xmath8s@xmath9 state decrease rapidly .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath8p@xmath10 and @xmath8p@xmath9 states are much shorter than that of @xmath8d@xmath14 state , so ions accumulate in @xmath8d@xmath14 state and the population inversion is built up .",
    "if we keep other conditions unchanged , the number of ions at the steady - state in @xmath8d@xmath14 sublevel is 10 times as much as that in @xmath8s@xmath10 sublevel for @xmath54 , and 20 times for @xmath55 .    an optical resonant bad cavity",
    ", whose linewidth of cavity mode is much wider than the linewidth of gain , could be applied to the lasing transition between the inverted states @xmath8d@xmath14 and @xmath8s@xmath10 , as the population inversion occurs .",
    "the oscillating process could start up once the optical gain exceeds the loss rate .",
    "the corresponding density matrix equations together with the equations of emitted photons(@xmath42 ) from the total ions(@xmath56 ) inside the cavity can be written as above .",
    "we use a fabry - perot resonator with mode volume about @xmath57 and the cavity loss rate @xmath58 khz .",
    "the laser emission coefficient is @xmath59 .",
    "3 describes the solution of the photon number equation . from fig .",
    "3 we can conclude that a stable laser field has been built up within laser cavity on condition that the population inversion is preserved .",
    "the steady - state value of photon number @xmath42 is 160 and the power of this @xmath0yb@xmath1 ion laser lasing from @xmath8d@xmath14 to @xmath8s@xmath10 is about 37pw .    .",
    "there are @xmath52 ions in the cavity .",

    "we consider the effect of @xmath21 .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath21 will increase the population inversion , thus increasing the probability of lasing transition between the inverted states .",
    "the steady - state value of photon number for @xmath55 is larger than that of @xmath54 in the case of the same total ions number(see fig .  4 ) .",
    "given @xmath55 , the largest value of @xmath21 we can get under general experimental condition , the steady - state value of photon number @xmath42 is 336 .",
    "the power of this @xmath0yb@xmath1 ion laser is about 77 pw .",
    "varies with the total ions number @xmath56 in the cavity .",
    "the red line is for @xmath54 , the blue line is for @xmath55.,width=283 ]    as the number of ions in the cavity increases , the steady - state value of photon number is expected to rise accordingly .",
    "the steady - state value of photon number @xmath42 varying with the total ions number @xmath56 in the cavity is also shown in fig .  4 . considering the actual experimental condition , we set the largest number of total ions in the cavity to be @xmath52 .",
    "compared with the traditional laser , the primary three conditions are fulfilled for the active optical frequency standards based on paul trap trapped ions just proposed in this paper .",
    "the very difference is that the lifetime of the lasing upper energy level is so long that the natural linewidth of the laser field is much narrower than the cavity mode linewidth , which is 500 khz .",
    "besides , the temperature of cold ions trapped in paul trap decreases the doppler broadening linewidth . therefore , active ion optical clock operating at the condition of bad cavity will be a very stable narrow - linewidth laser source since the cavity pulling effect will dramatically reduce the cavity length noise due to johnson thermal effect .",
    "it is suitable for single - ion optical frequency standards due to its higher stability .",
    "although conventional single - ion optical clocks have reached unprecedented stability and accuracy , the observed linewidth of the clock transition is limited by the linewidth of the probe laser  @xcite . active ion optical clock , as which we presented in this paper , can offer a new laser light source for single - ion optical clocks because of its narrow linewidth and high stability .",
    "after laser cooling , the @xmath61 hz natural linewidth clock transition between @xmath8s@xmath10 and @xmath8d@xmath14 states has been measured with a fourier - limited linewidth of 30 hz recently  @xcite .",
    "based on the mechanism of active optical clock  @xcite , to reduce the effect caused by the thermal noise of cavity , the ion laser cavity should be bad cavity , which means the linewidth of the cavity ( or the cavity loss rate ) should be much wider than the linewidth of the gain ( the broaden ion transition linewidth after considering the doppler broadening , collision broadening and light shift _ etc . _ ) . given the linewidth of ion gain to be 30 hz as measured , one can set the cavity mode linewidth as @xmath62 khz",
    ". then the cavity related noise is reduced by 4 orders of magnitude to below 1 mhz with the best cavity design .",
    "the ion - cavity coupling constant  @xcite can be set around @xmath63 hz .",
    "the quantum - limited linewidth of active ion optical clock  @xcite @xmath64 is narrower than 1 mhz .",
    "there are still some effects that will shift and broaden the linewidth of active ion optical clock , like light shift caused by the repumping laser .",
    "for @xmath0yb@xmath1 active ion optical clock , the largest light shift effect is caused by the repumping laser of @xmath8s@xmath10 to @xmath8p@xmath9 transition . by adjusting this repuming laser at red detuning to @xmath8p@xmath9",
    ", its light shift can be greatly reduced by suitable blue detuning to @xmath8p@xmath10 transition .",
    "the repumping laser can be stabilized to an uncertainty of @xmath65 hz .",
    "considering that the spontaneous decay rate of @xmath8p@xmath17 is @xmath18 mhz , far greater than 100 hz , we can write the light shift as @xmath66 . given the repumping rate @xmath55 , the value of light shift is 0.69 mhz .",
    "other ions such as ba@xmath1 , ca@xmath1 and sr@xmath1 are also potential candidates for active optical clock and narrow linewidth ion laser with the same mechanism .    compared with most clock transitions of traditional passive ion optical frequency standards , which are between @xmath8s@xmath17 and @xmath8d@xmath67 states like ba@xmath1 , ca@xmath1 and sr@xmath1",
    ", we recommend the lasing from @xmath8d@xmath68 to @xmath8s@xmath17 states for active optical clock and narrow linewidth ion laser . in this case , here taking the even isotopic @xmath69sr@xmath1 as an example , it can be a natural three - level laser configuration with the cooling laser used as repumping laser at the same time , thus simpler than traditional passive ion optical clock . during the 422 nm cooling procedure , ions spontaneously decay to @xmath8d@xmath68 state and accumulate at this state with 0.4s lifetime  @xcite",
    ". then , coupled with a bad cavity via stimulated emission , the ions transit from @xmath8d@xmath68 to @xmath8s@xmath17 state in the configuration of three - level ion laser . with a magnetic field along the cavity axis , the laser light will be circularly polarized .    in summary",
    ", we propose a scheme of active ion optical clock , i.e. narrow linewidth bad cavity ion laser with detailed pumping method , lasing states , output power , linewidth and light shift reduction .",
