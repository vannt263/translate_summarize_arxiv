    "a quantum computer is a device which uses peculiar quantum effects , such as superposition and entanglement , to process information @xcite .",
    "although current quantum computers operate on few quantum bits ( _ qubits _ ) @xcite , it is known that large - scale quantum devices can run certain algorithms exponentially faster than the classical or probabilistic counterpart @xcite .",
    "recently there has been many proposals to speed - up machine learning strategies using quantum devices @xcite .",
    "most of these proposals either use quantum algorithms to achieve faster learning @xcite or exploit quantum fluctuations to escape from local minima in training the boltzmann machine @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a different perspective . since the actual development of a general quantum computer is still in its infancy , rather than focusing on the advantages of quantum devices for machine learning",
    "we show how machine learning can help the construction of a quantum computer .    to keep the discussion realistic , we focus on a superconducting quantum computing architecture @xcite where each qubit is realized with a superconducting circuit cooled at low temperature .",
    "the pairwise coupling between two qubits is introduced by connecting them via a capacitor ( or an inductor ) whose strength can be tuned by design . given the flexibility in wiring the different qubits , it is then possible to build a quantum network with tunable couplings .    in the next sections we introduce basic aspects of the physical simulation of quantum operations to set up the formalism and then we propose our strategy which is inspired by supervised learning .      from the mathematical point of view",
    "each qubit is described by a two dimensional hilbert space @xmath0 , while the hilbert space of @xmath1 qubits is given the the tensor product @xmath2 .",
    "the possible quantum states , like the state @xmath3 for a classical 5-bit register , correspond to vectors of unit norm in the hilbert space .",
    "an arbitrary operation , namely a quantum _ gate _ , corresponds to a unitary matrix @xmath4 acting on @xmath5 . in more physical terms",
    ", @xmath4 is the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the imaginary unit , @xmath8 represents time , and @xmath9 is the hamiltonian , a hermitian @xmath10 matrix which describes the physical interactions between the qubits . if the qubits are unmodulated , namely there is no external time - dependent control so @xmath9 is independent on @xmath8 , then after a certain time @xmath8 the operation on the qubits is given by @xmath11 , being @xmath12 the matrix exponential . in principle , for any given operation @xmath4 there are some corresponding interactions modeled by a hamiltonian @xmath9 so that @xmath11 . however , in physical implementations of quantum computers @xcite the range of possible hamiltonians is severely limited , thus drastically restricting the range of achievable quantum operations without external control .",
    "this problem is typically solved by switching on and off different interactions in time so the final operation is the product @xmath13 where @xmath14 , being @xmath15 a sequence of interaction hamiltonians , each one switched on for a time @xmath16 . as in classical computation , there is a minimal set of gates @xmath17 which enable _ universal _ quantum computation simply by concatenating at different times gates from this set @xcite . indeed , most quantum algorithms are nothing but a known sequence of universal operations .",
    "the implementation of this sequence however requires an outstanding experimental ability to perfectly switch on and off different physical couplings at given times .",
    "possible errors or imperfections in this sequential process accumulate in time and may affect the outcome , if not tacked with error correcting codes @xcite .    given this experimental difficulty , it is worth asking whether the unitary @xmath4 which results from a recurring sub - sequence of the algorithm can be implemented directly in _",
    "indeed in the next section we propose a different strategy which exploits auxiliary qubits to implement quantum operations with physical interactions and no external control .",
    "this strategy could potentially allow an experimentalist to create a quantum device which , by simply `` waiting '' for the natural dynamics of the network , is able to implement transformations like the quantum fourier transform which are ubiquitous in quantum algorithms , and may even provide an alternative paradigm for general quantum computation .",
    "our method shares similar goals with a recent proposal by childs @xcite , but it is completely different because it uses weighted networks which allow us to significantly lower the number ancillary qubits required for the operation .",
    "our aim is to implement a quantum operation ( a unitary matrix @xmath4 ) on a @xmath1 qubit register exploiting the physical interactions available for that hardware architecture , and avoiding to use external control fields .",
    "since a generic @xmath18 gate @xmath4 is impossible to realize with @xmath1 qubits and pairwise interactions only , as described before , we consider a larger network of @xmath19 qubits and we engineer the strength of the pairwise interactions between them to implement the operation , when possible .",
    "this problem shares some similarities with supervised learning in artificial neural networks although , as we clarify in the following , is also very different in some aspects . in supervised learning , given a training set @xmath20",
    "the goal is the find a functional approximation @xmath21 which is also able to predict the output corresponding to unknown inputs missing from the training set .",
    "even when there is no prior knowledge of @xmath22 , it is possible to approximate the input / output relations with a neural network composed by input , output and hidden layers @xcite .",
    "the learning procedure then consists in finding the optimal weights between nodes of different layers such that the desired input / output relation is reconstructed .",
    "is implemented only on the register qubits .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    on the other hand , in our problem the functional relation between inputs and outputs , namely the gate @xmath4 is already known in advance .",
    "however , the corresponding hamiltonian may contain simultaneous interactions between @xmath23 or more qubits which unlikely appear in physical implementations . to simulate @xmath4 using pairwise interactions only",
    ", we consider then a larger network as in fig .",
    "[ fig : qnet ] with ancillary qubits playing the role of the hidden layers , and we train the weights , namely the physical couplings , such that the dynamics of the network reproduces @xmath4 in a given subset of qubits . to simplify the implementation",
    "we assume that the input and output registers are made of the same physical qubits , although this assumption may be removed . in the next section",
    "we show how to formally model the training procedure .",
    "in supervised learning the training set is composed of data , whose input to output map @xmath22 is not known . on the other hand , we know the gate @xmath4 and we want find find the physical couplings , i.e. the weights of the network in fig .   [",
    "fig : qnet ] , such that the quantum network evolution implements @xmath4 in the register .",
    "because of this difference we named our strategy `` teaching '' rather than learning . in our case we can build an arbitrary large training set by choosing random input states refers to a normalized vector . ] @xmath24 and finding the corresponding output states @xmath25 , so the generated @xmath26-dimensional ( @xmath26 being variable ) training set is @xmath27 in principle the optimal inputs may depend on the target gate @xmath4 .",
    "however , for simplicity and generality , in each @xmath28 is sampled from the haar measure @xcite .",
    "the quality of the implementation of the target gate @xmath4 into the dynamics of the quantum network can be measured by defining a _",
    "cost _ function which , for any input state @xmath29 , measures the distance between the output state of the evolution and the expected output @xmath30 . the similarity between two quantum states @xmath31 and @xmath32 is measured by the fidelity corresponds to the hermitian conjugate @xmath33 so @xmath34 is the inner product between the vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ] @xmath35 .",
    "because of the cauchy - schwarz inequality , it is @xmath36 and the upper value @xmath37 is obtained only when @xmath38 .",
    "however , because of entanglement between the register and the ancillary qubits the state of the register is not exactly known , but it can be in different states @xmath39 with probability @xmath40 .",
    "such a _ mixed _ state is mathematically described by the matrix @xcite @xmath41 and the fidelity between @xmath42 and @xmath43 becomes @xmath44 .",
    "given an initial state @xmath31 let us call @xmath45 $ ] the state of the register after the evolution generated by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath46 which depends on the weights @xmath47 .",
    "this state can be constructed by ( i ) initializing the @xmath1 register qubits in the state @xmath31 ; ( ii ) setting the remaining @xmath48 ancillary qubits in a ( fixed ) state @xmath49 ; ( iii ) switching on the evolution described by @xmath46 for a certain time @xmath8  without loss of generality we set @xmath50 , since @xmath51 ; ( iv ) observing the state of the register .",
    "step ( iii ) gives the state @xmath52 .",
    "while step ( iv ) produces a mixed state since the dynamics of a reduced system is obtained with the _ partial trace _",
    "@xcite , so @xmath53 = { \\rm tr}_{\\rm ancilla } { \\left|{\\eta_t}\\right\\rangle}{\\langle{\\eta_t}|}$ ] . ] .",
    "the goal is then to find the optimal weights @xmath47 ( if they exist ) such that the state @xmath54 $ ] is equal to the target state @xmath30 for each @xmath29 .",
    "mathematically this corresponds to the maximization of the average fidelity @xmath55    u{\\left|{\\psi_j}\\right\\rangle}~.    \\label{fidelity}\\ ] ] the function @xmath56 measures on average how the dynamics of the network reproduces in the register the target quantum gate @xmath4 .",
    "it is non - convex in general and may have many local maxima with @xmath57 .",
    "however , an optimal configuration @xmath58 is interesting for practical purposes only if the error @xmath59 is smaller than the desired threshold @xcite ( say @xmath60 ",
    "@xmath61 ) , so in the following we say that a solution exists if an optimal @xmath58 is found with @xmath62 . there are no known theoretical tools to establish in advance whether this high - fidelity solution @xmath58 can exist , so one has to rely on numerical methods . in the next section",
    "we discuss a simple algorithm for finding @xmath58 .",
    "the explicit form of the fidelity function ( @xmath63 is a cost function ) as a sum over the training set allows us to use the stochastic gradient descent training algorithm , which is widely used for in training artificial neural networks within the backpropagation algorithm . however , since our training set is variable and can be sampled from the haar distribution of pure states we propose an adapted version of the stochastic gradient descent with online training :    choose the initial weights @xmath47 ( e.g. at random ) ; choose an initial learning rate @xmath64 ; generate a random @xmath31 from the haar measure ; update the weights as @xmath65u{\\left|{\\psi}\\right\\rangle } ;      \\label{e.grad }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] decrease @xmath64 ( see below ) ;    in the above algorithm , the weights are updated @xmath66 times before changing the state . the parameter @xmath66 defines the amount of deterministic steps in the learning procedure and it can be set to the minimum value @xmath67 , so that after each iteration the state is changed , or to higher values . on the other hand , the learning rate @xmath64 has to decrease @xcite in an optimal way to assure convergence , a common choice being @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the step counter . on physical grounds , as we discussed extensively in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stochastic fluctuations given by choosing random quantum states at different steps enable the training procedure to escape from local maxima when the weights are far from the optimal point @xmath58 .    using the above algorithm , in ref.@xcite we considered pairwise interactions described by physically reasonable hamiltonians and we found different quantum network configurations which implement different quantum operations , such as the quantum analogue of toffoli and fredkin gate .",
    "we are proposing an alternative strategy to the physical implementation of quantum operations which avoids time modulation and sophisticated control pulses .",
    "this strategy consists in enlarging the number of qubits and engineering the unmodulated pairwise interactions between them so that the desired operation is implemented into the register subset ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qnet ] ) by the natural physical evolution .",
    "inspired by the analogy with the training of artificial neural networks , we then propose a simple algorithm that is suitable for finding few - qubits networks which implement some important quantum gates . in the long term , by finding more efficient training algorithms suitable for larger spaces , our strategy could potentially provide an alternative paradigm for computation where some quantum algorithms and/or many - qubit gates are obtained by simply `` waiting '' for the natural dynamics of a suitably designed network ."
