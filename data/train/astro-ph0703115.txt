    "the urc for the purpose of this work matches well the individual rcs of late type spirals ( see also appendix for a discussion ) .",
    "it is useful to express the urc paradigm in the following way : at any chosen radius , the urc predicts the circular velocity of a ( late type ) spiral of _ known _ luminosity and disk scale - length , within an error that is one order of magnitude smaller than the variations it shows i ) at different radii and ii ) at any radius , with respect to objects of different luminosity .",

    "although not all these urcs are independent in a statistical sense , they all are relevant in that they all well reproduce the individual rcs and each of them highlights particular properties of the mass distribution .    -0.2truecm",

    "3 we show @xmath94 , the urc in physical units with the objects identified by the halo virial mass ; each line refers to a given halo mass in the range @xmath95 ; the halo mass determines both the amplitude and the shape of the curve .",
    "note the contribution of the baryonic component , negligible for small masses but increasingly important in the larger structures , mirrors the behavior of the @xmath96 relation .",
    "the general existence of an inner peak is evident but , especially at low masses , it is due to both dark and stellar components .",
    "remarkably , the maximum value of the circular velocity occurs at about @xmath97  kpc , independent of the galaxy mass : this seems to be a main kinematic imprint of the dm - luminous mass interaction occurring in spirals .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "3 shows that the `` cosmic conspiracy '' paradigm has no observational support : there is no fine tuning between the dark and the stellar structural parameters to produce the same particular rc profile in all objects ( e.g. a flat one ) .",
    "conversely , a number of relationships between the various structural parameters produce a variety of rc profiles .",
    "moreover , the peak velocity of the stellar component @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , is not a constant fraction of the virial velocity as is found in ellipticals , ( i.e @xmath100 ) , but it ranges between the values @xmath101 and @xmath102 depending on the halo mass .",
    "moreover , as in the nfw ( and burkert ) rc profiles , the urc profiles are found ( moderately ) decreasing over most of the halo radial extent .",
    "the paradigm of flat rotation curves is obviously incorrect even / especially intended as an asymptotic behavior at large radii .",
    "in fact , we find that both @xmath103,the velocity at the farthest radius with available kinematical in pss and @xmath104 , a main reference velocity of the luminous regions of spirals , are significantly ( @xmath105 ) higher than the ( observational ) value of @xmath63 .",
    "this rules out a @xmath106 extrapolation of the inner rcs out to regions non mapped by the kinematics and dm dominated regions .",
    "we note that this result is independent of the adopted halo density profile and is far from being granted on theoretical grounds .    -.3truecm    -0.2truecm    -0.3truecm    in fig .  4 we frame the urc from a full dm perspective by plotting @xmath107 .",
    "we set the virial mass @xmath33 as the galaxy identifier and @xmath108 as the radial `` dark '' coordinate , thus normalizing the amplitudes by @xmath109 .",
    "this ensemble of curves , a main goal of the present work , is parallel to those emerging in @xmath1-body simulations and aims to represent the actual velocity profiles of spirals . in these variables",
    "the dm halos are self - similar ; the whole system is self - similar in the outer regions , while in the innermost @xmath110 of the halo size the baryons have influenced the dynamics and broken the self - similarity . in these coordinates it easily emerges that the maximum of the rc occurs at very different radii , viz . at @xmath111 for the most massive objects and at @xmath112 for the least massive ones .",
    "then , no reference circular velocities , to be considered as the actual physical counterparts of the empirical velocities of the tully - fisher relationship , exist in actual galaxy rotation curves .",
    "-0.5 truecm    0.2truecm    in fig .",
    "5 we zoom into the urc to look for the inner ( luminous ) regions of spirals from a baryonic perspective : the urc is so expressed as a function of the `` baryonic '' radial coordinate @xmath113 .",
    "this figure corresponds to fig .  4 of pss , with the important difference that here the virial mass , rather than the galaxy luminosity , is the galaxy identifier .",
    "plainly , an inverse correlation between the average steepness of the rc slope and the halo mass holds , similar to the slope - luminosity relationship found by persic & salucci ( 1988 ) . in this coordinate the stellar matter is closely self - similar , and the different shapes of the rc s curves are mainly due to the @xmath96 relation . in the space defined by normalized circular velocity - dark radius - halo mass , spirals do not occupy random positions , but a well defined plane of very small thickness .",
    "we clearly see that , by filling only less than @xmath114 of the available volume , the available kinematics of spiral galaxies defines the universal rotation curve .",
    "let us notice that , in principle , theories of the formation of spirals do not trivially imply the existence of such a surface that underlies the occurrence of a strong dark - luminous coupling .",

    "9b does not have solution .",
    "more specifically , let us constrain the analytical form of the outer dm distribution .",
    "for @xmath120 , the following approximation for the burkert and nfw profile holds ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) @xmath123 let us suppose that the actual _",
    "outer _ dm velocity _ profile _ is different from the burkert / nfw given by eq .  (",
    "11 ) , i.e. @xmath124 . then in fig 7 we show that , even assuming large uncertainties in @xmath63 , in order to match both @xmath86 and @xmath63 , we must have @xmath125 .",
    "this is a first direct support for the burkert and the nfw density law to be able to represent the outer regions ( @xmath126 ) of dm galaxy halos .",
    "notice that weak - lensing shear fields , at several hundreds kpc from the galaxy centers , are found _ compatible _ with the predictions of the nfw density profile , but can not exclude non - nfw profiles ( kleinheinrich .",
    ", et al . , 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper , we have built the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies by means of kinematical and photometric data .",
    "we physically extended the urc , established for the inner region of galaxies in pss out to @xmath34 and have been able to employ the virial mass @xmath33 as the parameter that characterizes spiral galaxies , and the virial radius @xmath34 as a unit of measure for the radial coordinate .",
    "this urc is meant to be the _ observational _ counterpart of the nfw rotation curve , emerging from cosmological simulations performed in the cdm scenario .",
    "the urc yields the gravitational potential at any radius and it allows to link the local properties in the inner luminous regions with the global properties of the dm halos .",
    "dm halos have one ( and likely just one ) characteristic length scale , @xmath127 , which it is not _ naturally _ present in current scenarios of galaxy formation .",

    "the main significance of the urc concerns the full mass distribution ( md ) .",
    "first , it is possible to immediately exclude the following scenarios ( and combinations of them ) : i ) individual behavior , every object has its own md ; ii ) unique behavior , every object has almost the same md . instead , the md in spirals shows a remarkable _ mass - dependent _ systematics : both the dark and the stellar matter are distributed according to _ profiles _ that are functions of the total mass @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "8) . finally , the dm halo becomes the dominant mass component in galaxies at different radii , according to the galaxy mass : from @xmath132 for the lowest masses , to @xmath133 for the highest ones .",

    "] furthermore , the urc paradigm implies : i ) rotation velocity slopes _ vs. _ rotation velocity amplitudes relationships ( see fig ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of pss ) and ii ) a set of relations ( radial tully fisher relationship ) holding at different radii @xmath115 , defined as : @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the fitting parameters , and @xmath142 is the galaxy magnitude ( persic and salucci 1991 ) .",
    "evidence for the urc claim and/or its above implications comes from : a ) detailed analyzes of independent samples : catinella et al 2006 , ( 2200 rc s , see their fig .",
    "12 ) , swaters 1999 , ( 60 extended rc s , see chapter 4 ) ; b ) independent analyzes of the pss sample : rhee ( 1996 ) , roscoe ( 1999 ) ; c ) the finding of a very tight rtf in pss and other three different samples willick ( 1997 , see below ) , yegorova et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the claim has been also tested by comparing the rcs of two samples of spirals ( courteau , 1998 , 131 objects ; verheijen , 1997 , 30 objects ) with the circular velocities predicted by the urc@xmath29 , once that the values of galaxy luminosity and disk length - scale are inserted in it .",
    "the face - value result of the test : 2/3 of the rcs are in pretty good agreement with the universal curve , while 1/3 show some disagreement , indicates that the urc is a useful tool to investigate the systematics of the mass distribution in spirals , but also it questions about its universality .",
    "however , while some of this disagreement may reflect an inefficiency of the urc@xmath29 to reproduce the rcs , the actual performance of the urc is better than it is claimed .",
    "in fact , spurious data vs predictions disagreements are created in performing this test and precisely when they insert in urc@xmath29 the values of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , affected by ( occasionally large ) observational errors . by taking into account this effect the urc@xmath29 success rate reaches @xmath145 and more .",
    "willick ( 1998 ) found , by studying a large sample of rcs , a radial variation of the scatter of the inverse rtf defined above and he interpreted it as an evidence against the urc .",
    "let us show that this argument is incorrect and that _ au contraire _ the properties of the rtf support the urc paradigm .",
    "the increase / decrease of the scatter found is very small ( willick , 1998 ) : the scatter ranges from 0.065 dex ( at @xmath146 ) to 0.080 dex ( at @xmath147 and at @xmath148 ) and it implies , if totally intrinsic , a prediction error in @xmath149 of @xmath150 .",
    "moreover , some of the scatter increase / decrease is due to the larger random observational errors present in the outermost measurements ; in fact , a refined analysis of the issue ( yegorova et al 2007 ) finds a smaller predicting error for three large sample of spirals .",
    "therefore , from the rtf we have that , in the region considered , the luminosity _ statistically _ predicts the circular velocity at any radius and in any galaxy within an error of 5% - 10% , a quantity much smaller than the variations of the latter _ in each _ galaxy and _ among _ galaxies .",

    "<S> we obtain , by combining kinematical data of their inner regions with global observational properties , the universal rotation curve ( urc ) of disk galaxies and the corresponding mass distribution out to their virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> this curve extends the results of paper  i , concerning the inner luminous regions of sb - im spirals , out to the edge of the galaxy halos . </S>"
