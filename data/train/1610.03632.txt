    "one of the most important goals of quantum information processing is to demonstrate quantum speedup over the best classical algorithms , namely quantum supremacy  @xcite to disproof the extended church - turing thesis , saying that any efficient computation by a realistic physical device can be efficiently simulated by a probabilistic turing machine .",
    "for example , if we have an ideal universal quantum computer , shor s factorization algorithm  @xcite allows us to demonstrate a super - polynomial quantum speedup over the best known classical algorithms .",
    "moreover , the threshold theorem for fault - tolerant quantum computation guarantees that an ideal universal quantum computer can be constructed from realistic quantum physical devices being subject to physically realistic imperfections  @xcite . therefore , massive efforts have been paid for experimental realizations of fault - tolerant quantum error correction  @xcite .",
    "recently intermediate models of quantum computation are attracting much attention to show quantum supremacy in experimentally feasible settings .",
    "they are not rich enough to perform universal quantum computation , but still provide nontrivial outputs , which could not be simulated efficiently by classical computers .",
    "bosonsampling with free bosons  @xcite , instantaneous quantum polynomial - time computation ( iqp ) with commuting quantum circuits  @xcite ( see also depth - four circuits  @xcite ) , highly mixed deterministic quantum computation with one - clean qubit ( dqc1 )  @xcite are examples of those .",
    "all of them are experimentally well motivated as linear optical quantum computations  @xcite , quench dynamics with ising interactions  @xcite , and nmr ensemble quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that if the output of these intermediate models are sampled efficiently by a classical computer , the polynomial hierarchy ( ph ) , a generalization of np ( nondeterministic polynomial - time computation ) to oracle machines , collapses to the third ( or second  @xcite ) level  @xcite .",
    "the collapse of the ph is thought to be highly implausible ( for example , p = np implies that a complete collapse of the ph ) , and hence classical simulation of the intermediate models is also thought to be hard .",
    "based on this understanding , several bosonsampling experiments have been performed already  @xcite .",
    "here we consider quantum supremacy of noisy quantum circuits in the pre - threshold region , where the noise strength is much higher than the standard threshold of universal fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "hence , we can not employ quantum error correction directly .",
    "then we ask whether or not there is still surviving quantum supremacy in such noisy quantum circuits",
    ". the motivation of this question is threefold .",
    "( i ) there have been several noise thresholds above which such noisy quantum circuits are classically simulatable exactly .",
    "however , they are assuming ideal stabilizer operations  @xcite , or there still be a large gap to the threshold of universal fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the characterization of the intermediate pre - threshold region , where the standard quantum error correction does not work , has been fully open for a long time .",
    "( ii ) the hardness proofs of the existing intermediate models require the sampling with constant multiplicative errors or constant additive errors with @xmath2-norm  @xcite .",
    "these notions of approximation are quite sensitive to noise . if noisy quantum circuits of a constant noise strength are employed , these criteria can not be achieved directly .",
    "thus , whether or not such noisy quantum circuits themselves can exhibit quantum supremacy has been an important open problem ( see also ref .",
    "( iii ) nowadays , it is becoming possible to operate scalable quantum devices such as superconducting qubits around the standard threshold of universal fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a complexity - guaranteed criterion of quantum supremacy for such noisy quantum devices in the pre - threshold region is highly demanded in the experiments  @xcite . to address these issues ,",
    "we derive a threshold theorem for quantum supremacy with noisy quantum circuits : if the noise strength is lower than a certain threshold value , the output of such noisy quantum circuits can not be simulated efficiently by classical computers unless the ph hierarchy collapses to the third level .",
    "contrast to the existing intermediate models  @xcite , in this work we employ quantum circuits generated from a universal set of gates , but being subject to rather strong noise , which makes the system less universal . to show hardness of classical simulation",
    ", we employ the postselection argument  @xcite .",
    "that is , we show that noisy quantum circuits can solve a postbqp - complete , or equivalently pp - complete problem under postselection . to this end , we first show that simulation of an arbitrary two - qubit output of universal quantum computation with an exponentially small additive error is enough to obtain the hardness result by postselection .",
    "then , we show that noisy quantum circuits can achieve it by virtue of postselection , where any outcomes of syndrome measurements suggesting existence of errors are discarded by postselection .",
    "this allows us to simulate universal quantum computation with an exponentially small additive error even in the pre - threshold region , where the standard quantum error correction is not available . as a technical point of view",
    ", the standard threshold theorem for universal fault - tolerant quantum computation can not be employed in the above argument .",
    "this is because , in the postselection argument , we have to treat a conditional probability distribution conditioned on an exponentially rare postselection event .",
    "therefore we derive a postselected version of the threshold theorem .",
    "the important implications of the postselected version of the threshold theorem are as follows .",
    "first , while the raw outputs of noisy quantum circuits can not satisfy the criteria for quantum supremacy directly , the logical output after an appropriate classical processing can exhibit quantum supremacy by virtue of quantum error correction , which is virtually simulated by using postselection .",
    "second , the threshold value for quantum supremacy is much higher than that of universal fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "this is because , we can discard any erroneous events suggested by the non - zero error syndromes .",
    "therefore the threshold is given not by the error correction property of quantum error correction codes but by the error detection property .",
    "third , by virtue of the above effect , the origin of quantum supremacy in noisy quantum circuits is quite clear ; it is determined by distillability of the magic state  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the standard construction of fault - tolerant quantum computation , error correction for clifford gates limits the threshold , while the threshold of magic state distillation , where error detection is employed , is much higher  @xcite . in the case of quantum supremacy",
    ", we can employ error detection for both clifford gates and magic state distillation , and hence distillability of the magic state determines the threshold of quantum supremacy .",
    "this is quite reasonable , since magic state distillation for non - clifford gates is essential for make quantum computation classically intractable  @xcite .",
    "finally , we calculate the threshold value of fault - tolerant quantum computation using the surface code on the two - dimensional array of qubits  @xcite to obtain a practically meaningful threshold of quantum supremacy . while we can not simulate postselected events numerically and hence employ an analytical treatment , which underestimates the threshold , the resultant threshold value @xmath0 is rather high compared to the standard threshold @xmath1  @xcite under the same circuit - based depolarizing noise model .",
    "this level of noise is within reach of current state - of - the - art experiments in scalable superconducting qubit systems  @xcite , and hence it would be possible to observe complexity - guaranteed quantum supremacy with noisy quantum circuits in the near future .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:01 ] , we briefly review the standard threshold theorem of universal fault - tolerant quantum computation . in sec .",
    "[ sec:02 ] , we construct the postselected threshold theorem of quantum supremacy with noisy quantum circuits . in sec .",
    "[ sec:03 ] , we perform a case study for concatenated quantum computation . in sec .

    "section  [ sec:05 ] is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "let us briefly review the standard threshold theorem of fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the ideal unitary gates in a fault - tolerant universal quantum computation is denoted by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath5th unitary gate and is chosen from a universal set of gates .",
    "quantum error correction employs both projective measurements and adaptive operations based on the measurement outcomes . here , for simplicity",
    ", all these operations including classical processing are denoted by unitary gates coherently and included in @xmath6 .",
    "then , the probability distribution of the final output of quantum computation is denoted in terms of a projective operator @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) of the final readout as @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the initial state . in order to take noise into account ,",
    "each ideal unitary gate @xmath4 is replace with a noisy one @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a completely - positive - trace - preserving ( cptp ) map representing the imperfection . here",
    "we assume the noise is local and markovian .",
    "we define a noise strength @xmath13 for each @xmath12 , where @xmath14 is the diamond norm for super - operators  @xcite",
    ". then the noisy version of the unitary gates is given by @xmath15 .",
    "note that imperfections on the initial state @xmath10 and the final measurement @xmath7 are also taken as imperfections on unitary gates at certain locations ( this is always possible since we can insert an identity gate after the state preparation and before the measurement ) .",
    "note also that the unitary gates corresponding to the classical processing are assumed to be noise - free , since they are introduced just to simplify the argument .",
    "they are implicitly omitted in the following argument .",
    "the probability distribution of the final output under the noise is given by @xmath16.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to argue fault - tolerance , we decompose the noise map @xmath12 into ideal and noisy parts as follows : @xmath17 where we should note that the noisy part @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) is not always a cptp map",
    ". then we expand @xmath20 as a summation over possible paths @xmath21 { \\mathcal{u}}_k \\right\\ } \\\\ & = & \\sum _ { \\ { \\eta _ k \\ } } \\prod _ { k } \\left\\ { \\left [ ( 1-\\epsilon _ k ) { \\mathcal{i}}\\right]^{1-\\eta _ k } { \\mathcal{e}}_k^{\\eta _ k }   { \\mathcal{u}}_k \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is taken over all paths . now we decompose these paths into sparse and faulty set of paths in such a way that the operator in the sparse set never change the final probability distribution : @xmath24^{1-\\eta _ k } { \\mathcal{e}}^{\\eta _ k } { \\mathcal{u}}_k \\right\\ } \\rho _ { \\rm ini } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\\\ & \\equiv & \\alpha p(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the faulty set is defined as the complement of the sparse set .",

    "( [ eq:01 ] ) is upper - bounded by an arbitrarily exponentially small value , which we call the standard threshold theorem .",
    "next we consider the case with postselection . in this case",
    ", we introduce another two measurement ports corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath34 is employed as a postselection register for postbqp = pp argument  @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath35 is used to postselect the events where no syndrome measurement suggests an occurrence of an error .",
    "then we have @xmath37 , \\\\",
    "p^{\\rm noisy}(x , y , z ) & = & { \\rm tr}[p_{x , y } q_z { \\mathcal{u}}^{\\rm nosiy } ( \\rho _ { \\rm ini } ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are projectors corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "since , in the ideal case with @xmath6 , @xmath35 is always zero , we have @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "( the proof has been shown already in the above . )",

    "note that without loss of generality we can assume the probability to obtain @xmath80 is bounded , @xmath81 as shown in ref .",
    "now we have @xmath82 since @xmath83 , we can choose @xmath84 such that @xmath85 .",
    "the resultant size of the noisy quantum circuit is still polynomial in @xmath66 . from the definition ( robustness against the bounded error ) of the class postbqp ( as same as postbqp ) ,",
    "the postselected noisy quantum circuit can decide problems in postbqp = pp ( recall that we can freely choose @xmath86 ) .",
    "thus postselected quantum computation of such noisy quantum circuits is as hard as pp , and hence can not be weakly simulated with the multiplicative error @xmath69 unless the ph collapses to the third level .",
    "+ @xmath87    we have considered an approximated sampling with an multiplicative error @xmath70 in lemma  [ lemma:01 ] .",
    "approximation with the constant multiplicative error imposes a stronger requirement on classical computers than the constant additive error with @xmath2-norm  @xcite .",
    "however , all imperfections including measurements are taken into @xmath12 on unitary gates @xmath4 .",
    "since here we are interested whether or not the outputs of the actual noisy experimental device possess quantum supremacy or not , an exact sampling , i.e. @xmath88 , is still enough for our purpose .",
    "note also that strong simulation , i.e. , a calculation of a probability distribution @xmath89 for a given @xmath76 , with a constant multiplicative error is too strong notion of classical simulation , and hence it is much harder than what the actual experimental device does .",
    "however , an exact weak simulation , in which we are interested , is what the actual experimental device does .    by combining theorem  [ theorem:01 ] and lemma  [ lemma:01 ]",
    ", we obtain the following threshold theorem of quantum supremacy :    suppose noise is given as a stochastic one @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "each unitary gate @xmath4 chosen from a universal set of gates is followed by such a noise @xmath12 . if the noise strength @xmath60 is smaller than a certain constant value , an efficient weak classical simulation of the sampling according to the noisy quantum circuit @xmath92 $ ] is impossible unless the ph collapses to the third level .",
    "the above theorem indicates that even noisy sampling using noisy quantum circuits can have a power to exhibit quantum supremacy against a classical simulation of them .",
    "one of the main benefit to employ the threshold theorem of quantum supremacy is that we can show quantum supremacy experimentally in a very noisy region where the noise strength is above the standard threshold , which we call a pre - threshold region . in the following",
    ", we apply the above theorem for two prototypical cases : concatenated fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite and topological fault - tolerant quantum computation with the surface codes  @xcite .",
    "to obtain a further insight , we first consider a concatenated fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "suppose each fault - tolerant logical gate at the concatenation level @xmath93 consists of at most @xmath94 logical gates of the level @xmath95 .",
    "if we employ a quantum error correction code of a distance @xmath96 , any of at most @xmath97 errors never causes a logical error . at a concatenation level @xmath93 ,",
    "the faulty operator is bounded by @xmath98 by considering the concatenation , @xmath99 is bounded in terms of @xmath100 as follows : @xmath101 where @xmath93 is the number of concatenation levels and chosen to be logarithm in the size of computation . the threshold value is given roughly by @xmath102 .",
    "on the other hand if we apply the threshold theorem for quantum supremacy , the faulty operator is bounded at each concatenation level as follows : @xmath103 similarly to the previous case , the threshold is given roughly given by @xmath104 .",
    "for example , let us take @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and assume @xmath107 . in the leading order , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the threshold of quantum supremacy @xmath110 is improved from that @xmath111 for universal quantum computation by a factor of @xmath112 .",
    "next we will consider topologically protected fault - tolerant quantum computation with the surface code  @xcite to obtain a practical threshold value for quantum supremacy .",
    "quantum error correction using the surface code with imperfect syndrome measurements is governed on primal and dual cubic lattices ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed review ) .",
    "below we consider the primal cubic lattice only , by assuming error correction is done on primal and dual cubic lattices independently , which results in an underestimate of the threshold .",
    "then , errors are assigned on edges of the cubic lattice as an error chain , and the errors are detected at the boundary of the error chain .",
    "if the error and recovery chains result in a topologically nontrivial cycle , the error correction fails . in the topologically protected region ,",
    "the defects representing logical qubits are designed such that the nontrivial cycle consists of a connected chain of length longer than @xmath96 . around the singular qubit for non - clifford operations",
    ", we have to take into account nontrivial cycles of length shorter than @xmath96 too .",
    "let us first consider the phenomenological noise model , where the errors are distributed independently and identically on each edge with probability @xmath113 .",
    "now @xmath114 is divided into two parts @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which correspond to the errors in the topologically protected region and others originated from the errors around the singular qubits , respectively .",
    "since we can postselect the null syndrome measurements , @xmath117 is attributed from the errors on the connected chain of length longer than @xmath96 ( the error chain of length shorter than @xmath96 always results in an erroneous syndrome in the topologically protected region , and hence is postselected ) .",

    "note that while the resultant threshold @xmath121 is somehow underestimated by the above analytical treatment , it is much higher than the standard threshold @xmath122  @xcite in the topologically protected region calculated from numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , the protection around singular qubit becomes important . around the singular qubits ,",
    "the logical error is bounded by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the number of the self - avoiding walks that result in the logical errors of length shorter than @xmath96 around the singular qubits ( the error of length longer than @xmath96 is taken in @xmath125 ) . in ref .",

    "<S> this allows us to show that the output sampled from the noisy quantum circuits ( without postselection ) can not be simulated efficiently by classical computers based on a stable complexity theoretical conjecture , i.e. , non - collapse of the polynomial hierarchy . by applying this to fault - tolerant quantum computation with the surface codes </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the threshold value @xmath0 for quantum supremacy , which is much higher than the standard threshold @xmath1 for universal fault - tolerant quantum computation with the same circuit - level noise model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , contrast to the standard noise threshold , the origin of quantum supremacy in noisy quantum circuits is quite clear ; the threshold is determined purely by the threshold of magic state distillation , which is essential to gain a quantum advantage . </S>"
