    "lower and upper bounds of the kazhdan constants are known for some examples of groups , but to compute the value of the kazhdan constant is usually hard .    recently ozawa @xcite found a new characterization of a kazhdan group among finitely generated groups .",

    "we obtain lower bounds of the kazhdan constants , which are almost identical to the actual values ( tables [ table : cmsz2_q=2 ] and [ table : cmsz2_q=3 ] ) .",
    "we regard this computation as an evidence that our method is effective to compute a good lower bound .",
    "we also point out that this class of groups is interesting in various ways , for example , the equality holds in two basic inequalities regarding the spectral gaps and the kazhdan constants ( see corollary [ gap.achieve ] ) .",
    "we then discuss another class of groups , @xmath1 , which also act on some @xmath0-buildings .",
    "this family is found by ronan @xcite , then studied from various viewpoints , including by tits @xcite as `` triangles of groups '' ( see section [ sec : ronan ] ) . in particular they are kazhdan groups , but the kazhdan constants are unknown .",

    "the bigger the support range @xmath74 is , the more chance there is that the computation will not be finished . also , even if the algorithm stops for some @xmath74 and gives a positive @xmath38 , maybe there is a solution for bigger @xmath74 that gives a larger @xmath38 , so that our @xmath38 is smaller than the spectral gap .",
    "see section [ sec : sl_f ] for an example of the numerical result that shows different bounds for different @xmath74 .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that sometimes , the @xmath38 we obtain for a small @xmath74 is very close to the actual spectral gap ( for example , table [ table : cmsz2_q=2 ] ) .",

    "compared to @xcite there is one extra ingredient in our approach . to obtain a lower bound of the kazhdan constant of @xmath3 , only integer matrices and rational numbers appear in the algorithm to solve the equation [ eq : ozawa ] .",
    "so , a computation is done without dealing with a presentation of the group .",
    "but we start with a finite presentation of a group ( except for @xmath13 and finite groups ) then try to solve the equation [ eq : ozawa ] . for that , as a part of the algorithm , we ( have to ) replace a product of generators with another product in the right hand side of the equation properly using a relation of the group .",
    "but we do not use / need the solution of the word problem of the group .",
    "notice that once we find a solution of the equation [ eq : ozawa ] , even if without completely solving the word problem on the way , the @xmath38 we get is a lower bound for the group .",
    "possibly this part of the algorithm ( ie , how much we do the replacement ) may affect its efficiency .",
