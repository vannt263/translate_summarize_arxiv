    "given a set of @xmath2 simple geometric objects in the plane , called sites , the _ order-@xmath0 voronoi diagram _ of @xmath11 is a partitioning of the plane into regions , such that every point within a given order-@xmath0 region has the same @xmath0 nearest sites . for @xmath12",
    ", we derive the classic _ nearest - neighbor voronoi diagram _ , and for @xmath13 , the _ farthest - site voronoi diagram_.    for point - sites , the order-@xmath0 voronoi diagram has been studied extensively in the computational geometry literature , see e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite for a survey .",
    "surprisingly , it has been largely ignored for any other type of site .",
    "this is the case even for simple line segments , which nevertheless , play a fundamental role in applications involving polygonal objects in the plane .",
    "see e.g. ,  @xcite for applications of higher - order line - segment voronoi diagrams in deriving the _ probability of fault _ in a vlsi design under _ random manufacturing defects_. even the farthest line - segment voronoi diagram ( @xmath13 ) has only recently been considered by aurenhammer et al .",

    "no prior work exists on order-@xmath0 voronoi diagrams , @xmath14 , for generalized sites , other than points and additively weighted points  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate combinatorial properties and the basic iterative construction for the order-@xmath0 voronoi diagram of line segments .",
    "we first establish complexity results for disjoint line segments , and then extend our investigation to line segments forming a _ planar straight - line graph _ ( pslg , in short ) and arbitrary line segments that may intersect .",
    "although a single order-@xmath0 voronoi region may disconnect into @xmath1 disjoint faces , we show that the combinatorial complexity of the diagram for @xmath2 non - crossing line segments remains @xmath3 , as in the case of points where no disconnected regions exist .",
    "in addition , the union of all faces affiliated with a segment @xmath15 forms a connected region , which is _ weakly star - shaped _ with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "the case of a pslg is particularly interesting . on one hand , this is important for applications involving polygonal objects in the plane or embedded planar graphs ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and on the other , it introduces new requirements for the definition of an order-@xmath0 voronoi diagram .",
    "segments in a planar straight - line graph are not disjoint , thus , the standard definition of an order-@xmath0 voronoi diagram for disjoint sites is not sufficient , because areas may exist , which are equidistant from multiple sites whose number is independent of @xmath0 .",

    "we show that intersections only affect the asymptotic complexity of the diagram for small @xmath16 . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the asymptotic complexity of the diagram is independent of the number of intersections , i.e. , it remains @xmath3 .",
    "we also extend our results to the general @xmath5 metric , @xmath6 , and show a tighter bound of @xmath9 for @xmath10 and non - intersecting line segments . to construct the diagram",

    "a plane sweep approach is given in  @xcite .",
    "in a subsequent companion paper  @xcite , we generalize the combinatorial results for disjoint line segments to _ higher - order abstract voronoi diagrams _ and refine their complexity bound to @xmath17 .",
    "non - disjoint line segments , such as line segments forming a pslg and intersecting line segments addressed in this paper , do not fall under the umbrella of abstract voronoi diagrams in our companion paper , as their bisectors do not comply with the axioms of the underlying system of bisectors .",
