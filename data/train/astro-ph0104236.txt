    "binary qsos occur at a rate of about one per thousand qsos @xcite .",
    "typical angular separations are 3  to 10 . true binaries , as opposed to gravitational lenses , may be recognized by different radio emission or different emission - line or bal characteristics in their component spectra @xcite .",
    "binary qsos presumably represent galaxy encounters in which tidal interactions have led to an enhanced probability of nuclear activity @xcite .",
    "such events may offer important insights into the fueling of agn and the timescales for the mergers of galaxies and their central black holes @xcite .",
    "in the course of a study of qsos with broad absorption lines ( bals ) , we have discovered that lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is a binary qso with a separation of only 03 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a physical separation of only 2 kpc .",
    "the closest previously known binaries have spacings of 15 kpc or more @xcite .",
    "such a close spacing suggests an advanced merger , with the two supermassive black holes well within the nascent bulge of the merged galaxy .",
    "lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is one of eight balqsos included in a study , by the authors , of the ultraviolet spectra of balqsos at moderate redshift with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( ) on the hubble space telescope ( ) .",
    "the object has an emission - line redshift @xmath1 = 0.848 and an apparent magnitude @xmath2 = 18.1 , and its lbqs spectrum shows broad absorption in mg ii @xmath32798 @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the stis ccd acquisition image .",
    "the a / b flux ratio is 3.1 , implying magnitudes @xmath2 = 18.2 and 19.4 for components a and b , respectively . the fwhms of the images are consistent with point sources , and the separation is @xmath4=0.295 @xmath5 0.011 arcsec in position angle + 30.1@xmath6 @xmath5 2.2@xmath6 ( a northeast of b ) .    a 52  by 02  slit was used for the spectroscopic observations ( figure 2 ) with the stis nuv  mama using the g230l grating .",
    "the qso pair was , by luck , almost perfectly aligned with the stis slit , itself aligned along the image + y axis .",
    "the resolution at 2400    is 3.3    fwhm .",
    "we obtained an optical spectrum of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 ( sum of both components ) in august 1998 using the ctio blanco 4 m telescope .",
    "the spectrum @xcite shows a dramatic weakening of the mg ii bal , which is unusual @xcite .",
    "lbqs 0103@xmath02753 a has strong bals of c iv @xmath71548,1551 , si iv @xmath31400 , n v @xmath31240 , and o vi @xmath31034 that are absent in the spectrum of component b. in addition , the two components have very different emission - line properties .",
    "this effectively rules out the possibility that the object is a lensed qso .",
    "junkkarinen et al .",
    "@xcite argue that the likelihood also is small that lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is a chance alignment of a wider binary of the 3  to 10  ( @xmath840  kpc ) variety .",
    "could lbqs 0103@xmath02753 be a chance superposition of two unrelated qsos ?",
    "the emission - line redshifts of the two components , though similar , differ by more than the 600  difference typical of binary qsos @xcite .",
    "the redshift of b is well determined at @xmath9 = 0.858 , but the bals and emission - line profiles of component a make the emission - line redshift quite uncertain .",
    "the c iv line gives @xmath10 = 0.834 , which corresponds to a velocity difference from @xmath9 of 3900  .",
    "however , c  iv emission lines are often blueshifted from the systemic redshift @xcite , especially in the case of weak , low contrast lines as in component a @xcite .",
    "how likely is a chance coincidence of a qso as bright as the apparent magnitude of component b within this redshift range and within an angular separation of 03 ?",
    "we take a surface density of 10 qsos per square degree between b = 18.2 and 19.4 , for qsos with redshifts @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "if we assume these are distributed roughly uniformly with redshift , then the odds of having a second qso within 03 of a given qso , and with a redshift difference not more than @xmath12 , is @xmath13 . if @xmath8500 qsos have been observed in a way that would reveal such a binary ( see below ) , then the odds of having one chance alignment resembling lbqs 0103@xmath02753 , among all these targets ,",
    "is only @xmath14 .",
    "this supports the conclusion that lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is a true , physical binary .",
    "the greatest number of opportunities to discover a pair like lbqs 0103@xmath02753 appears to be offered by the  snapshot survey for gravitationally lensed qsos @xcite .",
    "this involved 498 qsos with @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( = 100 , = 0.5 ) .",
    "the snapshot survey could have detected a binary with the characteristics of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 @xcite .",
    "however , it did not find any binary qsos with separations less than 10 .",
    "from the one example of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 , we therefore estimate a rate of roughly 1/500 for separations",
    "this in turn suggests that there are @xmath810 unrecognized binaries in the 03 range among the @xmath8@xmath17 known qsos .",
    "junkkarinen et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that lbqs 0103@xmath02753 represents an advanced stage of a galactic merger .",
    "the cores of the two galaxies are merging , and the black holes are settling into an orbit of radius similar to the observed spacing of 2 kpc .",
    "the wider binaries observed , with physical spacing of @xmath820 to 100 kpc , likely represent mergers at an earlier stage .",
    "simulations of colliding disk galaxies @xcite indicate that gas accumulates in the nucleus of each galaxy as the two orbit away from each other after the first close encounter .",
    "the duration of this first large orbital loop is @xmath8@xmath18 yr .",
    "dynamical friction causes rapid decay of subsequent loops , and the central regions of the galaxies merge quickly .",
    "the final merger involves a massive concentration of gas in the nucleus capable of fueling powerful starbursts and agn activity .",
    "junkkarinen et al .",
    "@xcite estimate the masses of the black holes and the properties of the host galaxies from the qso s luminosities and the relationship between black hole mass and bulge properties of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "this leads to an estimated lifetime of the binary black hole orbit , at the observed 2 kpc spacing , of only @xmath8@xmath19 years .",
    "this in turn suggests that the probability of a merger being active as a binary qso is larger during the 2 kpc stage than during the 40 kpc stage .",
    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs , @xmath20 ) typically involve galactic mergers @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the mean nuclear spacing of @xmath82 kpc is similar to that of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 .",
    "the brighter uligs are believed to be powered predominantly by agn .",
    "lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is distinguished from typical uligs by the lack of heavy extinction , as well as an exceptionally high luminosity .",
    "infrared observations of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 would be valuable to determine whether massive amounts of dust are still present in the vicinity of the qsos .",
    "we have estimated that binaries as close as lbqs 0103@xmath02753 occur with a frequency of @xmath8@xmath21 . given this low incidence , searches for 03 binaries would benefit from any criterion to narrow the list of candidates . until our  observations , lbqs 0103@xmath02753 was not , to our knowledge , suspected of being a binary qso .",
    "the great diversity of qso spectra makes it difficult to specify spectroscopic criteria with which to identify candidate binaries .",
    "objects with double peaked narrow line emission ( [ o iii ]  @xmath35007 or [ o ii ]  @xmath33727 ) might include some candidates .",
    "composite broad emission - line profiles of an unusual character might also be an indicator , e.g. , the qso b340 @xcite .",
    "ideally , one could identify two properties of qsos that almost never occur together .",
    "the rare exceptions would then be candidates for unresolved binaries .",
    "one possibility might be balqsos with strong , unabsorbed soft x - ray fluxes ; balqsos as a class show weak soft x - ray fluxes , relative to the optical continuum , evidently because of absorption @xcite .",
