    "the most metal - poor stars , believed to have formed at redshifts @xmath7 5 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and representing well - defined points in space and time , hold clues on the conditions at the earliest epochs that are provided by no other astronomical objects . that is to say , the study of their metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , together with their relative chemical abundance patterns , have the potential to shed light on the nature of the first generation of objects to form in the universe , and the manner in which the stellar - made elements ( those heavier than li ) first formed .",
    "consider first the mdf .",
    "four decades after the classic analysis of the archtypical metal - poor stars hd  19445 and hd  140283 by @xcite , it could be claimed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the mdf for halo material with = log(n(fe)/n(h))@xmath8  log(n(fe)/n(h)@xmath9 , @xmath10 = log(n(fe)/n(h))@xmath8 + 12.00 ] [ fe / h ] @xmath7 4.0 was in reasonable agreement with the predictions of the simple closed box model of galactic chemical enrichment ( the simple model ) of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "following efforts since that time , however , it has become clear that this is not the case below [ fe / h ] @xmath4  4.0 : while two objects are currently known at [ fe / h ] @xmath5 5.3 ( he  01075840 , @xcite , and he  1327@xmath12326 , @xcite ) , the mdf presented by @xcite and the simple model lead one to expect some 40 such objects below [ fe / h ]  =  4.0 . figure  [ fig : lowfe_mdf ] , which shows the mdf for the unbiased metal - poor objects that have been the subject of high - resolution , high signal - to - noise ( @xmath0 ) model - atmosphere ( one - dimensional ( 1d ) , local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) ) chemical abundance analyses @xmath4 2.0 .",
    "the low spectral - resolution prism surveys , which supply the vast majority of stars known with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.0 , are unable to detect the presence of the ca  ii k line for all but the very coolest stars . as a result ,",
    "the possibility of introducing bias into the selection function for the lowest metallicity stars is even more remote .",
    "when high - resolution spectra are available one is able to guard against contamination by stellar ch and interstellar ca ii lines that might have militated against recognition of the most metal - poor objects in the discovery phase .",
    "see @xcite . ] , demonstrates a second tantalizing fact .",
    "in contrast to the expectation of a continuously decreasing mdf , the two objects at [ fe / h ] @xmath5 5.3 lie some 1.5 dex below the next most metal - poor objects at [ fe / h ]  =  4.0 . despite low numbers ,",
    "this has led some ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to speak of the possibility of a metallicity  gap \" at lowest abundance , which could have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of the first generation of objects that chemically enriched the galaxy , and presumably the universe .",
    "consider next the relative abundance characteristics of the two stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath5 5.3 .",
    "their most distinctive features are the enormous overabundances , relative to iron , of carbon ( [ c / fe ] @xmath5 4 ) , nitrogen ( [ n / fe ] @xmath5 24 ) , and oxygen ( [ o / fe ] @xmath5 23 ) ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this , taken together with the well - established fact that the incidence of carbon richness increases as one proceeds to lower abundance in the range 4.0 @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 2.0 @xcite , suggests that the trend of increasing carbon - richness continues to ubiquitous c enhancement at [ fe / h ] @xmath5 5.0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowfe_mdf ] shows this trend , where the shaded regions represent objects with [ c / fe ] @xmath7 1.0",
    ". the simplest explanation of this phenomenon is that the earliest objects in the universe produced large amounts of cno relative to fe , far in excess of the ratios produced at later times .",
    "candidate sites include supernovae with  mixing and fallback \" ( see @xcite , and references therein ) and rotating massive stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that relative overabundances of carbon ( and/or oxygen ) are necessary below [ fe / h ] = 4.0 to provide the cooling of primordial material via and at the earliest times to form the low mass stars we observe today .",
    "we shall return to this point in  [ cno ]    two questions then beg to be addressed .",
    "first , is the 5.3 @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 4.0  gap \" real , and second , what is the incidence of cno richness below [ fe / h ] @xmath4 4.0 ?",
    "given the rarity of objects below this limit , one might expect definitive answers to be some time in coming .",
    "that said , the purpose of the present paper is to begin the task .",
    "we present here the discovery and analysis of he  0557@xmath14840 , a third object having [ fe / h ] @xmath4 4.0 . in  [ observations ]",
    "we report its discovery , and the high - resolution , high @xmath0 data obtained to address these questions .",
    "our model - atmosphere analysis of this material to produce accurate chemical abundances is then described in   [ parameters][analysis ] .",
    "finally , in  [ discussion ] we discuss the significance of this object . while much future work remains to be done , we find that the existence of he  0557@xmath14840 with [ fe / h ]  =  4.75 weakens the case for the 5.3 @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 4.0  gap \" canvassed above . on the other hand , with [ c / fe ]  =  + 1.6 ( and [ n / fe ] @xmath4 + 1.5 and",
    "[ o / fe ] @xmath4 + 3.1 ) , the data for he  0557@xmath14840 are consistent with the suggestion that below [ fe / h ] @xmath4 4.0 all stars possess strong enhancement of at least some elements of the cno group .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ summary ] .",

    "comparison of these spectra shows that the two stars have comparable hydrogen line strength , and therefore similar effective temperature , while the ca ii line is weaker in he  0557@xmath14840 , suggestive of a lower abundance of calcium .",
    "perhaps equally interesting is that the g band of ch at 4300  is considerably stronger in he  0557@xmath14840 . given that ch is not detected in cd@xmath11 ( [ c / fe ] @xmath4 0.3 , @xcite ) it was immediately obvious that he  0557@xmath14840 is carbon rich relative to cd@xmath11 .",

    "he  0557@xmath14840 was then observed in service mode at the very large telescope ( vlt ) unit telescope 2 ( ut2 ) with the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) during the nights of 2006 february 5 , 25 , and 26 and march 19 .",
    "seven individual exposures with an integration time of 1h each were obtained .",
    "uves was used in dichroic mode with the blue390 and red580 settings .",
    "the useful wavelength ranges , in the rest frame of he  0557@xmath14840 , are 33004520 in the blue - arm spectra , and 48205750 and 58356800 in the lower- and upper- red - arm spectra , respectively .",
    "a @xmath18 slit was used in both arms , yielding a nominal resolving power of @xmath19 .",
    "since read - out noise was not a limitation , @xmath20 pixel binning was employed during the observations , even though this results in a significant oversampling due to the scale of @xmath21 per pixel of the blue - arm ccd and @xmath22 per pixel in the red - arm .",
    "the seven pipeline - reduced spectra were co - added in an iterative procedure in which pixels in the individual spectra affected by cosmic ray hits not fully removed during the data reduction , affected by ccd defects , or other artifacts , were identified .",
    "these pixels were flagged and ignored in the final iteration of the co - addition .",
    "the co - added blue - arm spectra , rebinned by a factor of 2 , have a maximum @xmath0 per pixel of @xmath23 at @xmath24 , decreasing to @xmath25 at the red end . at the blue end , this decreases to @xmath26 at 3700 , and @xmath27 at 3300 . in the rebinned lower red - arm spectra ,",

    "the mean internal standard error of measurement of a single observation is 0.2 kms@xmath31 , while the external error is estimated to be 0.7 kms@xmath31 @xcite .    given that the dispersion of velocities in the table is 0.21 kms@xmath31 , we conclude that to within the accuracy of our measurements the velocity of he  0557@xmath14840 did not vary over the 43 days of the present observations .",

    "a population ii variation on this theme is that he  0557@xmath14840 could be a second- or later- generation object that has experienced mass transfer from an erstwhile more massive ( possibly agb ) companion , leading to enrichment of carbon but not of the heavy neutron - capture elements .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of this mechanism .    in neither case can such models be excluded as an explanation of he  0557@xmath14840 by the current level of non - detection of radial velocity variations  as reported in  [ radial_velocities ] ,",
    "none has been detected in the present , albeit sparse , data . future continued radial velocity monitoring is needed to potentially reach a definitive conclusion on its multiplicity .",
    "the interpretation of he  0557@xmath14840 with [ fe / h ]  =  4.8 , and [ c / fe ]  =  + 1.6 as a single , population ii , object requires a scenario in which carbon has been overproduced relative to the heavier elements .",
    "while for he  0557@xmath14840 one seeks to understand the large c enhancement , our current lack of knowledge concerning the abundances of n and o suggests that one might also consider a more general solution ( applicable not only to c but also other light elements ) that involves the preferential expulsion , during the explosion of objects with masses greater than @xmath5  10 m@xmath130 , of the outer layers ( in which the lighter elements but not the heavier ones have been synthesized ) , but in which only a small fraction of the inner regions ( where the heavier elements have also been produced ) is expelled .",

    "( that said , while the statistics are poor , the number of objects with 5.0 @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 4.0 is lower by a factor @xmath534 than predicted at the earliest times by existing models of galactic chemical enrichment . )    the abundance pattern of he  0557@xmath14840 has been discussed in the context of single and two - component enrichment models .",
    "existing `` mixing and fallback '' models provide a poor explanation of the observed relative abundances , while a two - component model provides a better , but still inadequate one .",
    "the overabundance of carbon in he  0557@xmath14840 is ( marginally ) consistent with the hypothesis of @xcite that carbon ( and oxygen ) richness may be a necessary requirement for formation of low mass stars at the earliest times .",
    "further data are required to determine the oxygen abundance and improve that of co , and hence more strongly constrain the origin of he  0557@xmath14840 .",
    "we would like to thank the director s discretionary time committee of eso for allocating time to this project .",
    "we express our gratitude to the eso staff on paranal and in garching for carrying out the observations , and reducing the data , respectively .",
    "we are grateful to thomas szeifert for making it possible for the observations of he  0107@xmath15240 to be initiated on the night of 5 february , 2006 , and to b. plez and a. jorissen for providing us with @xmath137ch and @xmath138ch line lists .",
