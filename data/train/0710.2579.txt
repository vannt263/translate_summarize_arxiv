    "among various approaches to the holographic dual of large @xmath0 qcd , the model proposed by sakai and sugimoto @xcite is one of the most successful ones at present both theoretically and phenomenologically .",
    "this model with @xmath1 massless quarks is constructed using the brane configuration of @xmath0 d4-branes and @xmath1 d8-branes in type iia superstring theory .",
    "they analyzed the effective theory of d8-branes on the d4-brane background , which is a @xmath2 yang - mills ( ym ) theory with chern - simons ( cs ) term on a curved five - dimensional background .",
    "they found that this model has massless pion as the nambu - goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking and infinite number of massive ( axial-)vector mesons .",
    "it well reproduces various phenomenologically important parameters such as the masses and the couplings of the mesons .",
    "moreover , when we truncate all the massive modes , then the effective theory is found to be the skyrme model @xcite with wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xcite , which is known as the effective theory of massless mesons .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model ( ss - model ) can also describe the baryon degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been argued that , in the ads / cft correspondence , a baryon is identified as a d - brane wrapped around a sphere @xcite . in the ss - model , this d - brane , which is a d4-brane wrapped on @xmath3 in the color d4-brane background , is realized as a soliton in the effective theory of d8-brane , namely , the five dimensional ym+cs theory .",
    "therefore , when we quantize the collective coordinates of the instanton , the baryon spectra are expected to appear as in the case of the skyrme model @xcite . in @xcite , explicit construction of the baryon solution in the ym+cs theory and its collective coordinate quantization",
    "were carried out in the case of @xmath4 in the approximation of large thooft coupling @xmath5 ( see also @xcite for the construction of the solution ) .",
    "the baryon solution at a fixed time was found to be the bpst instanton solution @xcite with its size of order @xmath6 determined by the energy balance : the curved color d4-brane background tends to shrink the instanton size , while the coulomb self - energy from the cs term favors larger instanton .",
    "quantization of the collective coordinates including the size of the instanton leads to the baryon spectra which agree fairly well with experiments by taking a suitable kaluza - klein mass scale @xmath7 of the theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the study of @xcite to the case of three flavors , @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , this is not a simple problem .",
    "first , all the quarks are massless in the original ss - model , and we have to modify the model to give at least the strange quark a mass .",
    "this is absolutely necessary for the comparison of the model with experiments .",
    "though there have appeared a number of proposals to generate quark and meson masses in the ss - model @xcite , concrete calculation seems not easy at present . in this paper",
    "we focus on another problem in the @xmath8 ss - model , namely , the problem associated with the cs term . as we mentioned above , the @xmath9 part of the cs term plays an important role in giving the instanton a non - vanishing size already in the @xmath4 case . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath10 part of the cs term vanishes identically in the @xmath4 case , and @xmath8 is the first nontrivial place where the non - abelian part of the cs term enters the analysis of the theory .    to explain the problem of the cs term in the @xmath8 ss - model ,",
    "let us recall the role of the wzw term in the quantization of the collective coordinate of the @xmath11 rotation of the baryon solution in the @xmath8 skyrme model @xcite ( the wzw term vanishes identically in the @xmath4 case ) . in this case",
    ", there arises a first class constraint @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the eighth - component of the charge of @xmath14 , whose first three components @xmath15 constitute the @xmath16 of space rotation , and the rhs , @xmath17 , is from the wzw term .",
    "the constraint selects the correct baryon states with spin @xmath18 for the flavor octet and those with spin @xmath19 for the decuplet from the @xmath14 octet and decuplet , respectively , containing also other states with wrong spins .    in the ss - model ,",
    "the cs term should play the role of the wzw term in the skyrme model ( recall that the wzw term is reproduced from the cs term in the low energy limit @xcite ) .",
    "however , in collective coordinate quantization of the baryon solution in the ss - model with @xmath8 , the cs term originally proposed in @xcite ( given as in sec.[sec : baryonsolution ] ) vanishes identically as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : lcc ] .",
    "this implies the absurd result that the constraint in the ss - model is @xmath20 instead of .    to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we propose a new cs term for the ss - model ( see eq .  ) .",
    "our new cs term is strictly gauge invariant , in contrast to the original cs term of @xcite which is not invariant under `` large '' gauge transformations .",
    "however , for defining our cs term , we need a fictitious sixth coordinate just as the wzw term needs the fifth coordinate . with our new cs term , we can carry out the collective coordinate quantization of the baryon solution and get the desired constraint .",
    "the two cs terms , and , are naively the same if we use the relation @xmath21 .",
    "the reason why the two cs terms lead to different results is that the bpst instanton solution needs two patches for describing it in the whole four - dimensional space including both the origin and the infinity , and hence the space of integration for is not the only boundary of that for ( see appendix [ app : another ] for details ) . in this paper , we introduce the sixth dimension for our cs term simply by hand .",
    "it is interesting if this extra dimension has its origin in ten dimensions of iia superstring theory , though this seems not so easy as we discuss in sec .",

    "[ sec : baryonsolution ] , we write down our model , five dimensional @xmath2 ym+cs theory in curved background , and obtain the classical solution representing a baryon .",
