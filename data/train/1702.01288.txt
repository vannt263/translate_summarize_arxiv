    "in 1930 ornstein and uhlenbeck  @xcite introduced the stochastic process which afterwards carried their name in order to treat the case where the particle undergoing a motion of brownian type has a surrounding medium which is a rarefied gas instead of a liquid .",
    "they argued that in this case one has to take into account the friction that the particle experiences by hitting the gas molecules , which they called _ doppler friction_. as a consequence , they proposed an equation of langevin type for the velocity of the particle instead of for its position .",
    "they proved that the velocity of the so defined motion admits a stationary state which is described by a centered normal density . for a discussion of the ornstein  uhlenbeck process from the physics point of view , especially in comparison to the einstein ",
    "smoluchowski theory of brownian motion , we refer the interested reader to  @xcite .",
    "for example in  @xcite one can find a treatment within the context of it s theory of stochastic differential equations .",
    "the ground breaking paper  @xcite by dudley in 1965 was the first in which a relativistic wiener process has been constructed . since then a large amount of literature on diffusion processes in the frameworks of special and general relativity has been published .",
    "we refer the interested reader especially to the overview papers  @xcite , to the literature quoted there , and also to @xcite .    a construction of a relativistic ornstein  uhlenbeck process is provided by  @xcite , based on a relativistic formulation of the langevin equation . in  @xcite haba",
    "has studied a variety of relativistic diffusion processes , and among them also processes of ornstein  uhlenbeck type .",
    "the relation of these papers to the model we construct in the present manuscript has still to be worked out .",
    "we consider the momentum of the particle as the basic dynamical quantity .",
    "therefore we consider the relativistic four momentum @xmath0 of a massive point particle , and the special theory of relativity demands that @xmath1 has to be a point of the mass shell , that is the condition @xmath2 has always to be fulfilled , where @xmath3 is the mass of the particle , and @xmath4 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "it turns out that the mass shell is a @xmath5 dimensional riemannian manifold , and which therefore is equipped with a canonical , positive definite laplace ",

    "therefore we first construct a stochastic process of wiener type on the mass shell , which has this laplace ",
    "beltrami operator as its generator , and the resulting process is a version of dudley s wiener process  @xcite .",
    "next , via an it stochastic differential equation , we add a drift of a specific form ( cf .",
    "section  [ sect_ou ] ) to this wiener process in order to imitate the drift which has been introduced by ornstein and uhlenbeck to model the doppler friction . as consequence ,",
    "we obtain a stochastic process which we call _ relativistic ornstein  uhlenbeck momentum process _ , which moves on the mass shell and admits a stationary state .",

    "show first two lemmas . in order to simplify our notation for the following discussion we shall temporarily set @xmath93 .",
    "the first step is to prove the analogue statement as in theorem  [ thm_ex_un_b0 ] for _ weak _ existence and uniqueness :    [ lem_wex_wun_b0 ] for every starting point @xmath83 the sde   has a weak solution @xmath70 which is unique in law , and with paths which are @xmath84a.s .  strictly positive . moreover , the solutions are transient in the following sense : for every @xmath85 and every initial condition @xmath86 the event @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the first hitting time of @xmath89 by @xmath79 , has strictly positive probability , and on this set @xmath94 @xmath84a.s .",

    "furthermore we remark in passing that the existence of a weak solution is equivalent to the existence of the associated martingale problem ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "we show that the conditions of theorems  2.16 , 4.2 , and part  ( viii ) of theorem  4.6 in  @xcite hold true .",

    "we fix some @xmath85 for the remainder of this proof .",
    "next we compute the density @xmath99 of the so - called scale functions .",
    "since in our case the diffusion coefficient is equal to  @xmath100 , @xmath99 is given by @xmath101 furthermore we define the scale functions @xmath102,\\\\      { \\kappa}_\\infty(s ) & = -\\int_s^\\infty \\rho(u)\\,du,\\qquad s\\in[a,+\\infty).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath103 , we clearly have from   that @xmath104 moreover we claim that the following are true : @xmath105 the integral  @xmath106 is equal to @xmath107 since @xmath108 is convex , we have for all @xmath109 $ ] the inequalities @xmath110 therefore we can estimate as follows @xmath111 for @xmath63 we get @xmath112 while for @xmath113 we find @xmath114          & \\times\\,\\bigl(s^{-(d-2 ) } - a^{-(d-2)}\\bigr)\\,ds < + \\infty . \\end{split}\\ ] ] hence   is proved , and together with   this shows that the conditions of theorem  2.16 in  @xcite are fulfilled .",
    "as a consequence we get the statement that the sde   has for every starting point @xmath115 a unique weak solution up to the first hitting time @xmath88 , and the solution is a.s .",

    "based on the wiener process constructed on the mass shell @xmath28 in the previous section , we shall construct here stochastic processes on @xmath150 which resemble the standard ornstein  uhlenbeck process . as we have recalled in section  [ sect_intro ] , in the usual euclidean setting the ornstein  uhlenbeck process is constructed by adding ( via a stochastic differential equation ) a linear drift term to a standard wiener process , which pushes the wiener process back towards the origin . as a consequence , the classical ornstein  uhlenbeck process has an invariant distribution which is given by a centered normal law .",
    "consider first the special cases @xmath63 , @xmath5 , and the sde s  , , for the wiener processes on the mass shell .",
    "clearly , one can not simply add linear drift terms to these sde s , since there is no guarantee that the resulting process would continue to live on the mass shells  actually , as our computations below show , this will definitely not be the case .",
    "instead we introduce  for general space dimension @xmath7  an additional drift term into the sde   in hyperbolic coordinates .",
    "then we take the skew product of this new process in the @xmath67-coordinate with a standard wiener process on the unit sphere @xmath30 as in  , . transforming this process via   into a stochastic process with values in @xmath9",
    "we obtain a process which lives on the mass shell @xmath150 , if started thereon .",
    "it turns out that a simple , natural choice for the additional drift term is given by @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is some non - negative constant .",
    "so we consider now the sde @xmath153 with @xmath154 hence for @xmath155 we have a backward drift which is asymptotically constant with value  @xmath156 .",
    "the choice of this additional drift term has two advantages : for one , it turns out that in the special cases @xmath63 , @xmath65 the sde s in cartesian coordinates will be supplemented with almost linear drifts , which are directed towards the origin and compensate the linear outward drifts which we had observed for wiener processes in the sde s  , .",
    "therefore this shows some similarity with the construction of the classical ornstein  uhlenbeck process .",
    "moreover , for @xmath152 large enough this additional drift yields the existence of an invariant state for the resulting process , which can be computed explicitly ( as well as some other invariant states , see section  [ sect_im ] ) .    for the question of existence and uniqueness of solutions of   we have the following    [ thm_ex_un_ou ] for every initial condition @xmath157 , the stochastic differential equation   has a pathwise unique , strong solution which is a.s .",

    "the solution is transient in the same sense as in theorem  [ thm_ex_un_b0 ] . for @xmath159",

    "@xmath160 .",
    "the proof is quite similar to the one of theorem  [ thm_ex_un_b0 ] , so we only sketch it .",
    "again we temporarily put @xmath161 for notational simplicity . in this case",
    "the scale density @xmath99 becomes @xmath162 therefore the estimations leading to the inequalities   and   are completely unaffected by the additional smooth , bounded function @xmath163 , and we find again that the singularity at @xmath35 is of _ type  3_. however , instead of   we this time get the following for any fixed @xmath85 : @xmath164 this shows that for @xmath159 we get now _ type  a _ for the behavior at @xmath165 , as defined on p.  82 in  @xcite . for @xmath158 we have to estimate the present analogue of @xmath166 , see  . to this end , we use in addition to   the trivial bounds @xmath167 .",
    "the result is @xmath168 .",
    "hence for @xmath158 the behavior at infinity is again of _ type  b_. now we apply once more theorem  4.6.(viii ) in  @xcite to conclude that for every initial condition @xmath169 we have the existence of a strictly positive weak solution which is unique in law .",
    "observe that the drift @xmath170 is monotone decreasing on @xmath71 , so that by the same argument as in the proof of lemma  [ lem_punique ] pathwise uniqueness of the solutions holds true .",
