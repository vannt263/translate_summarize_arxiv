    "symanzik s improvement program@xcite applied to on - shell quantities@xcite attempts to eliminate cut - off dependence order by order by an expansion in powers of the lattice spacing @xmath1 . in order to improve the wilson quark action to @xmath0 in lattice qcd",
    ", this requires adding the @xmath0 `` clover '' term @xcite .",
    "quark operators also have to be modified by @xmath0 counter terms , which generally involve new operators of higher dimension@xcite . in perturbation theory ,",
    "the tree - level value of the clover coefficient and those of the counter terms of quark operators are sufficient to remove terms of @xmath2 in on - shell green s functions evaluated at one - loop level@xcite .",
    "however there still remains @xmath3 terms and new counter terms are needed to eliminate them @xcite .",
    "the domain - wall fermion formulation was originally proposed by kaplan@xcite to define lattice chiral gauge theories with the introduction of many heavy regulator fields as an extension of the wilson fermion .",
    "this original idea and the later work about the chern - simons currents@xcite is further developed by shamir@xcite into a simpler form and is applied to lattice qcd ( dwqcd ) anticipating superior features over other quark formulations : no need of the fine tuning to realize the chiral limit and no restriction for the number of flavors .",
    "recent simulation results seem to support the former feature non - perturbatively@xcite .",
    "it is also perturbatively shown that the massless mode at the tree level still remains stable against the quantum correction@xcite . in spite of the existence of the wilson term in the action",
    "it does not directly affect the mass term ; there is no additive mass correction .    related to this good chiral property and disappearance of additive mass correction from the wilson term the dwqcd",
    "is expected to have no next leading @xmath0 errors .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite with an intuitive discussion of good chirality that the leading discretization errors are @xmath4 and there is no @xmath0 errors .",
    "they also argue that the scaling behavior of numerical results for @xmath5@xcite and strange quark mass@xcite are consistent with this nature .",
    "for the two dimensional gross - neveu model it is reported in ref.@xcite that the physical observables do not have @xmath0 errors by a nonperturbative analysis of the effective potential at large @xmath6 limit .    although the lattice axial symmetry was discovered@xcite for the dirac operator which satisfy the ginsparg - wilson relation@xcite @xmath7 and it was shown to exist in the effective theory of dwqcd@xcite , disappearance of @xmath0 term is not necessarily trivial .",
    "because the lattice axial transformation of lscher type contains @xmath0 term within the transformation itself , @xmath8 and the operators with exact chirality is given by using the projection @xmath9 this projected operator can be written in terms of the boundary fermion field of the dwqcd @xmath10@xcite , where the boundary fields are given by @xmath11 and are transformed under the axial transformation ( [ eqn : axial - tr ] ) as @xmath12 in the context of the dwqcd , where the exact axial symmetry does not exist because of infinite number of `` unphysical '' fermion fields , the chirality of the operator is understood by the axial ward - takahashi identity given by furman and shamir with an appropriately defined axial transformation@xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an axial current , @xmath15 is a pseudo scalar density and @xmath16 is an explicit breaking term .",

    "@xcite that the exact axial ward - takahashi identity is satisfied for boundary quark operators in the infinite flavor limit , @xmath17 the above operator @xmath10 transforms in the same way as in the continuum under the transformation and the exact chirality can be given in order to keep the identity .",
    "although the axial ward - takahashi identity is shown to be realized nonperturbatively for a well behaved gauge field configuration@xcite , it is still interesting to see the perturbative understanding of this good chirality , especially the disappearance of the @xmath0 terms since we can see the operator mixing structure definitely .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the lattice artifacts in loop correction perturbatively for dwqcd with infinite width of fifth dimensional direction .",
    "we show that there appear no @xmath0 errors in renormalization factors of quark wave function , mass and quark bilinear operators at one and two loop level .",
    "although our instrument is perturbation theory our proof is based on even or oddness of the quantum correction in terms of dimensionful quantity such as the quark external momentum and mass , and it can be generally extended to any loop level .",
    "we notice that we need not to set the external quark momentum to the on - shell value to eliminate the @xmath0 errors as in the case of the wilson fermion with clover term .",

    "each internal line propagators contain damping factors @xmath61 , @xmath63 and consideration of even - odd structure is carried for left and right hand side of fermion line independently .",
    "there is one fermion interaction vertex @xmath122 in each fermion lines of ( [ eqn : tq ] ) and flip of even - odd structure occurs once .",
    "this gives odd functions , @xmath155[r_s\\eta_o+l_s\\eta_e]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the left side line and @xmath156[r_t\\xi_e - l_t\\eta_o]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for right side one making the total contribution even .    for two loop diagrams ,",
    "we consider fig .",
    "[ 2-loop_cur](a ) as an example .",
    "there are two interaction vertices @xmath122 in each fermion line , where the even - odd flip occurs twice giving odd contribution .",
    "therefore , the total contribution from the multiplication of them becomes even as expected .",
    "the above argument is valid for all other remaining two loop diagrams .",
    "for example estimation of diagrams in fig .",

    "in this article , we made an estimation of the lattice artifacts in loop correction perturbatively for dwqcd in @xmath28 limit .",
    "we studied quantum corrections to the green function constructed from the physical quark field only .",
    "we revealed the even - odd structure of the diagrams in terms of the external quark momentum and mass .    with the help of the damping factors in the external quark propagator , we have shown to two loop level that the quark self - energy is definitely odd and the effective vertex of the quark bilinear operator is even .",
    "this means that the quark self - energy has neither additive mass correction nor @xmath0 errors , and @xmath0 errors in the effective vertex of the quark bilinear operator vanish automatically .",
    "since our discussion can be extended to any loop diagram , we can show that @xmath0 errors do not appear for any diagram at any loop level in the same way .",
    "this is because the disappearance of them is deeply concerned with the hidden axial symmetry@xcite of the dwqcd which was explicitly shown to exist in ref .",
