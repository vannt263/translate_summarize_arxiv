    "free space perception , without any prior knowledge , is still a challenging issue in mobile robotics .",
    "contributions to this challenge are numerous and typically used telemetric sensors , such as sonars or laser , to get an immediate perception of the objects depth and avoid collisions .",
    "recent approaches use rather vision and mainly stereovision @xcite , in which visual cues permit to recover this depth estimation .",
    "only few contributions @xcite consider monocular vision approaches .",
    "they however made strong assumptions on the camera motion and mostly required a metric or a topological knowledge of the environment to correctly perform the segmentation .",
    "here , we investigate the use of active contours and monocular omnidirectional vision as a framework within which to realize real - time omnidirectional free space approximations in unknown environments . we propose a new approach to contour parametrization and evolution based on free form deformation .",
    "besides the benefit of offering a wide field of view , omnidirectional vision helps the initialization of contour propagation , that is a common problem in such approaches .",
    "contour extraction schemes based on deformable models are commonly and efficiently used in image segmentation .",
    "they can be classified as either parametric @xcite or geometric ( variational ) active contours @xcite depending on the contour representation and its dynamic of propagation .",
    "the parametric active contours are explicit active contour models whose deformation is constrained by minimization of a functional energy under a lagrangian formulation .",
    "in contrast , the variational methods consider implicit representation of the contour as the level sets of two dimensional distance functions which evolve according to an eulerian formulation .",
    "the seminal paper on active contours @xcite considers parametric models .",
    "this spawned many variations and extensions for energy formulations and contour dynamics @xcite in many imaging problems , including edge detection @xcite , shape modeling @xcite and motion tracking @xcite to mention only few .",
    "whatever energy formulation @xcite , the main concern is to ensure convergence of the contour to boundary concavities of the segmented object .",
    "variational based contours@xcite reformulate the contour evolution in the context of pde - driven surfaces and geometric flows .",
    "they overcome contour convergence in boundary concavities and allow to automatically handle topology changes of the contour using the level set framework .",
    "the approach proved to be efficient in a wide range of domains such as fluid dynamics or computer vision @xcite but with a prohibitive computational cost .",
    "the latter prevents these methods to be used in real time applications even with efficient numerical techniques as the fast marching methods @xcite .",
    "later , the authors @xcite proposed a geodesic approach that allows to connect classical active contours based on energy minimization with geometric active contours based on the theory of curve evolution .",
    "close to this work is @xcite which proposed piecewise regular contour models mixing spline functions and global minimization @xcite or snaxels constrained motion @xcite .",
    "this work proposes a novel class of active contours that unifies piecewise regular contour models and curve evolution based on free form deformation .",
    "it develops a new and fast technique for active contour parametrization and evolution .",
    "the active contour representation is given by parametric bzier curve patches .",
    "these patches are referred to as free - form curves which suggest that they can be locally deformed with the flexibility and smoothness of bzier curves of an arbitrary order .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is to define the free form deformation setup for active contour parametrization and propagation .",
    "the approach can adapt to various shape settings and handle topology changes of the active contour with almost a linear complexity .",
    "the linear complexity of our algorithms is upset only in case of topology change and is bounded in all cases by @xmath0 ) ( @xmath1 the number of the bzier patches composing the active contour ) . a second contribution of the paper consists in using the free form based active contours framework for free space segmentation and safe navigation of a robot using catadioptric omnidirectional vision only .",
    "while the success of classical active contour models mostly depends on the initial contour locations with respect to the object to be segmented , the geometric properties of omnidirectional vision allows to encapsulate the initial contour without any prior knowledge on the shape or extent of the free space .",
    "a comparative study with recent work based on parametric and geometric models , validates the approach for real time free space segmentation and navigation in unknown and large environments .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec.ff ] recalls some basic notions about bzier curves interpolation and more advanced concepts on free form deformation that will be used in active contour evolution .",
    "the latter is introduced in section  [ sec.ffac ] as well as some geometric operations allowing contour convergence and fitting to complex shapes and topology changes .",
    "section  [ sec.results ] gives results , first in case of simplified synthetic images to illustrate the proposed method , and then in real world robot experiments that is a more advanced and challenging setting for the method assessment .",
    "it is evaluated on images acquired by a mobile robot exploring unknown indoor and outdoor environments and compared to state - of - the - art geometric and parametric models .",
    "comparative work @xcite is used as a baseline for performance evaluation both in terms of processing time and contour convergence .",
    "finally , section  [ sec.conclu ] concludes this study and draws some future work .",
    "this section provides the material and basic tools needed for the free form modeling and deformation of active contours .",

    "remark that for a given fixed subdivision @xmath37 of the interval @xmath22 $ ] , the computation of the inverse mapping @xmath38 is to be performed only once ( and offline ) in the initialization .",
    "so , the computational cost of the interpolation at degree @xmath2 is given by the following lemma :    [ cost1 ] assuming a @xmath37 fixed partition , the cost of interpolation by a bzier curve of degree @xmath2 is the cost of multiplications of a @xmath39 square matrix by two @xmath40-dimensional vectors .",
    "the related cost is in @xmath41 and is constant for a fixed @xmath2 .",
    "let now consider a local deformation of the bzier curve points ( fig .",
    "[ fig.deform ] ) .",
    "the new curve is defined to be the resulting deformed control points correspondingly to the following proposition .",
    "[ prop.deformpatch ] let @xmath42 be a perturbation of the points @xmath43 , then the control points of the bzier curve going through @xmath44 at @xmath25 are given by    @xmath45     +    the same remark as for curve interpolation holds , the matrix @xmath38 can be computed only once .",
    "the following lemma is a direct consequence of the remark :    [ cost2 ] the cost of deformation of the control polygon of a bzier curve of degree @xmath2 can be computed with the cost of multiplications of a @xmath39 square matrix by two @xmath40-dimensional vectors and so has cost @xmath46 .",
    "bzier curves have several advantages but carry the rigidity of polynomial curves .",
    "in order to increase geometric possibilities , we can connect together bzier curves .",

    "an active contour will be expressed as a set of @xmath47 linked continuous bzier curves of the same order @xmath2 where the @xmath48 curve is connected to the first one ( a closed form ) .",
    "each bzier curve defines a patch of the active contour ; the latter being noted @xmath49 with @xmath50 a patch number , and called a free form active contour .",

    "note that @xmath59 is the parameter that controls the distance ratio along interpolation : as it varies between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the entire curve could be generated .    from definition",
    ", we get an efficient way to compute and evaluate the parametrization of a free form using the de casteljau algorithm for each patch of the active contour .",
    "the regularity of bzier curves brings an intrinsic smoothness to the active contour ( continuous and differentiable everywhere but to a finite set of points ) .",
    "one can add constraints so as to maintain higher cross - boundary derivative continuity .",
    "the latter is not considered here since we did not use them in our experiments but should be explored in future works .",
    "classical parametric formulation of active contour models defines internal and external forces to evolve the contour .",
    "the external forces derive from image features whereas internal forces ensure smoothness and regularity constraints on the contour propagation . in the proposed work ,",
    "the formulation is simplified by using free form deformation models .",
    "indeed , it is not necessary to include regularization constraints as they are intrinsically derived from bzier curves .",
    "the contour evolution is induced by local deformations of some selected points on the free form curves composing the patches of the active contour .",
    "a local deformation @xmath62 at a selected contour point @xmath63 is only derived from a pressure force and a gradient edge map of the image .",
    "the edge map is defined such that it has large values only in the immediate neighborhood of edges , almost zero values in homogeneous regions and that the gradient vectors are pointing toward and are normal to the edges .",
    "it could be obtained using canny edge detector @xcite .",
    "this defines a computational diffusion process ( eq .  ) in the image to attract free forms to regions boundaries . the active free form contour is then attracted to edges or terminations .",
    "@xmath64 where @xmath65 is a gaussian smoothing of image @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    a balloon force ( similarly to @xcite )",
    "is defined a pressure force and is used to move the contour in the normal direction to the bzier curve defining each contour patch .",
    "its effect is defined only in the homogenous domains of the gradient edge map . in our method , we take benefit of the closed form expression of bzier curves to compute normal vectors at the selected contour points .",
    "this is achieved by computing ( only once ) the second derivative of the interpolation equation ; that is easy since the control points are constants which reduces to the computation of the derivatives of bernstein s polynomials .",
    "note that with some simple algebraic manipulations , the control points of bzier derivative curves can be obtained immediately and can be computed at the same time with bzier curves using de casteljau algorithm .",
    "each point @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) of a contour patch @xmath70 is thus moved to a new position following the normal direction to the contour with a gradient function velocity .",
    "control points @xmath71 $ ] of each patch @xmath70 at the new position are then obtained from equation , which in turn , define the entire bzier curve parametrizing the new position of each active contour patch .",
    "the process is repeated until convergence ( see free form algorithms below ) .",
    "note that the evolution of the active contour depends only on the evolution of these points , whereas its regularity is maintained during propagation by the smoothness properties of bzier curves mapping .",
    "the initially defined active contour is composed of @xmath47 patches each of them of degree @xmath2 . the contour expands to meet free space boundaries , but depending on the patches resolution , it could prevent from suitably converging in concave or convex areas .",
    "considering that no model nor knowledge is given on the shape or extent of the free space , we make the number of patches dynamically evolve with active contour deformation .",
    "this is locally achieved by constraining the distance between adjacent points of the patches and inserting new patches where it is needed .",
    "we consider here the case of contour expansion .",
    "the insertion test is based on the maximal distance separating control points of the same patch : if it is above a fixed distance threshold , the patch is split into two different patches of the same degree @xmath2 as the initial one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.split ] which illustrates the cubic patches case ) .",
    "the latter are generated by uniformly resampling the initial bzier curve in @xmath72 points @xmath73 using de casteljau algorithm , then interpolating each set of points @xmath74 and @xmath75 to compute the respective control points of the new patches .    .",

    "the test and the split are depicted in algorithm  [ algo.split ] .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , we will make the assumption that the patches intersect properly , it is to say that the patches as two intersection points , each intersection being the proper intersection of two segments of each control polygon .",

    "if the enclosing boxes have a non - empty intersection , it does not mean that there is mandatory an intersection of the control polygon , neither of the curves . here , we will describe algorithms for the case of patches of degree 3 .",
    "there is two main motivations for that .",
    "firstly , degree 3 is rich enough from the geometric point of view .",
    "secondly , the algorithm for degree 3 patches is easy to understand and to describe while it is hard to give a completely general algorithm for the general case .",

    "the structural test allows to eliminate false obstacle candidates in the robot surroundings and thus extends its free space perception to relevant free space terminations .",
    "to validate the interest of the free form method within the active contours framework , we discuss in the following its performance in comparison with traditional active contour approaches .",
    "the latter are based on energy minimization @xcite or on resolution of an implicit variational scheme @xcite .",
    "parametric active contours that by minimization deform on the domain according to the influence of internal and external forces , are very efficient with regard to processing time but are not ( or rarely ) able to handle topology changes .",
    "geometric active contours that express optimal contour deformation as a solution of a partial differential equation , are topologically flexible , but are not time efficient though some numerical techniques have been developed @xcite to make the level set numerically robust and efficient .",
    "work @xcite adapted and compared the energy minimizing and level set methods for finding adequate approximations of visual free space in images .",
    "we extend this comparative work to free from representation of active contours and will show that it combines advantages of both parametric and geometric methods .",
    "a parametric active contour is a curve defined parametrically by @xmath169 and moved such that it minimizes an energy functional : @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 denote respectively the internal energy of regularization and the external energy derived from the image .",
    "different energy formulations and the underlying force fields driving the active contour have been proposed .",
    "examples include balloon and pressure force model @xcite , distance transform force model @xcite and gradient vector flow model @xcite .",
    "the active contour model for free space segmentation developed in @xcite is an iterative parametric method able to handle a real - time omnidirectional free space approximation where the problem of falsely classified obstacles is solved thanks to a new functional energy formulation .",
    "the latter considers a local test based on the intuitive idea that the observation by a robot of two successive free space terminations in the same direction is congruous only if the first observed termination belongs to false obstacles .",
    "the external energy ( eq .  ) includes an altitude function of matched interest points ( using harris detector ) in the vicinity of the moving interface and superposes their altitude to the edge map generated by canny edge detector . if two keypoints of zero altitude are successively located in a small radial zone normal to the contour propagation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.triangul]-(d ) ) , the contour continues its evolution over the first edge considered as a virtual obstacle .",

    "@xmath158 is the altitude function with @xmath159 threshold of obstacle - passing .",
    "the proposed model also includes dynamic geometric refinement based on a cost distance function that allows the contour to deform and adapt to large or more complex shapes .",
    "geometric active contours are alternative models to parametric contours , based on the fundamental concept of level set methods .",
    "the latter specify the active contour in an implicit form function which evolution is modeled by the hamilton - jacobi nonlinear equation .",
    "@xmath176 where @xmath177 is the implicit scalar function on domain @xmath178 with initial condition @xmath179 representing the initial front @xmath180 .",
    "the normal speed @xmath181 of the moving interface is determined from the shape gradients .",
    "approximate numerical solutions to the stationary variational scheme ( where @xmath146 is monotone in ) have been efficiently produced using fast marching techniques @xcite .",
    "the latter concentrate the scheme resolution only in a small neighborhood of the front to avoid useless computations .",
    "this is done by dividing the discrete domain into three subsets : far nodes , accepted nodes , and narrow band nodes .",
    "the narrowband nodes are the nodes lying in the neighborhood of the deforming contour and where a solution is actually computed .",
    "the accepted nodes are those already traversed by the front and where an approximate solution was previously evaluated ( their values can not change ) .",
    "the far nodes are the remaining nodes not yet reached by the propagating front and where no approximate solution was ever estimated .",
    "work @xcite added a new category of nodes , labelled _ potentially on contour _ nodes , which are located in the narrow band and its immediate neighboring with the following property : when a narrow band point is accepted , if its neighboring points are on edges ( i.e. @xmath146 is close to zero in these points ) , they are considered as potentially on contour nodes and the front stops its propagation at these points .      the experimental protocol consists in guiding a mobile robot to explore indoor and outdoor urban environments , and to extract the visual free space using the active contour models presented in the previous section and the free form model proposed in this paper .",
    "the results are assessed with respect to the final shape of the free space terminations and time convergence .",
    "figure  [ fig.comp1 ] shows quite similar results in free spaces of simple shapes with an improvement of the final shape smoothness in the level set and free form models due to the intrinsic regularity of , respectively , the level set solution and bzier parametrization .",
    "note that the regularization weighting parameters of the internal energies have been manually tuned and optimized at the initial state on a set of test images .",
    "the latter do not seem , as we could expect , sufficient to maintain curve smoothness in spaces of arbitrary shapes .        in more complex environments ( fig .",
    "[ fig.comp2 ] and [ fig.comp3 ] ) yielding topology changes , the free form and level set models highly outperform the parametric one .",
    "an intrinsic behavior of geometric deformable models is the ability to handle topology changes .",
    "the latter are also automatically considered in the free from model including the intersection test .",
    "though the optimized parametric model @xcite integrates local false obstacle detections , a single closed contour can hardly manage situations with large spurious free space terminations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.comp2 ] .",
    "the behavior of the parametric model is most dependent on the presence and distribution of interest points near the contour .",
    "a lack of interest points extracted prevents disambiguate the entire junction .",
    "note however that no semantics of objects is present for the robot .",
    "so if the objects are too close to walls so that the robot can not see behind the object , they can not be isolated and enclosed by the free form method .",
    "they will be considered as free space termination regardless of their altitude .",
    "finally , we consider the computational cost of the proposed free form method and compare it with that of the parametric and level set methods . table  [ tab.comp ] shows comparative results with respect to the processing time of the algorithms .",
    "the active contours were implemented using _",
    "matlab _ and _ c / c++ _ for real - time robot perception and navigation .",
    "each method parameters were optimized to give optimal performance of the final segmented shape of the free space .",
    "our experiments indicate that ( a ) the representation of the final shape of the free space is better with level set and free space models , and ( b ) the time elapsed is almost similar for the parametric and free form models whereas it increases significantly with the level set model .",
    "this processing time of the free form model improves in environments of simple shapes with time gain of order 2 ( respectively 4 ) relatively to parametric ( respectively level set ) model .",
    "the free form algorithm is almost linear with respect to the number of patches .",
    "the main computational cost of the free form method is to sort the patches of the contour ( which cost is @xmath182 with @xmath47 the total number of contour patches ) but this is done only at the initialization and after each topology changes .",
    ".typical original input images of simple ( _ top _ ) and complex ( _ bottom _ ) environments are shown on the left .",
    "pm , ls and ff stand for respectively parametric , level set and free form models of the active contour .",
    "note that _",
    "i ) _ the level set method requires a large number of initial points for the validity of the finite difference scheme approximation ; and _ ii ) _ it moves one point at each iteration , while the other two methods move the entire contour at each iteration .",

    "this paper presented a fast technique for active contours based on free form modeling and deformation .",
    "it was applied to visual free space segmentation using omnidirectional imagery from a catadioptric monocular system with the aim of achieving robot autonomous exploration and navigation in unknown environments .",
    "the proposed method can easily adapt to complex free space shapes that can form holes , split to form multiple boundaries , or merge with other boundaries to form a single surface .",
