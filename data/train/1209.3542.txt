    "during the past two decades the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method has emerged as a competitive scheme for simulating various nearly incompressible complex flows @xcite , ranging from magnetohydrodynamics chensy - prl-1991,cicp-2008 , to flows of suspensions @xcite , flows with phase separation @xcite , flows through porous media @xcite , etc . with increasing the mach number ,",
    "the compressibility of flow becomes more pronounced .",
    "such high speed compressible flows are ubiquitous in explosion physics , aerophysics and astrophysics , etc . up to now",
    ", the lb modeling and simulating of compressible flows , especially those with shocks and/or discontinuities , is still a challenging issue .",
    "given the great importance of shocking and detonation in many fields of physics and engineering @xcite , constructing lb models for high speed compressible flows has been attempted since the early days of lb research succi - book . to proceed ,",
    "we first discuss the most fundamental problem what is lb ? .",
    "the views are not exactly the same in papers by different authors . since having different knowledge backgrounds and working in different fields , different authors may use lb to solve different problems and focus on different sides of lb .",
    "understandably , even for the same author , the views will be updated with extending research experience .",
    "globally speaking , the views on lb can be classified into two categories .",
    "the first category regards lb as a new scheme for simulating hydrodynamic equations such as the euler equations and navier - stokes equations .",
    "the second category regards lb as a kind of new model of physical systems .",
    "physical model construction and numerical method design are the first two steps for numerical study on any physical problems . compared with numerical methods ,",
    "the physical model construction is the first step and more fundamental . only after the physical model",
    "is fixed can the corresponding numerical method be established . clearly , the first kind of view starts lb research from the second step , numerical method design .",
    "it does not consider the improvements of the physical modeling .",
    "in other words , it assumes that the original hydrodynamic equations are sufficiently exact for modeling the problem under consideration .",
    "the second kind of view puts lb research on the more fundamental step , physical modeling .",
    "for this view the numerical method is the second important issue .",
    "it accepts any reasonable numerical methods no matter they are new or traditional .",
    "the second kind of view aims at physical problems .",
    "the point of the second view is that , compared with the traditional hydrodynamic equations , the lb framework contains more physical components .",
    "the theoretical reasons are as below .",
    "the lb model is based on the boltzmann equation which is one of the most fundamental equations in non - equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "it naturally inherits some intrinsic characteristics of the latter . according to the chapman - enskog analysis",
    ", one can expand the distribution function around its equilibrium as taylor series in the knudsen number .",
    "when the knudsen number approaches zero , the system is nearly in equilibrium state , the deviation from equilibrium is negligible , the lb model corresponds to or recovers the euler equations .",
    "when the first order terms in knudsen number have to be accounted and the second order terms are negligible , in other words , when the system slightly deviates from the equilibrium , the lb model corresponds to or recovers the navier - stokes equations .",
    "when the system deviates more from equilibrium and the second order terms in knudsen number have to be taken into account , the lb model is beyond the navier - stokes description .",
    "the theoretical framework of lb is self - adaptive for describing complex systems where the deviations from equilibrium are spatially and temporally varying .",
    "from the view of modeling precision on detailed dynamics , it is less than molecular dynamics(md ) .",
    "it adopts the concept of distribution function .",
    "it is generally considered as a kind of mesoscopic modeling . for continuum system",
    ", the lb should give the same results as those of hydrodynamics equations .",
    "for non - continuum systems such as the boundary layers where the knudsen number is high , the lb should give the same results as those of other mature methods such as md or monte carlo(mc ) . in between the two kinds of limiting cases , the hydrodynamic equations are not valid ,",
    "the md and mc are reasonable but not practical due to the huge quantity of computations . for such cases , the lb modeling and simulation still work .",
    "its results should be checked by physical principles and analyses . just as in traditional computational fluid dynamics(cfd ) where different discretization schemes work for different problems , for different systems one should compose or choose different lb models .    in 1992",
    "alexander et al @xcite proposed a compressible lb model where the main skill is to introduce a flexible sound speed so that the mach number may become higher .",
    "this model works only for nearly isothermal compressible systems . in 1999",
    "yan et al @xcite proposed a lb scheme for compressible euler equations . in this model a discrete velocity model(dvm ) with three energy levels is used .",
    "sun et al @xcite proposed an adaptive lb model where the particle velocities vary with the mach number and internal energy .",
    "the model partly frees the particle velocity from fixed values .",
    "it works for more extensive systems compared with previous lb versions .",
    "its two - dimensional and three - dimensional versions were published in 1998 and 2003 , respectively .",
    "the evolutions of all those models follow the traditional propagation + collision  mode .",
    "all of them belong to the standard lb models . due to the inconvenience of application and/or numerical instability problems , few physical results based on those models",
    "can be found .    for modeling and simulating compressible flows ,",
    "an alternative way is to use the finite - difference(fd)-lb method .",
    "tsutahara group kataoka2004a , kataoka2004b , watari2003,watari2004,watari2007 in kobe university proposed several fd - lb models in recent years .",
    "the fd - lb model frees the combination of spatial and temporal discretizations .",
    "the sizes of particle velocities are flexible .",
    "so it is much more convenient to meet the requirements for simulating compressible fluids .",
    "the fd - lb scheme was then extended to the case of binary fluids @xcite . but numerical instability problem blocks its practical applications to systems with a mach number being larger than @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , as for the numerical instability problem , many attempts have been made .",
    "typical examples are referred to the entropy lb model @xcite , fix - up scheme @xcite , flux - limters approach@xcite , etc .",
    "but most of the discussions were still focused on systems with small mach numbers .    to model and",
    "simulate high speed compressible flows , especially those with shocks , our group developed two schemes in recent years .",
    "the first is to introduce additional viscosity and improve the discretization of spatial and temporal derivatives xupan2007,xugan2008physa , xugan2008ctp , xuchen2009,xuchen2010,xugan2011ctp .",
    "this scheme does not change the framework of the original lb model .",
    "the second is to develop multiple relaxation time(mrt ) lb models mrt2011pla , mrt2010epl , mrt2011ctp , xuchen2011,mrt2011taml .",
    "the framework is changed in the second scheme .",
    "the first scheme is based on the following facts .",
    "( i ) the numerical fluid particles do not distinguish the original viscosity and additional viscosity .",
    "( ii ) introducing additional viscosity is equivalent to modifying the relaxation time from some sense .",
    "( iii ) better template of discretization may damp the numerical anisotropy .",
    "our improved models work for both high speed and low speed flows .",
    "so , they make it possible to simulate stable shocks in compressible fluids .",
    "the first scheme is based on the original bhatnagar - gross - krook(bgk ) model .",
    "it is a remedy under the original framework .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we first introduce a few improved lb models based on the first scheme in section ii .",
    "the mrt scheme is reviewed in section iii .",
    "section iv shows two typical applications , lb studies on richtmyer - meshkov(rm ) and kelvin - helmhotz(kh ) instabilities .",
    "section v summarizes the present paper .",
    "among the two - dimensional fd - lb models for compressible flows , the one by kataoka and tsutahara @xcite is typical .",
    "it has very simple and strict theoretical background , uses a dvm with only @xmath1 components .",
    "the specific heat ratio is flexible .",
    "but the numerical instability blocks its application in supersonic flows .",
    "therefore , our first lb model for high speed compressible flows is created by improving the kataoka - tsutahara(kt ) model .",

    "consequently , the prandtl number is changed to @xmath100    figure 4 shows a validation example of such a scheme for flexible prandtl numbers based on the srt model .",
    "the figure shows the comparison of lb results with theoretical solutions for thermal couette flows .",
    "fig.(a ) is for the temperature profiles in steady state for various prandtl numbers .",
    "fig.(b ) shows the velocity profiles for @xmath101 at various times . for more details the readers can refer to ref . @xcite .",
    "such a scheme makes a significant remedy from the side of physical modeling .",
    "it is easy to find that such a scheme can also be used to change other transport coefficients such as the viscosity .",
    "it is also meaningful to mention that among the moment relations required by each lb model , only for the three , the definitions of density , momentum and energy , the equilibrium distribution function @xmath4 can be replaced by the distribution function @xmath3 . if we replace @xmath4 by @xmath3 in rhs of any other required moment relations , the value of rhs will have a deviation from that of the left hand side .",
    "this deviation may work as a measure for the deviation of system from its equilibrium .",
    "for example , the following @xmath102 @xmath103presents a measure for how much the system deviates from its equilibrium for cases without using the constraint @xmath104 .",
    "it is known that different motion modes generally approach their equilibria in different velocities .",
    "but in the srt bgk model , the speeds of all discrete distribution functions approaching the equilibria are determined by a single relaxation time @xmath17 .",
    "that means @xmath17 is an averaged relaxation time of all kinds of motion modes .",
    "the best merit of this treatment is that it is simple and keeps the most fundamental conservation laws .",
    "this bgk model has been successfully applied in various fields . but with increasing the mach number and reynolds number , the problem of numerical instability becomes more serious . at the same time , the prandtl number effect is a key issue in many fluidic systems . facing with all these requirements and challenges , people began to reevaluate this simple averaging treatment .",
    "the numerical instability of lb simulation is still a difficult problem nowadays .",
    "roughly speaking , the possible reasons come from two sides , the physical modeling and the discretization scheme .",
    "it has been indicated that untying the motion modes which should be independent is helpful for improving the numerical stability @xcite .",
    "succi , et al @xcite , luo , et al @xcite and many others have made significant contributions in constructing mrt lb models .",
    "those mrt models are mainly within the framework of the standard lb model and work for isothermal systems with low mach number . in recent years our group proposed two schemes to compose mrt model for high speed compressible flows .",
    "these schemes are for the framework of the fd - lb model .",
    "the finished works focus still on the two - dimensional cases .    in the mrt lb formulation ,",
    "the collision step is first calculated in the kinetic moment space spanned by a suitable set of @xmath10 kinetic moments of the distribution function @xmath3 .",
    "then , the propagation step is performed back in the discrete velocity space spanned by the @xmath10 discrete velocities @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast to the srt model , the mrt version caters for more adjustable parameters and degrees of freedom .",
    "the relaxation rates of the various kinetic moments due to particle collisions may be adjusted independently .",
    "the mrt lb equation has the following form , @xmath106 \\text { , } \\label{1}\\]]where @xmath107 is the collision matrix .",
    "the equation reduces to the usual lattice bgk equation if all the relaxation parameters are set to be a single relaxation time @xmath17 , namely @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the identity matrix .",
    "the discrete distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be rewritten as the following matrixes :    @xmath110    @xmath111    where @xmath27 is the transpose operator .",
    "given a set of discrete velocities @xmath112 and corresponding distribution functions @xmath3 , we can get a velocity space @xmath113 spanned by discrete velocities @xmath5 and a moment space @xmath114 spanned by moments of particle distribution function @xmath115 .",
    "the moments of particle distribution function reads @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , @xmath118 is an element of the matrix @xmath119 and is a polynomial of discrete velocities .",
    "obviously , the moments are simply linear combination of distribution functions@xmath120 , and the mapping between moment space and velocity space is defined by the linear transformation @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 .    since the collision step is first calculated in the moment space and then mapped back to the velocity space .",
    "so , the mrt lb equation can be described as @xmath124where @xmath125 is a diagonal relaxation matrix .",
    "@xmath126  is the equilibrium value of the moment @xmath127 .",
    "the moments can be divided into two groups .",

    "it is clear that the first group includes the density , the momentum and the energy .",
    "now we briefly review the first mrt lb model proposed in our group mrt2011pla .",

    "the rayleigh - taylor(rt ) instability , richtmyer - meshkov(rm ) instability and kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability are highly concerned in weapon physics and inertial confinement fusion .",
    "for example , during the spherical implosion procedure , the high pressure applied at the outside of the shell drives a very strong shock wave towards the centre of the device .",
    "this shock wave first accelerates the interface to a high velocity . towards the end of the implosion",
    "the interface is decelerated by a combination of shock waves reflected from the center of the device and continuous deceleration due to build up of high pressure in the thermonuclear material .",
    "such a very complicated acceleration / deceleration behavior results in two processes , rt instability and rm instability .",
    "since the implosion is generally not perfectly symmetrical , the shear at the interface induces the third process , kh instability .",
    "hydrodynamic instabilities in such procedure influence significantly the implosion physics and weapon performance . in this section ,",
    "we summarize our recent attempts on lb simulations on kh lb2khi2011 and rm instabilities @xcite .",
    "when studying the rm instability , the system must be compressible . in the case of kh instability ,",
    "the system can be compressible or nearly incompressible .",
    "as a first step , we attempted the case with nearly incompressible fluids .",
    "the rm instability arises when a shock wave interacts with an interface separating two different fluids .",
    "it combines various compressible phenomena , such as shock interaction and refraction , with hydrodynamic instability , including nonlinear growth and subsequent transition to turbulence , across a wide range of mach numbers . in inertial confinement fusion",
    ", the rm instability causes mixing between the capsule material and the fuel within , limiting final compression and thus the ability to achieve energy break - even or production .",
    "the rm instability problems in the plane occur when a shock wave travels from a light medium to a heavy one or when the shock wave travels from a heavy medium to a light one .",

    "initially , the two media have the same pressure and different densities and temperatures . the corresponding mach number of the shock wave traveling from left is @xmath195 .",
