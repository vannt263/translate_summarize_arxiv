    "one of the key questions which remains in the understanding of the unusual superconductors , like the high - t@xmath1-materials , some heavy fermion compounds or organic superconductors is connected with the unusual short coherence length of the cooper pairs . even without having clarity on the microscopic pairing mechanism and on the evolution of a superconducting phase by e.g. doping an antiferromagnetic insulator with holes , this short ranged pair formation points towards an effective strong electron ",
    "electron interaction .",
    "it is therefore essential to get a deeper understanding especially of the thermodynamic properties and of finite temperature quantities of the electron gas with a strong attractive interaction . from the theoretical understanding the electron gas with an attractive interaction has  besides the atomic one  only two well understood limits .",
    "the first one is the weak coupling three dimensional ( 3d ) case . in this case",
    "no two  particle bound state has the ability to empty the one  particle continuum and the bcs instability can occur for pairs with zero total momentum at the fermi surface .",
    "bcs  superconductivity of weakly bound pairs with large coherence lengths occurs .",
    "these pairs simultaneously establish pair formation and phase coherence of the bcs wave - function .",
    "the second limit which is well understood is the two  particle problem which gives the zero density limit . solving the two  particle problem in one and two dimensions leads for any strength of the attractive interaction to the formation of a bound state .",
    "since a pair of electrons can be regarded as a boson , the trapping of a pair in the bound state can be understood as a `` t=0 condensation '' of a boson into the bound state .",
    "solving the two  particle problem in three and more dimensions leads to a clear criterion to distinguish between the weak and strong coupling limits . in 3d",
    "there exists a critical strength of the attractive interaction below which no bound state occurs .",
    "this marks the weak coupling regime where at finite densities the bcs instability will occur . above the critical coupling strength",
    "the pair of electrons condenses into the bound state .",
    "the simplest model hamiltonian where the crossover from the weak coupling regime towards the stronger coupling limit can be investigated is the hubbard model with a non retarded , attractive , on - site interaction , even though it only shows pairing in the s - wave channel .",
    "a more complicated correlation including next neighbor terms can be included later on where superconducting order parameters can occur which have non spherical symmetries . before extending the hamiltonian we want to understand the crossover for a simple on - site correlation .",
    "an approach has been widely used to which we refer in agreement with many other authors@xcite as t - matrix approach .",
    "it accounts for both of the limits discussed above .",
    "it exactly solves the two electron problem in the center of mass system and therefore gets exact in any dimension and for any strength of the interaction at zero density .",
    "the non  self - consistent t - matrix in the 3d weak coupling case leads to the same equations to determine t@xmath1 as the bcs theory .",
    "the formation of a bcs wave - function can be understood as a macroscopic occupation of a bosonic bound state at the fermi energy by noninteracting pairs .",
    "the bcs gap - parameter is then proportional to the density of pairs in the condensate wave function .",
    "the most problematic part in applying the t - matrix to finite densities and to the stronger coupling limit is that it neglects pair  pair interactions completely in the non  self - consistent formulation@xcite of the theory .",
    "overall , a self - consistent treatment of the two  particle t - matrix seems to compare well with quantum monte carlo results.@xcite however , certain features , like e.g. a pseudogap , are either not reported at all from a self - consistent treatment of the t - matrix@xcite or are not seen in the integrated density of states but only in the k - dependent spectral functions at extreme parameter ranges.@xcite therefore , it is not too surprising that there is a discussion in the literature @xcite on which degree of self - consistency is the right one , which is also motivated by the correct emerging of a superconducting phase at low temperatures . using any degree of self - consistency accounts in some way for pair  pair interactions .",
    "@xcite this is however occurring in a nonsystematic way , since a small parameter is missing .    in this work we want to tackle the question whether there is a systematic way of extending the t - matrix towards the stronger coupling and finite density regime while keeping the complete dynamics of the equations . as a first step towards this goal",
    "we investigate the three particle channel . in the three particle channel",
    "the three body problem is usually decomposed into two - body fragmentation channels , which define a set of lippmann ",
    "schwinger equations . in general",
    ", there are three possible two - body fragmentation channels , i.e. three ways of combining two out of three particles to interact via a two - body force , and a three body interaction . however , for the attractive hubbard model , only two two - body fragmentation channels are left since electrons with identical spin do not interact and an explicit three body interaction is not present .",
    "faddeev @xcite derived a set of coupled equations for the wave functions in momentum space , which include the known solution of the two  particle problem : the two  particle t - matrix .",
    "an equivalent formulation was obtained for the transition amplitudes in the three body scattering problem .",
    "@xcite in this work we follow the same spirit and calculate the three particle t - matrix as an infinite sum over all possible combinations of two  particle t - matrices .",
    "since we are interested in a dynamic instability , we preserve the complete dynamics of the equations in contrast to earlier treatments found in the literature@xcite where one was mainly interested in ground state properties .    in order to be able to do an explicit calculation we use k - averaged quantities .",
    "doing so , we arrive at equations which on one hand become exact in any dimension in the strong coupling limit since in the strong coupling limit all dispersion disappears . on the other hand ,",
    "our equations meet the dynamical mean ",
    "field theory,@xcite which gets exact at infinite dimensions for any coupling strength since the problem can be mapped in infinite dimensions onto a local impurity problem because all correlations become local",
    ". the two  particle t - matrix has been studied in the absence of k - dispersion @xcite and it has been shown that the essential physics of the thouless instability remains intact .",
    "there is however one important difference between the limit of infinite dimensions and the strong coupling case . in infinite dimensions",
    "one clearly has to distinguish between zero momentum and momenta which are non zero.@xcite in the strong coupling limit the k - dispersion vanishes .",
    "therefore it is not necessary to treat k=0",
    "separately.@xcite    in the two  body problem the instability in the particle  particle channel is called ` thouless instability ' .",
    "it is given by the equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the attractive on - site interaction and @xmath4 is the susceptibility in the particle  particle channel .",
    "we show in this paper that in the three particle channel the equivalent of this equation will be given by a determinant of a matrix which becomes zero at the formation of a three particle bound state .",
    "it has been discussed earlier that three particle terms should be included,@xcite although they only lead to logarithmic improvement in 2d @xcite with respect to a low density expansion . however",
    ", a systematic low density expansion should contain the three particle terms as a next step beyond the two  particle t - matrix . in the case of nuclear many body theory the @xmath5-particle as a four particle bound state is of particular low energy and has been discussed by rpke et al.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we derive simplified equations for three particles valid in the hubbard model where electrons with opposite spin do not interact .",
    "the three particles scatter in the vicinity of the fermi surface . in section [ lowdens ]",
    "we show how in a close analogy to an earlier work of gorkov et al .",
    "@xcite the three particle terms can be used to derive a systematic low density  strong coupling extension for the two particle vertex of a pair of electrons with opposite spins . in section [ sec : kaverage ] we apply a k - average and show that the equations reproduce the known results in the two  particle channel .",
    "we pay special attention to keeping the number of matsubara frequencies small which are needed for the calculation .",
    "the analytical extensions to correct the sums over matsubara frequencies are given in appendices .",
    "having established a numerical solution of the two  particle problem which involves only a minimum of matsubara frequencies , we are able to tackle the three particle instability in section [ sec : three ] .",
    "all information on the three particle problem is contained in a six - time correlation function @xmath6 \\rangle \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] where the @xmath7 denote creation and annihilation operators of an electron with spin @xmath8 on the lattice site @xmath9 at imaginary time @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the brackets @xmath11 denote the thermal average and @xmath12 is the time ordering operator . in the first glance it seems to be hopeless to calculate such a correlation function .",
    "however time translational invariance in thermal equilibrium and spatial translational invariance on the lattice reduce the number of independent variables to five . performing all calculations in frequency and momentum space",
    "will further allow via the faddeev equations to solve as well in the  input  as in the  output  channel the occurring two  particle problem by integrating over the relative momentum and energy of a pair .",
    "we therefore arrive at functions for the three particle channel which depend on three dynamical variables only .",
    "it is convenient to chose the total energy and momentum of the triple as one of them .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the three particle terms can be built up by a repeated use of two ",
    "particle interactions.@xcite the special simplification in the case of the attractive hubbard model with only a non retarded , on - site attraction , @xmath13 , is given by the fact that first there is no direct three particle interaction and second that the correlation @xmath3 is only effective between two charge carriers of different spin which are on the same lattice site .",
    "therefore there is only one nontrivial three particle channel where two charge carriers carry a spin @xmath8 and the third one has opposite spin @xmath14 . in the following ,",
    "we use a convenient short hand notation for the combination of summations over matsubara frequencies and @xmath15-space summations .",
    "@xmath16 we use capital greek letters for bosonic and small ones for fermionic matsubara frequencies . using this notation",
    ", the green function of the unperturbed system reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the chemical potential and @xmath8 refers to the spin index which is for our system of electrons ( or holes ) @xmath19 .",
    "the susceptibility in the particle  particle channel for a pair of electrons with opposite spin is @xmath20 the usual two  particle t - matrix results from an infinite geometrical series which results from solving the ( in this case trivially solvable ) bethe  salpeter equation .",
    "@xmath21 this is a vertex function which adds all possible interactions in the particle  particle channel to the usual direct hubbard interaction .",
    "it contains the full solution of the two  particle problem in the center of mass coordinate system and therefore allows the formation of a two  particle bound state if the denominator @xmath22 becomes zero .",
    "this is occurring first at the chemical potential ( @xmath23 ) and for zero total momentum of the pair @xmath24 and defines the thouless criterion for the superconducting instability.@xcite note that we use a different notation for the sign of @xmath25 then in a previous work @xcite which is now in agreement with the book of e.g. schrieffer @xcite but is different from the one used e.g. in ref . .",
    "for later use we define the functions @xmath26 with @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is a two  particle propagator and @xmath29 is the above defined vertex ( [ eq : vertex ] ) without the single interaction between the particles .",
    "the definition of the different @xmath30 will be needed later on to be able e.g. to treat the contribution of the hartree term separately .    following the ideas of faddeev @xcite ,",
    "the three particle terms can be broken up into a two  particle problem plus an additional particle .",
    "therefore , we define the following functions .",
    "@xmath31 this function is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a .",
    "it contains all possible repeated correlations between particle @xmath32 and @xmath33 and contains the propagator for particle @xmath34 which does not interact with any of the other two particles .",
    "@xmath35 is already a part of a fully interacting six - time correlation function .",
    "however the time and spatial translational invariance together with solving the two particle problem in it s center of mass system has in frequency and momentum space reduced the function to an expression which contains only three independent dynamical variables .    the second function which we define is : @xmath36 this function is shown in fig . [ fig : fig2]b . the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the only possible two  body fragmentation channels which are present in the attractive hubbard model .",
    "a repeated application of @xmath38 and @xmath37 turns the frequency @xmath39 into an internal frequency over which a summation has to be performed . a diagrammatic illustration of this term is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "@xmath40 the delta function stems from energy and momentum conservation for a pair .",
    "it is more convenient to introduce a new variable .",
    "this is the total energy ( and momentum ) of all three particles @xmath41 since it is a conserved quantity for the three particle scattering events . in this way",
    "we define @xmath42 note that all the pauli blocking factors which are of importance for the discussion of three body interactions in nuclear matter @xcite are included in the summation over matsubara frequencies due to the analytic properties of thermal green functions .",
    "we can now successively construct all possible interactions among three particles by applying alternate scattering in the only possible two  body fragmentation channels by a repeated application of @xmath43 .",
    "for example applying @xmath43 twice gives one additional internal frequency ( and momentum ) and therefore yields an additional summation .",
    "@xmath44 this defines a formal product for the alternate interaction . in appendix [ app : metrik ]",
    "we show that this formal product can also be written by introducing a metric .",
    "this product can be repeated several times : @xmath45 in the same spirit one can define a neutral element for the product defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prod ] ) . @xmath46 which leads to : @xmath47 it can be seen immediately that the function @xmath48 fulfills all properties of a neutral element with respect to the product defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prod ] ) .",
    "@xmath49 we are now able to express all possible interactions which can occur between three particles in the attractive hubbard model .",
    "this is given by the infinite sum over all the three body interaction terms @xmath50 .",

    "however , restricting the number of matsubara frequencies to a finite number allows to calculate the condition for an instability in the three particle channel .",
    "this is the three particle equivalent of the thouless instability ( [ eq : vertex ] ) which occurs for scattering of two particles .",
    "we like to mention that a general formulation for an arbitrary interaction has been given by ethofer and schuck.@xcite their equations in the p - p - p - channel contain the complete dynamics as our present work does . due to the particular simple interaction of the hubbard model ,",
    "our equations obtain the much simpler form given in this article .    in nuclear physics",
    "@xcite it is often convenient to use simplified formulas for the three  particle t - matrix which depend only on one dynamical variable ( @xmath57 ) instead of an expression which depends on three dynamical variables ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that usually only the dependence on the center of mass ( @xmath59 ) is considered .",
    "such equations are recovered when all internal initial times are set to zero when therefore all internal dynamics of the triple is neglected : @xmath60 in section [ sec : kaverage ] we restrict ourself to an approximation which , as we will show , preserves the main physics and mathematics of the two particle thouless instability together with the complete dynamics of the equations .",
    "afterwards , we are going to show how the physics is altered due to an inclusion of the three particle terms .",
    "in this section we show how the three particle t - matrix can be incorporated to derive a low density strong coupling extension of the equations in the particle  particle channel which lead to the bcs instability . for a continuous system with a non retarded interaction",
    "it has been shown by gorkov and melik - barkhudaev @xcite that a term which is first order in low density ( @xmath61 ) can be used to obtain a low density correction for the two particle instability .",

    "[ fig : fig3rd ] .",
    "@xmath62 the infinite sum over all the terms up to infinite order of the interaction @xmath3 involves the three particle t - matrix @xmath63 and is shown in fig .",
