    "cosmic censorship conjecture remains an unsolved problem in general relativity . in the absence of proof , finding",
    "an acceptable counterexample is very important , as it would resolve the issue one way or the other .",
    "but even that remains elusive .",
    "while there are numerous examples of initial conditions that form a naked singularity in general relativity , none of them are generic as required by the terms of the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "recently , hertog , horowitz , and maeda argued that cosmic censorship is generically violated in asymptotically anti de sitter spacetimes @xcite , in particularly in five - dimensional supergravity arising from string theory constructs @xcite .",
    "the counterexample consists of an initial data set which is known to form a singularity and an argument that it can not form a black hole in the collapse .",
    "that would leave the possibilities that singularity is naked , which would disprove cosmic censorship conjecture , or consumes the entire spacetime ( big crunch ) , which initially was deemed unlikely by the authors .",
    "these papers have caused quite a controversy in the literature .",
    "the arguments of @xcite were called into question by a number of papers , on grounds of both analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite calculations .",
    "the authors themselves pointed out a gap @xcite in their first example @xcite , and reconsidered the possibility of a big crunch @xcite .",
    "the present paper investigates the possibility of cosmic censorship violation numerically .",
    "earlier numerical studies @xcite are suggestive of a black hole formation .",
    "however , they are not conclusive due to the flawed coordinate choice , which breaks at the moment of apparent horizon formation , and prevents the code from seeing the whole spacetime , thus leaving the possibility of a singularity subsequently becoming naked .",
    "this shortcoming is resolved in the present paper by using a characteristic double - null code .",
    "conceptually , the code is similar to the one used to investigate the global structure of the spacetime in the critical collapse of the scalar field @xcite , although the implementation is entirely new .",
    "several issues specific to asymptotically ads spacetimes had to be addressed , in particular boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "we focus on cosmic censorship counterexample in the string theory context @xcite , and perform high - resolution numerical simulations of the evolution of two families of negative mass initial scalar field profiles for various values of parameters and different boundary conditions at the cutoff . in no instances",
    "formation of naked singularity is seen .",
    "instead , numerical evidence indicates that black holes form in the collapse , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "our results clearly show where the ` no black hole ' argument of @xcite fails .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : coord ] , the issue of a coordinate choice is discussed in view of the requirements of testing cosmic censorship conjecture numerically . the scalar field evolution equations and the implementation of the algorithm are described in section  [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "the numerical results of investigation of cosmic censorship in string theory are given in section  [ sec : string ] , and summarized in section  [ sec : conlusion ] .",
    "in numerical investigations of singularity formation and global structure of the spacetime , the coordinate choice plays a crucial role . to study the global structure , coordinates must cover the entire spacetime . to see the singularity inside a black hole ,",
    "coordinates must penetrate the horizon . to prevent the singularity from corrupting the rest of the spacetime",
    "once it forms ( if it is not naked , that is ) , the information propagation speed ( both numerical and true characteristic ) must be under control .",
    "these issues can not be avoided if one wishes to study cosmic censorship numerically .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt double - null coordinate system , which is particularly suited for the above requirements . the spherically symmetric @xmath0-dimensional spacetime metric",
    "can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the metric of a unit @xmath3-dimensional sphere , and the two - manifold metric @xmath4 is written in explicitly conformally - flat form . throughout the paper",
    ", we will be freely switching between minkowski and double - null coordinates on the flat two - manifold @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the familiar form of anti de  sitter metric in spherically symmetric static coordinates @xmath8 transforms to @xmath9 in coordinate system ( [ eq : conf ] ) .",
    "one should note that the peculiar property of ads that the spatial infinity `` is not very far away '' is reflected in the fact that a finite interval @xmath10 $ ] covers the whole ads spacetime in conformal coordinates ( [ eq : conf ] ) .",
    "indeed , these are the coordinates used in construction of a carter - penrose conformal diagram of the ads spacetime .    in spherical symmetry , one can define a local mass by @xmath11 the function @xmath12 carries information about the spacetime structure : it is negative in the trapped ( or anti - trapped ) region , positive in the regular region , and vanishes on the apparent horizon .",
    "the mass function defined by ( [ eq : m ] ) coincides with adm mass in asymptotically flat spacetimes . in asymptotically ads",
    "spacetimes , however , it diverges near spatial infinity .",
    "the physical cause for this is simple : ads has a constant ( negative ) energy density while the volume is infinite . to avoid infinities",
    ", one can subtract the divergent part from the definition of the mass @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the curvature radius of the asymptotic ads .",
    "we will refer to this mass definition as the _ reduced mass_.    although traditionally used in numerical relativity , schwarzschild coordinates , like the ones in metric ( [ eq : ads ] ) , are not suited to study the possible violation of cosmic censorship in dynamical evolution .",
    "they do not penetrate horizons ( at the apparent horizon , @xmath15 , so the metric coefficient @xmath16 necessarily diverges ) , and therefore have no chance of seeing , for example , the destruction of a black hole by infall of a negative mass and `` baring '' of the singularity inside ( if it actually happens ) .",
    "unfortunately , schwarzschild coordinates were the coordinates used in recent numerical studies @xcite of the possible counterexamples to cosmic censorship in asymptotically ads spacetimes @xcite .",
    "although the formation of a trapped surface is seen , the further fate of the spacetime remains unknown .",
    "this renders the results of @xcite largely inconclusive as far as the possible violation of the cosmic censorship goes .",
    "there are coordinate systems other than ( [ eq : conf ] ) which do penetrate the horizon , most notably the ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates @xmath17 however , in implementation of the evolution code based on this coordinate system ( which we did as well , although it is not going to be further discussed in this paper ) one encounters a problem that the numerical information propagation speed is _ higher _ than the true speed of the outgoing characteristic ( which varies on the grid ) .",
    "this leads to termination of the numerical evolution in the regions causally disconnected from the singularity , which is not a satisfactory behavior for a code that aspires to resolve the global structure of the spacetime .",
    "the true strength of double - null coordinate system ( [ eq : conf ] ) is the advantage of knowing the speed of information propagation _ everywhere in advance_. the importance of this point can not be overemphasized , as numerical information propagation properties is what makes or breaks the numerical code which has to deal with singularities before any other factor even comes into play .",
    "the final issue that needs to be discussed before we go over to evolution equations is the gauge choice .",
    "the form of the metric ( [ eq : conf ] ) is left invariant under rescaling of null coordinates @xmath18 we use this gauge freedom to place initial and boundary surfaces at known coordinate locations , namely fix center of spacetime and constant-@xmath19 cut - off at @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspondingly , and put initial data surface at @xmath22 timeslice , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauge ] .",
    "this can always be achieved simply by putting @xmath23 at @xmath24 and @xmath25 at initial surface , while rescaling @xmath26 to have @xmath27 at cut - off .",
    "in fact , it does not even fix the gauge uniquely . the residual gauge freedom ( [ eq : gauge ] )",
    "is determined by    [ eq : freedom ] @xmath28    and amounts to an odd periodic function @xmath29 of period @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "the dynamics of a scalar field @xmath32 with potential @xmath33 minimally coupled to gravity in @xmath34 dimensions is described by the action @xmath35 spherical symmetry effectively reduces the problem to evolution of three non - linearly coupled scalar fields on a flat two - dimensional manifold . substituting the spherically symmetric metric ( [ eq : conf ] ) into the scalar field action ( [ eq : action ] ) and integrating over the @xmath3-dimensional spherical subspace , one obtains the reduced action @xmath36        - { \\textstyle \\frac{2n}{r } } ( \\nabla r \\cdot \\nabla\\sigma ) \\nonumber\\\\      & & \\hspace{2.5em }        - ( \\nabla\\phi)^2 - 2 e^{-2\\sigma } v(\\phi )      \\big\\}\\ , r^n\\ , d^2 x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which describes the dynamics of a spherically symmetric gravitating scalar field . here and later",
    "the differential operators ( gradient @xmath37 and dalembertian @xmath38 ) are taken with respect to the flat two - dimensional metric ( [ eq : flat ] ) .",
    "variation of the reduced action with respect to field variables @xmath39 , @xmath32 , and @xmath19 gives equations of motion    [ eq : eom ] @xmath40    while constraint equations @xmath41 = 0\\ ] ] are recovered by variation with respect to the ( flat ) two - metric @xmath42 .",
    "the traceless part of a symmetric two - tensor has two independent components , which means there are two constraints .",
    "they can be taken either as @xmath43 and @xmath44 or @xmath45 and @xmath46 components of ( [ eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "the evolution code uses a semi - constrained algorithm . rather than solve dynamical equation ( [ eq : eom : sigma ] ) directly , ingoing ( @xmath47 ) null constraint equation @xmath48 is integrated to obtain one of the metric coefficients .",
    "the integration is particularly easy to do if one defines a new field variable @xmath49 in terms of which the constraint ( [ eq : constraint : uu ] ) is written simply as @xmath50 the field variable @xmath51 actually has a meaning beyond a mere computational convenience .",
    "it is the same @xmath51 which enters coefficients of the eddington - finkelstein metric ( [ eq : efv ] )",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : eom : r ] ) warrants further discussion .",
    "it involves a delicate cancellation of terms in both small @xmath19 and large @xmath19 regimes , which makes it susceptible to discretization errors .",
    "the loss of precision can be catastrophic , leading to numerical instability developing at either @xmath24 or large @xmath19 and subsequent code failure . after trying various discretization schemes , we settled on discretizing a form of equation ( [ eq : eom : r ] ) which eliminates non - linear gradient term in favour of a box operator for small @xmath19 @xmath52 while for large @xmath19 , the equation ( [ eq : eom : r ] ) re - written in terms of inverse radius @xmath53 is discretized instead @xmath54.\\ ] ] this largely circumvents the stability problems mentioned , while still being possible to discretize efficiently .",
    "the cauchy problem for evolution equations ( [ eq : eom ] ) requires specification of six functions of one variable at the initial spacelike surface : the values of three fields @xmath55 and their time derivatives @xmath56 .",
    "these six functions are not independent in general relativity ; they must satisfy two constraint equations ( [ eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "we restrict our attention to time - symmetric initial data . in covariant form ,",
    "the requirement of time symmetry is written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an extrinsic curvature and @xmath59 is the normal to the initial data surface . in our gauge , the initial surface is @xmath22 , so the condition of time symmetry is simply that the time derivatives @xmath56 vanish .",
    "this requirement satisfies the @xmath60 constraint identically , which leaves three functions subject to one constraint for specification of the initial data .",
    "of the two freely specifiable functions , one is physical - the initial scalar field profile , and the other is a gauge choice fixing residual gauge freedom ( [ eq : freedom ] ) .",
    "once the scalar field profile is specified on the initial time slice , the rest of the variables are obtained by integrating    [ eq : ic ] @xmath61    equation ( [ eq : ic : r ] ) follows from definitions ( [ eq : m],[eq : g ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ic : m ] ) is the remaining constraint equation re - written in terms of the physically interesting mass function @xmath62 .",
    "our gauge choice is implicitly given by equation ( [ eq : ic : g ] ) ; it corresponds to the requirement @xmath63 on the initial time slice .",
    "the integration is performed numerically using fourth order runge - kutta algorithm with constant step size .    since in asymptotically ads",
    "spacetimes the light rays take finite time to reach spatial infinity and reflect back , the issue of boundary conditions at infinity is a physical one , and can not be avoided .",
    "various boundary conditions for scalar field @xmath32 at infinity have been suggested , specifics of which we will discuss later .",
    "additional complication for numerical evolution is that it is unfeasible to include infinity on the grid , so the spacetime has to be cut - off , which we do at a constant ( large ) radius @xmath64 , and impose boundary conditions for the scalar field there .",
    "the remaining boundary condition at the cut - off is the one for the metric coefficient @xmath65 which follows from the @xmath60 constraint equation ( [ eq : constraint ] ) . in the center of the spacetime",
    ", one has the usual regularity condition for the scalar field @xmath66    the numerical evolution scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] .",
    "the field variables are discretized on a square spacetime grid of spacing @xmath67 .",
    "discretization of the evolution equations is done using the leapfrog scheme , which is second order accurate and non - dissipative . in particular , the gradient and box differential operators are discretized as    @xmath68    @xmath69    neumann boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc:0 ] ) require asymmetric discretization of the derivatives for second order accuracy @xmath70 the code was implemented in fortran , and is efficient enough to run on personal workstation class computers . since only three subsequent time steps are stored , the code is not memory - limited even for very large grids .",

    "hertog , horowitz , and maeda argued that cosmic censorship is generically violated in string theory @xcite . in their counterexample , they considered @xmath73 gauged supergravity in five dimensions , which is thought to be a consistent truncation of ten dimensional type iib supergravity on @xmath74 .",
    "they picked a single scalar component which does not act as a source for any of the other fields , thereby reducing the problem to the one of einstein gravity in five dimensions minimally coupled to a scalar field @xmath32 with negative potential @xmath75 the potential is unbounded from below , with a maximum value of @xmath76 which corresponds to the asymptotically ads spacetime with curvature scale @xmath77 .",
