    "the importance of chiral symmetry in hadron physics has been understood for more than 50 years . as an explicit lagrangian representation of the approximate chiral symmetry ( pcac ) that had been recognized in low energy pion ",
    "nucleon interactions , gell - mann and levy @xcite constructed the extremely successful linear sigma model . in that model the pion couples to the nucleon through pseudoscalar coupling , while an additional scalar ( @xmath1 ) field is also coupled linearly . at a more formal level , gell - mann @xcite proposed su(2)@xmath2su(2 ) as an exact algebra for the charges associated with the hamiltonian governing the strong interaction , even though chiral symmetry was not an exact symmetry of that hamiltonian .",
    "on the basis of current algebra one can show very generally that the amplitude for pion scattering or production must vanish as the four - momentum of the pion vanishes @xcite . within the linear sigma model ,",
    "this important result for low energy pion - nucleon scattering , for example , is only possible through a subtle cancellation of two large contributions , the first involving pion emission and absorption through the pseudoscalar ( ps ) coupling , and the second involving @xmath1 exchange in the @xmath3-channel . keeping track of the necessary cancellations between such large terms in the linear sigma model is tedious and for that reason modern formulations of chiral effective field theory tend to prefer a lagrangian formulation based on a nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "in such a formulation the natural @xmath4 vertex involves pseudovector ( pv ) coupling and the vanishing of pion  nucleon scattering amplitudes as the pion four - momentum vanishes emerges trivially . in this work , motivated by the phenomenological simplicity of enforcing soft - pion theorems , we focus on the case of pv coupling",
    ". however , since the linear realization of chiral symmetry is still used in the literature , for completeness we also compare our results with those for ps coupling .    more recently , chiral symmetry and the pion cloud of the nucleon have been shown to play a central role in understanding various flavor and spin asymmetries in quark distribution functions measured at high energies .",
    "most prominent of these has been the su(2 ) flavor asymmetry in the proton sea , with the large excess of @xmath5 quarks over @xmath6 being predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and found in deep - inelastic scattering @xcite and drell - yan experiments @xcite . while a nonperturbative pionic component of the nucleon wave function provides a natural explanation for the sign of the observed asymmetry , calculations of the magnitude of the @xmath7 difference have typically been made in models without a direct connection to qcd .",
    "furthermore , while the most convenient framework for describing high - energy reactions is the light - front , the realization of chiral symmetry on the light - front is yet to be fully understood ( for a recent discussion see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we examined the framework dependence of pion loop effects for the simple case of the nucleon self - energy .",
    "we showed that results for the model - independent , nonanalytical behavior associated with the long - range part of the pion cloud @xcite are in fact independent of whether the calculation is performed using light - front , instant form ( in the rest frame or infinite momentum frame ) , or covariant perturbation theory . on the other hand ,",
    "important differences were observed for the nonanalytic structure of the self - energy when comparing the pv and ps couplings .",
    "applying the methodologies developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we consider here the more physically relevant case of the electromagnetic coupling of the nucleon dressed by pion loops .",
    "this represents the necessary next step towards the computation of the chiral corrections to quark distribution functions of the nucleon , whose moments are given by matrix elements of twist-2 operators .",
    "the twist-2 matrix elements were studied previously by chen and ji @xcite and arndt and savage @xcite , who computed the most important pion loop contributions to the leading nonanalytic behavior within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory . in the present analysis",
    "we compute the pion loop corrections to the vertex renormalization factors using a fully relativistic framework , which includes higher order corrections in the pion mass @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate explicitly that gauge invariance and the ward - takahashi identities hold to all orders @xmath0 , provided the full set of one - loop diagrams is considered , including rainbow , tadpole and kroll - ruderman contact terms .",
    "we verify this for both pv and ps theories .",
    "using the results for the vertex corrections , we then derive the pion loop corrections to the matrix elements of the twist-2 operators for both the proton and neutron , and verify the nonanalytic behavior of the isoscalar and isovector contributions .",
    "note that for the lowest moment of the nonsinglet distribution the chiral corrections are essentially those that appear for the nucleon electromagnetic form factors at zero four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath8 .",
    "these have been computed in a relativistic formalism to one loop order in refs .",
    "in contrast to form factors , for high - energy observables such as quark distribution functions the natural framework is the light - front , to which we specialize in this work . while we also focus on the lowest moment of the quark distributions , for the reconstruction of the distributions themselves @xcite , higher moments of the distributions will of course be necessary ( sec .

    "the latter gives the leading contribution to s - wave pion - nucleon scattering @xcite , and generates the pion tadpole or bubble diagrams .",

    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lping ] ) correspond to the photon coupling to the bare nucleon and pion , respectively , the third term is the kroll - ruderman coupling @xcite required by gauge invariance , while the fourth term gives rise to a photon coupling to a pion ",
    "nucleon tadpole vertex .",
    "the lagrangians ( [ eq : lpin ] ) and ( [ eq : lping ] ) can be used to derive a set of feynman rules for computing lowest order amplitudes , which are summarized in appendix  [ app : feyn ] .    the transformation of the ps coupling lagrangian , such as in the linear @xmath1 model @xcite , to the pv coupling lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lpin ] ) can be understood as a canonical transformation of the field variables , analogous to the coordinate transformation from the cartesian coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 to the plane polar coordinates @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite . in analogy with the coordinate transformation ,",
    "the pv coupling lagrangian can be derived from the ps lagrangian with the form of @xmath38 ( representing , for example , @xmath39 ) by taking the equivalence between the ( @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41 ) coordinates , such that @xmath42 with an appropriate field redefinition for the nucleon , pion and @xmath1 fields .",
    "since the redefined scalar field turns out to be completely decoupled after the canonical transformation and becomes irrelevant to the chiral symmetry , one may completely remove it in the pv coupling lagrangian @xcite , as shown in eqs .",

    "we discuss here the consequences of neglecting the scalar field contribution for the ps theory . for on - shell nucleons obeying the free dirac equation ,",
    "the ps and pv lagrangians ( [ eq : lpin ] ) give identical results for matrix elements , provided the couplings are related by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gt ] ) . for off - shell nucleons , however , the ps and pv interactions lead to different results because of the strong coupling to negative energy states in the former .",
    "this can be illustrated by splitting the nucleon off - shell propagator into an on - shell part and an off - shell part , according to the identity @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "one observes that while the on - shell component gives equivalent results for pv and ps interactions , the contribution from the off - shell part @xmath49 differs for the pv and ps couplings @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where the leading nonanalytic behavior of @xmath50 was found to be of order @xmath51 for the ps case , in contrast to the @xmath52 behavior of the pv theory . in the nucleon self - energy , the difference in the off - shell part @xmath49 indeed appears as a pion tadpole contribution in the ps theory .",
    "since the pion tadpole involves the two - pion coupling , which corresponds to a scalar coupling , it is evident that the equivalence between the pv and ps coupling theories can not be attained without a scalar field to restore the chiral symmetry .",
