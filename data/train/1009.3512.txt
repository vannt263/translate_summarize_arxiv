    "fncma ( hd53974 ) is a bright ( @xmath2mag ) b0.5iii star and visually double . within about a century ,",
    "the relative position of components a and b , which are separated by @xmath00.6 arcsec , has changed marginally at most .",
    "a is brighter than b by about 1.2 mag .",
    "the eso science archive contains 60 vlt/_uves _ echelle spectra of fncma obtained within 1.4 hours for a study of interstellar medium , and three more spectra from _ feros _ at the 2.2-m eso / mpg telescope , la silla . in 2009 and 2010",
    ", an additional 59 echelle spectra were secured with the _ beso _ spectrograph , a clone of _ feros _ mounted on the bochum 1.5-m hexapod telescope on cerro armazones .    as a result of variable seeing and imperfect guiding",
    ", some uves spectra contain a significantly higher fraction of light from component b than others .",
    "since the light combination is geometric it has no spectral dependency , and thus , under the assumption that certain spectral features are due to either a ( e.g. , siiii 4553 ) or b ( e.g. , heii 4540 ) alone , a simple linear set of equations can be used for the disentangling of the spectra from the two stars over the entire wavelength range . the inferred spectral light ratios , between 0.75 and 0.85 , are in good agreement with the known magnitude difference .",
    "* fncma b : * this component has a spectrum typical of mid - o main - sequence stars . compared to the b0.5iii primary , it would be considerably underluminous if the pair were physical . however , assuming an o subdwarf companion does not help because , then , component b would be about 2 mag _ over_luminous . components a and b display the same set of interstellar casc ii k lines except that the redmost one is significantly stronger in b. considering also incipient emission in niii and h@xmath3 , we conclude that component b",
    "is best described as an o6v((f ) ) background star .",
    "* fncma a : * in the literature , fncma has a record of low - amplitude photometric variability and modulated spectral line profiles .",
    "but there is no consensus about its nature .",
    "our analysis of the _ hipparcos _ photometry yields a period of 0.08866d ( 2.13h ; see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fncma ] ) with @xmath00.02mag amplitude .",
    "the combination of spectral type , period , and amplitude makes fncma a @xmath4 cephei star candidate , as already suggested by other observers .",
    "this is further supported by the rapid spectral line - profile variability of component a ( however , at just 1.4h , the _ uves _ data string is too short and the _ beso _ spectra are not sufficiently densely sampled to attempt an independent period determination ) . in any case ,",
    "given the spectral variations seen in component a , we attribute the photometric variability to this component as well .",
    "much larger - amplitude long - term radial - velocity variability is apparent from the _ beso _ data : fncmaa is itself an sb1 binary with the following properties :    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     the radial - velocity curve of fncmaaa is shown in fig .",
    "[ fncma ] ( right panel ) .",
    "its relatively large amplitude suggests that the so - far ( directly ) undetected component fncmab is a fairly massive star .",
    "however , it appears too faint to be the carrier of the rapid variability .",
    "the high eccentricity and moderate orbital period of the subsystem fncmaaa@xmath5ab may enable searches for a tidal modulation of the pulsation of component aa . since fncma is bright and situated in a region with numerous other pulsating ob stars",
    ", it might be worthwhile including it in the target lists of wide - angle asteroseismology satellites such as brite ."
