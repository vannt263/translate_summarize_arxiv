    "the  naked - eye \" burst 080319b on the other hand does not even show a noticeable plateau phase and decays rather quickly with late - time decay slopes of @xmath59= 1.17 and 2.61 before and after the late - time jet break at @xmath60 s.    we can ask how the intrinsic rest - frame 2 - 10 kev luminosity light curve of grb 060729 compares to the bursts shown in figure 1 in @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , as mentioned in @xcite , _ swift _  could only follow the afterglow in the uvot with the w1 filter up to a month after the burst due to bright stars in the uvot field which caused some scatter in the uvot and an enhanced background at the position of grb 060729 .    according to model 9 ( excluding the two x - ray flare points at 2 ms and 5 ms ) in table 2 ,",

    "however , the spectral hardening around the break time can not be well interpreted in such a model .",
    "furthermore , the transition of a jet break in the wind medium usually takes two orders of magnitude in time ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) , which is inconsistent with the observation of grb 060729 . in conclusion , the temporal break at @xmath111 ms is probably not a jet break .",
    "there are two possible interpretations for the last tentative light curve break at @xmath98 ms , as follows : a jet break , or a spectral break in a spherical model .",
    "we discuss these next , after which we consider the implications of the long plateau phase .",
    "the jet + wind model predicts @xmath112 for a sideways expanding jet or @xmath113 for a non - sideways expanding jet . the value of the model - predicted temporal index after the jet break thus can not be excluded at even the @xmath114 confidence level ( see fig.[contour ] ) .",
    "recently zhang & macfadyen ( 2009 ) have performed two dimensional simulations and calculations of grb afterglow hydrodynamics and emission .",
    "they showed that the sideways expansion of grb jets can be neglected during the relativistic phase ( for the sideways expansion of grb jets see also kumar & granot 2003 , granot & kumar 2003 ) and that the change in decay slope was larger than predicted analytically .",
    "their results may further alleviate the above problem of the relatively shallow theoretical slope compared with the observed steep slope .",
    "however , the spectral softening revealed by the hardness ratio evolution around this break time somewhat disfavors the jet break interpretation .",
    "if we interpret this break as a jet break , then a half - opening angle of the jet can be inferred ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under the thin - shell approximation for the post - shocked fluid of a relativistic blast wave ,",
    "the conservation of energy ( neglecting the initial baryon loading in the fireball ) reads @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the bulk lorentz factor of the downstream fluid just behind the shock front and @xmath117 is the lorentz factor of the shock .",

    "the outflow of grb 060729 is likely spherical if the circum - burst medium is ism .",
    "however , in this way the temporal break at @xmath42 can not be explained with the hydrodynamic / geometry effect .",
    "at such a late time , the jet may also enter the non - relativistic phase in a stellar wind medium and the hydrodynamics is described by the self - similar sedov - von neumann - taylor solution .",
    "the non - relativistic transition time , where @xmath141 years is the time when a grb jet with negligible sideways expansion becomes non - relativistic . ] is @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the beaming - corrected kinetic energy of the outflow .",
    "the non - relativistic transition predicts a flattening in the light curve @xcite .",
    "the theoretical temporal slope is @xmath144 for @xmath110 , which is not inconsistent with the observations if the large error bars of the observed slope are considered .",
    "however , the trend of steepening after the break contradicts with the trend of flattening when the jet becomes non - relativistic .",
    "the jet is still inside the free wind bubble @xmath145 days after the burst in the observer s frame , indicating that the termination shock radius of the wind bubble is larger than @xmath146 pc .",
    "the size of a grb progenitor star wind bubble depends on the density and pressure of external interstellar medium , and the mass loss history of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "the large size of the wind bubble surrounding the progenitor of grb 060729 suggests ( 1 ) a fast and tenuous wind during the rsg phase prior to the wolf - rayet phase , ( 2 ) the life time of the wolf - rayet stage is relatively long , and ( 3 ) the density and pressure of the external interstellar medium should be low .",
    "therefore , from modeling the afterglow , the progenitor of grb 060729 is not likely to be located in a giant molecular cloud or a star - burst environment .",
    "further deep optical observation of the grb site and its host galaxy may help to test this prediction .",
    "we assume that the initial shock - accelerated electrons at such a late time have a broken power law distribution , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the low energy power law index and @xmath149 is the high energy power law index , @xmath150 is the break lorentz factor of electrons .",
    "this assumption is much more realistic than the single power law assumption , especially for the late time when the shock lorentz factor decreases to the order of unity / the shock is no longer ultra - relativistic ( e.g. , hededal et al .",
    "2004 ; niemiec & ostrowski 2006 ; spitkovsky 2008 ) . for simplicity , we assume @xmath151 remains a constant in time ( li & chevalier 2001 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "@xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) is equal to @xmath154 s , @xmath155 ( @xmath156 , @xmath157 is the typical synchrotron frequency of @xmath150 electrons ) is equal to @xmath158 s. the last steep decay segment can be described with @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the high energy power index is therefore derived to be @xmath161 , and the inferred spectral index is @xmath162 . from @xmath163",
    "s and @xmath164 s , we constrain the parameter @xmath165 .",
    "the above @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 are quite similar to those derived for grbs 991208 and 000301c in li & chevalier ( 2001 )",
    ".    the synchrotron emission from a spherical relativistic blast wave can be described by ( e.g. , chevalier & li 2000 ; wu et al .",
    "2005 ) @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171",
    "where @xmath172 , @xmath173 are the energy equipartition fractions of electrons and magnetic field respectively , @xmath135 is the stellar wind parameter .",
    "we have considered the cooling effect on @xmath96 by synchrotron - self - compton scattering processes .",
    "the crossing time @xmath174 in the optical band ( @xmath175 hz ) by @xmath176 no later than @xmath177 s gives @xmath178 which is easily satisfied , while the crossing time @xmath152 in the x - ray band ( @xmath179 kev ) by @xmath96 gives @xmath180 the flux density at frequency @xmath96 , @xmath181 , should be equal to the observed 2 kev x - ray flux density of @xmath182 mjy at @xmath183 s , which reads @xmath184 the above afterglow model parameters can not be tightly constrained due to the lack of more conditions / equations .",
    "however , a large late - time isotropic kinetic energy of @xmath185 ergs and a small wind parameter of @xmath186 are favored if we assume @xmath187 and @xmath188 as inferred from fittings to other afterglows ( e.g. , panaitescu & kumar 2001 ; 2002 ) . within this parameter set , @xmath189 is much higher than those derived from grbs 991208 and 000301c by li & chevalier ( 2001 ) .",
    "a large @xmath134 ( @xmath190 ergs ) at very late time ( after the plateau phase ends ) can be understood if the early long plateau phase detected both in x - ray and optical bands from a few hundred seconds to @xmath191 s since the trigger is interpreted as the period of energy injection , as already discussed in @xcite .",
    "possible scenarios for this enhanced energy injection are refreshed shocks as suggested by @xcite or the continuous energy injection by the strong magnetic field of a newborn fast - rotating magnetar or black hole as suggested by @xcite and @xcite . in the latter model ,",
    "the temporal index @xmath192 of the injected luminosity ( @xmath193 , @xmath194 ) can be derived from the observed values of the temporal and spectral indices during the plateau phase ( e.g. , table 2 of zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) . from table 5 of @xcite",
    ", we can obtain @xmath195 with @xmath196 and @xmath197 for the x - ray afterglow plateau assuming @xmath198 .",
    "such a @xmath192 value is consistent with the theoretical expectation ( @xmath199 ) of the poynting - flux dominated injection model .",
    "therefore the isotropic kinetic energy of the shock increases linearly with time , @xmath200 .",
    "the prompt isotropic gamma - ray energy release in the @xmath201 kev - @xmath202 mev band is @xmath203 ergs ( @xcite ) . adopting a typical grb efficiency of @xmath204 , the initial isotropic kinetic energy remaining in the afterglow shock is about the same order of @xmath205 , i.e. @xmath206 ergs .",
    "after the energy injection is finished , the shock energy @xmath134 is increased by a factor of @xmath207 compared to its initial value , so @xmath134 is the order of @xmath208 ergs .",
    "the lack of a jet break up to @xmath209 days results a lower limit of the half - opening angle of the grb jet , i.e. , @xmath210 which corresponds to a beaming - corrected jet ( double - sided ) energy of @xmath211    this makes it one of the most energetic jets ever seen and is the reason why we were able to detect the x - ray afterglow still 642 days after the burst .",
    "note that the energy of a fastest - rotating magnetar is @xmath212 ergs . a massive and fast - rotating black hole as the central engine is thus more likely to provide the required energy .",
    "what makes the x - ray afterglow of grb 060729 so remarkable is the fact that it was still detected even almost two years after the burst .",
    "this exceptional late - time detectability is related to three things : a ) with an initial 0.3 - 10.0 kev flux of almost @xmath213 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9 it was one of the brightest afterglows ever detected by _",

    "chandra _  nearly two years after the burst .",

    "* respectively ) were even brighter in x - rays at about 100 s after the burst than grb 060729 , but their plateau phases are significantly shorter than that of grb 060729 .",
    "they therefore faded more rapidly than grb 060729 at late times .",
    "analysis and modeling of the x - ray afterglow of grb 060729 show that this burst happened in a tenuous wind .",
    "this is consistent with the collapsar picture of long grbs . during the early plateau phase ,",
    "the energy in the external shock increased by two orders of magnitude .",
    "a reanalysis of the _ swift _ xrt light curve together with the three detections by _ chandra _ in 2007 reveal a temporal break at @xmath215 ms after the burst .",
    "the decay slope steepened from @xmath216 to @xmath217 around this break and the x - ray spectrum hardened in the meanwhile , indicating this break is a cooling break ( the cooling frequency of synchrotron radiation crosses the x - ray band ) .",
    "there is another light curve break at @xmath218 year after the burst tentatively indicated by the last two _ chandra _ detections .",
    "this break coincides with a possible spectral softening , suggesting that the break may be of spectral origin , though a hydrodynamic origin ( jet break ) is also possible .",
    "if due to a jet break , then the implied half - opening angle is @xmath219 . if due to a spectral break , such a spectral softening could be the result of a very steep power - law distribution of shock - accelerated electrons responsible for the synchrotron radiation . in this case , with no evidence for a jet break up to 642 days after the burst by _",
    "chandra _ the jet half - opening angle must be @xmath220 and the jet energy @xmath221 erg .",
    "such a large jet energy implies that the central engine must be a fast - rotating massive black hole , not a magnetar .",
    "our _ chandra _  observations presented here have shown again how important _ chandra _  is for late - time observations of grb x - ray afterglows .",
    "_ chandra _  has already been essential for the detection and non - detection of jet breaks in the x - ray afterglows of the short - duration grbs 050724 and 051221a ( * ? ? ?",
