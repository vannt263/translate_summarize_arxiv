    "the parameter @xmath123 ( resp .",
    "@xmath124 ) assumes values from @xmath125 to @xmath126 and refers to the change of the phonon number on site @xmath26 ( resp .",
    "@xmath127 ) resulting from the action of the operator @xmath128 . in the sequel",
    "we will refer to @xmath123 or @xmath124 as phonon parameters .",
    "the index @xmath129 refers to the action on the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the operators for different @xmath129 and @xmath130 read @xmath131    following ref .  , we expand the boltzmann weight in terms of the local operators , i.e. , we sample the operator strings @xmath132 according to their weight in the boltzmann factor ( @xmath133 are states in the @xmath134-phonon occupation - number basis and @xmath135 is the local operator @xmath128 which appears on the @xmath136th position of the string ) .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom can be updated using the very efficient scheme of operator loops .",
    "@xcite during this update the parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 remain unchanged . all that remains to be done is to devise an additional update for the phonon parameters .",
    "this is achieved as follows : as the operators @xmath10 and @xmath137 appear always pairwise in the string , we have to increase the phonon parameter at one position ( of the string ) and decrease it at another position . in principle the two positions can be chosen at random , but here we want to point out that this can be done more efficiently : we choose an operator @xmath128 in the string .",
    "next , we decrease ( resp .  increase , depending on an appropriate probability ) one of its phonon parameters ( associated with a site which we will call @xmath28 ) . for the previous ( resp .",
    "next ) operator in the string we choose  with a certain probability ",
    "one of three options : either ( i ) we update the phonon number on site @xmath28 by @xmath138 or ( ii ) we cancel the operation and restore the initial configuration , or ( iii ) we increase ( resp .",
    "decrease ) the phonon parameter related with site @xmath28 . in case ( ii ) or",
    "( iii ) the procedure stops , while in the first case it is iterated until we finally choose one of the other options .",
    "even though one might suspect that because of option ( ii ) the algorithm is inefficient  since it is reminiscent of the bounce process in ref .",
    "we find that our new update scheme reduces the autocorrelation time significantly .",
    "the reason for the latter may be seen in the fact that we choose only one position of the two phonon operators at random , the other is  in some optimized way  chosen by the mc algorithm .",
    "the simplest method to determine @xmath41 with monte carlo is measuring the order parameter . in our case",
    "we have two options for the order parameter : one is @xmath139 the staggered bond length,@xcite another is the staggered kinetic energy@xcite @xmath140 since these operators are linear combinations of terms appearing in the hamiltonian , there is a simple method to evaluate the expectation values with the sse.@xcite to this end we define @xmath141 ( and @xmath142 ) which are the sum of the numbers of appearances of the operators @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) in the string of operators created and updated in the simulation process .",
    "the expectation values of the order parameters are related with the mean values of the numbers @xmath141 and @xmath142 ; the relation being @xmath147 and @xmath148 since the contributions to the order parameters may be positive or negative , it is difficult to detect a finite dimerization  especially , when we are close to the critical coupling .",
    "hence , it is difficult to decide whether we are in the gapped phase or not .",
    "we therefore calculate the following expectation values @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( one should note that in general @xmath151 where @xmath152 . )",
    "these have non - zero values , but in the gapless phase they should go to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we note that while @xmath153 is independent of @xmath154 the expectation value @xmath155 _ does _",
    "depend on the shift @xmath154 .",
    "because of this and the fact that @xmath156 ( which suggests that @xmath157 decays faster with @xmath158 ) we prefer the second order parameter to the first and will only discuss @xmath157",
    ".    results for @xmath157 , the staggered kinetic energy , are presented in figs .",
    "[ gapj0 ] and [ gapj1 ] . for the @xmath0 model ( fig .",
    "[ gapj0 ] ) the order parameter @xmath157 decreases with system size as long as @xmath159 . for @xmath160",
    "it seems to increase with system size rather than decrease .",
    "we conclude that @xmath161 .",
    "a correct assessment of the critical coupling remains difficult . a rough estimate for @xmath41",
    "is obtained by assuming that @xmath41 lies in the interval @xmath162 where the behavior of @xmath157 changes .",
    "this yields @xmath163 . in principle",
    ", this estimate gives only an upper bound for @xmath41 , but when we apply the same method to the spin - rotationally invariant case , we find good agreement with the value for @xmath41 from ref .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ gapj1 ] ) .",
    "to better understand the physics of the model a mean field analysis is helpful .",
    "the main idea is to replace the displacements @xmath164 by classical variables @xmath4 .",
    "a common but general ansatz for these variables is @xmath165 . substituting this ansatz into the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hii ] ) we obtain ,      one sees that the spin - peierls model eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) does not depend on @xmath167 because of @xmath38 . at the mean field theory level we arrive at two conclusions , ( i )",
    "there is a shift in @xmath46 proportional to @xmath168 and ( ii ) there is a dimerization transition where the dimerization is proportional to @xmath169 . in the spin - peierls model ( @xmath38 )",
    "the shift in @xmath46 is absent , whereas in a toy model with @xmath170 no dimerization should be found . in our simulations ( @xmath171 )",
    "we always have a shift but , since the conductance at @xmath172 does not depend on @xmath46 , we expect that @xmath29 is independent of @xmath99 and we arrive at the scaling law @xmath173    aa s.a .",
