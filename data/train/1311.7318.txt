    "with entanglement between two quantum bits , protocols have been demonstrated for teleporting an unknown quantum state @xcite , super dense coding of information @xcite and secure communication @xcite .",
    "an arbitrary qubit can be teleported from one particle to another with the use of an entangled pair of particles , which had been experimentally verified in different quantum systems @xcite .",
    "however , distinguishing all the four bell states of the photonic qubits has remained a fundamental difficulty in achieving 100% teleportation . in the first demonstration of the teleportation with photons @xcite ,",
    "only one of the four bell states was able to distinguish from the others .",
    "thus , the efficiency of teleportation was limited to 25% .",
    "later on , a complete bell state measurement was demonstrated with non - linear interaction of photons@xcite .",
    "even though they could separate all the four bell states , the efficiency was reduced because of the non - linear process involved .    in recent years",
    ", complete bell state analysis has been proposed with the use of hyper - entanglement @xcite , where the two photons are entangled in an additional degree of freedom ( dof ) along with polarization .",
    "this method was utilized to increase the channel capacity of super dense coding @xcite .",
    "this was done by projecting each hyper - entangled photon to four single particle two - qubit bell states .",
    "nevertheless , hyper - entanglement assisted bell state analysis is not of much use in teleportation since it requires projecting the unknown state and one of the epr particle state to any of the four bell states . on the other hand",
    ", a hyper - entangled pair of particles can teleport a higher dimensional quantum state using hyper - entangled - bell - state analysis which was described using kerr non - linearity @xcite .",
    "there had been a number of studies which use spin - orbit states of light for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "khoury and milman @xcite proposed a spin to orbit teleportation scheme with 100% efficiency that uses the oam entanglement between the two photons and a spin - orbit bell state analysis ( soba ) .    in this article , we describe a three particle entangled state which finds applications in teleporting two qubits simultaneously and implementing an efficient key distribution protocol . in section  [ sc.2 ]",
    "we give a description of the proposed state .",
    "along with the mathematical form of the state we give a schematic for the state preparation . the experimental procedure for the generation of the proposed state",
    "is given in section  [ sc.3 ] .",
    "the state can be utilized to teleport two qubits using two sobas and 16 unitary transformations as given in section  [ sc.4 ] .",
    "experimental schemes for realizing the @xmath0 gates and soba have also been given in section  [ exp ] . in section [ sc.5 ]",
    "we describe a new qkd protocol using the new state , which is more efficient than the traditional ekert protocol .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sc.6 ] .",
    "we describe a system of particles in such a way that one particle is entangled to all other particles in different degrees of freedom .",
    "let us consider a system consisting of three photons where photon * 2 * is entangled with photons * 1 * and * 3 * in different degrees of freedom namely oam and polarization respectively .",
    "the polarization state of the photon * 1 * and the oam state of the photon * 3 * are arbitrary or unknown .    since the oam of a photon",
    "is expressed in infinite dimensional hilbert space , one can have higher dimensional entangled states .",
    "we take an arbitrary two dimensional subspace of the infinite dimensional oam basis as @xmath1 .",

    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fg.2 ] . to entangle photons *",
    "1 * and * 2 * in oam , a hadamard gate ( @xmath8 ) on photon * 1 * and subsequent @xmath0 gate on photon * 1 * and * 2 * are applied .",
    "both gates act in the oam degree of freedom .",
    "similarly , another hadamard ( @xmath2 ) acting on photon * 2 * and a @xmath0 between photons * 2 * and * 3 * entangle them in polarization . here , both the gates are acting on the polarization states of photons . after performing the gate operations",
    "mentioned above , the final state becomes ,    @xmath9",
    "we are proposing a method in which initially two photons are entangled in the oam and third photon is in a pure state of oam and polarization . by polarization gate operations on one of the entangled photons and the independent photon , one can arrive at the described state . experimental scheme for the generation of the state",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fg.3 ] .        to generate the described state , we start with a type i spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) of light in a second order nonlinear crystal that gives a pair of photons entangled in the oam @xcite .",
    "a vertically polarized optical vortex beam of azimuthal index 1 has been considered as the pump .",
    "the state corresponding to the pair of photons produced by the spdc of this beam is given by @xmath10    note that the experimental realization of the quantum gates in the oam basis \\",
    "{ @xmath11 } are not straightforward . moreover , in the teleportation , it is easier to project the state of a photon to one of its four spin - orbit bell state if we use even / odd basis .",
    "thus for the ease of experimental realization , we reduce the infinite dimensional entangled state to a simple two - qubit entangled state by grouping all the even and the odd oam states and rewrite the expression for the oam state in eq .   as @xmath12",
    "we define a transformation from the general oam space to the even - odd oam space as @xmath13 @xmath14    applying @xmath15 on the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "yields @xmath16 .    from the conservation of oam",
    ", we have @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we can rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath18    note that the photons are entangled in the even / odd oam states .",
    "experimentally , this transformation can be implemented by post selection in the even / odd oam basis .",
    "all the oam operations or measurements must be performed in even / odd basis using oam sorter @xcite .",
    "this maps the general oam state to even / odd basis which is mathematically represented by operator `` @xmath15 '' .",
    "let the photon * 1 * pass through a simon - mukunda polarization gadget which can convert its polarization to any arbitrary state @xcite and the photon * 2 * pass through a half wave plate at @xmath19 .",
    "thus polarization state of the photon * 1 * is encoded as the unknown state @xmath20 and the state of the photon * 2 * is encoded as @xmath21 .",
    "action of hwp on the photon * 2 * is a hadamard operation .",
    "thus , the state becomes @xmath22 now , consider the photon * 3 * with unknown superposition state of oam in the even / odd basis and with definite state polarization .",
    "its state can be expressed as , @xmath23 a polarization @xmath0 gate is applied on photon * 2 * ( control ) and * 3 * ( target ) .",
    "this operation leads to a polarization entanglement between photons * 2 * and * 3*. thus , the three particle state becomes @xmath24 this is in the same form as the proposed three particle entangled state described in section  * 2 * , eq .  .",
    "teleportation of @xmath25 qubits , in general , needs @xmath25 pairs of entangled photons . on the other hand , teleportation of @xmath26-dimensional quantum state",
    "needs @xmath26-dimensional entanglement and one has to do a joint measurement in @xmath27 dimensional bell basis @xcite .",
    "however , teleportation schemes were proposed for a @xmath26 dimensional oam state using bell filter and quantum scissors @xcite .    with the entangled state presented above",
    ", we propose an efficient scheme for teleporting a two - qubit state distributed in different dofs . the schematic diagram is given in fig .  [ fg.4 ] .",
    "the polarization state of photon * 1 * and the oam state of photon * 3 * form a four dimensional unknown two - qubit state @xmath28 which needs to be teleported .",
    "we can teleport the combined state to a single particle , photon * 2*.    the unknown polarization ( spin angular momentum ) and the entangled oam state of photon * 1 * and entangled polarization and the unknown oam state of photon * 3 * in eq .",
    ", can be projected to individual spin - orbit bell states by soba .",
    "alice performs the soba on the photons * 1 * and * 3 * and projects the state of both the particles to the corresponding spin - orbit bell states .",
    "the soba , for which the oam is in the even / odd basis , can be achieved by mach - zehnder interferometers involving an oam sorter and polarizing beam splitters @xcite .",
    "the states can be defined as @xmath29 the soba operation for photon * 1 * can be represented by a polarization controlled oam @xmath0 ( @xmath30 ) gate and a polarization hadamard ( @xmath2 ) gate operation with subsequent detection .",
    "similarly , the soba for photon * 3 * is an oam controlled polarization @xmath0 ( @xmath31 ) gate and oam hadamard ( @xmath8 ) gate operation with subsequent detection .",
    "experimental schemes for these single particle two - qubit @xmath0 gates and soba are given in section  [ exp ] .    by substituting the single particle spin - orbit bell states into a three particle wave function in eq .  , we get @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are single particle spin - orbit bell states corresponding to the photons * 1 * & * 3 * respectively .",
    "@xmath35 is a transformation matrix for the spin - orbit state of photon * 2*. it has been introduced for the compact representation of the 16 states of photon * 2 * given in table  [ tb.1 ] . after the soba measurements on the photons * 1 * and * 3 * , state of the photon * 2 * becomes @xmath36 the state corresponding to a detection of @xmath37 in sobas .",
    "the states corresponding to all possible soba outcomes are given in the first and the second columns of the table  [ tb.1 ] .",
    "note that the information encoded in the polarization state of the photon * 1 * is transferred to the oam state of the photon * 2 * and the information encoded in the oam state of the photon * 3 * is transferred to the polarization state of the photon * 2*. so , to get the initial state , bob has to do a swapping ( @xmath38 ) between the oam and the polarization along with other unitary transformations which use only polarization operations .",
    "these operations can be implemented with the standard wave plates which makes the experimental realization of this method more feasible .     - unitary transformation given in table  [ tb.1],width=288 ]    there are 16 possible outcomes for alice measurements which demand 16 different unitary operations by bob to complete the teleportation protocol .",
    "alice communicates her measurement outcome ( @xmath39 ) classically to bob .",
    "bob does the corresponding unitary transformation @xmath40 ( given in the third column of table  [ tb.1 ] ) on state of photon * 2 * to get @xmath41 which completes the teleportation of unknown state given in eq .  .",
    "a swap operation is equivalent to consecutive @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 gate operations .",
    "since the operation done in polarization will be transferred to the oam after the swap operation , one can perform all the operations in polarization which are well known .",
    "two half wave plates before and after the swap gate can perform 16 unitary operations which is required for the teleportation .",

    "@xmath46=0,1,2 corresponds to the detection of oam states 0 , 1 and -1 respectively .",
    "the coincidence measurements with the combinations of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath49 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are required for the key distribution and to check the security of the key using eq .   and  .",
    "our protocol has three advantages compared to traditional ekert protocol  @xcite .    *",
    "if ekert protocol is used , then around @xmath55 pairs of photons , i.e. , @xmath56 photons ( in practice , little more than @xmath56 ) are required to establish a secret key of length @xmath57 between alice and bob . in our approach , around @xmath58 photons",
    "would be required for the same purpose .",
    "hence , in terms of number of photons required , ekert s protocol is 33% less efficient than ours .",
    "* on the other hand , if the same number of photons are used in ekert and our protocol and if the target key length is also the same , then because of more entanglement resource , our protocol would have more redundancy and hence can tolerate more noise .",

    "possibility of a new entangled state and its application in teleporting a two - qubit oam - polarization quantum state and in the qkd have been discussed .",
    "the new teleportation method overcomes the difficulty of measuring in two particle polarization bell basis , by implementing independent single particle two - qubit bell measurements .",
    "the method critically depends on the experimental realizations of polarization @xmath0 gate as well as single particle two - qubit @xmath0 gates .",
    "all the 16 unitary transformations which are required for this teleportation scheme can be realized with linear optical components along with a swap gate . once the state given in eq .",

    "extending this to higher dimensions is mathematically trivial though creating entanglement in different dofs has experimental limitations . with the new qkd protocol ,",
    "the sender and the receiver need to use less resource than traditional ekert protocol to share the secret key of the same length .",
