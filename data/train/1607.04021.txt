    "best \" being the simplest one able to capture all the essential features needed in the investigation . among others , models of elastic sandwich - structured composites",
    "are experiencing an increasing interest in the literature , mainly due to their wide use in sandwich panels and their applications in many branches of modern civil , mechanical and aerospace engineering @xcite .",
    "sandwich structures are in general symmetric , and their variety depends on the configuration of the core .",
    "such devices are designed to have high bending stiffness with overall low density @xcite . in particular ,",
    "sandwich beams , plates and shells are flexible elastic structures built up by attaching two thin and stiff external layers ( beams , plates or shells ) to a homogeneously - distributed lightweight and thick elastic core @xcite .",
    "their interest , which is relevant in structural mechanics , has been recently extended even to nanostructures ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein )",
    ".    models of elastic sandwich structures can be obtained by applying either the euler - bernoulli theory for beams or the kirchhoff - love theory for thin plates . in this context",
    ", several papers have been devoted to the mechanical properties of elastically - connected double euler - bernoulli beams systems .",
    "for instance , free and forced transverse vibrations of simply supported double - beam systems have been studied in @xcite , while the articles @xcite are concerned with the effect of compressive axial load on free and forced oscillations . within the framework of nanostructures , axial instability and buckling of double - nanobeam systems",
    "have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "once a model is established , the next step is to ( possibly ) solve the mathematical equations , in order to discover the nature of the system response .",
    "in fact , the main goal is to predict and control the actual dynamics . to this end",
    ", the analysis of the steady states , and in particular of their closed - form expressions , becomes crucial .",
    "this is even more urgent when dealing with nonlinear systems , where the longterm dynamics is strongly influenced by the occurrence of a rich set of stationary solutions .      in this paper",
    ", we aim to classify the stationary solutions , finding their explicit closed - form expressions , to symmetric elastically - coupled extensible double - beam systems .",
    "for instance , a sandwich structure composed of two elastic beams bonded to an elastic core ( fig.[fig_1]a ) , or the road bed of a girder bridge composed of an elastic rug connecting two lateral elastic beams ( fig.[fig_1]b ) . in both cases ,",
    "the mechanical structure can be described by means of two equal beams complying with the nonlinear model of woinowsky - krieger @xcite , which takes into account extensibility , so that large deformations are allowed .",
    "the beams are supposed to have the same natural length @xmath3 , constant mass density , and common thickness @xmath4 . at their ends , they are simply supported and subject to evenly distributed axial loads .",
    "a system of linear springs models the elastic filler connecting the beams : when the system lies in its natural configuration , the beams are straight and parallel .",
    "the distance between the beams is equal to the free lengths of the springs . denoting by @xmath5 the poisson ratio of the beams , the dynamics of the resulting undamped model is ruled by the following nonlinear equations in dimensionless form ( see the final appendix for more details about the derivation of the model ) @xmath6 having set @xmath7 in the vertical plane ( @xmath8-@xmath9 ) ,",
    "system   describes the in - plane downward rescaled deflections of the midline of the beams are appropriate rescaling of the original vertical deflections of the midline of the two beams @xmath10\\times \\r^+ \\to \\r,\\ ] ] in comply with the dimensionless character of system  .",
    "see the appendix for more details . ]",
    "@xmath11\\times\\r^+\\to\\r\\ ] ] with respect to their natural configuration ( see fig.[fig_1]a ) .",
    "it may be also used to describe out - of - plane rescaled deflections of the same double - beam structure , accounting for both vertical and torsional oscillations ( see fig.[fig_1]b ) . in the latter situation ,",
    "each beam is assumed to swing in a vertical plane and the lateral movements are neglected .",
    "the structural constants @xmath12 are related to the common flexural rigidity of the beams and the common stiffness of the inner elastic springs , respectively , whereas the parameter @xmath13 summarizes the effect of the axial force acting at the right ends of the beams :  positive when the beams are stretched , negative when compressed .",
    "[ fig_1],title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]   [ fig_1],title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    in this work , we are interested in the stationary solutions to the evolutionary problem  , subject to the hinged boundary conditions .",
    "namely , setting @xmath14 we consider the dimensionless system of odes @xmath15 supplemented with the boundary conditions @xmath16 it is apparent that problem - always admits the trivial solution @xmath17 , while the occurrence and the complexity of nontrivial solutions strongly depend on the values of structural dimensionless parameters @xmath18 , all of which are allowed to be large ( see the final comment in the appendix ) .",
    "when system is uncoupled ( i.e.  in the limit situation when @xmath19 ) , the analysis reduces to the one of the single woinowsky - krieger beam @xmath20 in this case , it is well - known that an increasing compressive axial load leads to a series of fork bifurcations .",
    "the critical values of @xmath21 at which bifurcations occur depend on the eigenvalues of the differential operator ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . after exceeding these values ,",
    "the axial compression is sustained in one of two states of equilibrium :  a purely compressed state with no lateral deviation ( the trivial solution ) or two symmetric laterally - deformed configurations ( buckled solutions ) .",
    "this is why the phenomenon is usually referred to as _",
    "buckling_. another interesting model , formally obtained by neglecting the second equation of system and by taking @xmath22 in the first one , reads @xmath23 namely , a single woinowsky - krieger beam which relies on an elastic foundation . in this case , bifurcations of the trivial solution split into two series , whose critical values depend also on the ratio @xmath24 between the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 connected with the stiffness of the foundation and the flexural rigidity of the beam @xcite .      clearly , when the double - beam system is considered , the picture becomes much more difficult . to the best of our knowledge , in spite of the quite large number of papers about statics and dynamics of single woinowsky - krieger beams ( e.g.  @xcite ) ,",
    "no analytic results concerning models with a coupling between two ( or more ) nonlinear beams of this type are available in the literature",
    ". this may be due to the fact that classifying and finding closed - form expressions for the solutions to equations of this kind is in general a very difficult , if not impossible , task .",
    "indeed , it is usually unavoidable to replace distributed characteristics with discrete ones , so producing approximate solutions by resorting to some discretization procedures .",
    "unfortunately , this strategy can be hardly applied when multiple stable states occur ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .    here",
    ", our aim is to fill this gap . to this end ,",
    "we first recast - into an abstract nonlinear system involving an arbitrary strictly positive selfadjoint linear operator @xmath27 with compact inverse .",
    "then , we classify all the nontrivial solutions , finding also their explicit expressions . in particular , every solution is shown to exhibit at most three nonvanishing fourier modes .",
    "according to our classification , the set of stationary solutions to nonlinear double - beam systems is very rich .",
    "the nonlinear terms accounting for extensibility substantially influence the instability ( or buckling ) :  the effects are higher with increasing values of ( minus ) the axial - load parameter @xmath21 , and give rise to both in - phase ( synchronous ) buckling modes and out - of - phase ( asynchronous ) buckling modes .",
    "this feature becomes quite important in the study of the longterm behavior , as it may lead up to nonsymmetric energy exchanges between the two beams under small perturbations . in the asymptotic dynamics of a double - beam structure like the road bed of a girder bridge ( fig.[fig_1]b ) , a nonsymmetric energy exchange of this kind is apt to mimic the transition from vertical to torsional oscillations , such as those occurred in the collapse of the tacoma narrows suspension bridge ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another remarkable fact is that the model has been derived under the assumption that the ratio @xmath28 between the thickness and the natural length of the beam is very small ; the critical values at which bifurcations occur are consistent with such an assumption , namely , they are of order @xmath28 as well .",
    "we also stress that system   is dimensionless , and no physical parameters have been artificially set equal to one .",
    "finally it is worth noting that , as a consequence of the abstract formulation , all the results are valid also for multidimensional structures .",
    "in particular , they are applicable to flexible double - plate sandwich structures with hinged boundaries , provided that the plates are modeled according to the berger s",
    "approach @xcite .      in the next ",
    "2 we introduce the aforementioned operator @xmath27 , and we rewrite - in an abstract form . in ",
    "3 we prove that every solution can be expressed as a linear combination of at most three distinct eigenvectors of @xmath27 .",
    "the subsequent  4 deals with the analysis of unimodal solutions ( i.e.  solutions with only one eigenvector involved ) . in particular , we show that not only a double series of fork bifurcations of the trivial solution occur , but also buckled solutions may suffer from a further bifurcation when @xmath29 exceeds some greater critical value . in  5 we study the so - called equidistributed energy solutions ( i.e.  solutions with evenly distributed elastic energy ) , and we prove that bimodal and trimodal steady states pop up .",
    "in  6 we classify the general ( not necessarily equidistributed ) bimodal solutions , while in  7 we show that every trimodal solution is necessarily an equidistributed energy solution , the final  8 is devoted to a comparison with some single - beam equations previously studied in the literature .",
    "the derivation of the evolutionary physical model is carried out in full detail in the concluding appendix .",
    "let @xmath30 be a separable real hilbert space , and let @xmath31 be a strictly positive selfadjoint linear operator , where the ( dense ) embedding @xmath32 is compact .",
    "in particular , the inverse @xmath33 of @xmath27 turns out to be a compact operator on @xmath34 .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath35 , we introduce the compactly nested family of hilbert spaces ( the index @xmath36 will be omitted whenever zero ) @xmath37 then , given @xmath38 and @xmath1 , we consider the abstract nonlinear stationary problem in the unknown variables @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41    a couple @xmath42 is called a _ weak solution _ to if @xmath43 for every test @xmath44 .",
