    "recently the belle collaboration found two narrow structures , namely the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 , in the @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 invariant masses of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays processes  @xcite . in their latest data , also the open - bottom channels @xmath23 and @xmath24 are seen  @xcite . the fact that they lie in the bottomonium mass region and they are charged means that they can not be the conventional bottomonium mesons , and their isospins are 1 .",
    "the observation of the neutral state with a mass consistent with that of the @xmath0  @xcite presents a further confirmation that they are members of isotriplets .",
    "if they exist as observed by the belle collaboration , they must be exotic states with a pair of hidden @xmath25 and valence light quarks .",
    "considering parity and charge parity , their quantum numbers should be @xmath26 , and the charge parity of the neutral state is negative .    assuming that the total width of @xmath27 is saturated by the seven channels already observed experimentally , i.e. @xmath2 @xmath18 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , belle gives the branching ratio of each channel in @xmath31 three  body decays  @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the states to the @xmath32 thresholds leads to the suggestion that they could be hadronic molecules of the corresponding states  @xcite , to be distinguished from the compact @xmath33 tetraquarks  @xcite . by hadronic molecules , we mean states composed of hadrons",
    " they can be bound states ( poles on the physical sheet with respect to the bottom - meson channel with a mass smaller than the threshold value ) , resonances or virtual states ( both on the second sheet with respect to the relevant bottom - meson channel  the former above , the latter below the threshold ) .",
    "based on a nonrelativistic effective field theory ( nreft )  @xcite , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite show that the @xmath34 data can be described within the bound state scenario .",
    "therein , the @xmath35 coupling constants are related to the binding energies using a model - independent relation for @xmath36-wave shallow bound states  @xcite . however , since now data on the decays of @xmath27 to open bottom channels are available , we can chose a more general ansatz and take these couplings from data directly  in this way our results are valid for bound states , resonances as well as virtual states . since we start from the assumption that the @xmath10 states are purely molecular states , their decays into the @xmath2 and @xmath3 can only happen via @xmath37 ( for simplicity , @xmath38 will be used to represent @xmath37 in the following ) and @xmath30 loops .",
    "since both @xmath10 s are located very close to the corresponding open - bottom threshold , the system can in principle be examined by the nreft approach .    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , a systematic power counting can be established for the @xmath39 or @xmath40 emissions between charmonium states . because the @xmath36-wave and @xmath9-wave heavy quarkonia couple to the open - flavor heavy meson and anti - meson in a @xmath9-wave and an @xmath36-wave , respectively , the transitions studied in ref .",
    "@xcite can be classified into three groups , namely transitions between the @xmath36-wave heavy quarkonium states , @xmath9-wave states , and between the @xmath9- and @xmath36-wave states .",
    "the decay amplitudes of different groups have their own nonrelativistic velocity counting . because the @xmath10 states have positive parity , they couple to the bottom and anti - bottom mesons in an @xmath36-wave .",
    "thus , the transitions @xmath41 are analogous to those between @xmath9- and @xmath36-wave quarkonia , while the @xmath42 processes are similar to those between two @xmath9-wave quarkonia .",
    "the main difference is that the normal heavy quarkonium transitions with the emission of a pion studied in ref .",
    "@xcite break isospin symmetry while the @xmath10 decays do not .",
    "thus , by studying the @xmath43 and @xmath3 , we can examine the power counting rules established in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also better understand the properties of these two exotic states .",
    "further insight can be gained by studying radiative decays of the neutral @xmath10 states into bottomonia . because the @xmath44 states are the spin partners of the @xmath45 of the same principal quantum number , they couple to the bottom mesons with the same coupling constant in the heavy quark limit .",
    "thus , since molecular states can decay via bottom meson loops only , the radiative decays @xmath46 are related to the pionic decays @xmath47 .",
    "note that these transitions would be unrelated if the @xmath10 states were of tetraquark nature .",
    "similar considerations were made in ref .",
    "@xcite for hindered m1 transitions of the @xmath9-wave charmonia .",
    "these decay channels have not been observed so far , but they could be potentially important in confirming the molecular nature of the @xmath10 states , and thus are worthwhile to study experimentally .    in this paper , we will assume that the @xmath27 are dynamically generated from the @xmath48 interactions , i.e. hadronic molecules of the @xmath48 .",
    "we will try to identify the quantities which are sensitive to such a scenario .",

    "@xcite , a nreft method was introduced to study the meson loop effects in the heavy quarkonium transitions .",
    "the power counting scheme was analyzed in detail in ref .",

    ", we briefly review the ideas of refs .  @xcite together with an improved discussion for the higher loop diagrams .    in general ,",
    "the heavy meson velocities relevant for the decay of some particle @xmath51 may be estimated as @xmath52 , where the absolute value indicates that the formula can be used for both bound systems as well as resonances .",
    "the analogous formula holds when the two heavy mesons merge to a quarkonium in the final state .",
    "according to the rules of a nonrelativistic effective field theory  @xcite ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) , the momentum and non - relativistic energy count as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . for the integral measure one finds @xmath55 .",
    "the heavy meson propagator counts as @xmath56 .",
    "the leading order @xmath36-wave vertices do not have any velocity dependence , while the case for the @xmath9-wave vertices is more complicated : it scales either as @xmath53 when the momentum due to @xmath9-wave coupling contracts with another internal momentum , or as the external momentum @xmath57 when @xmath57 is contracted .     and @xmath12 .",
    "]    we start with the radiative transitions as shown in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] . if the @xmath10 states are molecular states , their spin wave functions contain both @xmath58 and 1 components  @xcite , where @xmath59 is the total spin of the @xmath60 component .",
    "thus , the radiative decays of the @xmath10 states into the spin - triplet @xmath61 can occur without heavy quark spin flip and survive in the heavy quark limit .",
    "this is different from the m1 transitions between two @xmath9-wave heavy quarkonia which have been analyzed in ref .",
    "both the couplings of @xmath10 and @xmath61 to a pair of heavy mesons are in an @xmath62wave , and the photon coupling to the bottom mesons is proportional to the photon energy @xmath63 . for the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ]  ( a ) the amplitude therefore scales as @xmath64 where the velocity that appears is @xmath65  @xcite , since @xmath66 , if the central values of the measured @xmath27 masses , 10607.2  mev and 10652.2  mev , are used , while @xmath67 ranges from 0.12 for the @xmath68 to 0.26 for the @xmath69 to 0.37 for the @xmath70 .",
    "here we used the mass of the @xmath68 , 10.53  gev , as reported by the atlas collaboration  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we will count @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "the scaling ensures that the amplitude gets larger when the bottomonium in the final state is closer to the open - bottom threshold .",
    "thus , we expect for the absolute value of the decay amplitude from this diagram @xmath73 if the @xmath74 coupling constants take the same value . diagram ( a ) can be controlled easily in theory .",
    "thus , clear predictions can be made whenever diagram ( a ) dominates . in the following",
    "we will identify such dominant decays based on the power counting for the nreft .    as for fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ]  ( b ) , the coupling @xmath75 can not be deduced by gauging the coupling of @xmath61 to a @xmath76-meson pair .",
    "thus , it has to be gauge invariant by itself and proportional to the electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath77 .",
    "this gives a factor of photon energy @xmath63 and the amplitude of fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ]  ( b ) scales as @xmath78 where we have assumed that the corresponding coupling is of natural size .",
    "thus , diagram ( b ) is suppressed compared to diagram ( a ) at least by a factor of @xmath79 for the decay to @xmath70 and even smaller for the excited states .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the graph displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ]  ( c ) .",
    "here we have a two - loop diagram , so that the velocities running in different loops are significantly different  the one in the loop connected to the @xmath10 is @xmath80 , and the other is @xmath67 .",
    "it is important to count them separately since @xmath81 due to the very close proximity of the @xmath10 to the threshold  see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . ] .",
    "the internal pion momentum scales as the larger loop momentum , and thus the pion propagator should be @xmath82 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit , the factor @xmath85 has been introduced to give the same dimension as the estimate for the first two diagrams , and the hadronic scale was introduced via the identification @xmath86 .",
    "thus the two - loop diagram is suppressed compared to the leading one , eq .",
    "( [ eq : leadrad ] ) , by a factor @xmath87 , where we used for the coupling @xmath88 the value @xmath89 ( a recent lattice calculation gives @xmath90  @xcite ) , and @xmath91  gev .",
    "it can easily be seen that fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ]  ( d ) gives the same contribution which also reflects the fact that they are both required at the same order to ensure gauge invariance .",
    "thus , from our power counting it follows that the loop diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] ( b)-(d ) provide a correction of at most 10% .",
    "we will therefore only calculate diagram ( a ) explicitly and introduce a 10% uncertainty for the amplitudes which corresponds to 20% for the branching ratios .",
    "higher loop contributions are to be discussed later .",
    "next we consider the hadronic transition @xmath92 .",
    "this decay has already been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the same formalism .",
    "again , since the @xmath45 has even parity , its coupling to the bottom mesons is in an @xmath36-wave .",
    "in addition , the final state must be in a @xmath9-wave to conserve parity , such that the amplitude must be linear in the momentum of the outgoing pion , @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore find for the one - loop contribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] ( e ) @xmath93 while fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] ( f ) gives @xmath94 notice that the pion has to be emitted after the loop if the @xmath10 is a pure hadronic molecule , so that the velocity in the counting should be @xmath80 instead of @xmath95 .",
    "this is suppressed by @xmath96 which leads to a correction of the order of 2% noticing that @xmath97 .",
    "the two - loop diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] ( g ) contributes as @xmath98 where we have used that the energy from the @xmath99 vertex can be identified with the energy of the outgoing pion  @xcite , @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath101 vertex contributes a factor of the external momentum @xmath57 since the @xmath92 is a @xmath9-wave decay , and this is the only @xmath9-wave vertex .",
    "therefore , this diagram is suppressed compared to the leading loop , eq .  , by a factor @xmath102 which is smaller than 10% .",
    "thus , also for the transitions @xmath103 we may only calculate the leading one - loop diagrams , fig .  [",
    "fig : powercounting1 ] ( e ) , and assign an uncertainty of 10% to the rates which gives an uncertainty of 20% for the branching ratios .",
    "higher loop contributions are to be discussed later .    finally , we consider at the decay channel @xmath104 . here",
    "the final state is in an @xmath36-wave , but the coupling of the @xmath105 to @xmath106 is in a @xmath9-wave . for diagram ( e ) the momentum due to this coupling has to scale as the external pion momentum .",
    "together with the pionic coupling that is also linear in the pion momentum , the amplitude is thus proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "the one - loop diagram for @xmath108 via fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] ( e ) , is therefore estimated as @xmath109 the diagram fig .  [",
    "fig : powercounting1 ] ( f ) on the other hand gives @xmath110 where @xmath111 is introduced in order to get the same dimension as eq .  .",
    "compared to the one - loop diagram ( e ) this is a relative suppression of order @xmath112 which is less than 10% for all the @xmath105 states , where the value of @xmath113 is about 0.46 , 0.33 and 0.22 for the @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 states , respectively . the two - loop contribution with the exchange of a pion , fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] ( g ) , is estimated as @xmath117 thus , the strength of two - loop diagram relative to leading one - loop diagram is estimated for the @xmath49 as @xmath118 .",
    "numerically , this corresponds to a factor of around 0.6 for the @xmath119 and 0.7 for the @xmath120 amplitudes .",
    "as a consequence , the branching ratios for these transitions can only be calculated with rather large uncertainties up to 100% .     into a heavy quarkonium and a pion or photon . ]",
    "the heavy meson velocities relevant for the mentioned transitions range from 0.02 to 0.5  in momenta this is a range from 0.1 to 2.5  gev . while pion contributions are expected to be suppressed significantly and can be controlled within chiral perturbation theory for pion momenta of up to 500 mev and smaller , higher pion loop contributions might get significant for momenta beyond 1  gev .",
    "we will now study those higher pion loops within the power counting scheme outlined above .",
    "we will start with the three - loop diagrams , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting2 ] considering first diagram  ( a ) .",
    "the results can be easily generalized to higher loops as shown below .",
    "compared to the two - loop diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] , there are one more pion propagator and two more bottom meson propagators in the transition and none of them is connected to the external heavy quarkonia .",
    "in addition , there is no two - bottom - meson unitary cut present . as a consequence",
    ", we have to use a relativistic power counting  c.f .",
    "then pion momentum and energy are of order @xmath121 , with @xmath122 the velocity of the @xmath123-meson connected to the @xmath60-meson in the final state .",
    "both the energies and momenta of the additional bottom mesons are now of the same order , such that the bottom - meson propagator is counted as @xmath124 .",
    "the integral measure reads @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the additional factor as compared to the two - loop diagrams is @xmath126 if @xmath127 , then the three - loop diagram ( a ) is of similar size as that of the two - loop diagrams .",
    "this is the case for the processes with the @xmath128 , and @xmath129 . for smaller values of @xmath122",
    ", it is suppressed . in diagram",
    "( b ) there is only one more bottom meson propagator and the additional @xmath130 vertex is in an @xmath36-wave .",
    "we obtain @xmath131 four and higher loop diagrams that can not be absorbed by using physical parameters may now be estimated by applying a proper number of factors of the kind of eqs .",
    "( [ higherloop1 ] ) and ( [ higherloop2 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that also additional topologies provide analogous factors . since @xmath132",
    ", higher loops get increasingly important , if @xmath133 . for @xmath134 ,",
    "the three and more loops are of the same order as the two - loop diagrams , which is the case for the @xmath135 states , and thus suppressed in comparison with the one - loop contribution . for the @xmath136 bottomonia in the final state ,",
    "the value of @xmath122 is even smaller , and the multiple loops are even suppressed as compared to the two - loop contribution .    to summarize the findings of the power counting analysis , we conclude that the calculation of one - loop triangle diagrams as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] ( a ) and ( e ) is a good approximation , with a controlled uncertainty , to the transitions of the @xmath27 into the @xmath137 and @xmath138  for the @xmath139 the phase space is too limited .",
    "but similar calculations are not applicable to the decays into the @xmath140 states as well as the @xmath2 . for the decays",

    "@xcite , the nreft leading loop calculation preserves the heavy quark spin structure . because the @xmath10 contains both @xmath58 and 1 components , the leading contribution to its transitions into the normal bottomonia , which are eigenstates of @xmath59 , comply with the spin symmetry .",
    "this conclusion should be true no matter what nature the @xmath10 s have as long as the spin structure does not change .",
    "thus , one expects that the branching fraction ratios of the decays of the same @xmath10 into a spin - multiplet bottomonia plus a pion or photon , such as @xmath143 are insensitive to the structure of the @xmath10 .",
    "this statement may be confirmed by observing that our results , as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : radiative - ratio ] agree with the ratios @xmath144 ( for the @xmath140 states ) and @xmath145 ( for the @xmath135 states ) which are obtained solely based on heavy quark spin symmetry in ref .",
    "one may expect a derivation from the spin symmetry results , which is due to the mass difference between the @xmath123 and @xmath146 mesons , to be of order @xmath147 .",
    "the central values given in tab .",
    "[ tab : radiative - ratio ] deviate from the spin symmetry results by at most 20% , and they are fully consistent considering the uncertainties .",
    "since their discovery in an impressive number of theoretical works the molecular nature of the @xmath10 states was investigated . in this section we compare in some detail our approach to the calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite which deal with some of the decays considered in our paper .",
    "common to most of these works is that , contrary to our approach , the second part of the one loop integral shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powercounting1 ] ( e ) is either approximated  @xcite or calculated differently  @xcite . especially , by this the analytic structure of the loop gets changed converting it to a topology of type ( f ) in that figure , since the second @xmath148 cut was removed from the loop .",
    "however , our power counting gives that it is exactly this cut that drives the enhancement of the one loop diagrams compared to the two - loop diagrams .    since the loop of type ( f ) gives the wave function at the origin in @xmath149-space , the formalism applied in refs .",
    "@xcite is basically identical to that used in the classic calculations for the decay of positronium into two photons .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is applicable only if the range of the transition potential from the constituents to the final state is significantly shorter ranged than the potential that formed the molecule  a scale not to be mixed up with the size of the molecule which can be very large for a shallow bound state .",
    "however , the range of the binding momentum of the @xmath10 states is not known and might well be of the order of the range of the transition potential ( at least as long as the final bottomonium is not a ground state ) .",
    "in such a situation in ref .",
    "@xcite it is proposed to calculate the full loop function for the transitions , as done here in our work , which in effect means to expand around the limit of a zero range potential that forms the bound state . in that paper",
    "it is also shown that the potentially most important corrections to the transition rate cancel , such that the uncertainty of the procedure is given by the binding momentum of the molecule in units of the range of forces and not of the order of the final momenta in units of the range of forces .",
    "this gives an additional justification for the approach we are using .",
    "we now discuss the formalisms of refs .",
    "@xcite in some more detail .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an effective field theory called x - eft is used .",
    "it is valid for hadronic molecules with small binding energies so that the pion mass and the heavy meson hyperfine splitting are hard scales .",
    "the decays of the @xmath27 can be represented by a bubble with two vertices , one connecting the @xmath48 to the @xmath27 states and the other is a local operator for the @xmath150 coupling .",
    "the coefficient of the local operator depends on the pion energy , and is obtained by matching to the tree - level diagrams in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory . for more details , we refer to refs .",

    "@xcite assuming @xmath153 . as outlined in the discussion below eq .",

    "@xcite the transition from the intermediate @xmath154-system to the final @xmath155 system was assumed to be local , however , here the strength of this local operator was calculated differently : the authors estimate it via the overlap integral of the @xmath156 component in the @xmath154 wave function with the outgoing @xmath156 pair in the presence of a dipole operator .",
    "while this procedure is certainly justified when there are @xmath140 states in the final state  here the relative momenta between the two @xmath123 mesons are beyond 2.5 gev and indeed in this case our effective field theory does not converge anymore ( c.f . sec .  [",

    "@xcite the full heavy meson loop is evaluated , but regularized with a form factor .",

    "in a first step in that work a cut - off parameter was adjusted to reproduce each individual transition .",
    "it is found that the cut - off parameters needed for the @xmath50 transitions are typically larger and closer together than those needed for the @xmath49 transitions .",
    "this hints at form factor effects being not very significant in the former decays .",

    "we argue that    * the decay channels @xmath163 as well as the transitions into the ground state @xmath9-wave bottomonia in the final state can not be controlled within the effective field theory , since higher loop contributions are expected to dominate the transitions ; * model - independent predictions can be provided for @xmath164 and radiative decays @xmath165 .",
    "the ratios for @xmath10 and @xmath166 decays into the same final states @xmath3 are consistent with the experimental data .",

    "if further experimental analysis with higher statistics could underpin this fact , it would be a very strong evidence for the molecular interpretation since such a relation can not be obtained from , e.g. , a tetraquark structure .",
    "furthermore , we calculate branching fractions for the final states @xmath4 .",
    "they are predicted to be of order @xmath169 .",
