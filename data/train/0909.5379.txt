    "it is conventionally believed that the structure of accretion environment of a strongly magnetized neutron star in an x - ray pulsar , as well as its emission , are actually governed by a few key parameters such as the neutron - star spin period and magnetic field , the binary orbital period and separation of the companions , and of course the accretion rate @xmath0 .",
    "sporadic outbursts occurring in some x - ray pulsars when the bolometric x - ray luminosity @xmath1 increases due to an enhanced accretion rate provide for the possibility of probing the observable response of such a complex system as an accreting x - ray pulsar to varying @xmath0 and getting more insight into the accretion onto a strongly magnetized neutron star and the accompanying high - energy emission .    in particular , it is known since ginga observations of the x - ray pulsar 4u0115 + 63 in 19901991 @xcite that the energies of cyclotron absorption features observed in x - ray pulsar spectra can vary with their luminosities .",
    "such variations are conventionally interpreted in terms of the luminosity dependence of the height of the line - forming region above the neutron - star surface @xcite .",
    "the correspondent negative correlation between the cyclotron - line energy and the luminosity was observed to date for several bright x - ray pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that the opposite case of the positive correlation was also registered at least for one or two x - ray pulsars ( e.g. see @xcite for her x-1 and @xcite for gx301 - 2 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that , to date , cyclotron - line parameters for all sources were mostly studied during fading phases of outbursts because of time lags between the beginning of an outburst and the start of observations .",
    "for example , it was shown by @xcite ( hereafter referred to as paper  i ) that the energy of the cyclotron line observed in spectra of the x - ray pulsar v0332 + 53 increases almost linearly with decreasing luminosity during the fading phase of an outburst in 20042005 .",
    "this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of temporal and spectral parameters of v0332 + 53 over a nearly complete powerful outburst of 20042005 , including the brightening phase studied in detail for the first time .",
    "this work employs the rxte data @xcite acquired during the observations with the following ids : 90014-xx - xx - xx , 90089-xx - xx - xx and 90427-xx - xx - xx .",
    "note that paper  i was based only on the i d 90427-xx - xx - xx data covering the fading phase of the outburst .",
    "since the aims of the present work and paper  i are slightly different , these data were reanalyzed to ensure the uniformity with the ids 90089-xx - xx - xx and 90014-xx - xx - xx corresponding to the brightening and fading phases of the outburst , respectively .    in general ,",
    "the data - analysis procedure was identical to that used in paper  i. the luminosity was calculated assuming a source distance of 7  kpc @xcite .",
    "note that the correct account of the dead time is crucial since the source count rate reached very high values . using improved software",
    ", we recalculated the luminosities for the observations in the i d  90427 set and found that the luminosities for a few brightest epochs of this set are to be lowered by about 1520% in comparison with the values published in paper  i. note , these corrections are not too large to affect the conclusions of paper  i. the time dependence of the bolometric luminosity in the photon energy range @xmath2  kev during the outburst of 20042005 is shown in fig .",
    "[ lcurve ] .",
    "all the data are naturally grouped into the brightening ( filled green squares ) and fading phases ( open blue circles ) of the outburst . for comparison , the result of integral observations",
    "are also plotted by the triangles in this figure ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the solid line is the rescaled light curve obtained with the asm monitor in the photon energy range @xmath3kev .",
    "further data reduction for both pca and hexte spectrometers was done using standard tools of ftools / lheasoft 6.3.2 package .    since the source was bright and",
    "the outburst was nearly completely covered with the rxte observations ( see fig .  [ lcurve ] ) , it is possible to obtain the high - quality broadband energy spectra of the source at different stages of the outburst and study the evolution of source parameters with the luminosity and the outburst phase . it was noted in paper  i that the best - fit cutoff energy @xmath4kev for the xspec _",
    "powerlaw@xmath5highecut _ model @xcite , which is usually used for approximation of x - ray pulsars spectra , is close to the lower limit ( @xmath63  kev ) of the pca energy range , so that the photon index can not be accurately retrieved from such a continuum model .",
    "hence , the continuum spectrum of the source was fitted with the simpler _ cutoffpl _ model which describes the source spectrum similarly well , but has fewer parameters and is free of the above limitations .",
    "the continuum spectrum was modified by one or few cyclotron - harmonic line features depending on the source luminosity .",
    "a cyclotron absorption line was fitted with the lorentz profile @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the line central energy , width , and depth , respectively .",
    "the fundamental cyclotron line ( below we ll call it  the cyclotron line  for a simplisity ) is clearly detected in all observations , whereas the second - harmonic line was confidently observed not in all data sets . in some cases ,",
    "inclusion of the third harmonic in the model affected the parameters of the second - harmonic line .",
    "the third harmonic itself was registered and its parameters can be more or less reliably retrieved only for several brightest states ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "we examined possible effects of including the second harmonic in the fit on the parameters of the cyclotron line and the continuum . in these tests ,",
    "the central energy of the second - harmonic line was either a free parameter or fixed equal to two times the central energy of the cyclotron line .",
    "it was found that the cyclotron line and continuum parameters do not depend within errors on the higher harmonics .    .",
    "this section presents the results of spectral analysis during almost entire outburst of v0332 + 53 .",
    "the analysis is focused on the source spectral parameters as functions of the luminosity and time .",
    "v0332 + 53 is one of two x - ray pulsars whose spectra exhibit at least three cyclotron - harmonic absorption line features  @xcite . in general",
    ", this source has a fairly complex , multi - component spectrum .",
    "therefore , we applied the above - described spectral model including a power law with an exponential cutoff , up to three absorption lines depending on the source brightness and  detectability ,  and the 6.4-kev iron emission line which was clearly observed in all states of the source . since the iron line was narrow and the energy resolution of the pca spectrometer at @xmath11  kev was limited ( @xmath12% ) , the actual line width can not be accurately determined",
    "thus , a fixed value of @xmath13  kev was used in the xspec data analysis .",
    "variations in the main spectral parameters with the time and the luminosity are described in detail below .",
    "it was mentioned above that variations in the cyclotron - line energy and their possible dependence on the luminosity were discovered and reported by @xcite for several bright x - ray pulsars . the cyclotron - lineenergy ",
    "sourceluminosity relation was studied in detail for the first time by @xcite for v0332 + 53 in a wide luminosity range .",
    "using integral and rxte data obtained during the fading phase of the 20042005 outburst , they discovered the strong negative correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the luminosity which can be described fairly well by a linear function .    including both the fading and brightening phases of the outburst into an analysis makes it possible to study the possible difference in the cyclotron - line behavior during these outburst stages to verify the hypothesis on the hysteretic dependence of the source parameters on its luminosity .",
    "figure  [ cycvst ] shows the temporal evolution of the cyclotron - line energy during the entire outburst .",
    "distinct asymmetry of this time profile can obviously be attributed to the asymmetry of the outburst light curve .",
    "the existence of hysteresis the cyclotron - line energy as a function of the source was checked by constructing this dependence for the entire outburst ( see fig .  [ cycvslx ] ) .",
    "the resulting plot unambiguously rules out the hysteresis hypothesis .",
    "this is valid for luminosity above @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 ( the lower - luminosity data are absent in the brightening phase ) .",
    "hence , the physics of accretion column and its emission is essentially same at both these stages .    .",
    "symbols are the same as in fig.[lcurve ] . ]    a formal linear fit of this dependence ( all available measurements have been used ) , @xmath16}\\!\\simeq\\!-\\!0.143(\\pm0.002)l_{37}\\!+\\!29.56(\\pm0.03)$ ] ( here , @xmath17 is the luminosity in the units of @xmath18  erg s@xmath15 , uncertainties correspond to a 90% confidence level ) , is practically the same as the one obtained in paper i for only the fading phase of the outburst and even takes into account the above - mentioned luminosity corrections for several highest - count - rate observations .",
    "note , however , that allowance for these corrections makes the behavior of the cyclotron energy at very high luminosities @xmath19 erg s@xmath15 slightly different from this fit : the  rate  of the cyclotron - energy variations is higher . such a difference",
    "( if any ) may be connected with possible changes in the accretion - flow structure and emission at very high luminosities then the source can transfer into other accretion regime . on the other hand ,",
    "poor statistics impedes finalizing conclusions on the behavior of the cyclotron - line energy at low luminosities below @xmath20 . some evidence is seen in fig .  [ cycvslx ] for  steepening  of the cyclotronenergy ",
    "luminosity slope below @xmath21  erg s@xmath15 , but its significance is not enough for the final conclusion .",
    "note , that the behavior of the cyclotron energy at low luminosities is very interesting from the viewpoint of determining the so - called critical luminosity at which the shock wave at the top of the accretion column disappears and/or detecting the same reverse dependence ( if any ) of the cyclotron - line energy with the luminosity as was observed for her x-1  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the lowest observed value of the cyclotron energy in the v0332 + 53 spectrum provides for an estimate for the magnetic field on the neutron - star surface .",
    "unfortunately , the lowest - luminosity data point in fig.[cycvslx ] has fairly large uncertainty .",
    "hence , it seems more expedient to use the result from the linear fit , that is 29.56 kev .",

    "it is well known from the classical stellar spectral analysis that the equivalent width of a spectral line is a very important quantity for retrieving physical parameters and conditions in the line - forming region .",
    "hence , in addition to such cyclotron - line model parameters as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , it seems expedient to have an observable quantity playing the role of cyclotron - line equivalent width in x - ray astrophysics and quantifying the total number of photons withdrawn from the continuum spectrum of a source due to resonance scattering in the cyclotron line(s ) .",
    "the main problem in calculating the cyclotron - line equivalent width is its strong dependence on the adopted continuum model to be multiplied by the line models typically used to fit cyclotron - harmonic lines .",
    "we used the following simple technique to calculate the cyclotron - line equivalent width @xmath25 : ( 1 )  all energy channels affected by the cyclotron line ( typically @xmath26  kev ) are excluded from the source spectrum ; ( 2 )  the remaining energy bins are fitted as a spectrum of the continuum ; ( 3 )  the energy bins excluded at step  1 are added again to the spectrum , their deviations from the continuum fit obtained at step  2 is calculated , and , upon normalization to the continuum spectrum , are integrated over energy ; ( 4 )  the resulting energy - integrated deviation of the normalized cyclotron - line energy bins from the continuum fit is adopted as a measure for the equivalent width @xmath25 of the cyclotron line .",
    "it was found that the quantity @xmath25 calculated in such a way is not constant , but varies with the cyclotron - line energy changes during the outburst .",
    "the @xmath25 dependence on the luminosity is shown in fig .",
    "[ eqwcycvslx ] . as in fig .",
    "[ cycvslx ] , different symbols such as filled squares and open circles correspond to the brightening and fading phases of the outburst , respectively .",
    "the cyclotron - line equivalent width decreases almost linearly with the luminosity repeating the behavior of the cyclotron - line energy itself , including the increase of the `` rate '' of the equivalent width changes at high luminosities .",
    "but it is nessesary to note , that the slope of this formal linear relation @xmath27}\\!\\propto\\!-\\!0.25l_{37}$ ] is different from that in fig.3 .",
    "it is also worthy to note the similar behaviour of the cyclotron line optical depth @xmath10 ( see filled circles in fig .",
    "[ eqwcycvslx ] ) , that can be understood from the revealed linear correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath25 .     versus cyclotron energy @xmath8 for all observed luminosities .",
    "symbols are the same as in fig.[lcurve ] . ]",
    "the correlation between the cyclotron - line energy @xmath8 and its width @xmath9 has been noted earlier in several works @xcite for a number of x - ray pulsars with different cyclotron line energies and viewing angles .",
    "the last one can play an important diagnostic role .",
    "in particular , it was used by @xcite to explain nondetection of cyclotron lines in certain objects .",
    "note , that the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 stems from both the doppler broadening due to thermal motion of electrons along the magnetic field in the line - forming region and the natural cyclotron - line broadening giving rise to broad lorentz - shaped wings of the line .",
    "the observed doppler width of the cyclotron line is  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes averaging over the duration of one observation which is typically about a few kiloseconds , i.e. , much longer than the x - ray pulsar period , @xmath30\\ ] ] is the angle between the magnetic field in the line - forming region and the observer line of sight , @xmath31 is the angle between the neutron - star spin axis and the line of sight , @xmath32 is the angle between the neutron - star spin and magnetic axes , @xmath33 is the angle between the neutron - star magnetic axis and the plane comprising the neutron - star spin axis and the line of sight , and @xmath34 is the electron temperature . in the absence of neutron - star precession effects , @xmath35 over the binary orbit .",
    "hence , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note , however , that the applied fit of the cyclotron line implies that the natural broadening implying the lorentz profile of the cyclotron line is assumed dominant . in this case , the observed relative cyclotron - line width @xmath38 is independent of the system geometry and the electron temperature in the source .",
    "in addition , the ratio @xmath39 can also be contributed by other factors , e.g. , nonuniformity of the magnetic field over the line - forming region .",
    "we examined the processed data for the presence of linear correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the cyclotron line width as a function of its energy for v0332 + 53 during its 20042005 outburst is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma_ecyc ] .",
    "no pronounced linear increase in @xmath9 with increasing @xmath8 is seen .",
    "the typical width of the cyclotron line is about @xmath40  kev .",
    "the fairly strong scatter of the data points for large cyclotron energies is probably caused by spectrum - statistics worsening at the low luminosities .",
    "this is confirmed indirectly by an increase in the error - bar sizes .",
    "an additional factor which affect to the observable broadening of the cyclotron line can be the finite energy resolution of the hexte spectrometer ( fwhm is about 5.5  kev at 30  kev ) .    finally note that according to the theory of cyclotron - radiation transfer under neutron - star conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", the optical depth at the cyclotron line varies only slightly with @xmath41 and can hardly exclude the formation of a resonance scattering feature at fairly large @xmath41 . hence , the cyclotron line nondetection should rather be related to specific viewing conditions of the line - forming region such as its small visible area or screening of this region by the neutron star and/or accretion disc / stream .",
    "it is well known that pulse profiles of x - ray pulsars are strongly dependent on the photon energy and luminosity .",
    "this is especially prominent in soft energy bands strongly affected by the intrinsic absorption in the binary .",
    "as the photon energy increases toward the hard x - ray range , the observed emission becomes progressively less sensitive to the poorly known environment of the accreting neutron star and carries more and more imprints of actual physical and geometrical parameters in hot polar - cap regions on the neutron star where this radiation is generated .",
    "although these regions are believed to be much simpler in structure and physics , strong changes of pulse profiles are observed in their hard x - ray emission , as well . in particular , this was demonstrated by @xcite who used integral data to reconstruct uniformly the pulse profiles of ten bright x - ray pulsars in hard x - rays for different luminosities and study their variability .",
    "this section is aimed at answering the question on the absence or presence of pulse - profile hysteretic behavior during the brightening and fading phases of the outburst from v0332 + 53 .",
    "it was shown in the previous sections that the source spectrum and its parameters are practically the same at the outburst stages with the same luminosity .",
    "taking into account the similarity of pulse profiles at the same luminosities for the brightening and fading phases of an outburst from 4u0115 + 63  @xcite we can expect the similar behavior for v0332 + 53 .",
    "according to paper  i , the main mystery of the considered source is the drastic change of its pulse profile near the cyclotron line . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the pulse profile in the high - luminosity state ( @xmath42 ) has a sinusoidal double - peaked shape at all energies .",
    "the relative intensities of the pulses are slightly different .",
    "very small variations in the positions of the peaks depending on the photon energy range were observed . as the pulsar luminosity decreases , the pulse profile changes significantly . in the soft energy bands ( at photon energies less",
    "then @xmath43  kev ) it becomes nearly single - peaked .",
    "one the intra - peak gap disappears and the double - peaked profile transforms into an asymmetrical single - peaked one at energies near the cyclotron line . then the pulse profile becomes double - peaked again with the further increase in the photon energy .    here , all the data covering the outburst of 20042005 , including the i d  90427 used in paper i , are reanalyzed uniformly and a detailed comparison of pulse profiles corresponding to the same luminosities during the outburst brightening and fading phases is made .",
    "it is found that they are similar to each other ( minor differences may only exist in the softest energy band @xmath44  kev ) and their behavior with the luminosity identical to the described above .",
    "note , that for several highest - luminosity observations it was impossible to produce the pulse profiles using pca data due to the absence of data modes with sufficient energy and time resolution below 20  kev .",
    "for illustrative purposes the pulse profiles in different energy bands for the observation 90089 - 11 - 02 - 03 ( the luminosity was @xmath45  erg s@xmath15 at the brightening phase ) are shown in fig.[pp_2d ] .",
    "the pca channels correspond to @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48  kev to demonstrate changes at soft photon energies and the transition from single- to double - peak shape .",
    "following paper i , the hard energy channels ( hexte data ) were chosen to divide the cyclotron line in equal parts .    .",
    "position of the cyclotron line center is shown by the dashed line .",
    "red colour corresponds to higher and blue to lower relative intensities .",
    "solid lines represent levels of equal intensity : 0.20 , 0.24 , 0.28 , ... , 0.96 , 1.00 . ]",
    "it is seen that relatively far from the cyclotron energy equal to @xmath49  kev for this observation , the pulse profile is double - peaked with a domination of a second peak in the photon energy range @xmath50  kev . in the left (  soft  ) wing of the cyclotron line the profile is become single - peaked with its center at the pulse phase of @xmath51 . in the right (  hard  ) wing of the cyclotron line",
    "the profile is also single - peaked , but the position of its maximum is shifted to the pulse phase @xmath52 . at the higher energies the pulse profile becomes double - peaked again .",
    "note , that the observed shifting of the peak over the phase near the cyclotron line energy is occurred gradually with increasing photon energy .",
    "these features can be seen clearly in fig.[pp3d ] plotted using the technique described in detail in paper i.    note that the observed pulse profile is contributed by three main components : ( i )  direct radiation coming from one or two under - the - shock hot polar columns which produce(s ) the continuum and hosts the cyclotron - line - forming region being presumably the upper part of the column adjacent to the shock , ( ii )  forward - scattered radiation outgoing from the side of the accretion stream feeding the `` front '' ( directly visible ) polar column and ( iii )  backward - scattered radiation outgoing from the side of the accretion stream feeding the `` back '' ( neutron - star shaded ) polar column .",
    "quantitative pulse - profile modeling is a complicated problem requiring good knowledge of the features of radiation beaming near the cyclotron frequency @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown by @xcite that the accretion column beam function at the cyclotron energy is significantly different from the radiation beaming at other energies .",
    "it was already observed that the pulsed fraction @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are maximum and minimum intensities in the pulse profile of an x - ray pulsar , respectively , increases with energy in the hard x - rays ( @xmath56  kev ) for all studied sources ( see e.g. @xcite and a last review of @xcite and references therein ) . however , this increase in not monotonic for some sources and shows such local features as , e.g. , maxima near the cyclotron lines .",
    "the pulsed fraction as a function of the photon energy was studied in detail in a wide energy band ( @xmath2 kev ) for the pulsar 4u0115 + 63 using the rxte data @xcite .",
    "it was found in this paper that ( i )  the pulsed fraction increases with the photon energy and decreased with the luminosity and ( ii )  the local pf maxima ( hump - like features ) exist not only near the cyclotron line , but also near the higher harmonics .",
