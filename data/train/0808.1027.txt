    "exclusive production of heavy @xmath4 vector quarkonium states in hadronic interactions was never measured , but is very attractive from the theoretical side . due to the negative charge - parity of the vector meson ,",
    "the pomeron - pomeron fusion mechanism of exclusive meson production is not available , and instead the production will proceed via photon  pomeron fusion . a possible purely hadronic mechanism would involve the elusive odderon exchange .",
    "currently there is no compelling evidence for the odderon , and here we restrict ourselves to the photon - pomeron fusion mechanism .",
    "the current experimental analyses at the tevatron ( see , for example , the plenary talk @xcite ) call for an evaluation of differential distributions including the effects of absorptive corrections .",
    "predictions for tevatron require the diffractive amplitude for @xmath0",
    ". this process has been measured at hera in the energy range @xmath5 100 - 200 gev @xcite .",
    "this energy range is in fact very much relevant to the exclusive production at tevatron energies for not too large rapidities of the meson .",
