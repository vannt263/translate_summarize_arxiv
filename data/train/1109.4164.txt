    "the main aim of this paper is to establish several general tools for measuring how far a particular log canonical singularity is from being cm ( cohen - macaulay ) or rational .",

    "thus , each non - rational center @xmath7 is an irreducible subvariety of @xmath3 , by definition .",
    "let @xmath0 be a klt pair ( see section  [ sec : preliminaries ] below for all standard definitions ) .",
    "then @xmath9 for @xmath8 and @xmath3 has rational singularities , hence @xmath3 is cm .",
    "as mentioned above , log canonical does not imply rational or cm : the simplest example is provided by the cone over an abelian surface in which case @xmath10 is supported at the vertex and @xmath3 is also not cm .",
    "our first main theorem is the following :    [ thm : centers ] let @xmath0 be a log canonical pair .",
    "then every non - rational center of @xmath3 is a non - klt center of @xmath0 .",
    "a similar result was independently proven in @xcite .",
    "note that in @xcite the terminology `` irrational centers '' is used instead of non - rational centers .",
    "note that the the closed set of non - rational singularities is a subset of the closed set of non - klt singularities , but ( [ thm : centers ] ) is far from being obvious .",
    "it is natural to assume that the failure of log canonical pairs to be cm can be described in terms of the non - rational centers .",
    "there are several ways to measure this failure .",

    "a more subtle difference is provided by the following example .",
    "let @xmath31 be the cone over an abelian surface and let @xmath56 .",

    "however , @xmath3 is @xmath57 at every closed point @xmath59 : @xmath60 is @xmath57 if and only if the hyperplane section @xmath61 is @xmath62 , which is true since @xmath31 is normal .",
    "thus @xmath3 is @xmath20 but not @xmath57 .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath63 , the property @xmath12 is stronger than @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , knowing that a certain class of varieties satisfies @xmath14 allows to conclude the property @xmath12 for this class indirectly , as follows .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for an application of this principle . )",
    "if @xmath3 is not @xmath12 at the generic point of a subvariety @xmath64 then a general hyperplane section @xmath65 is not @xmath12 at the generic points of @xmath66 .",
    "cutting down this way , we get to a variety which is not @xmath14 , and this process preserves other nice properties of @xmath3 , such as being log canonical .",
    "the reason why the condition @xmath14 is so convenient to work with for projective varieties is the following simple cohomological criterion :    [ lem : hartshorne ] let @xmath13 be a coherent sheaf on a projective scheme @xmath3 with an ample invertible sheaf @xmath67 , over an algebraically closed field . then @xmath13 is @xmath14 if and only if @xmath68 for any @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this is basically proved in ( * ? ? ?",

    "assuming @xmath94 , the cone @xmath3 satisfies condition @xmath14 if and only if @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "this follows from the interpretation of the depth in terms of the local cohomology groups @xmath97 and the fact that @xmath98 for @xmath99 by the kawamata - viehweg vanishing and serre duality .    in particular ,",
    "if @xmath31 is an abelian surface then @xmath3 is not @xmath20 at the vertex @xmath88 , but if @xmath31 is a k3 or enriques surface then @xmath31 _ is _ @xmath20 .",
