    "in the present paper we continue a study of the onset of the perturbative qcd regime in the processes initiated by virtual photon @xmath13 along the lines of @xcite .",
    "one may address two types of hard processes which allow one to study the transition regime from the strong - qcd physics to the perturbative qcd physics of hard processes at accessible energies : these are ( i ) hard hadronic form factors @xcite , and ( ii ) pomeron - dominated reactions @xcite .",
    "an important problem which arises in the quantitative description of hard processes is a numerical determination of the scale at which the perturbative regime starts to dominate the amplitudes of interest .",
    "much attention to this subject has been paid in connection with the elastic form factors @xcite . in particular",
    ", the authors of @xcite advocated the viewpoint of an early applicability of pqcd at considerably low @xmath2 , whereas in @xcite the arguments in favour of the late onset of the perturbative regime , at very large @xmath14 gev@xmath9 , were given .",
    "a quantitative study of @xcite confirmed the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite and showed that even at @xmath2 as large as @xmath15 gev@xmath9 the form factor is still dominated by the soft non - perturbative region of the @xmath5 kinematical configurations .",
    "in @xcite the elastic pion and transition form factors were studied at @xmath16 gev@xmath9 within an approach where both the truly non - perturbative and perturbative contributions have been taken into account .",
    "namely , the form factor has been represented as a sum of the triangle diagram ( direct convolution of soft wave functions ) and diagrams with the one - gluon exchanges ( the convolution of hard one - gluon exchange kernel with soft wave functions ) .",
    "the analysis of form factors in the region of small @xmath17 gev@xmath9 allowed us to reconstruct phenomenological soft wave functions of pseudoscalar mesons and soft photon .",
    "it was found that the diagrams with the one - gluon exchange ( the terms of the order of @xmath18 ) started to dominate the form factor only at @xmath19 gev@xmath9 , whereas at smaller @xmath2 the contribution of non - perturbative triangle diagram was substantial .    in this work",
    "we address diffractive production by the hard photon , namely the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "one would have in mind the following physical picture of such processes at asymptotically large @xmath2 : the virtual photon produces @xmath5 pair at small distances ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , then the quarks convert into vector meson ( or outgoing photon ) with the @xmath20-channel emission of gluons : the gluons at the top of the ladder are at relatively small distances and thus a hard component of the pomeron ( i.e. the bfkl pomeron @xcite ) is selected .",
    "the lower part of the gluon ladder is attached to the nucleon at small momentum transfer , and thus the region of small transverse momenta is selected at the bottom of the ladder .",
    "hence the most realistic is the following scenario of the whole reaction : typical virtualities in the gluon ladder change from hard values selected by the virtual photon in the hard quark - loop at the top of the ladder to the soft values at the bottom , and thus the whole @xmath20-channel behavior is determined by the complicated object which is a superposition of the hard and the soft pomerons .",
    "the details of the partition of the whole @xmath20-channel amplitude into the hard and soft components depend on the values of @xmath2 and specific details of the selection of the hard component of the pomeron by the quark loop .",
    "that is why a detailed consideration of the hard upper quark - antiquark subprocess based on realistic wave functions of the initial photon and the outgoing vector meson is crucial for the understanding of the mechanism of the reaction at large but finite @xmath2 .",
    "notice that the interest in better understanding of the diffractive production mechanism is also motivated by the experimental resutls .",
    "experimentally a rather strong change of the @xmath21-dependence of the cross section of the reactions initiated by the photon in different regions of the photon virtuality has been observed : namely , the @xmath21 dependence of the cross section of the photoproduction ( @xmath22 ) in the region @xmath23 gev@xmath9 is rather flat , similar to that in hadronic processes like @xmath24 .",
    "however , the reaction @xmath25 at @xmath26 gev@xmath9 demonstrates an increase of the cross section with @xmath21 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "an attractive possibility one might think of is to refer this growth to the change of the pomeron regime from the strong - qcd one at small @xmath2 to the bfkl one at large @xmath2 .",
    "however , for better understanding of this phenomenon one needs a more detailed quantitative analysis of the different ingredients of a complicated amplitude of the diffractive production .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the quark block with a coupled photon , @xmath29 , which is responsible for a selection of the region of small separations and thus of the hard pomeron component .",
    "the quark block is determined by the convolution of photon wave functions ( the reaction @xmath1 ) or convolution of the photon and @xmath6-meson wave functions ( the reaction @xmath0 ) .",
    "the light - cone wave function of photon was found in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of experimental data for the transition form factor @xmath30 at @xmath31 gev@xmath9 @xcite ; this wave function was successfully applied for the description of data on @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the transition form factors has been performed in terms of the double spectral representation over @xmath5 invariant mass squared , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the components of the light - cone quark momenta , and @xmath37 is the constituent quark mass .",
    "the photon wave function is represented as a sum of two components which correspond to a direct production of the @xmath5 pair with a point - like vertex @xmath38 at large @xmath39 , and to the production in the low-@xmath40 region where the vertex has a nontrivial structure due to the soft @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the soft @xmath5 interaction yields an enhancement of the contribution of low - masses and respectively large distances in the quark loop .    with the light - cone wave function of the photon at hand we can calculate longitudinal and transverse polarization cross sections @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the onset of pqcd regime depends on the selection of small interquark separations in a quark loop with @xmath2 .",
    "so , it is important to test which fraction of the cross - section as a function of @xmath2 is actually gained at small transverse separations .",
    "therefore , in parallel with calculating the @xmath43 cross section which includes contribution of all transverse separations in the quark - loop coupled to the bfkl pomeron , we also calculate the part of this cross section which is actually gained at small @xmath5 distances @xmath44 fm . strictly speaking , only this part of the cross section probes the bfkl pomeron , whereas the cross section where the quarks in the loop are at large distances should be rather coupled to the soft strong - qcd pomeron .    the results of our analysis show that in the region @xmath45 gev@xmath9 the @xmath1 cross section is dominated by the domain of large transverse quark separations .",
    "the small quark separations in the loop start to dominate the cross section only at @xmath46 gev@xmath9 and @xmath47 .",
    "this means that @xmath29 selects small distances in the @xmath48-pomeron vertex approximately at the same values of @xmath2 as it was in the pion elastic and transition @xmath49 form factors .",
    "the @xmath6-meson wave function necessary for the description of the reaction @xmath0 is not known promptly , so we have to use some assumptions concerning the details of its behavior .",
    "the low-@xmath40 component of the @xmath6-meson wave function is supposed to be approximately the same as for a pion .",
    "the latter was found in @xcite from fitting the data for pion form factor at @xmath50 gev@xmath9 @xcite . moreover , the @xmath6-meson low-@xmath39 wave function should be close to photon s one due to the vector - meson dominance .",
    "the high - mass component of the @xmath51-meson wave function needs a special discussion : for its calculation , we can not apply exactly the same procedure as for the pion form factor . in the analysis of pion form factor @xcite ,",
    "all the corrections of the order of @xmath18 were taken into account . to this end",
    ", the wave function of the pion was splitted into soft and hard components , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in the following way @xmath54 the parameter @xmath55 , which separates the soft and hard regions , is expected to be of the order of several gev ; in @xcite the value @xmath56 gev was chosen : this corresponds to @xmath57 at @xmath58 mev .",
    "the separation of soft and hard wave functions was done in a simplest way using the step - function : @xmath59 the hard component @xmath53 is a convolution of the soft wave function @xmath52 and hard gluon exchange kernel @xmath60 : @xmath61 the splitting of the wave function into the soft and hard components yields the following expansion of the form factor over @xmath18 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the soft form factor , and @xmath64 is the soft - hard contribution of the order @xmath65 which is determined by the diagram with the hard gluon exchange , eq .",

    "4 ) .    a proper consideration of all the @xmath18 terms in the reaction",
    "@xmath66 is a much more complicated task since such terms appear not only as corrections to the @xmath6-meson vertex but also as the next - to - leading order corrections to the bfkl - pomeron @xcite and pomeron-@xmath5 vertex .",
    "such kind of analysis lies beyond the scope of our present work . at the same time",
    ", the calculation of the @xmath0 amplitude with taking into account only a part of the @xmath18 corrections is not consistent .",
    "in this situation , it seems reasonable to consider two extreme cases of the behavior of the @xmath67 vertex at large @xmath68 : first , @xmath69 and second @xmath70 . in both considered cases the dominance of the region of small interquark separations @xmath7 fm",
    "was not observed at least at @xmath71 gev@xmath9 and @xmath47 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section ii we discuss the kinematics of the reaction , the lorentz structure of the amplitudes and some principal points of the spectral representations .",
    "section iii presents a detailed calculation of the amplitudes in the framework of the spectral representations over the invariant @xmath5-mass .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in section iv . in conclusion",
    "we summarize the main results and present our viewpoint on the strong - qcd pomeron and the electoproduction of vector mesons at @xmath72 gev@xmath9 .",
    "in this section we describe the kinematics of the reaction and outline the principle points in the dispersive representation of the amplitude .",
    "further technical details and final analytical expressions are given in the next section .",
    "we use the following notation for the four - vector of the particles involved : the initial virtual photon four - momentum @xmath73 , the final virtual photon ( or vector meson ) four - momentum @xmath74 , the target nucleon momentum @xmath75 , and the outgoing nucleon momentum @xmath76 .",
    "the following momentum conservations are imposed : @xmath77 the reaction is characterized by three independent kinematical variables @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , since @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 or @xmath84 for @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in the kinematics when @xmath85 it is convenient to describe the process in the reference frame where the target nucleon is at rest @xmath86 and photon fastly moving along the longitudinal axis @xmath87 .",
    "the kinematical conditions ( [ kin ] ) then imply that @xmath88 and omitting the @xmath89 terms we come to the following expressions for the momentum and polarization vectors of the incoming photon @xmath90 for the outgoing vector meson in the reaction @xmath83 , one has @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in the limit @xmath94 , the momenta @xmath95 and @xmath96 are equal to @xmath97 similar expressions",

    "the reactions of the @xmath233-meson diffractive production are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the calculation of the quark - loop diagram @xmath234 turns out to be rather ambiguous due to the uncertainty in the large-@xmath39 behaviour of the @xmath6-meson vertex @xmath235 .",
    "because of that , we analyze several possibilities of the large-@xmath39 behaviour of the vertex @xmath236 .",
    "the results for the two variants , namely ( 1 ) @xmath237 and ( 2 ) @xmath238 ( see fig .",
    "3b ) , are represented by solid lines in fig .",
    "8 .    in order to check the consistency of our initial assumption that at the considered @xmath2 and @xmath21 the ampitude is dominated by the small separations of the gluons in the ladder , and thus the bfkl form of the kernel should be used we have also performed calculations introducing explicitly a @xmath239-function cut into the bfkl - amplitude integrand of ( 49 ) : this @xmath239-function measures an actual contribution of the hard region of separations smaller than 0.2 fm : @xmath240 the cross sections constrained by ( [ 0.2fm ] ) are shown in figs . 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 by dashed lines",
    ": one can see that for all reactions the selection of small distances , if any , occurs very slowly with the increase of @xmath2 . only at @xmath241 gev@xmath242 ,",
    "the 80% of the cross sections are actually gained in the hard region .",
    "thus we conclude that the dominance of the hard region can not be expected earlier than at @xmath243 gev@xmath242 .",
    "let us notice that the situation with the diffractive production by the hard photon in the region of @xmath244 100 gev@xmath9 turns out to be quite similar to the situation with the elastic meson form factor at @xmath245 10 - 20 gev@xmath9 : in the latter case one can expect the dominance of the hard - scattering mechanism ( which is proved to be the dominant mechanism at asymptotically large @xmath2 ) also at @xmath2 of several gev@xmath9 .",
    "assuming such dominance at several @xmath2 one determines the soft wave function of the pion at low normalization point by descrining the data on the form factor and finds for this wave function a double - humped form @xcite .",
    "however , analyzing the content of the calculated form factor , one finds that the bulk of the contribution actually comes from the end - point region where the hard - scattering mechanism is not applicable but rather the feynman mechanism works @xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that the pertutbative treatment of the form factor at several gev@xmath9 is not consistent ( or at least the perturbative mechanism can not give a bulk of the form factor ) and that the soft physics actually dominates in the kinematical region @xmath246 gev@xmath9 .",
    "likewise , we have found that the assumption of the bfkl form of the pomeron kernel actually yields in the region of @xmath247 gev@xmath9 the cross section which is at 80% level gained in the region of _ large _ transverse separations in the quark loop .",
    "the latter are equal to gluon separations at the top of the gluon ladder which thus turns out to be in the soft regime just from the top . therefore , similar to the elastic form factor case , we have to conclude that the perturbative treatment in this range of @xmath2 is not consistent and that rather the soft pomeron should be used .",
    "considering the region of @xmath248 100 gev@xmath9 , we have observed that the dominance of the region of small separations in the quark loop depends on the subtle details of the calculation procedure : namely , some of the variants of the calculation discussed here yield the cross sections @xmath249 and @xmath250 which differ even at very large @xmath2 : this means that the region @xmath251 fm still gives a non - vanishing contribution even at asymptotically large @xmath2 .",
    "more detailed and technical explanation is as follows :    it might happen that the spectral representation of the quark loop was superconvergent , i.e. the factor @xmath252 in the denominator was not essential for the convergence of the integral .",
    "then the denominator @xmath253 could be safely expanded in powers of @xmath254 , namely , @xmath255 .",
    "then one would not observe any selection of the hard region even at asymptotically large @xmath2 : the @xmath2 dependence would just factorize and the integrals would be still dominated by typical hadronic scales .    in the reactions ( [ gamma1 ] ) and ( [ gamma2 ] ) , choosing the scale @xmath231 for the @xmath230-dependence , one observes the cross sections @xmath256 and @xmath250 to be very close to each other at @xmath257 gev@xmath9 ( see figs . 4 and 6 ) .",
    "this means that the spectral representations are not superconvergent and thus the hard photon actually selects small distances in the quark loop and , as a result , the top of the pomeron ladder is in the perturbative regime .",
    "the introduction of the scale - factor @xmath258 provides a superconvergence of the spectral integrals , thus making the cross sections @xmath259 and @xmath250 different even at @xmath260 .",
    "in other words , small separations are not selected in this variant of calculation even at asymptotically large @xmath2 .",
    "the similar situation is observed in the diffractive vector meson production reactions ( [ rho1 ] ) and ( [ rho2 ] ) .    namely , for the variant @xmath261 at @xmath262 ( see fig . 8)",
    "the integrals are not superconvergent and thus small separations dominate the amplitude at large @xmath2 .",
    "the only quantitative difference with the photon production case is that the proximity of cross sections @xmath259 and @xmath263 , with the scale @xmath231 , comes later with the increase of @xmath2 .    for the variant",
    "@xmath264 the spectral representations are superconvergent and there is no dominance of the small separations in the quark loop even at asymptotically large @xmath2 ; correspondingly , the contribution of distances @xmath251 fm is always important in this variant .",
    "low-@xmath39 structure of @xmath265 and @xmath266 is very important in realistic treatment of reactions @xmath83 and @xmath267 : it is seen in comparing figs .",
    "low-@xmath39 structure is essential for different behaviour of @xmath268 and @xmath269 in the region of small @xmath270 at @xmath271 gev@xmath9 .",
    "let us discuss now in a more detail the role of large and small @xmath68 in the formation of cross sections initiated by @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "the distinction of corresponding cross sections is due to a different structure of the spin - dependent factors , @xmath274 and @xmath275 , related to the loop diagrams ( see ( [ ssp2 ] ) and ( [ sssp2 ] ) : for the case of longitudinal polarization the spin dependent factor is @xmath276 , whereas @xmath277 at @xmath278 or @xmath279 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath280 , the large masses , i.e. the regions @xmath281 and @xmath282 , become dominant for the reactions @xmath283 and @xmath284 , but there is no such dominance for the reactions with @xmath272 .",
    "this means that in the transitions @xmath285 @xmath286 small @xmath68 or large interquark separations contribute considerably .",
    "the realistic photon wave function also enhances the role of the large interquark distances , thus resulting in a different behaviour of the cross sections @xmath287 and @xmath288 at @xmath289 gev@xmath9 in the region @xmath290 gev@xmath9 ( compare fig . 4c and fig .",
    "the performed calculations demonstrate that a selection of small distances by the virtual photon @xmath29 with the increase of @xmath2 have the following features : first , it strongly depends on the choice of the @xmath230-scale .",
    "second , it proceeds very slowly : in the quark loops for the transitions @xmath291 and @xmath292 the soft interquark distances @xmath293 fm clearly dominate the amplitude at @xmath294 gev@xmath9 .",
    "the situation here is quite similar to that of meson elastic form factors , where the pqcd regime starts to dominate at @xmath19 gev@xmath9 only ( see the results for the pion and transition form factors in @xcite and a general discussion in @xcite ) . from this point of view , the results of our analysis @xcite and the present paper seem to be quite consistent with each other .",
    "the late onset of the pqcd in the reaction @xmath25 means that it is the strong - qcd pomeron that actually works at @xmath295 gev@xmath9 , thus exposing an intriguing situation with vector meson electroproduction processes .",
    "the matter is that the @xmath21-dependence of the photoproduction reactions ( @xmath22 ) in the region @xmath23 gev is rather flat , similar to that in hadronic processes like @xmath24 .",
    "however , the reaction @xmath25 at @xmath26 gev@xmath9 demonstrates a different @xmath21-dependence : namely , the cross sections increase as @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "there might be an attractive possibility to refer this growth to the change of the pomeron regime from the strong - qcd one in the first case to the bfkl pomeron in the second one .",
    "however the results of our analysis show that the bfkl pomeron can not be seen in the diffractive production in the region @xmath244 100 gev@xmath9 .",
    "therefore , a theoretical explanation of the change of the @xmath21 dependence lies in better understanding of properties of the strong - qcd pomeron .",
    "one of the possibilities is to explain this change of the @xmath21 dependence by a complicated heterogeneous structure of the strong - qcd pomeron , when its different components reveal themselves at @xmath296 and @xmath297 gev@xmath9 .",
    "for example , one may suggest the following scenarios for the strong - qcd pomeron :    * in the reactions with @xmath298 as well as hadronic processes @xmath299 or @xmath300 , the amplitude is governed by the pomeron with intercept close to unity : @xmath301 , with @xmath302 ( ktdl - pomeron @xcite ) . in this case , the ktdl - pomeron contribution must vanish at @xmath303 gev@xmath9 leaving the leading role to a new pole with a larger intercept , @xmath304 @xcite . * in the reactions with @xmath298 as well as hadronic processes @xmath299 or @xmath300 , the amplitude is determined by multiple primary - pomeron - induced rescatterings in the direct channel @xcite .",
    "a slow growth of the amplitudes at @xmath23 gev , @xmath305 , occurs at rather large value of the primary pomeron intercept , @xmath306 @xcite . in this scenario , in order to obtain the growth of the electroproduction amplitudes observed in the experiment , @xmath307 , the multiple rescatterings should die with the increase of @xmath2 in such a way that at moderately large @xmath2 only the one - pomeron exchange survives , leading to the amplitude growth @xmath308 .",
    "however a detailed consideration of the strong - qcd pomeron is beyond the scope of this article and we leave this intriguing subject to other publications .",
