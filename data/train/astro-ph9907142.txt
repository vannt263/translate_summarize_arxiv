    "it is well known that every spiral galaxy consists of three main parts : central bulge , disk and dark halo ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this letter",
    "we wish to investigate in more detail the idea that the halo of our galaxy , milky way ( in the further text also denoted as the galaxy ) is made mainly of two components : _ baryonic _ ( machos , see the discussion later ) and _ non - baryonic _ ( massive neutrinos with the mass @xmath3 ev ) , and impact of such a composition of matter on the shape of the halo .",
    "the problem of the mass composition in spiral galaxies is well known and still unsolved ( e.g.  ref .",
    "rotation curve of the galaxy ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and non - existence of the keplerian fall - off points out that there exists a large amount of matter that still has to be accounted for .",
    "it is a general opinion that a bulk of this matter resides in the dark halo of each spiral galaxy ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although there are opposite standpoints that suggest the modification of the newtonian dynamics ( mond ) ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) that recently produced quite good agreements with the observations of 15 rotation curves ( ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "massive neutrinos remain viable candidates for the `` missing light '' problem ( as defined by schramm and steigman @xcite ) .",
    "it can be shown that under certain assumptions ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) massive neutrinos with the mass of the order of 30 ev can account for the mass in spiral galaxies ( e.g.  ref .",
    "these neutrinos play the central role in the decaying dark matter ( ddm ) theory usually associated with the name of dennis w. sciama @xcite .",
    "one of the major motivations for undertaking this research is recent work of the present authors ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , who marshalled lots of evidence pointing to a moderately flattened dark halo @xmath4 for both our galaxy and spiral galaxies in general . most of those arguments apply to an essentially baryonic ( macho or gaseous ) halo , but some are applicable to the general dynamically dominant halo component .",
    "sciama s ddm theory is among the plausible and interesting theories predicting an extreme @xmath5 flattening for the dark neutrino component .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of machos detected through microlensing searches does not automatically discard the ddm theory , neither its applications in the galactic context .",
    "it is still possible ( albeit more and more difficult to maintain ) that machos are dynamically insignificant or only marginally significant .",
    "the estimates of the macho contribution to the cosmological mass density are still dependent on several not completely watertight assumptions @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss some possibilities for a combined ddm + macho model in the section 4 .",
    "according to the ddm theory it is assumed that neutrinos do have masses and that the more massive neutrino , @xmath6 radiatively decays into a photon and less massive neutrino , @xmath7 : @xmath8 ( e.g. ref .",
    "if one further wishes to discuss the kinematics of this equation , one would obtain the following simple relation @xcite : @xmath9 where greek letters in indices are related to the various types of neutrinos , i.e. tau , electron and mu neutrinos .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath10 therefore giving the following simple relation : @xmath11    the basic values of the ddm theory are the following ( ref .",
    "@xcite , updates in ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    * according to the latest estimates the mass is : @xmath12 ev .",
    "* these neutrinos decay radiatively with the lifetime @xmath13",
    "s. for the latest correction of this value , see the discussion later ( based upon ref .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "a decay photon energy is @xmath14 ev ( obtained from the eq .",
    "[ [ egammasimple ] ] ) , so these photons can ionize hydrogen , but not helium .",
    "the significant flattening of the halo was introduced by binney , may and ostriker ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) who found that it is likely that if the kinematics of the objects in the halo are similar to the kinematics of the extreme population ii objects , then the massive halo should have the axis ratio @xmath15 .",
    "one can now define the flattening parameter @xmath16 as @xmath17 , i.e.  its cosine determines the shape of the halo @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath18 notation is related to @xmath19 as @xmath20 .    as for the ddm theory ,",
    "sciama @xcite proposed that the dark halo had to be extremely flattened @xmath21 , in order to obtain scale height of electrons responsible for pulsar dispersion that is determined by the scale height of the dark matter ( i.e.  massive neutrinos ) . by scale",
    "height we assume the column density on one side of the galactic plane divided by the volume density in the plane . later on , sciama @xcite argued that the scale height of the ionized gas should be reduced to @xmath22 pc , thus eliminating the need of the strongly flattened halo .",
    "however , nordgren , cordes and terzian @xcite found that the electron scale height is @xmath23 pc , and the mean electron density for the interstellar medium @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "this is also in accordance with earlier results of cordes et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this leads us to important questions concerning the ionization problem in the spiral galaxies ( e.g.  refs .",
    "we just mention here that the conventional sources such as o stars or supernovae have much smaller scale heights ( @xmath26 pc ) than the aforementioned ones of the free electron component of the interstellar matter .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we start with the equation that represents ionization equilibrium : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the neutrino density near the sun , @xmath29 is the free electron density , @xmath30 is the predicted value of the decaying neutrino lifetime and @xmath31 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient excluding transition directly to the ground state ( cf .",
    "if one adopts @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath25 this leads to the following neutrino density : @xmath35 where @xmath30 is expressed as @xmath36 s. this can give the following value of the mass density @xmath37 , assuming the neutrino mass of @xmath38 ev : @xmath39 where we , as usual , expressed mass density in the solar masses ( @xmath40 g ) over cubic parsec ( 1 pc @xmath41 cm ) .",
    "now we can see why the extremely flattened halo was needed in the ddm theory ; namely using equation ( [ equila ] ) one has : @xmath42 that gives , after inserting appropriate values , the value for the electron density : @xmath43 where we put sciama s value @xmath44 @xmath25 ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) and let lifetime to take the values @xmath45 s. one can see that there are two ways to achieve agreement of theory with observations : one can either increase @xmath46 as suggested by sciama ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , by reducing the assumed scale height of the neutrino distribution of 8 kpc by a factor of @xmath47 to @xmath48 kpc which means that one must introduce extremely flattened halo , or , as we will show one can assume modified form of the equation ( [ equila ] ) ( see the discussion later ) .",
    "we first note that we obtained lower value than sciama ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) for @xmath37 , @xmath49 vs. @xmath50 , because we used nordgren et al .",
    "@xcite ) lower value for @xmath29 ( 0.033 @xmath25 ) , rather than sciama ( 0.04 @xmath25 ) . in the section",
    ", we shall see that this has profound consequences for flattening , even if we accept all other sciama s premises .",
    "we would like now to investigate the general applicability of the decay  ionization equilibrium equation , and in order to do it , we would like to isolate all possible sources of uncertainty .",
    "therefore we propose the following improvements concerning equation ( [ equila ] ) :    \\1 ) additional ionizing sources should be taken into account , regardless on the assumed scale height",
    ". these can be o and b stars ( the question of galactic disks opacity not being completely clear at present ) , as discussed , for instance , by mathis @xcite and others @xcite , metagalactic background , cosmic rays , large - scale shocks , etc .    in this case",
    ", the equation for decay - ionization equilibrium ( [ equila ] ) should read @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ionizing contribution of all other sources .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath53 i.e.  required neutrino density is _",
    "decreased_. accordingly , @xmath37 is also decreased , and necessity for flattening is decreased , as we shall see in more detail below .",
    "\\2 ) assumption of `` maximal neutrino '' halo is unwarranted , even if desirable .",
    "the discovery of machos , and substantial mass contribution of these objects to the required dynamical mass of the galaxy ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , immediately invalidates this assumption .",
    "so far , using the notation of the sciama @xcite , we have to use the decomposition @xmath54 accordingly , the required lengthscale is decreased by a factor @xmath55 this offers an interesting opportunity of building of more complex model incorporating other observed phenomena .",
    "if we suppose that the rest of dynamical mass of the milky way halo is made of baryonic machos of the same population as the one detected in the microlensing searches , then one should be able , in principle , to tightly constraint the parameter @xmath56 , i.e. the decaying neutrino fraction of the dynamical mass .",
    "this is to be achieved by simultaneous consideration of ( i ) microlensing optical depths and their ratios in various directions , which would put constraints on the shape of the macho component @xcite ; ( ii ) ionization of reynolds layer as in the present paper ; and ( iii ) constraints on the macho abundance stemming from the big bang nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "we consider this to be a good bargain , since for price of introducing one additional parameter ( @xmath56 ratio ) in the theory , we get multiple advantages : accounting for observed microlensing events and baryonic dark matter on one hand , and non - baryonic dark matter on the other , as well as retaining some advantages of the classical ddm theory , like explanation of cosmological reionization . therefore , in the course of future work , we shall try to show how this extension can be specifically realized .",
    "\\3 ) column density uncertainty ( @xmath57 may vary within a factor or @xmath48 ) is introduced .",
    "\\4 ) galactocentric distance of the sun , as well as the rotational velocity of the lsr are still subject to some uncertainty ( e.g.  ref.@xcite ) .",
    "\\5 ) the least significant source of uncertainty is the uncertainty in the mass of decaying neutrino .",
    "it is manifested in transition from the neutrino number - density ( as a discrete value quantifying ionization equilibrium ) to the mass - density distribution .",
    "now we pass to determination of the flattening parameter of the neutrino halo , using the method and notation of sciama @xcite .",
    "the vertical lengthscale can be written as @xmath58 flattening parameter @xmath19 can be approximated as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the lengthscale in the galactic plane . if we accept the usual form of softened isothermal distribution of neutrino dark matter @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the core radius .",
    "horizontal lengthscale is , then , given as @xmath63 thus , we obtain the general expression for flattening parameter in the `` maximal neutrino '' halo assumption with additional ionizing sources : @xmath64 for @xmath65 kpc , we obtain @xmath66 \\right\\}^{-1}.\\ ] ] now we have cast the problem in the most tractable form .",
    "one may see that the following assumptions    1 .",
    "purely ddm ionization ( @xmath67 ) , 2 .",
    "desirable lifetime of the unstable particle ( @xmath68 ) , and 3 .",
    "sciama s original value for the electron density of the reynolds layer ( @xmath69 @xmath70 ) ,    truly lead to extreme flattening of the dark halo ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we would like to investigate the consequences of the relaxing of these assumptions . keeping the assumption ( 1 ) and",
    "relaxing ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) leads to results shown in the fig .  1 .",
    "for the electron density , we use the more realistic values of the eq .",
    "( [ nevalue ] ) .",
    "we see that the `` classical '' value of @xmath72 _ does not _ warrant an extreme degree of the neutrino halo flattening , contrary to the claim in the ref .",
    "instead , a moderate flattening @xmath73 seems to be quite acceptable .",
    "if we relax the assumption ( 1 ) , it is necessary to ask : which ionizing sources are viable for creating the electron density in ( [ nevalue ] ) ?",
    "there are several possibilities , main ones being :    * o and b stars of the galactic disk ; * metagalactic uv ionizing background ; * soft x - ray background , either of galactic or extragalactic origin ; * cosmic rays which penetrate the reynolds layer ; * large - scale ionizing shock waves .",
    "some of them we can eliminate almost immediately , since we are not interested in the detailed ionization structure , only in influence of a specific ionizing source .",
    "cosmic ray ionization , which has played such a prominent role in the first comprehensive ism model of field , goldsmith and habing in 1969 @xcite , is now considered to be of secondary importance : an average ionization per h atom is now considered to be @xmath74 s@xmath75 ( in contradistinction to earlier estimates of @xmath76 s@xmath75 ) .",
    "this makes cosmic rays unimportant for the total ionization and heating budget of ism , with important exception of the interiors of giant molecular clouds . if , as we have seen , the density of electrons is @xmath77 @xmath70 ( order of magnitude estimates )",
    ", the total density can not be much higher , certainly @xmath78 @xmath70 .",
    "this makes resulting value of @xmath52 in the eq .",
    "( [ sc6 ] ) quite unimportant in comparison with the ddm term , and resulting decrease in flattening is negligible .",
    "similar considerations apply to soft x - ray ionization , which was first proposed by silk and werner @xcite .",
    "the justification is that , like the cosmic rays , x - rays penetrate vast amount of matter before knocking out a photoelectron which is subsequently capable of ionizing and exciting hydrogen .",
    "interestingly enough , for this ionization mechanism , more electrons are released from he than from h , since helium has larger photoionization cross - section at energies @xmath79 ev , situation opposite from the one in case of ddm ionization . however , primary ionization rate for this process is estimated as about @xmath80 s@xmath75 in an unshielded region @xcite . thus",
    ", resulting value of @xmath52 is @xmath81 @xmath70 s@xmath75 , which does not significantly influence the required flattening of the neutrino halo .",
    "the same conclusion applies _ a fortiori _ when we consider effects of finite opacity of the reynolds layer .",
    "what is the most difficult is to estimate the importance of the most plausible source of ionization : o and b stars in the milky way disk @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty is reflected in the conclusions of mathis @xcite , and is connected with the ( in)famous problem of the opacity of disks of spiral galaxies @xcite , which has not been solved to this day .",
    "it seems clear that the _ shape _ of the ionizing spectrum created by galactic early - type stars is capable of explaining the ionization state of the reynolds layer , but more detailed modelling of the global ism opacity will be necessary to positively discern whether this process really takes place .",
    "our conclusion with respect to flattening seem , however , clear : if a fraction of o and b stars ionizing flux successfully penetrates dense low - latitude ism , resulting ionization would further obviate need for flattening of the hypothetical decaying neutrino halo .",
    "very recently , an attempt has been made to show that the diffuse ionization in the galaxy can be explained via the decaying of sterile neutrinos with a mass of 27.4 ev and lifetime of @xmath82 s @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos appear in the theory as a consequence of the recent super - kamiokande result according to which the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is mainly due to nearly maximal oscillations between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath84 is a sterile neutrino @xcite .",
    "this approach is conceived in order to overcome the perhaps biggest objection to the ddm theory , i.e.  the bulk of the dark matter is assumed to be in neutrinos .",
    "thus , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , one can state that matter contribution to the critical density of the universe is @xmath85 , while the baryonic contribution is @xmath86 , that leads to halo density of sterile neutrinos of @xmath87 @xmath25 that is 10 times less than the value previously assumed ( cf .",
    "[ [ nevalue ] ] ) . according to the eq .",
    "[ [ equila ] ] this would require that the radiative lifetime is significantly lowered for these sterile neutrinos , i.e. @xmath88 s. however , as we have shown , it is not necessary to consider such radical change of this fundamental parameter of the ddm theory ",
    "it is possible to obtain lower concentrations of neutrinos by taking into account the term @xmath52 , like in eq .",
    "[ [ equilb ] ] .",
    "it is clear , from the eq .",
    "( [ sc5 ] ) , that larger values for @xmath89 , require huge amount of flattening , which is quite unacceptable . for @xmath90 ,",
    "corresponding flattening parameter is @xmath91 .",
    "this much flattening will have several consequences contradictory to the observational data : it is extremely improbable that such number of microlensing events would have been observed ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it would violate the oort limit ( or its absence , see @xcite ) , causing either the excessive local halo density @xcite , or too small total galactic mass to be consistent with the satellite galaxies measurements @xcite ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "both addition of other ionizing sources and addition of other dynamically important halo components would only act to increase the discrepancy with the minimal tolerable amount of flattening .",
    "we could increase the resulting flattening parameter .",
    "however , any appeal of the original ddm ( as well as conforming to the occam s razor ) would be lost in this case , which would pile unwarranted hypotheses and require fine - tuning of its model parameters . ]",
    "thus , we consider this an indication of non - viability of the large @xmath89 hypothesis .",
    "we conclude that in view of all the uncertainties considered , as well as improved values for several of the observable quantities , flattening of the dark halo of the milky way can be regarded as neither well - defined nor essential prediction of the ddm theory ."
