    "the flickering ( stochastic light variations on timescales of a few minutes with amplitude of a few@xmath14 magnitudes ) is a variability observed in the three main types of binaries that contain white dwarfs accreting material from a companion mass - donor star : cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , supersoft x - ray binaries , and symbiotic stars ( sokoloski 2003 ) .",

    "we measure the minimum , maximum , and average brightness in the corresponding band , plus the standard deviation of the run .",
    "as can be seen in figs . [ fig1 - 1 ] , [ fig1 - 2 ] , [ fig1 - 3 ] and table  1 , during our observations rs  oph exhibited variability on a time scale of 1 - 30 minutes with amplitude 0.3 mag in @xmath18 .",

    "the significance in eq.1-eq.3 is always @xmath34 indicating that all these correlations are highly significant and changes in the colours of rs  oph are correlated with brightness variations .",
    "bruch ( 1992 ) proposed that the light curve of cvs can be separated into two parts  constant light and variable ( flickering ) source .",
    "we assume that all the variability is due to flickering .",
    "in these suppositions the flickering light source is considered 100% modulated .",
    "following these suggestions , we calculate the flux of the flickering light source as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the average flux during the run and @xmath37 is the minimum flux during the run ( corrected for the typical error of the observations ) .",
    "@xmath38 has been calculated for each band , using the values given in table 1 and bessel ( 1979 ) calibration for the fluxes of a zero magnitude star .",
    "adopting these results , we find that the flickering light source contributes about 6% of the light in the @xmath19 band , 7% in @xmath18 , 10% in @xmath20 , and 13% in @xmath17 .",
    "following snijders ( 1987 ) we assume interstellar extinction @xmath39 and an extinction law as given in cardelli et al.(1989 ) . using the colour relations ( eq.1eq.3 , derived in sect.3.1 ) in the interval @xmath40 mag ( in other words average @xmath41 and we calculate average values for other bands , minimal brightness in @xmath42 , and we derive minimal fluxes in other bands ) , we obtain colours of the flickering light source in rs  oph as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . on 2009",
    "july 21 we obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "using the entire runs in @xmath17 band from 2009 july 23 and @xmath20 and @xmath18 from 2009 july 21 ( as plotted in fig.[bb ] ) we calculate @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",
    "the values are similar to the colours of the flickering source in 1983 july - august @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( bruch 1992 ) .",
    "the derived @xmath51 colour corresponds to a b4v star ( @xmath52  k ) and a black body with @xmath53  k. the @xmath54 colour corresponds to an a5v ( @xmath55  k ) star and a black body with @xmath56  k. @xmath57 corresponds to a f8v star ( @xmath58  k ) .",
    "these estimates give an approximate temperature of the flickering light source @xmath59  k.    for the flickering light source we obtain magnitudes ( corrected for interstellar extinction ) :    2008 july 6 : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 mag ;    2009 july 21 : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 mag ;    2009 july 23 : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 mag .",

    "we adopt @xmath76 kpc as given in bode ( 1987 ) . in fig.[bb ] we plot these magnitudes transformed to fluxes . using a black body fit ( @xmath77 routine of iraf ) , we calculate for the flickering light source : @xmath78  k ; @xmath79  @xmath80 ; @xmath81  @xmath6 ( 2008 july 6 ) and @xmath82  k ; @xmath83  @xmath80 ; @xmath84 ( 2009 july 21 and 23 ) . in fig.[bb]c",
    "we plot all points normalized to the corresponding v band flux .",
    "the fit gives @xmath85  k ;    our @xmath21-band data from 2008 july 6 have considerably larger observational errors due to a technical problem which gave as a consequence a variable dark current pattern of the ccd .",
    "@xmath17 from 2009 july 21 and @xmath20 from 2009 july 23 are short .",
    "they are therefore not used in the black body fits nor plotted in fig.[bb ] .",
    "there are several different estimates of the mass accretion rate in rs  oph .",
    "an estimate of @xmath86  yr@xmath87 arises from the required mass accreted on to the wd to give rise to the outburst plus the latest inter - outburst time scale of 21 years ( osborne et al . 2010 ) . assuming",
    "@xmath88  @xmath80  ( starrfield et al . 1991 ) , this results in a total accretion luminosity @xmath89  @xmath6 .",
    "alternatively , walder et al .",

    "the spectral energy distribution of the accretion disk around the wd is similar to mid - b spectral type ( dobrzycka et al .",
    "1996 ) with luminosity @xmath93  @xmath6 . in practice",
    "therefore , the different estimates give @xmath94  @xmath6 , which means that 5%-35% of the total accretion luminosity is emitted by the flickering source ( in other words @xmath95 ) .",
    "we searched for time lags between the light curves in different bands , using the interpolation cross - correlation method ( gaskell & sparke , 1986 ) , but found no delays larger than 10 sec , which is shorter than our time resolution ( the exposure times ) .",

    "the data for the cvs and t  crb are from bruch ( 1992 ) .",
    "we also plot 2 points for mwc  560 and 2 for v407  cyg , which are calculated from the data of gromadzki et al .",
    "( 2006 )    the crosses represent rs  oph .",
    "the three crosses refer to the three epochs of observations  1983 , 2008 , 2009 .",
    "they lie well outside the area of the cvs . to address the possible errors of our measurement",
    ", we separated our light curves of rs  oph ( plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1 ] ) into two parts ( from ut  19:46 to ut  20:26 and ut  20:27",
    " 21:22 ) .",
    "we obtained for the flickering source @xmath96 @xmath97 for the first time interval , and @xmath98 @xmath99 for the second .",
    "this indicates that for rs  oph the errors are approximately equal to the size of the symbols .    to search for differences between the flickering of symbiotic stars and cvs we performed a two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test ( peacock 1983 ; fasano & franceschini 1987 ) , using the data plotted on fig.[2c ]",
    "we compare colours of the flickering of the recurrent novae rs  oph and t  crb with those of the cvs .",
    "the test gives a probability of @xmath100 that both distributions are extracted from the same parent population .",
    "we also performed the same test but comparing cvs with all symbiotic stars .",
    "the test gives a probability of @xmath101 that both distributions are extracted from the same parent population .",
    "the number of points is not high , but sufficient , as shown in fasano & franceschini ( 1987 ) , and the difference is significant .",
    "this result indicates that in this diagram there are clues to the cause of the differences between the flickering of these two classes of accreting white dwarfs .    in the symbiotics of course",
    ", the mass donor is a red giant and the orbital periods are @xmath102 d. in the cvs the mass donors are late - type dwarfs and the orbital periods are @xmath103 times shorter . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first evidence that flickering differs in these types of accreting wds and the physical cause of this difference warrants further investigation ( see below ) .",
    "in quiescence rs  oph varies irregulary between @xmath104 ( collazzi et al .",
    "2009 , aavso light curves ) . this variability is observed before as well as after the 2006 outburst .",
    "darnley et al.(2008 ) detected an increase of the brightness in @xmath20 from @xmath105 to @xmath106 mag and from @xmath107 to @xmath108 for a year after the 2006 outburst .",
    "worters et al .",
    "( 2007 ) detected an increase in @xmath18 from @xmath109 to @xmath110 for 2 weeks .",
    "the brightness of rs  oph at the time of our flickering observations is well inside these limits ( unfortunately , there does not seem to be any published @xmath17 light curve ) .",
    "the derived parameters of the flickering can be considered as typical for quiescence .",
    "after the 2006 outburst the flickering of rs  oph disappeared ( zamanov et al .",
    "2006 ) probably as a result of ( 1 ) destruction of the accretion disk from the nova explosion or ( 2 ) a change in the inner disk associated with jet production ( sokoloski et al .",
    "the flickering resumed by day 241 of the outburst ( worters et al .",
    "2007 ) . for the symbiotic star ch",
    "cyg , sokoloski & kenyon ( 2003 ) observed changes in the flickering in association with the mass ejection event .",
    "observations of ch  cyg and rs  oph therefore indicate that a connection does exist between the flickering behaviour and the ejection of matter from the wd .",
    "different sites for the origin of the flickering have been discussed .",
    "they are all related to the accretion process :    * ( i ) * the bright spot ( the region of impact of the stream of transferred matter from the mass donor star on the accretion disk ) ;    * ( ii ) * the boundary layer ( between the innermost accretion disk and the white dwarf surface ) ;    * ( iii ) * inside the accretion disk itself .",
    "+ the findings of bruch ( 2000 ) for ht cas , v2051 oph , ip peg and ux uma demonstrated that the flickering in these cvs can originate in both regions * ( i ) * and * ( ii)*.    * ( i ) * the temperature and the size of the bright spot are derived for a number of cvs .",
    "a few examples of temperatures are : for oy  car wood et al ( 1989 ) calculated black body @xmath111  k , and color temperature @xmath112  k ; marsh ( 1988 ) for ip  peg - @xmath113  k ; zhang & robinson ( 1987 ) for u  gem - @xmath114  k ; robinson et al .",
    "( 1978 ) give @xmath115  k for the bright spot in wz  sge .",
    "the temperature of the optical flickering source of rs oph @xmath116  k ( see sect.4.1 ) is similar to the temperature of the bright spot for the cvs .",
    "the mass transfer in rs oph may not be from roche lobe overflow ( as in cvs ) , but via stellar wind accretion . as a result of the supersonic motion of the wd through the red giant wind",
    "there should be a shock cone and an accretion wake . around the wd ,",
    "it is likely that an accretion disk and/or a cocoon is formed . in the place where the matter flowing through the accretion wake encounters the accretion disk / cocoon a bright spot could be formed ( analogous to the bright spot formed in the case of cvs , where the mass flow from the inner lagrangian point encounters the accretion disk ) .    *",
    "( ii ) * another possible site for the origin of the flickering in rs  oph is the boundary layer between the white dwarf and accretion disk .",
    "bruch & duschl ( 1993 ) estimated the size of the boundary layer ( @xmath117 ) in rs  oph as @xmath118 . in their model @xmath119",
    "is connected with the size of the boundary layer ( @xmath120 is the the luminosity of the accretion disk , @xmath121 is the luminosity of the boundary layer ; see fig  1 in bruch & duschl 1993 ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath122 @xmath6 , and @xmath123 @xmath6 , then we calculate @xmath124 , and the lower value agrees with the size of the boundary layer as estimated by bruch & duschl ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , @xmath125 of rs  oph as derived in sect .",
    "4.1 is too low for a boundary layer .    *",
    "( iii ) * for uu  aqr , baptista & bortoletto ( 2008 ) found no evidence of flickering generated in regions * ( i ) * and * ( ii)*. they suggested that the flickering in uu aqr is generated in the accretion disk itself and a possible reason can be turbulence generated after the collision of disk gas with the density - enhanced spiral wave in the accretion disk .    the radial temperature profile of a steady - state accretion disk is : @xmath126 , \\ ] ] where @xmath127 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath19 is the radial distance from the wd . using the parameters for rs  oph , a temperature @xmath1289500 k ( the temperature of the flickering light source as derived in sect . [ tfl ] ) should be achieved at a distance @xmath129 @xmath80  from the wd .",
    "if * ( iii ) * is the place for the origin of the flickering of rs  oph , then it comes from @xmath19  .5ex  1  @xmath80  from the wd .    to understand more fully the nature of the flickering variability of rs  oph we need to acquire a set of spectra simultaneously with photometry and with time resolution @xmath130 seconds ( see also sokoloski 2003 ) .",
    "such spectra potentially can directly give the spectrum of the flickering light source .",
    "we report our ccd observations of the flickering variability of the recurrent nova rs oph , simultaneously with 4 telescopes in the @xmath16 bands .",
    "rs  oph has a flickering source with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 .    for the flickering light source in rs  oph ( 1 ) we estimate @xmath131  k , which is similar to the temperature of the bright spot in cvs ; ( 2 ) using a distance of @xmath7  kpc , we find size @xmath132  @xmath80 , and luminosity @xmath133 .",
