    "lattice distortion induced by a magnetic ordering is a central mechanism of the magnetoelectric coupling observed in magnetic insulators  @xcite .",
    "magnetic ions may shift positions at the magnetic ordering to increase their exchange interaction energy . as a result",
    ", a structural distortion develops in the lattice  @xcite . in perovskite",
    "manganite , tbmno@xmath5 , for instance , a sinusoidal antiferromagnetic ordering induces a lattice modulation manifested by superlattice bragg reflections below @xmath4 . with further decreasing temperature , a spontaneous polarization associated with the lattice modulation",
    "is observed  @xcite .",
    "thus , a close examination of the lattice distortion provides a key information for the understanding of the magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "typically , the induced structural distortion by the magnetic ordering is much weaker than those observed in normal ferroelectrics i.e. the spontaneous polarization of tbmno@xmath5 is only about a few percent of batio@xmath5 .",
    "the estimation of the atomic displacement below @xmath4 was made on single crystal tbmno@xmath5 by exafs measurements , providing the upper limit of @xmath6 5@xmath710@xmath8    @xcite .",
    "besides , the induced lattice distortion often lacks long - range ordering .",
    "for example , a multiferroic pb(fe@xmath9nb@xmath9)o@xmath5 shows a jump in dielectric response at the antiferromagnetic transition without long - range structural transition  @xcite .",
    "a subsequent local structural studies reported an evidence of the structural disorder induced by the off - centering of pb ion  @xcite below the n@xmath3el temperature .",
    "in this paper , we present a structural evolution of magnetoelectric bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bfo ) from neutron powder diffraction measurements at temperatures 300  k , 250  k , 200  k , above and below the n@xmath3el temperature ( @xmath4=240  k ) .",
    "bfo is known for a strong dielectric anomaly near room temperature ( @xmath6 240  k ) induced by the antiferromagnetic ordering  @xcite and serves as a prototype system to study the magnetoelectric coupling . in bfo , however , no long - range structural transition has been reported below the n@xmath3el temperature and the nature of the lattice distortion is still not well understood . to address the structural evolution of bfo both local structures and long - range symmetry",
    "are analyzed using the atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) method  @xcite and the rietveld refinement  @xcite .",
    "fe@xmath1o@xmath2 at 300  k , 250  k , and 200  k , respectively .",
    "the solid lines are the corresponding rietveld fittings using space group @xmath10 .",
    "the tick marks indicate bragg peak positions at 300  k. difference curves are also shown .",
    "the inset shows dielectric parameter , @xmath11 of a single crystal bfo along the b - axis , redrawn using data from ref .",
    "ceramic sample of bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 was synthesized using a conventional solid state reaction . for neutron diffraction experiments ceramic sample",
    "was crushed into fine powders and then annealed to relieve strain .",
    "neutron powder diffraction experiments were performed on the npdf instrument at the los alamos neutron science center .",
    "powder samples were loaded in a vanadium can and then mounted in a closed - cycle helium cryostat with helium exchange gas .",
    "figure 1 shows neutron powder diffraction patterns of bfo at 300  k , 250  k , and 200  k , respectively . in the inset , a dielectric parameter of a single crystal bfo along the b - axis taken from ref .",
    "@xcite is shown .",
    "cusplike anomaly at @xmath4 indicates that a structural distortion develops at the magnetic ordering .",
    "rietveld refinements were performed using the orthorhombic space group @xmath10  @xcite for the powder diffraction patterns above and below the n@xmath3el temperature .",
    "details of structural parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "the excellent matching between the data ( open circles ) and fittings ( solid lines ) suggests that the long - range crystal structure of bfo remains orthorhombic across @xmath4 .",
    "also , we note that all the structural parameters such as the lattice parameters , atomic positions , and thermal parameters behave normally with decreasing temperature .",
    "in particular , positions of the magnetic ion at the octahedral site ( fe i ) and tetrahedral site ( fe ii ) exhibit little variation with the temperature change .",
    "thus , we may conclude that if a structural variation appears at @xmath4 it must be a local distortion rather than long - range ordered .",
    ".structural parameters of bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 at temperatures 300  k , 250  k , and 200  k obtained from rietveld refinements . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     next , we examine spin configuration of fe ions on @xmath12 plane  @xcite which provides insight in understanding how local distortion develops at the antiferromagnetic ordering . the symbol @xmath13 denotes a ferromagnetically coupled octahedral fe atoms along the @xmath14 axis and @xmath15 indicates a tetrahedral fe atom .",
    "the thick , thin , and dotted lines represent the relative strength of antiferromagnetic coupling , respectively .",
    "the spin frustrations at the corner tetrahedra are obvious as a result of the competing exchange interactions among spins on octahedral and tetrahedral sites  @xcite .",
    "overall , the direct - neighbor fe - fe pairs have relatively short pair distances and antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "but the indirect - neighbor f@xmath16-f@xmath16 pairs involve the intervening polyhedron and their spins are not coupled due to a spin frustration on one of the pair . with these differences in geometrical arrangement and the spin configuration between the direct - neighbor and the indirect - neighbor fe - fe pairs",
    ", it is expected that the corresponding pdf peaks of these pairs exhibit a distinct temperature dependence from each other .",
    "indeed , we show in fig  3(b ) that the pdf peaks of the direct - neighbor fe - fe pairs do not show temperature dependence . on the contrary , the atomic pairs involving a spin frustrated fe atom exhibit a temperature evolution .",
    "note in fig .",
    "4(c ) that pdf peaks at @xmath17  4.00  and @xmath6 4.25   due to the f@xmath16-o and f@xmath16-f@xmath16 pairs show a noticeable change below @xmath4 .",
    "by using neutron pdf analysis we present an evidence for the local structural distortion in bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 below @xmath4 which may shed light on the intriguing dielectric anomaly at the onset of the antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "we show that fe ions do not displace from their octahedral and tetrahedral sites , and oxygen polyhedra remain undistorted across @xmath4 . instead , we find that the local structural distortion is due to a temperature evolution of atomic pairs involving a spin frustrated fe atom . based on these results we propose that the dielectric anomaly of bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 is not due to the off - centering of fe ions but by a local symmetry breaking related to a local tilting of a tetrahedron at the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering .",
