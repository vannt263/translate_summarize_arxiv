    "modern technicolor ( tc ) models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking require assistance for top - color interactions that are strong in the tev energy region to provide the large mass of the top quark , and a walking technicolor ( wtc ) gauge coupling to aid in the avoidance of large flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) effects .",
    "the first addition consists of a class of topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) models made through the careful arrangement of tc , topcolor , extended hypercharge groups , and relevant techniquark and standard model ( sm ) fermion representations . with the help of extended technicolor ( etc )",
    ", we expect that technicolor condensates will form and provide the mass for the weak vector bosons .",
    "etc provides the mass for the light quarks and leptons and a bottom - quark - sized mass to the top .",
    "the largest contribution to the top - quark mass is from the formation of a top - quark condensate through the dynamics of the topcolor gauge sector .",
    "the second addition is based on the phase diagram of strongly coupled tc gauge theories involving fermions in arbitrary representations of the gauge group . with suitable choices for the tc group and techniquark representations",
    ", wtc is a natural option for situations with asymptotic freedom that are nearly conformal . in this case",
    ", the tc gauge coupling has an approximate infrared - stable fixed point ( the zero of the beta function ) @xmath3 which is slightly larger than the critical value @xmath4 necessary for techniquark condensate formation .",
    "in such a theory , for values of @xmath5 above @xmath3 , as the energy scale decreases @xmath5 increases . however , its rate of increase decreases to zero as @xmath5 approaches @xmath3 .",
    "hence , over an extended energy interval , @xmath5 is order o(1 ) , and it is slowly varying which leads a large anomalous dimension @xmath6 for the bilinear local techniquark operator .",
    "this results in the enhancement of the sm fermion and those undiscovered pseudo goldstone boson masses , which achieve realistic scales while maintaining sufficient suppression of fcnc effects .",
    "the typical gauge group of the tc2 models is @xmath7 in which the topcolor and extended hypercharge groups @xmath8 spontaneously break into their diagonal subgroups @xmath9 at an energy of a few tev .",
    "the remaining electroweak groups @xmath10 spontaneously break into their electromagnetic subgroup @xmath11 at electroweak scale because of a combination of a top - quark condensate and techniquark condensate . in the simplest example of hill s tc2 model @xcite",
    ", there are separate color and weak hypercharge gauge groups for the heavy third generation quarks and leptons and for the two lighter generations .",
    "the third generation transforms under a strongly coupled @xmath12 and maintains its usual charges .",
    "however , the light generations transform conventionally under a weakly coupled @xmath13 . near 1 tev ,",
    "these four groups break into a diagonal subgroup of ordinary color and hypercharge , @xmath9 .",
    "the desired condensation pattern occurs because the @xmath14 couplings are such that the spontaneously broken @xmath12 interactions are supercritical only for the top quark .",
    "after hill s proposal was made , chivukula , dobrescu , and terning @xcite claimed that the techniquarks required to break the top and bottom quark chiral symmetries are likely to have custodial - isospin violating couplings to the strong @xmath14 . to maintain a @xmath15",
    ", the @xmath14 interaction must be so weak that it is necessary to fine - tune the @xmath16 coupling .",
    "this results in the implementation of the theory being unnatural . to remedy this isospin violation and improve the suitability of the model , k. lane proposed a natural prototype tc2 model in ref.@xcite . in that model , the different techniquark isodoublets , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,",
    "provide etc mass to the top and bottom quarks .",
    "these doublets then could have different @xmath14 charges , which are isospin conserving for the right and left handed parts of each doublet .",
    "the @xmath19 symmetries presented in the model automatically avoid the problem of @xmath20 mixing raised by kominis@xcite . to achieve the mixing of the magnitude observed between the heavy and light generations while breaking the strong top - color interactions near 1 tev , k. lane also proposed an alternative model based on the nontrivial patterns of techniquark condensation and discussed its phenomenology@xcite . in this new model , to break the extended hypercharge groups into @xmath21 , a set of electrically neutral @xmath22 singlet techniquarks belonging to the antisymmetric tensor representation of the tc group were added into the model .",
    "this , in combination with other techniquarks , further ensures the technicolor coupling walks . with so many techniquarks",
    ", one may wonder whether the @xmath23 parameter of the model can be small .",
    "although qualitatively the large number of techniquarks will increase the value of @xmath23 , walking effects and certain arrangements of the hypercharges of the techniquarks may compensate for this increase , and result in a small overall @xmath23 parameter .",
    "one aim of this paper is to examine this possibility .",
    "in fact , our interests are not limited to the s parameter , which is one of the low energy constants ( lecs ) of the bosonic part of the standard electroweak chiral lagrangian ( ewcl)@xcite .",
    "rather , our interests include all ewcl lecs . in our previous studies",
    ", we compiled a formulation for computing the bosonic part of the ewcl lecs for orders up to @xmath1 for the one - doublet tc model discussed in ref.@xcite , hill s schematic tc2 model @xcite in ref.@xcite , k. lane s natural prototype tc2 model @xcite in ref.@xcite and a hypercharge - universal tc2 model @xcite in ref.@xcite . here",
    ", the bosonic part of the ewcl is the part that only involves sm electroweak gauge fields and corresponding goldstone fields .",
    "this part describes the electroweak symmetry breaking effects on the electroweak gauge fields , but the parts of the ewcl dealing with matter also include sm fermions which describe the electroweak symmetry breaking effects on the sm fermion fields . in the literature ,",
    "these two parts are proposed in refs.@xcite and @xcite separately because they have independent characteristics .",
    "the reason that we choose to compute the bosonic part of the ewcl in isolation is that the matter part is more complex than the bosonic part .",
    "moreover , some of the three - dimensional fermion mass terms and six - dimensional fcnc terms were already discussed in lane s original paper @xcite . in this paper , we only discuss the bosonic part of the ewcl for the first stage of computing the lecs that are generalized from the @xmath23 parameter , and leave the part dealing with matter for future discussion .",
    "the ewcl is an universal platform which enables us to compare different underlying models with experimental data and extract the true physical theory that guides our world . to achieve this comparison ,",
    "we compute the ewcl coefficients model by model .",
    "this study is the fourth paper in a series , starting with ref.@xcite , in which we compute these strongly coupled physics models . here",
    ", we focus on k. lane s alternative tc2 model with nontrivial tc fermion condensation and walking@xcite , which was mentioned previously .",
    "corresponding to recent advances in the understanding of the phase diagram of the @xmath24 gauge theories and the new possibilities for model building@xcite , this work offers a modern way to investigate walking effects in a realistic strongly - coupled theory with complex structures .    in this paper , except for some conventional calculations that are similar to those in our previous papers , we focus on the effects of walking that have not been discussed before .",
    "we will compare the different situations of walking , ideal walking , and running ; and examine their effects on the @xmath23 parameter . in the next section ,",
    "we first review k. lane s alternative tc2 model with nontrivial condensation and walking@xcite and discuss its phase structure . in section iii , we apply our formulation developed in ref.@xcite to lane s model @xcite .",
    "we perform these dynamical calculations through several steps : first we integrate in the goldstone field , u. then , we integrate out the technigluons and techniquarks by solving the schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) for techniquarks .",
    "next , we integrate out the colorons and @xmath0 , perform a low energy expansion , and compute the effective action .",
    "finally , we obtain the ewcl coefficients . for simplicity ,",
    "some details of the derivation and computation in this section are placed in the appendices .",
    "section iv .",
    "contains numerical results and discussions .",
    "section v. is a short summary and discussion .",
    "consider k. lane s tc2 model @xcite with nontrivial tc fermion condensation and walking , in which the group is given by ( [ gaugegroup ] ) .",
    "because we are only interested in the bosonic part of ewcl , which is independent of the sm fermions , we do not list their representations and @xmath19 charge arrangements here .",
    "the left gauge charges for the techniquarks are shown in table i. there are three sets of techniquarks .",
    "the first set includes @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these are the specific techniquarks of the model and are expected to have twisted condensates that generate @xmath27 and electroweak breaking , and a sufficient level of generation mixing .",
    "the second set includes @xmath28 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are the standard tc2 techniquarks from lane s first natural prototype tc2 model @xcite .",
    "they supply the etc mass to the sm fermions , including the top and bottom .",
    "the third set consists of the high - dimensional representation field @xmath29 , which is responsible for generating @xmath30 and ensuring theory walking .

    "the numbers on each curve are the masses of the @xmath0 boson in tev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , we estimate the magnitude of the walking effect in the present model .",
    "because the primary contribution to the walking effect is from the running coupling constant , which appears in the kernel of the sde , we can measure the walking effect by comparing two other running behaviors :    * running @xmath5 :  rather than using a two - loop running coupling constant ( [ alphabehavior ] ) which exhibits an approximation of walking behavior in @xmath36 and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , we used the one - loop running coupling constant used in our previous work@xcite as @xmath37 eq.([alphar ] ) was originally introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the general principle of the technique is to use a plateau in the low energy region to normalize the possibly infinite value in the infrared region that is predicted using the perturbative result and smoothly connect this infrared plateau with the ultraviolet asymptotic freedom running behavior .",
    "note that if we ignore the two - loop term in the @xmath38 function in this model and normalize the infrared coupling constant such that it has a finite value , we can qualitatively obtain the above form of the running coupling constant .",
    "furthermore , this approximation at the one - loop level suggests that @xmath39 must be treated as @xmath40 in this running situation .",
    "the change from one - loop running to two - loop walking reflects the evolution of our understanding of the gauge - coupling running behavior in non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "in addition , the decision to use the latter model in this study is important because it confirms the existence of the infrared fixed point@xcite which qualitatively supports the modern two - loop - based explanation of walking .",
    "* ideal walking @xmath5 :  rather than using a two - loop running coupling constant ( [ alphabehavior ] ) and a value of @xmath41 that is not close in value to the critical coupling @xmath42 for the first and second set of techniquarks , we use the same running coupling constant but change the value of @xmath3 in ( [ alphabehavior ] ) by artificially requiring that @xmath43 .",
    "although this is not a realistic case for the model , it is closer to the conformal situation , and therefore , ideal walking .    the reason we must consider the above cases is because our analytical estimation using the @xmath38 may cause some error .",
    "therefore , we can use these two extremes to investigate the effect of changes in the situation on our results .",
    "we show three different behaviors of @xmath5 in fig.[alphaall ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath44 is much bigger than @xmath45 only in the extreme infrared region , and that the running behavior corresponding to @xmath46 is smaller than that corresponding to @xmath45 over most of the energy region . from a comparison of fig.[alphaall ] with fig.[fig - alpha ] , it can be seen that the running effect increases the height of the infrared plateau and narrows its length .",
    "to contrast other differences resulting from these different couplings , in fig.[sigma ] , we show the techniquark self - energies , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which are determined by the sdes ( [ sdetildesigma ] ) and ( [ sdehatsigma ] ) .",
    "we found that the closer the system came to walking , the lower and wider the techniquark self - energy plateau was .",
    "by contrast , during running , the plateau was higher and narrower .",
    "for fixed @xmath49gev , we found that the running situation produces a value of @xmath50tev ( @xmath51 in the running case can not be determined solely by the running behavior and requires some other physical parameters to be known ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the estimate of @xmath52 given in ref.@xcite .",
    "our walking and ideal walking situations yield : @xmath53 from this , it can be seen that @xmath39 is very sensitive to the walking effect .",
    "the closer the system is to ideal walking , the bigger the value of @xmath39 .",
    "this was further checked by calculating @xmath39 for several values of @xmath54 .",
    "these points were then plotted as a curve in fig.[lambdaw ] to quantitatively show the sensitivity of @xmath39 to the degree of walking .",
    "( tev ) on the degree of walking . ]",
    "the small value of @xmath39 in our walking situation suggests that the walking effect in the present model is not large enough . in an ideal walking situation",
    ", @xmath39 is large and can be treated as @xmath51 .",
    "is the coupling used in our calculation .",
    "@xmath44 is the running coupling , which is given in ( [ alphar ] ) . here , we show @xmath55 to facilitate comparison between the couplings .",
    "@xmath46 is the ideal walking coupling , where @xmath56 . ]     and @xmath57 the self - energies for the second and third sets of techniquarks for the coupling that we used in our calculation . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the self - energies for the second and third sets of techniquarks for the running coupling , which is given in ( [ alphar ] ) . here , we show @xmath60 and @xmath61 to facilitate comparison between the self - energies . @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the self - energies for the second and third sets of techniquarks for the ideal walking coupling , where @xmath56 . ]    to show the effect of walking on the @xmath23 parameter , in fig.[sr ] , we show the value of @xmath23 for couplings corresponding to running and ideal walking . it can be seen that for ideal walking ( the upper bound on @xmath64 is reduced to 0.012 in this case ) , @xmath23 is only slightly smaller than 2 .",
    "therefore , our prediction that @xmath23 is about 2 is not significantly altered , even as one approaches the walking region .",
    "however , fig.[sr ] shows that for running , @xmath23 is doubled by reaching a value of 4 .",
    "this implies that because of the existence of the infrared fixed point , the walking only reduces the @xmath23 parameter by a factor of 2 .",
    "furthermore , comparing the values of the @xmath23 parameters at different couplings with their perturbative values @xmath65 , we found that the perturbative value of @xmath23 lies just between our realistic value and that of the running case .",
    "parameters for the running and walking cases . ]    for the effect of walking on the other ewcl lecs , our numerical calculation shows that for @xmath66 walking reduces these lecs to roughly @xmath67 of their original values in the running case .",
    "@xmath68 , similar to the @xmath23 parameter , is reduced by the walking effect to half of its original value in the running case .",
    "@xmath69 are reduced by one order of magnitude by the walking effect , but their signs are preserved .",
    "@xmath35 is reduced by two orders of magnitude and changes in sign . using the expression for @xmath35 given by ( [ alpharesult ] )",
    ", the numerical computation shows that some cancellations occur here .",
    "it is these cancellations that result in @xmath35being the smallest among the ewcl lecs .",
    "because of this cancellation , if the techniquark self - energy is changed , more sign changes may occur .",
    "this cancellation may reduce the reliability of our estimate of @xmath35 and @xmath35 may be seen as one of the limitations of the calculation for the approximations used .",
    "we found that not all lecs are sensitive to how close to ideal walking the theory is .",
    "the only major exception is @xmath35 .",
    "finally , we found that walking has almost no effect on the coloron mass .",
    "we interpret this to mean that the techniquark self - energy will change the value of the coloron mass significantly , but walking , which changes the form of the techniquark self - energy , does not have a large effect on the coloron mass .",
    "in fact , some quantities , such as @xmath39 are sensitive to this detailed form of the techniquark self - energy , but some other quantities , such as the coloron mass , are not .",
    "in this paper , we discuss k. lane s tc2 model in the presence of nontrivial tc fermion condensation and walking .",
    "we focus on the walking effects in the model , which has not been discussed before .",
    "we also discuss the phase structure of the model in terms of the two - loop @xmath38 function of the tc coupling of the model .",
    "we found that to have both an infrared fixed point and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , the minimum @xmath70 for the tc group @xmath24 is @xmath36 .",
    "this is the optimal choice because it is the value that is the most conformal that can be used in our model .",
    "although this choice differs from the critical values , @xmath71 for the first and second sets of techniquarks and @xmath72 for the third set of techniquarks ( fig.[fig - phase ] ) , walking effects occur in the computed ewcl lecs",
    ". we can understand this explicit walking effect qualitatively through the relation , @xmath73 for @xmath74 . for @xmath36 , using the technique used in our previous studies@xcite , we derive the ewcl from lane s model and calculate the ewcl lecs up to an order of @xmath1 .",
    "we found that the primary contributions to the @xmath1 order coefficients arise from the three sets of techniquarks and @xmath0 .",
    "there is no limit on the upper bound of the @xmath0 mass which differs from the tc2 models@xcite that we discussed previously .",
    "moreover , all corrections from the @xmath0 particle are at least proportional to @xmath75 and vanish for a mixing of @xmath76 .",
    "it is especially important that the scale parameter , @xmath39 , appears in the solution of the two - loop @xmath38 .",
    "this signifies that the scale of walking can not be assumed to be @xmath51 in this model because , generally , @xmath77 .",
    "we found that @xmath78tev .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is small because it is sensitive to the walking effect .",
    "however , our choice of @xmath70 differs from its critical value , and does not exhibit a sufficient walking effect .",
    "we verified that in a more ideal walking case , @xmath39 can be increased by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "the ratio @xmath79 can be used as a measurement of the deviation of our theory from ideal walking .",
    "we also found that the coloron mass is roughly half of its expected value of 1 tev and is independent of the walking effect .",
    "the small coloron mass occurs as the result of including a correction from the coloron kinetic term for which the main contribution is from the techniquark self - energy .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath80 parameters are positive , and there is an upper bound for the @xmath64 parameter . for our choice of typical hyper - charges ,",
    "the upper bound of the @xmath64 parameter is 0.035 , which is well below the experimentally measured bound from pdg .",
    "the @xmath23 parameter is about 2 for our choice of typical hyper - charges , which already exceeds the experimentally verified constraint that it be half of the value from the running case , but similar to that of the ideal walking case . to reduce the value of the @xmath23 parameter",
    ", one can change hyper - charges .",
    "this can result in @xmath23 being negative for slightly larger values of @xmath64 .",
    "this allows for a case in which both @xmath23 and @xmath64 are within the bound from pdg .",
    "the leftmost nine nonzero lecs , @xmath81 are on the order of @xmath82 which matches the estimate obtained from naive dimensional analysis .",
    "@xmath69 are on the order of @xmath83 and @xmath35 is on order of @xmath84 .",
    "this is because @xmath69,and especially @xmath35 , are sensitive to walking effects . comparing these results with the constraints imposed by the precision data@xcite , we find that the results are consistent with the constraints from the precision data .",
    "however , @xmath85 has the correct order of magnitude , but the wrong sign .",
    "previously , we investigated bosonic contribution to the ewcl lecs for most of the tc2 models . in the future , we will focus on calculating the ewcl lecs in four areas : the first will be to explore new physics models , including the non - tc2-type models .",
    "the second will be to investigate the part of the ewcl dealing with matter .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the top quark .",
    "the third will be to deepen our understanding of the structure of the model we are currently discussing in areas such as phase diagrams and the infrared behavior of the gauge coupling constant .",
    "the fourth will be to improve the precision of the computation and reduce the number of approximations necessary . with an increasing number of models in our ewcl platform",
