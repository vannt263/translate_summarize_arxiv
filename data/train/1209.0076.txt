    "multi - electron losses ( el ) of projectile positive and negative ions colliding with neutral atoms and molecules play a key role in many problems of plasma physics and physics of accelerators , especially at low and intermediate collision energies",
    ". a contribution of multi - electron processes to the total electron - loss cross sections can be substantial and reach up to more than 50  % even for highly charged projectile ions .",
    "the total and @xmath0-fold el cross sections can be calculated in the classical approximation using the classical trajectory monte carlo approach  @xcite or the energy - deposition model  @xcite in the impact parameter representation providing an overall agreement with experimental data within a factor of two .    in the present work the deposit code described in ref .",
    "@xcite is used to calculate the total and @xmath0-fold el cross sections for @xmath1 ions , ( @xmath10 colliding with @xmath3 and @xmath4 targets at energies @xmath5 and @xmath6  mev / u .",
    "the results are in a good agreement with available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the deposit code is based on the semi - classical energy deposition model introduced by n.  bohr  @xcite and developed further in ref .",
    "@xcite for ionization of _ atoms _ by ions . here",
    ", this model is used for ionization of _ ions _ by neutral atoms at energies about a few mev / u , where a contribution of multiple - electron loss processes to the total loss cross - section is very large    in the energy deposition model , the problem of determination the @xmath0-fold ionization probabilities @xmath11 is reduced to calculation of a 3d integral over the ion - coordinate space using projectile electron density @xmath12 and the energy gain @xmath13 obtained in the field @xmath14 of the target atom @xmath15 here , index @xmath16 labels @xmath17-shell of the ion , where @xmath18 is the principal quantum number and @xmath19 is the orbital quantum number .",
    "the summation is over all occupied shells of the projectile ion .",
    "the energy gain @xmath20 is determined depending on the relation between the ion velocity @xmath21 and orbital velocity @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the binding energy of the projectile @xmath16-shell .",
    "electron density @xmath12 in the present work is calculated using nodeless slater wave functions , and atomic field at a distance @xmath24 from its nucleus is given by sum of three yukawa potentials with five fitting parameters defined from the dirack - hartree - fock - slater calculations  @xcite .",
    "the total el cross - section is obtained directly from the equation @xmath25 where parameter @xmath26 is ( numerically ) found from the equation @xmath27 using the first ionization potential @xmath28 of the projectile ion and expression  ( [ tb3dintegral ] ) for the energy @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0-fold cross - section is calculated in the following way @xmath29 where the @xmath0-fold ionization probabilities @xmath11 are taken from the statistical russek - meli model  @xcite . in this model",
    "the @xmath8 probabilities are presented analyticaly and can be found by using of the deposited energy @xmath7 and the ionization potentials  @xmath30 of the projectile .",
    "the calculated deposited energies @xmath7 and ionization probabilities @xmath11 are presented for @xmath31 ions colliding with @xmath4 target at the energy @xmath32  mev / u in fig .",

    "ionization probabilities calculated for @xmath37 system colliding at the energy @xmath32  mev / u are presented in fig  [ fig2pm ] .",
    "the figure shows that for a given collision energy the probability of the @xmath38-fold and more ionization processes is too small .",
    "this result is in correspondence with the experimental data  @xcite available only for number of ejected electrons @xmath39 . in the fig  [ fig3uqar ] and fig  [ fig4u28xe ] the calculated @xmath0-fold el cross sections are shown in comparison with experiment . as one can see , the difference between the two data sets ( experimental and theoretical ) is small .",
    "the figures show that multi - electron losses contribute to the total el loss significantly .    finally , we present calculated total el cross sections for all the considered systems . for @xmath37 at @xmath32  mev / u @xmath40  @xmath41 ( experimental value @xmath42",
    "@xmath41 ) , for @xmath43 at @xmath32  mev / u @xmath44  @xmath41 ( @xmath45  @xmath41 ) , and for @xmath46 at @xmath5  mev / u @xmath47  @xmath41 ( @xmath48  @xmath41 ) .",
    "the corresponding experimental data are taken from the refs .",
    "@xcite , and are in a reasonable agreement with results of our calculations .",
    "as seen from the experimental data for @xmath0-fold el cross sections , a contribution of muti - electron losses ( @xmath49 ) to the total el cross sections is very large and in the cases considered here reaches about 65  % .",
    "calculations performed by the deposit code well reproduce this result .",
    "it means that multi - electron loss processes should be taken into account in investigations of kinetic of highly charged ions , first of all , in determination of the ion - charge fractions , mean charges of ions passing through the solid , gaseous or plasma targets , in estimations of the vacuum conditions in accelerator machines and many others .",
