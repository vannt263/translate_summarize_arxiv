    "the magnetic behaviour of the hubbard model in the @xmath1 limit is an old problem . for this case",
    "a well - known exact theorem is due to nagaoka ( 1966 ) and thouless ( 1965 ) .",
    "it provides explicit , but highly idealized conditions under which ferromagnetism is stable in the hubbard model .",
    "it proves that for infinitely large repulsive hubbard @xmath2 the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state at half filling ( when the number of electrons @xmath3 is exactly equal with the number of lattice sites , hereafter denoted by @xmath4 ) is lifted by a single hole , i.e. , when @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the saturated ferromagnetic ground state is stable for any value of the hopping amplitude @xmath6 on square , simple cubic and bcc lattices , and for @xmath7 on triangle , fcc and hcp lattices .",
    "a very elegant and fully general proof was given for this result by tasaki ( 1989 ) based on the perron ",
    "frobenius theorem . for the nagaoka mechanism to work",
    ", the lattice needs to contain loops along which the hole can move .",
    "once the hole moves , the maximal overlap between the initial and the final state clearly occurs in a ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "the problems are that nagaoka s proof does not even extend to two holes , that a single hole is thermodynamically irrelevant , and that the limit of @xmath8 is highly unrealistic .",
    "moreover , several theoretical results state the instability of nagaoka s ferromagnetism for two holes , see e.g. doucot and wen ( 1989 ) , st ( 1991 a ) , tth ( 1991 ) .    in a recent published paper ( gurin and gulcsi , 2000 ) a formalism",
    "was presented which helps to deduce the partition function and some physical quantities of the system based on a loop summation ( i.e. path integral on lattice ) technique .",
    "the presented formulas have the advantage that the trace over the spin degrees of freedom has been taken exactly into account . resembling technique was used by st ( 1991 b ) to analyze the magnetic behaviour of the system in thermodynamic limit . however , his result is valid in thermodynamic limit , only in the case @xmath9 where @xmath10 and not for finite hole concentration and @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the behaviour of a small system with finite hole concentration , using monte carlo method at @xmath12 .",
    "starting from the aim to enhance the study of magnetic properties in the presence of a small hole concentration even at finite nonzero temperatures , the procedure is described in detail .",
    "the studied system is a @xmath0 lattice with periodic boundary conditions containing two holes .",
    "the results show an increase of the magnetisation with the decrease of the temperature .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "we describe the representation of the hilbert space in which the calculation is done , sec.iii .",
    "presents the partition function and the analyzed physical quantities , and sec .",
    "iv . contains the monte carlo results obtained , together with a discussion of the deduced results .",
    "our hamiltonian describes the one - band hubbard model in @xmath1 limit : @xmath13 where @xmath14 are hopping matrix elements for nearest neighbour sites ( otherwise @xmath15 ) .",
    "the operators @xmath16 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath17 at lattice site @xmath18 , and @xmath19 represents the particle number operator .",
    "the double occupancy is projected out by @xmath20 .    in our study",
    "we need operations with permutations therefore we fix below some notations concerning them .",
    "we treat a permutation @xmath21 of degree @xmath22 as a bijective function of the set of the first @xmath22 natural numbers into themselves .",
    "the product of the permutations is the standard function composition : @xmath23 .",
    "the symmetric group of degree @xmath22 formed by all the permutations of degree @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "the complex hilbert space generated by the elements of @xmath24 as an abstract orthonormalized basis endowed by the product defined by the convolution is called the group algebra of the symmetric group .",
    "the parity of a permutation is @xmath25 .",
    "we study the one band @xmath1 hubbard model .",
    "in such a tight - bindind description the electrons can live only on lattice sites in two orthogonal states with spin up and down .",
    "due to the kinetic energy term , an electron hops from one site to an other ( while its spin state remains unchanged ) , changing however the locations of the empty and occupied sites .",
    "hereafter , fixed positions of the occupied sites we call charge configuration which does not give account of the electronic spin states , only their places . iterating the effect of the hopping term on a state several times , hopping around the lattice , the electrons produce different charge configurations , particulary they can produce the original configuration again as well .",
    "however , the spin up and spin down electrons are commingled , therefore the spin configuration can be different than in the original state . in our descriptiom a spin configuration is given by the position of sites occupied by spin up and separately spin down electrons , respectively . in this way , fixing the charge configuration and the third component of the total spin @xmath26 , the spin configuration can be described by an ordered set of the up and down spin states : @xmath27 in which @xmath28 indicates the spin state of the electron situated in the @xmath18_-th occupied _ lattice site .",
    "certainly , at first , the occupied sites have to be labelled from 1 to @xmath3 . in this way",
    ", every spin configuration can be obtained by a permutation from @xmath29 , where @xmath30 if @xmath31 and @xmath32 if @xmath33 .",
    "based on the above mentioned observations , the hilbert space of the system and a basis of it can be expressed in terms of permutations .",
    "the charge configuration can be described by a function @xmath34 for which @xmath35 are the occupied lattice sites ( taken into account an arbitrary but fixed numbering of sites ) , and @xmath36 are the positions of holes .",
    "actually @xmath37 , but hereafter we denote the charge configuration by @xmath38 for which we require that @xmath39 have to be increasingly ordered .",
    "moreover , we do not distingwish permutations which differ only in the order of the positions of the holes @xmath40 , everyone is denoted by @xmath38 , and the further definitions and expressions do not depend on this undetermination .",
    "the hilbert space generated by all the different charge configurations as an orthonormalized basis is denoted by @xmath41 .    to label the occupied sites from 1 to @xmath3 we use the function @xmath42 .",
    "after it , a spin configuration @xmath27 can be described by a permutation @xmath43 which rearrange the basic order in @xmath44 in such a way that @xmath45 .",
    "this means that in a state described by a charge configuration @xmath46 and a spin configuration @xmath47 , the electron situated in the lattice site @xmath18 is in the spin state @xmath48 .",
    "more precisely , there is no unique connection between the spin configurations and permutations .",
    "a permutation uniquely determines a spin configuration , but the reverse is not true .",
    "let @xmath49 be a permutation which rearranges the elements of the subset @xmath50 , and rearranges the elements of @xmath51 , but does not interchange the elements of these two subsets .",
    "it is clear for arbitrary permutation @xmath21 , that @xmath21 and @xmath52 describe the same spin configuration , because @xmath53 for all @xmath18 .",
    "mathematically this means the following .",
    "the above defined permutations @xmath54 form a subgroup @xmath55 , and a right coset @xmath56 is in one - to - one correspondence with a spin configuration .",
    "moreover , the hilbert space generated by these right cosets as an orthonormalized basis , is isomorphic with a right ideal of the group algebra , which will be denoted by @xmath57 . on this line , an arbitrary state with given @xmath26 ,",
    "can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath61 is a basis of @xmath41 , and @xmath62 is a basis of @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the explicit expression of the above defined basis with the usual creation operators is @xmath63 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary permutation of the right coset @xmath64 .",
    "now it can be seen that the requirement that @xmath65 have to be increasingly ordered is needed to fix the order of the creation operators in eq.([basis ] ) .",
    "let @xmath66 a permutation which rearranges the first @xmath3 numbers and leaves unchanged the last @xmath67 ones . using @xmath68 instead of @xmath38 in eq.([basis ] ) , we get the same operators but in different order , supposing that it is also @xmath69 which is used to label the occupied sites from 1 to @xmath3 .",
    "this rearrange of the creation operators involves a sign @xmath70 .",
    "to avoid this sign ambiguity , we use @xmath38 in eq.([basis ] ) , for which the order of the operators is well determined due to the requirement for the order of @xmath71 .",
    "now we study the changing of a state vector from eq.([basis ] ) during the motion of the particles .",
    "let s study the hopping of particles step - by - step .",
    "suppose , that the starting point is @xmath72 and in the first step an electron hops from site @xmath73 to site @xmath74 , in the next step an other electron ( or the same ) from @xmath75 to @xmath76 and so on .",
    "the path in the charge configuration space @xmath77 is uniquely determined by the sequence of nearest neighbour pairs @xmath78 . in the @xmath22th",
    "step a hole and an electron interchange their positions .",
    "this can be described by the transposition @xmath79 .",
    "now we suppose , that after @xmath80 steps the system gets back to the original charge configuration .",
    "however the positions of holes are the same as in the original situation , the moving rearranged the electrons .",
    "the electron situated originally at site @xmath18 moved to site @xmath81 .",
    "the new situation can be described by a permutation @xmath82 where @xmath83 which takes @xmath18 to @xmath81 for all @xmath18 which label occupied sites and permutes somehow the labels of empty sites . because the spin state of the electron remains unchanged during the hopping , the electron situated after the motion in site @xmath84 is in the spin state @xmath85 .",
    "the charge configuration is the same as the starting @xmath86 therefore to recognize the final spin state @xmath87 we have to write the final spin state of the electon situated in site @xmath81 as @xmath88 . as a consequence ,",
    "we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an element of @xmath91 but it rearranges the first @xmath3 numbers among themself and leaves unchanged the last @xmath67 ones , therefore it can be considered as an element of @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore the final charge configuration is again @xmath93 instead of @xmath94 therefore we have to take into account a sign @xmath95  as we mentioned at the end of the previous section  to write the final state as @xmath96    the mapping @xmath97 is defined on the basis of @xmath98 . the influence caused by a hopping of holes along a loop @xmath99",
    "is described by a linear operator which is the linear extension of the mapping @xmath100 to the whole @xmath57 .",
    "it is actually a linear representation of the symmetric group @xmath92 on @xmath57 ( gurin and gulcsi , 2000 ) hereafter denoted by @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "based on the above considerations , we can give expressions for the partition function as follows @xmath102 and the expectational value of the square of the total spin @xmath103 in which the sum over the spin degrees of freedom is expressed analitically in terms of the characters of the symmetric group .",
    "from the above expressions it can be seen that what we need for calculations is in fact @xmath104     \\ : | \\ : \\bar{\\cal p } \\ : \\rangle \\ :   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\ : \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\ : \\frac{1}{l \\ : ! } \\ : \\left(\\frac{t}{k \\ : t}\\right)^l \\ : \\sum_{\\tilde{\\cal r } } \\ : \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\omega_{\\tilde{\\cal r}}(l ) }     \\chi^{s^z } ( \\ : { \\cal p}_{\\gamma } \\ : ) .",
    "\\label{ter3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 denotes the set of the @xmath80-length loops ( closed pathes ) with starting point @xmath38 in the space of charge configurations , and @xmath106 is the character of the representation @xmath107 .",
    "every character is constant on an arbitrary conjugate class @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the above sum over @xmath109 has @xmath110 identical members , where @xmath110 represents the number of the loops with length @xmath80 and starting point @xmath46 for which @xmath111 .",
    "now we use ( see gurin and gulcsi , 2000 ) @xmath112 furthermore @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the parity of permutations from the conjugate class @xmath108 and @xmath115 describes their cycle structure , i.e. these permutations contain @xmath116 cycles with length @xmath18 .    finally , inserting eqs.([ter3],[sum_of_chi],[sum2_of_chi ] ) into eqs.([ter2],[ter1 ] ) we obtain @xmath117 and @xmath118    to determine the coefficients @xmath110 we should follow the following procedure . starting from a charge configuration @xmath38 , holes moves @xmath80 steps in such a way that finally the sysyem goes back to the original hole configuration ( this is a loop with length @xmath80 ) . in this process , an arbitrary hole can be moved in every step , the order of the steps being relevant .",
    "a step means that we interchange a hole with an electron from its neighbourhood .",
    "counting the number of @xmath80-loops for which the cycle structure of the permutation of electrons after the @xmath80th step is @xmath108 , we get the number @xmath110 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath119 can be determined by monte carlo method . by random sampling",
    "we can obtain the percentage of loops with a given length for which @xmath120 .",
    "the eqs.([z ] ) and ( [ s^2 ] ) have the advantage that the trace over the spin degrees of freedom has been taken already .",
    "hence we need only to sample the loops ( i.e. `` world lines '' ) of holes instead of the loops of the electrons .",
    "this is advantageous since due to the presence of different possible electron spin configurations , the electron loops have @xmath121 times more starting points than the hole loops .",
    "we studied by this method a 2d @xmath0 lattice with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of two holes .",
    "we took into account every possible starting hole ( charge ) configuration .",
    "because of the periodic boundary conditions , translational , rotational and reflection symmetries of the lattice , there are 20 essentially different charge configurations instead of @xmath122 . because of the fact that the contributions of the @xmath123 different spin configurations corresponding to a fixed charge configuration are taken into account analitycally by eqs.([z],[s^2 ] ) , we have taken into account every possible strating point of loops .",
    "furthermore , starting from a charge configuration , we took into consideration every path up to the length @xmath124 .",
    "thus , we counted exactly every loop up to @xmath125 , therefore the coefficients of our high temperature expansion are exact up to 14th order in @xmath126 .",
    "the results can be seen in the fig .",
    "1 . the continuous lines show the result of the high temperature expansion with exact coefficients up to 14th order . taking into account further coefficients determined by monte carlo method up to 50th order we get the short - dash lines , and up to 100th order we get the long - dash lines .",
    "the expectation value of the square of the total spin goes to @xmath127 ( and not to zero ) as @xmath128 goes to infinity .",
    "it is understandable , because at very high temperature the likelyhood of every possible states become equally @xmath129 .",
    "( the spectrum of the hamiltonian is bounded . ) therefore , the expectation value of an arbitrary quantity goes to its simple algebraic average over the all states .",
    "this gives the result mentioned above for @xmath130 ) .",
    "this means in fact paramagnetic behaviour , because a smaller total spin value has greater thermodynamic weigh , i.e. the dimension of the eigensubspace of @xmath131 is greater , therefore the @xmath132 subspace is the greatest one , so this is the most probable value of the spin . because of this reason , the total spin ( but not @xmath133 ) per particle is proportional to @xmath134 which goes to zero in thermodynamical limit .    because of the inaccuracy and the complete neglection of the higher order coefficients in our expressions , the numerical error increases as the temperature decreases .",
    "therefore we do not plot the @xmath135 temperature region in fig .",
    "1 . nevertheless , in the presented region the results are correct since the higher order terms do not improve the lower order contributions in this domain . at these temperatures",
    "however , due to the monte carlo method itself , small numerical errors are present of about @xmath136 .",
    "the obtained results show that the spontaneous magnetization increases as the temperature decreases .",
    "this tendency becomes stronger when we use more accurate approximation . at the same temperature range when @xmath137 starts to increase",
    ", the specific heat has a maximum .",
    "hovewer this peak in the specific heat seems to be significant  in higher order approximations the curves have to break down as well since the specific heat has to go to zero in @xmath135 limit ,  but the increase in @xmath138 is small , nevertheless very fast .",
    "related to the two and few hole cases in the literature it have been published ( doucot and wen 1989 , st 1991 a , tth 1991 ) that the ground state can not have maximal spin .",
    "this statement is based on variational calculations .",
    "there exists trial state with spin @xmath139 which have lower energy than the fully polarized state with spin @xmath140 .",
    "however , up to now nobody can construct variational state with spin @xmath141 which would have lower energy , thus these results do not exclude the ferromagnetic behaviour , only the highest spin value .",
    "simultaneously our results suggest that the very low spin values can be exclude as well , and the ground state is not a singlet . as a conclusion we may state that the system behave at low temperature as a not fully saturated ferromagnet .",
    "this is consistent with exact diagonalization results for small clusters ( arrachea 2000 ) .",
