    "x - ray binaries are the brightest x - ray sources in the sky .",
    "they are powered by the accretion of material from the secondary star onto a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "the accretion regime depends on the spectral type of the companion . in high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb )",
    "the secondary star is an o or b star with a strong stellar wind which is intercepted and accreted by the compact object . though an accretion disk may also be present ,",
    "the secondary star is dominating the optical emission of the source . in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) , the secondary star is of a type later than a and the accretion occurs through loche robe overflow .",
    "the optical emission during outburst is in this case dominated by the x - ray heated companion , the outer disk and/or reprocessed hard x - rays .",
    "the generally accepted picture for the x - ray emission of accreting black holes consists of an accretion disk , responsible for thermal black body emission in the x - ray band ; and a surrounding hot corona , origin site of non - thermal power - law emission , up to the energy range of gamma - ray telescopes , due to inverse comptonization of soft x - ray photons from the accretion disk .    at present ,",
    "around 20 x - ray binaries contain a dynamically confirmed black hole , and around another 20 are the so called black - hole candidates @xcite .",
    "seven of the 20 confirmed black holes , and 12 of the black - hole candidates are transient sources with only one unique outburst observed .",
    "xte  j1817 - 330 was discovered by the rossi x - ray timing experiment ( rxte ) on 26 january 2006 @xcite with a flux of 0.93(@xmath0 )  crab ( 2 - 12 kev ) and a very soft spectrum , typical for black hole transients . the rxte light - curve of xte  j1817 - 330 reached a maximum of 1.9  crab on 2006 january 28 , and then declined exponentially , with an e - folding time of 27 days . following the initial discovery , the radio , near infrared and optical counterparts were identified @xcite .",
    "the x - ray transient xte  j1856 + 053 was discovered with rxte / pca during a survey of the galactic ridge in 1996 @xcite .",
    "the rxte / asm light - curve of the 1996 outburst showed two peaks ( fig .",
    "[ lcs ] ) : a first symmetric one starting on 1996 april 4 , 27 days long in total and with a maximum of 75  mcrab ( 212  kev ) ; and a second fast rise  slow decay ( fred ) peak starting on 1996 sept . 9 , lasting for 70 days , and reaching a maximum flux of 79  mcrab @xcite . the second x - ray peak was preceded 8 days before by a high - energy ( 20100  kev ) precursor of 3060  mcrab detected by batse on 1996 sept .",
    "79 @xcite . a new outburst of xte  j1856 + 053 was detected on 2007 february 28 @xcite .",
    "as in 1996 , the rxte / asm light curve of the 2007 outburst shows two peaks , preceded by a precursor on 2007 january 1015 ( fig .",
    "[ lcs ] ) .",
    "the first peak reached a maximum of @xmath185  mcrab on march 12 and lasted for @xmath165  days .",
    "the second peak in 2007 rose in only 7 days to @xmath1110  mcrab , and lasted for @xmath155  days .",
    "as in the case of the second maximum in 1996 , the two 2007 peaks were preceded by hard x - ray precursors detected by swift / bat ( 10200  kev ) in the periods february 22 to march 1 , and 2007 may 2830 @xcite .",
    "short after the start of the outburst of xte  j1817 - 330 , we triggered a target of opportunity observation ( too ) with xmm - newton ( 0.1 - 10.0  kev ) which was executed on the first xmm - newton visibility window of the source , on 2006 march 13 ( obs .",

    "was used in the burst mode for xte  j1817 - 330 and in timing mode for xte  j1856 + 053 to avoid pile - up , while the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs,0.32.0  kev ) was operated in spectroscopy high count rate mode .",
    "the optical monitor ( om ) was used in fast mode with the u and uwv1 filters for xte  j1817 - 330 , and with the u filter for xte  j1856 + 053 .",
    "xmm - newton data were reduced with the xmm - newton science analysis software v7.1 , and xspec 11.3 was used for spectral analysis . in the case of xte  j1817 - 330 ,",
    "the source is clearly detected with the om both in u and uvw1 , with ab magnitudes u@xmath2 and uvw1@xmath3 .",
    "the epic - pn and rgs spectra are fit together in this case with the om u and uwv1 data , which provide an extra constraint to the absorption and the accretion disk . in the case of xte",
    "j1856 + 053 , the source is not detected in the om images , with an upper limit for the ab magnitude in the u band during outburst of 23 mag .",
    "we use a 2-component model consisting of a thermal accretion disk plus a comptonization component ( _ comptt _ model @xcite ) to fit the spectra of xte  j1817 - 330 and xte  j1856 + 053 .",
    "the standard thermal accretion disk model is composed by the sum of black bodies from surface temperatures depending on the radius as @xmath4 @xcite ( _ diskbb _ model in _ xspec _ ) .",
    "since this model neglects the torque - free boundary condition , the temperature distribution is not accurate for the innermost disk when it extends down to the innermost stable orbit .",
    "the _ diskpn _ model in _ xspec _",
    "@xcite includes corrections for the temperature distribution near the black hole by taking into account the torque - free inner - boundary condition .",
    "we use here the _ diskpn _ model , fixing the inner radius to 6@xmath5 .    for xte  j1817 - 330",
    ", we obtain the best fit for the _ diskpn + comptt _ model ( @xmath6 ) with @xmath7 , a disk with @xmath8 and a comptonization component with kt@xmath9  kev ( fixed ) and @xmath10 .",
    "the observed x - ray flux is @xmath11 ( 0.4 - 10  kev ) , and the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of the source at the time of the observation l@xmath12 .    in the case of xte",
    "j1856 + 053 , no indication of a hard component is evident in the residuals , but an excess is present below 1 kev , leading to a poor reduced @xmath13 of 1.99 . adding a recombination emission edge at 0.87  kev ( corresponding to o  viii  k - shell ) with plasma temperature kt@xmath14  ev improves the fit .",
    "the significance of this feature is however to be taken with care , since the excess could be caused by some redistribution of higher energy photons to lower energies not properly taken into account by the calibration . the best fit ( @xmath15 )",
    "is then obtained with @xmath16 , and a disk ( _ diskpn _ model ) with @xmath17 .",
    "the observed x - ray flux is @xmath18 ( 0.510.0  kev ) , which corrected for absorption corresponds to an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity l@xmath19 .",
    "the low temperature of the accretion disk favours a black - hole as the accreting compact object both in xte  j1817 - 330 and xte  j1856 + 053 .",
    "an upper limit for the compact object mass can be obtained from the x - ray spectrum . the normalization constant _ k _ of the _ diskpn _ model is related to the mass of the compact object _ m _ , the distance to the source _ d _ , and the inclination _",
    "i _ of the disk as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the color / effective temperature ratio .",
    "furthermore , the accretion rate can be obtained from the mass of the compact object and the maximum temperature of the disk @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath22 and using the best fit value for the normalization of the _ diskpn _ model for xte  j1817 - 330 ( @xmath23 ) , we can compare the accretion rate for different possible masses , distances , and inclinations with an upper limit for the accretion rate . at the time of the xmm - newton observation of xte  j1817 - 330 ,",
    "the flux of the source had decreased by a factor 6 with respect to the maximum registered by rxte .",
    "taking the eddington limit as the upper limit for the accretion rate at the maximum of the outburst , the accretion rate at the time of the observation could not be higher than 16% of @xmath24 .",
    "this sets an upper limit for the mass of the central object of 6  m@xmath25 ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in the case of xte  j1856 + 053 , @xmath26 . at the time of the xmm - newton observations , the flux of the source was at the maximum of the first outburst detected in march 2007 .",
    "however , a brighter outburst was detected by rxte / asm in june 2007 . at the time of our xmm - newton observations , the flux was 70% of the maximum detected in june 2007 . taking the eddington limit as the upper limit for the accretion rate at the maximum in june 2007 ,",
    "the accretion rate at the time of the xmm - newton observation could not be higher than @xmath27 .",
    "this sets an upper limit for the mass of the central object of 4.2  m@xmath25 .",
    "we note , however , that our estimation for the upper limits of the compact object mass depends on the color correction factor .",
    "the value adopted here ( @xmath22 ) is rather conservative in comparison , for example , to @xmath28 obtained by shrader & titarchuk @xcite .",
    "a larger color correction factor would , of course , imply a larger upper limit for the black hole mass .",
    "the absorption column obtained for xte  j1817 - 330 is in agreement with the low absorption already pointed out at the discovery of the source with rxte @xcite ) , and confirmed later in uv and x - rays @xcite .",
    "the low absorption towards xte  j1817 - 330 makes this new black hole candidate an ideal target for optical observations in the quiescent state , which could provide the dynamical confirmation of the presence of a black hole in the system .",
    "the type of the secondary star can be constrained from the non - detection of the sources in quiescence .",
    "xte  j1817 - 330 was not detected previous to the outburst in the digitized sky survey ( dss , v@xmath2922  mag ) . with the extinction towards the source derived from the n@xmath30 , a@xmath31 ( using @xmath32 @xcite ) , the lower limit on the absolute magnitude is m@xmath33  mag ( for 10  kpc ) .",
    "a limit on the absolute magnitude of m@xmath33  mag implies that the secondary star must be a k - m star , and a giant can be excluded , even for a 10  kpc distance .",
    "we therefore conclude that xte  j1817 - 330 is a low - mass x - ray binary .    xte  j1856 + 053",
    "was observed on 26 august 2007 with grond @xcite , a 7-channel imager mounted at the mpi / eso 2.2 m telescope at la silla ( chile ) .",
    "the source was not detected in a 8-minute exposure , with lower limits for the ir magnitudes of j@xmath120 , h@xmath119 , and k@xmath118 ( calibrated against 2mass ) .",
    "this rules out the presence of a massive secondary in xte  j1856 + 053 . even for a distance of 10  kpc",
    ", an o or b star would be detected with j@xmath1911 .",
    "we can thus classify xte  j1856 + 053 as a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "we can also use the grond non - detection to estimate a lower limit for the distance : for a faint m2 secondary ( the latest spectral type of a donor in a confirmed bh binary ; see tab . 1 in mcclintock & remillard @xcite ) , and",
    "with the extinction derived from the x - ray absorption column ( a@xmath34=6.7 , using @xmath32 and a@xmath34=0.282a@xmath35 @xcite ) the non - detection in the j band would set a lower limit for the distance of 1  kpc .",

    "we acknowledge the rxte / asm team for the public availability of the quick - look results .",
