    "the notion of _ sequential cohen - macaulayness _ is a nonpure generalization , due to stanley ( * ? ? ?",

    "just as pure shellability implies cohen - macaulayness , nonpure shellability implies sequential cohen - macaulayness .    in this paper",
    "we show that the most common cohen - macaulay preserving constructions on simplicial complexes and posets also preserve sequential cohen - macaulayness .",
    "this complements earlier results @xcite showing that these operations preserve nonpure shellability .",
    "we also discuss a nonpure version of quillen s concept @xcite of _ homotopy cohen - macaulayness _ , introduced by the authors in @xcite .",
    "this new concept is intermediate between nonpure shellability and sequential cohen - macaulayness .",
    "we show that the homotopy version of sequential cohen - macaulayness has the same strong topological consequences as that of ( nonpure ) shellability , namely having the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres of ( possibly ) varying dimensions .",
    "our primary goal is to extend results on cohen - macaulay simplicial complexes , that have proven to be useful , to sequentially cohen - macaulay simplicial complexes .",
    "some of the proofs are straightforward generalizations of the cohen - macaulay versions , while others require substantially new ideas . for basic facts from topological combinatorics",
    "we refer to the survey article by bjrner @xcite and for background in commutative algebra to the books by stanley @xcite and bruns & herzog @xcite .",
    "as was mentioned , the notion of sequential cohen - macaulayness was first defined in terms of commutative algebra by stanley . in @xcite",
    "he also gave a homological characterization , see appendix ii , where this is outlined .",
    "starting from stanley s homological characterization , two other homological characterizations were found by duval @xcite and wachs @xcite .",

    "the main result of section  [ constr ] is that sequential connectivity , sequential acyclicity , shcmness , and scmness are all preserved by taking joins .",
    "the proof of this in the pure case is quite simple , but in the nonpure case relies on a fiber lemma of quillen .",
    "there are several interesting poset consequences of this result , in particular a nice characterization of s(h)cm posets , and the result that s(h)cmness is preserved by taking products of posets with minimum elements .    in section  [ rank ] we prove some general results on induced subcomplexes of s(h)cm complexes that enable us to show that rank - selection on semipure posets preserves the s(h)cm property and that truncation on general posets also preserves the s(h)cm property .",
    "section  [ rankchar ] contains a poset analog of duval s characterization of scmness , which does not follow directly from duval s simplicial complex characterization .",
    "this leads to a characterization of scmness of semipure posets in terms of rank - selection , which extends a result in the pure case due to baclawski and garsia @xcite and walker @xcite .",
