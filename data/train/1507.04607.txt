    "<S> _ taylor dispersion @xcite is a textbook example of a phenomenon where spatial variations of a time - independent compressible velocity field , along with locally constant molecular diffusivity , lead to enhanced dispersion . here , external uniform forces lead to increased dispersion in the direction of the force . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is similar to that behind taylor dispersion in that particles with different trajectories experience very different advection by the applied force due to its coupling to the local mobility / diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> we have also seen that an external force can non - monotonically modify the dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the applied force . </S>",
    "<S> this surprising effect is due to the fact that an applied force yields a non - uniform stationary distribution over the fundamental periodic cell . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that one may construct experimental systems where the effects predicted here could be observed . </S>",
    "<S> periodic optical potentials , in which colloidal particles can be tracked , can be generated by lasers @xcite and it would be interesting to see if experimental realizations of media with spatially modulated diffusivities could be similarly produced in order to observe the effects predicted in this letter . finally , we stress that the results here can be applied to any periodic advection - diffusion system and thus have a wide range of applicability . for instance , one can use the formulas to study the dispersion in periodic potentials in _ any _ dimension in the presence of an external force @xcite ( even with varying local mobility ) as well as in systems with no local detailed balance , such as active particle systems .    * supplemental material * </S>"
