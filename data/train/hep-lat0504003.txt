    "although this is nominally the writeup of the talk delivered by jbk at the workshop on qcd in extreme environments , we have taken the liberty of updating our results to reflect the ` data ' from simulations performed since then .",
    "we have done this , since studies of the @xmath9 dependence of observables indicate that the binder cumulants for the chiral condensate have a strong enough dependence on @xmath9 to change our conclusions . for our earlier results",
    "one should see our contribution to lattice 2004 , fermilab @xcite .",
    "qcd at finite baryon / quark - number density and temperature is relevant to the physics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the various accelerators which probe this region of the phase diagram of nuclear matter include rhic , cern heavy - ion , ags and sis . between them they should map out a considerable region of this phase diagram .",
    "qcd and in particular lattice qcd , at a finite chemical potential @xmath8 for quark - number , have a complex fermion determinant with a real part of indefinite sign .",
    "for this reason standard simulation methods based on importance sampling can not be applied directly .",
    "various methods have been developed to circumvent this problem for small @xmath8 in the neighborhood of the finite temperature transition @xcite .",
    "the transition @xmath4s and hence temperatures for finite @xmath8 and for finite @xmath0 appear to be the same provided @xmath11 .",
    "this equality was noted by the bielefeld - swansea group @xcite and observed by us for the 2-flavor case @xcite .",
    "thus the phase of the determinant appears to be unimportant for determining the position of the transition .",
    "we have argued that this was because the fluctuations in the phase of the fermion determinant are moderate for small @xmath8 and high temperatures , on the lattice sizes we use .",
    "we speculate that the nature of the transition might also be insensitive to the phase of the determinant .",
    "if so , simulations at finite @xmath0 offer an alternative way to study the finite temperature transition at finite @xmath8 .",
    "lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 has a positive fermion determinant , so standard simulation methods work .",
    "we are now extending our simulations to the 3-flavor case . here",
    "we ignore the complication that at finite @xmath0 , this theory really describes qcd with @xmath12 @xmath13 quark flavors and @xmath12 @xmath14 quark flavors .",
    "this theory can be interpreted as 3-flavor qcd at finite @xmath15 where we use only the magnitude of the fermion determinant and ignore the phase .",
    "3 flavors are of interest because they are closer to the physical @xmath16 flavors .",
    "in addition , for quark mass @xmath17 , the phase transition is first order at @xmath18 becoming a crossover for @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the critical point at @xmath20 moves continuously to higher quark mass as @xmath8 is increased , where it becomes the sought - after critical endpoint @xcite .",
    "choosing a quark mass just above @xmath3 , one should be able to keep the critical endpoint as close to @xmath21 as desired .",
    "in particular , one should be able to keep the critical @xmath8 in the range where the @xmath8 and @xmath0 transitions are related .",
    "thus we might expect a critical endpoint at small @xmath0 , which we could determine by direct simulations .",
    "our initial simulations appeared to show evidence for this critical endpoint @xcite .",
    "however , the binder cumulants , which we use to determine the nature of the transition , depend strongly on @xmath9 .",
    "we are currently performing simulations to study this dependence to allow extrapolation to @xmath10 .",
    "indications are that the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath10 cumulants is rather weak .",
    "this observation is consistent with what was predicted from analytic continuation from imaginary @xmath8 by de forcrand and philipsen @xcite .",
    "however , our preliminary measurments favor a slow increase with increasing @xmath0 while their measurements favor a slow decrease with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "considerable more work will be needed to identify the critical endpoint _ if _ it exists .    in section",
    "2 we introduce our formulation of lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 and discuss its relationship to qcd at finite @xmath8 .",
    "section  3 describes our current simulations of 3-flavor lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 and gives preliminary results . in section",
    "4 we give our conclusions and discuss what remains to be done .",
    "the staggered quark action for lattice qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath0 is @xcite @xmath22\\chi                     + i\\lambda\\epsilon\\bar{\\chi}\\tau_2\\chi\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the normal staggered @xmath24 for a staggered fermion field @xmath25 with 2 explicit flavor components , and @xmath26 are the isospin pauli spin matrices acting on this flavor space , with the links in the @xmath27 direction multiplied by @xmath28 and those in the @xmath29 direction multiplied by @xmath30 .",
    "explicit @xmath31 symmetry breaking is provided by the term proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is only needed for @xmath34 where , in the low temperature phase , @xmath31 is broken spontaneously by a charged pion condensate .",
    "the fermion determinant is @xmath35^\\dagger               [ d\\!\\!\\!\\!/(\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_i)+m ] + \\lambda^2 \\right\\}. \\label{eqn : det}\\ ] ] where in this case @xmath24 is only a @xmath36 matrix in isospin space , which means that we only need use a single flavour - component fermion field in our simulations .",
    "this determinant is real and positive allowing us to use standard hybrid molecular - dynamics simulations with noisy fermions , to allow us to tune the number of flavors from 8 down to @xmath37 . here",
    "we will choose @xmath38 , even though this represents @xmath12 isodoublets and probably does not have a sensible continuum limit .    when @xmath39 , this determinant is the magnitude of the fermion determinant at finite @xmath40 , so simulating at finite @xmath0 is equivalent to simulating at finite @xmath8 using only the magnitude of the determinant and neglecting the phase .",
    "hence , the theory we are considering corresponds to the 3-flavor theory at quark number chemical potential @xmath8 , in which the phase of the fermion determinant has been set to zero .",
    "we will argue that for small enough @xmath8 , the phase @xmath41 of the determinant is well enough behaved , that it does not affect the position of the finite temperature transition .    for simplicity let us consider a gluonic observable @xmath42 .",
    "its expectation value at finite @xmath8 is given by the ratio @xmath43 where @xmath41 is the phase of the fermion determinant .",
    "if the denominator @xmath44 is reasonably large and varies smoothly as @xmath4 crosses the transition at fixed @xmath0 , i.e. it varies considerably more slowly than @xmath45 for the volume considered , it will not have much effect on the transition .",
    "we can therefore consider @xmath46 as our observable and , to the extent to which the position of the transition is independent of the observable , the finite @xmath8 transition and the finite @xmath0 transition will be coincident .",
    "it is not unreasonable to assume that the nature of the two transitions will also be the same .",
    "because this argument only works for finite volumes , it should be considered as a plausibility argument rather than a proof .",
    "we are simulating the 3-flavor theory at finite temperature and small @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath47 , since the transition to the phase where isospin ( @xmath31 ) is broken by a charged pion condensate occurs at @xmath48 for zero temperature . since no such condensed phase exists for qcd at finite @xmath8 , the physics at finite @xmath8 and that at finite @xmath0 can at best be related for @xmath47 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "our simulations are being performed on @xmath50 lattices where the zero - chemical - potential finite - temperature phase transition is first order for @xmath51 and a crossover for @xmath52 , with @xmath53 . at @xmath54 ,",
    "the transition is a critical point in the universality class of the 3-dimensional ising model .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased , @xmath3 is expected to increase so that the @xmath55 becomes the critical endpoint .",
    "fixing @xmath6 to lie just above @xmath56 , the transition should be a crossover for @xmath57 with @xmath58 the solution of @xmath59 . for @xmath60 , the transition should become first order .",
    "the critical endpoint should again lie in the ising universality class . from the observation that the @xmath8 and @xmath0 transitions seem to be related",
    ", one might expect a corresponding endpoint for finite @xmath0 .",
    "we are performing simulations at @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "most of our effort has been concentrated on @xmath62 , just above @xmath56 , where we might hope to find a critical endpoint for small @xmath0 .",
    "our simulations are being performed on @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 lattices .",
    "figure  [ fig : wilson0.035 ] shows the wilson line from our @xmath64 simulations at @xmath62 for several values of @xmath47 .",
    "the values of @xmath9 used for each of the @xmath0 values used in these simulations are @xmath67 for @xmath68 , @xmath69 at @xmath70 , @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "the length of the simulations for each of those @xmath4 values closest to the transition for each @xmath0 is 160,000 time - units(trajectories ) .",
    "we study the nature of these transitions using 4-th order binder cumulants @xcite .",
    "if @xmath42 is an observable , its binder cumulant is defined by @xmath75 the binder cumulant of interest is that for the chiral condensate . since we only measure stochastic estimators of the chiral condensate , we need at least 4 independent stochastic estimates of @xmath76 for each configuration to obtain an unbiased estimate of @xmath77  we actually use 5 noise vectors for each configuration .    on a lattice of infinite spatial extent ,",
    "@xmath78 would be @xmath79 for a crossover and @xmath80 for a first order transition , while for a critical point in the ising universality class it would have the value @xmath81 .",
    "for finite lattices @xmath78 will lie above the ising value in the crossover region and below this value in the first - order regime , passing smoothly through a value close to the ising value at the critical endpoint . as the size of the spatial lattice",
    "is increased , the curve will pass more steeply through the ising value .",
    "the critical endpoint can be obtained by observing where the curves for different lattice sizes cross , or where the curve for a given large lattice passes through the ising value .",
    "ideally one should use several spatial volumes , observe where the curves cross , and check that the value of @xmath77 at this point is ( close to ) the ising value .",
    "preliminary indications based on simulations with the @xmath9 values given above showed some evidence for such a critical endpoint .",
    "however , it was observed that , while the value of @xmath77 fell with increasing @xmath0 at @xmath82 , it began to increase again long before @xmath83 .",
    "this suggested that we should study the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath77 .",
    "we are now performing a detailed finite @xmath9 analysis .",
    "what we find is that the @xmath9 dependence of the fluctuation quantities  @xmath78 and the susceptibility @xmath84  is considerable , something we had also observed in the 2 flavor case at @xmath85 .",
    "the preliminary results of this analysis which we present below indicate that considerable work will be needed to determine whether there is evidence for a critical endpoint , and if so , determine its position .",
    "figure  [ fig : b4_mu0 ] shows the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath77 for the chiral condensate for @xmath62 and @xmath2 from our @xmath65 runs at @xmath9 values of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "each point is the value of @xmath77 obtained from performing a ferrenberg - swendsen extrapolation @xcite to its minimum from @xmath4 values close to the transition .",
    "we have noted that the values of @xmath5 obtained from the minima of @xmath77 and from the maxima of the chiral susceptibility are consistent . we have averaged the results obtained from 2 or 3 different @xmath4 values close to the transition , for each @xmath9 .",
    "the length of the runs at each @xmath4 was 160,000 @xmath90 trajectories .",
    "we also noted that the values of @xmath5 obtained from different @xmath4s and the same @xmath9 were consistent .",
    "we note considerable variation of @xmath77 over the range of @xmath9s used in these runs .",
    "a fit linear in @xmath91 gives @xmath92 with a @xmath93 of @xmath94 .",
    "this shows that , for @xmath95 the finite @xmath9 error @xmath96% . even at @xmath67 which we used for our earlier simulations the error @xmath97% .",
    "this also shows that finite @xmath9 errors can take one from @xmath98 , which is normally interpreted as a crossover to @xmath99 which is commonly interpreted as indicative of a first order transition .",
    "we are performing similar calculations of the finite @xmath9 dependence of @xmath77 for the chiral condensate for @xmath100 .",
    "preliminary results are shown in figure  [ fig : b4_mu>0 ] .",
    "again we see a strong dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath9 . because @xmath101 makes the dirac operator more singular , smaller @xmath9 values are required as @xmath0",
    "is increased .",
    "an extrapolation linear in @xmath91 to @xmath10 gives @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "the rise in @xmath77 with increasing @xmath0 , although suggestive , is not statistically significant .",
    "all we can claim at present is that there is little if any dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath0 over this range .",
    "for completeness we plot these extrapolated values of @xmath77 in figure  [ fig : b4dt=0 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath5 , the transition @xmath4 are calculated from the minima of @xmath77 .",
    "we have noted that these estimate of @xmath5 are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the maxima of the susceptibilities for the chiral condensate . extrapolating these to @xmath10 , linearly in @xmath91",
    ", we obtain the results shown in figure  [ fig : beta_c ] .",
    "the statistical errors are small , but there are large systematics associated with this preliminary ` data ' .",
    "the straight line fit shown in the figure is : @xmath106 we do not quote any errors because of the preliminary nature of this result .",
    "if we interpret @xmath11 as we have suggested , this is in good agreement with the measurements of de forcrand and philipsen @xcite .",
    "it is helpful to consider why the transition appears more like a first - order transition as @xmath9 is increased from zero .",
    "a brief discussion of this was given in our 2-flavor paper @xcite .",
    "one of the effects of simulating at a finite @xmath9 using the hybrid molecular - dynamics method , which is an inexact algorithm , is that the effective @xmath4 value @xmath107 measured from the kinetic term in the molecular - dynamics hamiltonian using the equipartition theorem is ( on the average ) less than the input @xmath4 , so that we are effectively running at a lower @xmath4 value .",
    "the quantity @xmath108 increases with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "this would not be a problem if the shift were roughly constant as @xmath4 was varied across the transition",
    ". however , this is not the case for a constant @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath109 is significantly larger below the transition than above .",
    "we illustrate this from our simulations at @xmath2 , @xmath62 , @xmath39 and @xmath67 on an @xmath64 lattice , where we have ` data ' at a number of @xmath4 values over a range which includes the transition .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : beff ] .",
    "now let us consider what the effect of such @xmath4 dependence for @xmath109 has on the behavior of the simulation close to the transition . here",
    ", a small change in @xmath4 causes a relatively large change in @xmath107 .",
    "this causes a relatively large change in all observables .",
    "this , in turn , makes the transition appear more abrupt and hence nearer to being first - order .",
    "looking at this in another way , @xmath107 needs to undergo a relatively large fluctuation to take it from one side of the transition to the other .",
    "this makes it more difficult for the system to fluctuate between its low-@xmath4 domain and its high-@xmath4 domain .",
    "such a tendency to remain in one domain or the other , only ` tunneling ' between domains rather infrequently , is a property one associates with first - order behavior .",
    "hence the transition will appear to be closer to a first - order transition than it really is .",
    "these considerations are in accord with our observations .",
    "we are simulating 3-flavor lattice qcd with a chemical potential @xmath0 for isospin ( @xmath31 ) , at small @xmath0 and temperatures close to the finite temperature transition from hadronic / nuclear matter to a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "these simulations are being performed on @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 lattices . in this regime ,",
    "the behavior of qcd at finite @xmath0 and that at finite quark - number chemical potential @xmath8 appear similar for @xmath11 .",
    "qcd at finite @xmath8 and qcd at finite @xmath0 are related if one can neglect the phase angle of the determinant , or include it in the observables .",
    "the decrease in @xmath5 with increasing @xmath0 that we have observed is consistent with that seen by de forcrand and philipsen if we make the substitution @xmath40 , which adds further support to the proposition that finite @xmath8 and finite @xmath0 are related .    at zero chemical potentials there",
    "exists a critical mass @xmath3 . for @xmath17",
    "the finite temperature transition is first order . for @xmath19",
    "this transition is a mere crossover , with no real phase transition . at @xmath20",
    "the transition is a critical point in the universality class of the 3-dimensional ising model . for staggered lattices with @xmath50 ,",
    "it has been suggested that at finite @xmath8 , the critical mass @xmath55 moves continuously ( in @xmath8 ) to higher values , where it becomes the critical endpoint .",
    "hence the best place to look for a critical endpoint in @xmath8 or @xmath0 should be for a quark mass just above @xmath3 where it would be expected to be found at a small chemical potential .",
    "for this reason most of our simulations have been performed at @xmath62 .",
    "we have used 4-th order binder cumulants for the chiral condensate to determine the nature of the finite temperature transition .",
    "a critical endpoint would be where the binder cumulants for different lattice sizes cross . at this point",
    "its value should be close to the ising value @xmath81 .",
    "although our preliminary results appeared to show evidence for such an endpoint , further simulations studying the finite @xmath9 dependence of this cumulant showed the finite @xmath9 errors to be large at the @xmath9s we were using .",
    "our current estimates show the extrapolated cumulants to lie well above the ising value for the @xmath0 range being considered .",
    "there is no indication that these cumulants are falling with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "in fact our measurements show a slight rise with increasing @xmath0 . however , this rise is not statistically significant , especially considering that these preliminary measurements could have sizable systematic errors .",
    "all that we can claim is that the @xmath0 dependence of the binder cumulants is very weak over this range .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with what was observed at finite @xmath8 by de forcrand and philipsen , who observed a slight decrease in @xmath77 with increasing @xmath111 , but could not exclude a @xmath77 which is independent of @xmath111 .",
    "if we do not find evidence for a @xmath77 which decreases with increasing @xmath0 at this quark mass , we should check the situation even closer to @xmath3 .",
    "the lack of any critical end point , even for @xmath6 much closer to ( but still above ) @xmath3 would suggest that similar behavior would be found at small @xmath8 , since our estimates of the fluctuations of the phase angle as determined from @xmath112 ( @xmath41 is the phase of the fermion determinant at @xmath40 ) indicate that it is reasonably well behaved for @xmath62 over most of the region @xmath47 for an @xmath64 lattice .",
    "this , in turn , would suggest that the critical endpoint at finite @xmath8 ( if it exists ) is fluctuation induced .",
    "thus we would expect to find it where fluctuations in @xmath41 become large , i.e. for @xmath113 .",
    "if so , it would not move continuously away from @xmath21 as @xmath6 becomes larger than @xmath3 , but might be expected to jump from @xmath21 to @xmath114 , as @xmath6 is increased beyond @xmath3 .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath9 suggests that we should investigate the use of recently formulated exact algorithms ( see @xcite and references contained therein ) , for our simulations .",
    "since such methods rely on stochastic approximations to the fermion determinant , they could also help us in applying reweighting by the phase of the fermion determinant as a way of studying finite @xmath8 in a quantitative fashion , to obtain the equation - of - state .",
    "here we note recent work indicating that finite @xmath0 simulations provide a better platform for reweighting than reweighting from simulations at @xmath21 @xcite .",
