    "there exist many nucleon - nucleon potentials which reproduce phase shifts and nuclear properties with remarkable accuracy  @xcite .",
    "three fundamental features are shared by these potential models : ( i ) pions dominate at long distances , ( ii ) there is some source of intermediate - range attraction , and ( iii ) there is some source of short - distance repulsion . however , in general , distinct physical mechanisms in these models account for the same feature of the nuclear force .",
    "agreement with experiment is maintained in spite of these differences because of the large number of fit parameters .",
    "it would be a considerable advance if a systematic approach to the nucleon - nucleon interaction could be developed based solely on symmetries and general physical principles .",
    "systematic approaches to the scattering of strongly interacting particles , such as chiral perturbation theory , are based on the ideas of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "effective field theory says that for probes of a system at momentum @xmath2 , details of the dynamics at scale @xmath3 are unimportant .",
    "what is important at low energies is the physics that can be captured in operators of increasing dimensionality which take the form of a power - series in the quantity @xmath4",
    "it is important to realize that even if eft ideas can be applied to the @xmath0 system they will probably not lead to any startlingly new predictions for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "indeed , it is entirely possible that the resulting fits to phase shifts will not be as good as those produced by conventional @xmath0 potentials with the same number of parameters .",
    "however , the real motivation for constructing an eft is to relate one process to another .",
    "for instance , one would like to relate @xmath0 scattering systematically to scattering processes with more nucleons , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering , and to say something predictive about processes involving pionic and photonic probes of few - nucleon systems .",
    "one reason to hope that this can be achieved in nuclear physics is provided by the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . the fact that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken implies that the pion is light and interacts weakly at low energies",
    "of course the lightness of the pion in itself guarantees that it should play a fundamental role in nuclear physics .",
    "the weakness of pion interactions at low energies allows pion interactions with nucleons to be systematized using chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this procedure has proved remarkably successful in describing the interactions of pions with a single nucleon  @xcite .",
    "these ideas have been extended to processes involving more than one nucleon , leading to arguments concerning the relative importance of various pion - exchange mechanisms in the nuclear force  @xcite .",
    "however , these eft arguments assume the existence of a systematic power - counting scheme for multi - nucleon processes . in our view",
    "there is no convincing argument in the literature that such a power counting exists .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate this issue in the simplest possible context .",
    "naive transposition of eft ideas to nuclear physics immediately suggests a puzzle . in nuclear physics there",
    "are bound states whose energy is unnaturally small on the scale of hadronic physics . in order to generate such bound states within a `` natural '' theory",
    "it is clear that one must sum a series to all orders .",
    "therefore , weinberg proposed  @xcite implementing the eft program in nuclear physics by applying the power - counting arguments of chiral perturbation theory to an @xmath7-nucleon effective potential rather than directly to the s - matrix .",
    "only @xmath7-nucleon irreducible graphs should be included in the @xmath7-nucleon effective potential .",
    "the potential obtained in this way is then to be inserted into a lippmann - schwinger or schrdinger equation and iterated to all orders .",
    "there will of course be unknown coefficients in the effective potential , but these can be fit to experimental data as in ordinary chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "thus , an eft treatment of the @xmath0 interaction differs in a fundamental way from conventional eft applications like @xmath8 scattering in chiral perturbation theory . in both cases operators",
    "are ordered in an effective lagrangian in the same way . however , in @xmath9 scattering the operator expansion in the effective lagrangian maps to a power series in @xmath4 in the scattering amplitude .",
    "it is straightforward to see that eft treatments where there is a direct mapping from the lagrangian to the s - matrix are systematic  @xcite . on the other hand , when the mapping is from the lagrangian to an effective potential which is subsequently iterated to all orders , many issues arise which lead one to question the existence of a systematic power counting in the potential .    in order to raise some of these issues ,",
    "consider @xmath0 scattering in the @xmath10 channel at momentum scales @xmath11 .",
    "the eft at these scales involves only nucleons since the pion is heavy and may therefore be `` integrated out '' .",
    "the effective lagrangian thus consists of contact operators of increasing dimensionality constrained by spin and isospin . throughout the paper",
    "this is the eft which we consider .",
    "we do not intend that this eft should provide a quantitative description of the @xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "instead , we study it because scattering amplitudes can be calculated analytically .",
    "it therefore allows us to elucidate issues of principle in eft for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "one might naively expect to be able to calculate the @xmath0 scattering amplitude directly from the effective lagrangian as a power series in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the heavy scale in this problem .",
    "it is instructive to show in some detail why this fails and one is led to consider an expansion in the potential .",
    "consider an expansion of the amplitude in the @xmath14-wave channels :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , and , with the prevailing prejudice of eft , we anticipate that the dimensionless coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc",
    ". will be natural ; i.e. of order unity . we know that in the @xmath10 and @xmath19 channels there are , respectively , a quasi - bound state and a bound state at low energies .",
    "the power series expansion ( [ eq : texp ] ) with natural coefficients can only be correct if these bound states are at energies @xmath20 .",
    "however , in these channels the bound states occur at unnaturally low energies , i.e. at energies @xmath21",
    ". therefore , the coefficients in the expansion must be unnatural  they are fixed by the pole positions of the low - lying bound states rather than by the scale of the physics that has been integrated out .",
    "this limits the usefulness of an expansion in the amplitude to an extremely restricted domain of validity . on the other hand ,",
    "if one makes the following expansion of the potential in @xmath14-wave channels :    @xmath22    and iterates it via the lippmann - schwinger equation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] )    @xmath23    one may hope to generate ( quasi-)bound states at the appropriate energies while maintaining natural coefficients in the potential . at face value",
    "this procedure appears promising .",
    "the expansion ( [ eq : vexp ] ) may be truncated at some finite order in the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 and , provided @xmath26 the neglected terms will be small . however , in making the expansion in the potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vexp ] ) and then iterating , a number of issues arise which are absent in standard eft treatments , and which render this procedure suspect .",
    "in what follows we will identify and clarify some of these issues .",
    "first , the physical scattering amplitude that is generated when the potential ( [ eq : vexp ] ) is iterated is exactly unitary and therefore necessarily contains arbitrarily high powers in energy or momenta .",
    "this occurs regardless of the order to which one is working in the momentum expansion of the potential @xmath27 .",
    "this suggests that as long as one is interested in physics near the bound state pole  where exact unitarity is important  the scattering amplitude may be sensitive to physics at arbitrarily short - distance scales . while this observation does not necessarily invalidate the eft approach , it does mean that one should not simply translate intuition gained about how short - distance physics decouples in perturbative eft calculations ( e.g. in chiral perturbation theory ) to the non - perturbative problem at hand .",
    "thus , the first question we face is whether a systematic expansion in the potential translates to a systematic determination of the scattering amplitude .",
    "a necessary condition for this to occur is that the integrals in the ls equation , which formally extend up to infinity , be dominated by momenta of order @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the on - shell momentum , since otherwise there is no small parameter in the expansion ( [ eq : vexp ] ) for @xmath27 .",
    "second , non - perturbative regularization and renormalization is required when iterating to all orders using the ls equation .",
    "this is an issue because of the presence of ultraviolet divergences , which generally can arise in two ways .",
    "when explicit pions are included in the eft , the potential itself may contain loop graphs which require regularization and renormalization .",
    "these divergences are easily handled using standard perturbative methods .",
    "a second type of ultraviolet divergence arises because in solving the ls equation one integrates the potential over all momenta .",
    "given the hard asymptotic behavior inherent to the momentum expansion this necessarily introduces new divergences .",
    "the divergences which arise from iterating the potential become more severe as one goes to higher order in the eft expansion . these divergences apparently violate the assumption that @xmath30 , so the existence of a procedure to regularize these divergences and renormalize in such a way that the momentum scales probed inside loops are ultimately well below @xmath13 provides a non - trivial condition on the existence of an eft .    in ordinary perturbative eft ,",
    "all regularization schemes lead to the same renormalized amplitude .",
    "this insensitivity to the short - distance physics implied by the regulator makes perturbative eft methods like chiral perturbation theory possible .",
    "similarly , there is no hope of defining a sensible eft for @xmath0 scattering unless there is some degree of regulator independence .",
    "an interesting feature that arises when regularizing and renormalizing the lippmann - schwinger equation is that not all regulators lead to the same physical results .",
    "for instance , we will show that dimensional regularization ( dr ) and cutoff schemes lead to different physical scattering amplitudes .",
    "this result should give practitioners of eft pause , since it suggests a sensitivity to short - distance physics which violates the basic tenets of eft .",
    "we further demonstrate that in order to generate low - energy ( quasi-)bound states in the @xmath0 system within this eft , one must use a scale - dependent regulator .",
    "cutoff schemes provide the most physical means of regularizing the effective theory .",
    "we therefore focus on whether it is possible to implement the regularization and renormalization program in a consistent fashion using cutoff schemes . within this restricted class of regulators",
    "physical results are insensitive to the specific choice of regulator .",
    "however , we find that taking the cutoff to infinity requires that the effective range parameter in the scattering amplitude be negative . in physical processes of interest",
    "the effective range parameter is positive .",
    "the impossibility of maintaining a positive effective range when the cutoff is removed follows from an old theorem of wigner , which depends only on general physical principles  @xcite .",
    "therefore , either the cutoff must be kept finite or else all orders in the effective potential must be retained . using an extension of wigner s theorem to the eft where pions are explicitly included , we further argue that the inclusion of pions as explicit degrees of freedom in the eft does not resolve these difficulties .",
    "having found that an eft with only nucleons as explicit degrees of freedom can work only if there is a finite cutoff or regulator scale , we investigate the possibility of a cutoff effective field theory . in cutoff",
    "eft , cutoff dependence in physical observables is removed systematically by adding higher - dimensional operators to the effective action . however",
    ", this procedure makes sense only if there is a small parameter which allows one to conclude that higher - order operators in the action are negligible .",
    "we show that there is no such small parameter in @xmath0 scattering when there are low - energy ( quasi-)bound states .",
    "we stress that we _ are not _ questioning the existence of an effective field theory of @xmath0 scattering .",
    "since the principles underlying eft are causality and locality , an eft of @xmath0 scattering must exist unless a sacred principle is violated .",
    "the question we address is : `` what are the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom which must be included explicitly in the eft ? ''",
    "the problem of @xmath0 scattering is subtle in this respect because generally there are singularities at unnaturally low energies ( e.g. , the deuteron ) in scattering amplitudes .",
    "these singularities are not present as fields in the effective action .",
    "what our analysis here shows is that if low - lying bound states are present then there is no systematic eft for @xmath0 scattering in which there are only nucleon fields in the effective lagrangian .",
    "this would suggest the necessity of introducing the physics of ( quasi-)bound states in terms of explicit degrees of freedom in the eft description . a step in this direction has been taken in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in this paper we will not discuss such ideas further . therefore , we use the term eft to mean an effective field theory in which low - energy bound states are not included as fields in the effective action , i.e. an eft in which only nucleons ( and pions ) are explicit degrees of freedom .    in sec .  2 we discuss the @xmath10 channel in @xmath0 scattering and introduce a simple potential model that reproduces data remarkably well .",
    "this model demonstrates how an unnaturally small scale can emerge from a theory with only large scales . in sec .",
    "3 we review the effective field theory power - counting argument for @xmath0 scattering , originally proposed by weinberg .",
    "in particular , we examine arguments for power counting in the potential rather than in the amplitude in the @xmath0 problem . in sec .",
    "4 we perform a `` leading - order '' eft calculation for @xmath0 scattering in the @xmath10 channel and show that all regularization schemes give the same scattering amplitude . in sec .",
    "5 we perform a `` second - order '' eft calculation using cutoff regularization .",
    "we show that if a cutoff is introduced such that the regulated theory respects all physical principles , then the cutoff can not be taken to infinity .",
    "we discuss how this result relates to an old theorem of wigner . in sec .",
    "6 we compare dimensional regularization ( dr ) and cutoff regularization schemes .",
    "we show that dr and cutoff regularization give different physical scattering amplitudes in the second - order eft calculation , indicating that there is a sensitivity to the choice of regulator , and therefore to short - distance physics .",
    "we find that the presence of a regulator scale is necessary to reproduce unnaturally low - lying ( quasi- ) bound states . in sec .",
    "7 we consider the possibility of an effective field theory with a finite cutoff .",
    "we find that although a procedure whereby cutoff dependence in the amplitude is removed by adding higher orders in the effective potential can be defined , the small parameter which is necessary to conclude that this is systematic is simply not present .",
    "we summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "the @xmath31 phase shift in @xmath0 scattering is remarkably well reproduced ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) up to center of mass momenta of order @xmath13 by the first two terms in the effective - range expansion :    @xmath32 , \\label{eq : reamp}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the scattering length , @xmath34 is the effective range , and @xmath29 is the on - shell momentum , @xmath35 .",

    "it is a simple model for the @xmath10 channel which captures some of the salient features of the scattering .",
    "inserting this potential into the ls equation ( [ eq : lse ] ) gives the on - shell amplitude :    @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{m}{4\\pi}\\left [ \\frac{\\lambda}{g}(1+\\frac{k^2}{\\lambda^2 } ) -(\\lambda + ik)\\right ] .",

    "the expression for @xmath33 makes clear that an unnaturally large scattering length occurs if @xmath40 is `` accidentally '' close to one  . in this model",
    "the large scattering length is the result of a cancellation between two distinct contributions to the scattering amplitude .",
    "the first of these contributions comes from the `` strength '' of the potential ( the blob in fig .",

    "note that both of these contributions to @xmath49 are natural , i.e. given by @xmath50 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath51 there is a cancellation between the `` strength '' and the `` range '' , which results in an unnaturally large scattering length .",
    "we will see that this qualitative feature persists in the eft treatment .",
    "in its standard form chiral perturbation theory is not useful in @xmath0 scattering because of the presence of low - lying bound states which imply a breakdown of perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "weinberg argued that this breakdown manifests itself through the presence of infrared divergences in reducible loop graphs in the limit of static heavy nucleons .",
    "this argument is not entirely correct ",
    "it _ is _ possible to have a `` perturbative ''",
    "effective field theory for the interaction of heavy particles , provided that there are no low - lying bound or quasi - bound states .",
    "( see , for instance ref .",
    "however , since there _ are _ low - lying bound states in nuclear systems , weinberg s main point remains true : if power - counting arguments are relevant in nuclear physics , they must be applied to an effective potential , rather than to the scattering amplitude . in general , the effective @xmath0 potential is the sum of all two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) @xmath52 diagrams .",
    "when there are pions and nucleons in the eft , the effective potential contains pion - exchange diagrams , short - range contact interactions and a mixture of the two .",
    "however , in this paper we are interested in energy scales where @xmath13 is large compared to the initial and final momenta @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this case",
    "eft arguments imply that the pion can be integrated out and replaced by contact interactions .",
    "the starting point of any eft calculation is an effective lagrangian , where operators are ordered according to the number of derivatives .",
    "the most general effective lagrangian consistent with spin and isospin , including only operators relevant to @xmath10 scattering is    @xmath55    there are only tree graphs in the @xmath0 potential obtained from this lagrangian .",
    "hence there is a one - to - one correspondence between the operators in the effective lagrangian and the terms in the potential . when iterated using the lippmann - schwinger equation , this potential gives the full @xmath0 amplitude of the theory .",
    "this procedure is entirely equivalent to solving the quantum partition function with an effective action to a given order in the derivative expansion , and thereby generating the four - point correlation function .",
    "there is therefore , at least for this eft , actually no need to formulate the discussion in terms of potentials .",
    "nevertheless , here we use the familiar language of non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the effective potential to order @xmath56 in the derivative expansion can be expressed in the form  @xcite    @xmath57^{\\bar\\nu } c_{\\bar\\nu } \\label{eq : chiralexp}\\ ] ]    where the sum here is over all possible terms extracted from ( [ eq : lag ] ) and @xmath41 is the scale of the physics integrated out , taken to be @xmath13 in the present context .",
    "equation ( [ eq : chiralexp ] ) is intended to be symbolic ; @xmath58 indicates that either of these quantities may appear in the expansion , in any combination consistent with symmetry , with only their total power constrained .",

    "it is assumed that the coefficients @xmath64 are natural ; that is , of order unity . the fundamental assumption underlying effective field theory for the @xmath0 interaction is that this expansion in the potential , or equivalently that in the lagrangian , may be sensibly truncated at some finite order , @xmath56 . it is the purpose of this paper to test this assumption .",
    "the physical scattering amplitude is obtained by iterating the potential ( [ eq : chiralexp ] ) using the lippmann - schwinger equation    @xmath65    which generates the @xmath66-matrix .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . by assumption ,",
    "truncating the expansion ( [ eq : chiralexp ] ) and retaining only its first few terms will be valid only for nucleon momenta well below @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that a method of regularizing the otherwise - divergent integrals which occur when potentials such as ( [ eq : chiralexp ] ) are inserted into the ls equation must be specified .",

    "as we have seen , _ a priori _ there are two sources of short - distance physics in the effective field theory calculation : operators in the effective lagrangian of increasing dimensionality whose coefficients encode information about short - distance physics , and the effects of virtual particle excitations within loop graphs . in ordinary perturbative eft calculations the existence of a consistent power - counting scheme in the s - matrix relies on removing the short - distance physics that arises in loop graphs via the renormalization procedure  @xcite . since the short - distance physics is removed in a manner insensitive to choice of regularization scheme it is economical to use dr to regularize and renormalize , because dr respects chiral and gauge symmetries . when considering the relevance of eft methods in nuclear physics one might choose to extrapolate intuition gained from perturbation theory and regulate using dr .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the use of dr implicitly _ assumes _ that eft can work only if the short - distance physics buried in loop graphs _ does not _ contribute to low - energy physics .",
    "of course there is no need to make this assumption , cutoff regularization is the most physically - transparent method of regularization and keeps track of all sources of short - distance physics in the calculation .    in this section",
    "we compare dr and cutoff schemes .",
    "there are two fundamental points we wish to make : ( i ) dr and cutoff regularization do not lead to the same physical scattering amplitude .",
    "therefore in the nonperturbative context of @xmath0 scattering , short - distance physics from loops is important , in contrast to the situation in perturbative calculations ; ( ii ) when low - lying ( quasi-)bound states are present , a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a workable eft treatment of @xmath0 scattering is that short - distance effects from loops contribute to the physical scattering amplitude .",
    "we now use dimensional regularization ( dr ) to regulate the integrals @xmath95 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 which appear in the expression for @xmath109 above . as discussed above",
    ", dr is a convenient way to implement the idea that is central to the success of perturbative eft : the power - law divergent pieces of integrals over internal loop momenta should not affect the final physical scattering amplitude .",
    "if this holds true then dr should lead to the amplitude found using cutoff regularization . in dr all power - law divergences vanish , therefore @xmath110 .",

    "et al . _",
    "the renormalized scattering amplitude is not the same as that obtained using cutoff regularization .",
    "therefore the amplitude calculated using the second - order eft potential is not independent of regularization scheme , and so the scattering amplitude must be sensitive to the short - distance physics from loops .",
    "this raises the question of whether the eft treatment based on potentials has really managed to separate the long - distance physics from the short - distance physics .",
    "this separation is a precondition for the successful application of eft ideas .",
    "clearly the dr amplitude maps to the effective - range expansion only for momenta @xmath112 .",

    "( [ eq : tdr ] ) and ( [ eq : cutoff2 ] ) will agree within the domain of validity of the eft , @xmath113 .",
    "the effective theory is then perturbative .",
    "however , if the scattering length is unnaturally large the momentum domain within which the two forms are equivalent becomes small .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ eq : tdr ] ) reproduces the data in the @xmath10 extremely poorly , since it only agrees with the phenomenologically efficacious amplitude ( [ eq : reamp ] ) for very small @xmath29 .",
    "it was argued elsewhere that this failure implies that the effective theory calculation is not valid in the presence of a large scattering length  @xcite .",
    "however , this failure of dimensional regularization is no surprise when one considers the simple model of the effective - range expansion discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - sm ] .",
    "there it was clear that an unnaturally large scattering length occurs through the cancellation between two terms in the scattering amplitude , one of which arises from integration over loop momenta .",
    "this cancellation between `` range '' and `` strength '' is a general feature whenever one solves the schrdinger equation with some finite - range potential . by its very nature , dr _",
    "can not _ give a scattering amplitude that feels this cancellation , since it discards all short - distance physics that comes from loops .",
    "in fact , since there are no logarithmic divergences in this problem and the loop graphs have no finite real part , it is straightforward to show that dr gives an amplitude in which only the absorptive parts of the loop graphs are retained  .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . )",
    "hence when there are low - lying bound states the bound - state energy sets the scale of the coefficients in the potential of the dimensional regularization calculation .",
    "but recall that this was precisely the problem that iterating the potential via the ls equation was supposed to avoid .",
    "thus the implementation of the general cancellation between range and strength must be an element of any eft description of @xmath0 scattering .    in general , information about the range of the potential enters through these power - law divergences , and dr s neglect of all power - law divergences means it discards this information on the range of the interaction .",
    "this is no accident , dr is designed to be a scale - independent regularization scheme .",
    "this aspect of the dr prescription allows it to violate the wigner bound and give an amplitude which has a positive effective range from an eft potential which is apparently zero range .",
    "therefore we argue that a regulator that introduces a new scale in @xmath0 scattering must be used .",
    "however , in the next section we will show that effects due to this new scale actually destroy power counting .",
    "therefore , we believe that the intuition that eft can work only if scattering amplitudes are insensitive to the short - distance physics arising from loop graphs , which is the primary motivation for using dr , is actually correct . in other words , in all circumstances in which eft is systematic dr can , and for simplicity should , be used . in the calculation of @xmath0 scattering in the presence of low - energy bound states dr fails only because the sensitivity to short - distance physics inherent in this problem means that no sensible eft can be formulated for this problem .",
    "the arguments of the previous section show that an eft approach to @xmath0 scattering will only be efficacious in the presence of low - lying ( quasi-)bound states if the short - distance physics in loop graphs contributes to the physical scattering amplitude .",
    "if a cutoff is introduced , so that we can keep track of this physics , the bound ( [ eq : wb ] ) indicates that it can not be taken to infinity .",
    "therefore , in this section we investigate the possibility of an eft for @xmath0 scattering in the presence of a finite cutoff .",
    "this physically intuitive approach has been advocated by lepage  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that one takes an underlying theory of @xmath0 interactions and introduces a ( sharp or smooth ) momentum cutoff @xmath71 representing the scale at which the first new physics becomes important .",
    "all loops now only include momenta @xmath114 .",
    "of course , one must compensate for the effects of these neglected modes .",
    "however , lepage argues that since these modes are highly virtual , one may approximate their effects by a sequence of local contact interactions .",
    "furthermore , if the cutoff @xmath71 is placed well below the mass @xmath41 of some exchanged quantum , then , for momenta @xmath115 and @xmath116 below the cutoff , the exchange of this quantum : @xmath117 may be replaced by a contact interaction , since @xmath118 . therefore the effects coming from exchanges of quanta with masses well above the cutoff scale @xmath71 may also be approximated by contact interactions . for the numerical application of these ideas to the @xmath0 problem",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "now , all that has been said in the previous paragraph still applies if we set our cutoff @xmath71 below the scale @xmath13 .",
    "then the only explicit degrees of freedom in the problem are nucleon modes with momentum @xmath119 .",
    "all higher - momentum nucleon modes _ and _ all exchanged mesons are integrated out . this cutoff effective field theory of the @xmath0 interaction is of little practical use , but can be investigated analytically in a way that raises issues of principle . the effective lagrangian is    @xmath120    where the dots signify operators with more than two derivatives . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - eft ] , in the limit that the nucleon is very heavy we can formally calculate the four - point function exactly . to do this",

    "the theta function imposes a sharp cutoff , and so all integrals ( not just the divergent ones ) will be cut off sharply at momentum @xmath71 .",
    "after renormalization the coefficients @xmath87 , @xmath88 , etc . , will , of course , depend on the cutoff scale @xmath71 , as well as physical scales in the problem .",
    "of course , the expression ( [ eq : veffexp ] ) is an infinite series , and for practical computation some method of truncating it must be found .",
    "the fundamental philosophy of cutoff eft provides a rationale for this as follows .",
    "if we work to any finite order in the effective potential , cutoff - dependent terms in the scattering amplitude will appear .",
    "these must be in correspondence with neglected higher - order operators in @xmath27 .",
    "if such terms are progressively added to @xmath27 , one may remove the cutoff dependence order - by - order .",
    "below we will see that one can indeed define such a `` systematic '' procedure in this problem .",
    "however , _ in order that it really make sense to truncate the effective potential ( [ eq : veffexp ] ) at some finite order it must be that the operators that are neglected are in some sense small . _    naively one would expect that a sufficient condition for the operator with @xmath7 derivatives to be a small correction to the overall potential is :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is the momentum operator .",
    "this operator yields some characteristic momentum in the problem .",
    "now , in perturbation theory the short - distance physics can be removed from loops via renormalization , thereby achieving a clean separation of scales , and so the characteristic momentum is simply the external momentum . thus , in perturbative calculations the operator hierarchy ( [ eq : pcondn ] ) can be maintained , as long as one restricts oneself to small enough external momenta .",
    "however , in a nonperturbative context we have already seen that physics from loops must enter into the calculation if low - lying ( quasi-)bound states are to be generated .",

    "in fact , if this were not the case there would be no consistent power counting in these theories .",
    "by contrast , when the second - order eft potential is iterated to all orders , we find that the resulting scattering amplitude is inevitably regularization scheme dependent : dimensional regularization and cutoff regularization give different renormalized scattering amplitudes .",
    "we are therefore forced to conclude that the physical scattering amplitude is sensitive to the power - law divergences arising from loop integrations .",
    "one way to understand this sensitivity is to realize that when cutoff regularization is used the potential acquires a range , which is naively @xmath73 . when the schrdinger equation is solved all physical observables depend on the upper limit in internal loop integrations , @xmath71 . in any perturbative calculation",
    "this dependence can be removed by the introduction of a finite number of higher - dimensional operators in the lagrangian . however , for some observables , e.g. the effective range , this can not be achieved for arbitrary cutoff in our non - perturbative calculation : these observables still depend on the cutoff ( equivalently , on the `` range '' of the potential ) , even after renormalization , as evidenced by the bound ( [ eq : wb ] ) .",
    "when dimensional regularization discards all power - law divergences in order to maintain its scale independence it removes , by fiat , the power - law divergences which represent an important part of the physics of the range of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "this suggests dr should not be used to regularize this potential .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if dr is used to regularize a potential which generates low - energy bound or quasi - bound states , the resulting coefficients in the dimensionally regularized potential will be governed by the bound - state energy , and not by the underlying scale of the eft  @xcite .",

    "_ we therefore conclude that there is no small parameter which allows one to consistently truncate the regularized @xmath0 potential at some finite order in the derivative expansion . _    the preceding argument that power counting fails might be regarded as incomplete since we have demonstrated a violation of power counting at the level of the bare parameters in the regularized potential",

    "this quantity is certainly well defined . however , as discussed elsewhere in this paper , the entire reason for doing eft at the level of the potential is that we are interested in developing an eft in the vicinity of the low - energy pole , and power counting in @xmath66 or @xmath191 fails in the presence of this pole .",

    "they define systematicity to mean that the scattering length @xmath33 should receive no contribution from the term with two derivatives in the effective lagrangian ( the coefficient @xmath88 ) . since @xmath33 does receive a contribution from this term ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cbeta ] ) ) they claim that the eft ( [ eq : lag ] ) is not systematic .",
    "this definition of systematicity is patterned on perturbative eft , and may be unduly rigid .",
    "we would argue that the appearance of @xmath88 in @xmath33 does not of itself imply non - systematicity .",
    "after all , the contribution of @xmath88 to @xmath33 might be systematically small .",
    "this happens , for instance , if a finite cutoff @xmath163 is used to regularize the divergences and the physical observables are all natural .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of interest here , where @xmath49 is unnaturally large , we saw in the previous section that the contribution of the appropriately - rescaled @xmath88 to @xmath33 _ is _ of order one .",
    "the coefficients @xmath87 that are obtained in the zeroth and second - order calculations then differ significantly .",
    "perhaps this is only symptomatic of the more general malaise already diagnosed : the higher - order terms in the effective action can not be safely ignored . in summary , the appearance of higher - order coefficients in the expression for low - momentum observables does not necessarily imply non - systematicity .",
    "but here we expect the contribution of these higher - order operators to low - momentum observables to be large , because the effective potential can not be systematically truncated .",
    "the potential of eft for the @xmath0 interaction lies partly in embedding the @xmath0 scattering amplitude derived in the eft in scattering processes involving three or more nucleons . one would hope to apply power - counting arguments to determine those contributions that are important in the nuclear force and those that are systematically suppressed . in principle , this approach has predictive power . for example , as noted by weinberg , in a nucleus three - body forces",
    "are characteristically down by two powers of @xmath193 compared to two - body forces , and so might be expected to yield small contributions to nuclear observables .",
    "furthermore , four - body forces are down by four powers of @xmath193 and thus could be expected to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that at some reasonably crude level one might simply neglect @xmath194-body force effects , @xmath195 in nuclei .",
    "an analysis of realistic phenomenological nuclear force calculations  @xcite and the relative contributions of @xmath194-body forces to nuclear binding energies shows qualitative agreement with this prediction .",
    "unfortunately , in light of the results of this paper one must question in what sense it is valid to use power counting to deduce a hierarchy of @xmath194-body forces .",
    "if eft power counting is a valid way to deduce that certain terms in the hamiltonian are suppressed then we would have seen that higher - derivative terms in the potential were negligible .",
    "in fact , in none of the regularization schemes discussed here was this the case .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that effective field theory continues to be the most promising method of systematizing nuclear physics .",
    "what we have found here is that an eft for @xmath0 scattering with only nucleons must contain _ all _ operators in the effective action , and therefore is not useful .",
    "this has a simple physical interpretation . the @xmath0 scattering amplitude is sensitive to all operators in the effective action because it has a singularity corresponding to the ( quasi-)bound state pole . by definition ,",
    "this pole `` feels '' all distance scales and therefore naturally requires that operators to all orders in momentum in the effective action be present in order to describe it .",
    "the only way around this dilemma is to include the ( quasi-)bound state pole as a `` fundamental '' degree of freedom in the effective theory , while retaining the four - point @xmath0 interactions of the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag ] )  @xcite . in the resulting eft",
    ", these @xmath0 contact interactions can be treated perturbatively with consistent power counting .",
    "application of these ideas in the three - nucleon scattering problem is being pursued in ref .",
