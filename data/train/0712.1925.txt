    "the study of @xmath0 hypernuclei has a long and impressive history , with the shell structure mapped out across the periodic table  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the single particle spin - orbit force is very small  @xcite and systematic studies of the energy levels of light @xmath0 hypernuclei have enabled the extraction of considerable detail concerning the effective @xmath0-n interaction .",
    "current studies of electroproduction at jlab will provide important new information in this area  @xcite .",
    "when one turns to @xmath2 and @xmath1 hypernuclei , the situation is quite different . the special case of @xmath3he aside",
    ", there is no experimental evidence for any @xmath2 hypernuclei  @xcite , despite extensive searches .",
    "indeed , it seems likely that the @xmath2-nucleus interaction is somewhat repulsive and that there are no bound @xmath2 hypernuclei beyond a=4 . in the case of the @xmath1 , the experimental situation is very challenging , with just a handful of observations of doubly strange nuclei .",
    "while we eagerly await studies of @xmath1 hypernuclei with new facilities at j - parc and gsi - fair , it seems likely that these hypernuclei may exist  @xcite and it would be helpful to have a range of predictions from various theoretical models .",
    "there is currently considerable interest in the equation of state of dense nuclear matter , especially in connection with the calculation of neutron star properties  @xcite .",
    "the density at which hyperons appear and particularly their order , plays a crucial role in the equation of state ( eos )  for example , the inclusion of hyperons in the qmc model seems essential if the direct urca process is to play a role in cooling for observed neutron stars  @xcite . for matter in @xmath4-equilibrium ,",
    "negatively charged hyperons are favoured a priori and in many models @xmath5 hyperons enter soon after the @xmath0 .",
    "other models suggest that the @xmath6 should appear after the @xmath0 ( followed by the @xmath7 ) , with the @xmath2 playing no role .",
    "whichever scenario is ultimately correct , hyperon physics will play a critical role at 2  3 @xmath8 and a relativistic treatment is essential  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we apply the latest development of the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite to calculate the properties of hypernuclei .",
    "the major improvement in the model that we use here is the inclusion of the effect of the medium on the hyperfine interaction .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the splitting between the @xmath0 and @xmath2 masses as the density rises .",
    "this is the prime reason why we find that @xmath2 hypernuclei are unbound . on the other hand",
    ", the model produces quite good binding energies for @xmath0 hypernuclei and predicts modest binding of @xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "the qmc model was created to provide insight into the structure of nuclear matter , starting at the quark level  @xcite .",
    "nucleon internal structure was modeled using the mit bag , while the binding was described by the self - consistent coupling of the confined quarks to @xmath9 and @xmath10 meson fields generated by the confined quarks in the other `` nucleons '' in the medium .",
    "while the use of effective scalar and vector fields to carry the forces is very similar to qhd , the explicit treatment of the n internal structure represents an important departure from that classical approach .",
    "the self - consistent response of the bound quarks to the mean @xmath9 field leads to a novel saturation mechanism for nuclear matter , with the enhancement of the lower components of the valence dirac wave functions , as the density increases , reducing the effective @xmath9-n coupling .",
    "this effect is naturally represented by a single new parameter , @xmath11 , the scalar polarizability , with the nucleon effective mass taking the form : m_n^ * = m_n - g_n + ( g_n ) ^2 .",
    "[ eq : effmass ] the qmc model has been used to study the binding of @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 nuclei  @xcite , as well as the effect of the medium on @xmath15 and @xmath16 production  @xcite .",
    "it leads to a very natural explanation of the small spin orbit force in @xmath0 hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "a recent extension of the same physical ideas to a confining version of the njl model  @xcite has led to a quantitative description of the emc effect across the periodic table , with a remarkable prediction of a sizeable enhancement of the nuclear modification of spin structure functions  @xcite .    for the present purpose ,",
    "the most significant recent development is the inclusion of the self - consistent effect of the mean scalar field on the familiar one - gluon - exchange hyperfine interaction that in free space leads to the n-@xmath17 and @xmath2-@xmath0 mass splitting  @xcite .",
    "the original qmc model treated this term as a small correction and ignored its medium modification .",
    "however , the term `` hyperfine '' is misleading , as the n-@xmath17 splitting is 30% of the nucleon mass .",
    "one - gluon - exchange in the bag model is essentially determined by the magnetic moments of the confined quarks  @xcite and , in first approximation , the hyperfine splitting is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant , essentially independent of the quark masses , and @xmath20 are , respectively , the magnetic moments of the confined light and strange quarks . from the experimental value in free space @xmath21 we get @xmath22 .",
    "this decrease of the magnetic moment with the increase of the quark mass is a relativistic effect similar in nature to the saturation mechanism of the qmc model . in the medium",
    "the light quark interacts with the nuclear @xmath9 field and this amounts to decreasing its mass .",
    "this in turn reduces its eigenenergy ( which is roughly the equivalent of the constituent quark mass ) and as a result the magnetic moment of the light quarks in medium changes to @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "an explicit calculation predicts @xmath25 at nuclear matter density .",
    "assuming that the strange quark is not coupled to the nuclear field one thus finds that the relative change of @xmath26 , because of the @xmath9 field , is @xmath27}{\\mu_0-\\mu_s}\\sim 1 + 3.5\\epsilon \\ , , \\ ] ] where we have used @xmath22 .",
    "this rough calculation thus implies that the @xmath2 will be less bound than the @xmath28 by @xmath29 , which is consistent with the exact calculation described below .",
    "our motivation for applying the model to finite hypernuclei is that this effect has the right sign to help solve the major problem found in the original qmc model , namely that @xmath2 hypernuclei were not much less bound than @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    ".octet and decuplet masses in gev .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 and the strange mass @xmath31 are fitted to the @xmath32 masses .",
    "the last three columns are predictions for the decuplet masses .",
    "[ newbag ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our results are presented in tables  [ spe1 ] and [ spep2 ] . the overall agreement with the experimental energy levels of @xmath0 hypernuclei across the periodic table is quite good .",
    "the discrepancies which remain may well be resolved by small effective hyperon - nucleon interactions which go beyond the simple , single - particle shell model .",
    "once again , we stress the very small spin - orbit force experienced by the @xmath0 , which is a natural property of the qmc model  @xcite .",
    "there are no entries for the @xmath2-hyperon because neither the @xmath33 nor the @xmath34 is bound to a finite nucleus .",
    "this absence of bound @xmath2-hypernuclei constitutes a major advance over earlier work .",
    "we stress that this is a direct consequence of the enhancement of the hyperfine interaction ( that splits the masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 hyperons ) by the mean scalar field in - medium .",
    "it is especially interesting to examine the effective non - relativistic potential felt by the @xmath34 in a finite nucleus .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : pot ] for calcium and lead . in the central region",
    "the vector interaction dominates over the scalar one leading to a repulsive effective potential which reaches respectively 30 mev and 12 mev at the center .",
    "it is only at the surface that the scalar attraction becomes dominant .",
    "while the exact numerical values depend on the mass taken for the @xmath9 meson , we stress the similarity to the phenomenological form found by batty _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . for a recent review",
    ". it will clearly be very interesting to pursue the application of the current theoretical formulation to @xmath5-atoms .",
    "we also note that this model supports the existence of a variety of bound @xmath1-hypernuclei . for the @xmath7 the binding of the 1s level varies from 5 mev in @xmath35o to 15 mev in @xmath36pb . the experimental search for such states at facilities such as j - parc and",
    "gsi - fair will be very important .",
    "the effective potential for @xmath37 in calcium and lead , width=340 ]",
    "in conclusion , we stress that including the effect of the medium on the hyperfine interaction between quarks within the quark - meson coupling model has led to some important advances .",
    "the agreement between the parameter free calculations and the experimental ground state levels for @xmath0-hypernuclei from calcium to lead is impressive . in oxygen",
    "the agreement is not as good and we take it as a reminder that the qmc model may be better at describing heavy nuclei , for which the constant density region dominates over the surface . for the d- and f - wave levels shown in table iii",
    ", there is a tendency for the model to overbind by several mev .",
    "whether this is a consequence of the use of an extreme single particle shell model for the core , the omission of residual @xmath38 interactions or an aspect of the current implementation of qmc that requires improvement remains to be seen .",
    "nevertheless , we find these initial results , obtained with no adjustment of parameters to hyperon data , very encouraging .",
    "a number of @xmath1-hypernuclei are predicted to be bound , although not as deeply as in the @xmath0 case . on the other hand",
    ", the additional repulsion arising from the enhancement of the hyperfine reulsion in the @xmath2-hyperon in - medium , together with the effect of the @xmath39 channel coupling on the intermediate range scalar attraction , means that no @xmath2-hypernuclei are predicted to be bound .",
    "this encouraging picture of finite hypernuclei , suggests that the underlying model , which is fully relativistic and incorporates the quark substructure of the baryons , is ideally suited for application to the properties of dense matter and neutron stars .",
