    "the scaling behavior of directed percolation is recognized as the paradigm of the critical behavior of several non - equilibrium systems which exhibits a continuous phase transition from an active state to an absorbing non - active state ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "the widespread occurrence of such systems in physics , biology , as well as catalytic chemical reactions is reflected by the well known universality hypothesis of janssen and grassberger that models which exhibit a continuous phase transition to a single absorbing state generally belong to the universality class of directed percolation  @xcite . introducing additional symmetries",
    "the critical behavior differs from directed percolation .",
    "in particular particle conservation leads to the different universality class of absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field as pointed out in  @xcite . in that work the authors introduced two models , the conserved lattice gas ( clg ) and the conserved threshold transfer process ( cttp ) .",
    "the latter one is a conserved modification of the threshold transfer process introduced in  @xcite .",
    "both models display a continuous phase transition from an active to an inactive phase and are believed to belong to the same universality class  @xcite .",
    "the steady - state scaling behavior of the clg model was investigated recently .",
    "the order parameter and its fluctuations were numerically examined in  @xcite .",
    "the scaling behavior in an external field conjugated to the order parameter was considered in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore a modified clg model was introduced which allows to determine analytically the steady - state mean - field scaling behavior of the universality class  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the scaling behavior of the cttp was investigated in low dimensional ( @xmath0 ) systems only  @xcite and no external field was applied .",
    "therefore we consider in this work the cttp with and without an external field in various dimensions  ( @xmath1 ) and determine a set of critical exponents .",
    "all obtained results coincides with those of the clg model , strongly supporting the universality hypothesis of  @xcite .",
    "in this work we consider the cttp on simple cubic lattices of linear size  @xmath2 in various dimensions with  @xmath3 particles .",
    "the lattice sites may be empty , occupied by one particle , or occupied by two particles .",
    "empty and single occupied sites are considered as non - active whereas double occupied lattice sites are considered as active . in the latter case one tries to transfer both particles of each active site to randomly chosen empty or single occupied nearest neighbor sites .",
    "if no active sites exist the system is trapped forever in a certain configuration , a so - called absorbing state .    in the following",
    "we denote the densities of active sites with @xmath4 and the density of particles on the lattice as @xmath5 , which is considered as the control parameter of the absorbing phase transition .",
    "the density of active sites @xmath4 is the order parameter of the absorbing phase transition , i.e. , it vanishes at the critical density @xmath6 according to @xmath7 with the reduced control parameter @xmath8 and the order parameter exponent  @xmath9 .",
    "similar to equilibrium phase transitions it is possible in the case of absorbing phase transitions to apply an external field  @xmath10 which is conjugated to the order parameter ( see for instance  @xcite ) . as usually for continuous phase transitions the conjugated field has to destroy the disordered phase and",
    "the associated linear response function @xmath11 has to diverge at the critical point ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) . in the case of an absorbing phase transition the external field acts as a spontaneous creation of active particles ,",
    "i.e. , the external field destroys the absorbing state and thus the phase transition itself . but considering absorbing phase transitions with particle conversation one has to take care that the external field does not change the particle number .",
    "a possible realization of the external field was developed in  @xcite where the external field triggers movements of inactive particles which may be activated in this way .",
    "the external field  @xmath10 is another relevant scaling field and for sufficiently small values of  @xmath10 the order parameter scales as @xmath14 with the critical field exponent @xmath15 and the scaling function  @xmath16 .",

    "that an external field is applied the active particle creation is performed after each update step in order to mimic the external field . after a certain relaxation time the system reaches a steady state where the density of active sites at update step @xmath20 fluctuates around the average value @xmath21 which is interpreted as the order parameter @xmath22 ( see for instance figs.1 of  @xcite ) .    additionally to the order parameter we consider its fluctuations @xmath23 .",

    "we assume that the fluctuations obey the scaling ansatz @xmath28 setting @xmath29 one recovers eq.([eq : fluc_crit ] ) for @xmath13 .",
