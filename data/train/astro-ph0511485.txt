    "the _ r_-modes are non - radial pulsations modes of rotating stars that have the coriolis force as their restoring force and a characteristic frequency comparable to the rotation speed of the star @xcite .",
    "these modes are driven unstable by gravitational radiation in all rotating stars @xcite",
    ". a deeper understanding of @xmath1-modes and their astrophysical relevance requires taking into account nonlinear effects in the evolution of the @xmath1-mode instability .",
    "one such a nonlinear effect , differential rotation induced by @xmath1-modes , has been studied by several authors .",
    "rezzolla , lamb and shapiro @xcite were the first to suggest that differential rotation drifts of kinematical nature could be induced by @xmath1-modes , deriving an approximate analytical expression for this differential rotation .",
    "afterwards , the existence of such drifts was confirmed numerically both in general relativistic @xcite and newtonian hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , an exact @xmath1-mode solution , describing differential rotation of pure kinematic nature that produces large scale drifts along stellar latitudes , was found within the nonlinear theory up to second order in the mode s amplitude @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the role of differential rotation in the evolution of the @xmath0 _ r_-mode instability of a newly born , hot , rapidly - rotating neutron star .",
    "a few years ago , owen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a simple model to study the evolution of the @xmath1-mode instability in newly born , hot , rapidly - rotating neutron stars . within this model",
    ", it is assumed that the time evolution of the system ( star and @xmath1-mode perturbation ) is characterized by two parameters : the angular velocity of the star , @xmath2 , and the amplitude of the mode , @xmath3 .",
    "the total angular momentum of the star is then given by @xmath4 where the momentum of inertia @xmath5 of the equilibrium configuration is @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , and the canonical angular momentum @xmath8 of the _",
    "r_-mode perturbation is @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . here ,",
    "only the @xmath0 @xmath1-mode is being considered and it is assumed that the mass density @xmath11 and the pressure @xmath12 of the fluid are related by a polytropic equation of state @xmath13 , with @xmath14 such that the mass and radius of the star take the values @xmath15 and @xmath16 km , respectively .    within this model",
    "it is also assumed that the total angular momentum of the star decreases due to the emission of gravitational radiation and that the physical energy of the @xmath1-mode perturbation ( in the co - rotating frame ) increases due to the emission of gravitational radiation and decreases due to the dissipative effect of viscosity .",
    "these assumptions lead then to a system of differential equations for the angular momentum of the star , @xmath17 , and the amplitude of the @xmath1-mode , @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , the gravitational - radiation and viscous timescales , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are given by @xcite @xmath23 in the above expressions , the fiducial timescales are @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    for a newly born , hot",
    ", rapidly - rotating neutron star there is an interval of relevant temperatures and angular velocities of the star for which the gravitational timescale is much smaller than the viscous timescale , @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , for this interval of temperatures and angular velocities , we can neglect in the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ omega ] ) and ( [ alfa ] ) the terms proportional to @xmath28 and obtain the solution @xmath29 and @xmath30 . if the initial angular velocity is chosen to be @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the keplerian angular velocity at which the star starts shedding mass at the equator , then @xmath33 , implying that the perturbation grows exponentially from an initial amplitude @xmath34 to values of order unity in just about @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "after this first stage of evolution of the @xmath1-mode instability , the amplitude @xmath18 has to be forced , by hand , to take a certain saturation value @xmath36 ; in the second stage of the evolution it is then assumed that @xmath37 and @xmath17 is determined from the equation @xmath38 which yields the solution @xmath39}^{-1/6 } , \\label{omega - k54}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the time at which occurs the transition from the first to the second stage of evolution . during the second stage of evolution , the star loses its angular momentum , spinning down to its final angular velocity . as can be seen from the above equations , the final angular velocity of the star depends critically on the saturation value of the mode s amplitude @xmath41 ; for instance ,",
    "after one year of evolution , for @xmath31 and @xmath42 one obtains @xmath43 , while for @xmath44 the angular velocity is @xmath45 .",
    "the fact that the growth of the mode s amplitude has to be stopped by hand at a certain saturation value introduces an element of arbitrariness into the solution , permitting , for instance , that agreement between the predicted final value of the angular velocity of the star and the value inferred from astronomical observations can always be achieved by fine - tuning the value of the saturation amplitude .",
    "as will be seen in the next section , this arbitrariness disappears when differential rotation is taken into account .",
    "differential rotation induced by @xmath1-modes _ does _ contribute to the physical angular momentum of the _",
    "r_-mode perturbation @xcite .",
    "therefore , a model for the evolution of the _ r_-mode instability should include the effect of differential rotation . here , we adopt the model of owen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , described in the previous section , with the important difference that the total angular momentum of the star is given by @xmath46 where the physical angular momentum of the _",
    "r_-mode perturbation @xmath47 is @xcite @xmath48 in the previous expression , @xmath49 is a constant fixed by the choice of initial data and gives the initial amount of differential rotation associated with the _ r_-mode .",
    "the specific case @xmath50 , for which the physical angular momentum of the _",
    "r_-mode perturbation coincides with the canonical angular momentum , corresponds to the model of owen _ et al .",
    "@xcite described in great detail in the previous section .",
    "there is not , to our knowledge , any physical condition that forces @xmath49 to take such a particular value @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we will consider in this paper arbitrary values of @xmath49 in the interval @xmath51 .",
    "results from the fact that one wishes to impose the condition that @xmath52 ( the initial amplitude @xmath53 is considered throughout the paper to be @xmath54 ) .",
    "the lower limit for @xmath49 results from the fact that we do not want to saturate the amplitude of the mode by hand , a procedure needed for the case @xmath55 in order to avoid that the total angular momentum of the star becomes negative . ]",
    "following the procedure described in the previous section , we arrive at a system of two first - order coupled differential equations determining the time evolution of the amplitude of the _ r_-mode @xmath3 and of the angular velocity of the star @xmath2 : @xmath56 \\frac{\\alpha}{\\tau_{gr } } , \\label{alfa-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] valid when the damping effect of viscosity can be neglected relatively to the driving effect of gravitational radiation .",
    "this system of equations was solved analytically and discussed in great detail in ref .  [ 9 ] . in the initial stages of the evolution of the _ r_-mode instability @xmath18 increases exponentially @xcite , @xmath57 while for later times",

    "r_-modes is significant , then the saturation amplitude @xmath41 can be as small as @xmath63 .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the time evolution of the angular velocity of the star , @xmath17 . in the initial stages of the evolution of the _ r_-mode instability @xmath17 decreases as @xcite @xmath64 while for later times @xmath17 decreases slowly as @xmath65 the smooth transition between the regimes ( [ i - fase ] ) and ( [ f - fase ] ) occurs for @xmath59 seconds ( see fig .",

    "this contrasts with the results obtained in ref .  [ 7 ] , where the value of @xmath17 depends critically on the choice of @xmath41 .",
    "after about one year of evolution , when the dissipative effect of viscosity becomes dominant and starts damping the mode , the angular velocity of the star becomes @xmath66 ( for @xmath31 ) , in good agreement with the inferred initial angular velocity of the fastest pulsars associated with supernova remnants .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the role of differential rotation in the evolution of the @xmath0 _ r_-mode instability of a newly born , hot , rapidly - rotating neutron star .",
    "we have shown that , a few hundred seconds after the mode instability sets in , the amplitude of the _ r_-mode saturates in a natural way at values that depend on the initial amount of differential rotation associated to the @xmath1-mode .",
