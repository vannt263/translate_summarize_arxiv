    "event shapes belong to the most widely used variables to study qcd dynamics , especially at @xmath0 and @xmath1 colliders .",
    "event - shape observables are defined in terms of the four - momenta of jets in the final state . recently a large set of new hadronic event - shape variables has been proposed in ref .",
    "an important aspect of these variables is their normalization to the total transverse momentum or energy in the event .",
    "therefore it is anticipated that energy scale uncertainties should cancel out to a large extent .",
    "thus we believe that they represent an useful tool for very early measurements of the properties of qcd events at lhc and the tuning of monte carlo models .",
    "analogously to the @xmath0 event shapes , one can define hadronic event shapes in the transverse plane , for example the central transverse thrust : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the transverse momenta with respect to the beam axis @xmath4 .",
    "the transverse axis , for which the maximum is obtained , is the thrust axis @xmath5 .",
    "the variable which is typically used for perturbative calculations is @xmath6 .",
    "the central thrust minor is a measure for the out - of - plane momentum : @xmath7    below the results of a first simulation study @xcite of these event - shapes variables at the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) are summarized .",
    "@xmath8 is used to simulate proton - proton collisions with a centre of mass energy @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the events have been passed through a full geant based simulation of the cms detector .",
    "events are preselected by requiring two or more calorimeter jets , corrected in their relative and absolute response , with a transverse energy @xmath10 within a region of @xmath11 .",
    "if the two hardest jets of the event are not in this central region , the event is rejected .",
    "only central corrected calorimeter jets with @xmath10 are used for the event - shape calculation .",
    "the threshold on the transverse energy of the leading jet is set at @xmath12 .",
    "[ sec : corrections ]    the effect of jet energy corrections on the normalized event - shape distributions can be judged by comparing the corrected and uncorrected distributions with the corresponding generator level distribution .",
    "a threshold of 30 @xmath13 on the transverse energy of uncorrected jets is applied , which corresponds to a generator level jet threshold of approximately 60 @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , the threshold on the uncorrected leading jets is @xmath14 .",
    "all three distributions agree well with deviations within 5 - 7 % over most of the range as fig  [ fig : l2l3_thrust ] illustrates .",
    "[ fig : l2l3_thrust ]    often , the leading source of systematic errors in qcd data analysis is the limited knowledge of the jet energy scale ( jes ) and , to a lesser extent , the jet energy resolution . by definition",
    ", event - shape variables are expected to be rather robust against both sources of systematic errors .",
    "we assume a global uncertainty of 10% on the knowledge of the jet energy scale .",
    "the resulting normalized event - shape distributions deviate by 5 - 10% from the reference distribution over the whole energy range as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : calo_thrust ] .",
    "the effect of the jet energy resolution is studied by applying the jet energy resolution smearing function [ eq : smear_ass ] on generator level jets : @xmath15            the smeared event - shape distributions deviate by less than @xmath16 from the unsmeared distribution over most of the energy range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smear ] ) .",
    "in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of hadronic event - shape distributions to different models of multi - jet production , we compare the central transverse thrust and thrust minor distributions to the generator level predictions as obtained from two generators that contain different models of qcd multi - jet production , @xmath8 and @xmath17 @xcite . the @xmath18 samples used in our study contains qcd processes from 2 up to 6 jets . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alp_pyt_trthr ] the distributions of the central transverse thrust and central thrust minor can be seen .",
    "these events are selected from a jet trigger , based on the calibrated transverse energy of the hardest jet @xmath19 with a prescale of 100 .",
    "the error bars on the data points include the statistical uncertainties corresponding to @xmath20 of integrated luminosity and the systematic errors due to jet energy scale and jet energy resolution as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the corrected calorimeter jets correspond to the samples , and they are found to be compatible with the generator level jets from . it can be seen that there is a significant difference with respect to the distribution , reflecting the different underlying matrix element calculations in the generators and the different parameter choices .",
    "the result shows that hadronic event shapes can be powerful handles in comparing and tuning different models of multi - jet production .     with the statistical and dominant systematic errors expected after @xmath20 of integrated luminosity .",
