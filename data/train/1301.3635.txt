    "deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) combines the features of inelastic processes with those of an elastic one .",
    "it has been realized @xcite that a straightforward generalization of the ordinary parton densities arises in exclusive two - photon processes in the bjorken region , e.g. in compton scattering with a highly virtual incoming photon , and in hard photoproduction of mesons .",
    "generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) combine our knowledge about the one - dimensional parton distribution in the longitudinal momentum with the impact - parameter , or transverse distribution of matter in a hadron or nucleus@xcite .",
    "gpd can not be measured directly , instead they appear as convolution integrals of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is called skewness and @xmath7 is the average longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck parton in the initial and final states .",
    "this integral corresponds to deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) in the `` hand - bag '' approximation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : handbag ] a ) , and @xmath7 is the integration variable , not to be confused with the bjorken variable @xmath8 .",
    "( [ convolut ] ) is an integral equation for the unknown function gpd . the solution is well known along the cross - over line @xmath9 , where ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath10        gpd ( the nominator in eq .",
    "( [ convolut ] ) ) is assumed to be universal for all exclusive processes of the type @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for a real photon or vector meson , the dependence on the processes coming from the `` handle '' , calculable perturbatively .",
    "if so , many different processes of exclusive vector particle production can be described , according to eq .",
    "( [ convolut ] ) , by a universal gpd with different integration kernels , see fig .",
    "[ fig : handbag ] b ) .",
    "since the gpd is not known apriori , one seeks for models of gpd ( see e.g. @xcite ) based on general constraints on its analytic and asymptotic behavior .",
    "the calculated scattering amplitudes ( cross sections ) are than compared with the data to confirm , modify or reject the chosen form of the gpd .",
    "in this paper we use two explicit models of dvcs and vector meson production ( vmp ) to obtain exact analytic expressions for gpd . to this end",
    "we propose a method of deconvolution of integral equations with a singular kernel of the cauchy type to enable to go beyond the crossover trajectory and explore the hitherto unknown properties of the gpd .",
    "regge pole models provide an adequate framework to describe high - energy , low @xmath13 scattering phenomena .",
    "being part of the @xmath14 matrix theory , however , strictly speaking , they are valid only for the scattering of on - mass - shall particles .",
    "still , the successful application of the regge pole models in describing the off mass - shall hera data opened the way to their use deep - inelastic scattering , dvcs and vector meson production at hera .",
    "the appearance of the `` forbidden '' @xmath15 dependence was circumvent by calling the @xmath15-dependent regge trajectories `` effective '' ones .",
    "a particularly simple and efficient regge pole model @xcite with @xmath15-dependent residues ( vertices ) will be used below to guide our deconvolution procedure .    in a more advanced regge - pole model @xcite , to be used below , the regge trajectories and the residues do not depend on virtuality .",
    "instead , the amplitude contains two ( or more ) regge - pole terms , whose relative weight depends on @xmath15 , mimicking the multi - pole nature of the so - called qcd pomeron . of great interest",
    "is the use of alternative models @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the regge pole amplitudes are complex functions , their phase being fixed by the residue function . since these model satisfy the basic properties of the theory , yet they fit the data , we shall use them to demonstrate the merits of our deconvolution procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 ( simple dvcs amplitude ) we introduce an explicit dvcs amplitude whose merit it simplicity , necessary in testing the capacity of our deconvolution procedure ; in section 3 ( deconvolution ) we describe the mathematical basis for our method ; in section 4 ( factorization ) we introduce the factorization hypothesis , essential in deriving gpd . in sections 5 ( reggeometric model of dvcs )",
    "we apply our method to a more complicated model for the amplitude .",
    "for the sake of clarity we start with a very simply but efficient model of the dvcs scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "this model accumulate in a compact way the main properties of the expected dvcs amplitude .",
    "namely , it is regge - behaved , has the required behavior in s , t and @xmath15 , yet it fits the dvcs data measured at hera by the hi and zeus collaborations .",
    "the kinematics of those data are such that they correspond to diffractive scattering , and consequently the @xmath13 channel exchange is dominated by a single pomeron trajectory .",
    "the explicit forms of the relevant scattering amplitude is @xcite :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a new variable introduced in ref . @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) we get the real and imaginary parts of the dvcs amplitude : @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 skewness is defined in terms of the bjorken variable @xmath8 as @xmath24 or v.v . , @xmath25 .    since the @xmath15 dependence in the model of ref . @xcite",
    "may not follow qcd evolution ( ambiguous in dvcs ) , we keep it fixed at some value @xmath15 that may be associated with the `` frozen '' qcd coupling constant .",

    "it is easy to see that any other function @xmath98 except ( [ goodf ] ) will violate the reality of gpd .",
    "so , this is a general solution .",
    "another simple and explicit albeit more advanced model for dvcs , as well as for vector meson production ( vmp ) was proposed recently @xcite .    here",
    "the pomeron is also unique for all reactions , but the scattering amplitude contains two terms , a `` soft '' ( @xmath99 ) and `` hard '' ( @xmath100 ) one , `` weighted '' by @xmath101-dependent pre - factors : @xmath102    in a sense , it mimics the multi(infinite)-component qcd pomeron and , in principle , is applicable to any exclusive reactions , be it `` soft '' or `` hard '' .",
    "the parameters of the model are fixed from `` first principles '' and/or from the fits to the data , see @xcite .",
    "similarly to sec . 3 , and by using the relation @xmath103 , we rewrite this amplitude in terms of the variable characteristic of gpd : @xmath104 where @xmath105    it is easy to see that our simple factorization approach is not working here any more . really , let assume factorization to be of the form @xmath106 with an arbitrary function @xmath98",

    "then we can arrange the gpd to be a real - valued function for a certain point @xmath111 , both terms in ( [ breakreality ] ) complex , their being real .",
    "however , by changing the value of @xmath7 , we break this condition , since @xmath112 can not depend on @xmath7 .",
    "we may proceed in the following way : the equation for gpd ( [ convolut ] ) is linear , so we can split our amplitude ( [ short_form_a2 ] ) in two parts and search for the solution as the sum of solutions for both parts .",

    "the resulting gpd will be the sum of ( [ solgpd_s ] ) and ( [ solgpd_h ] ) .",
    "we have suggested a method for deconvoluting general parton distributions beyond the cross - over line based on the assumed factorization properties of the gpd under the convolution integral .",
    "we test the method by using two simple , explicit regge - pole based models of the dvcs amplitude .",
    "it is important that our scattering amplitudes , due to the presence of the regge phases , are complex - valued functions .",
    "otherwise , the phase can be recovered either by dispersion relation methods or from the interference between the dvcs amplitude with bethe - heitler processes , see @xcite .",
    "we hope that this method can be applied to other models of dvcs ( or vector meson production ( vmp ) ) .",
    "comparison with alternative models of dvcs ( vmp ) and the resulting gpds is of great interest .",
    "although the models @xcite and @xcite , used in the present paper , contain some @xmath15 variation ( introdeced phenomenologically ) , its value was fixed for simplicity at some @xmath121 that can be interpreted as a fixed qcd running constant .",
