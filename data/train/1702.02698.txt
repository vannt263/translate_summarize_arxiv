    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics so far provides an excellent description of a wide variety of experimental observations , nevertheless , it must be extended because it fails at least in explaining two cosmological puzzles : it does not provide a dark matter ( dm ) candidate and it is not possible to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "the later one requires a strongly first order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) to provide a non - equilibrium environment if the bau is generated via the electroweak baryogenesis mechanism  @xcite . since the 125 gev higgs boson is too heavy to give rise to a first order ewpt  @xcite , new ingredients beyond the sm higgs interactions",
    "may be needed . on the other hand ,",
    "how dm interacts with the sm particles remains unknown .",
    "the higgs portal turns to be attractive since it may kill two birds ( dm and the strongly first order ewpt  @xcite ) with one stone .",
    "the characteristics of a scalar dm triggered strongly first order ewpt are twofold : ( i )  it is a two - step phase transition  @xcite and the barrier between electroweak symmetric and broken phases arises at the tree - level , which may avoid the problem of gauge - dependence  @xcite ; ( ii )  the parameter space of the model is strongly constrained by the exclusion limits of direct detections and can not explain the observed relic density .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that , for the sm plus a real scalar dm @xmath0 scenario , @xmath0 could only constitute up to @xmath1 of the total dm relic density , while still be relevant for the direct detection because of its sizable coupling with the sm higgs as required by the two - step ewpt .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this type of ewpt by extending the sm with a scalar singlet dm @xmath0 and another scalar singlet @xmath2 which can mix with the sm - like higgs boson . due to the mixing of @xmath2 with the sm higgs , there are two separate contributions to dm nucleon scattering , which may cancel with each other and leads to a negligible cross section .",
    "it results in a mechanism to suppress the direct detection signal and evade the currently most stringent experimental constraints from the direct detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the quartic interaction @xmath3 may contribute to the mass of @xmath0 , which can lead to a relatively small quartic coupling of @xmath0 with the sm - like higgs and result in a sizable relic density . as a result",
    "the tension between the dm relic density and direct detection which occurs for the sm plus singlet case  @xcite can be highly loosed in this scenario .",
    "for the thermal history of the universe , the presence of the two additional scalars allows a two step ewpt .",
    "this happens as follows : as the universe cools down , @xmath0 gets vacuum expectation value ( vev ) first and the universe transits to this phase ; as the temperature gets lower , a second minimum occurs in the sm - like higgs and @xmath2 subspace .",
    "the universe then tunnels to this electroweak minimum resulting in a strongly first order ewpt with gravitational waves ( gw ) generated .",
    "gw signals coming from this two - step ewpt are calculated using one benchmark point of the parameter space and our results show that the corresponding gw signals are testable in the evolved laser interferometer space antenna ( elisa ) , deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) , ultimate - decigo and big bang observer ( bbo ) .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "conventions of the model are defined in sec .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we present the model for two - step phase transition and scalar dm in this section .",
    "the model extends the sm with two real scalar singlets : @xmath0 and @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the dm candidate , while @xmath2 gets non - zero vev at the zero temperature and thus mixes with the sm higgs  .",
    "the higgs potential can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sm higgs doublet .",
    "the effective potential , critical for the ewpt , can be written as : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the tree - level potential , @xmath8 is known as the coleman - weinberg term  @xcite , @xmath9 includes finite temperature contributions from loops  @xcite and bosonic ring  @xcite .",
    "for one - step phase transition , where higgs potential contains no tree - level cubic term , the barrier between the electroweak symmetric and broken phases usually arises from loop corrections and according to the nielsen identity  @xcite , the resulting effective potential is gauge dependent .",
    "for the two step phase transition , the barrier arises at the tree - level .",
    "so we include in the effective potential the standard one - loop @xmath10 corrections , but only retain terms proportional to @xmath11 for the consideration of gauge invariance .",
    "thermal masses of scalars take the following forms : @xmath12 we require @xmath0 to have zero vev at @xmath13 for the stability of the dm and parametrize the other two fields by @xmath14 and @xmath15 with here @xmath16 and @xmath17 . minimization conditions around @xmath18 in the @xmath19 space allow us to trade the two vevs @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 by @xmath24 we also replace @xmath25 by the physical dm mass @xmath26 , @xmath27 with these substitutions , the mass matrix for @xmath28 is then given by @xmath29 which can be diagonalized by a @xmath30 orthogonal matrix parametrized by a rotation angle @xmath31 .",

    "on the other hand , we require that the global minimum at @xmath13 forbids a nonzero vev in the @xmath55 direction . as a result @xmath55 can serve as a dm candidate , which interacts with the sm particles via the higgs portal interactions .",
    "the couplings between the dm and the physical scalars are @xmath56 the relic density of the dm is governed by the boltzmann equation : @xmath57 where @xmath5 is the hubble constant , @xmath58 is the thermal average of the reduced annihilation cross section . for our model ,",
    "the dm can annihilate into @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 final states via s - channel higgs mediations , where di - scalar processes also receive contribution from four point interactions in eq .",

    "[ fig : ewpt - pattern ] . at sufficiently high temperature",
    ", the universe sits at the global minimum @xmath84 where the electroweak symmetry is restored .",
    "as temperature drops to @xmath85 , a minimum develops in the @xmath55 direction and due to an absence of a barrier with the one at the origin , the universe transits to this minimum through a second order phase transition .",
    "as @xmath81 continues decreasing to @xmath86 , a second minimum develops in the @xmath28 direction but its free energy is initially higher than the one in the @xmath55 direction .",
    "as @xmath81 further decreases , the free energy of the minimum in the @xmath28 direction drops faster than the one in the @xmath55 direction , and at the critical temperature @xmath87 , these two minima become degenerate . slightly below @xmath87 ,",
    "the universe makes a second transition to the global minimum in the @xmath28 direction . due to the existence of the barrier between these two minima ,",

    "the points are further filtered to give a relic density in the range @xmath112 with the remaining plotted using green color . at this step",
    ", these points can give a two - step ewpt and a sizable amount of relic density but the second step ewpt is not necessarily strongly first order .",

    "<S> we study in this work a scenario that the universe undergoes a two step phase transition with the first step happened to the dark matter sector and the second step being the transition between the dark matter and the electroweak vacuums , where the barrier between the two vacuums , that is necessary for a strongly first order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) as required by the electroweak baryogenesis mechanism , arises at the tree - level . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this idea by working with the standard model ( sm ) augmented by a scalar singlet dark matter and an extra scalar singlet which mixes with the sm higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> we study the conditions for such pattern of phase transition to occur and especially for the strongly first order ewpt to take place , as well as its compatibility with the basic requirements of a successful dark matter , such as observed relic density and constraints of direct detections . </S>",
    "<S> we further explore the discovery possibility of this pattern ewpt by searching for the gravitational waves generated during this process in spaced based interferometer , by showing a representative benchmark point of the parameter space that the generated gravitational waves fall within the sensitivity of elisa , decigo and bbo . </S>"
