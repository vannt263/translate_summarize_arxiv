    "nearly 120 molecules have now been observed in various sources in the interstellar medium .",
    "emission or absorption lines from these molecules carry important information on the physical conditions and the chemical properties of the various sources where they have been recognized .",
    "however , only a very limited number of molecules is used for that purpose , while much more information is available .",
    "the use of molecular lines detected with high resolution spectroscopy for studying the interstellar medium , and the star formation processes , are still largely unexplored .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy , either using heterodyne techniques in the radio domain , or with high dispersive power spectrometers , yields not only the line intensities but information on the gas dynamics through the analysis of line profiles .",
    "many lines can be analysed together for studying physical conditions .",
    "different approaches can be used to solve the radiative transfer equation , from the simplest lte model to sophisticated multidimensional models .",
    "also , other line properties can be exploited to get information on the magnetic field , either directly from the zeeman effect on paramagnetic molecules , or indirectly with other techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) . and finally , the molecular abundances are the basic information for the chemistry .",
    "the question which arises then is how to select the best molecule and the best lines to get useful information .",
    "all interstellar molecules can not be detected in the various environments of the ism .",
    "this evolution of the emerging spectrum , hence of the chemical properties , is tightly connected to the physical conditions and environment of the source . with the advent of more sensitive receivers and better mapping techniques , it is now possible to study extensively the chemical properties of specific sources .",
    "for example @xcite have performed detailed observational studies and modeling of a large set of interstellar molecules in cloud cores .",
    "we present in this paper new studies of interstellar chemistry devoted to carbon chemistry and the condensation processes on dust grains , which make use of molecular line observations .",
    "carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the interstellar medium , and also the more versatile for building molecules .",
    "carbon chemistry can therefore be viewed as the core of interstellar chemistry .",
    "most interstellar molecules ( 74 % , or 85 out of 114 ) have at least one carbon atom .",
    "the heaviest and most complex molecules are organic molecules with carbon .",
    "this statistics does not take into account the pahs , nor the dibs carriers which most likely hypothesis are large organic molecules ( @xcite ) .",
    "carbon , neutral or ionized , is also one of the main reactants in interstellar chemistry networks , due to the large number of organic molecules , but also to the reactivity and versatility of carbon , which can participate in numerous chemical reactions at any temperature , from the very cold dense cores , to warm and hot gas . therefore understanding the carbon chemistry is of major importance in astrochemistry , and for star formation . as a first step",
    ", we discuss diffuse clouds and photon dominated regions , and determine the carbon budget .",
    "we then discuss dark clouds chemistry and compare the carbon budget in all environments .",
    "at last we compare observations and state of the art models .",
    "while ch , ch@xmath0 and cn are known in the ism since the 40 s , the detection of other molecules in diffuse gas has paused for a while .",
    "but recent deep observations have revealed and/or confirmed the presence of diatomic , triatomic and even more complex molecules in diffuse gas .",
    "carbon clusters ( c@xmath1 , c@xmath2 ) are now almost routinely detected in the visible towards bright stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "c@xmath2 can be seen in the far infrared through its low energy vibration mode ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; and maybe also c@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "detections in the far infrared are obtained towards the massive star forming region sgrb2 close to the galactic center , and sample more opaque clouds than typical diffuse clouds .",
    "typical numbers for column densities and abundance ratio are given in table [ tab : dif ] .",
    "using radio telescopes @xcite have shown that cch and c - c@xmath2h@xmath1 are ubiquitous in diffuse gas , confirming previous work by @xcite .",
    "these two species are spatially correlated and present a well defined abundance ratio n(cch)/n(c - c@xmath2h@xmath1 ) = @xmath4 in diffuse clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the previous work used strong background continuum sources such as quasars to search for molecular absorption lines .",
    "the supernova remnant , cas  a , one of the strongest radio source in the sky , is a good target to search for absorption lines . @xcite and @xcite have reported the detection of c@xmath2n and c@xmath3h along this line of sight . though the physical conditions are not as accurately determined as in the diffuse clouds , these observations confirm the presence of rather complex molecules in different environments exposed to uv radiation . 0.3 cm    * diffuse clouds ; absorption lines * +    lcccc molecule & n(x ) & @xmath5 & @xmath6 & ref . + & ( @xmath7 ) & & & + c & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & 0.008 & 1 + ch & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & 1 & 1 + c@xmath1 & @xmath12 & @xmath11 & 1 & 1 + c@xmath2 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & 15 & 2 + c@xmath3 ? & @xmath15 & & & 3 + cch & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & 4 + c - c@xmath2h@xmath1 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & 30 & 4 + c@xmath3h & @xmath20 & @xmath19 & 30 & 5 +    * pdrs * +    .typical column densities and abundances in diffuse clouds and in pdrs [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : depletion ]    _ for sources listed in column ( 1 ) , column ( 2 ) gives the extincion , column ( 3 ) the column density of water ice , column ( 4 ) the column density of co ice , column ( 6 ) the column denisty of co@xmath1 ice , and column ( 6 ) the column density of gas phase co deduced from c@xmath21o data ( see text ) .",
    "all column densities are given in units of 10@xmath22 @xmath7 .",
    "data from teixeira and emerson ( 1999 ) , nummelin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and murakawa et al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "in all interstellar environments , dark and diffuse clouds , and pdrs , carbon chains and cycles are closely related to each other , and to atomic carbon .",
    "they are present in large abundances in the moderately dense molecular gas but avoid the darkest and densest cores .",
    "this conclusion is valid for the pure carbon chains and cycles .",
    "other carbon species , like cyanopolyynes are found in high density regions .",
    "though their formation mechanism also involves carbon , the difference between nitrogen and carbon chemistry may contribute to the different spatial distribution .",
    "the difference of incident radiation between diffuse or uv illuminated gas on one side , and dark clouds on the other side , affects somewhat the relative abundance of carbon molecules in permitting the growth of larger chains ( compare the abundance of c@xmath3h in tmc-1 and in the horsehead nebula ) but the chemistry looks nevertheless very similar . another major difference between diffuse or uv illuminated gas on one side , and dark clouds on the other side , is the condensation of abundant gas phase molecules on dust grains .",
    "the main impact of condensation on the chemistry is the enhanced abundance of molecular ions in depleted region .",
    "the reason for this is that the destruction channels for molecular ions are not only dissociative recombination reactions with electrons , but also reactions with abundant gas phase molecules .",
    "the depletion of co on dust grains therefore leads to lower destruction rates for molecular ions and larger abundances .",
    "while the composition of molecular ice depends mainly on the total extinction , marked chemical differences are found in lines of sight with similar column densities . also , measured abundances of carbon chains and cycles are often larger than steady state predictions .",
    "the usual explanation for understanding the large abundances , is to invoke the so - called `` early time chemistry '' , in which clouds are seen in an early evolutionary stage since their formation , in which the available carbon , initially ionized , has not be completely transformed into co. however , several arguments show that `` early time chemistry '' can not be the sole explanation .",
    "early time chemistry is efficient because the formation of molecular hydrogen and the conversion of carbon to co takes a very long time ( @xmath23 years ) when starting from atomic gas .",
    "it is thus tempting to use molecular abundances in dark clouds as a chemical clock .",
    "however the same arguments leading to doubt on `` early time '' chemistry , are also against this  ` chemical clock '  idea for dense cores .",
    "\\i ) since the same molecules , with similar abundances , are seen in many different clouds , at different evolutionary stages , such as pdrs , pre - stellar clouds , clouds having already formed stars , how could we be viewing `` early time '' chemistry in all cases ? for example , clouds having already formed stars and clouds associated with pdrs can not be presented as `` young '' since they have already had time to collapse and form stars , and for pdrs the newborn stars have had time to disrupt their parent clouds . even if the evolution is not uniform across a cloud ( chemical time scales depend on the density , so that more diffuse regions evolve at a slow pace compared to dense cores ) the requirement of `` early time '' , i.e. a cloud age lower than 10@xmath24 years is very strong compared to the typical time scale for cloud formation and evolution towards forming stars ( @xmath23 years , @xcite ) .",
    "\\ii ) a second argument against `` early time '' chemistry is the heavy dependence of the predicted chemical abundances on the initial conditions @xcite while observations show well defined chemical properties .",
    "other processes are known to strongly affect the chemistry , and may favor the presence of carbon and carbon chains in cloud envelopes .",
    "the propagation of uv radiation depends on the grain optical properties .",
    "@xcite have shown that grain growth in dark clouds affects the grain optical properties hence the propagation of uv radiations and the photodissociation rates in dense gas .",
    "this effect leads to higher abundances of neutral and ionized carbon compared to models using the grain properties valid for diffuse gas .",
    "it must be remembered that photons play a very important role in interstellar chemistry , even in dark clouds since the interaction of cosmic rays with hydrogen leads to the production of uv photons deep into the clouds .",
    "in addition , the chemical equilibrium for moderately dense gas can be carbon rich , the hip solution ( @xcite ) even without any incident uv photons .",
    "these last two explanations rely on microscopic processes and choice of elemental abundances .",
    "but the structure and dynamical state of interstellar clouds also affects the chemistry .",
    "clumpy cloud models , such as those of @xcite or @xcite can explain the widespread distribution of carbon by the accumulation of many clump surfaces , rich in carbon , in telescope beams .",
    "since uv radiation can penetrate deeper into clumpy clouds than in homogeneous structures , each clump surface behaves as a mini - pdr in this context .",
    "another idea is to include the effect of turbulence in homogeneous clouds .",
    "the main effect of turbulence is to increase the diffusion between the cloud surface and its interior .",
    "a small level of turbulent diffusion , compatible with the observations , can maintain higher abundances of atomic carbon and atomic hydrogen in cloud envelopes than in steady state models , in agreement with observations of atomic hydrogen in dark clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that all additional physical mechanisms described above , both microscopic ( change of optical properties of dust grains , abundances ) and macroscopic ( turbulence , chemistry ) and possibly others still to uncover , contribute significantly to the chemistry .",
    "there are so many unknowns in the physical properties and chemistry of dark clouds , that deriving the age of clouds from their chemical abundances is not reliable .",
    "clues from the age of embedded stars , if any , the geometry , the environment etc . must be used to retrace the history of interstellar structures . to progress",
    ", the whole evolution of interstellar clouds , from their formation in the warm neutral gas , to their concentration in molecular gas , and finally the birth of new stars , must be better understood than it is now .",
