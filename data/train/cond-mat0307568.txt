    "it has long been known that transport properties of a superconducting weak link may be strongly affected by external time dependent ( ac ) fields . to give an example , just after the discovery of the josephson effect it was found that an alternating rf - field will rectify the ac josephson current that results from a dc voltage bias and produce voltage steps  shapiro steps  in the current - voltage characteristics @xcite .",
    "this effect can be viewed as a synchronization of the josephson current oscillations of frequency @xmath0 , generated by a bias voltage @xmath1 , and the current oscillations induced by the ac field . if the josephson coupling energy @xmath2 is a simple harmonic function of the superconducting phase difference @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the positions @xmath5 of the shapiro steps are given by the expression @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is the frequency of the ac field .",
    "deviations from a simple harmonic relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 result in additional `` fractional '' steps at voltages @xmath9 .",
    "however their heights are exponentially small when @xmath10 .     across the system .",
    "an important difference between these two examples of a mesoscopic weak link is that the discrete energy levels inside the gap @xmath11 are well separated from the continuum levels ( dark bands ) for an scpt but not for an spc ( see text ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    new opportunities to influence the transport properties of josephson junctions by external ac fields appear in mesoscopic systems , where only few quantum states are responsible for the superconducting charge transfer . for such weak links the josephson energy",
    " no longer a macroscopic quantity ( being proportional to the area of the junction )  may be of the same order of magnitude as the energy quantum @xmath12 of the external ac field .",
    "if so , the alternating field may significantly affect the current by inducing resonant inter - level transitions between charge carrying states in the junction and thereby changing their population .",
    "the internal structure of the mesoscopic weak links determines the physical origin of the discrete energy spectrum and the relative positions of the energy levels inside the superconducting gap @xmath13 .",
    "superconducting point contacts ( spcs ) and single - cooper - pair transistors ( scpts ) are two fundamentally different examples of mesoscopic weak links . in an spc such as",
    "the one sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , the rapid variation of the superconducting phase across the junction gives rise to quasiparticle bound states ( andreev states ) that are localized to the vicinity of the contact .",
    "the discrete energy levels ( andreev levels ) associated with these states appear inside the superconducting gap as shown in fig .",
    "their positions @xmath14 are defined by the single electron scattering matrix and in the case of low transparency contacts one finds that @xmath15 . in an scpt , which is composed of two low - transparency tunnel junctions in series forming a small island as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , the coulomb blockade phenomenon @xcite strongly affects the structure of the energy spectrum . if the superconducting gap @xmath11 is greater than the coulomb energy of a grain charged by a single electron , the ground state of the scpt with a completely isolated central dot , for certain gate voltages , is degenerate with respect to adding one more cooper pair to the dot @xcite .",
    "weak cooper - pair tunnelling that removes this degeneracy gives rise to current carrying cooper - pair resonant states , separated  as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b  from the continuum spectrum by an energy of order @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between an spc and an scpt in how the energy spectrum depends on the superconducting phase change across the system . in an spc",
    "the subgap level ( as described above this is a discrete energy level in the gap between the ground state and the continuum excitation spectrum ) is mixed with the continuum spectrum at certain values of the phase difference , while the cooper - pair resonant levels in an scpt are always separated from the continuum , forming a well defined two - level system .",
    "the microwave dynamics of a biased spc was explored in ref .  , where it was shown that quantum interference among a sequence of temporally localized inter - level transitions results in nontrivial transport properties of a josephson weak link of this type . in an spc , however , coherence may be preserved only during a fixed length of time , since the discrete andreev states die away as they periodically merge with the continuum spectrum at certain values of the phase difference .",
    "( we recall that a voltage bias makes the phase difference increase linearly with time ) .",
    "in contrast , since the discrete energy levels are here always separated from the continuum , the microwave - induced transport properties of a biased scpt is to a great extent defined by the coherent dynamics of the two - level system and strongly affected by interference processes . in order to demonstrate this phenomenon , we explore below the microwave dynamics and transport properties of a biased scpt",
    ".     applied to the gate electrode , which is capacitively coupled to the island .",
    "a bias voltage @xmath1 is applied across the scpt giving rise to a linear time dependence of the phase difference @xmath16 between the leads , width=302 ]",
    "a sketch of the scpt structure to be considered here is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where a nanoscale superconducting island  capacitively coupled to a gate electrode  is shown to serve as a bridge between two bulk superconducting leads .",

    "the first term in the hamiltonian governs the electrostatic energy associated with the number of extra cooper pairs on the grain , while the second and third terms describe the josephson coupling between grain and leads .",
    "below we consider the symmetric case for which @xmath25",
    ". therefore , the josephson part of the hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known that if the characteristic coulomb energy @xmath27 associated with charge fluctuations due to cooper pair exchange between grain and leads , is significantly larger than the josephson energy @xmath28 , while at the same time the coulomb energy @xmath29 related to _ single _",
    "electron fluctuations is smaller than the superconducting energy gap , the low - energy states of the grain are given by a superposition of only two charge states that differ in charge by 2e .",
    "below we will assume that the gate voltage is chosen in such a way that @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "in that case the state of the grain is a superposition of the charge state @xmath32 , describing the neutral grain , and the charge state @xmath33 with one extra cooper pair .",
    "if @xmath34 the coulomb energy in the states @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the same .",
    "this degeneracy is , however , removed by the josephson coupling that induces cooper pair exchange between the mesoscopic grain and the bulk electrodes . as a result",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with eigenvalues @xmath35 are given by symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the states @xmath32 and @xmath36 .",
    "these states , which we will refer to as cooper - pair resonant states , will  if occupied  carry currents given by @xmath37 .     in the single - cooper - pair transistor ( scpt ) of fig .",
    "dashed lines represent microwave - induced inter - level transitions occurring at times @xmath38 , when the resonance condition @xmath39 is satisfied .",
    ", width=302 ]    a bias voltage makes the phase difference over the junction change with time , @xmath40 .",
    "this time dependence generates a periodic variation of the relative positions of the josephson levels as well as a periodic change in the current that can be carried by the corresponding resonant cooper pair states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the total josephson current through the junction depends on the relative `` population '' @xmath41 of the levels and is given by the formula @xmath42 ( @xmath43 are probabilities to find the system in the states @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "one can find important differences between the ac josephson effect in such a system and in ordinary josephson junctions .",
    "if the coulomb blockade is totally lifted , there are no inter - level transitions as the levels cross each other and consequently @xmath46 is controlled only by relaxation processes .",
    "even if the temperature is much lower than the characteristic inter - level distance , a weak relaxation to the ground state with rate @xmath47 leads to an equalization of the level populations . as a result",
    "the josephson current will be proportional to @xmath48 and in the limit @xmath49 not only the dc but also the ac current through the josephson junction vanishes .",
    "the situation is different if an oscillatory voltage is applied to the gate .",
    "a time dependent gate voltage makes the induced charge vary in time as well , @xmath50 .",
    "this in turn gives rise to inter - level transitions which control the level populations and by this means one may stimulate the josephson current .",
    "the most interesting case , which will be considered below , appears when the frequency of the gate voltage oscillations @xmath8 is of the same order as the frequency of charge fluctuations on the grain @xmath51 . in this case",
    "the inter - level transitions have a resonant nature and significantly influence the cooper pair transport even for relatively small variations of the gate potential .    in the present work we consider a situation where the energy quantum @xmath52 of gate voltage oscillations , is of the same order but smaller than the maximum inter - level energy distance @xmath53 . at the same time we take @xmath8 to be much larger than the rate of the gate - voltage induced resonant inter - level transitions , @xmath54 . under these conditions and if one considers the time evolution of the system at low bias voltages , @xmath55 , one can neglect inter - level transitions except during short time intervals @xmath56 near the times",
    "@xmath38 , when the resonance condition@xcite @xmath57 is fulfilled ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "during these time intervals landau - zener type inter - level transitions will occur ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "therefore the evolution of the system we are interested in is given by a sequence of scattering events separated by periods of `` free '' evolution , during which the level populations do not change .",
    "despite the fact that the level positions vary periodically in time with period @xmath59 , the dynamics of the system , strictly speaking , is not periodic .",
    "this is because the phases of the complex elements of the scattering matrix depend on the phase @xmath60 which defines the value of induced charge at time @xmath61 .",
    "this fact is of great importance for the transport properties of the system . as we will show below , if the ratio @xmath62 is an irrational number the dynamics of the system is qusiperodic and the dc josephson current is equal to zero .",
    "but if this ratio is a rational number , then a dc josephson current does flow through the junction .",
    "the maximum value of the current appears when @xmath62 is an integer .",
    "using the cooper - pair resonant states representation one can recast the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the pauli matrices .",
    "as already anticipated , we will assume that the following relations are fulfilled : @xmath66 here @xmath67 and @xmath68 are integer numbers .",
    "the final result , other than details of calculations , does not depend in any essential way on the arithmetic properties of @xmath69 , and for definiteness we take @xmath68 to be an even number ( @xmath70 is odd ) . under these conditions",
