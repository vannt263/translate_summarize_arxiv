    "it was realized quite early that in the high - energy limit the two - gluon exchange is the dominant reaction mechanism of two heavy vector meson production .",
    "the relevant amplitude was calculated first in the heavy - quark non - relativistic approximation in @xcite , and first estimates of the cross section were presented there .",

    "some other estimates based on parametrizing dipole - dipole interaction were presented in @xcite . perhaps surprisingly",
    ", there is actually a substantial spread in the predictions shown in those works , they do not seem consistent one with each other and differ by almost two orders of magnitude . for a number of reasons",
    ", it seems that these previous evaluations are not very realistic in the intermediate energy range relevant to studies of the @xmath10 sub - process in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "firstly , the process considered in the mentioned papers is not the lowest order of strong coupling constant",

    "was used in order to calculate the two - loop amplitudes . at high energies , these mechanisms correspond to the quark - antiquark exchanges in the crossed channels and will die out with increasing @xmath10 energies .",
    "the numerical predictions of @xcite were however shown only at high ( linear collider ) energies ( @xmath11 400 gev ) where this mechanism is definitely not the dominant one .",
    "secondly , previous calculations of the two - gluon exchange mechanism were restricted to the extreme non - relativistic limit , and neglect the motion of heavy quarks in the bound state . here , we shall calculate the two - gluon exchange contribution using for the first time for this process relativistic non - forward impact factors .",
    "furthermore , by introducing a gluon mass , we investigate the infrared sensitivity of the amplitude , which turns out to be rather strong .",
    "therefore in the present work we wish to discuss both mechanisms simultaneously and discuss and identify the region of their dominance .",

    "in addition , we have also estimated a contribution of pseudoscalar ( @xmath112 ) meson exchange mechanism .",
    "the latter ones turned out to be practically negligible .",
    "the elementary cross section has been used to calculate cross section for ultra - peripheral ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions ( @xmath113 ) at the lhc . in this context",
    "we have used equivalent photon approximation in the impact parameter representation and realistic charge form factor of the @xmath114 nucleus . the nuclear cross section has been estimated and distribution in the @xmath7 rapidity and invariant mass have been presented . the cross section for double @xmath8 production",
