    "polymer microgels are a hybrid between a colloid and a polymer and the combination of these two classes of materials offers a number of advantages @xcite .",
    "the well - defined shape and size of a colloid provides control over the microstructural length scales and response times while the polymeric nature offers physico - chemical control parameters that can be sensitive to external stimuli .",
    "the most widely studied material of this kind is based on the polymer poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) @xcite .",
    "it can be readily cross - linked during synthesis to obtain microgel particles with a size that can be controlled in the range 100 - 1000 nm .",
    "the vast interest stems from the fact that the polymer is thermosensitive with a lower - critical solution temperature of approximately 32@xmath0c , which is close to physiological conditions @xcite .",
    "the volume phase transition of the microgels can also be induced by addition of alcohols @xcite and by changes in ph which offers a plethora of possibilities for the design of stimuli responsive materials and for sensing and substance release applications @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that the polymer collapse is reminiscent of protein denaturation @xcite . despite the overwhelming interest a direct visualization of volume phase transition of individual particles in - situ",
    "has so far been lacking .",
    "the size of microgel particles is typically a micrometer or less and therefore conventional light microscopy can not resolve its internal structure .",
    "measurements by atomic force microscopy have been reported in the collapsed dry state only @xcite .",
    "equally , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) is normally only applied to dried and collapsed microgels @xcite . in one study cryo - tem",
    "has been applied to swollen polystyrene - pnipam core - shell particles at a single temperature @xcite .",
    "this method , although cumbersome and suffering from low contrast , might have potential for the characterization of the internal microstructure of pnipam microgels .",
    "equally modern synchroton based x - ray nanotomography , with a resolution in the 50 nm range , could in principle be used @xcite . scattering methods using x - ray , neutrons and light",
    "do have the required resolving power and have thus been employed frequently @xcite .",
    "however they only provide information about radially averaged properties of an ensemble of particles and thus information on a single part level is not accessible . in recent years",
    "superresolution microscopy techniques have emerged that in principle can provide nanoscopic optical resolution@xcite . despite their overwhelming popularity in the field of bioimaging very few successful examples for their application in materials sciences",
    "are known @xcite . here",
    "we report on the in - situ superresolution microscopy of pnipam microgels revealing the internal microstructure during swelling and collapse of individual particles induced by addition of controlled amounts of methanol to the solvent @xcite .",
    "the microgels are synthesized by free radical precipitation polymerisation in a batch reactor using n - isopropylacrylamide ( acros organics , 99% ) , nipam , as the monomeric unit and n-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride ( polysciences ) , apma , as a co - monomer .",
    "the co - monomer is used in order to incorporates free amine groups into the microgels that are further used as conjugation points for the fluorescent biomarker alexa fluor 647 .",
    "n , n-methylenebis(acrylamide ) ( sigma - aldrich , 99% ) , bis , is used as a cross - linker .",
    "nipam is re - crystalized in hexane and all other chemicals are used as received .",
    "nipam ( 1.460 g ) and bis ( 0.103 g ) are dissolved in 85 g of h@xmath1o .",
    "apma ( 0.0066 g ) is dissolved in 10 g of h@xmath1o .",
    "5 g of the apma solution is added to the reactor and the reaction mixture is left to de - gas under an argon atmosphere for 40 minutes before the temperature is raised to 70 @xmath0c .",
    "the initiator , 2,2-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine ) dihydrochloride ( sigma - aldrich , 97% , 0.0365 g ) is dissolved in 5 g of h@xmath1o prior to addition to the reaction mixture . 3 minutes after the initiator is added the injection pump is started , injecting the remaining 5 g of apma solution at an addition rate of 0.5ml / min .",
    "the synthesis is carried out for 4 h before the reaction mixture is left to cool down over night under constant stirring .",
    "the microgels are then dialysed ( dialysis tube , mwco 10.000 , spectrum laboratories ) against de - ionized water for two weeks in order to remove unreacted species .",
    "the resulting microgels have a degree of cross - linking of 4.9mol% and a co - monomer concentration of 0.27mol% assuming complete consumption of all components . to label the microgels we mix them with an excess amount of fluorescent dye in water inside a clean eppendorf .",
    "we then place it on a slowly oscillating platform at room temperature for 2 hours .",
    "multiple cycles of centrifugation and resuspension are then performed to remove unreacted dye .",
    "typical experiments last several minutes thus requiring immobilization of the sample . to achieve this",
    "we irreversibly adsorb the particles by placing drop of microgel suspension between two glass coverslips , spreading it into a thin layer , then placing it in the oven at 55@xmath0c until they are dry .",
    "the coverslips are previously treated with piranha solution ( a mixture of sulfuric acid ( h@xmath1so@xmath2 ) and hydrogen peroxide ( h@xmath1o@xmath1 ) ) to clean them thoroughly .",
    "the particles are then resuspended in the appropriate water - methanol solution and found to be immobile for the duration of the experiments .",
    "the solution also contains cysteamine ( sigma aldrich ) at 50 mm concentration and the ph is adjusted to 8 using hcl .",
    "these steps are essential to achieve blinking of fluorophores @xcite . in principle , to achieve optimal blinking and therefore the highest possible resolution one should also add oxygen scavengers such as glox @xcite to the imaging solution .",
    "we decided to only include cysteamine in order to keep the systems as pure as possible , preserving the microgel deswelling behaviour at the expense of fluorophore brightness and photostability .",
    "we use a commercial light scattering goniometer ( alv , germany ) for the characterization of the size of the microgel particles in suspension . a green laser wavelength ( @xmath3=532 nm )",
    "is selected because it does not excite the fluorophores present in the microgel structure .",
    "we extract the dynamic light scattering hydrodynamic radius @xmath4 from a standard first cumulant fit of the intensity correlation function at three different scattering angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the viscosity of the mixture has been taken from published values @xcite .",
    "the radius and polydispersity measured by means of static light scattering are obtained by fitting the scattered intensity as a function of the scattering vector @xmath7 to the fuzzy sphere modelof stieger et al . @xcite .",
    "the contribution of back - reflected light at high scattering angles is taken into account with an additional adjustable parameter as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to avoid aggregation of the microgels at higher temperatures we lower the cysteamine content to 20 mm until the suspension",
    "is found stable . to verify that cysteamine has no influence on particle size we also perform measurements at different concentrations , before the onset of aggregation , and find the size to be unchanged .",
    "we apply direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( dstorm ) for supper resolution imaging as described in @xcite . to this end",
    "we use a 897nikon tieclipse inverted microscope , equipped with an emccd camera ( andor ixon ultra ) and a total internal reflection fluorescence ( tirf ) arm to achieve highly inclined illumination situation with limited fluorescence background noise .",
    "the illumination is provided by a powerful red laser ( coherent genesis 1w at 639 nm ) and a weaker violet one ( toptica 120mw at 405 nm ) , both coupled into a single mode fiber into the tirf arm .",
    "the light is focused on the back aperture of a high numerical aperture and magnification objective ( na 1.49 and 100x magnification ) , collimating the beam .",
    "illumination with the red laser is used to achieve sparse fluorophore blinking while the violet laser is used in order to tune the density of blinking molecules .",
    "an extra zoom lens is placed before the camera to achieve a final pixel size corresponding to an edge length of 104 nm at the given magnification .",
    "a dichroic filter with a central wavelength of 700 nm and bandwidth of 75 nm is placed in the detection pathway ( et700/75 , chroma ) . for every image",
    "we reconstruct we acquire 60 000 frames with 8 - 10ms exposure time and em gain set to 300 . the thousands of images",
    "are then analyzed using the open source software thunderstorm which determines , for every fluorescent spot , the position , brightness and localization precision @xcite .",
    "we keep only points that are localized with a precision below 15 nm .",
    "to correct for residual small drifts the image stack is subdivided into 20 subsets , each is used to reconstruct an image , then those images are cross correlated to determine drift information .",
    "the same software is also used to reconstruct superresolution images @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional imaging is performed using the method of astigmatism @xcite which we implement using the adaptive optics microscope add - on micao ( imagine optic , france ) . with the micao in place the point spread function changes shape depending on the axial position of the fluorescent emitter .",
    "we calibrate for this by imaging fluorescent beads ( 100 nm diameter tetraspeck , termofisher ) scanned through the focal plane . due to",
    "the refractive index mismatch between the sample and the glass a focal shift is present and must be corrected for . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "since the sample is within 1.5 microns of the coverslip surface , it is sufficient to rescale all axial positions by a factor of 0.57 when using the same optics .",
    "we determine the nanoscopic resolution from the distribution of measured localizations obtained by the same fluorophore .",
    "although the fluorophore position is immobile it still gives stochastically spread localizations which can be modelled by a gaussian .",
    "the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) then gives us the lateral resolution which we determine to be 30 nm on average .",
    "we note that fitting @xmath8 for the collapsed microgels with a box profile of constant density equally yields a resolution of @xmath930 nm . the axial resolution is estimated to about 60 nm but this value does not enter our analysis and thus has not been determined with the same accuracy .",
    "we prepare dilute pnipam microgel particle suspensions at room temperature ( t=22@xmath0c ) in a mixture of water and methanol .",
    "pure water is a good solvent for poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) at the selected temperature and the microgels are highly swollen .",
    "methanol is chosen as a deswelling agent because it offers a convenient handle to induce the volume phase transition by changing the solvent composition . moreover , deswelling with methanol does not require setting accurately different temperatures in the microscope sample chamber . adding some percentile of methanol induces deswelling until the particles are maximally collapsed for a methanol content of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we first apply static ( sls ) and dynamic light scattering ( dls ) to characterize the microgel particles in situ for different solvent compositions .",
    "as we add methanol we observe a shift of the minimum of the scattering curve @xmath11 towards larger values of @xmath7 and an increase of the scattered intensity , fig .",
    "[ fgr : sls ] .",
    "these observations show that the microgel particles deswell .",
    "we can model the scattering curves quantitatively in the weak scattering or rayleigh - gans - debye approximation considering an isotropic density distribution . to this end",
    "we fit the experimental data with the fuzzy sphere model of stieger et al .",
    "@xcite taking into account polydispersity and internal reflections in the light scattering cuvette .",
    "the model is derived by convoluting the box profile of a homogeneous sphere , radius r , with a gaussian , standard deviation @xmath12 . in fourier space",
    "the convolution is represented by a product and the intensity distribution takes the simple form @xmath13 } \\mathord{\\left/ { \\vphantom { { \\left [ { \\sin \\left ( { qr } \\right ) - qr\\cos \\left ( { qr } \\right ) } \\right ] } { \\exp \\left ( { - { { { { \\left ( { { \\sigma _ { surf}}q } \\right)}^2 } } \\mathord{\\left/   { \\vphantom { { { { \\left ( { { \\sigma _ { surf}}q } \\right)}^2 } } 2 } } \\right .",

    "\\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace } 2 } } \\right ) } } } \\right]^2}$ ] .",
    "the simplicity of this expression is to a large extent responsible for the success of this model although it has been recognized early - on that the model is not entirely satisfactory as it does not predict a decay to zero density at a finite distance @xcite .",
    "alternative models for the density distribution have been suggested such as an antisymmetric parabolic shell @xcite , a linear shell profile @xcite or a dense core covered by a brush @xcite .",
    "the latter describes well the onset of particle - particle interactions but until now has only been discussed for a brush with constant density @xcite . in practice",
    "we find the fit of the fuzzy sphere model to the light scattering data excellent as shown in fig .",
    "[ fgr : sls ] .",
    "we observe that the particle core radius @xmath14 shrinks from 215 nm to 171 nm . at the same time",
    "the shell of about @xmath15 nm thickness collapses to nearly zero . from dynamic light scattering ( dls ) on the same samples we obtain the hydrodynamic radius of the particles @xmath4 .",
    "as suggested in previous studies we find that @xmath16@xcite .      for the dstorm characterization",
    "the microgel particles need to remain at a fixed position for several minutes .",
    "we thus chose to irreversibly adsorb the particles on a microscope slide . to this end",
    "we first dry , on a glass coverslip , a small amount of the microgel suspension at 55@xmath0 .",
    "after resuspension in the appropriate solvent the particles are found to remain immobile .",
    "next we perform dstorm @xcite measurements by homogeneously illuminating the sample at 639 nm under nearly total internal reflection conditions , fig .",
    "[ fgr : dstorm ] . for comparison",
    "we also show an image taken with conventional wide - field microscopy under the same conditions .",
    "additional illumination at 405 nm is added when necessary to maintain a sufficient density of blinking fluorophores . for each image",

    "the axial resolution is lower than in the plane and is estimated to be 60 nm , still an order of magnitude better than confocal microscopy .",
    "such 3d imaging on the nanoscale might not be crucial for more or less isotropic microgels but will become of key importance whenever the particle architecture is more complex such as for ellipsoidal particles or heterogeneous structures @xcite . in our experiments",

    "this value is somewhat smaller than the one obtained from static light scattering , figure [ fgr : sls ] .",
    "we believe this discrepancy is due to the failure of the rayleigh gans debye approximation in light scattering due to the finite refractive index contrast even for the low density swollen microgels @xcite . the latter result is a hint for the power of a visualization of the individual microgels",
