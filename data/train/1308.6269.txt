    "eventually this peak overwhelms all other features in the tunnel spectrum . at the lowest temperatures and @xmath10  the height of this peak can exceed the tunneling conductance observed at zero magnetic field by several orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact , the tunneling current - voltage ( @xmath12 ) characteristic at @xmath0  closely resembles the dc josephson effect observed in superconducting junctions .",
    "it is clear that this dramatic transport anomaly is deeply reflective of the many - body physics of exciton condensation ( or pseudo - ferromagnetism , if one prefers ) at @xmath0 , and there is by now an extensive theoretical literature on the subject @xcite .",

    "four ohmic contacts ( 1,2,3,4 ) are positioned at the ends of arms attached to the outside rim of the annulus , while two more ( 5,6 ) are located on arms attached to the inner rim .",
    "a selective depletion scheme allows these contacts to be connected to one or the other 2d layer separately , or to remain connected to both layers simultaneously @xcite . a schematic layout of the device is shown in fig .",
    "[ device ] .",
    "electrostatic gate electrodes on the sample top and thinned backside allow the densities @xmath20 of both 2dess in the annulus to be separately controlled .",
    "( we here confine ourselves to the balanced case , @xmath21 . )",
    "these gates allow the effective layer separation @xmath10  at @xmath0  to be varied @xmath22 at low temperatures .",
    "the tunneling measurements reported here are primarily performed by recording the current @xmath23 which flows in response to a dc voltage @xmath24 applied between two ohmic contacts on one or the other rim of the annulus , with one contact connected to the top 2d layer and the other to the bottom layer . at the same time , the remaining ohmic contacts are used to record the voltage differences @xmath25 between the layers which develop in response to the tunneling .",
    "owing to the physical separation of the contacts , these voltage differences will , in general , contain both inter- and intra - layer contributions",

    ", we will use the subscript pair @xmath26 to denote the specific contacts employed in a given measurement , with @xmath27 referring to the contact number ( 1 - 6 , as shown in fig . [ device ] ) and @xmath28 being either @xmath29 or @xmath30 to indicate which layer ( top or bottom ) is being contacted . for example , @xmath31 denotes an external dc voltage applied between contact 2 on the top layer and contact 1 on the bottom layer , whereas @xmath32 is the measured inter - layer voltage between the top layer at contact 3 and the bottom layer at contact 4 .",
    "the essential physics underlying the coherent @xmath0  bilayer quantum hall state is spontaneous interlayer phase coherence . owing to coulomb interactions , electrons in the bilayer",
    "are shared equally between the layers , even in the absence of single particle tunneling .",
    "hence , when an electron definitely in one layer arrives at the edge of a @xmath0  droplet , it is presumed to rapidly hybridize between the layers as it moves away from the injection point along the edge of the droplet .",
    "if this hybridization occurs over a very short length scale , one might guess that the conductance measured between two contacts on the edge of the droplet would not depend much upon whether the contacts are connected to both 2d layers simultaneously , as in a conventional intra - layer transport measurement , or are connected to opposite individual layers , as in an inter - layer tunneling measurement . as we now show , at @xmath0  this guess is obviously incorrect .",
    "figure [ inter_vs_intra ] shows two measurements at @xmath0  of the current @xmath23 which flows in response to an external voltage @xmath24 applied between contacts 1 and 2 on the outside rim of the corbino ring . for these measurements ,",

    "this is not surprising since the net series resistance ( much of which is in the 2des arms leading from the ohmic contacts in to the corbino ring ) is larger when only a single 2des is available to carry the current toward and away from the corbino ring .",
    "however , at around @xmath37 @xmath38v , the current abruptly falls from about @xmath39 na to about @xmath40 na .",
    "further increases of @xmath24 elicit only a slowly falling current as the bilayer 2des system enters a highly resistive state .",
    "we emphasize that this highly non - linear behavior is not due to the breakdown on the quantum hall effect itself .",
    "independent measurements reveal that the hall resistance remains at its quantized value of @xmath41 throughout the domain of the blue trace .    the data shown in fig .",
    "[ inter_vs_intra ] allow us to conclude that interlayer charge transfer , present in the blue trace but not in the red trace , fundamentally affects the two - terminal conductance along the edge of a coherent @xmath0  droplet .",
    "it seems that there is a maximum , or critical current for such tunneling transport @xcite . for samples in which single - particle tunneling is absent , or at least extremely weak ( as it is in the present samples )",
    ", it has been shown that the injection of an electron into just one of the 2d layers at the edge of the droplet necessarily excites both quasiparticle charge transport along the edge and the emission , _ into the bulk _ , of neutral excitons within the @xmath0  condensate @xcite .",
    "it is this connection to the dynamics of the exciton condensate that renders inter - layer tunneling such an effective tool for studying the coherent @xmath0  bilayer system .",
    "figure [ 2v4](a ) contrasts two- and four - terminal tunneling @xmath12 curves at @xmath0 .",
    "these data were again obtained at @xmath10  = 1.49 and @xmath34 mk where the bilayer 2des is well within the coherent excitonic phase .",
    "the blue trace shows the tunneling current @xmath23 plotted versus the dc excitation voltage @xmath31 applied between the source and drain contacts on the outer rim of the annulus .",
    "this is therefore a two - terminal @xmath12 characteristic and , as such , includes the effects of extraneous resistances in series with the tunnel junction .",
    "prominent among these series resistances are `` contact '' resistances of order @xmath42 associated with the injection and withdrawal of current from @xmath0  quantum hall fluid in the corbino ring itself @xcite , and substantial resistances in the single - layer 2d electron gas arms which connect the bilayer in the ring to the remote ohmic contacts . taken together ,",
    "the net series resistance ( @xmath43 k@xmath35 ) accounts for the overall slope of the two - terminal @xmath12 curve at low bias and its weak non - linearity @xcite very close to @xmath44 .    in order to remove the effects of the series resistances ,",
    "a four - terminal @xmath12 curve is constructed by plotting the tunneling current @xmath23 versus the simultaneously recorded inter - layer voltage difference @xmath32 which appears between the two remaining contacts on the outer rim of the corbino ring ; the result is the red curve in fig .

    "the two voltages are essentially identical when the tunnel junction is in the resistive state .",

    "[ 2v4]a ) detected .",
    "as we next discuss , these various effects are due to circuit instabilities arising from the interplay of the series resistance and the non - linear character of tunneling at @xmath0 .      instabilities in tunneling @xmath12 characteristics at @xmath0  were first observed by tiemann _",

    "as the resistive state initially develops , the differential resistance @xmath46 of the tunnel junction is therefore negative .",
    "if @xmath46 is negative and sufficiently small , or if the series resistance @xmath47 is sufficiently large , the two can cancel one another .",
    "put another way , the circuit load line @xmath48 may intersect the intrinsic @xmath49 curve of the tunnel junction at more than one point .",
    "the circuit is then unstable and often hysteretic .",
    "this is a common and sometimes useful aspect of circuits containing strongly non - linear elements ( e.g. tunnel diode oscillators ) .",
    "the basic correctness of the above explanation for the observed instabilities is easily verified by systematically adding external series resistances @xmath50 to the tunneling circuit .",

    "( as a corollary to this , when jumping from the resistive to the `` supercurrent '' branch , the junction arrives at a lower absolute current than the maximum current attained immediately prior to jumping in the reverse direction . )",

    "[ hr2](b ) ] improves the fit at higher voltages , but only at the expense of a poorer fit near the cusp in the @xmath12 curve at the critical current .",
    "apparently , the transition from the `` supercurrent '' branch to the resistive branch at very low temperature is not captured by the hr theory @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this conclusion does not rely on the efficacy of the incoherent tunneling subtraction since the latter contribution to the tunneling current is negligible at these low voltages . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the hr theory does a much better job .",
    "this situation was actually anticipated by hr who point out that at very low temperatures , where @xmath28 is small , their perturbative approach to tunneling may no longer be justified @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic feature of the tunneling @xmath12 curves at @xmath0  is the nearly vertical `` supercurrent '' branch observed around zero bias at very low temperatures .",
    "this feature , which strongly resembles the dc josephson effect , has been the subject of intense interest for over a decade . in this section",
    "we describe the results of measurements in this portion of the tunneling @xmath12 curve , restricting our attention to the vicinity of zero tunneling current .      for the tunneling @xmath12 data presented above , the four - terminal voltage difference is measured between top and bottom layer contacts which are physically separated along the edge of the corbino annulus .",
    "consequently , this voltage is `` diagonal '' and will , in general , contain both inter- and intra - layer contributions . fortunately , the intralayer part of this voltage can be separately measured and then subtracted from the diagonal voltage to yield the purely interlayer voltage at either contact .",
    "for example , the inter - layer voltage at contact 2 can be deduced from measurements of the diagonal voltage @xmath102 and the intra - layer voltage @xmath103 , via kirchoff s law : @xmath104 .",
    "( note that kirchoff s law implies that the same inter - layer voltage can be determined in two independent ways : @xmath105 . )",

    ", the intra - layer voltages are negligible in comparison to the inter - layer voltages .",
    "when the coherent @xmath0  state is well - developed , the inter - layer voltages along the `` supercurrent '' branch are sufficiently small ( typically sub-@xmath38v ) that dc amplifier drift makes ac lock - in detection essential . in what follows ,",
    "we describe inter - layer voltage measurements performed using purely ac @xmath106 excitation , with @xmath107 na at 13 hz . to avoid spurious signals arising from capacitive effects",
    ", we found it necessary to inject the current using a ratio - transformer bridge in order to reduce the common - mode voltage of the tunnel junction .",
    "in addition to recording the inter- and intra - layer voltages which developed , the current was also measured so that small deviations from perfect current bias could be accounted for .",
    "the ratio of the ac inter - layer voltage at contact @xmath108 to the ac tunneling current provides a measure of the resistance @xmath109 of the `` supercurrent '' branch around zero bias .",

    "this stands in sharp contrast to the critical tunneling current @xmath55 which , as fig .",
    "[ contact_indep ] proves , is independent of the source / drain contact configuration .",
    "our data suggest that by @xmath118 mk , the resistance of the `` supercurrent '' branch falls to around @xmath119 @xmath35 . by this measure",
    ", the zero bias tunneling conductance @xmath120 at @xmath0  is some 6000 times larger than it is at zero magnetic field where tunneling is essentially a single - particle phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this comparison makes plain the highly collective nature of tunneling at @xmath0 .",
    "the similarity between the tunneling @xmath12 characteristics in coherent @xmath0  bilayers and superconducting josephson junctions was first noted by spielman _",
    "_ via two - terminal measurements on weakly tunneling samples of small area @xcite .",
    "subsequent measurements by tiemann _",
    "@xcite displayed the striking difference between two- and four - terminal tunneling experiments on large area strongly tunneling samples .",
    "this difference arises both from extrinsic series resistance in the measurement circuit and from an intrinsic quantum hall contact resistance @xcite . aside from reproducing tiemann s findings , we have shown that the instabilities and hysteresis in the @xmath12 are not deeply related to the many - body physics of the coherent @xmath0  bilayer but instead arise from relatively mundane circuit effects which become important when tunneling is strong @xcite .    in spite of the instabilities and hysteresis effects observed in strongly tunneling situations",
    ", we have shown that the maximum , or critical , tunneling current @xmath55 is unaffected by them and is a genuine feature of tunneling in coherent @xmath0  systems .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath55 is an intrinsic property of the system , being independent of the contact configuration used to make the tunneling measurement and limiting the total tunneling current even when two source - drain contact pairs on opposite rims of the corbino annulus are used to inject current .",
    "these findings support the prior evidence that tunneling in coherent @xmath0  bilayers is a bulk phenomenon , with the maximum tunneling current proportional to the area of the 2d system .",
    "this scaling with area is surprising since one expects , in an ideal , disorder - free @xmath0  system , tunneling currents to be confined to within a short distance of the source and drain contacts .",
    "this distance , @xmath121 ( with @xmath75 the pseudospin stiffness in the coherent phase , and @xmath77 the single - particle tunnel splitting in the double quantum well ) , is analogous to the josephson penetration length in superconducting junctions @xcite and is estimated to be in the @xmath38 m range , far smaller than the mm - scale dimensions of our corbino ring .",
    "presumably , as has been suggested @xcite , disorder in realistic @xmath0  samples leads to an effective coarse - grained average of @xmath122 which is much larger than the ideal value .",
    "consistent with prior results @xcite , we find that @xmath55 depends strongly on the effective layer separation @xmath10  at @xmath0 , rising from zero at @xmath123 to @xmath124 na at @xmath125 and @xmath34 mk . surprisingly , however , we find that the temperature dependence of the normalized critical current @xmath66 ( with @xmath63 the @xmath126 value of the critical current ) is nearly independent of @xmath10 . to the extent",
    "that this is precisely the case , our data suggest that the critical current is of the form @xmath127 , with @xmath128 a function of @xmath10  alone and @xmath129 a function of @xmath130 alone , with the characteristic temperature @xmath131 independent of @xmath10 .",
    "it seems peculiar that the temperature - induced suppression of coherent interlayer tunneling would be independent of @xmath10 , since this parameter reflects the relative strength of inter- and intra - layer coulomb interactions and governs the onset of all the exotic transport phenomena observed at @xmath0 .",
    "one speculative possibility is that @xmath131 is determined entirely by disorder , the bare unscreened potential of which is fixed , independent of the electron density in the quantum wells .",
    "we emphasize however , that @xmath66 is not precisely independent of @xmath10 , with deviations visible at the largest effective layer separations .",
    "moreover , at higher temperatures , where the maximum tunneling current occurs at a significant non - zero voltage , incoherent processes contribute substantially to the tunneling current . subtracting these contributions , in a manner similar to that described in sec .",
    "[ hr ] , will likely enhance the @xmath10  dependence of @xmath66 .    at elevated temperatures we find that the recent phenomenological theory @xcite of the tunneling lineshape agrees reasonably well with our observations , provided that the incoherent contribution to the tunneling current is subtracted .",
    "at lower temperatures this does not seem to be the case .",
    "the experimentally observed tunneling @xmath12 curve then shows a very pronounced cusp - like feature where the `` supercurrent '' branch meets the resistive portion of the @xmath12 characteristic .",
    "fits of the hyart - rosenow @xcite theory to the data do not capture this cusp .    while the maximum _ two - terminal _ tunneling conductance at @xmath0",
    "is expected to remain finite ( and of order @xmath132 ) down to the lowest @xmath10  and temperature @xcite , the situation is less clear regarding the four - terminal conductance around zero bias .",
    "our results , summarized in fig .",
    "[ rtun ] , clearly show that the resistance of the `` supercurrent '' branch falls rapidly with temperature , but remains finite certainly down to @xmath133 mk and likely to even lower temperature .",
    "experimentally , therefore , it does not appear that the condensate phase @xmath4 is time - independent along the `` supercurrent '' branch , even if its precession rate is vastly less than it is on the resistive portion of the @xmath12 curve .",
    "in our view , this is not surprising .",
    "the data presented here and elsewhere have shown that tunneling at @xmath0  occurs throughout the bulk of the 2des . in order for this to be true , in - plane transport must be involved . in spite of the very small conductivity of the bulk for net charge transport ( the coherent @xmath0  bilayer is a conventional quantum hall system in this regard ) ,",
    "it is virtually transparent to neutral exciton transport within the condensate @xcite .",
    "since the latter consists of counterflowing charge currents in the two layers , it can readily relax the anti - symmetric charge defects created by tunneling . as a corollary therefore , any dissipation accompanying exciton transport can be expected to also show up in the tunneling @xmath12 curve . at the same time , the local interlayer voltage created by such dissipation would naturally depend on the spatial distribution of the exciton transport .",
    "this could account for the dependence of the resistance @xmath117 of the `` supercurrent '' branch on the relative locations of the source , drain , and interlayer voltage contacts shown in fig .",
    "[ rtun ] .",
    "dissipation in counterflow transport has , to date , been most sensitively studied in experiments employing hall bar geometries @xcite .",
    "all of these experiments suggest that dissipation remains finite down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "moreover , the experiments show that for small currents , the observed response is linear ; there is as yet no clear evidence for the predicted non - linear effects due to current - induced vortex pair ionization @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the data shown in fig .",
    "[ rtun ] suggest that the temperature dependence of the resistance of the `` supercurrent '' branch is not terribly different from simple thermal activation and , as mentioned above , is in fact comparable to that observed for conventional in - plane charge transport .",
    "( the data shown in fig . [ rtun ] do show more curvature than is typically found in the temperature dependence of conventional charge transport . )",
    "similarity between the observed dissipation in counterflow and ordinary quantum hall transport at @xmath0  has been noticed before , in both electron - electron @xcite and hole - hole @xcite bilayers .",
    "this similarity suggests that dissipation in counterflow at low temperatures is governed by the ordinary quantum hall energy gap for charged quasiparticles . if , as has been suggested @xcite , the motion of single , disorder - induced , unpaired vortices is responsible for the observed dissipation in neutral exciton transport , these observations suggest that the same process may also be responsible for dissipation in ordinary charge transport .",
    "this contrasts with the usual theoretical assumption that the dominant charged excitation at @xmath0  is a meron - antimeron pair . while carrying electrical charge ( @xmath134 ) ,",
    "such objects are vortex neutral and thereby unable to unwind an excitonic superflow .",
    "an extensive set of tunneling measurements on strongly correlated bilayer 2d electron systems at @xmath0  has been reported here .",
    "our results are consistent with the many prior experimental observations but also provide several different perspectives .",
    "prominent among these are the observations of an unexpected scaling behavior the maximum , or critical , tunneling current and a precise independence of the critical current on contact configuration . our findings also provide a detailed view of the temperature dependence of the tunneling resistance along the `` supercurrent '' branch of the @xmath12 curve and allow for a sensitive comparison to recent theories of the tunneling lineshape .",
