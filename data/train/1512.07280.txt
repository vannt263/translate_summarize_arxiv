    "after the lhc s run 1 and beginning of run 2 , we are now more confident that the observed @xmath10 gev scalar boson is the long sought higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . however , although its brilliant success in describing particle physics , still many pressing questions are awaiting convincing solutions that can not be answered within sm .",
    "the hierarchy problem and the neutrinos oscillations are the most illustrative ones . in this context , many theoretical frameworks have been proposed and the most popular one is supersymmetry .",
    "the search for supersymmetry at run i of lhc gave a negative result .",
    "therefore the original motivation of susy to solve hierarchy problem by suppressing quadratic divergencies ( qd ) is questionnable . in this case , it is legitimate to propose other perspective to interpret and control the qd . it is known that one has to call upon new physics to deal with such problem . more specifically , the new degrees of freedom in a particular model conspire with those of the standard model to modify the veltman condition and to soften the divergencies @xcite .    in this paper , we aim to investigate the naturalness problem in the context of type ii seesaw model , dubbed htm , with emphasis on its effect of the htm parameter space .",
    "more precisely , we will study how to soften the divergencies and how to gain some insight on the allowed masses of the heavy scalars in the higgs sector .",
    "a more recent work of kundu et al.@xcite has partially discussed this issue . however , unlike the analysis in @xcite , our study use the most general renormalisable higgs potential of htm @xcite and is essentially based on dimensional regularisation approach which complies with unitarity and lorentz invariance @xcite . more importantly , the phenomenological analysis takes into account the full set of theoretical constraints , including unitarity @xcite and the consistent conditions of boundedness from below @xcite .",
    "this work is organised as follows . in section @xmath11",
    ", we briefly review the main features of higgs triplet model and present the full set of constraints on the parameters of the higgs potential .",
    "section @xmath12 is devoted to the derivation of the modified veltman condition ( mvc ) in htm .",
    "the analysis and discussion of the results are performed in section @xmath13 , with emphasis on the effects of mvc on the heavy higgs bosons , particularly on charged higgs .",
    "conclusion with summary of our results will be drawn in section @xmath14 .",
    "type ii seesaw mechanism can be implemented in the standard model via a scalar field @xmath15 transforming as a triplet under the @xmath16 gauge group with hypercharge @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the most general @xmath18 gauge invariant lagrangian of the htm scalar sector is given by @xcite :    @xmath19    the covariant derivatives are defined by , @xmath20+ig ' \\frac{y_\\delta}{2 } b_\\mu{\\delta } \\label{eq : covd2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the higgs doublet while ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , and ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) represent the @xmath16 and @xmath26 gauge fields and couplings respectively .",
    "@xmath27 , with @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are the pauli matrices .",
    "the potential @xmath30 reads as , @xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\lambda_1(h^\\dagger{h})tr(\\delta^{\\dagger}{\\delta})+\\lambda_2(tr\\delta^{\\dagger}{\\delta})^2 + \\lambda_3tr(\\delta^{\\dagger}{\\delta})^2 + \\lambda_4{h^\\dagger\\delta\\delta^{\\dagger}h } \\label{eq : vpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes the trace over @xmath33 matrices .",
    "the triplet @xmath15 and doublet higgs @xmath21 are represented by : @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "+ after the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs doublet and triplet fields acquire their vacuum expectation values @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , and seven physical higgs bosons appear , consisting of : two @xmath39 neutral scalars ( @xmath40 , @xmath1 ) , one neutral pseudo - scalar @xmath2 and a pair of simply and doubly charged higgs bosons @xmath3 and @xmath4 .. , @xmath41 and the charged sectors , dubbed @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 see @xcite ] the masse of these higgs bosons are given by @xcite , @xmath45}{4\\upsilon_t}\\label{eq : mhpm}\\\\ & & m_{a^0}^2 = \\frac{\\mu(\\upsilon_d^2 + 4\\upsilon_t^2)}{\\sqrt{2}\\upsilon_t}\\label{eq : ma0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the entries of the @xmath39 mass matrix defined by , @xmath48 in the remainder of this paper , we assume the light @xmath39",
    "scalar @xmath40 as the observed higgs with mass about @xmath49  gev .",
    "the htm higgs potential parameters are not free but have to obey several constraints originating from theoretical requirements and experimental data .",
    "thus any phenomenological studies are only reliable in the allowed region of htm parameter space . + _ : _ + first , recall that the @xmath50 parameter in htm at the tree level is given by the formula , @xmath51 which indicates a deviation from unity .",
    "consistency with the current limit on @xmath50 from precision measurements @xcite requires that the limit @xmath52 resulting in an upper limit on @xmath38 about @xmath53  gev .",
    "+ _ : _ + many experimental mass limits have been found for the heavy higgs bosons . from the lep direct search results , the lower bounds on @xmath54  gev for models with more than one doublet in the case of the neutral scalars .    as to the singly charged higgs mass we use the lep ii latest bounds , @xmath55  gev from direct search results , whereas the indirect limit is slightly higher @xmath56  gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the present lower bound from lhc is @xmath5 @xmath57  gev , where the excluded mass ranges established by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite are taken into account . in the case of the doubly charged higgs masses ,",
    "the most recent experimental upper limits reported by atlas and cms are respectively @xmath58  gev @xcite and @xmath59  gev @xcite .",
    "these bounds originate from analysis assuming 100% branching ratio for @xmath60 decay .",
    "however , note that one can find realistic scenarios where this decay channel is suppressed with respect to @xmath61 @xcite invalidating partially the lhc limits .",
    "for example , in htm with moderate triplet vev , @xmath62  gev , the analysis of @xmath63 decay channel can easily overpasses the two - sign same lepton channel for @xmath6 where the limit decreases up to @xmath64  gev @xcite . + as to the theoretical constraints on the parameter space , we should take into account the perturbativity constraints on the @xmath65 as well as the stability of the electroweak vacuum that ensure that the potential is bounded from below ( bfb ) .",
    "let us first recall all the constraints obtained in @xcite    _ : _ @xmath66    _ : _",
    "@xmath67    we stress here that all values presented in the plots and in our subsequent analysis ( section @xmath14 ) are consistent with all theoretical and experimental bounds described in this section .",
    "the method to collect the quadratic divergencies in a framework of dimensional regularisation is due to veltman @xcite and needs a dimensional gymnastics since the space - time dimension to pick up the quadratic divergencies depends on the number of loops .",
    "but the idea to use the quadratic divergencies to get physical insights is much older , and goes back to the pioneering work of stuckelberg in 1939 @xcite . in the context of a renormalisable theory ( which is our case ) , it is not clear that the deductions coming from such a concept are pertinent .",
    "indeed it provides for relations between the masses or / and the couplings constants of the theory , which could give some credit to an underlying and hypothetical symmetry .    from a more basic level",
    ", one can imagine that the relations found by this method are indicative and could provide orders of magnitude , bounds or constraints and we will follow this line in this work . this is more or less the point of view of chakraborty - kundu @xcite where they apply the cancellation of quadratic divergencies to the htm , the standard model extended by a scalar triplet .",
    "but we differ from this work in the way to pick up the quadratic divergencies .",
    "they use the cut - off method to regularise the divergent integrals although we will use the veltman method that we will sketch later on .",
    "both methods have advantages and back - draws that we will not discuss here , since they provide for similar relations .",
    "we just mention that the cut - off method is intuitive but neither lorentz nor gauge invariant .",
    "a contrario , the dimensional regularisation method is both lorentz and gauge invariant , although less intuitive .",
    "we refer to previous works such as @xcite and references therein for more details and discussions .    to check the veltman conditions one needs to calculate the quadratic divergencies which show up in the tadpoles of the two cp - even neutral higgs of our model , namely @xmath40 and @xmath1 .",
    "since vacuum is supposed to be cp - even , the tadpole associated with the neutral pseudoscalar field @xmath2 vanishes .",
    "also , it is noticeable that no qcd contribution appears at one loop level , hence only the electro - weak part of the htm model is concerned in this procedure . since there is no derivative couplings , it is easy to figure out how to calculate each diagram ( see the appendix for all relevant vertices required for such calculation ) . aside the coupling constant , we just need to consider the propagator of the field in the loop , where the contribution of each loop can be written in a simple form in terms of the passarino - veltman function @xmath68 @xcite .    in a 4 dimensional space - time , @xmath69 , up to some pure numerical factor , where @xmath70 is the pole term .",
    "in a 2 dimensional space - time , @xmath71 is no longer mass dimensioned and it is a pure u.v .",
    "divergent number ; this property is fundamental because it guarantees a gauge invariant result . this pure number will be forgotten everywhere in this section since irrelevant in the equations , together with other common factors like the dimensional dependence of the coupling constants .    for the propagator of a scalar particle in htm higgs sector , ( @xmath72 ) ,",
    "we have @xmath73 leading to a @xmath71 contribution . for a vectorial particle ( @xmath74",
    ", we have @xmath75 leading to a @xmath76 contribution , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the transverse and the longitudinal projectors and @xmath79 is the space - time dimension . for a true fermionic particle ( massive leptons and quarks )",
    ", we have @xmath80 leading to a @xmath81 contribution .    to get the final results , one just has to sum up all the possible diagrams , taking into account the @xmath82 for the fermionic loops ( including faddeev - popov ghosts ) , the symmetry factor @xmath83 of the diagram @xmath84 and possibly the color factor for the quarks that we forget for conciseness . as a matter of fact , for the higgs particle @xmath85 one gets : @xmath86 where the couplings @xmath87 , the symmetry factors @xmath83 and the propagator loops @xmath88 are given in the appendix .",
    "this formula leads , in a 2 dimensional space time , to a quite large formula depending on many parameters of the model as well as the mixing angles .",
    "similarly , for the other cp - even higgs particle @xmath1 , one only has to change @xmath89 into @xmath90 as indicated in the appendix where these coefficients are listed .",
    "to summarise , the veltman condition implies that the quadratic divergencies of the two possible tadpoles @xmath91 and @xmath92 of the @xmath40 and @xmath1",
    "cp - even neutral scalar fields vanish .",
    "both results are not very tractable , so we do not write them . the linear combination of the fermionic coupling constants @xmath93 is zero ; further it turns out that the combination @xmath94 induces simplification and one ends up with the short and nice expression : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the square of the standard model vacuum expectation value ( @xmath98 gev ) .",
    "of course , it is very tempting to calculate the orthogonal combination , @xmath99 , which also leads to a simple result , where the quarks contributions must be multiplied by the color factor : @xmath100 + here , we do comment both results .",
    "the two linear combinations @xmath101 and @xmath102 reproduce the real neutral components of the triplet and the doublet of the htm , after their vev shifts .",
    "so @xmath103 and @xmath104 represent the quadratic divergencies of the fields @xmath105 and @xmath106 , as can be shown from eq .",
    "( 2.26 ) of @xcite .",
    "hence , its is straightforward to understand that all mixing angles disappear in @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the absence of the @xmath107 parameter in @xmath103 is obvious since @xmath107 is the coupling constant of the pure doublet quartic interaction . in the same way ,",
    "the absences of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are also natural in @xmath104 since these two couplings only concern the triplet .",
    "we are also faced up to two intriguing questions : why the fermionic part is missing in the first equation ?",
    "why the @xmath110 parameter is missing in both equations ?",
    "the answer to the first question , on one hand , we have already noticed that the cancellation originates from the combination @xmath111 , that is on the form of the trilinear couplings higgs - fermion - antifermion . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of fermionic part lies in the form of the yukawa coupling with the triplet @xmath15 , given by eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , a close look shows that the fermionic doublet @xmath112 is no longer associated with @xmath113 but with @xmath114 , that forbids any @xmath115 coupling , insuring the absence of fermionic contribution at one loop order .",
    "about the second question , it is bizarre because @xmath110 is the strength of a trilinear coupling between doublets and triplet , so a priori able to give contribution , but the interaction is linear in the triplet and a _ doublet - triplet - triplet _ vertex is excluded , that explains the lack of @xmath110 in @xmath104 . as to @xmath103 ,",
    "the solution is again in the form of the interaction where we have the doublet @xmath21 and the transposed doublet @xmath116 but not @xmath117 : before breaking of the symmetries and the vev shifts , a coupling such as @xmath118 is forbidden . then after breaking and shifting the fields , we end up with two vertices , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , with opposite values @xmath121 , where @xmath106 and @xmath122 are the real and imaginary parts of the shifted field @xmath123 .",
    "this feature suffices to cancel these two contributions in a 2 dimensional space - time , when the loop does not depend on the propagator mass as explained before . in some sense ,",
    "the quadratic divergencies record the physics before breaking and shifting , and this is probably not a pure one - loop effect .",
    "+ finally , it is worth to notice that veltman condition in standard model @xcite is recovered when , we remove the couplings @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the doublet formula @xmath104 , so discarding any mixing between doublet and triplet .",
    "in this section we will focus our analysis on the modified veltman condition ( mvc ) given in @xmath126 .",
    "our aim is twofold : first we will show that one loop quadratic divergencies are softened and go to zero within htm space parameter .",
    "the latter is consistent with theoretical constraints given in eqs .",
    "( @xmath127 ) , namely unitarity , bfb as well as absence of tachyon in the potential ( inducing a constraint on @xmath110 parameter )",
    ". it also complies with the observed higgs at @xmath10 gev and with lhc measurements for higgs decay to several channels ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 ) @xcite .",
    "here we only show results with the photon mode that has the best mass resolution .",
    "the second aim of our analysis is to gain more insight on the masses of the heavy higgs bosons and the effect of naturalness on their allowed range of variations .",
    "+ we plot in fig.[fig : fig1 ] , the scatter plot in the ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the figure shows the excluded regions of space parameter by unitarity ( red ) , by combined set of bfb and unitarity ( green ) .",
    "if in addition , we impose consistency withe atlas and cms combined data within @xmath134 on the diphoton decay mode , ( with a signal strength @xmath135 @xcite ) , the blue area is also discarded . furthermore , when the veltman condition for the doublet and triplet field enters into the game , we see a drastic reduction of the space parameter to a relatively small allowed region marked in brown .",
    "+ fig.[fig : fig2 ] illustrates the doubly charged higgs mass @xmath6 as a function of @xmath124 resulting from a scan over different values of @xmath125 and for @xmath136 .",
    "we find the only relevant parameter region where all of the constraints are imposed , is the area marked in grey which encodes cancellation of quadratic divergencies .",
    "this area is delineated by @xmath124 in the range[@xmath137 corresponding to @xmath138 varying from @xmath139 to @xmath8  gev . for these mass values , @xmath125 is limited to lie in a reduced interval between @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "+ the remarkable feature of effects of the modified veltman condition on the doubly charged higgs masse is clearly indicated in fig.[fig : fig3 ] showing the @xmath142 ratio ( signal strength ) as a function of the doubly charged higgs mass @xmath6 for different values of @xmath124 .",
    "first we consider the case when when mvc are absent ( red plot ) .",
    "we see that , small values of @xmath124 less than @xmath143 favour low @xmath6 varying between @xmath139 and @xmath144  gev , while for larger @xmath124 , its range of variation is significantly enlarged with an upper limit about @xmath145  gev . when mvc is turned on ( green plot ) , we show that the @xmath6 intervals get smaller and smaller for @xmath124 getting larger .",
    "we also note that unlike the lower limit which is unaffected by mvc , the upper bound is very sensitive to mvc and experiment a drastic reduction to @xmath8  gev .",
    "similar analysis is seen in fig.[fig : fig4 ] for the simply charged higgs mass . here",
    ", the same behaviour is reproduced : the lower mass , @xmath146  gev , is almost insensitive to the constraints including mvc , while the upper limit shows a substantial reduction from @xmath147  gev to @xmath7  gev when the conditions mvc are considered .",
    "these overall resulting ranges of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are compatible with the lhc exclusion limits on the charged higgs bosons ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "we have studied the naturalness problem in the type ii seesaw model .",
    "we have shown that the veltman condition is modified by virtue of the additional scalar charged states and that quadratic divergencies at one loop can be driven to zero within at the allowed parameter space of the model .",
    "furthermore , when a set of constraints , including unitarity , consistent boundedness from below , is combined with requirement of compatibility with the diphoton higgs decay data of lhc for the observed higgs at @xmath10  gev , the resulting parameter region is severely constrained .",
    "if in addition , the modified veltman condition is also imposed , the effects on the masses of heavy higgs bosons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are analysed .",
    "the analysis has shown a drastic reduction of the mass spectrum of @xmath5 and @xmath6 with an upper bounds at @xmath7 and @xmath8  gev respectively .",
    "these limits are still consistent with lhc measurements . besides",
    ", we have found an almost mass degeneracy of cp odd higgs and heavy cp even higgs , with @xmath149 .",
    "gev has been reported by atlas and cms with a local significance of @xmath150 and @xmath151 while the global significances are @xmath134 and @xmath152 respectively @xcite .",
    "although several interpretations of this intriguing signal in terms of higgs - like resonances have been proposed , this excess could be just another statistical fluctuation which will be washed away with more data . ]",
