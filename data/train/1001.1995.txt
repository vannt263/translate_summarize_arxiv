    "in the @xmath0be @xmath6-decay via electron capture ( ec ) process , the nucleus absorbs an electron from the atomic or molecular shell and is transformed to @xmath0li in the reaction @xmath7 .",
    "the decay rate is proportional to the electron density at the nucleus and therefore depends on the chemical environment of the radioactive isotope .",
    "@xmath0be has been used in investigations of the electron capture decay rate in various chemical states since the first studies by segre @xcite and daudel @xcite . by now",
    ", experimentalists have published the results of more than sixty measurements relating to @xmath8- and @xmath9-shell electron capture by @xmath0be in different chemical forms and media .    in 2005 - 2007",
    ", two teams studied the ec decay of @xmath0be inside the fullerene c@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it was found , that the half - life of @xmath0be in metallic beryllium measured at room temperature exceeds the one in @xmath0be@c@xmath1 at room temperature by 0.83% @xcite , and by 1.5% @xcite if the latter is measured at 5@xmath10 .",
    "this difference between the @xmath0be ec @xmath6-decay constants is the largest among available experiments . a density functional theory ( dft ) based numerical calculations of the electron density at the be nucleus",
    "have been presented in @xcite along with the experimental data .",
    "it was found that , in accordance with the experiment , the electron density at be encapsulated in the center of c@xmath1 is larger than the one at the nuclei in metallic beryllium .",
    "qualitatively , in the metal , the electrons are shared , decreasing their local density at the nuclei , while the beryllium atom in c@xmath1 remains intact . a more careful analysis",
    ", however , has shown that the electron density at @xmath0be@c@xmath1 is larger by 0.17% even in comparison with that in an isolated beryllium atom .",
    "the authors explain this result as a `` compression '' of the be s 2@xmath2 orbital inside c@xmath1 .",
    "the reason of the compression may be the `` repulsive interaction '' between be and the c@xmath1 cage according to @xcite .",
    "detailed understanding of the structure of atoms encapsulated in fullerens is important , in particular , for developing the concept of the fullerene as an isolating cage which `` does not affect '' the trapped single atom and `` protects '' it from the outer environment . in the present work ,",
    "we study the be - c@xmath1 interaction and its effect on the electron density at the be nucleus within the framework of hartree - fock ( hf ) based methods . although our value of the relative decay rate difference between metallic be and be@c@xmath1 is in qualitative agreement with the experimental one as well as with the results of the previous theoretical studies , we suggest a new theoretical interpretation of the physical nature of the enhanced electron density at be in c@xmath1 .",
    "we started with the structural optimization of be position inside c@xmath1 .",
    "the fullerene s geometry was taken from experiment @xcite ( the length of the long and the short bonds are 1.448  and 1.404  , respectively ) and fixed during the optimization , as the endohedral doping has , as expected , a small effect @xcite .",
    "the total energy of be@c@xmath1 complex at every trial configuration was calculated by the restricted ( singlet spin state ) hartree - fock method , with the 6 - 31g@xmath11 molecular basis set @xcite in a cartesian form . besides , the electronic correlations were taken into account within the second order perturbation method ( mp2 ) .",
    "for the calculations , we used our original program which employs the resolution of the identity ( ri ) method for the electron - electron interaction integrals and allows to perform the hartree - fock based calculations for large systems with moderate computational resources ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "for both the hatrtee - fock and the mp2 variants , the optimization results in the position of the be atom at the center of the fullerene are in full agreement with the previous dft based studies @xcite . in order to evaluate the interaction energy defined as @xmath12",
    ", we have performed additional calculations of the total energies of be atom , @xmath13 , and the fullerene , @xmath14 . besides , in a separate calculation , the basis set superposition error was taken into account by the counterpoise ( cp ) method @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : de ] .",
    "c|c|c & hf & hf+mp2 +",
    "cp corrected & 0.91 & -0.41 + uncorrected & 1.00 & -0.63 +    we therefore conclude that be atom s equilibrium position at the center of the fullerene belongs to the attractive region of the van - der - waals interaction , i.e. the be - c@xmath1 interaction is attractive and the be@c@xmath1 complex is stable in the ground state with respect to decay to be and c@xmath1 .",
    "this result is in contrast with the one of lu et.al .",
    "@xcite who concluded a `` slightly repulsive '' be - c@xmath1 interaction from a dft calculations , and obtained the value of + 1.05 ev for the interaction energy .",
    "we apply their speculations to our hartree - fock results , which also give the repulsive interaction as the pure hf method may not account of the dispersion energy .",
    "the consideration of lu et.al . is based on the modifications in the energy levels of the homo / lumo ( highest occupied / lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ) of the be atom and c@xmath1 upon formation of the be@c@xmath1 complex .",
    "our results , presented in figure  [ fig1 ] , differ qualitatively from those of @xcite , calculated with the b3lyp density functional with 6 - 31g@xmath11 molecular basis set . in @xcite , be s atomic 2@xmath2 level lies in the middle of c@xmath1 s lumo - homo gap .",
    "moreover , c@xmath1 s lumo - homo gap increases in @xcite upon endohedral doping with be , because the homo is slightly lowered by 0.03 ev , while the lumo is elevated by 0.04 ev .",
    "these results were interpreted by lu et al . as the evidence of a slight repulsion between",
    "the be atom and the fullerene cage in the be@c@xmath1 complex .",
    "our calculations show that the be s 2@xmath2 orbital in the be@c@xmath1 complex lies 0.14 ev lower than the c@xmath1 s homo ( see in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "( the be s 2@xmath2 orbital in isolated be atom lies 0.69 ev lower than the c@xmath1 s homo . ) furthermore , c@xmath1 s lumo - homo gap does not change upon the endohedral doping , and both orbitals are just slightly lowered by 0.01 ev .",
    "thus , there is little evidence of the `` repulsive interaction '' , according to the definition of lu at.al .",
    ", between be and c@xmath1 within the hartree - fock calculations , even if the calculated interaction energy is positive .",
    "the mulliken population analysis of our hf calculations with the 6 - 31g@xmath11 molecular basis set gives the charge of + 0.03 at be compared with -0.14 in the dft calculation of lu et.al with the same basis set .",
    "this makes the concept of a slight hybridization of between be and the fullerene orbitals unacceptable within the hatree - fock method .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the mulliken charges are not suitable basis set independent parameters for analysing the non - chemical interactions .",
    "then , we consider the local electron density at the beryllium nucleus .",
    "the electron density for a polyatomic system is given by the standard relation , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are normalized molecular orbitals , @xmath17  corresponding occupation numbers . in our case ,",
    "the orbitals are the hartree - fock orbitals calculated with danning s cc - pvtz molecular basis set ( @xcite ) used in a cartesian form .",
    "we employed two methods for the evaluation of the electron density at the nucleus which is formally located at the coordinate origin , @xmath18 . at first , we added narrow gaussian s - functions ( with exponents @xmath4 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 in inverse squared bohr radius , @xmath21 ) to the standard basis set .",
    "then , we extrapolated the local electron density near the nucleus to the @xmath18 point by using the known ( the consequence of the kato theorem @xcite ) non - relativistic asymptotic of the electron density for many - electron system at the coulomb center with charge @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the coincidence of the both values of electron density at the be nucleus with up to 0.02 a.u .",
    "( the atomic unit of density is equal to one electron in cubic bohr radius , @xmath24 ) , i.e. about 0.05% , reflects the level of numerical error for our method .",
    "the calculated electron densities at single be atom , metallic be and be@c@xmath1 are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "( details of the procedures for calculations of electron density at metallic be will be presented elsewhere . )",

    "though , the absolute value is somewhat larger then the measured 1.5% as well as the value of 1.7% obtained by the dft calculations @xcite . on the other hand",
    "our value is in excellent agreement with experimental data of kraushaar et al .",
    "@xcite of direct measurement of the @xmath0be half - life in the metal source @xmath26 days and the half - life of @xmath0be in @xmath0be@c@xmath1 @xmath27 days from the work @xcite : @xmath28    in the present paper we do not discuss these minor quantitative discrepancies neither between available experimental data , nor between various theoretical results .",
    "experimental data require the further specification . as to numerical results",
    "it is necessary to take into account that both methods of calculation contain approximations .",
    "the hartree - fock method correctly takes account of the exchange , but lacks for the electronic correlations .",
    "the model density functionals , on the other hand , make approximations for both the exchange and the correlations . to make reasoning about the accuracy of the methods , especially in the case of the non - chemically , weakly bounded molecules",
    ", one would refer to a more robust theories like the coupled clusters or the configuration interaction methods .",
    "instead , we are focussing on a qualitative phenomenon  the electron density difference between be@c@xmath1 and isolated be atom .",
    "the corresponding relative decrease of the electron density in our calculations is @xmath29% , in qualitative accord with the value of 0.17% in @xcite .",
    "the reason of the enhanced electron density in be@c@xmath1 might be a slight hybridization of be s and c@xmath1 s orbitals , as suggested in @xcite , so that the beryllium grabs the electron density from the fullerene .",
    "in that case , some of fullerene s orbitals would contribute to the electron density at be .",
    "however , only two orbitals ( those originated from atomic 1@xmath2 and 2@xmath2 ) make apparent contribution to the electron density at the be nucleus .",
    "thus , the hybridization concept has no support from the hartree - fock results .",
    "the structure of the be is therefore changed due to the potential effect of the fullerene . in particular",
    ", fullerene s electrostatic field might prevent beryllium s electrons to spread out the cage acting as a strong repulsive potential wall . in that case , a more compact 1@xmath2 orbital would not be affected . however , the 2@xmath2 one would rapidly vanish after certain distance from the center and would be compressed ( due to the normalization ) in the internal region resulting in the enhanced density at the nucleus .",
    "this concept , which also was expressed in @xcite , is in full accord with the data from table  [ tab2 ] as well as with the increased energy of the 2@xmath2 orbital of be in c@xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , a more detailed analysis of the spherically averaged electron density curves for the 1@xmath2 and 2@xmath2 orbitals of atomic be and be in c@xmath1 presented on figure  [ fig2 ] rules out the concept of _ repulsive _ potential wall . indeed ,",
    "be s 2@xmath2 orbital inside the fullerene , though tends to zero at @xmath30 , then rapidly increasing and becomes even larger than the one of isolated be atom .",
    "below , we suggest a different solution to this intriguing issue .     and 2@xmath2 states for isolated be atom , and the first and the second orbitals of the be atom in the be@c@xmath1 complex : 1 ( 5 )  2@xmath2 ( 1@xmath2 ) be , hartree - fock ; 2 ( 6 )  2@xmath2 ( 1@xmath2 ) be@c@xmath1 , hartree - fock ; 3 ( 7 )  2@xmath2 ( 1@xmath2 ) be@c@xmath1 , model potential in figure  [ fig3 ] ; 4 ( 8)  2@xmath2 ( 1@xmath2 ) be@c@xmath1 , model potential with model potential well in figure  [ fig3].,width=377 ]    the electron density of the 2@xmath2 orbital vanishes at @xmath30 since the corresponding wave function crosses zero and changes its sign .",
    "zero probability for the electrons to occupy the vicinity of @xmath3 imitates the repulsive core for the 2@xmath2 electrons of be in c@xmath1 .",
    "however , the origin of the additional node in the wave function is the _ attractive _ potential well at @xmath31 .",
    "spherically averaged electrostatic potential extracted from the hartree - fock electron density of c@xmath1 ( dashed - line curve in figure[fig3 ] ) is attractive . to illustrate the phenomenon , we designed a model spherical potential for the 2@xmath2 orbital of be ( see in figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it consists of the screened coulomb potential as well as the spherical attractive potential well centered at @xmath32 .",
    "the screening constant was chosen to reproduce qualitatively the 2@xmath2 orbital for the isolated atom .",
    "it turns out , that the addition of the attractive potential into the model potential results in the appearance of the second node for 2@xmath2 orbital , in the increase of its energy ( in full agreement with the result of hf calculation , see in figure[fig1 ] ) and also in the increase of the electron density at @xmath33 .",
    "orbital in the be@c@xmath1 complex : 1  coulomb potential ; 2  model potential ( screened coulomb potential ) ; 3  potential well extracted from hartree - fock electron density ; 4  model potential `` 2 '' with model potential well.,width=302 ]",
    "the reason of this phenomenon becomes clear from the following analytically solvable model .",
    "let us compare the 2@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 electron wave functions and the energy levels in the coulomb potential ( figure  [ fig4 ] ( a ) ) and in the new potential shown in figure[fig4 ] ( b ) .",
    "( this is the same coulomb potential combined with the spherical potential layer . )     and 3@xmath2 states in : ( a ) coulomb potential ; ( b ) coulomb potential combined with a spherical potential layer .",
    "( c ) energy level and electron wave function of 1@xmath2 state in a single spherical potential layer.,width=642 ]    we consider here only @xmath2 wave functions @xmath34 , because @xmath35 for all @xmath36 states in non relativistic limit , and these @xmath36 states do not give a contribution to the decay of @xmath0be .",
    "the electron radial wave functions for the combined potential in figure  [ fig4 ] ( b ) are    @xmath37    here , @xmath38 is the confluent hypergeometric function , the wave numbers are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the energy of the state ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the energy @xmath41 are determined from the conditions of continuity and differentiability of the wave function at the boundaries @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are internal and external radiuses of the potential layer correspondingly .    for definiteness , we take charge @xmath48 for the coulomb potential and depth @xmath49 ev for the spherical layer located between @xmath50 a@xmath51 and @xmath52 a@xmath51 .",
    "the energy and the electron density at the nucleus of the 2@xmath2 state in this potential are @xmath53 ev and @xmath54 a@xmath55 , correspondingly .",
    "if we add the spherical potential layer to the coulomb potential , as it is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] ( b ) , and will gradually increase its depth up to the value of 50 ev , we will see the following .",
    "the energy of the 2@xmath2 state decreases ; its wave function gradually moves from the region of the coulomb potential to the region of the spherical layer and becomes similar to the wave function of the 1@xmath2 state in the isolated potential layer shown in figure  [ fig4 ] ( c ) .",
    "the electron density of the 2@xmath2 state at the nucleus decreases according to figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "and 3@xmath2 states at the point @xmath18 as a function of spherical potential layer depth @xmath56.,width=302 ]    at the same time the 3@xmath2 state gradually takes up the space region occupied previously by the 2@xmath2 state .",
    "depending on the width of the spherical potential layer and on its depth @xmath56 , the energy of the 3@xmath2 state in the new combined potential may lie both above and below of the 2@xmath2 energy level in the coulomb potential , and may have either a higher or a smaller electron density at the nucleus ( see in figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , the mechanism of the variation of electron density of the 3@xmath2 state at the nucleus , shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , follows .",
    "the electron density in the origin , @xmath57 , depends on the energy of the state @xmath58 .",
    "for example , @xmath59 in the coulomb potential , @xmath60 in the infinite potential well and so on .",
    "the absolute value of the energy , @xmath61 , of the 3@xmath2 state increases , when the depth @xmath62 of the spherical potential layer grows . at the same time , gradual redistribution of the 3@xmath2 electronic density between the area of coulomb potential and the spherical potential layer starts . for a relatively small @xmath62 , the space occupied by the 3@xmath2 wave function in the area of the potential spherical layer increases comparatively slowly , because the area of localization of the wave function practically does not vary , and the spherical potential layer does not have its own binding state .",
    "if the layer has a large depth , the situation changes .",
    "there is a binding state in the deep isolated spherical potential layer now .",
    "the energy of the 3@xmath2 state in the joint potential verges towards the energy of such binding state , moving simultaneously from the position of the binding state in the pure coulomb field .",
    "a part of the wave function occupies the forbidden for classical movement area ( between the coulomb potential and the spherical potential layer ) , and the considerable enhancement of the 3@xmath2 electron density occurs in the area of the spherical potential layer .",
    "the reduction of the wave function in the area of the coulomb potential is not compensated anymore by growth of the @xmath61 energy , and the electronic density at the nucleus decreases fast , returning at first to the initial value ( see in figure  [ fig5 ] ) , and tends to zero at the further increase of the spherical potential layer depth .    by applying the above considerations to the be@c@xmath1 system one",
    "concludes the following .",
    "the c@xmath1 fullerene modifies the coulomb potential of the be atom in such way , that the 3@xmath2 state in the joint potential occupies approximately the same position as the 2@xmath2 state in the isolated be atom .",
    "that is , the 3@xmath2 state has approximately the same energy and practically the same electron density inside the be atom as the 2@xmath2 state in coulomb potential .",
    "moreover , corresponding wave function @xmath63 has the second node , which imitates the repulsion of the electrons of the be atom from the c@xmath1 cage at @xmath3 .    as regarding the",
    "be 2@xmath2 state , the energy of this state becomes considerably smaller in the new potential .",
    "furthermore , its wave function moves to the potential well formed by the fullerene .    in that way",
    ", the small increase of electron density at the be nucleus has casual character .",
    "one could obtain another result with different parameters of the `` fullerene potential well '' ( for example , by doping of c@xmath1 with certain atoms ) .",
    "thus , we obtain infrequent possibility to control the @xmath0be decay by means of a non - chemical interaction . in the considered particular case , this is the electrostatic interaction between the be atom and the fullerene .    to confirm , that the proposed mechanism does not depend on the model , we also have considered two different analytically solvable models  a particle inside two `` independent '' and two connected spherical potential wells .",
    "the results obtained are in a good qualitative agreement with those described above .",
    "it is interesting to note in the end , that the problem considered here is not physically new and has a vague similarity with the well known problem of the repulsive core in nuclear physics .",
    "the concept of repulsive core in @xmath4-@xmath4 and @xmath5-@xmath5 interactions had been accepted as correct right until the seventies of the last century .",
    "this repulsive core arose at small distances as the consequence of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "it was established later that this concept was simplified . in some cases",
    ", the repulsive core must be understood in terms of the nodal wave function for relative motion in an attractive potential ( see in refs . @xcite and references therein ) .    in other words ,",
    "the zero probability for particle to occupy certain region can be achieved both by the infinite potential wall ( repulsive core ) and by the node of the wave function in an attractive potential . in this sense",
    "the phenomenon considered in the present paper resembles the above mentioned effects in the @xmath4-@xmath4 and the @xmath5-@xmath5 interactions .",
    "in summary , according to our hartree - fock calculations with the electronic correlations accounted at the mp2 level , the lowest energy singlet configuration of be atom encapsulated in c@xmath1 is the one at the center of the fullerene ,  in accordance with previous dft studied .",
    "the be atom resides in the attractive region of the van - der - waals interaction with the interaction energy of about -0.6 ev ,  in contrast with + 1.05 ev from the dft .",
    "thus , the @xmath0be@c@xmath1 complex is stable with respect to decay to @xmath0be and c@xmath1 .",
    "the hf electron density at the beryllium nucleus in be@c@xmath1 exceeds the one in metallic be by 2% in qualitative agreement with the relative difference of the corresponding @xmath0be ec decay rates measured by ohtsuki et.al . as well as with the dft calculations .",
    "the electron density at the be nucleus in @xmath0be@c@xmath1 also exceeds the one in isolated be atom .",
    "the origin of this increasing is neither the modification of be s 2@xmath2 orbital in c@xmath1 because of the hybridization with the fullerene orbitals nor the repulsive potential wall at the region of the fullerene s atoms .",
    "rather the replacement of the be 2@xmath2 state by 3@xmath2 orbital in the new potential , which is the joint coulomb potential of be atom and the attractive effective potential well generated by the fullerene .",
    "the 3@xmath2 state has additional node at distance @xmath3 from the center .",
    "this node imitates the repulsion between electrons of the be atom and the c@xmath1 cage , which has direct physical analogy in the theory of @xmath4-@xmath4 and @xmath5-@xmath5 nuclear interactions .",
