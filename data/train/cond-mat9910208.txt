    "over the past few years it has been generally agreed that the macroscopic symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in high @xmath6 superconductors is unconventional .",
    "the pairing state is almost certainly @xmath0wave @xcite , either pure @xmath7 or a mixed state such as @xmath8@xcite or @xmath9@xcite , which is predominantly @xmath0wave .",
    "the @xmath0wave pairing state raises many important questions , such as the relationship between the pairing state and the physical properties of the superconductors , and of course , the microscopic origin of the pairing interaction itself .",
    "in particular it becomes interesting to consider the microscopic properties of the interfaces of @xmath0wave symmetry systems .",
    "this is necessary both to understand the physical properties of high @xmath5 materials , and to develop further tests of the pairing state and order parameter .",
    "for example , it has already been shown that at an normal metal to @xmath0wave superconductor ( @xmath10 ) interface there is an extended @xmath3wave component to the order parameter in the region of the interface and that this survives up to a few coherence lengths away from the interface @xcite .",
    "there is also experimental and theoretical evidence for microscopic time reversal symmetry breaking at such interfaces@xcite .",
    "the presence or absence of such subdominant order parameters can , in principle , be used to extract information about the nature of the microscopic pairing interaction .",
    "for example some models will allow both @xmath0 and @xmath3wave pairing , while other models are pair breaking in the @xmath3wave channel .",
    "there has also been a substantial amount of work concerning the effect of @xmath0wave symmetry on the josephson effect @xcite , mesoscopic scattering properties of @xmath11 structures @xcite and tunneling density of states for surfaces of @xmath0wave superconductors @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the self - consistent changes in    .[figone ] ]    the superconducting order parameter near an insulating barrier between two @xmath0wave superconductors , i.e. a @xmath12 interface .",
    "the basic geometry is shown in fig .",
    "1 . we carry out a detailed study of how the interface properties evolve as the strength of the barrier is increased from a small perturbation to a strong tunneling barrier . in this way we can contrast the behaviour of interfaces with little or no tunnel barrier , such as twin boundaries , to interfaces with a strong tunnel barrier , such as tunneling through vacuum or oxygen depleted regions at the surface .",
    "our results may also be relevant as a model of grain boundary junctions in high @xmath5 materials , since gurevich and pashitskii have proposed that these junctions are essentially @xmath12 junctions whose impurity barrier is simply dependent up the angle of the grain boundary@xcite .    in our calculations we will concern ourselves with two scenarios ( i ) where there is no phase difference in the order parameter over the interface ( @xmath1 ) and ( ii ) where there is an imposed phase slip of @xmath13 over the interface ( @xmath2 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figone ] . for both of these scenarios",
    "we focus our attention on the magnitude of the extended @xmath3wave and `` @xmath4wave like '' components of the order parameter in the region of the interface .",
    "there is already a great interest in the role extended @xmath3wave components have to play in the region of twin - boundaries , for example w. belzig , c. bruder and m. sigrist @xcite have studied how the local density of states is modified , as one moves across a twin boundary when the bulk order parameter is @xmath14 and the effect of temperature on these calculations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe briefly the model hamiltonian , and the methodology used to solve the bogoliubov de gennes equation in our system . then in sec .",
    "iii we will describe , in detail , the system of interest and define the different components of the superconducting order parameter which will be relevant . in sec .",
    "iv we present results for a perfect interface , i.e. the limit that the tunnel barrier height is zero .",
    "we note that in this _ clean _ case an order parameter phase change of @xmath2 across the `` interface '' corresponds to a phase slip of @xmath13 in a perfect superconductor .",
    "we establish that this phase slip is a stable soliton like solution of the bogoliubov de gennes equation and we obtain the local density of electronic states in the vicinity of the phase slip .",
    "we then proceed to analyze the different components to the superconducting order parameter at the centre of the phase slip and how these change as we change the temperature of the system . in sec",
    "v we turn our attention to @xmath12 interfaces , calculating the properties of the interface as a function of the tunnel barrier height for both the scenarios @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "finally we conclude with comparisons of the local particle density of states in the region of the interface . using these local particle density of states",
    "we also estimate how the josephson critical current is changed as the tunnel barrier strength is changed .",
    "our starting point is the bogoliubov de gennes ( bdg ) equation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the particle and hole amplitudes on site @xmath18 associated with eigenenergy @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normal part of the tight binding hamiltonian and @xmath22 is the anomalous part , given by the bcs gap function .    in the case of the cuprates we have",
    "@xmath7 pairing on a square two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the simplest model hamiltonian which leads to this pairing state is the non - local attractive hubbard model , @xmath23 where , as usual , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electron creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath18 for spin @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the number operator at site @xmath18 . for simplicity we shall assume that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are limited to nearest neighbors only .",
    "we shall neglect any on - site interactions @xmath30 . also , for simplicity , we neglect retardation in the attractive interaction .    the bdg equation , eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] is easily derived as the appropriate mean field factorization of the hubbard model eq .",
    "[ eq : hubbard ] . the normal part of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq:1a ] , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the chemical potential .",
    "the on - site energy , @xmath33 , includes the bare on - site energy and the normal hartree potential @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the charge density at site @xmath36 .",
    "similarly the self - consistent hopping @xmath37 is the bare hopping plus a hatree - fock exchange term @xmath38 the charge densities @xmath39 and @xmath40 are determined from the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] and are given by @xmath41   \\label{eq:3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all of the _ negative _ eigenvalues @xmath19 only .",
    "the off - diagonal part of the mean field hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq:1a ] is the pairing potential or gap function , @xmath22 .",
    "self - consistently this is determined from @xmath42 where the anomalous density is @xmath43   \\label{eq:5 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and again the sum only includes eigenvalues @xmath19 up to the condensate chemical potential ( @xmath32 ) .    in the case of a bulk square lattice with nearest neighbour attractions @xmath29 and nearest neighbour hopping the solutions to the above set of self - consistent equations are well known .",
    "depending on the band filling and temperature the gap function @xmath22 may be pure @xmath7 , pure extended @xmath3wave or a @xmath44 mixed state @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall work exclusively near half filling where only the pure @xmath0wave state is stable .    to solve the above system of self - consistent equations we employ the recursion method @xcite following exactly the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is a purely real - space calculation , and so it is not necessary to assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for example , in the interface geometry studied in this paper we have two semi - infinite lattices joined at an interface .",
    "the recursion method also gives directly the local density of states , @xmath45 , at any given site , which , as we shall show below , assists in the physical interpretation of the self - consistent numerical results .",
    "in the cuprate superconductors there are a number of important intrinsic weak links , including twin boundaries , low angle grain boundaries , and edge dislocations .",
    "there are also a number of man made interfaces designed for specific applications , including break junctions , high angle grain boundary junctions , ramp junctions , and junctions with electron and ion beam irradiated barrier regions . in separate papers we have investigate simple @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 interfaces@xcite , and examined in detail the behaviour of a @xmath49 high angle grain boundary junction@xcite . in this paper",
    "we seek to examine how the interface properties are modified by the presence of an insulating barrier .",
    "for example the insulating barrier may be caused by oxygen depletion in the region of the interface , as suggested by gurevich and pashitskii in their model of grain boundaries@xcite .    with this motivation",
    ", we shall study in detail the system shown in fig .",
    "[ figone](a ) .",
    "we have two semi - infinite @xmath0wave superconducting regions ( ii ) and ( iii ) which are connected to each other via an interface ( i ) .",
    "we study ( 100 ) oriented interfaces as shown in fig .",
    "[ figone](a ) . in the interface region ( i )",
    "we define the strength of the barrier , @xmath50 , by setting @xmath51 in this region to be finite , compared to the rest of the system where @xmath52 .",
    "this barrier height could physically represent the amount of oxygen depletion at the interface , or the vacuum or insulating barrier width in the case of ( 100 ) surface tunnel junctions .",
    "we shall examine the changes in the interface properties as the barrier height @xmath50 is varied from zero to a large value .",
    "we shall study the josephson energy of the junction by comparing the cases of either zero or @xmath13 phase difference between the bulk order parameters far from the interface .",
    "[ figone](b ) illustrates the case of a @xmath13 phase difference in the @xmath0wave order parameter .",
    "we carry out the calculation by imposing a fixed bulk @xmath0wave order parameter @xmath22 far from the interface , and then self - consistently computing the @xmath22 in the region near to the interface .",
    "typically we perform the self - consistent calculations in a region of width five coherence lengths on either side of the junction , confirming that after this distance the self - consistent parameters have returned to their bulk values .",
    "the self - consistent order parameters @xmath22 are computed for each nearest neighbour bond @xmath53 in the lattice ( @xmath54 ) . however interpreting these results",
    "is simplified if we decompose these @xmath22 into components of different symmetries .",
    "for this reason we define the following four linear combinations at each site @xmath18 , @xmath55 here the sites @xmath56 are the four nearest neighbours of site @xmath18 , say counting clockwise .",
    "the first two combinations are simply @xmath7 and extended @xmath3wave pairing respectively . the second two correspond to components of the @xmath22 which are _ odd _ about site @xmath18 .",
    "for this reason they may be said to be `` @xmath4wave _ like _ '' components of the order parameter .",
    "it is important to note that these components do not truly correspond to @xmath4wave pairing since they are spin singlet not triplet and there is no spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry .",
    "these two terms are more closely related to _ gradients _ of @xmath3 or @xmath0wave order parameters .",
    "they also have some relationship to yang s @xmath57 pairing order parameter@xcite which is a spin singlet order parameter , but one that alternates sign on neighboring lattice sites .",
    "this has also been referred to elsewhere as _ antiferrosuperconductivity_@xcite . here",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 correspond to an alternating non - local order parameter @xmath22 , unlike @xmath57-pairing which corresponds to a staggered @xmath60 on - site gap function .",
    "note that because the system in fig .",
    "[ figone](a ) is perfectly periodic in @xmath61 we shall always have @xmath62 .    for our chosen model parameters",
    "only the @xmath0wave component @xmath63 is non - zero in the bulk far from the interface .",
    "however components of the other types can arise near the interface driven by the local symmetry breaking .",
    "the self - consistent order parameter can also have spontaneous symmetry breaking phase transitions as a function of temperature or chemical potential , for example breaking of time reversal symmetry into an @xmath44 type state .",
    "having outlined in previous sections the method for calculating and analyzing the properties of the order parameter , we now consider the most simple situation : @xmath64 throughout the system . in this case",
    "there is no barrier at all at the interface @xmath65 .",
    "if the bulk phase difference across the system @xmath66 is zero then we obviously have just a simple bulk system everywhere with the bulk @xmath0wave order parameter .    on the other hand if @xmath2 ( fig .  [ figone](b ) ) then we have a _ phase slip _ in the unit cell .",
    "this is the superconducting analogue of a bloch wall separating magnetic domains . by solving the bogoliubov de gennes equations",
    "self - consistently we can calculate the width of the phase slip region and the variation of the order parameter across the phase slip .",
    "[ figtwo ] shows our self - consistently determined order parameters in this phase slip geometry . since all quantities only vary in the @xmath67 direction , we can plot @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xmath70 in the region of the interface ( @xmath71 ) , noting that @xmath72 .",
    "we started the self - consistent calculation by imposing a @xmath0wave order parameter throughout the system , but with a phase change of @xmath13 at @xmath71 .",
    "the solution was then determined self - consistently by iterating the bdg equations starting from this state .",
    "we find that the phase slip is a stable self - consistent solution of the bdg equations .    in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] we can see how the @xmath68 ( solid line ) varies in the region of the interface .",
    "it is clearly a minimum at the interface and quickly reaches it s bulk value , oscillat-    ing as it does @xcite .",
    "the extended @xmath3-wave component @xmath69 ( insert ) is also a minimum at the interface , but it then reaches a maximum close to the interface and then reduces to zero in the bulk . on the other hand",
    "@xmath70 ( dashed line ) has a strong maximum at the interface .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the self - consistent hopping , @xmath73 , in the region of the barrier .",
    "again , considering that each site @xmath18 has four neighbours @xmath56 we can plot the four components @xmath74 as a function of position . changing notation slightly we can think of these as four functions of position , @xmath67 , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) . in fig .",
    "3 the dashed and solid lines show @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively ( the hopping perpendicular to the interface ) and the dotted line is @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , ( the hopping parallel to the interface ) .",
    "the plot shows that in the region of the interface the hopping is modified from its bulk value .",
    "it is this modification of the hopping which helps stabilize the phase slip , this is analogous to the case of conventional local @xmath3wave pairing where modification of the local density in the region of the phase slip enhances its stability @xcite .",
    "the oscillations in the @xmath81 shown in fig .",
    "3 simply correspond to friedel oscillations in the non - local hartree - fock exchange term ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "these oscillations are exactly analogous to the friedel oscillations around an impurity or surface in a normal system , even though there is no _ normal _ barrier @xmath50 here .",
    "the results shown in figs .  [ figtwo ] and [ figthree ] were performed with @xmath83 , the bulk @xmath0wave transition temperature .",
    "we now proceed to examine the temperature dependence . in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted the normalized temperature dependence of @xmath84 ( circles ) and @xmath85 ( crosses ) , these being the @xmath4wave _ like _ order parameter at the interface and the bulk @xmath0wave order parameter respectively . as we can see @xmath84 is a linear function of temperature over a wide range ( from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ) . extrapolating this linear dependence",
    "we can state that @xmath84 would go to zero at a temperature of around    @xmath88 , if it were not coupled to the @xmath0wave order parameter . from fig .",
    "4 we infer from the fact that @xmath84 deviates from a straight line above @xmath89 that it is enhanced above @xmath90 by coupling to the @xmath0wave order parameter .    this unusual temperature dependence of the @xmath4wave like component can be explained by examining the phase diagram for a perfect square tight binding lattice .",
    "it is known that at half filling we have a ground state with a stable @xmath0wave order parameter .",
    "however one can also define a separate @xmath5 for extended @xmath3wave or @xmath4wave states .",
    "near half filling @xmath91 is greater than @xmath92 or @xmath90 and so only the @xmath0wave state occurs in the bulk@xcite .",
    "however if the @xmath0wave and extended @xmath3wave order parameters were suppressed somehow then the system would in principle go superconducting at @xmath90 .",
    "interestingly the @xmath5 for the `` @xmath4wave like '' singlet order parameter @xmath93 is the same as that of true triplet @xmath4wave order parameter , which follows from the identical form of the gap equation in both cases@xcite . in effect",
    "our phase slip has forced @xmath94 and @xmath95 to vanish at @xmath71 .",
    "this allows the intrinsic underlying @xmath4wave state to become apparent .",
    "it would be interesting to test this underlying @xmath4wave state experimentally , for example by tunneling experiments to see whether or not there is a finite gap inside a superconducting phase slip .",
    "if there is such a gap it would show that the pairing mechanism has attractive components for @xmath4wave pairing as well as @xmath0wave .",
    "this would only be true for some specific model pairing interactions , such as our nearest neighbour hubbard model .",
    "having considered the most simple case ( @xmath96 for all sites ) we now focus our attention on what happens if we have a finite tunnel barrier ( @xmath97 ) in region ( i ) of our system ( fig .",
    "[ figone ] ) . in this case",
    "it is also interesting to consider the situation where there is no phase slip over the interface and compare this to the result obtained when there is a phase slip . in this section",
    "we study three different strengths of barrier , where in region ( i ) we have defined @xmath98 .    in fig .",
    "[ figfive ] we compare both @xmath70 and @xmath68 for the cases of ( i ) there is a phase slip across the interface ( solid line ) and ( ii ) when there is no phase slip ( dashed line ) , for @xmath99 . from this figure",
    "we can see that as in the case of no barrier the phase slip means that @xmath100 .",
    "this then , effectively , induces a finite @xmath101 at the interface .",
    "however when there is no phase slip ( dashed lines ) we can see that although the @xmath68 is diminished in the region of the interface it does not go to zero , conversely now , due to the symmetry of the problem , @xmath101 must be zero .",
    "we have also calculated the extended @xmath3wave component to the order parameter in the region of the interface .",
    "we find that the extended @xmath3wave component is a maximum , at the interface , when there is no phase slip and zero when there is a phase slip , similar to fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] .    figs .",
    "[ figsix ] and [ figseven ] show the different components to the order parameter for larger strengths of barrier ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "what we see in these two figures is that as the barrier height is increased the differences between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 cases becomes smaller . in the limit of a very high strength impurity barrier ,",
    "[ figseven ] , there is essentially no difference between the order parameter components whether a phase slip is present or not . fig .",
    "[ figsix ] , however , is more interesting .",
    "we see that when there is no phase slip @xmath68 is reduced in the region of the barrier , and as expected @xmath101 is zero . in the presence of a phase    slip , as in all the other cases , the @xmath103 is zero at the phase slip .",
    "but , unlike figs .",
    "[ figtwo ] and  [ figfive ] , @xmath101 is also zero .",
    "this shows that we have gone through three regimes at the interface .",
    "these being ( i ) , low scattering at the interface where , @xmath103 is finite when there is no phase slip and @xmath101 is finite in the presence of a phase slip , ( ii ) , intermediate scattering at the interface where , @xmath103 is still finite when there is no phase slip but now @xmath101 is zero in the presence of a phase slip and ( iii ) , large scattering at the interface , @xmath103 is now zero when there is no phase slip and @xmath101 is also zero in the presence of a phase slip .    to see the physical origin of these three regimes we study the local particle density of states , @xmath45 , in the region of the interface .",
    "[ figeight ] ,  [ fignine ] ,  [ figten ] and  [ figeleven ] show the density of states @xmath45 for four strengths of barrier , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively . in these four figures",
    "we have plotted both the density of states in the presence of a phase slip , @xmath108 , ( thick solid line ) and in the absence of a phase slip , @xmath109 , ( thin solid line ) .",
    "we also show the densities of states for four values of @xmath67 , the distance from the interface .    in the first case we consider @xmath104 ( fig .  [ figeight ] ) .",
    "the first thing to note is that the density of states in the absence of a phase slip corresponds to the pure bulk lattice @xmath0wave density of states .",
    "this is simply because for @xmath64 and @xmath1 there is no interface .",
    "however the density of states in the presence of a phase slip , @xmath110 does change in as we move away from the interface . comparing @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "we see a dramatic shift in the density of states in the region of the fermi energy .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ figeight](a ) that there is a strong shift of spectral weight from the peaks into the region near the fermi level .",
    "we see that the gradient of the local particle density of states , in the region of @xmath111 is dramatically changed , and the size of the gap , ( the distance between the two peaks ) is strongly reduced in the presence of a phase slip .",
    "moving away from @xmath71 ( figs 8(b),8(c ) and 8(d ) ) we see that these large changes in density of states gradually diminish with @xmath67 until @xmath109 and @xmath110 become nearly identical .",
    "interestingly the energy region near @xmath111 is most strongly affected when @xmath67 is large , corresponding to the long - range nature of the energy states associated with the @xmath0wave gap node@xcite .",
    "there is a very strong contrast between the case @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ figeight ] and the case @xmath99 shown in fig .",
    "[ fignine ] . in fig .",
    "[ fignine ] we see that @xmath109 ( thin solid line ) has no subgap structure at all , and this is quite different to the dramatic subgap structure obtained for @xmath110 .    as we increase the barrier strength to @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ figten ] ) we still see that there is no subgap structure in @xmath109 whereas @xmath110 still has some subgap structure , although this structure is not as dramatic as in fig .",
    "[ fignine ] . in fig .",
    "[ figten ] we have only plotted @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath113 because the @xmath71 density of states is dominated by states well away from the gap region .    in fig .",
    "[ figeleven ] we see that in the presence of a very strong barrier , @xmath114 , @xmath115 suggesting that the two sides to the interface have become effectively decoupled .",
    "also in this limit there is no resonant structure in either @xmath109 or @xmath110 .",
    "finally we estimate the josephson critical current as a function of the barrier height , by determining the josephson energy .",
    "this is defined by    @xmath116    where we estimate the energy difference from the integrated densities of states @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively .",
    "the critical current is approximately proportional to this energy difference , @xmath120 where the constant of proportionality depends on the form of the @xmath121 relationship . in the simple josephson tunneling case @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , but",
    "in general other forms of @xmath121 are possible .",
    "for example we have found that @xmath121 is approximately sawtooth in grain boundary junctions@xcite and there is experimental evidence for non - sine wave behaviour@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figtwelve ] we have plotted the calculated critical current ( @xmath124 ) as a function of the strength of the impurity potential ( @xmath125 ) in region @xmath65 . in this figure",
    "we have normalized the critical current with respect to the critical current when no barrier is present .",
    "what we again observe is consistent with the three different regimes ( i ) , little or no normal scattering at the interface , where there is no sub gab resonant structure but @xmath126 for latexmath:[$|e| <     where there is sub gap resonant structure in @xmath110 but not in @xmath109 and finally ( iii ) , large normal scattering at the interface , where @xmath128 . from this",
    "it is possible to deduce that , as one would expect for a high strength interface barriers , the josephson critical current approaches zero .",
    "the three regimes are visible in the calculated @xmath124 of fig .",
    "[ figtwelve ] : in the first weak decrease in @xmath124 with barrier height , the intermediate regime where there is a strong decrease in @xmath124 , and in the strong scattering regime where @xmath129 .",
    ".[figtwelve ] ]",
    "in this paper we have investigated the properties of a @xmath0wave order parameter in the region of a ( 100 ) interface between two @xmath7 superconductors .",
    "we have determined how the barrier height at the interface influences the local density of states and josephson current .",
    "in particular we could identify three distinct regimes with qualitatively different behaviour , corresponding to weak , intermediate and strong barriers , respectively .",
    "we have also calculated the subdominant extended @xmath3wave , and @xmath4wave like order parameter components at the interface . in particular we have shown that the @xmath4wave component has a temperature dependence which reveals the underlying bulk @xmath5 for @xmath4wave pairing , even though this is normally hidden by the higher bulk @xmath0wave @xmath5 . in principle a tunneling experiment could be carried out to test whether or not this @xmath4wave component occurs in real systems .",

    "<S> we consider a model ( 100 ) interface between two @xmath0wave superconductors . by solving the bogoliubov de gennes equation on a tight binding lattice , we study the properties of the interface as a function of the interface barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast the two scenarios : ( i ) an order parameter phase difference of @xmath1 across the interface , and ( ii ) a phase slip of @xmath2 across the interface . </S>",
    "<S> we find resonant sub - gap structure in the density of states only when there is a phase slip present . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the local @xmath3wave and `` @xmath4wave like '' order parameter components are strongly influenced by the barrier profile and by the phase slip . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the local @xmath4wave order parameter follows the underlying bulk @xmath5 for @xmath4wave superconductivity implying that this could be measured by a suitable tunneling experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the josephson critical current as a function of the strength of the insulating barrier at the interface .    2 </S>"
