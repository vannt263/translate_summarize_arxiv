    "the great challenge of string phenomenology is constructing realistic string models which allow us to make unique predictions that can be tested at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , future international linear collider ( ilc ) , and other experiments .",
    "if these predictions are confirmed at future experiments , we will possess strong evidence to support that string theory is indeed the correct fundamental description of nature . to the present",
    ", string phenomenology has been primarily concentrated on heterotic @xmath4 string theory and type ii string theories with d - branes , though unfortunately , this has not resulted in any unique prediction thus far .",
    "the last two years have seen grand unified theories ( guts ) constructed locally in f - theory , which can be considered as the strongly coupled formulation of ten - dimensional type iib string theory with a varying axion - dilaton field @xmath5  @xcite . in f - theory model building ,",
    "the gauge fields reside on the observable seven - branes that wrap a del pezzo @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) surface for the extra four space dimensions , while the standard model ( sm ) fermions and higgs fields are localized on the complex codimension one curves ( two - dimensional real subspaces ) in @xmath7 .",
    "certainly , f - theory model building and phenomenology have been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to d - brane model building  @xcite , all the sm fermion yukawa couplings can be obtained from the triple intersections of the sm fermion and higgs curves .",
    "an exciting new feature is that @xmath0 gauge symmetry can be broken down to the sm gauge symmetry by turning on @xmath2 flux  @xcite , and additionally , the @xmath1 gauge symmetry can be broken down to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 gauge symmetries by turning on the @xmath10 and @xmath3 fluxes , respectively  @xcite .",
    "it is significant to note that realistic guts from f - theory can be constructed locally , hence , the next key question is whether a unique prediction can be made that can tested at the lhc , ilc , and other future experiments .    to study the low energy phenomenology from f - theory guts , gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking",
    "was predominantly considered since the f - theory guts were constructed locally  @xcite .",
    "however , to construct realistic f - theory guts , we must embed these local guts into a globally consistent framework  @xcite .",
    "consequently , here we study gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking . in f - theory @xmath0 and @xmath1 models",
    "where the gauge symmetries are broken down to the @xmath11 and @xmath9 gauge symmetries by turning on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluxes , respectively , we obtain the exact gaugino mass relation ( see eq .",
    "( [ gmrelation ] ) in the following ) near the electroweak scale at one loop .",
    "these f - theory guts are constructed locally , so we do not know the khler potential for the sm fermions and higgs fields . for this reason , we can not calculate the supersymmetry breaking scalar masses and trilinear soft terms .",
    "interestingly , our gaugino mass relation can be preserved very well at the low energy two - loop level if the scalar masses and trilinear soft terms are near the tev scale . using the indices for the gaugino mass relations  @xcite , we show that our gaugino mass relation is different from those that have been studied thus far  @xcite .",
    "because the gaugino masses can be measured at lhc and ilc  @xcite , these f - theory guts can be tested at the colliders .",
    "note that the generic scalar masses and trilinear soft terms will not affect our prediction on the gaugino mass relation at low energy , so we assume a universal scalar mass @xmath12 and universal trilinear soft term @xmath13 for simplicity .",
    "examining two typical scenarios of gaugino masses , we present the viable parameter space which satisfies all the latest experimental constraints and is consistent with the cdms ii experiment  @xcite . in particular , the gaugino mass relation is in fact satisfied at two - loop level with only a very slight deviation at low energy .",
    "more detailed discussions will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in the f - theory guts , the gut gauge symmetries on the observable seven - branes are broken by turning on the @xmath14 fluxes . interestingly",
    ", these @xmath14 fluxes will give additional contribution to the gauge kinetic functions , which can be computed by dimensionally reducing the chern - simons action of the observable seven - branes wrapping on @xmath7 @xmath15 for simplicity , we will assume that the heavy kk states and string states have masses above the gut scale , which can be realize naturally in the global f - theory guts .",
    "first , let us consider the @xmath0 models  @xcite .",
    "turning on the @xmath2 flux , the gauge kinetic functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath2 gauge symmetries at the string scale can be parametrized as follows  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the original gauge kinetic function of @xmath0 , the @xmath5 terms arise from @xmath2 flux contributions , and @xmath23 is a positive integer .",
    "second , let us consider the @xmath1 models . if the @xmath1 gauge symmetry is broken down to the flipped @xmath8 gauge symmetry by turning on the @xmath10 flux  @xcite , we can show that the gauge kinetic functions for @xmath0 and @xmath10 are exactly the same at the unification scale  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if we break the @xmath1 gauge symmetry down to the @xmath9 gauge symmetry by turning on the @xmath3 flux  @xcite , we can show that the gauge kinetic functions for the @xmath19 , @xmath3 , @xmath20 , and @xmath24 gauge symmetries at the string scale are  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath22 is the original gauge kinetic function of @xmath1 , and the @xmath5 term arises from @xmath3 flux contribution .",
    "we can break the @xmath26 gauge symmetry down to @xmath2 at the string scale by the higgs mechanism . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain the gauge kinetic function for @xmath2  @xcite @xmath27    now , let us study gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we can show that the gaugino mass relation in the @xmath1 models with @xmath3 flux is the same as that in the @xmath0 models with @xmath2 flux .",
    "henceforth , we only consider the @xmath0 models with @xmath2 flux here . supposing supersymmetry is broken by the f - terms of @xmath22 and @xmath5 , we can parametrize @xmath28 and @xmath29 as follows @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the gravitino mass if supersymmetry is only broken by the f - terms of @xmath22 and @xmath5 . then , the gaugino masses @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath2 at the gut scale are @xmath35 where @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37    using the one - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) , we obtain the gaugino mass relation around the electroweak scale @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the gauge couplings for the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath2 gauge symmetries , respectively . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we define the index @xmath42 for the gaugino mass relation as follows @xmath43 thus , in the f - theory @xmath0 and @xmath1 models respectively with @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluxes , we obtain that the index for gaugino mass relation is @xmath44 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath45 . moreover , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with anomaly mediation and mirage mediation  @xcite , we can show that the index for gaugino mass relation is @xmath46 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "thus , we emphasize that our gaugino mass relation is different from those in simple anomaly mediation and mirage mediation  @xcite . furthermore , the index for gaugino mass relation in the minimal supergravity ( msugra )  @xcite is not well defined but can be formally written as @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "so the gaugino mass relation in msugra satisfies the above gaugino mass relation in eq .",
    "( [ gmrelation ] ) .",
    "however , if @xmath50 is not very small , our gaugino mass relation can definitely be distinguished from that of msugra",
    ". moreover , the gaugino masses can be measured at the lhc and ilc  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these f - theory guts can be tested at the lhc and ilc , and may be distinguished from the msugra , simple anomaly mediation and mirage mediation  @xcite .    to test the gaugino mass relation close to the electroweak scale ,",
    "we define a parameter @xmath51 as follows @xmath52 notice @xmath51 is exactly one at the gut scale . in addition , @xmath51 is one around the electroweak scale from one - loop rge running , yet @xmath51 may deviate slightly from one as a result of two - loop rge running .    for simplicity , we assume that @xmath36 is small in this work , and then we have approximate gauge coupling unification at the gut scale , allowing us to use well - established public codes for computations . for gaugino masses ,",
    "we consider two typical scenarios    \\(i ) we consider the dilaton dominated scenario , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath53 .",
    "the gaugino masses at the gut scale are @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a mass parameter . in our numerical calculations",

    "\\(ii ) we consider the scenario where @xmath57 is on the order of @xmath58 .",
    "assuming @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we parametrize @xmath57 as follows @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a positive real number .",
    "thus , we obtain the gaugino masses at the gut scale @xmath63 in our numerical calculations , we choose @xmath64 . in summary , we have @xmath65 in scenario i and @xmath66 in scenario ii .",
    "we take @xmath67 , so we have four free parameters in our models : @xmath55 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath68 , where @xmath68 is the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values . the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are input into micromegas 2.0.7  @xcite using suspect 2.34  @xcite as a front end to run the soft terms down to the electroweak scale via rges and then to calculate the corresponding neutralino relic density .",
    "we use a top quark mass of @xmath69 = 173.1 gev  @xcite .",
    "the direct detection cross - sections are calculated using micromegas 2.1  @xcite .",
