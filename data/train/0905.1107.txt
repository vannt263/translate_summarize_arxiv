    "the subject of networks of interacting quantum systems has acquired an important role in the emerging field of quantum information theory . since a realistic quantum logic processor",
    "must ultimately be composed of a large number of interacting quantum systems , it becomes mandatory to understand processes as like as perfect state transfer from one to another system of the network , and even to compute the fidelity of such a state transfer when the action of the environment is taken into account .",
    "a significant amount of result has recently been derived on the subject of perfect state transfer in optical lattices @xcite and networks of spin @xcite and harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "perfect state transfer has also been considered in networks of arbitrary topology and coupling configuration @xcite and even under random fluctuations in the couplings of a quantum chains @xcite .",
    "apart from state transfer , the process of decoherence of a network state has also attracted attention and interesting properties of collective damping effects , as the nonadditivity of decoherence rates , have been discussed in different contexts as in superconducting qubits @xcite , two - atom systems @xcite , and chains of dissipative harmonic oscillators @xcite . still regarding the process of collective decoherence ,",
    "the emergence of decoherence - free subspaces ( dfss ) has also instigated several interesting results when considering the particular case of a composite system interacting with a common reservoir @xcite , or the more realistic situation where each system interacts with its own reservoir @xcite .",
    "we call the attention to the fact that all refs . @xcite envisage such realistic cases of networks where each oscillator interacts with its own reservoir , also addressing the particular case where a common reservoir is considered .    to better understand the results in refs",
    ". @xcite , which are crucial to introduce the subject of the present work , we remember that , apart from the distinct reservoirs , the network of @xmath0 dissipative harmonic oscillators could present direct an indirect dissipative channels . through the direct channels each oscillator loses excitation to its own reservoir , whereas through the indirect channels it loses excitation to all the other reservoirs but to its own . when we consider distinct reservoirs for each network oscillator , the indirect dissipative channels  intrinsically associated with the nonadditivity of decoherence rates and the emergence of dfss @xcite  are significant only in the strong coupling regime where @xmath1 , i.e. , the number of network oscillators @xmath0 multiplied by their coupling strengths @xmath2 are about their natural frequencies @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the strong coupling regime , which brings together the collective damping effects , depends on the number of network oscillators as much as on their coupling strengths . for markovian white noise reservoirs ,",
    "however , where the spectral densities of the reservoirs are invariant over translation in frequency space , the indirect channels becomes null , except for the case @xmath4 @xcite .    in the weak coupling regime where @xmath5",
    ", the indirect channels always disappears .",
    "however , these indirect channels , coming from the strong coupling regime , remains in the case where all network oscillators interacts with a common reservoir @xcite , even assuming a common markovian white noise reservoir .",
    "this is due to the fact that a common reservoir induces an additional correlation between the network oscillators , restoring the indirect decay channels .",
    "recently , a generalization of refs .",
    "@xcite has been presented through a comprehensive treatment of networks of dissipative quantum harmonic oscillators , whichever its topology , i.e. , whichever the _ _  way _ _ the oscillators are coupled together , the _ _  strength _ _ of their couplings and their _ natural frequencies _ @xcite .",
    "focusing on the general more realistic scenario where each oscillator is coupled to its own reservoir , the case where all the network oscillators are coupled to a common reservoir was also addressed . however , after deducing the master equation for the case where all the reservoirs are at finite temperatures , all further analysis of the dynamics of the network states was restricted to the case where the reservoirs are at @xmath6 k. whereas a quantitative analysis of the decoherence and the evolution of the linear entropy of representative states of the network were given at @xmath7 k , only a brief qualitative analysis of the equilibrium states of the network was presented at finite temperatures . in the present manuscript",
    "we extend the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite given a detailed analysis of the temperature effects on networks of dissipative quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "the present extension of ref .",
    "@xcite that accounts for the temperature effects coming from thermal reservoirs is not only interesting due to its more realistic approach but also from the mathematical development here achieved .",
    "in fact , we present an alternative approach to previous results in the literature @xcite regarding the obtainment of the solution of the master equation and the estimation of decoherence times through the wigner distribution function . to circumvent noise effects , many of the nowadays experiments demonstrating quantum logic operations through atom - field interactions occur in cryogenic environments where temperature effects are negligible . in cavity",
    "quantum electrodynamics , the setup is cooled to around 0.5 k by a @xmath8he-@xmath9he refrigerator to avoid blackbody radiation in the high - q superconducting cavity .",
    "under such a specific condition , the temperature effects on the decoherence process are almost negligible . however ,",
    "when the setup is scaled from one single cavity to a network of @xmath0 high - q cavities , major questions arise due to temperature effects .",
    "first of all , would the dfss survive despite the temperature effects ? apart from the special class of states composing the dfss , how the temperature affects other states of the network , as for example initial entangled states ? evidently ,",
    "these questions present no obvious answers , even under the assumption that all network cavities are cooled at low temperatures . on this regard",
    ", we expect that the collective damping effects coming from the indirect dissipative channels to play a major role for the answers to the above questions .",
    "apart from providing the mathematical treatment of the temperature effects on a network of @xmath0 dissipative harmonic oscillators , in the present manuscript we also analyze the role played by temperature on the evolution of particular states of the network other than those composing dfss .",
    "we reserve the analyses of the emergence of dfss under temperature effects to an specific work @xcite where the mechanism of construction of such privileged states is also discussed along with decoherence .",
    "this paper is organized as following : in section ii we revisit our model of a bosonic dissipative network @xcite and present the derivation of the master equation governing the dynamics of the associated density operator . in section",
    "iii we present the solution of the normal ordered characteristic equation obtained from the master equation for the density operator of the network . in section",
    "iv we analyze the evolution of two general classes of initial states of the network , given by mixtures of coherent and number states , through the normal ordered characteristic equation , the glauber - sudarshan @xmath10-function , and the wigner distribution .",

    "<S> a * 76 * , 032101 ( 2007 ) ] to treat quantitatively the effects of reservoirs at finite temperature in a bosonic dissipative network : a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators whichever its topology , i.e. , whichever the _ _  way _ _ the oscillators are coupled together , the _ _  strength _ _ of their couplings and their _ natural frequencies_. starting with the case where distinct reservoirs are considered , each one coupled to a corresponding oscillator , we also analyze the case where a common reservoir is assigned to the whole network . </S>",
    "<S> master equations are derived for both situations and both regimes of weak and strong coupling strengths between the network oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> solutions of these master equations are presented through the normal ordered characteristic function . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a technique to estimate the decoherence time of network states by computing separately the effects of diffusion and the attenuation of the interference terms of the wigner function . a detailed analysis of the diffusion mechanism is also presented through the evolution of the wigner function . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting collective diffusion effects are discussed and applied to the analysis of decoherence of a class of network states . finally , the entropy and the entanglement of a pure bipartite system are discussed . </S>"
