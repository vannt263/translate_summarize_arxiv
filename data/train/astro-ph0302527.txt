    "laboratory and terrestrial gases and liquids are usually well described by incompressible flows ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in contrast , the dynamical behavior of typical astrophysical gases , are characterized by poorly understood highly compressible supersonic turbulent motion ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the large observed linewidths in large molecular clouds show direct evidence for the presence of chaotically oriented velocity fields with magnitudes in excess of the sound speed .",
    "this random motion carries enough kinetic energy to counterbalance and sometimes overcompensate the effects of self - gravity of these clouds @xcite .",
    "the intricate interplay between supersonic turbulence and self - gravity determines the overall dynamical evolution of these clouds and their observable features such as their density structure , the star formation rate within them , and their lifetimes .",
    "thus , it is importance for the description of many astrophysical systems to understand in detail the momentum and heat transfer properties of compressible turbulent gases .",
    "some important clues on the nature and efficiency of mixing associated with the clouds supersonic turbulence can be constrained by the observed metallicity distribution of the stars formed within them . in the pleiades cluster , stars which emerged from the same molecular cloud",
    "have nearly identical metal abundance @xcite .",
    "this astronomical context therefore imposes a strong motivation for a general analysis of the transport and mixing processes in compressible supersonically turbulent media .",
    "analytical and numerical studies of diffusion processes are typically restricted to certain families of statistical processes , like random walk @xcite or remapping models or certain hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "the direct numerical modeling of turbulent physical flows mostly concentrates on incompressible media ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but some studies have been extended into the weakly compressible regime @xcite .",
    "although highly compressible supersonic turbulent flows have been studied in several specific astrophysical contexts @xcite , the diffusion properties of such flows have not been investigated in detail .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to analyze transport phenomena in supersonic compressible turbulent flows and to demonstrate that  analogous to the incompressible case  a simple mixing length description can be found even for strongly supersonic and highly compressible turbulence .",
    "we first briefly recapitulate in section [ sec : formalism ] the taylor formalism for describing the efficiency of turbulent diffusion in subsonic flows . in section [ sec",
    ": num - meth ] we describe the numerical method which we use to integrate the navier - stokes equation . in section [ sec : transport ]",
    "we report the diffusion coefficient obtained in our numerical models , and in section [ sec : mixing ] we introduce an extension of the well known mixing length approach to diffusion into the supersonic compressible regime .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize our results .",

    "it follows that @xmath7 . for fully - developed stationary turbulence",
    ", the initial time @xmath3 can be chosen at random and for simplicity is set to zero in what follows .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 can be associated with the diffusion coefficient @xmath9 as derived for the classical diffusion equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for finding a particle @xmath2 at position @xmath12 at time @xmath13 when it initially was at a location @xmath14 .",
    "this holds if the particle position is a random variable with a gaussian distribution @xcite . in the classical sense",
    ", @xmath15 may correspond to the contaminant density in the medium .",
    "equation [ eqn : diff ] holds for normal diffusion processes and for time scales larger than the typical particles correlation time scale @xmath16 .    in general , however , the lagrangian diffusion coefficient is time dependent and can be defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the lagrangian velocity of the particle .",
    "the diffusion coefficient along one spatial direction , say along the @xmath5-coordinate , follows accordingly as @xmath19 .",
    "equation [ eqn : d(t)-1 ] holds for homogeneous turbulence with zero mean velocity . from @xmath20",
    "it follows that @xmath21 \\cdot \\vec{v}_i(t)\\right \\rangle_i         = 2 \\int_0^t \\langle \\vec{v}_i(t')\\cdot\\vec{v}_i(t ) \\rangle_i dt ' \\;.\\ ] ] the above expression allows us to related @xmath22 to the trace of the lagrangian velocity autocorrelation tensor @xmath23 as @xmath24 a result which was derived by taylor already 1921 @xcite .",
    "this formulation has the advantage that it is fully general and that it allows us to study anomalous diffusion processes .",
    "note , that strictly speaking any transport process with @xmath8 not growing linearly in time is called anomalous diffusion .",
    "this is always the case for time intervals shorter than the correlation time @xmath16 , but sometimes anomalous diffusion can also occur for @xmath25 . if @xmath26 and if @xmath27 transport processes are called _ subdiffusive _ , if @xmath28 they are called _ superdiffusive _ @xcite .",
    "studying transport processes directly in terms of the particle displacement , i.e.  equation [ eqn : def - sigma ] , is useful when attempting to find simple approximations to the diffusion coefficient @xmath22 for example in a mixing length approach .",
    "in order to utilize the above formalism , we carry out a series of numerical simulation of supersonic turbulent flows . a variety of numerical schemes can be used to describe the time evolution of gases and fluids . by far the most widely - used and thoroughly - studied class of methods",
    "is based on the finite difference representations of the equations of hydrodynamics ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the most simple implementation",
    ", the fluid properties are calculated on equidistant spatially fixed grid points in a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "finite difference schemes have well defined mathematical convergence properties , and can be generalized to very complex , time varying , non - equidistant meshes with arbitrary geometrical properties . however , it is very difficult to obtain a lagrangian description , which is essential when dealing with compressible supersonic turbulence with a high degree of vorticity .",
    "methods that do not rely on any kind of mesh representation at all are therefore highly desirable .    for the current investigation we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , which is a fully lagrangian , particle - based method to solve the equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "the fluid is represented by an ensemble of particles , where flow properties and thermodynamic observables are obtained as local averages from a kernel smoothing procedure ( typically based on cubic spline functions ) @xcite .",
    "each particle @xmath2 is characterized by mass @xmath29 , velocity @xmath30 and position @xmath31 and carries in addition density @xmath32 , internal energy @xmath33 or temperature @xmath34 , and pressure @xmath35 .",
    "the sph method is commonly used in the astrophysics community because it can resolve large density contrasts simply by increasing the particle concentration in regions where it is needed .",
    "this versatility is important for handling compressible turbulent flows where density fluctuations will occur at random places and random times .",
    "the same scheme that allows for high spatial resolution in high - density regions , however , delivers only limited spatial resolution in low - density regions .",
    "there , the number density of sph particles is small and thus the volume necessary to obtain a meaningful local average tends to be large .",
    "furthermore , sph requires the introduction of a von  neumann richtmyer artificial viscosity to prevent interparticle penetration , shock fronts are thus smeared out over two to three local smoothing lengths .",
    "altogether , the performance and convergence properties of the method are well understood and tested against analytic models and other numerical schemes , for example in the context of turbulent supersonic astrophysical flows @xcite , and its intrinsic diffusivity is sufficiently low to allow for the current investigation of turbulent diffusion phenomena @xcite .    to simplify the analysis we assume the medium is infinite and isotropic on large scales , and",
    "consider a cubic volume which is subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the medium is described as an ideal gas with an isothermal equation of state , i.e.  pressure @xmath36 relates to the density @xmath37 as @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the speed of sound . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt normalized units , where all physical constants ( like the gas constant ) , total mass @xmath40 , mean density @xmath41 , and the linear size @xmath42 of the cube all are set to unity .",
    "the speed of sound is @xmath43 , hence , the sound crossing time through the cube follows as @xmath44 . in all models discussed here ,",
    "the fluid is represented by an ensemble of @xmath45 sph particles which gives sufficient resolution for the purpose of the current analysis .",
    "supersonic turbulence is known to decay rapidly @xcite .",
    "stationary turbulence in the interstellar medium therefore requires a continuous energy input . to generate and maintain the turbulent flow",
    "we introduce random gaussian forcing fields in a narrow range of wavenumbers such that the total kinetic energy contained in the system remains approximately constant .",
    "we generate the forcing field for each direction separately and simply add up the three contributions .",
    "thus , we excite both , solenoidal as well as compressible modes at the same time .",
    "the typical ratio between the solenoidal and compressible energy component is between 2:1 and 3:1 in the resulting turbulent flow ( see e.g.  figure 8 in @xcite . ) .",
    "we keep the forcing field fixed in space , but adjust its amplitude in order to maintain a constant energy input rate into the system compensating for the energy loss due to dissipation ( for further details on the method see @xcite ) .",
    "this non - local driving scheme allows us to exactly control the ( spatial ) scale which carries the peak of the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "it is this property that motivated our choice of random gaussien fields as driving source . in reality",
    "the forcing of turbulence in the interstellar medium is likely to be a multi - scale phenomenon with appreciable contributions from differential rotation ( i.e.  shear ) in the galctic disk and energy input from supernovae explosions ending the lives of massive stars @xcite .",
    "comparable to the values observed in interstellar gas , we study flows with mach numbers in the range 0.5 to 10 , where we define the mach number from the _ one - dimensional _ rms velocity dispersion @xmath46 as @xmath47 . for each value of the mach number we consider three different cases , one case where turbulence is driven on large scales only ( i.e.  with wavenumbers @xmath48 in the interval @xmath49 ) , intermediate - wavelength turbulence ( @xmath50 ) , and small - scale turbulence ( @xmath51 ) , as summarized in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "note that our models are not subject to global shear because of the adopted periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we call turbulence `` large scale '' when the fourier decomposition of the velocity field is dominated by the largest scales possible for the considered volume @xmath52 , i.e.  the system becomes isotropic and homogeneous only on scales larger than @xmath42 . on scales below @xmath42",
    "it may exhibit a considerable degree of anisotropy .",
    "this is most noticeable in the case @xmath49 , because wavenumber space is very poorly sampled and variance effects become significant .",
    "the system is dominated by one or two large shock fronts that cross through the medium . in the interval",
    "@xmath53 the number of fourier modes contribution to the velocity field is large , and the system appears more isotropic and homogeneous already on distances smaller than @xmath42 .",

    "the velocity field of turbulence that is driven at large wavelengths is found to be dominated by large - scale shocks which are very efficient in sweeping up material , thus creating massive coherent density structures .",
    "the shock passing time is rather long , and shock - generated clumps can travel quite some distance before begin disrupted . on the contrary , when energy is inserted mainly on small scales , the network of interacting shocks is very tightly knit .",

    "one clearly notices markable differences in the density and velocity field between the three models .      in order to drive supersonic turbulence and to maintain a given rms mach number in the flow , we use a random gaussian velocity field with zero mean to ` agitate ' the fluid elements at each timestep .",
    "however , despite the fact that the driving scheme has zero mean , the system is likely to experience a net acceleration and develop an appreciable drift velocity , because of the compressibility of the medium .",

    "the net acceleration is most pronounced when turbulent energy is inserted on the global scales , as in this case larger and more coherent velocity gradients can build up across the volume compared to small - scale turbulence .    the tendency for the zero - mean gaussian driving mechanisms to induce significant center - of - mass drift velocities in highly compressible media can be understood as follows .",
    "suppose the gas is perturbed by one single mode in form of a sine wave .",
    "if the medium is homogeneous and incompressible , equal amounts of mass would be accelerated in the forward as well as in the backward direction .",
    "but , if the medium is inhomogeneous , there would be an imbalance between the two directions and the result would be a net acceleration of the system . if the density distribution remains fixed , this acceleration would be compensated by an equal amount of deceleration after half a period , and the center of mass",

    "@xmath46 stands for @xmath132 , @xmath133 , or @xmath134 in equations [ eqn : d(t)-small - t ] and [ eqn : d(t)-large - t ] , and it hold for the total diffusion coefficient , when using @xmath135 instead .     comparison between mixing length predictions and numerical models . at the left we plot he normalized , mean - motion corrected diffusion coefficient @xmath136 for @xmath137 , and at the right its slope @xmath138 for @xmath139 . for each suite of models , large - scale , intermediate - scale , and small - scale turbulence , respectively ( as indicated by the forcing wavenumber @xmath48 at the top of each plot ) , we separately show the three velocity components ( as indicated at the bottom ) .",
    "the different mach numbers in each model suite are denoted by different symbols ( as identified at the right - hand side of each plot ) .",
    "the dotted lines give the corresponding prediction of the mixing - length theory , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively , where we take @xmath48 to be the maximum wavenumber of the forcing scheme ( indicated at the top of each plot).,width=566 ]    the validity of the mixing length approximation is quantified in figure [ fig : comparison ] which plots the mixing length predictions against the values obtained from the numerical models . for large - scale and intermediate scale turbulence",
    ", the mixing length approach gives very satisfying results , only for small - scale turbulence it underestimates the diffusion strength .",
    "this disparity probably has to do with the numerical resolution of the code , in the sense that driving wavenumbers of @xmath142 come close to the dissipation scale of the method and hence the inertial range of turbulence is limited @xcite .",
    "that limitation leads to an effective driving for the turbulent motion on somewhat larger scales than @xmath143 .",
    "consequently , it leads to a stronger diffusion , i.e.  somewhat larger diffusion coefficients than those predicted by equations [ eqn : scaled - d1 ] and [ eqn : scaled - d2 ] . the same numerical effects also account for the slightly shallower slope of @xmath144 for @xmath91 for models @xmath145 .    figures [ fig : lagrange - d ] and [ fig : comparison ] indicate that the classical mixing length theory can be extended from incompressible ( subsonic ) turbulence into the regime of supersonic turbulence of highly compressible media . in this case , driving length @xmath108 and rms velocity dispersion @xmath146 act as characteristic length and velocity scales in the mixing length approach .",
    "note , that this only applies to mean - motion corrected transport .",
    "in general ( i.e.  in an absolute reference frame ) , supersonic turbulence in compressible media leads to superdiffusion as visualized in figure [ fig : euler - d ] .",
    "we studied diffusion processes in supersonically turbulent , compressible media . to drive turbulence and maintain the desired rms mach number in the flow , we insert energy into the system at a pre - specified rate and over a given spatial scale using random gaussian fields . in our numerical models ,",
    "the adopted magnitude of the rms mach numbers range from @xmath147 to @xmath148 , and turbulence was driven on large , intermediate , and small scales , respectively .",
    "supersonic turbulence in compressible media establishes a complex network of interacting shocks . converging shock fronts",
    "locally generate large density enhancements , diverging flows create voids of low gas density .",
    "the fluctuations in turbulent velocity fields are highly transient , as the random flow that creates local density enhancements can disperse them again .    due to compressibility , supersonically turbulent flows will usually develop noticeable drift velocities , especially when turbulence is driven on large scales , even when it is excited with gaussian fields with zero mean .",
    "this tendency has consequences for the transport properties in an absolute reference frame .",
    "the flow exhibits super - diffusive behavior ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , when the diffusion process is analyzed in a comoving coordinate system , i.e.   when the induced bulk motion is being corrected , the system exhibits normal behavior .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath22 saturates for large time intervals , @xmath75 .    by extending classical mixing length theory into the supersonic regime",
    "we propose a simple description for the diffusion coefficient based on the rms velocity @xmath109 of the flow and the typical shock travel distance @xmath108 , @xmath149    this functional form may be used in those numerical models where knowledge of the mixing properties of turbulent supersonic flows is required , but where these flows can not be adequately resolved .",
    "this is the case , for example , in astrophysical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution , where the chemical enrichment of the interstellar gas and the distribution and spreading of heavy elements produced from massive stars throughout galactic disks needs to be treated without being able to follow the turbulent motion of interstellar gas on small enough scales relevant to star formation @xcite .",
    "our results furthermore are directly relevant for understanding the properties of individual star - forming interstellar gas clouds within the disk of our milky way .",
    "these are dominated by supersonic turbulent motions which can provide support against gravitational collapse on global scales , while at the same time produce localized density enhancements that allow for collapse , and thus stellar birth , on small scales .",
    "the efficiency and timescale of star formation in galactic gas clouds depend on the intricate interplay between their internal gravitational attraction and their turbulent energy content@xcite .",
    "the same is true for the statistical properties of the resulting star clusters .",
    "for example , the element abundances in young stellar clusters are found to be very homogeneous @xcite , implying that the gas out of which these stars formed must be have been chemically well mixed initially .",
    "on the basis of the results discussed here , this observation can be used to constrain astrophysical models of interstellar turbulence in star - forming regions .",
    "understanding transport processes and element mixing in supersonic turbulent flows thus is a prerequisite for gaining deeper insight into the star formation phenomenon in our galaxy .",
