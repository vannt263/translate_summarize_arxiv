    "the analysis of general relativistic binary neutron star processes is an important , yet challenging , endeavor .",
    "the importance of understanding these processes is rooted in observational astronomy , both in gravitational wave astronomy and high - energy electromagnetic wave astronomy .",
    "neutron star binaries could be the central engines for some classes of gamma - ray bursts , and they are definitely strong candidates as sources of gravitational radiation detectable by the up and coming generation of gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , virgo , tama , geo , and lisa .",
    "the challenge of understanding binary neutron star processes is rooted in the complexity of both the nonlinear einstein field equations and the physical properties of the super - nuclear density matter which make up the neutron stars .    due to the complexity of the binary neutron star system , various levels of approximation",
    "have been employed ( with various levels of success ) as aids in understanding the details of the different stages of the inspiral of comparable mass binary neutron stars , from the quasistationary inspiral stage through to the plunge and merger of the binary stars to the ring - down of the final merged object .",
    "these range from the approximation of the structure of the neutron stars themselves ( e.g. , from point particle to finite sized perfect fluid models and the equations of state with different physical approximations ) to the approximation of general relativistic effects ( e.g. , from newtonian gravity , to post - newtonian , to full general relativity ) . based on insights from point particle mechanics in general relativity and orbits of finite size bodies in newtonian gravity",
    ", one expects that the early part of the inspiral process will be quasistationary , with the secular ( i.e. on timescales larger than the orbital timescale ) shrinkage of the orbit driven by gravitational radiation .",
    "when the orbit shrinks to a small enough radius ( but before touching ) , there may or may not exist an innermost stable orbit ( iso ) beyond which dynamical processes drive the quasistationary inspiral into a plunge phase . whether there is , in fact , a `` phase change '' from quasistationary inspiral to a plunge phase in the fully relativistic theory , and whether or not this happens before any other ( hydrodynamical ) dynamical instabilities , is an unsolved problem in full general relativity ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for answers in the newtonian case ) .    a recent approach for the investigation of the later part of the neutron star inspiral which has been studied in detail  @xcite has drawn much attention .",
    "this treatment , which we refer to as the conformally flat quasiequilibrium ( cfqe ) approach , is a procedure for constructing general relativistic configurations that correspond to compact , equal mass binary neutron stars in a quasiequilibrium , circular orbit .",
    "these individual configurations , which we refer to as `` cfqe configurations '' , are by themselves solutions to the constraints of general relativity in 3 + 1 form , i.e. , the hamiltonian and momentum constraints . for a given equation of state , each equal mass binary cfqe configuration can be characterized by two parameters : the separation of the two neutron stars and the baryonic ( rest ) mass of each of the neutron stars ( we only consider equal mass , corotating binary configurations here ) .",
    "taking the cfqe approximation one step further , one can construct an entire 4-dimensional spacetime by `` gluing '' these configurations together as a time sequence of different cfqe configurations .",
    "this construction , which we will refer to as a cfqe - sequence , produces a spacetime that solves 5 of the einstein field equations ( 4 constraint equations and trace of the extrinsic curvature equation )  @xcite .",
    "since the total baryonic mass will be constant during the inspiral , the cfqe approach takes constant baryonic cfqe - sequences as a representation of the evolutionary sequence of the binary neutron star inspiral process ; secular evolution of the orbit due to gravitational radiation brings one equilibrium configuration into another with the same rest mass , forming the cfqe - sequence  @xcite .    in this cfqe - sequence approach",
    ", one finds that for a corotational neutron star binary system ( which is the focus of this paper ) , the adm mass of each of the individual cfqe configurations decreases along a constant rest mass cfqe - sequence as the separation between the binary stars decreases until a minimum is attained , after which the adm mass increases as the separation decreases further . using turning point theorems for exact equilibrium configurations in general relativity  @xcite",
    ", this minimum point signals a secular instability in the evolutionary sequence , and is commonly referred to as the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) configuration . in the newtonian case , it has been shown that this secular instability point is encountered in the evolutionary process _ before _ any dynamical instability is reached  @xcite .    while it is reasonable to assume that the cfqe approximation holds reasonably well for highly separated neutron stars , it is not clear at which point along the evolutionary sequence the cfqe approximation breaks down .",
    "it is certainly not clear whether or not the cfqe - sequence approximation is good for all neutron star separations larger than the isco separation , due to the fact that one main assumption in the turning - point theorems  @xcite used to interpret these cfqe sequences is the assumption of exact equilibrium .",
    "while cfqe configurations are very close to equilibrium for large neutron star separations , they become less so as the separation decreases .",
    "unfortunately , it is exactly the small separation regime , i.e. near the isco configuration , in which these theorems are being applied .",
    "also , the cfqe - sequence approximation to full general relativity does not provide an estimate of the error of its solutions , unlike , e.g. , the post - newtonian approach where one can compute the next order post - newtonian terms to estimate the error of any post - newtonian approximation .    the fact that each cfqe configuration satisfies the constraints of general relativity suggests the use of these configurations as initial data to full general relativistic calculations .",
    "the setting of initial data is obviously an important issue in numerical general relativistic astrophysical simulations .",
    "while all initial data configurations satisfying the constraints of general relativity ( i.e. , the hamiltonian and momentum constraints ) are in principle legitimate initial data sets , they may not be acceptable for the study of coalescence of astrophysical neutron star binaries . in order for the results of the numerical evolutions to be relevant to observations , e.g. , the gravitational waves emitted in actual neutron star coalescences , we have to make sure that the initial data actually corresponds to a configuration in an astrophysically realistic inspiral . it is not straightforward how one can go about evaluating the usefulness of the cfqe approach in approximating astrophysically relevant phenomena .",
    "we note that while the cfqe approach leads to solutions of the constraint equations , the cfqe - sequence approach is _ not _ consistent with the full set of einstein equations .",
    "this paper is divided into four main sections . in section  [ sec : formulation ] , we describe our fully consistent general relativistic hydrodynamics code used in this paper .",
    "we describe in detail the 3 + 1 formulation of the einstein field equations that we couple to the relativistic hydrodynamics equations , along with details of the gauge conditions and discretization techniques used .    in section  [ sec : cfqe ] , we describe the cfqe - sequence approximation , whose individual configurations will be used as initial data for our fully consistent general relativistic calculations .",
    "we demonstrate that the cfqe - sequence definition of the isco for corotating neutron star binaries may not be a relevant concept by showing that if one takes into account the spin energy of the neutron stars when constructing the effective binding energy in the cfqe - sequence approximation , then there is no longer a minimum in the effective binding energy .    in section  [ sec : short_evolve ] , we analyze the key assumptions of the cfqe - sequence approximation by comparing them with fully general relativistic simulations using cfqe configurations as initial data .",
    "we focus on the question of how well the cfqe - sequence approximation for corotating neutron stars approximates full general relativity .",
    "this is done by comparing the assumptions in building the cfqe - sequence to fully consistent general relativistic calculations using cfqe configurations as initial data to our numerical evolution code .",
    "specifically , we analyze the conformal flatness assumption and the assumption of the existence of a killing vector field .",
    "we devise a number of invariant measures of these assumptions , and monitor them in our fully consistent , general relativistic simulations .",
    "we find that , as expected , the accuracy of the cfqe - sequence approximation increases for increasing neutron star separation .",
    "we present a general algorithm for evaluating whether or not any cfqe configuration can be thought of as astrophysically realistic initial data by analyzing how much the cfqe - sequence approximation violates the einstein field equations .",
    "we demonstrate this method by showing that , for any given tolerance , one can find a cfqe configuration whose subsequent evolution in full general relativity will not violate the einstein field equations within a small fraction of an orbit .    in section",
    "[ sec : long_evolve ] , we analyze the long timescale ( i.e. multiple orbits of the binary system ) numerical evolutions of cfqe initial data configurations using our general relativistic hydrodynamics code .",
    "in particular , we use a cfqe configuration which has a @xmath0 larger proper separation than that of the isco cfqe configuration .",
    "we analyze the orbital decay rate on multiple orbit timescales . using care in estimating the numerical truncation error as well as the errors introduced by placing the computational boundaries at a finite distance from the neutron star binaries",
    ", we find that while the computational resources at our disposal are sufficient to get a reasonable handle on the truncation error , the errors introduced by the placement of the boundary of the computational domain can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the neutron star inspiral .",
    "we demonstrate that this is true even if the linear dimensions of the computational domain are as large as one half the size of the gravitational waves being emitted , which is a fairly large computational domain by today s numerical relativity standards .",
    "we conjecture that presently available computational resources will not allow a unigrid finite difference code to decrease the discretization parameter @xmath1 sufficiently and simultaneously increase the distance from the binary system to the computational domain boundary sufficiently in order to guarantee that the induced numerical errors will not significantly affect the details of the inspiral process .",
    "mesh refinement techniques and/or better outer boundary conditions will be needed in order to accurately simulate the physics on the length scales of the compact object as well as the length scales of the gravitational radiation .",
    "our code numerically solves the einstein field equations coupled to a relativistic perfect fluid .",
    "the gravitational degrees of freedom are geometrically encoded in the 4-metric , @xmath2 , which are governed by the einstein field equations @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the einstein tensor and @xmath5 is the stress - energy tensor of the perfect fluid , given as @xmath6 here , we have set the gravitational constant @xmath7 and the speed of light @xmath8 to be identically @xmath9 .",

    "the resolution used in the two studies are comparable . however , in  @xcite , the number of gridpoints across the neutron star was kept fixed .",
    "we , on the other hand , keep ( for each sequence calculated ) the boundary fixed , and thus have different numbers of gridpoints across the star in each sequence .",
    "notice that , as we both increase the resolution and increase the distance from the center of mass to the boundary of the computational domain , the shape of the curves in figure  [ fig : cfqe_seq_data ] remain roughly the same .",
    "in fact , we can perform a richardson extrapolation on our numerical results by fitting each point on the curve to an error function .",
    "for example , we can use the error function @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the numerical value for the binding energy @xmath143 obtained using a specific discretization @xmath1 and coordinate distance from the center of mass to the outer boundary @xmath153 ( we use @xmath153 to denote this distance in solving the elliptic equations for the cfqe configurations , and we will use @xmath154 to denote the coordinate distance from the center of mass to the outer boundary of the computational domain used during the dynamical evolutions . of course , we always have @xmath155 . ) .",
    "note that the first nonzero term for the expansion of the boundary error does not contain a @xmath156 term .",

    "the cfqe - sequence approximation thus predicts a secular instability at this orbital separation , at which point the evolution of the system will change from quasistationary into a plunge phase , where the neutron stars would merge on timescales of the orbital period .",
    "several types of arguments have been used to support this claim  @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", it is intuitively clear that , in the presence of a dissipation mechanism ( gravitational waves are slowly dissipating the binding energy of the binary system ) , if the binding energy would increase with decreasing separation , this would energetically be an unstable situation .",
    "there are also turning point theorems  @xcite in full nonlinear general relativity which state that if a sequence of equilibrium configurations attain a minimum in the adm mass - energy , then this equilibrium configuration is secularly unstable .",
    "hence , to the accuracy of the cfqe - sequence approximation , the minimum in figure  [ fig : cfqe_richard ] is often referred to as the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) configuration .",
    "one problem with the view that these cfqe - sequences somehow approximate fully consistent solutions to the einstein equations coupled to the relativistic hydrodynamic equations has to do with the spin of the the individual neutron stars .",
    "note that in each of the cfqe configurations , the 4-velocity of the fluid is assumed proportional to the timelike helical killing vector field .",
    "the neutron stars are thus spinning at the exact same frequency as the orbital frequency , @xmath104 .",
    "the neutron stars are said to be corotating with the orbital motion .",
    "however , it has been known for some time that realistic binary neutron stars can not be tidally locked during the late stages of inspiral ( i.e. , less than 1000 orbits until the final plunge )  @xcite .",
    "this raises a question : if a cfqe configuration is used as initial data , should we expect the subsequent solution to the einstein equations to follow the cfqe - sequence approximation , and keep the stars tidally locked as the stars slowly inspiral ? in light of the results of  @xcite , the answer must be no . to first order , we would expect the stars to retain approximately the same spin during the dynamical evolutions as is given in the cfqe configuration that was used as initial data .",
    "the resolution of this first question presents a second : what is the status of the isco ? if the stars do _ not _ , in fact , stay tidally locked during dynamical evolution , will this affect the location and/or existence of a turning point in the binding energy curve , i.e. the cfqe isco configuration ?",
    "one can gain insight into this question by comparing the spin kinetic energy of relativistic , uniformly rotating neutron stars to the energy scales involved in calculating the binding energy , eq .",

    "we do this by computing fully consistent general relativistic evolutions numerically using cfqe configurations as initial data , and comparing the resulting solution of the einstein field equations with the spacetime obtained by the cfqe approximation .",

    "recall that the cfqe - sequence approximation is done in a maximally sliced @xmath166 coordinate system . in order to facilitate a meaningful comparison between the fully general relativistic calculation and the cfqe - sequence approach , we adopt this slicing condition for all numerical computations done in this section .",

    "however , one must be careful when trying to apply physical intuition to numerical results that are not in the convergence regime . in this case ,",

    "this makes it even more difficult to try to do a richardson extrapolation type of error analysis in realistic compact object simulations in numerical relativity .",
    "while it should be expected that the extraction of gravitational radiation for a numerically generated spacetime could be highly sensitive to the location of the outer boundary ( see  @xcite ) , there have been , up to now , no results showing what effect the outer boundary conditions can have on the details of the orbits of compact binaries on timescales larger than one orbital period . here",
    ", we see that the dynamical outer boundary conditions can , and do , significantly affect the orbital parameters of compact binaries during numerical evolution .",
    "to date , the only fully general relativistic simulations of corotating binary , @xmath123 polytropes is  @xcite .",
    "the study in  @xcite differs from the present study in several important ways .",
    "one basic difference is that while we focus on the capability of simulating astrophysical realistic neutron star binaries , @xcite focuses on the dynamics of the final merger of the two neutron stars .",
    "thus , the initial data used in  @xcite are cfqe configurations either at isco separation , or closer than isco separation ( isco separation here means simply the neutron star separation of the unique configuration that corresponds to a minimum of the binding energy in the constant rest mass cfqe - sequence , e.g. , in figure  [ fig : cfqe_richard ] ) .",
    "also , in the study  @xcite , it was found necessary to manually decrease the orbital angular momentum of each cfqe configuration at the level of several percent , in order to precipitate the binary merger more quickly .",
    "complementary to that approach , we are trying to use numerical relativity as a tool to assess the fidelity of the cfqe - sequence approximation itself .",
    "we found that in order to perform simulations of the neutron star binary systems compatible with realistic astrophysical scenarios , one must perform simulations using initial data at a distance considerably larger than the isco separation when using corotating cfqe configurations as initial data .",
    "we have outlined a generic method for analyzing the regime of validity of the cfqe - sequence approximation and have applied this method to the case of equal mass , corotating binary neutron stars .",
    "we have found that , for corotating neutron stars , the violation of the timelike helical killing vector field existence assumption was an order of magnitude larger than the violation of the assumption of conformal flatness . specifically , we have demonstrated that initial data specified by a cfqe configuration with neutron stars having an initial geodesic separation of less than @xmath207 ( which is slightly more than @xmath208 neutron star radii , or roughly twice the isco configuration separation ) would produce a solution to the einstein field equations that violates the killing vector field assumption by more than @xmath9 part in @xmath209 ; the conformal flatness assumption would be violated by more than @xmath9 part in @xmath210 .",
    "we thus conclude that , in the corotating case , the cfqe - sequence approximation for neutron star separations of @xmath207 and less violates the einstein field equations at a level larger than @xmath211 , and thus numerical simulations starting with similar cfqe configurations as initial data can not , therefore , be considered as approximating a realistic neutron star binary inspiral .",
    "we note that the violations of the assumptions of the cfqe - sequence approximation that we observe in our general relativistic calculations for the corotating binary systems occur on timescales that are two orders of magnitude shorter than the orbital timescale .",
    "we suspect that this may be due to interactions between the spin assumption of the individual neutron stars ( the corotating assumption ) and the cfqe assumptions .",
    "we have shown that the characteristic shape of the effective binding energy curve within the cfqe approximation is highly sensitive to the spin kinetic energy of the individual neutron stars .",
    "we have shown that if we subtract out the spin kinetic energy of the neutron stars in the construction of the effective binding energy ( which approximates the case where the neutron star spin does not increase as the orbital angular velocity increases ) , then the resulting binding energy curve will have no minimum , and thus the cfqe - sequence approximation would not predict the existence of an isco configuration . we speculate that specifying neutron stars with irrotational spin states in the cfqe - sequence approximation may yield a smaller violation of the einstein field equations for a fixed neutron star separation . the analysis we have developed in this paper can be used for a detailed investigation of this effect .",
    "more interestingly , the analysis we have developed might provide a way to determine a spin state most consistent with the cfqe approximations , and hence provide a more realistic set of initial data that can be used to start simulations at a smaller initial separations .",
    "we have shown that , for our specific neutron star models , we require a resolution of approximately @xmath212 in order to adequately resolve the neutron stars ( `` adequately resolve '' here refers to verifying that we are in the convergence regime through an appropriate richardson extrapolation technique ; this is a much more stringent condition than has been typically used in numerical relativity studies to date involving neutron stars and black holes ) .",
    "this resolution scale is over three orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic wavelength of the gravitational radiation emitted during the last five to ten orbits of the neutron star inspiral process .",
    "we have also shown that the location of the outer boundary of the computational domain can have a significant impact on the details of the evolution of the compact objects on timescales of the orbital period .",
    "specifically , we have seen that changing the linear dimensions of our computational domain from @xmath213 to @xmath214 can significantly impact the dynamics of binary neutron stars during the first several orbits .",
    "this should serve as a warning to the numerical relativity community studying simulations of compact binaries with the hope of extracting gravitational wave information : not only will the outer boundary inhibit the actual process of extracting the gravitational waves , but they also directly affect the sources of the gravitational waves themselves . while our dynamical boundary conditions are not the best choice , and a more consistent treatment , e.g. constraint preserving boundary conditions , would most likely improve the situation , it may be that numerical relativists will be forced to push the outer boundary of the computational domain to the `` local wave zone '' ( which in this case means @xmath215 ) in order to provide realistic gravitational waveforms suitable for use as templates in gravitational wave detectors .",
    "unfortunately , this makes the numerical study of orbiting compact objects in numerical relativity particularly hard .",
    "note that every time we increase the resolution in our 3d simulations by a factor of two , keeping the outer boundary @xmath154 fixed , we must use 16 times the amount of computational resources to perform any particular simulation .",
    "also , every time we increase the outer boundary distance @xmath154 by a factor of two , we must use 8 times the amount of computational resources . therefore ,",
    "if we wanted to simultaneously increase both the resolution and the outer boundary distance by a factor of 2 , we would require over two orders of magnitude more computational resources . while we have shown in this paper that it is possible to track the details of finite sized compact objects in full numerical relativity , what remains is to be able to do so in such a way that all of the numerical errors ( both truncation and boundary errors ) can be demonstrated to be small over a timescale of several orbital periods .",
    "this will be an extremely challenging task , given the current level of computational resources available .",
    "it may be necessary to employ mesh refinement in order to accurately simulate all of the physical degrees of freedom that we are interested in .",
