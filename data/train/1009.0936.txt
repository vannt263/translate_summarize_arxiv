    "static vacuum spacetimes satisfying the einstein field equations play a central role in general relativity , since such spacetimes are expected to represent a final state of the evolution of matter under self - gravitating forces .",
    "several classical results show that , under certain physical conditions , a very limited number of such spacetimes exists .",
    "we are interested here in the class of spatially compact spacetimes with positive cosmological constant , which is not covered by the mathematical techniques available in the literature and , therefore , we establish here a new black hole uniqueness theorem .",
    "our proof overcomes several conceptual and technical difficulties , as explained below .    by definition ,",
    "static spacetime with maximal compact spacelike slices _ ( of class @xmath0 ) is a time - oriented , @xmath1-dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath2 with global topology @xmath3 and lorentzian metric @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a coordinate on @xmath6 increasing toward the future , @xmath7 is a connected , orientable , smooth topological @xmath8-manifold with smooth boundary @xmath9 such that @xmath10 is compact and is endowed with a @xmath5-independent riemannian metric @xmath11 of class @xmath12 , and @xmath13 belongs to the sobolev space @xmath12 and vanishes at the boundary .",
    "the assumed regularity means that , in an atlas of local coordinates , the metric coefficients admit derivatives up to second - order that are squared - integrable . in this context , @xmath14 is referred to as the _ lapse function _ , and the vector field @xmath15 is a future - oriented , timelike killing field : @xmath16 by definition , the hypersurfaces @xmath17const .",
    "are orthogonal to @xmath18 , and the spacetime @xmath2 is foliated by compact spacelike slices with boundary .",
    "the lapse function is positive in @xmath7 and vanishes on @xmath9 , so that the zero - level set of @xmath14 @xmath19 referred to as the _ horizon _ , coincides with the boundary of the slices @xmath20 ( which need not be connected ) .",
    "in addition , we impose that @xmath2 satisfies einstein s vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes einstein s curvature tensor ( in dimensions @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 the ricci curvature , and @xmath26 the scalar curvature , respectively .",
    "in other words , we impose @xmath27    such a spacetime was discovered by kottler @xcite , and its most relevant part for us is the `` interior domain of communication '' , defined as follows . given @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 ,",
    "the _ interior domain of the kottler spacetime , _ denoted by @xmath30 with metric @xmath31 , is the static spacetime with maximal compact spacelike slices , whose lapse function @xmath32 and riemannian metric @xmath33 on the compact spacelike slices @xmath34 are defined by @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the canonical metric on the unit sphere @xmath37 , @xmath38 is interpreted as the mass of the spacetime , and @xmath39 are the two positive roots of the cubic polynomial @xmath40 .",
    "these manifolds are also called _ schwarzschild - de  sitter spacetimes _ and provide us with a two - parameter family of static spacetimes with compact spacelike slices , which are locally ( but not globally ) conformally flat . note",
    "that the horizon of a kottler spacetime , denoted here by @xmath41 , consists of the two connected components @xmath42 we point out that the spacetimes @xmath30 may be extended beyond their horizon : one component of @xmath41 is an `` inner horizon '' connecting to an interior black hole region while the other component is a cosmological horizon connecting to a non - compact exterior domain of communication ( asymptotic to de  sitter ) .",
    "the interior domain is , both mathematically and physically , the region of interest and for instance , as @xmath43 , converges to the outer communication domain of the schwarzschild spacetime dealt with in the classical black hole theorems .",
    "finally , one more family of spacetimes are relevant in the present work , that is , the _ de  sitter spacetimes , _ parametrized by their cosmological constant @xmath21 .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 one domain of communication of the de sitter spacetime , whose spacelike slices have the topology of a half - sphere @xmath45 and whose horizon @xmath46 admits a single component diffeomorphic to the @xmath47-sphere @xmath37 .",
    "we are now in a position to state our ridigity results , under the regularity condition that the level set achieving the maximum of the lapse function is a regular surface .",
    ".25 cm    [ main ] the interior domain of the kottler spacetimes @xmath48 parameterized by their mass @xmath49 and cosmological constant @xmath21 together with the domain of communication @xmath44 of the de  sitter spacetimes are , up to global isometries , the unique static spacetimes with maximal compact spacelike slices and regular maximal level set , satisfying einstein s field equations with positive cosmological constant .    .25 cm    we emphasize that no restriction is assumed a  priori on the topology of the spacelike slices , and this topology is finally identified as part of the conclusion of the theorem , which also provides us with the metric .",
    "hence , the above theorem is of interest in both general relativity and topology .",
    "a large literature is available on black hole uniqueness theorems , and we will not try to review it here but will only quote works that are most related to the present discussion .",
    "classical works deal with the case @xmath50 , and goes back to israel @xcite , hawking @xcite , and many others . for more recent works , see lindblom @xcite and beig and simon @xcite .",
    "the class of ( vacuum ) spacetimes with negative cosmological constant @xmath51 was tackled only recently .",
    "( see @xcite for references . )    in contrast with the above results and despite active research on the subject in the past twenty years , the class of spacetimes with positive cosmological constant is not amenable to the mathematical techniques developed in the existing literature .",
    "our purpose in the present paper is to introduce a new approach which overcomes these ( technical and conceptual ) difficulties and to establish a uniqueness theorem for the case @xmath52 .",
    "as we will show , we have to combine arguments from partial differential equations and differential geometry , and , most importantly , to work within a class of possibly singular foliations .",
    "our method of proof also applies in the riemannian setting and allows us to establish the validity of besse conjecture @xcite .",
    "( see also the earlier works @xcite for special cases . )",
    ".25 cm    all compact three - manifolds @xmath53 , on which there exists a non - trivial solution @xmath14 to the dual linearized curvature equation @xmath54 with regular maximal level set , are given by the following list ( up to isometries ) :    * the sphere @xmath45 endowed with the canonical metric . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the riemannian distance to a point @xmath57 , and the kernel of @xmath58 has dimension @xmath59 . * a finite quotient of the product @xmath60 endowed with the canonical product metric . in this case one",
    "has @xmath61 .",
    "* a finite quotient of the twisted product @xmath60 endowed with the metric @xmath62 .",
    "these twisted products depend upon two real parameters and an integer parameter , and @xmath63 .    .25 cm",
    "let us indicate several key elements of our proof of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "we consider a static spacetime @xmath2 with maximal compact spacelike slices @xmath7 ( and @xmath64 regularity ) satisfying einstein s field equations with positive cosmological constant @xmath21 . using the @xmath1-splitting ,",
    "the einstein equations on the @xmath65-dimensional spacetime are equivalent to a problem posed on the @xmath8-manifold @xmath7 with boundary , i.e. , to the partial differential equations ( for the lapse function @xmath14 and metric @xmath11 ) @xmath66 with the additional constraint that the scalar curvature @xmath67 of @xmath68 coincides with ) the cosmological constant and , therefore , is a constant ; specifically , one has @xmath69 in the einstein equations , the field of @xmath70-forms @xmath71 is the differential of @xmath14 , while @xmath72 denotes the covariant derivative in @xmath68 , @xmath73 the hessian of @xmath14 , @xmath74 the laplacian operator ( normalized to have negative eigenvalues ) , and @xmath75 the @xmath8-dimensional ricci curvature , respectively . by taking the trace of the einstein equations",
    ", we deduce that @xmath76 in other words , @xmath14 is an eigenfunction of the laplace operator defined on the ( unknown ) riemannian manifold @xmath68 .",
    "our objective is to determine _ all triplets of solutions _",
    "@xmath77 satisfying the einstein equations and , in particular , to determine the topology of @xmath7 .    from the lapse function associated with the natural @xmath1foliation of the spacetimes under consideration ,",
    "we define a ( possibly ) degenerate @xmath78foliation and investigate the topology and geometry of its leaves .",
    "it is convenient to introduce certain _ normalized _ geometric invariants of this foliation , which make sense globally on the manifold @xmath7 , even at points where the gradient @xmath79 vanishes ( and the foliation possibly becomes degenerate .",
    "we also introduce the _ hawking mass density , _ defined from the gauss curvature and mean - curvature of the @xmath47-slices , which again makes sense globally on the manifold , even at critical points .",
    "the hawking mass density , used here , appears classically as an integrant in hawking s original definition . using the notion of hawking mass density ,",
    "we establish a pointwise version of penrose inequality on the horizon , which allows us to identify a topological @xmath47-sphere within the connected components of the horizon . an `` optimal '' kottler model with well - chosen adm mass",
    "is introduced , which covers the region limited by certain level sets of the lapse function .",
    "finally , several maximum principle arguments are developed for einstein s field equations of static spacetimes , which apply to the possibly degenerate @xmath78-foliation under consideration .",
    "for further details we refer to @xcite ."
