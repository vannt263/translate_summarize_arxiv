    "this article addresses the question of which random reflectors can be approximated by piecewise smooth surfaces that reflect light according to the classical rule of specular reflection which says that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence .",
    "one of the basic results on billiards says that a certain measure on the space of pairs consisting of location and angle of reflection is preserved by every reflecting surface ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.35 ) ) . our main result , theorem [ m16.2 ] , shows that , except for this universal restriction that applies to all reflecting surfaces , one can approximate in a weak sense every random reflector by a sequence of specularly ( deterministically ) reflecting surfaces .",
    "a special case of this theorem is that one can approximate every _",
    "reflector that preserves the appropriate measure , including , for example , the reflector that reverses the direction of each incoming ray . to see how counterintuitive this is ,",
    "imagine a higher dimensional analog of this reflector : a mirror that appears entirely the color of the observer s eyeball , because the only light rays traveling from the mirror to the eyeball are those that bounced off of the eyeball before reaching the mirror .",
    "this striking effect is implemented in practice with limited accuracy ( for theoretical and practical reasons ) in `` retroreflectors '' ( see @xcite ) and reflective paint ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are several sources of inspiration for our project .",
    "the article @xcite studies reflected brownian motion with inert drift . in a follow up project , z .- q .",
    "chen and the second author plan to study the limiting situation when the diffusion coefficient of reflected brownian motion goes to zero .",
    "it appears that in the limit , the particle will move along straight lines with a random angle of reflection .",
    "the physics literature on random reflections is quite rich .",
    "we will not review it here ; an excellent review can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "some early mathematical articles that considered random reflections were @xcite , and more recent ones include @xcite .",
    "many of these articles are concerned with the so called knudsen reflection law .",
    "knudsen proposed the cosine reflection law , in which the direction of the reflected molecule has a rotation - invariant distribution around the surface normal , with density proportional to the cosine of the angle with the normal , independent of the incidence direction .",
    "knudsen s law is a model for gas dynamics .",
    "the same law is known as lambert s cosine law in optics ( see @xcite , pp .  147 - 148 or @xcite , chap .  6 )",
    ".    on the technical side , our results seem to be related , at least at the intuitive level , to the `` digital sundial '' theorem proved by falconer ( @xcite , thm .",
    "6.9 ) . roughly speaking",
    ", falconer s theorem says that there exists a set with prescribed projections in almost all directions .",
    "although our article is close to the literature on billiards at the technical level , we will use the language of optics because our model is much closer to this circle of ideas at the intuitive level .",
    "we will state our results in a rigorous way in section [ main ] .",
    "section [ sec : det ] contains short proofs of the most elementary results .",
    "the proof of our main result , theorem [ m16.2 ] , is a multistage construction presented in sections [ trans]-[sec : cantor ] .",
    "for a very detailed and careful presentation of the billiards model in the plane see chap .  2 of @xcite .",
    "we will be concerned with mirrors ( walls of billiard tables ) of very special shape .",
    "they are supposed to model macroscopically flat but rough reflecting surfaces .",
    "the paper of feres @xcite contains a rigorous mathematical presentation of this physical phenomenon and detailed analysis of its fundamental properties .",
    "our setup is slightly different from that in @xcite .    consider the following assumptions about a planar set @xmath0 .",

    "<S> we consider two - dimensional optics ( a.k.a .  billiards ) and show that _ every _ random reflector on a line that satisfies a necessary measure - preservation condition ( well established in the theory of billiards ) can be approximated by deterministic reflectors in this way .        </S>",
