    "recently , chiral symmetry breaking in the maximal abelian field and in its monopole - part has been examined on su(2 ) lattice at finite temperature by one of the present authors . @xcite it has been found that chiral condensates ( in quench level ) in the u@xmath0 field and in its monopole part , keep the same feature of chiral breaking with that observed in original su(2 ) gauge field .",
    "existence of light pion in the maximal abelian field has also been reported at zero temperature.@xcite    as for confinement , condensation of monopoles has got increasing evidences .",
    "wriggling of magnetic current in confinement phase@xcite abelian dominance in confinement,@xcite saturation of area law of wilson loops by monopole contribution,@xcite evidence of monopole condensation by entropy dominance over energy of magnetic current @xcite and finiteness of an order parameter in confinement phase@xcite have been reported .",
    "those observations give a support for an idea that monopole condensation is responsible for chiral symmetry breaking as well as confinement .",
    "historically , such idea has been discussed several times .",
    "banks and casher first arged that confinement breaks chiral symmetry in 1980.@xcite later , some authors tried to show chiral symmetry breaking based on dual ginzburg - landau theory.@xcite a recent work by suganuma , sasaki and toki has given an affirmative answer for this possibility.@xcite    here we investigate pseudoscalar boson in the field dominated by monopoles on lattice for a further investigation .",
    "we study relationship between instantons and monopoles also by observing topological charge .",
    "present analyses have been done using intel paragon xp / s(56nodes ) at the institute for numerical simulations and applied mathematics in hiroshima university .",
    "from an su(2 ) gauge field , we extract u@xmath0 field through maximal abelian projection@xcite by maximizing    @xmath1\\ ] ]    and spliting su(2 ) gauge link @xmath2 as    @xmath3 \\times \\left [ \\matrix { e^{i\\theta^{}_{\\mu}(n ) } & 0 \\cr   0 &   e^{-i\\theta^{}_{\\mu}(n ) } } \\right ] , \\eqno[2]\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 . here , @xmath5 is the u@xmath0 gauge field and @xmath6 is interpreted as a charged matter field under the u@xmath0 gauge transformation .",
    "decomposition into the singular(monopole ) and the regular(photon ) parts is carried out following matsubara et al .",
    "@xcite on lattice , every quantity is regular at finite lattice spacing and we can work in landau gauge .",
    "then we have landau gauge field as    @xmath7\\ ] ]    where the abelian field strength @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is lattice coulomb propagator and @xmath11 is derivative on lattice .",
    "here we decompose field strength following degrand - toussaint as,@xcite    @xmath12\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is dirac string .    substituting eq.[4 ] into eq.[3 ] , we have a decomposition of @xmath15 into a regular part @xmath16 and a singular part @xmath17 where    @xmath18\\ ] ]    and    @xmath19\\ ] ]    it is noted that @xmath20 .",
    "such decomposition has been discussed by de forcrand et al.@xcite    as a result of the decomposition , the singular part carrys almost equal number of magnetic currents ( @xmath21 ) to that in the @xmath22 field whereas the number of electric currents is less than a few @xmath23 of that in the @xmath22 field . on the other hand , situation is just opposite in the regular part.@xcite by this reason , the singular part is called as monopole part and the regular part as photon part .",
    "existence of light pseudoscalar boson is examined to confirm chiral broken phase in u@xmath0 and the singular gauge field @xmath24 .",
    "we measure pseudo scalar correlator by staggered quark on @xmath25 lattice at @xmath26 .",
    "the quark operator is given by    @xmath27 , \\eqno[7]\\ ] ]    and @xmath28 is set to be either @xmath2 or @xmath29 or @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "quark mass parameter is taken as @xmath32 and number of configurations is 35 .",
    "results are presented in fig.1 .",
    "the pion correlators in su(2 ) , u@xmath0 and @xmath24 gauge fields have similar shape . local masses in those correlators take similar values .",
    "they are    @xmath33.\\ ] ]    in su(2 ) , u@xmath0 and the monopole part , respectively , at @xmath34 .",
    "although chiral limit ( @xmath35 ) has not been examined , existence of light pseudoscalar meson in those gauge field is confirmed .    on the other hand , that in the regular part @xmath36 behave differently as shown in fig.2 . in order to understand this behavior , we present pseudoscalar correlator of free - staggered fermion in fig.3 . saw tooth like behavior of the correlator in the regular gauge field is similar to that of free staggered quark .",
    "therefore in the regular gauge field , there seems no light pion and no evidence for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "here we report an evidence of strong correlation between instantons and monopoles .",
    "relationship between instantons in nonabelian gauge field and monopoles in its @xmath22 sector has not well clarified .",
    "nevertheless , intimate relation is expected due to several reasons .",
    "both are non - trivial topological objects .",
    "instanton is known to couple with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "actually , we have shown that monopole seems relevant to the breaking in the previous work @xcite and in this paper .",
    "quantities examined here are charge @xmath37 , abolute integral of topological charge density @xmath38 and a normalized action @xmath39 defined by    @xmath40 , \\eqno[9]\\ ] ]    @xmath41| , \\eqno[10]\\ ] ]    @xmath42 ) , \\eqno[11]\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 is a plaquette in @xmath44 -plane .",
    "we evaluate those quantities for the ph - part and the ds - part as well as original su(2 ) link variables with using cooling method .    since , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are those of su(2 ) object , we reconstruct su(2 ) link variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 from @xmath47 and @xmath48 by multipling the matter part @xmath49 in the following way ;    @xmath50 \\times \\left [ \\matrix { e^{i\\theta^{i}_{\\mu}(n ) } & 0 \\cr   0 & e^{-i\\theta^{i}_{\\mu}(n ) } } \\right ] , \\eqno[11]\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 takes either ph or ds .    an sample of 40 configurations , we cool those three fields , @xmath2 , @xmath45,@xmath46 and monitor @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "fig.4a,4b and 4c show typical examples of cooling curves .",
    "although there is quantitative difference , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 of su(2 ) and ds - part have nontrivial plateaus while those of ph - part die very quickly . the trivial feature in ph - part",
    "is common in all 40 configurations . fig.5a and 5b show correlation between topological charges of su(2 ) and ph - part or ds - part at 3 cooling .",
    "6a and 6b are similar one but that at 100 cooling .",
    "we see that a strong correlation between su(2 ) and ds - part while ph - part is trivial and no correlation .",
    "similar features are observed also in @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these suggest that ds - part , i.e. monopole part , is responsible to topological charge and has close connection to instantons .",
    "pseudoscalar correlator is examined in the maximal projected u@xmath0 gauge field and in its decomposed fields .",
    "the correlators in su(2 ) , u@xmath0 and @xmath24 shows similar exponential decay and existence of light pion mode . on the other hand , in the regular part , the correlator behaves as a product of free staggered fermion .",
    "in addition to previous results on chiral condensate at finite temperature @xcite , these results give support for an idea that monopole condensation is also responsible for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we find an evidence of strong correlation between instantons and monopoles .",
    "the field dominated by monopoles carrys topological charge similar to the original su(2 ) field .",
    "on the other hand , the field dominated by photons shows no topological charge .",
    "present results suggest possibility that suitable effective theory of monopole condensation can describe both chiral symmetry breaking of qcd as well as confinement .",
