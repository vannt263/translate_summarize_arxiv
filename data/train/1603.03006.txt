    "the recent availability of computer - algebra tools in particle physics research provides an unique opportunity to perform the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) and next - to - nlo ( nnlo ) standard model ( sm ) calculations with the high degree of precision required by moller and belle ii . here ,",
    "full sm calculations are required , with no approximations at the nlo level , and include leading order nnlo contributions , which can only be achieved with some degree of automatization .",
    "we do this for both moller ( @xmath1 ) and belle ii ( @xmath2 ) , and compare the results of calculations performed with the different sets of renormalization conditions using the on - shell renormalization .",
    "that provides a straightforward test of gauge invariance for the polarization asymmetry .",
    "a discrepancy between sm predictions and experimental measurements would signal the physics beyond the sm .",
    "since moller and belle ii are the most sensitive to the parity - violating ( pv ) interaction , we include u(1)@xmath3 extension of sm with a mass mixing scenario , which results in extension of sm by the parity - violating @xmath0-boson .",
    "our analysis for @xmath0 extends to nlo level giving us a refined set of constrains on the coupling and mass .",
    "first , we start with details on nlo and nnlo ( quadratic ) calculations for moller and then continue with belle ii . in the second part of the paper , we provide results and analysis of the polarization asymmetry with @xmath0-boson present at lo and nlo orders .",
    "we consider two processes , @xmath4 , for moller , and @xmath5 , for belle ii . for moller ,",
    "the most sensitive observable to pv new physics ( aka @xmath0 ) is the polarization asymmetry : @xmath6 in eq.[eq:2 ] , @xmath0 will enter numerator of asymmetry through the interference term . for the @xmath1 process , the asymmetry at lo order given by the following expression : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 , the set of mandelstam variables is used : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the sine of weinberg mixing angle is denoted as @xmath12 . as one can see , the lo asymmetry is proportional to @xmath13 , which results in strong sensitivity to @xmath14 .",
    "this provides an excellent opportunity for the precision measurements of @xmath14 , or , accordingly , the measurement of the weak charge of electron .",
    "although pv asymmetry in eq.[eq:3 ] is quite small , the accuracy of modern experiments exceed the accuracy of the theoretical result at lo order ; the nlo order calculations have been completed by number of authors @xcite .",
    "generally , we can express perturbative expansion ( up to nnlo ) for differential scattering cross - section in orders of @xmath15 as : @xmath16 where matrix elements @xmath17 are related to @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "the first term corresponds to lo , the second to nlo and the third forms nnlo contribution , which comprises from quadratic term ( @xmath20 ) and two - loops ( @xmath21 ) contribution .",
    "the nlo contribution to lo asymmetry is rather big ( @xmath22 ) @xcite , and in order to match 1% moller uncertainty , we calculated a full set nnlo ( quadratic ) @xcite and leading order nnlo ( two - loops ) contributions @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the precision is essential , so we control it in two ways .",
    "first , we applied `` on paper '' on - shell calculations using renormalization conditions of @xcite and low energy approximations @xmath23 ( here @xmath24 ) .",
    "second , we performed semi - automated @xcite calculations for the full set of feynman diagrams without any approximations and using renormalization conditions of @xcite .",
    "this approach was implemented for nlo and nnlo ( quadratic ) contributions .",
    "the semi - automated full two - loop calculations are yet to be completed which is our next goal .",
    "let us demonstrate how these two approaches compare to each other .",
    "first , we introduce a correction to the asymmetry , as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the nlo - corrected asymmetry .     and soft photon cut @xmath27 .",
    "in the left graph , dashed line shows correction due to qed effects , solid line represents weak correction based on semi - automated calculations and dotted line gives `` on - paper '' approximated calculations for the same correction .",
    "right graph shows correction for pure quadratic ( `` q '' ) contribution ( @xmath28 ) , nlo ( `` 1-loop '' ) and nlo+nnlo ( `` 1-loop - q '' ) results .",
    "black dot on both graphs corresponds to the @xmath29.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and soft photon cut @xmath27 . in the left graph , dashed",
    "line shows correction due to qed effects , solid line represents weak correction based on semi - automated calculations and dotted line gives `` on - paper '' approximated calculations for the same correction .",
    "right graph shows correction for pure quadratic ( `` q '' ) contribution ( @xmath28 ) , nlo ( `` 1-loop '' ) and nlo+nnlo ( `` 1-loop - q '' ) results .",
    "black dot on both graphs corresponds to the @xmath29.,title=\"fig : \" ]    if we take @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and kinematics relevant to moller experiment ( @xmath29 ) , we can see in fig.[fig1 ] ( right plot ) that results obtained in both approaches differ less than 0.1% .",
    "we find that the nnlo ( quadratic ) contribution , fig.[fig1 ] ( left plot ) , @xmath33 is responsible for @xmath34 suppression of the total correction at @xmath29 .",
    "this is a clear signal that , in the light of proposed precision experiments , the nnlo contributions are very important .",
    "similar to the moller process , @xmath2 polarization asymmetry ( first addressed in @xcite ) , also shows strong sensitivity to the @xmath14 : @xmath35 we improve the precision by implementing the same two - way approach , for belle ii kinematics specifically , taking into account the full set of nlo electroweak corrections . for @xmath36 ,",

    "however , that result does not include the nnlo contribution , needed to interpret ultra - precision measurements .",
    "the discrepancy between experimental data and sm theoretical predictions would signal new interaction carriers .",
    "we use the simple u(1)@xmath3 extension of sm proposed in @xcite , which uses kinetic type of mixing between dark vector ( @xmath40 ) and hyper - charge ( @xmath41 ) fields : @xmath42 where fields tensors are given by @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the @xmath46 kinetic mixing parameter . with sm higgs doublet plus the higgs singlet ( used for breaking the u(1)@xmath3 symmetry and giving mass to @xmath40 ) ,",
    "a lagrangian describing interaction between the sm fermions and the dark vector boson @xmath40 is :    _ int= & -eq_f|f^f(v_+a_)- +   + & |f(c_v^f^+c_a^f^_5)f ( z_+_za_).[eq:2 - 1 ]    here , @xmath47 is the charge of the fermion in units of @xmath48 , and the @xmath49 and @xmath50 constants are usual sm vector and axial - vector coupling strengths , respectively . as we can see from eq.[eq:2 - 1 ] , the @xmath40 couples to fermions through both parity - conserving and violating terms , which is similar to the weak @xmath51 coupling .",
    "that type of the @xmath40 in @xcite is called the dark @xmath52-boson and derived from an additional mass mixing term characterized by mixing parameter @xmath53 . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the the mass of the dark @xmath52-boson and @xmath55 is an arbitrary model - dependent parameter .",
    "the fact what @xmath56 is represented as a superposition of mixings between dark vector with electromagnetic and @xmath57-boson fields makes it possible to include @xmath56 at nlo level .",
    "we include @xmath56 at nlo in order to match nlo calculations for our sm predictions .",

    "we take @xmath58.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig.[fig3 ] , we explore a scenario of the small mixing @xmath45 and small @xmath56 mass , for moller specifically .",
    "we show up - to-1% deviation from the sm central prediction exclusion plots for @xmath56 , which is included at lo and nlo orders .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath56 at nlo order systematically increase exclusion region for @xmath45 for all masses of @xmath56 by about 25% .",
    "while this increase is not substantial , it could become an important factor in the determination of @xmath56 mass and coupling if @xmath56 is discovered . according to @xcite ,",
    "if no @xmath56 is discovered , moller will exclude the region where @xmath56 is used to explain @xmath59 anomaly . for belle ii ( right plot of fig.[fig3 ] ) , we concentrate on the resonance region at @xmath36 , where sensitivity of belle ii to the @xmath56 ( up to nlo order ) is the highest and is complimentary to the moller experiment . for the @xmath60 process",
    ", we also study the dependence of the asymmetry on the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath61 and @xmath54 , which is shown in fig.[fig4 ] ( top two plots ) .",
    "if we take mass of @xmath0 ( @xmath62 ) , close to the @xmath36 , the sensitivity of the asymmetry is the highest for @xmath63 . in case of the fixed value for kinetic mixing , @xmath64 , the sensitivity of the asymmetry to the variations of @xmath54 is very weak except for the narrow region of resonance around @xmath36 .",
    "this is because the leading @xmath54 dependence in asymmetry is determined by the ratio between kinetic mixing term @xmath61 and denominator of @xmath0 propagator @xmath65 . in @xmath66-channel ( moller ) , at @xmath67 , the asymmetry is proportional to @xmath68 , and for light @xmath56-boson it has a rather high sensitivity to @xmath54 . in s - channel ( belle ii ) , we get @xmath69 , and for the @xmath70 ( light @xmath0 ) the sensitivity is rather low .",
    "if we take @xmath71 ( heavy @xmath0 ) , an overall contribution to the asymmetry due to @xmath0 is suppressed so the effect of new physics becomes negligible . as a result , for belle",
    "ii , if mass of @xmath72 is around @xmath36 , the sensitivity of that experiment to @xmath54 will be substantial . in fig.[fig4 ] ( bottom , center ) , we show the overall dependence of asymmetry on the centre - of - mass energy . here",
    ", we choose @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and it is evident that @xmath0-peak ( if compared to @xmath57-peak ) is suppressed , which is due to the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath0-peak is relatively small , but , with the precision proposed by belle ii , it should be clearly detectable .",
