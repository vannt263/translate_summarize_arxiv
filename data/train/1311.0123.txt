    "since the discovery of the spin - seebeck effect @xcite , according to which a thermal gradient in a ferromagnet generates a spin current , the emerging field of spin - caloritronics @xcite has been the object of intense investigations .",
    "a related line of research , that was developed independently in the recent years , focuses on heat transport in lattices of nonlinear oscillators @xcite .",
    "the relevance of such studies to condensed - matter problems is testifyied by the growing interest for heat transport properties of low - dimensional materials like nanotubes @xcite or graphene @xcite .",
    "further motivations come from the perspective of controlling nanoscale energy flows @xcite as well as from the hope of finding novel dynamical mechanisms that could enhance the efficiency of thermoelectric energy conversion  @xcite .    within this general background , in the present work , we investigate theoretically a system that could be the building block of novel magnonic devices , allowing the propagation of energy and magnetization currents in one direction only .",
    "the system consists of two coupled macrospins connected to thermal reservoirs at different temperatures .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated by means of micromagnetic simulations that such a system can indeed act a spin - seebeck diode @xcite .",
    "the basic functioning principle is similar to the one of the thermal diode considered in the recently born field of phononics @xcite .",
    "it can be qualitatively explained in terms of a temperature - dependent renormalization of the macrospins frequency spectra whose overlap may lead to a conducting or nonconducting state depending on the sign of the applied thermal gradient .",
    "however , such thermo - magnonic system offers several new possibilities for control of nanoscale energy flows @xcite .",
    "the most evident one is related to the fact that we are here dealing with _ two coupled currents _ of the basic conserved quantities , energy and magnetization .    to get a theoretical insight we study here an effective simplified model consisting of two coupled oscillators interacting with external reservoirs .",
    "this will allow to put on a more clear basis the basic operating principles of the system .",
    "in particular , we will argue that the rectification effect can be described as _ stochastic phase synchronization _",
    "( sps ) @xcite of the two precessing spins .",
    "sps occurs in a large class of nonlinear oscillator driven by noise .",
    "it basically amounts to the fact that noise can lead to an enhanced phase entrainment and thus to an increase of the energy transfer among the oscilllators .",
    "this phenomenon , which has attracted large interest in the past decade in connection with biomedical systems and neural circuits @xcite , has never been investigated in the broad context of nanoscale energy transfer and in particular in magnonics and spin - caloritronics .",
    "such novel interpretation , that will be pursued in the present work , is useful to ease the physical intuition and to suggest a new mechanism for the transfer of energy and spin currents in those systems .",
    "the present study answer a very general question , that is , under which condition the transfer of energy an magnetization between coupled spins at different temperatures occurs .",
    "the rectification effect considered here has several applications .",
    "in particular , it opens the way to the experimental realization of thermal logic gates , which have been recently described theoretically within the field of nanophononics @xcite .",
    "this could be the starting point of a new generation of energy efficient electronic devices .",
    "moreover , we suggests to implement this new diode using a very common and well known spintronics device , the spin valve .",
    "we wish to point that , the studies on the spin - seebeck effect on spin - valve systems performed so far , concern only the spin current carried by electrons .",
    "the notion of magnetization current developed here , which is a special case of the usual spin - wave current , has not been investigated so far in this kind of systems .",
    "then , spintronics experiments are challenging for the intrinsic difficulty of measuring the spin current , which is based on the inverse spin - hall effect @xcite . here",
    ", we suggest a _ direct _ way to detect spin and energy transport , which is based on the overlap of the sw modes of the system .",
    "this can be done using various well known techniques , such as the ferromagnetic resonance force spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the physical system and introduce the effective coupled - oscillator model and its interaction with the thermal reservoirs . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] we discuss the rectification of energy and magnetization currents as a phase - synchronization phenomenon induced by the thermal fluctuations .",
    "some simulations of the oscillators model are thereby described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : coupled ] we consider the case in which the system is driven by both a thermal and magnetization gradient .",
    "the predictions of the models are then tested qualitatively with the micromagnetic simulations of the full magnetization dynamics of the device ( sec .  [",
    "sec : micro ] ) . finally , we close the paper with some overview in the concluding section .",

    "rectification effect _ : when @xmath0 the two frequencies may overlap , giving the two non - zero currents @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath3 the frequencies split , and no net current flows in the system.,width=302 ]    the local dynamics of the magnetization @xmath4 in a ferromagnet is described by the landau - lifshiz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite [ eq : llg ] = -_0_eff+/m_s where @xmath5 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath6 is the adimensional gilbert damping parameters and @xmath7 is the effective field , given by the functional derivative of the gibbs free energy of the system with respect to the magnetization . in our case , the effective field contains the applied , exchange and dipolar fields . the first term at the rhs of eq.([eq : llg ] ) describes the precession of the magnetization around the effective field with frequency @xmath8 , while the second term accounts for energy losses at a rate proportional to the gilbert damping parameter @xmath6 .",
    "it is known that an electrical current with spin polarization @xmath9 exerts a spin transfer torque ( stt ) on the localised magnetic moments of the ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "the effect of stt is described by rescaling the effective field as @xmath10 and by adding to the right hand side of eq.([eq : llg ] ) the term [ eq : st ] = _ 0 ( ) . the terms proportional to @xmath11 is usually called field like component of stt .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath12 , which controls the damping , is the usual slonczewski stt @xcite .",
    "the latter can lead to a steady state precession and to a reversal of the magnetization @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 are proportional to the intensity of the current and to the degree of spin - polarization . in general , they both depend on the geometry of the system and on the microscopic transport properties of the material @xcite . for their computation in realistic devices , several methods",
    "have been developed @xcite . here",
    ", they are considered as free parameters of the model , that can be used to control the rectification effect .",
    "the device considered here , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system]a , consists of a spin - valve nanopillar made of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non - magnetic spacer and coupled by dipolar interaction .",
    "this system , which is the prototype for spintronic devices , has several applications @xcite and constitutes the usual geometry for spin transfer nano oscillators ( stnos ) .",
    "we consider the simple case where both the effective field and the polarization vectors are aligned with the @xmath14 axis , which defines the precession axis of the magnetization . in this case , the non adiabatic stt leads simply to a rescaling of the oscillation frequency .",
    "thus , in our model the relevant physics is described only by the slonczewski stt .",
    "this simplification is quite realistic if we consider the nano - pillar geometry , where it has provided to theoretical descriptions in good agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "whithin the macrospin approximation , the circular precession in the @xmath15-@xmath16 plane of the magnetization vectors of the two disks can be described by two coupled llg equations . in the weakly nonlinear regime , those can be effectively approximated in terms of the complex spin wave ( sw ) amplitudes c_n= of disk @xmath17 @xcite . at this level of description ,",
    "the system dynamics can be thus modeled by the stochastic equations _ 1 & = & ( i-_1)(_1c_1 + 2p_1-h_12c_2)+_1[eq : osc1 ] , + _ 2 & = & ( i-_2)(_2c_2 + 2p_2-h_21c_1)+_2[eq : osc2 ] .",
    "those are the equation of motion of two coupled nonlinear oscillators , whose resonance frequencies @xmath18 depend on the sw power @xmath19 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the analytical expressions for @xmath20 at zero temperature , obtained diagonalizing eqs.([eq : osc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : osc2 ] ) , are given in refs .",
    "the damping rates , which describe energy dissipation towards the environment , are chosen to be @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 here model the effect of stt .",
    "thermal fluctuations are accounted by the stochastic terms @xmath23 , @xmath24 being complex gaussian random variables with unit variance and zero average , and @xmath25 , as prescribed by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to adding a fluctuating therm to the effective field in eq.([eq : llg ] ) .",
    "the coupling term @xmath26 @xcite is the functional derivative @xmath27 of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath28 .",
    "notice that this hamiltonian has a general form that describes also exchange interaction , magnon tunneling between different material and phase locking in stnos arrays @xcite .",
    "the chosen form of the stochastic and dissipative terms insures that , for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the expected canonical distribution @xmath31 is the stationary solution of the the fokker - planck equation associated to eqs.([eq : osc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : osc2 ] ) ( here @xmath32 is the hamiltonian for the isolated system @xcite ) . in this first part of the paper we will focus on the case in which @xmath29 .",
    "the case when @xmath33 , where the system is kept out of equilibrium by stt @xcite , is also of interest and will be discussed in sec [ sec : coupled ] .",
    "it is important to remark that eqs.([eq : osc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : osc2 ] ) hold if the system is dominated by two sw modes , one for each oscillator . in the presence of a texture of the magnetization",
    ", the system contains several sw modes , which depend essentially on the geometry of the system @xcite .",
    "this feature can be described developing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : osc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : osc2 ] ) in the proper sw mode basis , as in refs .",
    "[ ] . in these systems , thermal fluctuation excite all the sw modes of the system and the intrinsic nonlinearity of the llg equation generates an additional coupling between the sw modes .",
    "the latter can originate complex phenomena , such as mode hopping or mode coexistence @xcite .",
    "in many situations , when the dwelling time between different modes is large enough , one can still use eqs.([eq : osc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : osc2 ] ) @xcite . in our case , it is possible to identify clearly the modes that belong to each oscillator , and the micromagnetic simulations reported in sec.v corroborate the single mode picture . in perpendicularly magnetized spin valve nano - pillars with several sw modes , it has been shown that @xcite a sw mode expansion of eqs.([eq : osc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : osc2 ] ) , is sufficient to describe the system properly even in the presence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "in particular , no mode hopping as been observed , even in the presence of thermal gradient @xcite .",
    "let us now introduce the conserved currents of the system .",
    "combining eqs.([eq : osc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : osc2 ] ) with their complex conjugates gives the two conservation equations for the sw power @xcite _ 1 & = & -2_1(p_1 ) p_1 + j^12_m,[eq : consmag1 ] + _ 2 & = & -2_2(p_2 ) p_2 + j^21_m,[eq : consmag2 ] which leads to the definition of the magnetization current in between the two oscillators @xcite :    [ eq : magcur ] j^12_m=2h_12(c_1c_2^ * ) .",
    "notice that eqs.([eq : consmag1 ] ) and ( [ eq : consmag2 ] ) are the conservation equations for the @xmath14 component of the magnetization . for a continuum ferromagnet with exchange stiffness @xmath34 , they leads to the usual definition of sw spin current @xmath35 carried by the exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "the conservation equation for the local energy gives the energy current    [ eq : ecur ] j^12_e=2h_12(_1c_2^ * ) , which describes the transfer of energy between the oscillators .",
    "the computation of those currents is similar to the case of the discrete nonlinear schroedinger equation , see refs .",

    "a full analytical solution is obtained in principle solving the fokker - planck equation associated to eqs.([eq : osc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : osc2 ] ) , in a way similar to ref .

    "the solutions of eqs.([eq : osc_det1]-[eq : osc_phi ] ) are of two types : ( i ) phase running ( desynchronized ) solutions , where the two oscillators have different frequencies and ( ii ) phase - locked ( synchronized ) ones . in case ( i )",
    "the time - averaged currents are zero , and eqs.([eq : osc_det1]-[eq : osc_phi ] ) reduce to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which implies the equipartition relation @xmath43 , for @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the thermostats thermalize each oscillator independently and there is _ no net transfer _ of energy and magnetization between the oscillators .",
