    "the analysis and modeling of financial price time series has a long history @xcite and has attracted considerable interest at an accelerated pace in the last two decades .",
    "technological advances have made it possible to collect and process vast amounts of data . as a result , various stylized facts about the statistics of financial data have been discovered @xcite .",
    "these features are mostly concerned with scaling laws , akin to findings in many systems described by statistical physics . there , scaling behavior arises from the interaction of many units in such a way that a critical state is reached .",
    "thus , one may ask if a financial market , for example , can be modeled based on similar principles . in generic terms",
    ", the building blocks could be many individual agents with suitable mutual interactions .",
    "indeed , lux and marchesi have shown that scaling laws can arise in such a setting @xcite .    when building a microscopic model it is prudent to rely on a theoretical foundation supported by evidence . in the present work",
    ", we will employ two such principles .",
    "first , arbitrage opportunities will be annihilated during the time evolution of the market , though admitting statistical fluctuations .",
    "second , the dynamics of the model will drive it into a self - organized critical state , thus naturally giving rise to scaling behavior .",
    "both aspects have been investigated separately in previous work , see @xcite and @xcite respectively . here , we merge those elements into a microscopic market model , using numerical simulation to study its characteristics .",
    "the next section gives an overview of the model s dynamics and definitions .",
    "following a proposal by ilinski @xcite we define a lattice field theory with a ladder topology as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm1lat ] . in physics terms",
    "there are matter fields @xmath0 defined on sites @xmath1 , where @xmath2 means discretized time , and @xmath3 is a spatial index .",
    "these are represented by filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm1lat ] .",
    "in addition , there are gauge fields @xmath4 which live on links starting at site @xmath5 in temporal @xmath6 or spatial @xmath7 direction . those are represented by arrowed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm1lat ] .    left : illustration of the ladder geometry of the lattice model and the label scheme for the fields .",
    "right : depiction of the gauge invariant elements a , b , c , d used in the action.,width=377 ]    as a model for a financial market , again following @xcite , we interpret the matter field as instances of an account value , in some unit . at @xmath8",
    "it could be a cash account , whereas at @xmath9 the value may be interpreted as the number of shares owned in some financial instrument .",
    "the spatial links @xmath10 , connecting cash and shares , are simply conversion factors between the corresponding units .",
    "temporal links @xmath11 , which connect cash value sites one time step apart , mean interest rate factors . similarly , temporal links @xmath12 , starting from a shares site , carry information about the change in share value one time step apart .",
    "the rationale behind such a model is to describe a market that dynamically evolves independent of the trading units being used .",
    "for example , in comparable markets , the dynamics should not depend on the specific , notably arbitrary , currency unit being used in transactions .",
    "this , at least , is the hypothesis which should apply to markets trading in like instruments .",
    "mathematically , this idea is implemented by a quantum field theory with local gauge invariance . such has been worked out in great detail in the context of financial markets @xcite . in a previous work",
    "we have studied some aspects of those ideas using numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "since the current work is directly building on the latter , we refer the reader to @xcite for the technical details . in particular",
    ", we shall use the nomenclature therein .",
    "however , to keep the presentation self contained , the essential building blocks are discussed in what follows .",
    "the dynamics of the model derives from an action @xmath13 $ ] for the lattice fields that is invariant with respect to local gauge transformations @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is an element of the dilation group @xmath17 , i.e. multiplication by positive real numbers .",
    "those carry out conversions between ( arbitrary ) units .",
    "the action is constructed from the elements depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm1lat ] .",
    "these are the smallest gauge invariant objects that can be assembled from the fields .",
    "the diagram associated with label a is known as the elementary plaquette @xmath18 its value is interpreted as the gain ( or loss ) realized through an arbitrage move @xcite .",
    "the global minimum of the classical action @xmath13 $ ] corresponds to zero arbitrage @xcite .",
    "quantization of the field is done through the usual path integral formalism .",
    "the partition function thus is defined as the functional integral @xmath19[d\\phi ] e^{\\textstyle -\\beta s[\\theta,\\phi,\\bar{\\phi}]}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq05}\\ ] ] in this way stochastic fluctuations about zero arbitrage are allowed .",
    "their magnitude is regulated by the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "diagrams b , c , d are gauge invariant elements of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a unit vector in direction @xmath23 .",
    "diagram c , for example , gives the value of the investment instrument at time @xmath24 divided by its value at @xmath25 , provided we adopt the above interpretation of the fields .",
    "it is a measure for the relative change of the asset value during one time step @xmath26 we also define the related quantity @xmath27 commonly called the ` return ' , indicating a gain ( @xmath28 ) or a loss ( @xmath29 ) at the end of the time step .",
    "the generation of lattice field configurations as implemented in @xcite follows a standard procedure .",
    "based on the action @xmath13 $ ] the field components are updated through a heatbath algorithm @xcite linked to the partition function ( [ eq05 ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( in the time direction ) are imposed on all fields as well . however ,",
    "in contrast to @xcite , the updating strategy is modified in two respects .",
    "first , we do set constraints on the fields that live on the axis @xmath8 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gm1lat ] .",
    "the reasoning here is that we wish to design the model such that the axis describes a cash account subject to accumulating interest .",
    "the interest rate is endogenously determined . even at @xmath30",
    "annually the daily rate factor is @xmath31 and thus hardly distinguishable from one .",
    "as the model is designed to describe a high frequency market , where the time extent @xmath32 translates to typically a day , or so , we wish to set a constraint accordingly . in a gauge model",
    "this is not straightforward , because the meaning of the field components is gauge dependent .",
    "to remedy this situation , gauge fixing is called for . with reference to ( [ eq01]-[eq03 ] ) define a gauge transformation along the axis @xmath8 , @xmath33 with @xmath34 on all other sites being arbitrary .",
    "the gauge transformed fields along the axis , @xmath8 , then are @xmath35 in the last equation we recognize the link variable as the ( gauge invariant ) return ( [ eq06 ] ) of the cash holding during one time step .",
    "we therefore set @xmath36 in our simulation we choose a random start for the lattice fields .",
    "from there , the constraint @xmath37 is then implemented by applying the gauge transformation ( [ eq09 ] ) , and then setting the axis links to one ( [ eq13 ] ) . during the subsequent updating procedure the axis fields @xmath38 and @xmath11 are never changed .",
    "nonetheless , the right - hand side of ( [ eq13 ] ) may differ from one , depending on the interest rate factor desired .",
    "the next step is to run a heatbath algorithm with the lattice action @xmath13 $ ] until equilibrium is reached @xcite .",
    "the lattice field configurations then model a market environment where arbitrage opportunities exist only briefly , subject to fluctuations due to the quantum nature of the fields . in economic terms",
    "this model describes an efficient market .",
    "equilibrium , however , does not seem to be realized in the real world @xcite .",
    "second , subscribing to this paradigm , we introduce a new element which is applied post equilibrium . in @xcite",
    "we have studied a simple model where market instances live along a linear chain in time direction .",
    "the sites carry fields @xmath39 which are directly interpreted as returns , thus having the same meaning as ( [ eq08 ] ) .",
    "there is no gauge field in the simple model .",
    "the key ingredient is an updating algorithm that mimics the popular bak sneppen evolutionary model @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 turned out to be essential to the field dynamics . in the context of @xcite the updating strategy consists in finding the site @xmath41 for which the absolute value of ( [ eq14 ] ) is maximal @xmath42 , and then replace @xmath43 and its neighbors @xmath44 with random numbers .",
    "iterating this process leads to a self - organized critical state and produces price times series , and related statistics , which are almost indistinguishable from those in real markets @xcite .    in view of those results",
    "it seems desirable to replicate this updating strategy within the framework of the gauge model as closely as possible . towards this end",
    ", we still do define the ` fitness ' measure @xmath45 as in ( [ eq14 ] ) , however , the returns are now given by ( [ eq08 ] ) , and ( [ eq07 ] ) .",
    "their composition is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm1bak ] . the updating prescription proceeds with finding the ` signal ' @xmath46 of the field configuration , and the site @xmath41 of its location @xmath47",
    "we then update the three field components @xmath48 , which enter the return @xmath43 , and the two next - neighbor links @xmath49 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gm1bak ] .",
    "note that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are left unchanged . in this way only the three returns @xmath52 are affected .",
    "this strategy most closely resembles the updating prescription used in @xcite .    left : illustration of the returns involved in the ` fitness ' criterion ( [ eq14 ] ) ( left ) , and",
    "the field components subject to updating ( right ) , done at the ` signal ' site @xmath53.,width=264 ]    updating those field components consists in drawing random numbers from certain probability distributions .",
    "we have chosen those based on the lattice action @xmath13 $ ] mentioned above .",
    "heatbath steps using the corresponding boltzmann - like distribution , see ( [ eq05 ] ) , are applied to the various field components .",
    "essentially , the probability distribution for a given field component is given by its local environment .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the fields as @xmath54 then , after a gauge transformation , the probability densities for the gauge fields and the matter fields , respectively , have the form @xmath55 these results are derived in detail in appendix [ sec : a ] . the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 are independent of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the products @xmath60 and @xmath61 are gauge invariant and , together with the parameter @xmath20 , determine the variance of the probability distributions for the field components .",
    "those distributions strongly depend on the local environment at the location of the fields .",
    "now , at each updating step we randomly draw fields @xmath62 , @xmath63 , from ( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "relevant averages considered are @xmath64 updating the fields then is accomplished by replacing @xmath65 by including the parameter @xmath66 we have introduced a novel feature to the updating process . while @xmath67 essentially mirrors the strategy in @xcite , deviations from that value introduce very interesting features to the model",
    ". we will be able to describe a range of different returns distributions and time series , as will be described in the next section .",
    "finally , we apply heatbath updates to the two spatial ( horizontal ) link variables @xmath68 , @xmath63 , which connect to the affected matter fields , see ( [ eq22 ] ) .",
    "these links occur in three elementary plaquettes @xmath69 see ( [ eq04 ] ) , where @xmath70 .",
    "the reason is that updating @xmath71 , as prescribed by ( [ eq21 ] ) , changes the plaquettes ( [ eq23 ] ) and thus upsets the no - arbitrage environment of the lattice fields . updating the above links with the lattice action @xmath13 $ ] rectifies this circumstance .",
    "the simulations were done on a lattice of size @xmath72 with gauge field coupling parameter @xmath73 , and the matter field couplings @xmath74 .",
    "these parameters are the same as in @xcite , with the one asset model @xmath75 .",
    "the number of heatbath update steps was @xmath76 to equilibrate the field from a random start .",
    "final configurations were reached after @xmath77 ` signal ' updates .",

    "we have @xmath78 the updating algorithm , described in sect .",
    "[ sec : update ] , employs symmetric probability distribution functions for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "consequently , the probabilities for realizing a gain @xmath81 and a loss @xmath82 are equal .",
    "thus we define the symmetric link @xmath83 and its lattice average @xmath84 numerically , the value of @xmath85 is particular to a distinct lattice field configuration .",

    "the line curve in fig .  [ fig : lchi ] is a four parameter fit , @xmath90 , to those eight data points with @xmath91+a_4 $ ] .",
    "remarkably , there clearly is a transition region in the , approximate , range @xmath92 . for small values",

    "one crucial aspect of financial markets returns is their volatility , as well as how this volatility evolves over time .",
    "volatility is more relevant today than ever , with large spikes possibly occurring in short periods of time .",
    "financial markets returns generally display volatility ` clusters ' .",
    "these clusters indicate that once the volatility is high , it tends to remain high for a while , and that similarly , once it has come down , it tends to remain low for some time . a convenient and well - accepted way of modeling such characteristics is through the use of the auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( arch ) model pioneered by engle @xcite or through the use of the more encompassing generalized regressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( garch ) model proposed by bollerslev @xcite .",
    "whether working on pricing a derivative product , attempting to hedge an exposure , optimizing a portfolio in a mean - variance framework , or estimating the value - at - risk of a position , the ability to capture and model the stochasticity and the clustering properties of the volatility is paramount .",
    "not doing so can lead to the wrong probability distribution being used , since volatility clusters impact the shape of returns distributions in two important ways .",
    "first , the fact that a period of calm statistically tends to be followed by another period of calm indicates that there will be a fairly large amount of probability mass around the mean ( return ) .",
    "graphically this phenomenon translates into a probability distribution function that is higher than the gaussian one in the vicinity of the mean .",
    "second , the fact that a period of extreme movements statistically tends to be followed by another period of extreme movements indicates that there will be non - negligible amounts of probability mass in the tails areas .",
    "graphically this phenomenon translates into a probability distribution function that is higher than the gaussian one in the vicinity of the tails .",
    "the fairly wide - ranging garch specification models the volatility as both a function of past squared return shocks and of past levels of itself . if both past return shocks and past volatility levels are low , for instance , the odds are that the next volatility levels will remain low",
    ". if past volatility levels are low but recent past return shocks are high , the levels of volatility will likely increase .",
    "if past volatility levels are high but recent past return shocks are low , the levels of volatility will perhaps decrease .",
    "finally , if both past return shocks and past volatility levels are high , the odds are that the next volatility levels will remain high . in a garch(p , q )",
    "specification , the number of lags @xmath135 and @xmath136 allowed for past shocks and past volatility levels are limitless .",
    "however , hansen and lunde @xcite explore the ability of 330 different arch / garch models to capture the features of various financial returns and come to the conclusion that a garch(1,1 ) model performs just as well as the more ` sophisticated ' ones .",
    "our specification for the volatility @xmath137 at time @xmath138 is thus a garch(1,1 ) described by the following equation : @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the one - period lagged squared return shock and one - period lagged variance , respectively .",
    "we simulate 100 lattice time series for two different levels of our tuning parameter @xmath66 . in the first set of simulations , @xmath66 is set equal to a value of @xmath142 while in our second set of simulations , @xmath66 is set equal to a value of @xmath143 .",
    "this allows for the generation of different returns distributions and times series , namely financial markets returns with varying degrees of activity : the set of simulations using a @xmath66 value of @xmath142 reflect a somewhat more volatile market than the set of simulations using a @xmath66 value of @xmath143 .",
    "previous studies have shown that even a simple lattice model @xcite is able to produce returns volatility dynamics displaying some arch / garch effects , and also that it is able to produce returns volatility dynamics that are rather consistent with those of nasdaq historical returns . with the present model",
    ", we are here conducting a more extensive investigation : we estimate garch(1,1 ) fits from a large number of randomly chosen lattice configurations for the purpose of demonstrating the stability , consistency , and flexibility of our lattice model .",

    "we have restricted ourselves to a one - asset model linked to an interest rate account .",
    "the dynamics are based on a gauge invariant lattice action which , when quantized , gives rise to eliminating arbitrage opportunities up to stochastic fluctuations , thus reflecting real market conditions .",

    "an extensive analysis of a very large number of time series features evaluated by a garch(1,1 ) analysis was performed .",
    "it turns out that close to 100% of the lattice model - generated time series give rise to sensible analysis parameters , rendering the model results almost indistinguishable from historical market data .",
    "in particular we could verify this observation across various market conditions and varying returns distributions .",
    "we conclude that the model shows promise as a modeling tool for financial time series and look forward to further development and applications .",

    "we now choose the gauge transformation by requiring the new coefficients to be equal @xmath158 or @xmath159 a solution of ( [ a7 ] ) is @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a real parameter and @xmath162 . ] . on all other sites ,",
