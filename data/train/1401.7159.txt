    "consequently , the crystal symmetry , band structure , and sc pairing symmetry , determine the electronic structure of vortices . among these constraints of symmetry ,",
    "the vortex structures are mainly dominated by magnetic translation invariance , whose generator are crystal momentum and vector potential of magnetic field@xcite",
    ". however , such conventional magnetic translation group defines a magnetic unit cell containing two vortices .",

    "the magnetic translation group describing single vortex was discovered to be a subgroup of direct product of conventional magnetic translation group and gauge transformation group u(1 ) .",

    ", we follow the method given by m. ozaki _ _ et al.__@xcite , in which only single vortex structures are calculated in one magnetic unit cell , so that the calculated results can be classified by irreducible representations of magnetic translation group . the numerical calculations in previous works , as mentioned above@xcite , are mostly carried out for two vortices in one magnetic unit cell .",
    "these vortex states , however , can not be identified by invariant subgroups of magnetic translation group because they belong to the irreducible representations of conventional magnetic translation group .",
    "furthermore , two vortices in one magnetic unit cell are not independent because the induction of interaction between them .",
    "it is well - known that the topological defects in unconventional superconductors and superfluids with certain symmetry breaking behave distinguishably from the conventional singular(hard core ) vortices@xcite .",
    "for instance , a vortex in @xmath14he has a finite amplitude of order parameters in the soft core region whose size is larger than the coherent length , whereas the winding structure is non - trivial .",
    "therefore in our numerical calculation , we concentrate on winding structures of vortices for each orbitals , although the vortices in iron - based superconductors are mostly of hard core feature , and classify the vortex structures of isotropic @xmath1 , anisotropic @xmath1 , and @xmath3 wave pairing symmetries in terms of invariant subgroups of magnetic translation group .",

    "the sc order parameter stemming from the mean - field decoupling of the paired scattering term is expressed as @xmath26 for singlet pairing channel .",
    "the peierls phase@xcite in hopping terms comes from the fact that the lagrangian of electron in a magnetic field contains a dynamical term @xmath27 , which gives rise to the phase accumulation in the propagator of electron describing the hopping process between two lattice sites .",
    "the modification of pairing order parameters accounts for eliminating the mixing of different pairing states under the action of magnetic translation group .",

    "different from the situation for conventional magnetic translation group@xcite @xmath33 : @xmath34 , the group condition of magnetic translation group , which is the symmetry group of abrikosov lattice , is that only single magnetic flux @xmath35 is contained in one magnetic unit cell@xcite , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "it has been pointed out that @xmath3 @xmath37 wave order parameters will mix with extended @xmath38 @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xmath43 wave order parameters under operation of magnetic translation group@xcite .",
    "such a mixing originates from the fact the symmetry group of normal state hamiltonian contains a local gauge transformation generated by the vector potential of a magnetic field .",
    "the re - defined sc gauge transformed order parameters transforming according to invariant subgroups of @xmath17 group without any gauge component , as order parameters do in the absence of magnetic field , are obtained by generating all of them with the action of a conjugate rotation subgroup @xmath44 on one of the pairing bonds of every local order parameters accompanied by a peierls phase factor@xcite .",

    "therefore the mixing of order parameters under magnetic translation is eliminated by re - defining rotations of all local order parameters at different sites back to origin .",

    "<S> we study electronic structure of vortex core states of fese superconductors based on a t@xmath0 three - orbital model by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes(bdg ) equation self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital - resolved vortex core states of different pairing symmetries manifest themselves as distinguishable structures due to different quasi - particle wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained vortices are classified in terms of the invariant subgroups of the symmetry group of the mean - field hamiltonian in the presence of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> isotropic @xmath1 and anisotropic @xmath1 wave vortices have @xmath2 symmetry for each orbital , whereas @xmath3 wave vortices show @xmath4 symmetry for @xmath5 orbitals and @xmath6 symmetry for @xmath7 orbital . in the case of @xmath3 wave vortices , hybridized - pairing between @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals gives rise to a relative phase difference in terms of gauge transformed pairing order parameters between @xmath5 and @xmath7 orbitals , which is essentially caused by a transformation of co - representation of @xmath6 and @xmath4 subgroup . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated local density of states(ldos ) of @xmath3 wave vortices show qualitatively similar pattern with experiment results . </S>",
    "<S> the phase difference of @xmath10 between @xmath5 and @xmath7 orbital - resolved @xmath3 wave vortices can be verified by further experiment observation . </S>"
