    "the signal states are used for the generation of the secure keys whereas the weaker decoy pulses are used to protect the system from potential photon number splitting attacks .",

    ", we use an off - the - shelf diode laser at alice pulsed at 10  mhz , rather than the system clock rate of 1  ghz .",
    "the low pulsing rate allows a much lower clock laser launch power to be used , thus reducing the photon scatter into the quantum channel .",
    "a standard small - form - pluggable receiver at bob detects the received clock before sending it to a frequency synthesizer to regenerate the original 1  ghz system clock at bob .",
    "figure  [ fig : jitter ] shows the resulting timing jitter between alice and bob as a function of bob s received clock power over 80  km of fiber . as the received power is increased , timing jitter gradually decreases . however , there is a trade - off in reduced timing jitter and qkd system performance .",
    "excessive clock laser intensity results in increased photon scattering into the quantum channel raising the qber . on the other hand , insufficient clock laser intensity reduces the effective detection efficiency of the quantum signal due to increased jitter between arriving laser pulses and the detector .",
    "we decide to operate the clock subsystem at -47.6  dbm .",
    "this optical power is approximately 30 times smaller than either data - laser .",
    "the clock laser has thus negligible impact on the quantum channel .",
    "the timing jitter between alice and bob is measured to be approximately 10  ps , a value sufficiently small to drive self - differencing detectors for efficient single - photon detection .",
    "note that these 10  ps include also the contribution from drift in the fiber , and thus represent the worst case for the recovered clock .",
    "measurement at bob s side produces a cycle - cycle jitter of 1  ps throughout the power range used .",
    "this is indeed very low and ideal for driving detectors with the self - differencing technique .      given a data - laser with optical power @xmath14 at a wavelength @xmath15 , its raman - scattered light entering into the quantum receiver can be obtained by integrating over the entire fiber length ( @xmath16 ) @xcite , resulting in @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the forward and backward reconfiguration , respectively .",

    "<S> we demonstrate qkd in the presence of error - free bidirectional gb / s data transfer with a secure bit rate which is over three orders of magnitude higher than previously reported .    the main challenge for the coexistence of quantum and data signals on the same fiber arises from the extreme contrast in their intensities . </S>",

    "<S> although the data - laser signal can be readily filtered using wavelength multiplexing , secondary photons , resulting from its raman and nonlinear interaction with the fiber , are impossible to reject completely because of their spectral overlap with the quantum signal . placing the quantum channel spectrally far away from the data channels can reduce the spectral overlap . </S>",

    "<S> these channels are multiplexed using coarse wavelength division multiplexers ( cwdm ) for transmission through the single fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the cwdms feature an insertion loss of 0.51  db at passbands , centered at 1551 , 1571 , 1591 and 1611  nm . the fiber link is made of dispersion - shifted fiber featuring low chromatic dispersion of 4  ps / nm@xmath2 km and a measured loss of 0.2  db / km at 1550  nm . </S>",
    "<S> standard single - mode fiber can also be used by precompensating fiber dispersion at longer distances ( greater than 50  km ) @xcite . to minimise loss of quantum transmission , the 1551  nm cwdm band </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig : raman](a ) shows a spectrum of back - scattered secondary photons generated by a 1611  nm laser launched into an 80  km fiber at 0  dbm power ( 1  mw ) . </S>",
    "<S> rayleigh scattered photons are approximately 4 orders of magnitude more intense than the raman - scattered photons . </S>",
    "<S> as the rayleigh photons have the same wavelength as the 1611  nm laser , they can be readily rejected from the 1551  nm cwdm passband used by the quantum subsystem , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , raman photons spectrally extend over the 1551  nm passband . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , a considerable fraction of raman photons enter the quantum receiver through the cwdm coupler .    </S>",
    "<S> we have systematically studied how much light is raman - scattered into the 1551  nm passband by other cwdm channels in order to assign the wavelengths for classical communication . </S>",
    "<S> a 1  mw laser signal is launched into the fiber link through one of the remaining cwdm channels at either alice s or bob s side , and we measure the scattered light power in the 1551  nm output of bob s cwdm module . </S>",
    "<S> the measured power quantifies the amount of raman scatter entering the quantum receiver through the 1551  nm channel . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : raman](b ) shows the raman scatter power ( symbols ) as a function of fiber length between alice and bob in 5  km intervals for three different cwdm channels . for each channel the backward scatter ( light launched on bob s side ) and forward scatter ( light launched on alice s side ) are shown , together with the result of a theoretical calculation ( solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation is outlined in appendix c.    forward and backward scatter display a distinctively different behavior with increasing fiber length . </S>",
    "<S> whereas forward scatter reaches a maximum value at a distance of about 20  km before it starts to decline , backward scatter saturates and does not decrease with distance . in the case of forward scatter the accumulation of raman power along the fiber is eventually outstripped by the increasing fiber attenuation , leading to a reduction of raman noise . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , backward scatter travels back to the quantum receiver and is not subjected to higher loss with increasing distance . </S>",
    "<S> hence , backward scatter never decreases but reaches saturation asymptotically .    at each fixed wavelength , the backward raman scatter is always stronger than the forward scatter , and becomes dominant for long fibers . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , for all wavelengths studied , the further the laser is spectrally away from the 1511  nm passband , the weaker the raman scatter . assigning bob s data - laser to the 1611 nm channel </S>",
    "<S> therefore minimizes the raman scatter into the quantum receiver , as this configuration minimizes the amount of back scatter . </S>",
    "<S> the two remaining wavelengths of 1571 and 1591  nm are assigned to alice s lasers . </S>",
    "<S> as the clock laser needs comparably lower launch power ( see appendix b ) , it is preferable to assign the shorter wavelength of 1571  nm to the clock subsystem .    figure  [ fig : noise_power ] compares the combined raman noise caused by both alice s ( 1591  nm ) and bob s ( 1611  nm ) data - lasers with the strength of the quantum signal at a flux of 0.5 photons per pulse at 1  ghz ( thin solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> we omit the contribution of the clock laser because of its low launch power ( see appendix b ) . the raman noise is stronger than the quantum signal for every fiber length , especially for long fibers . at 90  </S>",
    "<S> km , the raman noise is approximately 27  db stronger than the quantum signal . </S>",
    "<S> such a noise level would result in a quantum bit error rate ( qber ) close to 50% , preventing formation of a secure key . to obtain a secure key </S>",
    "<S> , the qber must be below 10% , a typical threshold value for the decoy - state bb84 protocol @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering that other noise sources , such as encoding apparatus imperfections , detector dark counts and afterpulsing , may contribute around 5% to the qber , the raman noise needs to be 10  db weaker than the quantum signal as a practical guideline . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this level as the raman tolerance , as plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noise_power ] .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to temporal - filtering , we employ conventional techniques for the suppression of raman noise . </S>",
    "<S> as the first step , we place a narrow bandpass filter ( nbf ) in front of the quantum receiver , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the filter has a passband of 0.56  nm , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman](a ) . including its intrinsic loss of 0.6  db </S>",
    "<S> , the filter reduces the raman noise by 15  db . </S>",
    "<S> the overall improvement in the snr is 14.4  db . despite the improvement , the raman noise remains considerably stronger than the tolerance for most fiber lengths , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noise_power](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> qkd is possible only over very short lengths ( approximately 3  km ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to lower the launch power of the data - lasers using optical attenuators ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](a ) ) to match the sensitivity of the data photo - receivers . as an example , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman](c ) shows the bit error ratio as a function of receiving power for the 1611  nm data channel . </S>",
    "<S> its sensitivity , defined as the minimum receiving power required to achieve a bit error ratio no higher than @xmath3 , is measured to be -36.8  dbm at a data modulation rate of 1.25  gb / s over a fiber link of 80  km . </S>",
    "<S> taking the fiber loss ( 0.2  db / km ) into account , a launch power much lower than 0  dbm can be used to achieve error - free data communications . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a launch power of -18.5  dbm is more than sufficient for 80  km data transmission . with lower launch powers , the raman noise ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noise_power](c ) ) is reduced considerably .            </S>",
    "<S> applying temporal filtering , a new and crucial technique , to the conventional toolbox discussed above for noise reduction , we can now reduce the raman noise further to below the raman - tolerance threshold for distances up to 100  km . here , we operate ingaas apds using an alternating bias with a repetition frequency of 1  ghz . figure  [ fig : raman](d ) shows the detection efficiency as a function of the detector gate delay under pulsed laser excitation . when the detector and laser are synchronized , the detector exhibits a peak detection efficiency of 20% . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , after delaying the detection gate relative to the laser by 100  ps , the detection efficiency drops sharply to virtually zero . </S>",
    "<S> the full width at the half maximum for each efficiency peak is measured as 100  ps , which is much shorter than the nominal detection window of 500  ps . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the low - noise evolution of avalanches @xcite : only avalanches triggered at the front edge of each gate can grow sufficiently strong to be detected .    </S>",
    "<S> the short active time of 100  ps reduces the impact of the raman noise on qkd remarkably . </S>",
    "<S> the detector is effectively a temporal filter , rejecting those photons arriving outside of the active times . </S>",
    "<S> the random arrival time of raman photons is simulated by breaking the synchronization between the pulsed laser and detector . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman](d ) , the detection efficiency for these randomly arriving photons is now reduced to approximately 2% , which is almost 10 times lower than the peak efficiency for synchronized photons . the efficiency contrast results in a temporal rejection of 9.4  db for the raman photons . </S>",
    "<S> now , the calculation shows the raman noise is tolerable for fiber distances up to 100  km [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the sifted key rate falls off exponentially with fiber length at a rate of approximately 0.20  db / km , which is the characteristic loss of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the secure key rate decreases at the same rate for short fiber distances ( less than 50  km ) . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the secure key rate as 935 and 507 kbit / s over 35  km and 50  km fibers , respectively . increasing the fiber length further , the secure bit rate decreases at a rate noticeably faster than the fiber loss , due to the increased cost of privacy amplification for higher . at 80 and 90  </S>",

    "<S> the simulation is in excellent agreement with the experimental results .    in comparison with previous demonstrations ( table  [ tab : comparison ] ) , the present work has achieved not only a much longer fiber span but also orders of magnitude higher secure key rates . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this advance will have significant impact for future deployment of qkd technology and networks . </S>",
