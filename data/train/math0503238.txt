    "a _ complex reflection group _ on @xmath2 is a finite subgroup @xmath4 of @xmath5 generated by pseudo - reflections .",
    "such groups are characterized by the structure of their invariant ring .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath6 $ ] be the symmetric algebra of @xmath2 and let us denote by @xmath6^w$ ] the algebra of invariants of @xmath4 .",
    "then shephard - todd @xcite and chevalley @xcite proved that @xmath4 is generated by pseudo - reflections if and only if @xmath6^w$ ] is a polynomial ring .",
    "irreducible finite complex reflection groups have been classified by shephard - todd @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is a single infinite family of groups and exactly 34 other  exceptional \" complex reflection groups .",
    "the infinite family @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are positive integers numbers with @xmath9 , consists of the groups of @xmath10 matrices such that :    \\1 ) the entries are either 0 or @xmath11 roots of unity ;    \\2 ) there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column ;    \\3 ) the @xmath12 power of the product of the nonzero entries is 1 .",
    "the classical weyl groups appear as special cases : @xmath13 the symmetric group , @xmath14 the hyperoctahedral group , and @xmath15 the group of even - signed permutations .    through research on complex reflection groups and their braid groups and hecke algebras ,",
    "the fact that complex reflection groups behave like weyl groups has become more and more clear . in particular",
    ", it has been recently discovered that they ( and not only weyl groups ) play a key role in the structure as well as in the representation theory of finite reductive groups . for more information on these results the reader",
    "is advised to consult the survey article of brou @xcite , and the handbook of geck and malle @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to show that complex reflection groups continue to behave like ( classical ) weyl groups also from the point of view of the combinatorial representation theory .",
    "it is well known that , in a way similar to coxeter groups , they have presentations in terms of generators and relations , that can be visualized by dynkin type diagrams ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , their elements can be represented as colored permutations .",
    "in fact , the complex reflection groups @xmath7 can be naturally identified as normal subgroups of index @xmath16 of the wreath product @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the cyclic group of order @xmath19 .",
    "this makes it possible to handle them by purely combinatorial methods .",
    "we follow this approach .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ flag",
    "] , we introduce several combinatorial parameters on complex reflection groups . among those we define the concept of  major index \" and  descent number \" for @xmath7",
    ". then our investigation continues by showing the interplay between these new combinatorial statistics and the representation theory of @xmath7 .",
    "more precisely , in section [ col - des ] we define a new set of @xmath0-modules , which we call _ colored - descent representations_. they generalizes to all groups @xmath0 , the descent representations introduced for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , by adin , brenti , and roichman @xcite .",
    "these modules are isomorphic to the solomon s descent representations in the case of @xmath20 , while they decompose solomon s representations in the case of @xmath21 .",
    "following adin - brenti - roichman s approach , we use the coinvariant algebra as representation space . in order to do that , in section [ col - des - basis ] , we use refined statistics to define an explicit monomial basis for the coinvariant space .",
    "this basis has special properties that allow us to define our new set of modules . in section [ s - decomposition ] ,",
    "the decomposition into irreducibles of the colored - descent representations is provided ( theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "we use a generalization of a formula of stanley ( theorem [ 4.5 ] ) on a specialization of a product of schur functions , proved in section [ s - stanley ] .",
    "it turns out that the multiplicity of any irreducible representations is counted by the cardinality of a particular class of standard young tableaux , called @xmath3-_orbital_. as a corollary of that , we obtain a refinement of a theorem first attributed to stembridge ( corollary [ stembrh ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ identities ] , by using the properties of the colored descent basis , a carlitz type identity ( theorem [ ca - h ] ) relating the major index and descent number with the degrees of @xmath0 will be derived .",
    "it is worth to say , that in a very recent preprint concerning wreath products , baumann and hohlweg @xcite , following solomon s descent algebra approach @xcite , define some special characters of @xmath22 as images through a",
    " generalized solomon homomorphism \" of the elements of a basis of the mantaci - reutenaur algebra @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they do nt provide any module having them as characters .",
    "it was a nice surprise to see that the modules which carry them as characters are our colored - descent representations in the case of @xmath23 .",
    "for our exposition it will be much more convenient to consider wreath products not as groups of complex matrices , but as groups of colored permutations .",
    "let @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 be the field of complex numbers .",
    "for any @xmath27 , we let @xmath28:=\\{1,2,\\ldots , n\\},$ ] and for any @xmath29 we let @xmath30:=\\{a , a+1,\\ldots , b\\}.$ ] let @xmath20 be the symmetric group on @xmath28 $ ] .",

    "this explains the fact that this group is also called the _ group of r - colored permutations_. sometimes we will represent its elements in _ window notation _ as @xmath38 when it is not clear from the context , we will denote @xmath36 by @xmath39 . moreover , if @xmath40 , it will be omitted in the window notation of @xmath41 .",

    "it is clear from the definition that the wreath product is @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , @xmath52 is the symmetric group , @xmath53 is the weyl groups of type @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the dihedral group of order @xmath56 .",
    "the major index is a very well studied statistic over the symmetric group , ( see e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . lately",
    ", many generalizations of this concept have been given for the other classical weyl groups and for wreath products ( see e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . among those statistics ,",
    "it became soon clear that , the flag major index , introduced by adin and roichman on @xmath21 @xcite , is the one more similar to the major index @xcite , regarding the aspect of its implications with the representation theory of the group @xcite .",
    "its analogue for weyl groups of type @xmath54 is the @xmath54-(flag ) major index , introduced in @xcite . in this section",
    "we define a version of the major index for @xmath7 .",
    "we introduce a particular subset of @xmath22 which is in bijective correspondence with @xmath7 , and define there our statistics . in the following sections , it will become clear that this subset is the right object to work with .    in order to lighten the notation , we let @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for any @xmath59 , with @xmath48 let @xmath60 . we define the following subset of @xmath22 , @xmath61 note that @xmath62 is not a subgroup of @xmath63 .",
