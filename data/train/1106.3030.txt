    "type ib supernovae ( sne ) are observationally defined by the absence of hydrogen ( h ) and presence of helium ( he ) in their spectra at early phases .",
    "they are thought to come from massive stars ( m @xmath2 8 m@xmath3 ) which have lost their h envelope , but retained part of their he envelope before exploding .",
    "sne ic show neither h nor he features in their early spectra , and arise from massive stars which have also lost most of their he envelope .",
    "a group of sne that show h features at early phases , but do not follow the typical light curve seen for the h - rich type ii sne , and instead evolve photometrically and spectroscopically into sne ib are known as type iib sne .",
    "these are also thought to come from massive star progenitors which have lost most ( but not all ) of their h envelope before exploding .",
    "sne iib , ib and ic are often collectively termed `` stripped - envelope sne '' @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the apparent lack of h and/or he lines in an early spectrum does not preclude the presence of these elements in the ejecta .",
    "@xcite analysed a large sample of sn ib spectra , and suggested that h is often present also in sne ib , though this element is very difficult to detect after maximum .",
    "they also found that he is often present outside the photosphere ( detached ) , in particular at late phases .",
    "similar studies of sne ic @xcite suggest that traces of h and he may be also present in some sne ic . the presence of he and/or h in some stripped - envelope sne could be an indication that the progenitor has been stripped continuously ( which can leave thin layers of h or he on the progenitor ) as opposed to strong episodic mass loss , which would likely completely strip the progenitor .",
    "furthermore , the small observational differences between he rich ( ib ) and he poor ( ic ) sne may suggest a similar origin , with progenitors of sne ic simply being more strongly stripped than those of sne ib .",
    "an important open issue on sne ib / c is whether they come from relatively high mass wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( m @xmath4 m@xmath3 ) , that have been stripped of h and part of their he envelope by radiatively - driven winds , or from lower mass progenitors ( m @xmath5 11 m@xmath3 ) which have been stripped of their envelope by a binary companion @xcite .",
    "several statistical studies have been performed on the environments of stripped - envelope sne in order to characterise the ib and ic progenitor populations . many have focused on metallicity as a key parameter driving mass loss in single stars and hence determining the relative numbers of types ii , ib and ic sne .",
    "metallicity is also important in binary models @xcite , and influences the number of wr stars produced as well as the predicted ratios of ibc sn .",
    "rotation rates are also thought to be dependent on initial stellar metallicity @xcite .",
    "initial studies of the global properties of host galaxies suggested that the number of sne ic relative to the number of sne ib increases with metallicity @xcite .",
    "however more recent measurements of the nebular oxygen abundances at the sites of sne ib and ic now suggest there is little difference between the samples @xcite . from these results",
    "there is no unambiguous evidence that ibc sne are produced in more metal rich regions than type ii sne , or that ib and ic sne originate in different metallicity regimes .    the relatively high frequency of sne ib / c ( 30 per cent of all core - collapse sne by volume ) and the lack of progenitor detections @xcite supports the idea that at least some of the sne ib / c progenitors are massive stars in binary systems @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the extreme kinetic energies inferred for some stripped - envelope sne , namely those associated with grbs , are indicative of a high - mass progenitor which does not need necessary binarity to lose its envelope .    excluding the extreme cases , for most stripped - envelope sne discriminating between the progenitor scenarios is more tricky . in principle",
    "one may argue that sne which eject more material probably come from more massive stars , while sne with low mass ejecta may come from less massive progenitors in binary systems . on the other hand ,",
    "if fall - back occurs ( where a portion of the sn ejecta falls back on to the newly born compact remnant at the centre ) even very massive stars may eject only a small amount of material .",
    "a detailed analysis of the elemental abundances in the ejecta is then a useful diagnostic .",
    "for example , oxygen and carbon are expected to be more abundant in ejecta of a sn from a massive progenitor , due to the larger progenitor core mass . however , from an observational point of view , the number of stripped - envelope sne with detailed ejecta characterization is still small .",
    "recent discoveries have also pointed out the largely unexplored diversity in he - rich sne , for example the wide range of ejected mass and energy as typified by sn 2007y @xcite and sn 2008d @xcite , respectively , or the case of sn 1999dn , for years considered a prototype of sne ib , but recently proposed to be a highly energetic sn from a massive progenitor @xcite .    in this framework ,",
    "every new nearby sn ib discovered represents an opportunity to increase our understanding of these events .",
    "sn 2009jf , a nearby sn which was discovered early after the explosion , is a perfect target to enlarge the sample of well - studied sne ib .",
    "in this paper we present the full set of data we collected for sn 2009jf , from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to optical and near infrared ( nir ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we describe the set of data collected and its calibration . in section  [ parphot ]",
    "we present the photometric data and in sections  [ parspe ] and [ spenebular ] the optical and nir spectra of sn 2009jf . in section  [ sec : host ] , we discuss the properties of the host galaxy ngc 7479 ( see fig .",

    "@xcite reported the detection of a source close to the position of the sn in several images obtained over the past few decades .",
    "a rough estimate of the absolute magnitude of the source in the pre - discovery images ( @xmath12 mag ) led @xcite to initially suggest a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) as the progenitor of sn 2009jf .",

    "the sn was recovered as soon as it was visible again in june 2010 with observations that extended until october to cover the nebular phase .",
    "we used several of the facilities available to the elp collaboration , and also the five prompt @xcite telescopes used by the mcss project .",

    "more spectra were collected in the nebular phase , when the sn became visible again . in total",
    "we collected 20 optical and 4 infrared spectra of sn 2009jf ( see section [ parspe ] ) .",
    "details of our data reduction methods are reported in appendix [ ap0 ] .      to search for a progenitor in pre - explosion data ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , we queried all suitable publicly available image archives of which we are aware .",
    "the most useful images for constraining the pre - explosion environment and progenitor of sn 2009jf are from the wide - field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on - board the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. the site of sn 2009jf was observed for a total of 2000 s in the @xmath20 filter and 1800 s in the @xmath21 filter on 1995 october 16 .",
    "pre - explosion data were also available from many ground based observatories , but these images , which have a typical seeing of  1 arcsec , are not of sufficient quality to resolve the complex region where the sn exploded ( see section [ parprogenitor ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the _ spitzer _ irac and _ xmm - newton _",
    ".    however , several of these deep pre - explosion ground based images were used as templates for application of the template subtraction technique for our photometry ( see sec .",
    "[ ap0 ] ) .",

    "we used the @xmath26 filter with the s54 camera 56  field of view . ] .",
    "a late time observation was obtained on 2010 september 16 , but the sn had faded in the nir to the point where it was not significantly brighter than the nearby cluster , and so this data was of no use in locating the progenitor .",
    "to constrain the explosion epoch we used the pre - discovery images of ngc 7479 taken by i. eder on september 23rd27th .",
    "the first observation on september 23rd was before the first non - detection of sn 2009jf at the kait telescope @xcite . using these images taken on september 23 as a template , we performed image subtraction on the images taken over the following days ( 24th , 26th and 27th ) with the same telescope .",
    "the sn is marginally detected in @xmath1,@xmath24 and @xmath25 bands on september 26th , while nothing is detected in the same bands on september 24th ( see fig .",
    "[ figexp ] ) .",
    "the detections on september 26th and the non - detections on september 24th , making the reasonable assumption that the object was rapidly brightening before maximum , constrain the explosion epoch to september 25th ( jd=2455099.5 ) @xmath27 day , which is one of the best constrained explosion epochs for a stripped - envelope sn ( not associated with a grb ) .              as shown in fig .",
    "[ figlc ] our photometry is consistent with that of @xcite at early phases , but at later epochs their photometry appears to systematically overestimate the sn flux as compared to our template - subtraction photometry ( see appendix  [ ap0 ] ) .",
    "sn 2009jf is a clear case where proper template subtraction has to be used to avoid the contamination from the bright background .",
    "there is also a shift between our @xmath22-band photometry and that of @xcite , with our photometry being fainter by @xmath28 mag . at late phases the differences are even larger , again probably due to the overestimation of the sn magnitude when using psf - fitting techniques as opposed to template subtraction photometry .",
    "sn 2009jf reached its maximum luminosity on 2009 october 14th at @xmath29 mag in the @xmath1-band .",
    "it peaked 2.4 days earlier in the @xmath22 band and 2.1 , 4.6 , and 5.3 days later in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 bands respectively ( table  [ tabparam ] ) .",
    "the rise times to maximum were @xmath017.5 , 19.9 , 22.0 , 24.5 and 25.2 days respectively in the @xmath18 bands .",
    "this is one of the slowest rise times ever observed for a classical sn ib / c . using a distance modulus of 32.65 @xmath30 0.1 mag and a galactic reddening of @xmath31=0.112 mag @xcite and internal @xmath31=0.05 mag ( see section  [ sec : host ] ) , sn 2009jf reached a maximum absolute magnitude in the @xmath25-band of @xmath32 mag , brighter than sne 2008d ( @xmath33 mag , * ? ? ?",

    "after maximum the light curves of sn 2009jf are not very different from those of other sne ib / c , although with a slower than normally observed decline both soon after maximum and after the inflection point at @xmath030 days past maximum .",
    "the resulting light curve peak for sn 2009jf is broad , suggesting a massive ejecta and/or a small expansion velocity which keeps the ejecta optically thick for a long time .",
    "the late - time luminosity decline rates were computed via weighted linear least - squares fits to the observations and are reported in table  [ tabparam ] together with other key parameters measured from the light curves .",
