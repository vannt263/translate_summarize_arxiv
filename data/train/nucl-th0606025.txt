    "during the last decade two - proton emitters and proton - rich nuclei , in the vicinity of the proton drip - line , are subjects of intensive experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "in particular the study of a candidate to possess a two - proton halo in the ground state , namely the borromean @xmath2ne nucleus is of special experimental and theoretical interest ( see , for example , discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "the inherent feature of the halo structure is a relatively small separation energy of a valence nucleon .",
    "it reveals itself in a large valence nucleon removal cross section and a narrow core longitudinal momentum ( lm ) distribution .    in the case of @xmath2ne",
    "the proton removal cross section , measured at the energy 66 a mev on a be target @xcite , is relatively large compared to the cluster model ( @xmath0o@xmath3 ) predictions @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "the measured core lm distribution is wider than the calculated one .",
    "both these facts can be attributed to contribution of a proton removal from the @xmath0o core in @xmath2ne if this cross section is relatively large .",
    "recently the @xmath1n longitudinal momentum ( lm ) distribution and break - up cross section ( into the @xmath1n+p channel ) have been measured in fragmentation of @xmath0o on a be target at the energy 56 a mev @xcite .",
    "this opens a possibility for more precise calculations of the proton removal from @xmath2ne and evaluations of the contribution of the proton removal from the @xmath0o core to this process .    in this paper , we present a detailed analysis of the @xmath0o break - up in light targets .",
    "we perform the calculations in the eikonal approximation of the glauber model @xcite .",
    "this approach is well developed and convenient for calculations of break - up cross sections , interaction cross sections , and momentum distributions of fragments in break - up of a nucleus at intermediate and high energies ( from 30 to 1000 a mev ) .",
    "the formalism for the calculations is described in section [ secii ] .",
    "the main ingredients of the glauber model are the wave function of the relative motion of the fragments and the profile functions defining the fragment - target interaction .",
    "they are fixed using experimental data on the nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus cross sections , proton separation energies , the level scheme of the core nucleus , etc .",
    "in particular , the profile functions are fitted using the nucleus - nucleus and nucleon - nucleus interaction cross sections .",
    "the wave function is obtained in the core+proton ( @xmath1n+@xmath4 ) model of @xmath0o , where the @xmath1n core fragment can be in the ground and excited states ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the @xmath4-wave proton removal from @xmath0o ( @xmath5 ) leads to few @xmath1n bound states .",
    "we consider four of them ( for details see @xcite ) : @xmath6 mev ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 mev ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 mev ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 mev ( @xmath16 , @xmath14 ) . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the excitation energy and ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) are the spin and isospin of the @xmath1n state . for each state ,",
    "the depth of the ( @xmath1n+@xmath4 ) interaction potential ( see , below ) is fitted to reproduce the proton separation energy .",
    "the cross sections of the proton removal from the @xmath0o ground state are determined by the spectroscopic factors @xcite of the @xmath4-wave proton states .",
    "in section [ seciii ] we fit the profile functions in calculations of the corresponding nucleus - nucleus and proton - nucleus interaction cross sections , and compare results to the available experimental data .",
    "in section [ seciv ] we present the calculated cross sections and longitudinal momentum distributions of the @xmath1n fragments produced in various states in the process of the one - proton removal from @xmath0o on a @xmath20be target .",
    "these results are compared to the experimental data on the @xmath1n longitudinal momentum distribution and the break - up cross section measured at the energy 56 a mev @xcite .",
    "in the core - nucleon model of the projectile nucleus , the initial state is described by the wave function ( wf ) @xmath21 of the core - nucleon relative motion with a total angular momentum @xmath22 and its projection @xmath23 .",
    "the wf depends on the relative coordinate @xmath24 between nucleon and core .",
    "after interaction with a target , the wf of the projectile will be corrected by factors , connected with nucleon - target and core - target interactions .",
    "thus , the wf in the projectile rest frame is modified as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the coordinate of the center of mass of the projectile , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the transverse two dimensional impact parameters of the nucleon and the core with respect to the target nucleus , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are components , perpendicular to the beam direction taken as @xmath35 axis , and @xmath36 is the mass number of the core .",
    "the profile functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are generated by nucleon and core interactions with the target nucleus .",
    "the fragmentation includes nucleon stripping and diffraction processes .",
    "the corresponding cross sections are given by the equations @xcite",
    "@xmath39    the proton removal cross section is found as the sum @xmath40 ( [ crsec ] ) .",

    "we denote the part of the wf related to the relative motion as @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the spherical function .",
    "the radial part of the core - proton wf , @xmath48 , is obtained as a solution of the schrdinger equation for the woods - saxon potential ( the coulomb @xmath49 potential is also included ) . for each state of @xmath1n",
    ", the parameter @xmath50 of the woods - saxon potential is fitted to reproduce the proton separation energy with the fixed parameters @xmath51 fm and @xmath52=3.00 fm .",
    "the depth parameters and the proton separation energies are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "in the calculations of the cross sections and lm distributions of the fragments we consider the @xmath4 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) proton removal . the @xmath4-wave proton removal from @xmath0o",
    "leads to the residual @xmath1n core in the bound states @xmath6 mev ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 mev ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) @xmath12 mev ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 mev ( @xmath16 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "note , that the spectroscopic factors are not measured yet for @xmath0o . as was shown in the dwba analysis @xcite , the contribution of the protons with @xmath55 dominates in the proton transfer reaction leading to the ground state of @xmath0o .",
    "the spectroscopic factors of the states can be taken as those predicted by cohen and kurath @xcite .",
    "these values are close to the measured values in the neutron pickup reactions with the mirror @xmath0n nucleus , the @xmath0n@xmath56n reaction with 40 mev protons @xcite , and the @xmath0n@xmath57n reaction with 90 mev deuterons @xcite ( see the discussion in @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the value of the proton removal cross section is 92.0 mb . with larger target density parameter @xmath72 fm",
    "we get a larger values of the cross sections . in this case",
    ", the total proton removal cross section obtained with the spectroscopic factors @xcite is @xmath73 mb . so one can see that the total one proton removal cross section is not very sensitive to small variations of spectroscopic factors or target density parameter . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "the calculated lm distributions are compared to the experimental one @xcite .",
    "note , that the theoretical curves are shifted by 10 mev / c to the left to be compared to the experimental data .",
    "the solid line in the figure shows the total lm distribution obtained with all @xmath1n states shown in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "the dashed line represents the lm distribution from proton removal leading to @xmath1n in the ground state .",
    "as it corresponds to the smaller proton separation energy ( table [ tab2 ] ) , the lm distribution is narrower , than that for other @xmath1n states .",
    "thus , the fwhm value of the total lm distribution is larger than that for the @xmath1n ground state by 13 mev / c .",
    "the consideration of the @xmath1n production in the excited states does not change significantly the lm distribution because each @xmath1n state ( including the ground state ) is characterized by relatively high proton separation energy , and , hence , has nearly the same ( table [ tab3 ] ) lm distributions .",
    "thus , the value of fwhm is weakly sensitive to the weights of the @xmath1n states and the @xmath1n excitation .",
    "however , these contributions are essential in the calculations of the proton removal cross section .",
    "in this paper , we present calculations of the one - proton removal cross sections from @xmath0o on a be target at the energy 56 a mev .",
    "the proton removal cross sections , the @xmath0o interaction cross section , and the longitudinal momentum distribution of the @xmath1n fragments are obtained in the eikonal approximation of the glauber model with the nn interaction potential . in the calculations ,",
    "the production of the @xmath1n core fragment in the ground and excited states is regarded .",
    "the calculated fwhm=191 mev / c of the total lm distribution is very close to the experimentally measured value of @xmath71 mev / c @xcite .    the calculated value , 95.9 mb , of the total one - proton removal cross section is also very close to the experimental value @xmath74 mb @xcite .",
    "the break - up cross section is about 11% of the @xmath0o interaction cross section .",
    "returning to the @xmath2ne problem , we see that the contribution of the proton removal from the @xmath0o core might be essential . in particular , at the energy 66 a mev ( see experimental data @xcite ) ,",
    "we get the cross section of the proton removal from the core fragment 94.4 mb . due to the weakly - bound protons blocking the @xmath0o core in @xmath2ne , this cross section",
    "is reduced , contributing about 51 mb to the total one - proton removal cross section .",
    "the contribution of the valence proton removal in @xmath2ne with the spectacular @xmath0o core is about 110 mb @xcite .",
    "thus , the calculated total proton removal cross section will be 161 mb .",
    "this value satisfies the experimental one , @xmath75 mb @xcite .",
    "note , that the contribution of the proton removal from the @xmath0o core affects also the width of the total @xmath0o lm distribution .    as a result ,",
    "in the reactions with @xmath2ne , the proton removal cross section measured at the energy 66 a mev on a be target @xcite is relatively large compared to the cluster model ( @xmath0o@xmath3 ) predictions @xcite and the measured @xmath0o lm distribution is wider than calculated one ."
