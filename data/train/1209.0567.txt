    "the competition between the elasticity  the tendency to minimize their distortions  and the disorder  the inhomogeneities of the underlying medium  , blurred by thermal fluctuations at finite temperature , accounts for the resulting metastability and the consequent glassy properties observed in such systems .",
    "moreover the value of the roughness exponent @xmath17 , which characterizes the scaling properties of a self - affine manifold , is fully determined for a given des once the dimensionality , the type of elasticity and of disorder are chosen , thus promoting the value of @xmath17 to a reliable signature of the disorder universality class to which a given system might belong .",
    "the specific case of a 1d interface with a short - range elasticity and a random - bond ( rb ) quenched gaussian disorder can actually be mapped on other statistical - physics models in the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class @xcite , including in particular the so - called ` 1 + 1 directed polymer ' ( dp ) which has stimulated an increased activity lately , among both statistical physicists @xcite and mathematicians @xcite .",
    "a large variety of results emphasizes the deep connection which exists between the descriptions of a wide range of systems up to random matrices @xcite , such as the burgers equation in hydrodynamics  @xcite , roughening phenomena and stochastic growth  @xcite , last - passage percolation  @xcite , dynamics of cold atoms  @xcite , and vicious walkers  @xcite .",
    "a shared feature between those related models is the well - known kpz exponent @xmath18 , which characterizes the exact scaling at _ asymptotically _ large lengthscales or ` times ' , generated by the nonlinear kpz evolution equation and assuming an _ uncorrelated _ disorder @xcite .",
    "although of interest regarding the whole kpz class problems , there are two additional issues which turn out to be relevant especially for the study of experimental interfaces : on one hand , the characterization of the scaling properties _ at finite lengthscales _ , with possibly different regimes and crossover lengthscales regarding both the roughness exponent and the amplitude of the geometrical fluctuations ; on the other hand , the consequences of the interplay _ at finite temperature _ between thermal fluctuations and disorder . however , in order to have then a complete realistic description , an additional physical ingredient must be included in the des model : an experimental realization of interface always exhibits a finite microscopic width @xmath0 , which translates equivalently for a point - like interface into _ a finite disorder correlation length_. above a characteristic temperature @xmath19 , thermal fluctuations simply erase the existence of such a microscopic width , whereas at sufficiently low temperature it becomes relevant even for the macroscopic properties of the interface .",
    "those two temperature regimes can be hinted by simple scaling arguments @xcite , which are reflected in the two opposite functional - renormalization - group ( frg ) regimes of high - temperature @xcite versus zero - temperature fixed - point @xcite .",

    "unfortunately the gvm computation does not allow to grasp directly the correct asymptotic fluctuations of the 1d interface , as it predicts @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 , thus jeopardizing its predictions for the scaling in temperature of the roughness  @xcite . in order to circumvent this known gvm artefact ,",

    "it is known that @xmath25 @xcite , whereas at low temperatures we expect by scaling arguments  @xcite a saturation to @xmath26 that cures what would otherwise have been an unphysical divergence in the zero - temperature limit .",

    "<S> experimental realizations of a 1d interface always exhibit a finite microscopic width @xmath0 ; its influence is erased by thermal fluctuations at sufficiently high temperatures , but turns out to be a crucial ingredient for the description of the interface fluctuations below a characteristic temperature @xmath1 . exploiting the exact mapping between the static 1d interface and a 1 + 1 directed polymer ( dp ) growing in a continuous space , we study analytically both the free - energy and geometrical fluctuations of a dp , at finite temperature @xmath2 , with a short - range elasticity and submitted to a quenched random - bond gaussian disorder of _ finite _ correlation length @xmath3 .    we derive the exact ` time'-evolution equations of the disorder free - energy @xmath4   which encodes the microscopic disorder integrated by the dp up to a growing ` time '  @xmath5 and an endpoint position  @xmath6   its derivative  @xmath7 , and their respective two - point correlators @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the exact solution of its linearized evolution  @xmath10 , and we combine its qualitative behavior and the asymptotic properties known for an uncorrelated disorder ( @xmath11 ) , to justify the construction of a ` toymodel ' leading to a simple description of the dp properties . </S>",
    "<S> this model is characterized by gaussian brownian - like free - energy fluctuations , correlated at small  @xmath12 , and of amplitude  @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we present an extended scaling analysis of the roughness , supported by saddle - point arguments on its path - integral representation , which predicts @xmath14 at high - temperatures and @xmath15 at low - temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the connection between the temperature - induced crossover of  @xmath13 and the full replica - symmetry breaking ( full - rsb ) in previous gaussian variational method ( gvm ) computations . in order to refine our toymodel with respect to finite-`time ' geometrical fluctuations , we propose an effective ` time'-dependent amplitude  @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss the consequences of the low - temperature regime for two experimental realizations of kpz interfaces , namely the static and quasistatic behavior of magnetic domain walls and the high - velocity steady - state dynamics of interfaces in liquid crystals . </S>"
