    "carbon atoms bonded in a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice , named as _ graphene _ @xcite , recently engaged both theoretical and experimental attention due to a variety of unconventional properties .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry in graphene lattice structure leaves the brillouin zone with special points at its corners , allowing one to linearize the spectrum around those points , which leads to a conical dispersion . at filling one - half , when the chemical potential coincides with the apex of the cone , excitations can be described in terms of massless , chiral dirac fermions , where the fermi velocity @xmath6 plays the role of the velocity of light @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "many peculiarities in graphene s electronic properties arise from the dirac nature of the quasi- particles .",
    "one of the examples is the _ anomalous quantum hall effect_. placed in a magnetic field graphene exhibits integer quantum hall effect , where the hall states reside at filling factors @xmath8 with @xmath9 at low magnetic fields ( @xmath10 t ) @xcite .",
    "this phenomena can be understood from the relativistic nature of the non - interacting quasi - particles . upon exposing the system to stronger magnetic fields ( @xmath11 t ) , additional hall states appear at filling factors @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , the plateaus in the hall conductivity at other odd integer fillings ( for example , @xmath13 or @xmath14 etc . ) are absent even at the highest laboratory magnetic field ( @xmath15 t ) @xcite .",
    "these observations confirm that the four fold degeneracy of the zeroth landau level ( ll ) is completely lifted .",
    "furthermore , the sub - linear variation of the activation gap with magnetic field of the @xmath16 hall state points its origin toward electron - electron interactions .",
    "whereas the linear dependence of the activation gap with total magnetic field for @xmath17 hall states suggests that , possibly a finite zeeman coupling removes only the spin degeneracy from the higher lls . within the framework of the extended hubbard model with onsite and nearest - neighbor repulsion , one can show that the valley degeneracy only from the zeroth ll can be lifted , due to a spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry . in presence of a magnetic field",
    "such metal - insulator transition can take place even at sufficiently weak interaction .",
    "however , the higher lls gain a finite shift in energy only .",
    "therefore , one can explain the absence of hall states at odd integer fillings ( e.g. , @xmath18 ) from the protected valley degeneracy of the higher lls @xcite .",
    "+ in addition to the two - dimensional crystal structure , ripples are also present on the graphene sheet and introduce a fictitious gauge potential in the long wavelength limit @xcite .",
    "such corrugation of the graphene sheet is partially due to the strain induced by the @xmath19 substrate @xcite . in a normal graphene flake",
    "these defects are randomly distributed and therefore give a net zero flux of the fictitious field . perhaps , bulging or stretching of the graphene sheet",
    "can give rise to a finite pseudo flux @xcite .",
    "recently , its been argued that specific distortions of a flake can give rise to a uniform pseudo - magnetic field up to @xmath20 t @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a pseudo - magnetic field of strength @xmath21 t , is produced by depositing a graphene layer on platinum substrate , followed by cooling of the system @xcite . in contrary to the real magnetic field , the pseudo vector potential couples with opposite sign at two dirac points and hence preserves the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "therefore , in the presence of uniform real and pseudo field , one expects the lls to loose the valley degeneracy .",
    "this may also allow the formation of plateaus in hall conductivity at odd integer values of @xmath0 which were previously absent .",

    "one can study the response of magnetic field by defining @xmath54 , with magnetic field @xmath55 set to be perpendicular to the graphene plane . + in addition to the dirac quasi - particles , a crucial ingredient of the system is ripples .",
    "the effect of the ripples can be captured in terms of fictitious gauge fields in the long wavelength limit . in graphene flakes ,",
    "ripples are randomly distributed and therefore give a net zero flux of pseudo - magnetic field . whereas , a bulging of the graphene sheet may introduce a finite flux of the pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian in presence of both the real and pseudo - magnetic fields reads as @xmath56=\\tau_0 \\otimes i \\gamma_0\\gamma_i ( p_i - a_i - a_i^{35}\\gamma_{35}),\\ ] ] where , @xmath57 is the member of a general non - abelian @xmath58 gauge field , @xmath59 a smooth enough deformation in the graphene sheet , do not mix two inequivalent valleys at @xmath60 and @xmath61 . assuming that the bump in the graphene flake varies slowly on the lattice scale we kept only one component of a general @xmath58 gauge potential @xcite .",

    "a recent experiment confirmed such quantization in the presence of a pseudo - magnetic field of strength @xmath21",
    "however , the presence of finite real and pseudo - magnetic field removes the valley degeneracy from each ll .",

    "it is worth noticing that the lls associated with different dirac points do not enjoy the luxury of equal degeneracy .",

    "for example , if @xmath135 , af ordering lowers the the energy of the ground state .",
    "a cdw order can develop within the zeroth ll if on the other hand , the nearest - neighbor component of the finite range coulomb repulsion is the dominant one .",
    "however , due to imbalance in the number of states living on two sublattices in the zeroth ll , only the _",

    "the electron - electron interactions remove either the valley degeneracy or the sublattice degeneracy from the zeroth ll .",
    "these two are equivalent however only within the zeroth ll .",
    "alternatively , a large enough zeeman coupling will orient the magnetization at all the sites in the direction of the magnetic field and hence lower the energy of the filled dirac - fermi sea .",
    "such a ground state with finite magnetization can also be stabilized by increasing the component of the magnetic field parallel to the graphene plane .",

    "the exact nature of the correlated ground state in presence of a pseudo - magnetic field is yet to be determined and we leave this issue for future investigation .",
    "however , in the absence of any gauge potentials ( @xmath216 ) fluctuations preempt the appearance of qah and stabilizes the _ spin hall insulator _ ( qsh ) ground state .",
    "the correlated ground state in the qsh phase , breaks the trs for each spin component and the order parameter reads as @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "+ here we focused only on the finite - ranged components of the coulomb interaction . on the other hand",
    ", its long range @xmath218 tail is unscreened due to the vanishing density of states at the charge neutral point .",
    "if one turns off the pseudo - magnetic field the long range coulomb interaction will lead to a similar splitting of the lls .",
    "however , it introduces an energy scale @xmath219 , which is on the same order of the ll energy with commonly assumed dielectric constant @xmath220 for @xmath19 substrate .",
    "this immediately contradicts the experimentally observed gap of @xmath221 k at @xmath5 , an order of magnitude smaller than the ll energy @xcite .",
    "this issue can be resolved by assuming an order of magnitude larger value of the dielectric constant , which attributes the accumulation of water layer between the graphene flake and @xmath19 substrate @xcite . in recent work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that even though the long range coulomb interaction liberates all the lls from the valley degeneracy , the critical strength of the disorder above which the @xmath222 plateau is destroyed is much smaller than that for @xmath5 .",
    "this scenario , may explain the absence of odd integer hall plateaus in graphene @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the presence of a finite flux of pseudo field leads to an activation gap @xmath223 k for @xmath224 hall states ( table i ) .",
    "consequently , the hall states at those fillings should be much more robust against disorder .",
    "thus , one may expect to see the quantization of hall conductivity at odd integer factors of @xmath0 in a cleaner system . assuming a sufficiently large dielectric constant",
    ", one can restrict oneself to the short - ranged components of the coulomb interaction .",
    "effect of weak long - ranged coulomb interaction on the interaction mediated gap is discussed in ref .",
    "author is grateful to igor herbut and malcolm kennett for discussions and critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "author is also grateful to somshubra sharangi for useful suggestion about the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by nserc of canada .",
    "here we determine the quantization of the hall conductivity that we mentioned at the end of the sec .",
    "ii and sec .",
    "one notices that upon introducing a finite pseudo - magnetic flux , all the lls do not enjoy equal degeneracies .",
    "lls localized in the neighborhood of the dirac point at @xmath60 , have a degeneracy @xmath225 per unit area , whereas those living in the vicinity of the other dirac point , at @xmath61 , carry @xmath134 states per unit area . using the steda formula , one can write the expession of the hall conductivity as @xmath226 after setting @xmath227 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath153 is the electronic density in the bulk and the derivative with respect to @xmath96 is taken at fixed chemical potential ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "the chemical potential is measured from the charge neutral point . moreover , all the lls have additional two fold spin degeneracy . upon changing the magnetic field @xmath96 , number of states below the chemical potential",
    "is changed to @xmath229 @xmath230 and @xmath231 counts the number of lls below the chemical potential ( @xmath228 ) , but above the charge neutral point , with degeneracies @xmath232 per unit area for each spin species , respectively .",
    "therefore the hall conductivity is @xmath233 hence , quantization of the hall conductivity only takes the number of filled lls below the chemical potential into account .",
    "that leads to the the announced result of the hall conductivity in presence of real and pseudo - magnetic fields .",
    "however , one should notice that due to the different degeneracies of the lls , quantization of the hall conductivity at integer values of @xmath0 is not associated with integer fillings .",
    "the filling factors explicitly depend on the ratio @xmath234 .",
