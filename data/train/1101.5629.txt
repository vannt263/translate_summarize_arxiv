    "many features of biophysical systems and population dynamics are related to the randomness of the underlying processes , such as elementary molecular reactions , or birth and death , or infection and recovery .",
    "the randomness is important where the number of involved molecules or individuals , even though it is large , is not very large , as is often the case in gene expression , for example @xcite . in such mesoscopic domain fluctuations",
    "are small on average .",
    "then , if the system is in stationary conditions , for much of the time its molecular composition or the population size experience small variations about the values in dynamically stable states , i.e. , the stable states that the system would have with no fluctuations .",
    "examples are countless . besides single - cell protein levels @xcite",
    ", they range from microbial populations @xcite and motor proteins with different states strongly bound to the tracks @xcite to , at a larger scale , insect groups and worms that can switch between the directions of motion @xcite and , at a still larger scale , endemic states of infectious disease , where a part of the population is infected while the other part is not @xcite , or stable states in the predator - prey models @xcite .",
    "even where fluctuations are small on average , occasionally there occur large fluctuations that lead to dramatic changes in the system .",
    "an example is switching between dynamically stable states .",
    "it plays an important role in biophysical systems including the ones mentioned above .",
    "another example is extinction of a group of molecules or a population .",
    "a type of extinction that has attracted much attention in the literature is spontaneous disease extinction in an isolated population , where as a result of a fluctuation the number of infected becomes equal to zero and the epidemics ceases @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will be interested in the control of the rates of rare events that result from large fluctuations , including interstate switching and extinction .",
    "we will develop a general approach to control by deterministically imposed elementary transitions , in which the numbers of molecules or individuals change .",
    "the change is small and does not cause switching or extinction on its own .",
    "we show that , nevertheless , even weak deterministic control can strongly increase the rates of rare events .",
    "the approach will then be applied to control of disease extinction . here",
    "control is often performed by vaccination .",
    "sometimes there is not enough vaccine to eradicate the disease .",
    "we show how to optimize the control given a restriction on the amount of vaccine .",
    "the results refer also to a more general situation of a limited time - average speed at which the transitions are imposed .",
    "the problem of optimal control of large rare fluctuations has been discussed in qualitatively different terms for two major models of fluctuating systems , continuous and discrete .",
    "fluctuations in continuous systems are often thought of as resulting from an external noise , whereas control of such systems is performed by an applied regular field .",
    "this field can be optimized , for a given constraint , so that it will most efficiently change the rate of noise - induced rare events @xcite .",
    "populations or reacting species , on the other hand , are intrinsically discrete , with integer numbers of reacting molecules or individuals .",
    "the dynamics is often described as resulting from elementary transitions in which these numbers change .",
    "the transitions happen at random and are characterized by rates .",
    "these rates can be controlled , but the transitions still remain random .",
    "we call this elementary transition rates ( etr ) control",
    ". optimal control of this type was discussed in ref .  .",
    "because of the randomness of the elementary transitions , the constraint on the control field is in some sense probabilistic , for example , it can be imposed on the average amount of vaccine used in a given time period .",
    "we will consider here a different type of control , which is performed via deterministic processes ( dp ) where the numbers of reacting objects ( molecules or individuals ) change in a well - defined way at well - defined instants of time .",
    "we call it dp - control",
    ". we will show how to incorporate deterministic transitions into the analysis of large rare fluctuations .",
    "in particular , we will develop an eikonal approximation , which applies where the total numbers of reacting objects are large .",
    "it maps the problem of the probabilities of rare events in a reaction system onto hamiltonian dynamics of an auxiliary system .",
    "this formulation will be compared with the corresponding formulation for controlled reaction rates and for controlled continuous systems .",
    "the approach will then be applied to the problem of disease extinction with a limited amount of vaccine .",
    "we show that periodic vaccination implemented in a deterministic fashion can strongly enhance disease extinction .",
    "the enhancement can be resonant , for the appropriate vaccination period .",

    "spontaneous transitions happen at random and are characterized by rates @xmath4 . in addition , transitions may be imposed externally in a deterministic way .",

    "as mentioned earlier , a simple model of vaccination is where the vaccine is applied to susceptible individuals , and in an elementary transition a susceptible becomes vaccinated and thus immediately immune to the infection .",
    "a natural constraint on the speed of vaccination is that the total amount of vaccine per period @xmath134 is fixed , @xmath135 where @xmath110 is the vaccination period , @xmath136 .",

    "( [ eq : action_w_ls ] ) , minimization with respect to @xmath28 can be done in the same way as for probabilistic vaccination where the vaccination is a poisson process characterized by rate @xcite ; such vaccination is an example of the etr control .",
    "it follows from the form of the constraint ( [ eq : mean_vaccine_rate ] ) and the condition @xmath133 that the optimal vaccination speed as a function of time is independent of the logarithmic susceptibility @xmath123 . if the system is stationary in the absence of periodic vaccination , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : action_w_ls ] ) @xmath141 the minimum of @xmath116 is reached , and the inequality ( [ eq : inequal_se ] ) becomes an equality , for @xmath28 of the form of periodically repeated @xmath77-pulses , @xmath142 the instant @xmath143 determines where vaccination pulses are applied .",
    "it is arbitrary for a stationary system .",
    "in fact , the disease extinction events are adjusted to the vaccination pulses .",
    "this adjustment is described by the minimization over @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inequal_se ] ) ; the periodic function @xmath144 is minimal at @xmath143 .",
    "the optimal shape of @xmath28 is easy to understand : the vaccine is most efficient if it acts where @xmath145 is maximal , and also where @xmath146 to assure that @xmath147 .",
    "we note that strong periodic vaccination has been investigated in the framework of deterministic epidemic models , where all fluctuations are disregarded , and it was found that pulsed vaccination is advantageous compared to vaccination at a constant rate @xcite .    for periodically modulated systems , where @xmath4 are periodic functions of time , optimal @xmath28 still has the form of pulses , eq .",
    "( [ eq : action_minimized_explicit ] ) , but now spontaneous extinction events are synchronized without vaccination , and this is the vaccination that must adjust in order to increase the rate of disease extinction . equation ( [ eq : inequal_se ] ) for @xmath116 applies only if @xmath143 is chosen so that @xmath144 is minimal at @xmath143 ; a wrong choice of @xmath143 will be less efficient and can even slow down spontaneous disease extinction instead of speeding it up .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results with the probabilistic etr - type vaccination , where vaccination is applied at random with rate @xmath81 .",
    "the differences are in the form of the logarithmic susceptibility , cf .",
    "( [ eq : action_w_ls ] ) and ( [ eq : chi_probabilistic ] ) , and in the meaning of the parameter @xmath148 . in the deterministic scenario , @xmath149 gives the actual number of individuals vaccinated in time @xmath110 , which is fixed and is determined , for example , by the periodically supplied vaccine .",
    "in contrast , in the probabilistic scenario @xmath150 gives the average number of vaccinated individuals per time @xmath110 .",
    "the actual number is random . for large @xmath151 ,",
    "the distribution of the number of vaccinated is close to gaussian , with variance @xmath151 .",
    "expressions ( [ eq : define_q ] ) , ( [ eq : action_w_ls ] ) , and ( [ eq : action_minimized_explicit ] ) allow one to investigate the effect of optimal deterministic vaccination on the disease extinction rate , to study how this effect depends on the interrelation between the parameters of the system and vaccination , and to find the change of the disease extinction rate for specific models .",
    "the analysis is similar to that for probabilistic vaccination @xcite , and we will not reproduce it here . generally , the effect increases with the increasing period @xmath110 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : inequal_se ] ) .",
    "however , there may be important features that require special attention .    as an illustration",
    "we show the results for deterministic vaccination in one of the broadly used epidemic models , the susceptible - vaccinated - infected - recovered ( svir ) model @xcite . here , in the absence of vaccination , susceptible individuals , with population @xmath152 , are brought in at rate @xmath153 ( birth ) , each population decreases at rate @xmath154 , @xmath155 ( dying ) , the infection rate is @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the number of infected individuals , and infected can recover at rate @xmath158 .",
    "the vaccination that we discuss corresponds to the decrease of the number of susceptible individuals at speed @xmath159 .",

    "the solid line shows @xmath169 where there is no limit on vaccine accumulation .",
    "the dashed lines refer to the case of a limited amount of accumulated vaccine @xmath170 , where the actual mean speed of vaccination is @xmath171 .",
    "the scaled accumulation limit is @xmath172 .",

    "the populations oscillate also on the optimal disease extinction path @xcite . because of the oscillations , the fourier - transform of the logarithmic susceptibility @xmath173 displays a resonant peak shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances1 ]  ( a ) [ @xmath174 is obtained using the optimal trajectory @xmath127 found in ref .  ] .",
    "the peak of @xmath174 is centered at the frequency @xmath167 of decaying ( in the mean - field approximation ) oscillations near @xmath82 .    because of the spectral peak in @xmath174 , the vaccination - induced term in the extinction exponent @xmath175 depends on the vaccination period @xmath110 nonmonotonically .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances1 ]  ( b ) . where @xmath110 is close to a multiple of the oscillation period @xmath176",
    ", @xmath177 displays a peak . respectively , the disease extinction rate is exponentially enhanced in this case .    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances1 ]  ( b ) are also the results for @xmath116 in the case where the total amount of accumulated vaccine is limited , which means @xmath178 , where @xmath170 characterizes the accumulation limit .",
    "such constraint is typical for live vaccine , as it may be dangerous to store too much vaccine in this case . for a given period @xmath110 ,",
    "this is effectively a constraint on the average vaccination speed @xmath148 , as it makes no sense to increase it beyond @xmath179 .",
    "if we set @xmath180 for large @xmath110 , then it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : inequal_se ] ) that the effect of vaccination saturates with increasing period , @xmath181 however , the maximum of @xmath182 is reached not for @xmath183 , as seen from the dashed lines in fig .",

    "if the maximum of @xmath182 lies where the solid and dashed lines are separated , as for @xmath184 , the saturation limit has already been reached for the corresponding @xmath110 , and the actual vaccination speed @xmath171 is equal to @xmath179 . on the other hand , for @xmath185 the maximum of @xmath182 lies practically on the solid line , and thus it is reached for @xmath186 . in practice ,",
    "for a given maximum accumulation level @xmath170 and a given range of available average speeds @xmath148 and vaccination periods @xmath110 , one should adjust @xmath148 and @xmath110 so as to take advantage of the resonance while keeping @xmath187 equal to @xmath148 .",
    "we have developed a theory of control of large rare fluctuations in reaction and population systems by deterministically imposed transitions .",
    "these transitions occur at well - defined instants of time and cause well - defined changes in the numbers of individuals or reacting molecules .",
    "the control is comparatively weak , so that the mean - field dynamics of the system is perturbed very weakly .",
    "nevertheless the probabilities of rare events may be changed significantly .",
    "the theory applies to mesoscopic systems , where the characteristic number of molecules or individuals @xmath1 is large , but not exceedingly large , so that the rates of rare events , which depend on @xmath1 exponentially , are not exceedingly small .",
    "the analysis takes into account the discreteness of the numbers of individuals or molecules and the fact that the tail of the probability distribution is not smooth , the distribution changes by a factor where the number of individuals / molecules changes by one .",
    "our approach is based on the eikonal approximation .",
    "it allowed us to reduce the problem of the distribution tail to a hamilton - jacobi equation for the action of an auxiliary conservative dynamical system and express the hamiltonian in terms of the characteristic speed of the deterministic transitions .    of primary interest for this paper",
    "was control of such rare events as switching between coexisting stable states or population extinction .",
    "we found that even a comparatively weak control field can lead to an exponential increase of the rates of these events .",
    "the exponent is proportional to @xmath1 and linearly depends on the speed of the imposed transitions .",
    "it is determined by the motion of the system in the most probable fluctuation leading to the event in the absence of the control .",
    "the considered control should be contrasted with the etr control , where all elementary transitions happen at random , but their rates can be controlled .",
    "unexpectedly , we found that the etr control can be more efficient than the control by deterministically imposed transitions , provided the average transition speed and the composition change in a transition are the same .",
    "this is a consequence of the double optimization in the etr control , where the rate of the rare event is determined by both the optimal fluctuation leading to this event in the absence of control and the optimal realization of the control .",
    "we have considered the problem of optimal control of rare events where a number of deterministically imposed transitions per period is limited .",
    "the specific example is disease extinction by vaccination in the situation of a limited average speed of vaccine supply .",
    "the optimal shape of the vaccine pulses is a train of @xmath77-pulses .",
    "it is independent of the model of the system .",
    "the results are illustrated using the well - known susceptible - vaccinated - infected - recovered model , and the possibility of resonant exponential enhancement of the effect of vaccination is demonstrated for the deterministic vaccination .",
    "we note in conclusion that the theory of rare events in mesoscopic population and reaction systems developed in this paper fills the gap between the previously studied deterministic control of rare events in dynamical systems , which are continuous , and the etr control of reaction systems , which are inherently discrete .",
