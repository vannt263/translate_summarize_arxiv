    "mixed order parameter ( op ) systems often exhibit unanticipated material properties that can be of technological importance .",
    "a good example is that of the recently studied ferromagnetic martensite such as the heusler alloy .",
    "apart from the martensite transformation temperature , such alloys can in principle have different curie temperatures for the parent and the product phases that could be higher or lower than the martensite transformation temperature .",
    "it is believed that an interplay between the associated magnetic , elastic and magnetoelastic contributions leads to the unique properties of these alloys .",
    "for example , heusler alloys show reversible deformations that can be induced by application of magnetic field @xcite .",
    "ullakko et al @xcite were the first to report the field induced strain in heusler alloy and suggest that the magnetic field induced strain observed in martensite phases arises from the twin boundary motion rather than magnetostriction @xcite .",
    "similar effect has been reported in @xmath0 also @xcite .",
    "later much higher strains @xmath1 have been reported in huesler alloys @xcite .",
    "for this reason , ferromagnetic martensites are good candidates for actuator applications .    a large volume of experimental work has been devoted to study various physical properties characterizing the magnetoelastic transition @xcite including their dependence on alloying composition as the latter affects the transition temperatures @xcite . in view of their technological importance",
    ", several models have been proposed to explain the large reversible strain @xcite . apart from this ,",
    "there have been other studies to obtain the magnetic phase diagrams for different sequences of ordering of the martensite transformation temperature and the curie temperatures of the austenite and martensite phases using mean field models @xcite .    during martensitic transformation ,",
    "the higher symmetry phase undergoes a spontaneous deformation to a lower symmetry phase , for instance from a cubic parent phase to a tetragonal martensitic phase as in the case of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the short crystallographic axis is always the easy direction of magnetization @xcite and magnetic anisotropy can be quite large in some cases . for example , in ni - mn - ga martensites , the magnetic anisotropy in the martensitic phase is ( @xmath3 ) two orders greater than the parent austenite phase @xcite .",
    "thus , the spin ordering is expected to change across the twin variants of the martensite",
    ". however , there has been few attempts @xcite to study the changes in orientation of the magnetic order across the variants of the martensites , and also across the martensite - austenite interfaces .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is two fold .",
    "first , to propose a model that deals with the martensite transformation and the magnetic transition on a similar footing with the aim of capturing the influence of magnetic order on strain and vice versa .",
    "second , to study the orientation of the magnetic ordering in the martensite variants and in the parent phase for various possible orderings of the curie temperatures relative to the martensite start temperature .",
    "this exercise will be carried out within the context of a recently introduced model for square - to - rectangle martensite transformation .",
    "this model has been shown to capture several unusual properties associated with athermal martensites such as the power law statistics of the acoustic emission ( ae ) signals , the correlated nature of ae signals when the system is cycled in a small range of temperatures and the associated shape memory effect , and the precursors effect @xcite .",
    "the model is coupled to the magnetic order parameter through a four state clock model .",
    "the clock model is used as continuous spin system in two dimension do not support long range order . while the strain order parameter is governed by a bales and gooding type of equation @xcite , the development of magnetic order is carried out using monte - carlo method .",
    "we find that the magnetic order parameter which is generally oriented along the short axis of the rectangular variant changes as one crosses the martensitic twin interface or martensite - austenite interface .",
    "we also find that the magnetic order influences the strain and vice versa substantially .",
    "we also study the noise associated magnetic hysteresis @xcite that is similar to barkhausen noise .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the martensite start and finish temperatures respectively . defining @xmath6 and @xmath7 to be the curie temperatures of austenite and martensite phases , we have six different possible ways of ordering of the above temperatures .",
    "they are + a. @xmath8 + b. @xmath9 + c. @xmath10 + d. @xmath11 + e. @xmath12 + f. @xmath13 + the first four cases are situations where the austenite phase is the first to order ferromagnetically . for the cases @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the onset of the ferromagnetic temperature is determined by @xmath4 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "condition @xmath16 is more interesting because on lowering the temperature , the para to ferromagnetic transition takes place in the austenite phase followed by a martensitic transformation which becomes magnetic only on further lowering the temperature .",
    "the total free energy of a ferromagnetic martensite has contributions arising from the elastic energy @xmath17 , magnetic energy @xmath18 , and magnetoelastic coupling @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the order parameter for ferro - elastic transformation and @xmath21 the order parameter for the para to ferromagnetic transition .      here",
    "we adopt a recently introduced model for square - to - rectangle martensite in two dimensions . while the elastic free energy has contributions arising from all the three strain components , namely the bulk dilational , deviatoric and shear strains , we has used only the deviatoric strain as the principal order parameter @xcite . the effect of the other two strain components are included only in an indirect way ( see below ) .",
    "the strain order parameter @xmath22 is defined as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the displacement fields in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "the elastic free energy @xmath28 is the sum of the local free - energy functional @xmath29 and a nonlocal long - range term @xmath30 that describes the transformation induced strain - strain interaction .",

    "@xmath38 is the first - order transition temperature at which the free energy for the product and parent phases are equal , and @xmath39 is the temperature below which there are only two degenerate global minima @xmath40 .",

    "this is modeled by stress field @xcite represented by the third term in eq .",
    "this modifies the free - energy @xmath41 in such a way that the austenite phase is locally unstable leading to the nucleation of the product phase .    in principle ,",
    "long - range interaction between the transformed domains results from the elimination of the shear and bulk strains . in our model , this term has been introduced in a phenomenological way even though one can use the kernel obtained from st .",
    "principle @xcite .",
    "this has been taken to have the form @xmath42 we note here that unlike the long range term emerging from the compatibility constraint which is linear in @xmath20 , we have used @xmath43 term based on symmetry of the free energy under @xmath44 .",
    "however , we mention here that we have checked that using the kernel obtained by using compatibility condition gives results similar to the kernel used here . the kernel @xmath45 is best defined in the fourier representation as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fourier transform of @xmath48 .",

    "in addition , the free energy barrier is higher along the @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] directions .",
    "this is captured by the simple kernel given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are unit vectors in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "the step function @xmath59 has been introduced to impose a cutoff on the range of the long - range interactions .",

    "the real space picture of @xmath61 is similar to the long - range interaction of kartha et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "we have used rayleigh dissipation functional @xcite to account for the dissipation accompanying rapid interface motion described by @xmath62 this dissipation term has been successfully used to account for several features of acoustic energy dissipated during the martensitic transformation @xcite .",

    "we use this for obtaining the equations of motion for @xmath20 .",
    "as stated earlier , one of our main interest is to study the direction of magnetic order in the martensite variants and in the parent phase .",
    "however , it is well known that continuous spin ( @xmath68 asymmetry ) systems do not support long range order in 2-d .",
    "for this reason , we use a 4-state clock model .",
    "the free - energy has contributions from exchange interaction , zeeman energy , and magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy and is given by , @xmath69 where the first term is the exchange energy , the second term is the magnetic anisotropic energy and the third the zeeman term .",
    "the spin vector @xmath21 is allowed to assume four values _",
    "@xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the austenite phase , and four similar values with respect to the diagonal in the martensite phase ( see below ) .",
    "the sum for the first term is taken over the nearest neighbors .",
    "the coefficient @xmath74 is different for the austenite and martensite phase ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "@xmath76 is the anisotropy coefficient and @xmath77 the applied magnetic field .",
    "( @xmath78 is the angle between the magnetic field and the @xmath79 axis . ) in the martensite phase , we have used two different values for @xmath80 , one each corresponding to the short and long sides of the martensite variant ( in addition to the anisotropy term ) .",
    "the magnetic anisotropic energy sets the orientation of the magnetic order parameter along the easy axis .",
    "usually , one uses @xmath81 , where @xmath21 is the angle measured with respect to the @xmath79 axis . from our earlier studies @xcite , we know that the martensitic variants are along the diagonal .",
    "thus , in order to have magnetic order parameter oriented along these easy directions in the martensite phase , we have subtracted @xmath82 .",
    "this gives upto an additive term @xmath83 .",
    "lastly , there is magnetostriction energy given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the phenomenological magnetoelastic constant .",
    "the effect of the strain produced during the martensitic transformation on the magnetic transition is captured by this term . here again , considering the fact that @xmath20 takes on positive and negative values for the two twin variants and that these twins are oriented along the diagonal , the above term is minimum along the diagonal . the total magnetic contribution to the free energy is given by the sum of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 .",
    "the total free energy is minimized with respect to both the order parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 . here , we note that while strain op is continuous , the magnetic op is discrete .",

    "a random distribution of @xmath105 defects is used which for @xmath106 gives @xmath107 .",

    "the initial values of the spin @xmath114 at the location @xmath115 are taken to be randomly oriented among @xmath116 or @xmath117 directions in the austenite phase and @xmath118 or @xmath119 in the martensite phase .",
    "thus , the allowed spin flips are through @xmath120 . however , when crossing either the twin or the martensite - austenite boundaries , we allow spin flips of @xmath121 to ensure that the spin orientations across the boundaries change appropriately .",
    "the anisotropy coefficient is taken to be @xmath122 and the magnetostriction coefficient @xmath123 in our simulations ( unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "the exchange interactions @xmath74 which fixes the curie temperatures of the magnetic phases is chosen so as to obtain the required ordering of the curie temperatures . in the monte - carlo simulations , when computing the equilibrium magnetization at each temperature , the first @xmath124 mc steps were discarded for thermalising , and averages are carried out over the next @xmath125 mc steps .",
    "( we find that this duration is adequate for obtaining steady state values of the magnetization . ) in the martensite phase , we have assumed that @xmath80 is different along the short and long axis of the variant denoted by @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively .    before presenting our results , we note here that two types of simulations are possible due to separation of time scales associated with the two order parameters . as mentioned earlier",
    ", our model describes athermal martensite , and thus , the time evolution of the strain order parameter is considered fast compared to the magnetic order parameter ( even though there is no direct mapping of monte - carlo time with the real time ) .",
    "thus , the first possibility is to evolve the strain order parameter till a stationary morphology of the martensites is obtained and then a mc evolution of the magnetic order parameter is effected ( or vice versa depending on the ordering of the transition and transformation temperatures ) . in the second type of simulation , the strain op is allowed to develop for a short time ( long enough time to reach stationary values ) and mc evolution is carried out for about 3,00,000 steps .",
    "this sequence is repeated till stationary values of both the op s are achieved . for most purposes , we find that the first type of simulations is adequate .",
    "however , we shall also report the results on the second type of simulation which demonstrates the substantial mutual influence of the two order parameters .",
    "before proceeding further , we note that it is necessary to make a correspondence between the temperature scale used in the mc simulations with the temperature scale used in eq .",
    "[ epsilon ] . in our mc simulations ,",
    "the scale of temperature is in the range of unity as we choose @xmath128 in the neighborhood of unity ( in units of @xmath129 ) for the austenite phase .",

    "as the temperature is lowered below @xmath4 ( @xmath150 ) , some regions of the austenite phase undergoes structural transformation to the martensite phase which then orders ferromagnetically .",
    "this is reflected as an abrupt increase in the magnetization around @xmath151 evident from fig .",

    "in addition , we note that the contribution to the total magnetization from the austenite phase is higher as magnetization ( per unit area ) of this phase is oriented along the @xmath79 direction compared to the martensite phase which is oriented along @xmath155 . however , as we decrease the temperature , the decreasing volume fraction of the austenite compensates the oriented contribution from the austenite phase to the total magnetization .",
    "consequently , a further decrease in temperature leads to a marginal decrease in the magnetization around @xmath156 eventually saturating to a value around 0.7 .",

    ", it is pertinent to recall that in our earlier work we have shown that the dissipation accompanying the strain changes have all the characteristic features of acoustic emission @xcite .",

    "in summary , we have extended the recently introduced two dimensional square - to - rectangle martensite model to include the magnetic order parameter through a 4-state clock model to study ferromagnetic martensites .",
    "the model includes all the features of the structural transformation ( ie . , long - range strain interaction , inertia , and defect centers that act as nucleation sites ) and magnetic transition ( ie . , the exchange interaction , anisotropy , and magnetostriction ) .",
    "the model is used to explain the magnetization curves of the austenite - martensite system under various ordering of the curie temperatures and the martensite transformation temperature . by choosing appropriate exchange interactions in the two phases , we are able to obtain the characteristic magnetization plots .",
    "the model shows that the orientations of the magnetic order of the @xmath213 twins are along @xmath155 directions , whereas it is orientated along the @xmath214 axis in the austenite phase .",
    "further , the model also captures the abrupt change in the orientation of the magnetization across the two variants of the martensite as also the austenite - martensite phase boundary .",
    "the model shows that there is a subtle interplay between the growth of the strain and magnetic order parameters that leads to jumps in magnetization at @xmath152 in cases when the @xmath152 of the austenite phase is lower than @xmath149 ( or @xmath4 ) , a feature not predicted by the mean field models .",
    "the model also shows that the strain order parameter is influenced by the magnetic order and vice versa in a significant way . as this mutual influence",
    "is triggered by the magneto - striction coupling , the model may have relevance to terfenol - d .",
    "in particular , the magnetic order appears to change the initial strain morpholgy of martensite domains in a substantial way .",
    "studies on hysteresis coupled with the earlier identification of dissipation with acoustic emission shows that the dissipation is maximum while the applied field passes through zero value .",
    "this feature is similar to the barkhausen noise .",
    "the barkhausen noise has been explained as arising from pinning and depinning of the magnetic domains . in our case , as shown earlier @xcite , it results for the jerky motion of the interface .",
    "the driving force for this change is , however , the interaction between the strain and the magnetic order parameter .",
    "it is also clear that the approach taken here can be extended to systems where ferroelectric order parameter has strong coupling to strain .",
