    "quantum phases in frustrated systems are being intensively investigated these days ; in particular in the context of quantum spin glass and quantum annni models @xcite . here",
    "we study a fully - frustrated quantum antiferromagnetic model .",
    "specifically , the long - range antiferromagnetic ising model put under transverse field . the finite temperature properties of sub - lattice decomposed version of this model was already considered earlier @xcite .",
    "the quantum phase transition and entanglement properties of the full long - range model at zero temperature was studied by vidal et al @xcite . here we present some results obtained by applying quantum monte carlo technique @xcite to the same full long - range model at finite temperature .",
    "we observe indications of a quantum phase transition in the model , where the antiferromagnetically ordered phase gets destabilised by both infinitesimal thermal ( classical ) as well quantum fluctuations ( due to tunneling or transverse field ) and the system becomes disordered or goes over to the para phase .",
    "the ordered phase of the long range ising antiferromagnet ( lriaf ) seems to be extremely volatile and loses the order ( freezing of spin orientations ) at any finite fluctuation level ; classical or quantum",
    ". however the lriaf model has the required frustration of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model , which could support the spin glass order , but for any disorder . to check",
    "if this ` liquid'-like antiferromagnetic phase of lriaf can get ` crystallized ' into spin - glass phase if a little disorder is added , we study next this lriaf hamiltonian with a tunable coupling with the sk spin glass hamiltonian and study this entire system s phase transitions induced by both thermal and tunneling field . indeed , the stable sk spin glass phase is observed for thermal or quantum fluctuations below finite threshold values .",
    "we employ the analytic ( mean field ) solution of the transverse ising model with long - range interactions can be in presence of the special kind of quenched disorder appropriate for the sk spin glasses . with this , we study the phase diagram for the sk model with lriaf bias in a transverse field . we again find that the antiferromagnetic order is immediately broken when one adds an infinitesimal transverse field or thermal fluctuation to the system . however , an infinitesimal sk - type disorder is enough to make the system ` crystallized ' into a glass phase .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the pure quantum lriaf model and then discuss the ( finite temperature ) quantum monte carlo results . in section 3 , we consider the sk model with antiferromagnetic bias in a transverse field , and discuss the ( analytic ) mean field phase diagram . in section 4 , we present some discussions on our results .",
    "the hamiltonian of the infinite - range quantum ising antiferromagnet ( without any spin glass disorder ) is @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the long - range antiferromagnetic @xmath2 exchange constant ; for convenience , we fix the value @xmath3 in this section . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the @xmath6 and @xmath7 component of the @xmath8 pauli spins    @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote respectively the longitudinal and transverse fields .",
    "we have denoted the co - operative term of @xmath12 ( including the external longitudinal field term ) by @xmath13 and the transverse field part as @xmath14 .",
    "as such the model has a fully frustrated ( infinite - range or infinite dimensional ) co - operative term . at zero temperature and at zero longitudinal and transverse fields , the @xmath13 would prefer the spins to orient in @xmath15 directions only with zero net magnetization in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "this antiferromagnetically ordered state is completely frustrated and highly degenerate .",
    "switching on the transverse field @xmath11 would immediately induce all the spins to orient in the @xmath6-direction ( losing the degeneracy ) , corresponding to a maximum of the kinetic energy term and this discontinuous transition to the para phase occurs at @xmath16 .",
    "however , at any finite temperature the entropy term coming from the extreme degeneracy of the antiferromagnetically ordered state and the close - by excited states does not seem to induce a stability of this phase .",
    "this hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian1 ] ) can be mapped to a @xmath17-dimensional classical hamiltonian @xcite using the suzuki - trotter formula .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the number of trotter replicas and @xmath21 denotes the @xmath21-th row in the trotter direction .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the nearest - neighbor interaction strength along the trotter direction .",
    "we have studied the system for @xmath23 . because of the diverging growth of interaction @xmath22 for very low values of @xmath11 and also for high values of @xmath20 , and the consequent non - ergodicity ( the system relaxes to different states for identical thermal and quantum parameters , due to frustrations , starting from different initial configurations ) , we have kept the value of @xmath20 at a fixed value of @xmath24 .",
    "this choice of @xmath20 value helped satisfying the ergodicity of the system up to very low values of the transverse field at the different temperatures considered @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "starting from a random initial configurations ( including all up or 50 - 50 up - down configurations ) we follow the time variations of different quantities until they relax and study the various quantities after they relax .",
    "we studied results for three different temperatures @xmath27 and @xmath28 and all the results are for @xmath23 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we estimated the following quantities after relaxation :    \\(i ) _ correlation along trotter direction ( @xmath31 ) _ : we studied the variation of the order parameter @xmath32 which is the first neighbor correlation along trotter direction . here , @xmath33 indicate the average over initial spin configurations .",
    "this quantity @xmath31 shows a smooth vanishing behavior .",
    "we consider this correlation @xmath34 as the order parameter for the transition at @xmath35 .",
    "a larger transverse field is needed for the vanishing of the order parameter for larger temperature .",
    "the observed values ( see figure [ fig : insetq ] ) of @xmath35 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "as shown in the inset , an unique data collapse occurs when @xmath31 is plotted against @xmath40 and one seems to get the complete disorder immediately as the scaling dos not involve any finite value @xmath41 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations in the next section .",
    "\\(ii ) _ susceptibility ( @xmath42 ) _ : the longitudinal susceptibility @xmath43/{\\partial h}$ ] , where @xmath10 ( @xmath44 ) is the applied longitudinal field , has also been measured .",
    "we went up to @xmath45 and estimated the @xmath42 values .",
    "as we increase the value of the transverse field @xmath11 from a suitably chosen low value , @xmath42 initially starts with a value almost equal to unity and then gradually saturates at lower values ( corresponding to the classical system where @xmath46 in eq.(2 ) ) as @xmath11 is increased .",
    "also at @xmath16 , the classical values are indicated in figure [ fig : inset5 ] .",
    "this saturation value of @xmath42 decreases with temperature . again",
    "the field at which the susceptibility saturates are the same as for the vanishing of the order parameter for each temperature .",
    "\\(iii ) _ average energy ( e ) _",
    ": we have measured the value of the co - operative energy for each trotter index and then take its average @xmath47 i.e. @xmath48 of eq . ( 1 ) with @xmath3 .",
    "it initially begins with @xmath49 and after a sharp rise the average energy saturates , at large values of @xmath11 , to values corresponding to the classical equilibrium energy ( @xmath50 for @xmath46 in eq.(2 ) ) at those temperatures .",
    "again it takes larger values of @xmath11 at higher temperatures to achieve the classical equilibrium energy . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the corresponding classical values of @xmath47 are plotted in figure [ fig : inset4 ] .",
    "the variations of all these quantities indicate that the ` quantum order ' disappears and the quantities reduce to their classical values ( corresponding to @xmath46 in for large values of the transverse field @xmath11 .",
    "first , let us consider the case of pure lriaf model and rewrite our hamiltonian @xmath12 in eq.(1 ) for @xmath51 as @xmath52 if we now denote the total spin by @xmath53 i.e. @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 ) , then the hamiltonian @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath56 let us assume the average total spin @xmath57 to be oriented at an angle @xmath58 with the @xmath7-direction : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "hence the average total energy @xmath61 can be written as @xmath62 at the zero temperature and at @xmath16 , for @xmath63 , the energy @xmath64 is minimised when @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( complete antiferromagnetic order in @xmath7-direction ) .",
    "as soon as @xmath67 ( @xmath63 ) the minimisation of @xmath64 requires @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( the maximum possible value ) ; driving the system to paramagnetic phase .",
    "this discontinuous transition at @xmath70 was also seen in @xcite .",
    "as observed in our monte carlo study in the previous section , @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "this is consistent with this exact result @xmath73 at @xmath70 . for @xmath70 ( and @xmath63 ) , therefore , the transition from antiferromagnetic ( @xmath74 ) to para ( @xmath75 ) phase , driven by the transverse field @xmath11 , occurs at @xmath16 itself .",
    "one can also estimate the susceptibility @xmath42 at @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath77 and the minimisation of this energy gives @xmath78 giving the ( longitudinal ) susceptibility @xmath79 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed behaviour of @xmath42 shown in figure [ fig : inset5 ] where the extrapolated value of @xmath42 at @xmath16 increases with decreasing @xmath80 and approaches @xmath81 as @xmath72 .    at finite temperatures @xmath82 , for @xmath63",
    ", we have to consider also the entropy term and minimise the free energy @xmath83 rather than @xmath64 where @xmath84 denotes the entropy of the state .",
    "this entropy term will also take part in fixing the value of @xmath58 and @xmath85 at which the free energy @xmath86 is minimised .",
    "as soon as the temperature @xmath80 becomes non - zero , the extensive entropy of the system for antiferromagnetically ordered state with @xmath87 ( around and close - by excited states with @xmath65 ) helps stabilisation near @xmath65 and @xmath66 rather than near the para phase with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where the entropy drops to zero .",
    "while the transverse field tends to align the spins along @xmath6 direction ( inducing @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , the entropy factor prohibits that and the system adjusts @xmath58 and @xmath85 values accordingly and they do not take the disordered or para state values ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) for any non - zero value of @xmath11 ( like at @xmath70 ) .",
    "for very large values of @xmath11 , of course , the free energy @xmath86 is practically dominated by the transverse field term in @xmath12 and again @xmath68 and @xmath69 , beyond @xmath88 for @xmath89 . however , this continuous transition - like behaviour may be argued @xcite to correspond to a crossover type property of the model at finite temperatures ( suggesting that the observed finite values of @xmath90 are only effective numerical values ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath63 one adds the entropy term @xmath91 to @xmath64 in eq.(7 ) to get @xmath86 and one can then get @xcite , after minimising the @xmath86 with respect to @xmath85 and @xmath58 , @xmath92 , which indicates an analytic variation of @xmath85 and no phase transition at any finite temperature for @xmath51 ( antiferromagnetic phase occurs only at @xmath93 as shown in figure [ fig : fg2 ] .",
    "in the last part of this paper , we discuss the phase diagram for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model with antiferromagnetic bias in a transverse field .",
    "we find that the antiferromagnetic order is immediately broken when one adds an infinitesimal transverse field or thermal fluctuation to the system , whereas an infinitesimal sk - type disorder is enough to get the system ` crystalized ' into the glass phase .",
    "the model we discuss here is given by the following hamiltonian @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a parameter whcih controlls the strength of the antiferromagnetic bias and @xmath96 is an amplitude of the disorder @xmath97 in each pair interaction .",
    "the @xmath11 controls the quantum - mechanical fluctuation .",
    "when we assume that the disorder @xmath97 obeys a gaussian with mean zero and variance unity , the new variable @xmath98 follows the following distribution .",
    "@xmath99/{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\tilde{j}}$ ] .",
    "therefore , we obtain the ` pure ' antiferromagnetic ising model with infinite range interactions when we consider the limit @xmath100 keeping @xmath101 . on ther other hand , for @xmath102 with @xmath103",
    "is identical to the classical sk model . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the condition for which the antiferromagnetic order survives .    for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , we immediately obtain the saddle point equations under the static and replica symmetric approximations as follows ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is a magnetization and @xmath107 is a spin glass order parameter .",
    "we defined @xmath108 .",
    "the bracket @xmath109 denotes an expectation over the density matrix : @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath1 is negative , ( [ eq : quantum_m ] ) has the only solution @xmath111 .",
    "the general phase boundaries ( see figure 4 ) between the ferro ( f ) , spin glass ( sg ) , antiferro ( af ) and para ( p ) phases can be obtained by solving the the above two equations in the limit @xmath112 for the f - sg boundary , @xmath113 for sg - p boundary and @xmath114 fot the f - p boundary . in these limits ,",
    "the p - sg boundary equations become ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath115      in the classical limit , the equations of state are simplified as @xmath116 , @xmath117 . for @xmath101 , we find that @xmath118 is only physical solution for all temperature regimes .",
    "this fact means that there are three possible phases , namely , the antiferromagnetic phase , the paramagnetic phase and the spin glass phase . in these three phases , the magnetization @xmath85 is zero . to determine the critical point @xmath119 at which the spin glass transition takes place",
    ", we expand the equation with respect to @xmath34 for @xmath120 and @xmath118 .",
    "then , we have @xmath121 and the critical point is independent of the antiferromagnetic bias @xmath95 .    , there exist spin glass phase below @xmath122 and the critical temperature is independent of the strength of the antiferromagnetic bias @xmath95 . for finite temperature @xmath123 , the anti - ferromagnetic order dissapears and",
    "the system changes to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "when we add an infinitesimal disorder @xmath124 , the antiferromagnetic order is broken down and the system suddenly gets ` crystalized ' into a spin glass ( sg ) phase.,width=377 ]    this result means that the antiferromagnetic order can apprear if and only if we set @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath127 at low temperature regime @xmath128 , the spin glass phase appears .",
    "we plot the phase diagram in figure [ fig : fg2 ] .",
    "we also conclude that the system described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath103 is immediately ` crysterlized ' when we add any infinitesimal disorder @xmath129 .    from the view point of the degeneracy of the spin configurations",
    ", we easily estimate the number of solution for the antiferromagnetic phase as @xmath130 , which is larger than the number of the sk model @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "however , for the infinite range antiferromagnetic model , the energy barrier between arbitrary configurations which gives the same lowest energy states is of order @xmath132 and there is no ergodicity breaking .",
    "we next consider the case of presence of transverse field @xmath133 . in this case",
    ", we also find that the saddle point equation ( [ eq : quantum_m ] ) has a solution @xmath118 and the phase boundary between the spin glass and paramagnetic phases is given by setting @xmath118 and @xmath120 and we get ( [ eq : boundary ] ) .",
    "obviously , the boundary at @xmath134 gives @xmath135 .",
    "on the other hand , when we consider the case of @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 .",
    "these fact means that there is no antiferromagnetic nor the spin glass phase when we consider the pure case @xmath51 because the critical point leads to @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the antiferromagnetic phase can exisit if and only if @xmath139 .    .",
    "as the @xmath96 decreases , the spin glass phase gradually shrinks to zero and eventually ends up at an antiferromagnetic phase at its vertex ( for @xmath140 ) as discussed in section 2 .",
    ", width=377 ]",
    "we considered here a long - range ising antiferromagnet at a finite temperature and put in a transverse field .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order is seen to get immediately broken as soon as the thermal or quantum fluctuations are added .",
    "however , when we add the sherrington - kirkpatrick hamiltonian as perturbation we find that an infinitesimal sk spin glass disorder is enough to induce a stable glass order in this lriaf antferromagnet .",
    "this glass order eventually gets destroyed as the thermal or quantum fluctuations increased beyond their threshold values and the transition to para phase occurs .",
    "as shown in the phase diagram in figure 5 , the antiferromagnetic phase of the lriaf ( ocurring only at @xmath141 ) , can get ` crystalised ' into spin - glas phase if a little sk - type disoder is added ( @xmath142 ) ; the only missing element in the lriaf ( which is fully frustrated , but lacks disorder ) to induce stable order ( freezing of random soin orientations ) in it . as mentioned already , the degeneracy factor @xmath143 of the ground state of the lriaf is much larger than that @xmath131 for the sk model .",
    "hence , ( because of the presence of full frustration ) the lriaf posses a surrogate incubation property of stable spin glass phase in it when induced by addition of a small disorder .",
    "this observation should enable eventually the study of classical and quantum spin glass phases by using some perturbation theory with respect to the disorder .",
