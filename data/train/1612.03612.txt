    "interferometry has proven to be an effective tool for high - sensitivity measurements in physics .",
    "for example , the recent groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves @xcite relied on michelson interferometers to measure ripples in the curvature of space - time predicted 100 years ago by the theory of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "this achievement indicates that state - of - the - art technology enables the realization of interferometers capable of detecting gravitational effects even on quantum particles .",
    "while there exists a well developed framework incorporating general relativistic gravity into quantum physics quantum field theory on curved space - time @xciteits most distinctive predictions , such as hawking radiation from black holes , are nowhere close to be testable in the near future .",
    "various experiments have been proposed to test its other predictions , e.g. general relativistic corrections to the newtonian gravitational phase shift for massive particles @xcite . yet",
    ", the size of the interferometric setups that are necessary to observe these corrections is still beyond the reach of the present - day technological capabilities . rapidly advancing quantum optics technology allows for quantum states of light to be transmitted over increasingly large distances , which sparked proposals for experiments probing the effects of the space - time curvature on photons @xcite . as a first important step towards this goal",
    ", we propose an experimental scheme for observing the gravitational phase shift on a single photon .",
    "we discuss the gravitational effects on the single - photon state inside a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) , which is placed vertically inside the earth s gravitational field .",
    "we show that the use of optical fibers together with a modification of the classic mach - zehnder scheme allows to obtain a detectable signal , even in the presence of noise .",
    "+ the first experiment testing the influence of a gravitational potential at a quantum level was performed by colella , overhauser and werner using neutrons in a matter - wave interferometer @xcite .",
    "subsequent measurements of the gravitational acceleration _",
    "g _ have also relied on atoms and molecules @xcite . however , because these experiments all used massive particles , they can be interpreted within the framework of newtonian gravity ; on the other hand , gravitational tests with massless particles , e.g. measurement of the shapiro delay @xcite , require a general relativistic explanation @xcite . in order to detect gr effects on single photons , a mzi with arms located at different heights above the earth can be used @xcite .",
    "the time of emission of the photon serves as a clock , keeping track of the evolved proper time along each path of the interferometer @xcite . by reading the state of the clock we gain information about the path taken by the photon inside the mzi , which should lead to a drop in visibility according to the quantum complementarity principle @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect the visibility to start decreasing once the relative gr proper time difference between the arms approaches the photon coherence time ( the precision of the clock ) .",
    "the observation of such a drop in visibility would constitute a genuine test of the interplay between gr and quantum mechanics .",
    "unfortunately , interferometers with arm lengths of a few thousand kilometers would be required for such an experiment .",
    "such large - scale interferometers are currently only feasible for space - based experiments @xcite .",
    "however , a smaller interferometer still allows for measuring gravitationally induced phase shifts as we discuss in this work .",
    "a successful demonstration of this phase shift would constitute e.g. a verification of the equivalence between the energy of a single photon and its effective gravitational mass @xcite .",
    "+ a conventional mzi , with arms of length _",
    "l _ separated in height by a distance _ h _ , placed vertically inside earth s gravitational field is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ordinarymzi ] .",
    "the relation between the enclosed area @xmath1 and gravitational phase difference is approximately given by @xcite    @xmath2    where _ n _ is the group effective index of the transmissive medium for light propagation , _",
    "g _ is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath3 is the central wavelength used to excite the interferometer and _ c _ is the speed of light in vacuum . the gravitational phase shift can be interpreted to be a result of the coupling of the average energy of a photon with effective mass @xmath4 to the newtonian gravitational potential @xcite . if the coherence time of the photon is much larger than the proper time difference experienced between different paths the fringe visibility is high and the detection probabilities at the two output detectors are given by     placed vertically inside earth s gravitational field .",
    "a beam splitter ( bs ) transforms a single photon into a coherent superposition between the two possible arms .",
    "the wave function evolves along two different paths and arrives at the merging beam splitter at the same time but slightly shifted in phase due to the presence of a gravitational potential . ]",
    "@xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes the time varying phase - noise contributions present in any real interferometric setup .",
    "the required interferometric area for a given wavelength depends on the phase difference as given by eq . .",
    "due to the small effective mass of the photons , the required area of the interferometric set - up is much larger than the area needed for matter - wave interferometry @xcite . for photons in the optical regime ( @xmath7 m ) ,",
    "an area of about @xmath8 m@xmath9 leads to a phase shift on the order of @xmath10 rad . in order to achieve such large - area interferometers ,",
    "optical fibers are ideally suited for compact arrangements even at the table - top scale .",
    "remarkably , commercially available fiber spools containing @xmath11 km of fiber do not exceed @xmath12 m@xmath13 of volume and 10 kg of weight which makes them suitable for implementations in the laboratory despite the long path lengths required .",
    "in a noise - free environment the measurement of the gravitational phase shift would be straightforward .",
    "the mzi could first be calibrated by orienting the setup horizontally such that the area ( _ a _ ) is parallel to the surface of the earth to equalize the optical path lengths of the arms ; then , by orienting the interferometer vertically ( fig .",
    "[ 3armmzi ] ) , we could determine the gravitational phase by simply observing the difference in count rates between the detectors . in reality , however , fiber interferometers can also be used as sensors for various physical and chemical variables due to their high sensitivity for external perturbations @xcite .",
    "this leads in our case to noise induced signal fading @xcite , which is a change in the amplitude of the detected signal as a function of time .",
    "it is therefore necessary to design an experiment capable of distinguishing the static gravitational signal from time - dependent noise .",
    "tanaka proposed a possible solution for an all - fiber mzi @xcite , where the arrangement can be rotated about an axis parallel to its arms .",
    "the phase difference between the two arms is angle - dependent and can be measured for all intermediate angles between the horizontal and vertical orientation of the interferometer .",
    "measurements are only taken when the angle between the surface of the earth and the area of the interferometer is fixed .",
    "due to the static nature of this rotation and the impossibility of calibrating the interferometer for different angles without losing the desired information , this scheme relies heavily on passive stabilization of the fibers . for the proposed area of @xmath14 m@xmath9 phase - noise larger than @xmath15 rad within the detection band",
    "must be suppressed .",
    "although such stability has been demonstrated in fiber interferometers @xcite , achieving this precision for such a large - scale interferometer is a challenge . in the scheme we present here , we modulate the gravitational potential difference even when the interferometer is at a fixed position during the measurements ( fig .",
    "[ 3armmzi ] ) .",
    "our scheme consists of a rotatable 3-arm mzi ( fig .",
    "[ 3armmzi ] ) .",
    "each of the three arms is made up of a fiber beam splitter(fbs ) , a fiber phase shifter ( fps ) and an optical fiber of length @xmath16 .",
    "the interferometer can be shielded from external noise , arising from temperature fluctuations and air currents , by placing it in a vacuum chamber . in order to reduce coupling to vibrations ,",
    "the entire set - up can be placed on an actively stabilized vibration isolation system .",
    "an optical switch ( os ) , consisting of an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , is used to connect the additional arm to the conventional mzi , directing the photons either along arm 2 or arm 3 as a function of time .",
    "this technique effectively creates two two - arm mzis with different spacings between their arms resulting in different gravitational potential differences . therefore a time - varying signal , modulated at the eom frequency , is received at the single - photon detectors ( spd ) and can be extracted by post - selecting data at the frequency of modulation performed by the eom .",
    "the rotational degree of freedom ( e.g. about arm 1 , fig .",
    "[ 3armmzi ] ) is used to calibrate the interferometer in the horizontal position as well as creating an angle dependent signal by slowly rotating the interferometer and performing measurements at fixed positions .",
    "+      to avoid signal fading for different angles in the presence of noise without extinguishing the gravitational information in each of the arms , the following strategy may be applied .",
    "the interferometer can be calibrated in the horizontal position where gravitational differences are absent using a frequency stabilized laser source in arm 1 ( fig .",
    "[ 3armmzi ] ) .",
    "we can operate at the most phase - sensitive point ( quadrature point ) of the mzi by adjusting a phase difference of @xmath17 between arm 1 and arms 2 and 3 . to keep the mzi at this point for all angles and during rotation , the length of each arm",
    "is kept constant by means of an additional , imbalanced mzi consisting of the corresponding fiber spool and a short segment of fiber ( blue lines in fig .",
    "[ 3armmzi ] ) together with a frequency stabilized laser source in each arm .",
    "the length of this segment can be chosen to be as short as possible , so that we can assume the noise to be negligible in the passively isolated , noise reducing vacuum chamber .",
    "this allows to monitor and thus minimize the noise in the long fiber spool , where the vacuum environment minimizes common - mode noise for each of the three additional interferometers .",
    "a linewidth for the stabilizing lasers in the khz regime is required for good visibility in these unbalanced mzis .",
    "the interferometer can now be slowly rotated ( e.g. about arm 1 ) to change the gravitational potential difference in a controlled way . because of the active stabilization provided by the imbalanced mzi in each arm , an observer located at one of the rotated arms will measure a stable path length during the entire rotation .",
    "after fixing the entire setup at a given angle , single photons with frequency different from the lasers are coupled into the interferometer via the first fbs ( fig . [ 3armmzi]c ) .",
    "the single photons will now experience a different gravitational potential depending on which path they take leading to a relative phase shift . single - photon detectors in arms 2 and 3 can be used to resolve this phase difference .",
    "the dynamic eom - modulation together with the controlled ( static ) rotation of the interferometer and the active stabilization preserving the calibration condition , allows us to measure the gravitationally induced phase shift on the single photons . in designing this interferometer",
    "it is crucial to identify all the physical phenomena that could introduce noise that would swamp the gravitational effect we wish to observe .",
    "the rotation of the earth introduces an additional relative phase - shift ( @xmath18 ) between the spools .",
    "the calibration of the interferometer in the horizontal position effectively sets @xmath19 between the different arms equal to zero .",
    "however , as @xmath20 increases , this difference for arms 2 and 3 with respect to arm 1 constantly changes in addition to @xmath21 . we can estimate this effect by assuming the velocity of the photon to be constant as seen by an observer in the laboratory",
    ". we can then calculate ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) the resulting phase - shift between the two outermost arms represented by spools 1 and 3 in fig.[3armmzi ] within the framework of special relativity to be ( up to first order in @xmath22 )    @xmath23    where _ b _ is the radius of the spool , @xmath24 is the ( average ) light speed along the direction of the cylindrical symmetry axis of the spool , @xmath25 is the optical path - length difference and @xmath26 is the ( average ) angular speed of the light circling around the spool . the angles @xmath27 and @xmath20 represent the latitude coordinate of the lab on earth and the spool inclination angle , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spoolgeometry ] .",

    ", @xmath29 defines a vector pointing south at the location of the lab , whereas @xmath30 defines a vector pointing east .",
    "the term linear in @xmath31 in eq . is the usual phase term for standard fiber interferometry , here multiplied by a factor originating from the rotation around the spools axis . because of the expected value for the gravitational phase ( @xmath32 m , @xmath33 m ) we can calculate a bound on the optical path length difference of about @xmath34 m .",
    "the oscillating term contains two functions defined by    , where _ i _ is indexing the corresponding fiber spool . ]",
    "@xmath35    @xmath36    that describe an effect arising from the special geometry of the fiber spools .",
    "the angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 describe the planes in which the photon enters the fiber spool at time @xmath39 in the laboratory frame . from eq . which can be interpreted as a coupling between the rotation of the earth and the rotation around the fiber spool it is easy to observe , that the amplitude is independent of the length _",
    "l _ ( mod @xmath40 ) of the fiber . using @xmath41 m , @xmath42 rad s@xmath43 , @xmath44 m s@xmath43 , @xmath45 nm and @xmath46",
    "we can expect a phase - shift on the order of @xmath47 rad .",
    "comparing @xmath48 to the gravitationally induced phase shift ( eq . ) by taking the same numbers and the effective refractive index to be @xmath49 for a fiber of reasonable length @xmath33 m , we expect @xmath50 to be approximately three orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "fortunately , it is relatively easy to align the geometric angles @xmath38 and @xmath37 to be parallel for all spools . for simplicity",
    "we consider from now on @xmath51 without loss of generality .",
    "we require the effect to be independent of the angle between the fiber spool symmetry axis and the surface normal of the earth ( e.g. between horizontal and vertical position in the laboratory ) , in contrast to the gravitational effect .",
    "this can be done by choosing @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , indicating that the axis of rotation between the vertical and the horizontal position should be parallel to the line connecting the cardinal directions west and east . in this case",
    "@xmath54 , where we defined @xmath55 .",
    "therefore the oscillating term in eq .",
    "reduces to    @xmath56    where the argument in the sine function is periodic with a period of @xmath57 .",
    "the periodicity together with the geometry of the model used for calculating eq . allows for the interpretation of the sine - term as describing the plane perpendicular to the fiber symmetry axis , where the photon leaves the fiber spool .",
    "note that this term only arises because of the geometry of the fiber spool and would not be observable in a straight fiber interferometer . setting an upper bound for the maximal angular displacement between the planes of the spools where the photon can leave by using eqs . and",
    ", we obtain a required stability of about @xmath58rad . with a spool radius of about 0.2 m",
    "this translates to an angular stability of about 7 mdeg . though feasible , this is certainly one of the most challenging parts of the experiment .",
    "this means that in order to not swamp the gravitational effect by the rotation of the earth , all of the three possible input planes ( described by the @xmath59 ) and all of the three possible output planes ( described by @xmath31 and _ b _ ) must not change more than 7 mdeg during rotation from the horizontal where this effect is not present due to calibration to the vertical .",
    "nm and a total length of @xmath60 km .",
    "the used fiber parameters are : thermal conductivity @xmath61 w mk@xmath43 , refractive index temperature coefficient @xmath62 k@xmath43 , effective refractive index @xmath63 , coefficient of linear expansion @xmath64 k@xmath43 , thermal diffusivity @xmath65 m@xmath9 s@xmath43 , mode - field radius @xmath66 @xmath67 m and fiber outer radius @xmath68 @xmath67 m . ]",
    "another factor that limits the sensitivity and stability of any fiber interferometer is internal noise originating from thermal properties of the fiber itself @xcite .",
    "external noise , mainly from temperature fluctuations , air currents and acoustic noise can be greatly reduced by housing the fiber - spool inside an evacuated chamber , shielded additionally from acoustic noise by active vibration isolating systems .",
    "in fact , without this shielding it has been shown to be impossible to measure a meaningful signal due to signal fading @xcite . in most applications for short - scale fiber interferometry ,",
    "the shot noise limit sets a lower bound on the phase - sensitivity of an interferometer . for",
    "large - scale fiber interferometers , intrinsic thermal noise of the transmissive medium itself can limit the performance , and must be carefully analysed for the application at hand .",
    "there are several theoretical investigations attempting to model the observed noise floors for optical fiber interferometers . the measured power spectral density ( psd ) for typical fibers used in optical fiber sensing ( see e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "has a @xmath69 dependence in the low frequency regime , which shows good agreement with theories for mechanical dissipation in optical fibers ( @xcite ) . for frequencies over 1 khz",
    ", the psd curve shows excellent agreement with another theory for thermal phase noise by wanser @xcite .",
    "the psd has a rapid cut - off for fourier frequencies above 100 khz , indicating a lower noise contribution in this frequency regime .",
    "the root - mean - square amplitude of phase noise fluctuations depends strongly on the geometry and material of the fiber . using the fiber parameters for corning s standard single mode fiber smf-28 @xcite ,",
    "the noise contribution from intrinsic thermal phase noise for an interferometer with total length @xmath60 km can be estimated to be around @xmath15 rad hz@xmath70 at 100 khz according to wanser s theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : internalfibernoise ] ) . a better estimation for this bound",
    "can only be given by measuring the crucial parameters for the fiber actually used in this experiment .",
    "one can see , that the thermal noise contribution can be tailored by an appropriate choice of signal band - pass filtering at the detectors and proper choice of the modulation frequency with the os .",
    "passive stabilization by noise damping foundations and vacuum environment are necessary for keeping external noise contributions to a minimum .",
    "this might also reduce the need for an active stabilization loop for the short fiber segments connecting the three arms of the interferometer ( orange lines in fig .",
    "[ 3armmzi ] ) .",
    "active stabilization of the fibers performed by the imbalanced mzis in each arm keeps the interferometer at the desired quadrature , independent of the inclination angle @xmath20 .",
    "optical fiber interferometers are also sensitive to polarization effects @xcite .",
    "the states - of - polarization ( sop ) of the two interferometer arm outputs determine the mixing efficiency at the merging beam splitter , where perfect polarization overlap occurs for parallel sops resulting in a maximal visibility @xcite .",
    "the proposed setup relies on rotation around one of the arms of the mzi , so special care must be taken to preserve perfect mixing and avoid polarization drifts and rotations .",
    "one possible approach to overcoming drifts in polarization is to use polarization - maintaining ( pm ) fibers .",
    "the main disadvantages of using pm fibers are the much higher transmission losses ( @xmath71 db/(km nm ) instead of @xmath72 db/(km nm ) ) and the much higher costs .",
    "therefore it is most practical to use standard single - mode fibers with an active stabilization of the polarization in each arm @xcite .",
    "the required quality of this stabilization depends mainly on the chosen frequency of the optical switch .",
    "+ because we are aiming for measuring small optical phase shifts with large scale fiber interferometers , dispersive effects might also be of great importance .",
    "we assume the single - photon states to have gaussian spectral amplitude @xcite @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the variance of the spectral intensity and @xmath75 is the central frequency of the pulse . allowing for pulses to evolve differently in distinct fibers we can rewrite the detection probability ( eq . ) for a conventional mzi as ( appendix [ appendixb ] )    @xmath76    where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the initial temporal width of the photon .",
    "the time - domain broadening is given by @xmath79 with @xmath80 representing the dispersion coefficient ( ps/(km nm ) ) , _ l _ the length of the fiber ( km ) and @xmath81 representing the spectral width ( nm ) .",
    "the prime in eq . indicates the second fiber with different material coefficient .",
    "the gaussian pre - factor depends on the ratio between path difference , represented by the gravitational phase shift , and pulse length represented by the broadening of the initial pulse in the time domain .",
    "it can be shown by using eq . that the dispersion broadening results in an effect that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational phase shift for photons with spectral width achievable in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "thus dispersion is not a limiting factor in the proposed experiment .",
    "while the interferometer s path lengths should be as large as possible to increase the relative gravitational phase difference between the arms , longer optical fiber paths also introduce more noise and reduce transmission , thus increasing the integration time required for statistically significant measurements . in this setup",
    ", the gravitational phase can be resolved by means of a difference in count rates as a function of @xmath20 and the modulation frequency of the optical switch . to determine an upper bound on the required integration time , we assume the single photon source to possess photon statistics following a poisson distribution at the detectors after passing through the fibers . in order to be visible over the poissonian noise ,",
    "the difference in photon counts due to gravity should be at least @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the average number of photons registered by the @xmath84 detector per time t. because the optical switch directs the photons either along arm 2 or arm 3 , the set - up reduces to a conventional mach - zehnder interferometer , where the difference in gravitational potential can be seen as phase change modulated by a phase - shifter .",
    "the amplitude in this model is proportional to the potential difference between arms 2 and 3 and the modulation frequency is given by the one of the eom .",
    "the integration time of the detectors can thus be estimated by ( see appendix [ appendixc ] )    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the number of photons per unit time provided by the single photon source , @xmath87 is the quantum efficiency of the detector , @xmath88 is the dark count rate and @xmath89 is the overall attenuation factor of the interferometer with @xmath90 the attenuation coefficient of the optical fiber , @xmath91 the length ( m ) of the horizontal arms of the mzi and the @xmath59 are the various attenuation coefficients of the fiber optic components used in the interferometer .",
    "the detection probability for the detector in question at an angle @xmath20 at the quadrature point is denoted by @xmath92 .",
    "the detection probability for the horizontalposition ( @xmath93 ) , where gravity has no effect , is denoted by @xmath94 . because of the large area needed to observe even a small gravitational phase shift , it is desirable to work at a wavelength where the optical fibers have high transmission . for standard single - mode fibers",
    "this is usually around a wavelength of @xmath95 nm . to achieve high quantum efficiencies and low dark count rates for photon detection at this particular wavelength , superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors ( snspds )",
    "may be used . the dark count rate for snspds",
    "have been shown to be as low as 1 hz for detectors with quantum efficiency @xmath96 @xcite . because the integration time is inversely proportional to @xmath86 ,",
    "a single - photon source with high brightness is beneficial .",
    "spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in non - linear crystals is one of the most versatile and reliable technologies to produce single - photon states of light .",
    "the last 20 years have witnessed significant technological improvements in the performance of such sources , which can now reach brightnesses of up to @xmath8 pairs/(s ghz ) per mw of pump with typical bandwidths of the order of 100 ghz @xcite . by inserting the non - linear crystal in an optical cavity ,",

    "optical fiber interferometry is a promising technique for table - top experiments aimed at measuring gravitationally induced phase shifts on single photons .",
    "here we have presented a scheme for overcoming the static nature of the gravitational interaction by exploiting a modified mach - zehnder interferometer .",

    "we have shown that by adding an unbalanced mzi in each arm of the mzi , the calibration condition can be preserved during rotation .",
