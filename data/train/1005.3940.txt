    "the investigation of thermoelectric phenomena in nanoscale devices at low temperatures has several interesting aspects . from the practical point of view , it is important to understand the heat flow and the dissipation because the heat generated by electric potentials used to switch - on transport currents inevitably induces decoherence in the quantum functioning of the device and also leads to dissipation . in bulk conductors ,",
    "thermoelectric transport necessitates an asymmetry between holes and electrons , which is usually small . in mesoscopic structures",
    "this asymmetry may be fairly high and can be also controlled experimentally .",
    "one would hence like to have a full picture of the symmetries and the inter - relations dominating the various transport coefficients of a small mesoscopic system , in particular the effects of inelastic processes .",
    "indeed , when transport is through a molecular bridge , the tunneling electrons may undergo inelastic collisions with the vibrational modes even in the linear - response regime .",
    "this is because at finite temperatures the transport electrons may excite or de - excite the phonons and thus exchange energy with them .",
    "these inelastic processes modify the electronic transport coefficients , leading to the question of what , if any , are the analogues of the ( bulk ) onsager - casimir relations .",
    "another intriguing issue is the possibility to convert heat from the vibrations into an electric current between the electronic reservoirs , or vice - versa .",
    "early studies of thermoelectric transport coefficients of microstructures were based on the landauer approach @xcite which was also extended to include mesoscopic superconductors .",
    "@xcite once feasibility of measuring thermal and thermoelectric transport in atomic - scale samples had been established , @xcite mesoscopic thermoelectric phenomena , e.g. , peaks in the thermopower of a point contact orchestrated with the transitions among plateaux of the quantized conductance , @xcite or oscillations ( as a function of a gate voltage ) in the same coefficient measured on a quantum dot @xcite , were detected and analyzed .",
    "@xcite the thermopower measured on nanotubes was found to be unexpectedly high , and this was attributed to a broken electron - hole symmetry .",
    "@xcite similarly , nanotubes exhibited enhanced thermal conductivity , @xcite as did also silicon nanowires .",
    "@xcite the dependence of the thermoelectric response on the length of the atomic chain has been recently computed within density - functional theory .",
    "@xcite being based on the landauer approach , the above - mentioned theoretical studies mainly focused on elastic processes of the transport electrons .",
    "later on , effects of inelastic electron - electron processes and electronic correlations ( increasingly important at lower temperatures ) , as well as that of an applied magnetic field , on the thermopower produced in large @xcite and single - level @xcite quantum dots , and also in quantum wires @xcite were considered .",
    "the effect of attractive electronic interactions on the thermopower was considered in ref .  .",
    "inelasticity of electronic processes should play a significant role in thermoelectric transport through molecular bridges , also in the nonlinear regime .",
    "@xcite indeed , a density - functional computation of the nonlinear differential conductance of gold wires attributed changes in the i - v characteristics to phonon heating , @xcite and the thermopower coefficient was proposed as a tool to monitor the excitation spectrum of a molecule forming the junction between two leads . @xcite it was suggested that the seebeck effect in such bridges can be used for converting heat into electric energy @xcite , and to determine the location of the fermi level of the transport electrons relative to the molecular levels , and also the sign of the dominant charge carriers , either for a molecular conductor , @xcite or for an atomic chain .",
    "@xcite this was confirmed experimentally : the seebeck coefficient as measured by stm yielded that in the case of the benzenedithiol family sandwiched between two gold electrodes the charge carriers are holes passing through the homo , whose location with respect to the metal fermi level was determined from the magnitude of the coefficient .",
    "@xcite    inelastic electron - vibration interactions are not included in several of the theoretical studies devoted to molecular junctions ( see , e.g. , refs .  ,  , and  ) or are treated at off - resonance conditions , expanding them in the molecular - lead coupling .",
    "@xcite when these interactions are ignored , the transport coefficients have the same functional form as in bulk conductors , with the energy - dependent transmission coefficient and its derivative replacing the conductivity . @xcite notwithstanding the relative smallness , often , of the inelastic corrections to the thermoelectric transport , their study is still of interest because of fundamental questions related to the symmetries of the conventional transport coefficients , and since they give rise to additional coefficients connecting the heat transport in - between the electrons and the phonons .     and @xmath0 , respectively . an electron residing on the level interacts with its vibrational modes .",
    "the population of these phonons can be determined by the transport electrons ( a  floating molecule \" ) or by a coupling to a phonon source kept at temperature @xmath1 .",
    ", width=264 ]    here we study the heat and charge transport in a small mesoscopic ( or nanometric ) system depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ sys ] : a molecule attached to two electronic ( no phonons ) reservoirs , held in general at different temperatures , @xmath2 , and at different chemical potentials , @xmath3 .",
    "we distinguish between two ( extreme ) situations . in the first , the molecule is  floating \" and is attached solely to the leads ; then the vibration population is determined by the transport electrons alone . in that case , the system is a two - terminal junction . in the second case ,",
    "the molecule is coupled to its own ( typically a phonon- ) heat bath which is kept at the temperature @xmath1 , making the system a three - terminal one .",
    "it is then assumed implicitly that the coupling of the molecule to that heat bath largely exceeds its coupling to the transport electrons .",
    "the latter is determined by our small parameter , the coupling between the molecule vibrations and the transport electrons , @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we assume that the relaxation time due to the coupling to the heat bath , @xmath5 , is short on the scale @xmath6 [ see eq .",
    "( [ phe ] ) in appendix [ detcal ] ] , @xmath7 being the level width on the molecule , due to the coupling with the leads and @xmath8 is the frequency of the vibrations .",
    "@xmath9 may still be very small on all other physical scales , such as @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "the phonon bath may be realized simply by an electronically insulating hard substrate ( assuming that the large kapitsa - type phonon thermal resistance between the lead and the sample is large enough to sufficiently reduce the thermal contact of the molecule to the substrate via the leads ) , or a piece of such material touching the junction , each of those held at a temperature @xmath1 .",
    "a vacuum gap between the two _ separate _ substrates for the two leads would be ideal .",
    "however , with present fabrication technology , this appears possible for a quantum dot but not for a small molecule .",
    "the consideration of the entropy production of such a three - terminal system is quite illuminating .",
    "using the thermodynamic identity @xmath11 , @xcite one finds that the dissipation at the left ( right ) reservoir leads to @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is energy current emerging from the left ( right ) reservoir , while @xmath14 is the particle current leaving the left ( right ) reservoir . adding to eqs .",

    "@xcite    since our molecular bridge is not necessarily at equilibrium within the transport process , it exchanges energy with the phonons of the phonon reservoir by going up / down in the vibrational ladder with absorbing / emitting a phonon in the bath .",
    "this is the physical origin of the current @xmath16 . on the other hand , when the molecule is floating , then @xmath16 vanishes .",
    "since @xmath16 is proportional to the rate of change of the vibrational level population on the dot ( see appendix [ detcal ] for details ) this in turn will determine the vibration population that will adjust itself according to the temperature and chemical potential differences applied to the electrons .",
    "in this situation our device becomes a two - temrinal one , and the energy current carried by the electrons is conserved .    in sec .",
    "[ curs ] we outline our model , and give explicit expressions for all three currents @xmath23 , @xmath25 , and @xmath16 , and in sec . [ linres ] we discuss them in the linear - response regime .",
    "in particular , we find there that by the three - terminal junction , one may convert the heat current from the phonon bath into electric and heat currents carried by the electrons even at zero bias voltage and when @xmath28 . in sec . [ 2 t ] we discuss the necessary conditions for this conversion to be established , i.e. , the junction couplings to the electronic reservoirs should not be spatially - symmetric and should not depend on the energy in an identical manner .",
    "we show that an opposite dependence on energy of the couplings to two electron reservoirs will tend to maximize the new transport coefficients we find .",
    "in our analysis , the molecular bridge is replaced by a single resonant level ; when a transport electron resides on the level , it interacts ( linearly ) with the phonons .",
    "such a model , which neglects effects of spin and electronic correlations , is applicable in the coulomb blockade regime for low - energy molecular levels .",
