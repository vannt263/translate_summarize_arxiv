    "the basic sample resulted from a cross - correlation of the rosat all - sky survey and the green bank 5ghz radio survey ( 87 gb ; condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this so - called rgb - sample contains more than 2100 radio - loud x - ray sources and was completely followed - up with the vla to obtain accurate radio positions and radio core fluxes ( brinkmann et al .",

    "- rays nls1 generally exhibit rapid variability and steep x - ray spectra ( e.g. boller et al .",
    "@xcite ; brandt et al .",
    "@xcite ; leighly @xcite , @xcite ) . whether or not the x - ray and optical properties of nls1",
    "galaxies are affected by orientation is currently the subject of much debate ( e.g. osterbrock & pogge @xcite ; brandt et al .",
    "@xcite ; boller et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "originally it was suggested that nls1 are the pole - on versions of regular seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "this naturally explains the narrower permitted emission lines , if the emission line clouds were confined to a disk perpendicular to the symmetry axis .",
    "orientation dependent emission line properties have also been discussed for other object classes ( e.g. boroson @xcite ; baker & hunstead @xcite ) .",
    "the high frequency of soft x - ray excesses seen in nls1 ( e.g. leighly @xcite ) also might argue for a face - on orientation , at least in the case of geometrically thick accretion discs ( madau @xcite ) .",
    "further arguments in favor of pole - on geometries are the strong fe ii emission , if it originates in the accretion disc ( e.g. kwan et al .",
    "1995 ) and the low frequency of warm absorbers in nls1 ( leighly @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the observed rapid variability as well as absorption features near 1 kev in three nls1 might be explained by relativistic outflows seen close to the line of sight ( boller et al .",
    "@xcite ; leighly et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the orientation model would require the hard x - ray spectral index to be orientation dependent , since it is much flatter in broad - line seyferts than in nls1 .",
    "however , current models for the x - ray emission processes predict the opposite behavior ( e.g. haardt & maraschi @xcite ) .",
    "further , the extreme variability in iras 13224 - 3809 can be explained by relativistic effects connected with a hot spot at the inner edge of an accretion disc seen under a large inclination angle .",
    "finally , the presence of excess absorption by cold material in the nls1 mrk 507 ( iwasawa et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the observation of ionization cones in mrk 766 ( wilson et al .",
    "@xcite ) argue against a general pole - on orientation for nls1 .    instead",
    ", it has been proposed that nls1 galaxies are objects with smaller black hole masses and accretion rates closer to the eddington limit compared to broad - line seyferts .",
    "this scenario naturally explains many of their peculiar optical and x - ray properties ( pounds et al .",
    "@xcite ; leighly @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "radio - loud nls1 appear to be a rare class of agn .",
    "apart from there is only one object known , namely .",
    "the importance of radio - loud nls1 galaxies lies in the fact that the presence of radio emission and an associated relativistic jet might give us an independent handle on the orientation issue .",
    "hence , the main intention of our asca observation was to compare the x - ray properties of the radio - loud nls1 to radio - quiet nls1 and to investigate , whether any differences in the x - ray spectrum can be attributed to the radio - loud nature of this object .",
    "the spectrum of shown in laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and on which its nls1 classification is based , did not extend far enough to the red to include h@xmath4 .",
    "we therefore obtained a second spectrum on sept .   24 , 1998 at lick observatory using the kast double spectrograph .",
    "two 20 minute exposures were taken to facilitate accurate cosmic ray rejection and the resulting averaged spectrum has a resolution of 3.8  and a coverage from 3410 to 8270  ( 2900 to 7000  in the object s rest frame ) .",
    "weather was variable , but generally poor during the observations .",
    "therefore the flux scale should be taken only as a rough indicator of the source s brightness .",
    "atmospheric lines were removed using an observation of a spectrophotometric standard star .",
    "the observations of both source and standard star were done with the slit rotated to the parallactic angle .",
    "we did not correct for reddening since the measured h@xmath4/h@xmath5 ratio is consistent with no reddening .",
    "the optical spectrum of appears to be extremely blue ( fig .",
    "[ optb ] ) . even when the contributions from the balmer continuum , blended fe emission and possibly mgii are taken into account , the continuum below 5000 is still steeper than the limit for a bare accretion disk spectrum ( @xmath6 ; e.g. grupe et al .",
    "this may indicate the presence of additional line emission , perhaps from fe  i ( e.g. kwan et al .",
    "1995 ) , or scattering of a blue intrinsic continuum .",
    "if we restrict our measurement of the continuum to the region redward of 5000 , we find that a power law with a slope ] of @xmath7 yields a good fit . for wavelengths blueward of 5000",
    ", we formally get a slope of @xmath8 .    to our knowledge , this is bluest optical continuum of any nls1 observed to date .",
    "it might be speculated that this peculiarity is related to the radio - loudness of rgbj0044 + 193 , for example via optical synchrotron emission from the putative radio jet .",
    "however , the spectral shape practically rules out a synchrotron contribution to the blue optical continuum .",
    "we further note that the optical continuum of the only other known radio - loud nls1 pks 0558 - 504 is not as blue as that of ( remillard et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the emission line spectrum confirms the original classification as a nls1 galaxy at redshift of z=0.181 .",
    "the broad permitted blend of feii emission commonly present in nls1s severely contaminates the spectrum , making an accurate measurement of the flux and width , in particular of the h@xmath5 and [ oiii ] lines difficult . in order to account for this",
    ", we employ the feii subtraction method introduced by boroson & green ( @xcite ) and now commonly applied ( e.g. leighly @xcite ) .",
    "the feii emission line spectrum from a high signal - to - noise optical spectrum of the prototype strong fe emitter i zw 1 is first convolved with a gaussian and then scaled until the width and intensity of the lines approximately match those seen in the spectrum .",
    "we find that a 980 km s@xmath3 fwhm gaussian convolution with a normalization 8% of the absolute flux of i zw 1 provides the best fit ( see fig .",
    "[ opt ] ) .",
    "this best - fitting feii model was then subtracted and the remaining emission lines examined .",
    "h@xmath5 has a lorentzian rather than a gaussian profile , which is typical of the nls1 class ( goncalves et al .",
    "1998 ) . a lorentzian profile with a fwhm of @xmath91330 km",
    "s@xmath3 yields an excellent fit .",
    "h@xmath4 is blended with [ nii ] , but also shows clear indications of a broad component .",
    "our best fit lorentzian profile yields a fwhm of 1000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "considering the degree of blending near h@xmath4 , this is fully consistent with the dynamics exhibited by the h@xmath5 line .",
    "the forbidden [ oiii ] lines are well fit by a gaussian of fwhm @xmath9750 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this behavior is typical for nls1s : the broad and narrow components of the permitted lines can not be clearly separated , but the fwhm is @xmath102000 km s@xmath3 , while the forbidden lines are well - fit by a single narrow component .",
    "the final pieces of optical evidence , which support the classification of as a nls1 are the intensity ratios of the high ionization lines ( [ oiii ] , [ nii ] ) to the low ionization lines ( h@xmath5 , h@xmath4 ) . because the h@xmath4/[nii ] emission feature is strongly blended , we can not determine an accurate flux ratio , but we can confidently say that [ nii]/h@xmath4@xmath100.4 . for [ oiii]/h@xmath5 we derive a value of 0.2 .",
    "both these measurements are consistent with the low values typical for other nls1 galaxies ( osterbrock & pogge @xcite ; goodrich @xcite ) , and significantly lower than those exhibited by quasars , where [ oiii]/h@xmath5@xmath113.0 and [ nii]/h@xmath4@xmath110.75 .",
    "applying the criterium of kellerman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who define r = 10 as the dividing line between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , the source is radio - loud , since the ratio of the total 4.85ghz radio flux from the 87 gb survey ( @xmath12 = 24 mjy ) and the optical magnitude ( @xmath13 ) is @xmath14 .",
    "the radio flux corresponds to a luminosity = 50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath15 .",
    "] of @xmath16 whz@xmath3 .",
    "thus , also using luminosity criteria ( e.g. joly 1991 ; miller et al .",
    "1993 ) , should be classified as a radio - loud agn .    in general ,",
    "nls1 galaxies are considered to be radio - quiet agn .",
    "ulvestad et al .",
    "( @xcite ) investigated the radio emission of 15 nls1 galaxies with the vla down to a flux limit of 0.25 mjy at 5ghz .",
    "they found luminosities ( or upper limits ) between @xmath17 w hz@xmath3 and @xmath18 w hz@xmath3 .",
    "thus , is about two orders of magnitude brighter at 4.85ghz than any of the objects in the sample of ulvestad et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . comparing the radio - loudness r of to that of the ulvestad et al .",
    "( @xcite ) sources , we again find that it is a factor of @xmath96 higher than any of those .",
    "even if we use the lower flux from the vla measurement ( see below ) r is higher by a factor of two .",
    "however , in this case r@xmath1010 and hence is technically radio - quiet ( but confer discussion below ) .",
    "there is only one other radio - loud nls1 galaxy known up to now ( pks 0558 - 504 ) and we compare it to in sect.7.1 .",
    "the radio luminosity of is much larger than usually detected in normal galaxies or starbursts .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , for example , study the 20 most radio luminous starburst galaxies from the ugc sample .",
    "the average 4.85 ghz luminosity of this sample is @xmath19 , and even the radio brightest object is more than a factor of five less luminous than rgb0044 + 193 .",
    "therefore , any significant contribution to the total radio emission other than non - thermal radiation from a radio jet seems rather unlikely .",
    "interestingly , was detected with a 4.85ghz flux of only 7 mjy in the high resolution follow - up observation with the vla ( laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "this indicates that the source is either extended or variable .",
    "the latter is supported by two additional pieces of evidence : firstly , the radio source appears unresolved on the vla map and secondly , it is not detected in the nrao / vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) at 1.4ghz , which is sensitive down to @xmath9 2.5 mjy . given that extended radio emission generally shows steep radio spectra , the 1.4ghz radio flux should have been higher than 7 mjy and hence easily detectable in the nvss .",
    "unfortunately , existing radio data do not allow us to place limits on the likelihood for large intrinsic radio variability in nls1 galaxies as a class .",
    "even in the case of the true amount of intrinsic variability is uncertain , since the sense of the differences between the 87 gb and the vla measurements is the same as if overresolution were a problem . due to the compactness of the radio source interstellar scintillation",
    "might also be relevant .",
    "if taken at face value , the data also imply an inverted spectrum between 4.85 and 1.4 ghz , probably due to synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "this would be consistent with the observed unresolved compact radio core .",
    "note that neither pks 0558 - 504 nor the ulvestad et al .",

    "@xcite ) in 1-ccd faint mode from january 9 , 08:55:23 to january 10 , 23:49:13 ( ut ) 1998 .",
    "the data were analysed using ftools 4.1 .",
    "the recommended standard screening criteria were applied to the data . for the gis",
    "the minimum elevation angle above the earth s limb ( elv ) was chosen to be @xmath20 . in the case of the sis we used elv@xmath21 . to avoid atmospheric contamination ,",
    "data were only accepted in the sis when the angle between the target and the bright earth ( br_earth ) was greater than @xmath22 .",
    "further , a minimum cut - off rigidity ( cor ) of 6 gev / c was applied for both , the sis and the gis .",
    "data taken within 60 seconds after passage of the day - night - terminator and the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) were not considered in the analysis .",
    "periods of high background were manually excluded from the data by checking the light curve of the observation .",
    "the resulting effective exposures were 47.9 ksec for each gis and 45.1 and 46.4 ksec for sis0 and sis1 , respectively .",
    "source counts were extracted from a circular region centered on the target with a radius of @xmath23 for the gis and @xmath24 for the sis .",
    "we used the local background determined from the observation in the analysis for both detectors .",
    "in particular , the gis background was estimated from a source free region at the same off - axis angle as the source and with the same size as the source extraction region . in total",
    ", @xmath92500 counts were detected from in each of the sis detectors .",
    "because of the steep spectrum and the lower effective area , the number of photons detected with the gis detectors was a about factor of two smaller .",
    "all spectra were rebinned to have at least 20 photons in each energy channel .",
    "this allows the use of the @xmath25 technique to obtain the best fit values for the model spectra .",
    "we used the latest gis redistribution matrices available ( v4_0 ) from the calibration database and created the sis response matrices for our observation using sisrmg , which applies the latest charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) table ( sisph2pi_110397.fits ) .",
    "the ancillary response files for all four detectors were generated using the ascaarf program .",
    "spectra were fitted in the energy range 0.8 to 8 kev for both gis . for sis0 and sis1",
    "we used 0.5 to 7 kev and 0.7 to 7 kev , respectively .",
    "the upper energy boundaries are given by the maximum energy at which the source was detected in each instrument .",
    "the lower energy boundaries result from the calibration uncertainties of the detectors .",
    "in particular , sis1 recently shows systematic residuals below 0.6 kev ( dotani et al .",
    "@xcite ) . also , since the ccd temperature of sis1 was higher than sis0 during the observation , we decided to ignore the data below 0.7 kev for sis1 .",
    "an increasing rdd ( residual dark distribution ) , which is caused by radiation damage , has been reported for both ccds .",
    "this effect can not be corrected for with currently available software .",
    "rdd degradation should be negligible for 1-ccd observations , however ( dotani et al .",
    "since the spectral fitting for the individual detectors gives consistent results , we only cite the parameters for all four detectors fitted simultaneously in the following .",
    "the normalization of the gis detectors was allowed to vary with respect to the sis , because of the known cross - calibration uncertainties .",
    "the resulting differences in the normalization between the sis and the gis detectors are of the order of 5 to 10% .",
    "we first investigated a simple power law model with the absorption fixed to the galactic value ( n@xmath26 @xmath27 ) .",
    "the resulting best fit parameters are @xmath28 and @xmath25 = 405.5 ( 360 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the ratio of the data to this model is shown in fig .",
    "it can clearly be seen that there is a significant break in the spectrum of around 1.8 kev .",
    "next we fitted the spectrum with a broken power law model . to put tighter constraints on the break energy and the low energy power law , we first fitted a simple power law model to the data above 2 kev and fixed the resulting high energy power law ( @xmath29 ) in the broken power law fit .",
    "this gives @xmath30 , @xmath31 kev and @xmath25 = 386.5 ( 359 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the difference in @xmath25 is significant at more than 99.9% confidence according to a f  test .",
    "an even better fit results when a blackbody model superimposed on a simple power law is applied instead of a broken power law . using zbbody",
    "we get ( again for fixed galactic absorption ) t = 0.19@xmath320.02 kev for a power law photon index of @xmath33 ( fixed ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath25 is 382.6 for 359 degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting ratio of data to model is shown in fig .",
    "[ bb ] . for this model",
    "we get a 210 kev flux of @xmath34 erg@xmath27s@xmath3 , which gives a rest frame 210 kev luminosity of @xmath35 erg s@xmath3 . the corresponding soft x - ray ( 0.5 - 2 kev )",
    "luminosity is @xmath36 erg s@xmath3 .    alternatively ,",
    "if we use a thermal bremsstrahlung model ( zbremss ) instead of a blackbody , we also get an acceptable fit and the best fitting parameters are t = 0.45@xmath37 kev , @xmath33 ( fixed ) and @xmath38 ( 359 d.o.f . ) .",
    "we note that leaving the photon index as a free parameter in these models gives values that are consistent with the photon index determined at higher energies .",
    "we do not detect any indication of absorption edges due to o vii and oviii and the upper limits on the optical depths are @xmath39(ovii)@xmath40 and @xmath39 ( oviii)@xmath41 . we also searched for a k@xmath4 emission line from neutral or ionized iron , but could not find any .",
    "due to the low photon statistics at high energies the upper limits on the equivalent widths are not very stringent : 250 ev and 400 ev for a narrow emission line at 6.4 and 6.7 kev , respectively .",
    "the background subtracted light curve of in the 0.57.0 kev energy range during the asca observation is shown in fig .",

    "the data were binned in such a way that each data point corresponds to one orbit of the satellite . for clarity , only the combined sis0/sis1 light curve is shown , but we note that the same qualitative behavior is also seen in the gis detectors .",
    "the source count rate was clearly higher at the beginning of the observation .",
    "it decreased by a factor of two within one day .",
    "there is also evidence for significant variability on much shorter time scales , albeit with smaller amplitudes .    in the rosat",
    "all - sky survey was detected with a pspc count rate of @xmath42 counts s@xmath3 . using a power law model with @xmath43 , this results in an unabsorbed 0.1 - 2.4 kev flux of @xmath44 erg @xmath27 s@xmath3 .",
    "this value is consistent with the corresponding asca flux for the broken power law model in the same energy range ( @xmath45 erg @xmath27 s@xmath3 ) .",
    "a common measure of agn x - ray variability is the excess variance @xmath46 ( nandra et al .",
    "@xcite ; leighly @xcite ) .",
    "basically it measures the variance of the light curve minus the variance due to the measurement errors . for exposures of similar duration",
    "it is also a measure of the variability time scale . in the case of we calculate @xmath47 , which is significantly higher than the values found for broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies of similar x - ray luminosity , but consistent with the values found for other nls1s ( leighly @xcite ) .",

    "the asca spectra of the two radio - loud nls1 galaxies are remarkably similar .",
    "leighly ( 1999 ) finds a slightly higher temperature ( kt @xmath54 0.25 kev ) for the blackbody model and a slightly steeper hard photon index ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "interestingly , the spectrum of pks 0558 - 504 also shows marginal evidence for an emission line around 6.7 kev with an equivalent width of about 100 ev , which is well below the upper limit for rgbj0044 + 193 , however .",
    "it was shown by brandt et al .",

    "4 .   the asca sis count rate decreases by a factor of two within one day and there is evidence for variability with lower amplitude on much smaller time scales .",
    "the variability behavior is characterized by an excess variance of 0.045@xmath320.014 .    both the spectrum and the variability properties are typical for nls1 galaxies , which provides independent evidence for the classification of rgbj0044 + 193 .",

    "<S> narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies are generally found to be radio - quiet and there was only one radio - loud object known so far ( pks 0558 - 504 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we present the results of a 50 ksec asca observation of the recently discovered second radio - loud nls1 galaxy rgbj0044 + 193 . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray data are complemented by radio observations and a new optical spectrum for this source .    </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for variable radio emission and an inverted radio spectrum of rgbj0044 + 193 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical continuum turned out to be extremely blue . </S>",
    "<S> this may either indicate additional line emission , for example from fei , or scattering of a blue intrinsic continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum shows a clear break around 1.8 kev . above this energy the spectrum is characterized by a power law with a photon index of @xmath0 . for energies below 2 kev </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is much softer and it can either be modeled with a steeper power law ( @xmath1 ) or a blackbody component with a temperature around 0.2 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray count rate of the source decreased by a factor of two within one day and there is evidence for low amplitude variability on much shorter time scales . given its average 210 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , is significantly more variable than a typical broad line seyfert 1 galaxy of comparable x - ray luminosity , but consistent with the bulk of nls1 galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral as well as the variability properties of are indistinguishable from those of radio - quiet nls1s . in particular , we find no evidence for a flat x - ray component due to inverse compton emission related to the putative non - thermal radio emission from rgbj0044 + 193 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue , however , that this does not rule out a pole - on orientation for rgbj0044 + 193 . </S>"
