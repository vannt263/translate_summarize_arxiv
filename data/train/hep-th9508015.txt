    "the @xmath9 expansion of matrix - valued field theories is probably the most important non - perturbative and non - numerical theoretical tool presently available in the study of such models as non - abelian gauge theories and two - dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "a resolution of the above - mentioned models in the large-@xmath0 limit would be the starting point for many analytical developments .",
    "in particular when a lattice formulation is involved one must consider different possibilities in the search for the continuum limit ; for the case of asymptotically free theories one must explore the limit of vanishing coupling @xmath10 ( trivial fixed point ) while keeping a physical mass scale fixed , while in the case of quantum gravity one must search for a nontrivial fixed point @xmath11 and reach the limit with a specific power - law dependence on @xmath0 of @xmath12 , which is known as `` double scaling limit ''  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is useful to achieve a full knowledge of the coupling dependence of such models , from extreme weak coupling to strong coupling , in order to explore those regions that may turn out to be physically most interesting .    as a matter of fact , notwithstanding many recent efforts toward an understanding of the possible properties of large-@xmath0 solutions to nontrivial quantum field theories , our present analytical knowledge is limited to a small number of few - matrix systems .",
    "this number is even smaller if we restrict our attention to the case of unitary matrix fields , which is especially relevant to the problem of lattice qcd . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only solved examples are gross - witten s single - link problem  @xcite and its generalizations , the external field problem  @xcite and @xmath13 chiral chains  @xcite .",
    "we stress that extending the number of solved few - matrix systems is not at all a pointless exercise .",
    "indeed apart from purely theoretical informations that might be achieved , not only does every few - matrix system have a reinterpretation , via the double scaling limit , as some different kind of matter coupled to 2-dimensional quantum gravity , but also every few - matrix system involving unitary matrices can be reinterpreted as the generating functional for a class of integrals over unitary groups , and these integrals in turn are the essential missing ingredient in the context of a complete algorithmization of the strong coupling expansion of many interesting models  @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we may introduce the notion of a `` superskeleton '' , that is a graph whose vertices are joined by at most one link ( simple graph ) . as has been shown , knowledge of all the group integrals involved in the strong coupling expansion of a lattice model with nearest - neighbor interactions defined on such a graph provides sufficient information for the algorithmic reconstruction of the strong coupling series for a model enjoying the same global symmetry and defined on an arbitrary lattice .",
    "these were basic motivations for us to begin the study of the class of lattice chiral models which we termed `` simplicial chiral models ''  @xcite .",
    "in particular we focused on principal chiral models , with a global @xmath14 symmetry , defined on a @xmath1 dimensional simplex formed by connecting @xmath5 vertices by @xmath15 links , and explored specifically the large-@xmath0 limit of such models , whose relevance we have just been discussing .",
    "our fundamental result is the reduction of the above problem to that of solving a single inhomogeneous integral equation for the eigenvalue distribution of a single hermitian semi - positive definite matrix . although we could not find a closed form solution to this equation for arbitrary @xmath5 , we are able to solve it in several interesting special cases and we set up a systematic numerical approach to the solutions which led us to a conjecture about the location of the critical surface as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "we have also studied in detail the related topic of chiral chains , their strong coupling expansion and critical behavior . as a result of these analyses , we are confident that the critical surface is defined by @xmath16 for all @xmath5 .    moreover , by treating @xmath5 as a continuous parameter , there are two distinct regions . for small @xmath5 , @xmath17 , the models exhibit the third order gross - witten transition .",
    "indeed for @xmath18 they coincide exactly with the chiral chains studied earlier by brower , rossi and tan  @xcite . in this region ,",
    "the criticality is related to that of @xmath19 spin models on random surfaces , as discussed by gaudin - kostov  @xcite . for @xmath20 , however , there is a first order transition ending at the `` upper critical '' dimensions @xmath21 , which we scrutinize in some detail .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :    * in section  [ matrix ] we set up our formalism for simplicial chiral model and derive the large-@xmath0 effective action and a representation for the internal energy .",
    "we begin in section  [ spin ] by illustrating the formalism for the simpler case of vector @xmath22 spin models on a simplicial lattice , deriving the closed form large-@xmath0 solution for arbitrary values of @xmath5 and studying its properties .",
    "sec  [ largenlimit ] gives the large-@xmath0 effective action for the simplicial chiral model and section  [ saddlepoint ] , the saddle - point equation ( large-@xmath0 schwinger - dyson equation ) for the eigenvalue distribution , discussing its features and converting it into a standard inhomogeneous fredholm equation of the second kind .",
    "* in section  [ sec5 ] we analyze the solvable examples .",
    "we begin with integer values of @xmath23 ( which correspond to @xmath24 chiral chains ) , followed in section  [ sec6 ] by a detailed discussion of the @xmath2 case , including features of the weak and strong coupling expansions and the asymptotic expansion around the critical point @xmath25 .",
    "we present in section  [ sec8 ] the exact result for the limit @xmath3 and develop in section  [ sec8a ] a treatment based on the @xmath26 expansion .",
    "this large-@xmath5 analysis , which works best outside the critical region : @xmath27 , has provided us with the first numerical confirmation for the conjecture that @xmath4 , and is discussed in greater details in appendix d. * in section  [ sec7 ] we solve the models at criticality for arbitrary @xmath28 and sketch the peculiar features of the critical behavior when @xmath29 .",

    "this fact is related to the equivalence of the double scaling limit with the continuum limit of a two - dimensional gravity model with central charge @xmath413 .",
    "it has been shown that in the context of single - matrix models the parameter @xmath0 plays a role quite analogous to the volume in ordinary systems , and double scaling limit turns out to be very similar to finite size scaling in a two - dimensional critical phenomenon  @xcite . as a manifestation of this fact , it has been observed that in the gross - witten single - link problem , ( i ) the asymptotic approach of the complex @xmath414 zeroes closest to @xmath37 , @xmath415 , toward the real axis occurs at a rate determined by the correlation length exponent  @xcite , @xmath416 and , ( ii ) for sufficient large @xmath0 the position of the peak of the specific heat , @xmath417 , behaves as  @xcite @xmath418 we recall that in ordinary critical behaviors finite size scaling leads to relations of the type ( [ ae6]-[ae7 ] ) with @xmath0 replaced by the size of the system .",
    "we recall that the chiral chain with @xmath421 is equivalent to the simplicial model with @xmath151 . in this case @xmath152 and the phase transition is still third order . in the weak coupling region , @xmath422 ,",

    "the critical exponent @xmath411 could then be determined by using the 2-d hyperscaling relationship , obtaining @xmath448 .",
    "this value of @xmath411 was confirmed by a numerical monte carlo study of the scaling of the specific heat peak position at finite @xmath0 , we indeed observed a behavior like eq .",

    "strong coupling series of the free energy density of chiral chain models are best generated by means of the character expansion , which leads to the following result @xmath454 where @xmath455 is the free energy of the single unitary matrix model ( @xmath456 and @xmath457 is given by eq .",

    "the calculation of the strong coupling series of @xmath462 is much simplified in the large-@xmath0 limit , due to the following relationships  @xcite @xmath463 and @xmath464 where @xmath465 is independent of @xmath65 and @xmath357 is the order of the representation @xmath466 .",
    "explicit expressions of @xmath460 and @xmath465 are given in ref .",
    "notice that the large-@xmath0 strong coupling expansion of @xmath467 is actually a series in @xmath468 , @xmath469 @xmath470 represents also the generating functional for the `` potentials '' @xmath471 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of the strong coupling expansion of more general models , indeed the following relationship holds @xmath472 it is important to recall that the large-@xmath0 character coefficients have jumps and singularities at @xmath473  @xcite , and therefore the relevant region for a strong - coupling character expansion is @xmath474 .",
    "we have analyzed the strong coupling series of chiral chain models in order to investigate their large-@xmath0 critical behaviors for @xmath475 .",
    "given the simple behavior of the large-@xmath0 limit of @xmath455 , we considered only the contributions from @xmath476 , thus working with series in @xmath468 .",
    "we generated about 15 terms for each @xmath477 and analyzed , as series in @xmath468 , the specific heat derivative , which diverges at the critical point in a third phase transition .",
    "we employed the integral approximant technique  @xcite , which at present seems to be one of the most powerful method of resummation .",
    "in particular we considered integral approximants obtained from first order linear differential equations .",
    "let us begin with the results obtained for the known cases @xmath13 . for @xmath421 already",
    "15 terms in the series ( in @xmath468 ) suffice to get @xmath478 and @xmath479 with a precision of about @xmath480 and @xmath481 respectively .",
    "however it is worth noticing that in the analysis of the specific heat derivative we found spurious non - diverging singularities on the positive real axis for @xmath71 .    concerning the @xmath429 case , it is known that the integral approximant resummation analysis can not reproduce an @xmath218 singularity type  @xcite and therefore it is not really suitable to this case .",
    "anyway , we obtained a good determination of @xmath37 , we found @xmath482 up to about @xmath483 , and a rather stable but wrong exponent , @xmath484 , which should somehow simulate the logarithmic corrections found in the appendix  [ appa ] , given that they can not be generated by the differential equation solution .",
    "again we found spurious non - diverging singularities for @xmath71 .",
    "the strong - coupling analysis starts giving new information when @xmath475 . due to the persistent presence of spurious singularities , guided by the @xmath13 analysis , in all cases we considered the first diverging singularity on the positive real axis as an estimate of the true critical point .",
    "for @xmath485 we obtained quite stable results : @xmath486 and @xmath487 .",
    "we should say that the @xmath429 analysis suggests some caution in accepting this estimate of @xmath410 , it could still be a masked @xmath218 . the analysis of @xmath488 series gave a rather stable estimate of the critical point @xmath489 , but unstable exponents ( although negative and small ) .",
    "similar results were found for @xmath490 : @xmath491 for @xmath492 , @xmath493 for @xmath494 , @xmath495 for @xmath496 . notice that , unlike the @xmath497 cases , these values can not be considered as an estimate of the critical point .",
    "they are indeed larger than @xmath498 , that is out of the region where a strong coupling analysis can be predictive , and therefore something else must happen before , breaking the validity of the strong coupling expansion .",
    "an example of this phenomenon comes from the gross - witten single - link model ( recovered when @xmath398 ) , where the strong coupling expansion of the @xmath401 free energy leads to an analytical function not having singularity at all , @xmath499 , thus @xmath500 can not be determined from a strong coupling analysis .    of course we can not consider this analysis satisfactory , but from it we may hint at a possible scenario .",
    "as for @xmath501 , for @xmath502 , that is when the estimate of @xmath37 coming from the above strong coupling analysis is smaller than @xmath498 and therefore acceptable , the term @xmath476 in eq .",
    "( [ be1 ] ) should be the one relevant for the critical properties , determining the critical points and giving @xmath503 ( maybe @xmath218 as in the @xmath429 case ) . for @xmath490 the critical point may not be a singular point in strong or weak coupling , but just the point where weak coupling and strong coupling curves meet each other . this would cause a softer phase transition with @xmath406 , as for the gross - witten single - link problem .",
    "we expect @xmath504 also for @xmath490",
    ".    this scenario would be consistent with the analysis of green and samuel  @xcite , who studied the behavior of the link determinant ( i.e. @xmath505 ) to determine the critical points .",
    "the values of @xmath37 we found for @xmath502 are consistent with their estimates .",
    "we have briefly discussed in section  [ sec6 ] the possibility of performing weak and strong coupling expansion in the @xmath2 model starting from an expansion in the powers of @xmath506 . here",
    "we want to give more details on the concrete implementation of this program .",
