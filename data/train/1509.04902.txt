    "one way to gain a deeper understanding of turbulence is to break the complex fluid motion down into a few basic building blocks which are connected and often appear repeatedly on different scales . their geometry , dynamics and interaction determines the global statistical properties of the turbulent flow @xcite .",
    "they can be identified either in the lagrangian or eulerian picture .",
    "for example , the most persistent attracting and repelling lagrangian manifolds in a turbulent flow , which are known as lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) @xcite , are found to serve as barriers to the mixing of scalar quantities and thus affect the global scalar fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the stretching of simple burgers - type vortices is used to describe the small - scale intermittency and the related evolution of high - amplitude enstrophy events as well as to explain the non - local energy transfer in the turbulent cascade @xcite . when a passive scalar increment is conditioned to the distance of zero - scalar - gradient points ,",
    "scaling properties similar to scalar structure functions follow @xcite . in all the above examples ,",
    "geometric objects are connected to dynamical processes and statistical properties of the corresponding turbulent flow .    in this work",
    ", we apply these ideas to the formation of thermal plumes in turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) which is present in a fluid layer between two horizontal parallel plates heated from below and cooled from above @xcite .",
    "thermal plumes are fragments of the thin thermal boundary layer .",
    "they are formed in the vicinity of the heated ( cooled ) plate , then rise ( fall ) into the bulk of the turbulent convection layer and provide the major contribution to the near - wall turbulent heat transfer and its local fluctuations .",
    "their dynamics and size have been studied , for example , in experiments @xcite and direct numerical simulations @xcite . here",
    ", we will describe the formation of thermal plumes by the vertical temperature derivatives in connection to the two - dimensional velocity gradient vector field _ directly at the heated ( cooled ) plate_. it is considered as a blueprint of the coupled temperature - velocity dynamics _ above the heated ( cooled ) plate_. the structure of the velocity gradient field at the plate",
    "is determined by its critical or zero points and their local topology .",
    "as we will see , triplets of such critical points play a central role in the near - wall dynamics and can be connected to the formation of line - like thermal plumes .",
    "their dynamics will be analyzed in the eulerian as well as in the lagrangian frames of reference .",
    "we demonstrate that ridges of line - like plumes coincide with attracting hyperbolic lcs of the skin friction field .",
    "the stem of thermal plumes at the hot bottom plate coincides with local minima of the absolute vertical temperature derivative @xmath1 at the plates , where @xmath2 is the vertical direction",
    ". we will therefore derive and discuss a reduced transport equation for this vertical temperature derivative and its magnitude which is based on the fact that at the wall , the velocity gradient tensor @xmath3 has only two non - vanishing components which form a two - dimensional vector field .",
    "we then relate the resulting network of critical points ",
    "saddles and nodes @xcite  to regions on the plate where the thermal plumes are lumped together before their take - off into the bulk . in other words ,",
    "the eigenvalues which determine the phase portrait of the critical points appear in source - sink terms of this reduced transport equation for @xmath4 .",

    "it has been reported that critical points are partly found at the tail of an evolving large - scale structure @xcite . as we will see in the following ,",
    "there are differences from the turbulent shear flow case that has a well - defined unidirectional mean flow . on one hand ,",
    "the differences arise from the different flow geometry . on the other hand",
    ", they also arise from the active coupling of the temperature and velocity fields which is absent in a turbulent channel flow .",

    "furthermore , the two contributions to the first term on the right hand side are of the same order of magnitude and can be summarized to one term .",
    "close to the wall , we can additionally assume that @xmath80 . together with the @xmath81 expansions , this simplifies ( [ gz1 ] ) to @xmath82 multiplying the equation with @xmath70 results in the following balance equation for the vertical temperature gradient magnitude @xmath83 the total time derivative on the left hand side of ( [ gz3 ] ) summarizes the partial time derivative and the advection which is dominantly by the horizontal velocity components .",
    "if we align the coordinate axes in the vicinity of the critical points with the two eigenvectors , i.e. , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , eq . ( [ gz3 ] ) can be further simplified to @xmath86 the first term on the right hand side of ( [ gz5 ] ) is a gain term when unstable nodes or foci are locally present . in turn , the magnitude of @xmath70 decreases when stable nodes or foci exist .",
    "this simplified balance equation illustrates clearly the close connection between the local topology of the skin friction field which is given by the eigenvalues @xmath87 and @xmath88 and the vertical temperature derivative and thus the plumes .    as a short note ,",
    "we briefly discuss the case of free - slip boundary conditions at the heating and cooling plates which are given by @xmath89 in this case the skin friction field vanishes , @xmath90 , and yet the plumes are generated . in such a scenario ,",

    "the two - dimensional slip velocity on the wall plays the role of skin friction field in characterizing the plume dynamics . in this paper , we only present and analyse data considering no - slip boundary conditions . for a quantitative analysis",

    "we highlight a saddle and an unstable node , the latter of which are sources of the skin friction field , at both plates .",
    "unstable nodes are generated by cold downward flows which hit the bottom plate or hot upward flows which hit the top plate .",
    "they are surrounded by regions of high shear as indicated by the magnitude of @xmath35 .",
    "the field lines of the skin friction field point almost perfectly radially away from the node , a source region of the skin friction field .    in the mid panels we display the contours of @xmath4 at @xmath23 ( top row ) and @xmath99 at @xmath97 ( bottom row ) .",
    "contours of @xmath4 equal contours of the temperature @xmath100 slightly above the plate .",
    "this was verified , but is not displayed here .",
    "the regions with the largest vertical temperature derivative , i.e. , with the smallest magnitude , are considered as the regions in which line - like plume ridges form and detach subsequently .",
    "they coincide with the regions where the magnitude of the skin friction field  and thus the tangential stresses or the local shear  are small .",
    "high - shear regions fall in between regions in which cold plumes hit the bottom plate or hot plumes are about to detach .",
    "the comparison of the skin friction fields at the bottom and top plates shows also that both fields are not synchronized by hot line - like plumes rising from the bottom straight to the top and cold line - like plumes falling from the top down to the bottom of the cell .",
    "plumes will be dispersed by the turbulence in the bulk of the cell when they rise and fall .",
    "the impact of colder fluid at the bottom and hotter fluid at the top , i.e. , the process which generates unstable nodes of the skin friction field , is thus most probably a consequence of the incompressibility .",
    "the rise of plume ridges into the bulk pushes neighboring fluid back towards the bottom plate .",
    "it can be expected that this behavior depends also on the prandtl number of the working fluid .    the lower right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the divergence of the skin friction field .",

    "we verified that the exclusion of side wall boundary data does not change the results .",
    "the distributions display the typical exponential tails which reflect the intermittent statistics of velocity derivatives .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mean values of the distribution differ ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) indicating a large scale circulation ( lsc ) which breaks azimuthal symmetry .",
    "this is readily confirmed from the streamlines of the time - averaged skin friction field shown for @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ fig4b ] , that are mostly aligned in the negative @xmath28-direction .",

    "it is known from other dns studies @xcite that lsc exhibits a very slow angular drift ( at time scales larger than 1000 free - fall units @xmath110 ) , which explains the biased directionality of the lsc in our case due to the fact that the time window for averaging was smaller . in addition , the lsc depends on @xmath111 and becomes less coherent at large @xmath111 . the rayleigh number of @xmath112 in our case being relatively small",

    "the whole positive tail of the conditioned pdf exceeds that of the unconditioned pdf .",
    "this finding statistically underlines the observation , which was discussed earlier : positive divergence of the skin friction field is connected with unstable nodes which hit the bottom plate and generate high magnitude temperature derivatives .",
    "the critical points of the two - dimensional skin friction field are usually not located on the grid points where all the discretized field variables are approximated . due to this reason",

    "it can be observed that the number of critical points is strongly fluctuating .",
    "furthermore , we detect that the number of nodes and saddles is not the same ( see bottom panel of fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this is a significant difference from the numerical studies in the channel flow .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "first , the euler characteristic is not zero for our circular disk with boundary as we have discussed in sec .",
    "iii b. secondly , due to the no - slip boundary conditions , the skin - friction field vanishes on the boundary , i.e. , @xmath120 , so that the poincar - hopf theorem for manifolds with boundaries is not applicable .",
    "thirdly , for the same reason even the critical points in the interior of the disk are often found very close to sidewalls .",
    "we note that an extension of the poincar - hopf theorem @xcite holds also for the case of isolated critical points on the boundary of @xmath22 .",
    "thus the search algorithm for the critical points excludes a very tiny region at the boundary of the circular bottom and top plate , in order to restrict to saddles and nodes away from the sidewall .",
    "only these critical points are in the focus of this analysis and remain an important structural element of the skin friction field of thermal convection compared to channel flows .    .",
    "a snapshots of the skin friction field is shown .",
    "the solid lines between the nodes are thought as a guide to the eye .",

    "the data are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig7].,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    figure  [ fig7 ] underlines that the plume ridges can be associated in most instances with node - saddle - node triplets .",
    "these triplets can be found isolated as in fig .",

    "is a saddle point of @xmath35 which is formed in a stagnation point flow configuration .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in other snapshots which we have analyzed in detail .",
    "it is needless to say that exactly the same dynamics is present at the top plate for the formation of cold plumes that fall into the bulk of the cell .    how can the regions around unstable nodes be separated from each other ?",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] displays field lines of the surface vorticity , @xmath129 , for which @xmath130 holds . by comparing this figure and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , one can see that the unstable nodes of the skin friction field are surrounded by closed field lines of surface vorticity .",
    "the outermost closed field lines of the surface vorticity coincide with the local regions of enhanced shear which form between the regions where the cold ( hot ) plumes hit the bottom ( top ) plate and where new plume ridges are formed .",
    "this outermost closed field line is in some cases detected as a limiting streamline to which closed field lines of the surface vorticity converge from the in- and outside .",
    "this is observed for the upper left node in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and is connected with field lines of the skin friction field that remain not perfectly radial further away from the critical point .",

    "we integrate lagrangian trajectories initialized on a fine grid by a fourth - order runge - kutta method and interpolate linearly with respect to time between the snapshots and by means of cubic splines with respect to the space .",
    "approximations of the ftles are obtained by computing the maximum relative dispersion between neighboring trajectories , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the lcs are then extracted from the local maxima of the resulting scalar field .",
    "figure 9 displays the result for three time instants @xmath136 . here",
    "attracting lcs are obtained by a backward - in - time integration starting at @xmath137 .",
    "they are highlighted as the black solid lines in the top row contour plots of @xmath4 .",
    "for comparison , we replot in the bottom row of the same figure the streamlines of the skin friction field together with the node - saddle - node triplets .",
    "the result confirms that the attracting lcs which are largely determined by the unstable manifolds of the saddles in the time - frozen fields are found at the line - like plume ridges .",
    "we discussed the connection between the moving skeleton of critical points of the skin friction field and the vertical temperature derivative _ at the heated plate _ as a blueprint of the near - wall dynamics of line - like plume formation _ right above the heated plate_. node - saddle - node triplets are identified as the typical configurations which form line - like plumes .",
    "nodes are found where cold fluid hits the bottom plate .",
    "this is in contrast to former results in plane shear flows in which saddles and nodes form almost exclusively pairs rather than triplets . beside the different geometry of the plates ,",
    "there are several further differences between a boundary layer in a convection cell and a plane channel . for the rbc case ,",

    "@xcite , the mean flow in a convection cell is fully three - dimensional and obeys its own complex slow dynamics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "fluid turbulence is generated by buoyancy forces in the present case .",
    "line - like thermal plumes , which form a skeleton that moves across the plate , are a typical feature that does not exist in a shear flow .",
    "the plume ridges enclose regions in which cold fluid is pushed back towards the bottom plate and generates unstable nodes of the skin friction field .",
    "ring - like regions of high shear form around these unstable nodes .",
    "they can be identified by closed field lines of the surface vorticity .",
    "we have also discussed that our observation does not violate the poincar  hopf theorem since @xmath57 for the present case . finally , the application of lagrangian coherent structure analysis showed that our ideas hold in a dynamical framework .",
    "the unstable manifolds of the saddles points visually coincide with attracting hyperbolic lagrangian coherent structures .",
    "attracting hyperbolic lcs are also found where the plume ridges are formed which subsequently rise into the bulk .",
    "with a view to the future work several points are interesting .",
    "first , the local flow reversals which should be found in the vicinity of foci are rare as fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows .",
    "this is similar to the channel flow analysis .",
    "very recently , they have also been found experimentally @xcite in a shear flow and are thought to play a central role for the formation of large - scale structures .",
    "their role in rbc is yet open since the large - scale flow is not uni - directional and depends on time .",
    "the percentage and dynamical relevance of foci could increase as the rayleigh number grows .",
    "second , we studied here one data set in order to demonstrate the ideas and concepts .",
    "it is certainly interesting and necessary to verify how robust the picture is for higher rayleigh numbers .",
    "furthermore , what happens when the prandtl numbers are much larger or smaller than one and both boundary layers get decoupled ?",
    "it can be expected that the dynamics is very different for the high - prandtl case in comparison to the low - prandtl case ( at same @xmath111 ) simply due to the fact that the coherent large - scale motion is significantly weaker in the former case .",
    "some of these analyses have been started very recently and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "third , we saw that the skin friction fields at the top and bottom plates are not directly synchronized .",
    "the reason is that thermal plumes can not rise straight to the top plate for the present prandtl numbers .",
    "however , a large - scale circulation exists in a closed cell . for the present aspect ratio",
    ", a single large roll is expected @xcite which couples the dynamics at the top and bottom plates .",
    "the particular way of coupling requires further detailed analysis .        finally ,",
    "as especially the regions around unstable nodes are key to the plume formation , a direct and robust approximation is needed for further investigation .",
    "set - oriented numerical methods using stochastic matrices are tailored for finding dynamically distinct regions in complex flows @xcite . a preliminary study along this line is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the resulting partition of the bottom plate compares well with the corresponding lcs which is shown for the same data set in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) .",
    "the application of such transfer - operator based approaches to the computational analysis of plume formation in the full three - dimensional rayleigh - bnard system is a subject for future research . in order to quantify for example the transport of heat and momentum which is associated with the sets that are shown in fig .
