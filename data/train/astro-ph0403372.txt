    "( 2003 ) and de blok & walter ( 2003 ) have reported the detection of young stars in the outer hi disk of the nearest dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822 ( @xmath1 kpc ) at galactocentric radii well beyond @xmath2 .",
    "these authors discuss the results in terms of the commonly - accepted picture , where young massive stars form out of the observed hi in response to some `` triggering '' mechanism such as the passage of a companion galaxy ( in this case a massive intergalactic hi cloud )",
    ". however , an `` interaction '' scenario is problematic for ngc 6822 , since as de blok & walter point out there is little evidence for tidal `` impact trauma '' on the distribution of old stars in the galaxy .",
    "cuillandre et .",
    "al .  ( 2001 ) discovered a whole population of upper - main - sequence ( mostly b ) stars in a large field ( @xmath3 ) in the outer parts of m31 ( @xmath4 kpc at @xmath5 kpc ) beyond @xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "reddening of the accompanying ( and much more numerous ) red giant stars implied the presence of dust .",
    "both the young stars and the reddening correlated well in position with the brightness of the hi on a scale of @xmath7 kpc .",
    "the dust / hi ratio is @xmath8 of the galactic value near the sun .",
    "the hi distribution appears quiescent , showing the general rotation of the galaxy .",
    "if the current view that star formation occurs in molecular clouds is correct , then the presence of dust and young stars in the outer parts of galaxies implies that molecular gas must also be present in these regions . in that case",
    "an `` inverse '' explanation for the close association of hi and young stars is suggested , namely , that * _ the young stars have themselves produced the hi by photodissociation of their parent molecular clouds_. * the dissociated hi re - forms to h@xmath9 on dust grains , and the observed hi column density is a result of a dissociation @xmath0 reformation equilibrium . in this case",
    "the hi column density can be computed from ( cf .",
    "allen et al . ( 2003 ) and references given there ) : @xmath10 }   { \\rm ~cm}^{-2}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the fuv flux and dust / gas ratio w.r.t .  the galaxy near the sun .",
    "for instance , @xmath14 on the surface of a low - density ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) low - metallicity ( @xmath17 ) molecular cloud can be maintained by a fuv flux of @xmath18 , the equivalent of @xmath19 one b3v star every @xmath20 pc in the disk .",
    "the re - formation time on the surfaces of dust grains in such a medium seems long , @xmath21 yrs , but in fact this is short ( @xmath22 ) compared to the rotation time , which is the relevant time scale here in the absence of galactic collisions .",
    "an equilibrium is therefore likely even under these extreme conditions of low molecular gas density and low fuv flux .",
    "the accompanying molecular clouds will be cold and of low density , rendering the normal molecular tracers ( e.g. co(1 - 0 ) ) undetectable .",
    "more precise calculations are being carried out for m31 where the data of cuillandre et.al .",
    "provides a complete census of all upper - main - sequence stars ( diaz - miller , allen , & cuillandre , in preparation ) .",
    "initial results indicate that most , and perhaps all , of the hi in the outer parts of disk galaxies can be accounted for in this way .",
    "* _ * the hypothesis : * an @xmath23 photodissociation @xmath0 reformation equilibrium scenario provides a simple explanation for the coexistence of young stars , dust , and hi in the outer parts of disk galaxies .",
    "_ * _ * the hypothesis is falsifiable : * if we find dynamically quiescent hi regions in the outer parts of galaxies without dissociating stars ( @xmath24 , b5 or brighter , @xmath25 ) then this idea is wrong .",
    "_ * _ * a prediction : * even low surface brightness galaxies such as ngc 2915 will have dissociating b - stars mixed in with their hi . _"
