    "there are various two - dimensional ( 2d ) physical systems that allow direct observation of individual particle dynamics .",
    "these systems include colloidal suspensions  @xcite , granular materials  @xcite , electrons on a liquid helium surface in a wigner lattice  @xcite , ions confined magnetically in a penning trap  @xcite , and single - layer dusty plasmas  @xcite . in these systems , the relevant particles collide with their neighbors frequently , so that momentum and energy are transported from one place to another .",
    "( in all these 2d physical systems , motion is not purely 2d , but usually includes some limited out - of - plane motion , so that the systems are often described as quasi-2d . )",
    "shear viscosity , @xmath0 , is a transport coefficient that characterizes the momentum flux perpendicular to a velocity gradient .",
    "sustaining the velocity gradient requires the application of a shear stress , which corresponds to an off - diagonal element of a stress tensor .",
    "the hydrodynamical definition of shear viscosity is the ratio of this off - diagonal element and the velocity gradient  @xcite . as a measure of dissipation ,",
    "viscosity is useful , for example , in describing the damping of shear waves  @xcite .",
    "the green - kubo relation for viscosity , as described in sec .",
    "ii , allows a calculation of viscosity using as its input a time series record of the motion of individual particles  @xcite .",
    "the relation is based on fluctuations , not a macroscopic velocity gradient .",
    "the green - kubo relation has been widely used in molecular dynamics ( md ) _ simulations _ , for example  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a need for a test of the green - kubo relation for viscosity using an input of experimental data . in our search of the literature",
    "we have not found any such test , nor have we found any previous use of the green - kubo relation with an input of experimental data to determine viscosity .    viscosity is most commonly determined in experiments using a macroscopic velocity gradient .",
    "for example , in a rheometer  @xcite , a stress is applied by a moving boundary , causing the liquid to flow with a velocity gradient , so that the viscosity can be determined using its hydrodynamical definition .",
    "another experimental approach , which is used with experimental data from colloidal suspensions and other soft materials without macroscopic velocity gradients , is the measurement of the mean - square displacement ( msd ) of individual particles and the assumption that the stokes - einstein relation is valid , allowing a calculation of the viscosity from the measured msd  @xcite , as discussed in sec .",
    "all of these experimental methods are different from the use of the green - kubo relation .",
    "it has been questioned whether transport coefficients exist in 2d systems .",
    "molecular dynamical simulations suggested that the diffusion , viscosity , and thermal conductivity coefficients would not exist in a 2d system of _ hard disks _  @xcite .",
    "this result led to theoretical investigations that indicated the time integral in the green - kubo relations diverges and the corresponding transport coefficients in 2d systems are non - existing  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this issue of convergence in sec .",
    "iv  e.    in this paper , we test the green - kubo relation with an input of experimental data from a quasi-2d dusty plasma .",
    "the dust particles in a dusty plasma , unlike hard disks , have a relatively long - range interparticle interaction .    our results and conclusions in this paper",
    "are intended to have a usefulness that extends beyond the area of dusty plasmas .",
    "accordingly , we have attempted to make our presentation accessible to scientists who are not specialists in that area .",
    "the experimental data used in this paper are from an experiment by feng _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we will introduce the concepts of dusty plasmas , along with some key aspects of the experiment , below as well as in sec .",
    "further details of the experiment can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a dusty plasma is a _ four - component _ mixture consisting of micron - size particles of solid matter , a gas of neutral atoms , free electrons , and free positive ions .",
    "we will refer in this paper to the particles of solid matter as `` dust particles . '' in experiments , the gas is often argon , and so are the ions .",
    "the electrons and positive ions are present because of electric fields , provided by a power supply , which lead to a weak ionization of the neutral argon gas . because of the much larger mobility of the electrons , as compared to the ions ,",
    "many more electrons are collected on the dust particles , so that a dust particle develops a large negative electric charge , comparable to thousands of elementary charges  @xcite .",
    "the electrons and ions that surround a negatively - charged dust particle are disturbed , resulting in a screening layer with a surplus of positive ions that surrounds the dust particle . because of the complicated interactions amongst its four components , a dusty plasma is sometimes termed a `` complex plasma '' @xcite . while the gas , electrons and ions fill a 3d vacuum chamber , the dust particles do not .",
    "they are levitated against the downward force of gravity by a strong vertical electric field . in the experiment",
    "@xcite , enough dust particles were introduced to fill a single horizontal layer , but not enough to begin filling a second layer .",
    "the dust particles were not in contact with any solid boundary , but they suffer a friction due to the surrounding neutral argon gas . in this paper , we will always consider the gas atoms as a whole to be a continuum , but we will consider the dust particles as individual entities .",
    "the experiment  @xcite can be described as quasi-2d .",
    "the dust particles , although they are three dimensional , are arranged in two dimensions .",
    "it was verified , using video observations , that the dust particle motion in the vertical direction was extremely limited , as compared to that in the horizontal direction , so that dust particles moved past one another only as a result of their horizontal motion .",
    "the neutral argon gas is rarefied in the experiment  @xcite . at a density",
    "five orders of magnitude less than in a standard atmosphere , collisions amongst gas atoms have a long mean free path , on the order of 1 cm .",
    "the effect of those collisions is diminished even more because the dust particles occupy only a thin 2d layer , so that a gas atom that collides with a dust particle is likely to be knocked out of the layer of the dust particles  @xcite .",
    "thus , no significant transfer of momentum between two dust particles can occur due to the first one colliding with a gas atom which then collides with the second one .",
    "the only interaction between dust particles and gas that we must consider is the frictional drag force @xmath1 on the dust particle , which is proportional to the relative velocity between the dust particle and the gas as a whole . in  @xcite the gas flow",
    "was negligibly slow .",
    "since it is only the motion of the dust particles that will be of interest here , we will simplify our description of the four - component mixture .",
    "the dust particles are assumed to interact amongst themselves with a screened coulomb repulsion , as discussed in sec .",
    "the role of the electrons and ions is then only to modify the interparticle potential and provide the screening .",
    "thus , in our simplified description of the four - component mixture we consider only a _ binary mixture _ : first , moving charged dust particles whose interaction potential is a screened coulomb repulsion , and second a stationary neutral gas that exerts a frictional drag on moving dust particles .",
    "this reduction of a four - component mixture to a binary mixture , in which all the properties of the electrons and ions are contained in the screening , has been used previously in theoretical descriptions of dusty plasmas , for example in the analysis of wave propagation  @xcite . when using this binary - mixture description , one could consider a charged dust particle as a `` dressed particle ''  @xcite consisting of a micron - size solid core that is negatively charged and a larger surrounding screening region that is positively charged .",
    "the center of this dressed particle corresponds to what is observed experimentally by video microscopy .    in the experiment",
    "@xcite , the repulsion between dust particles was so strong that the dust particles self - organized in a solid - like arrangement called a wigner crystal  @xcite . in order to study a liquid and its viscosity ,",
    "this solid was melted by increasing the kinetic energy of the dust particles , which was done by using the laser - heating method  @xcite .",
    "when we refer in this paper to viscosity , it is only the motion of the dust particles that we directly take into account . in our simplified description of a dusty plasma , treating it as a binary mixture of dust particles and gas , we do not consider the momentum carried by electrons and ions .",
    "moreover , a transfer of momentum between two dust particles does not occur due to the first dust particle colliding with a gas atom which then collides with the second , as discussed above .",
    "thus , in our simplified binary - mixture description , the viscosity describes motion of only dust particles  @xcite .",
    "previously , viscosity was studied in other dusty plasma experiments by applying a macroscopic shear stress using laser manipulation  @xcite to generate a macroscopic velocity gradient , and using a hydrodynamical approach to calculate the viscosity based on the measured velocity profile of the dust particles . in the test",
    "reported in this paper , we will compare the hydrodynamical result of  @xcite to the viscosity determined using a theoretical green - kubo relation with an input of data from the experiment of  @xcite , which was performed without a macroscopic velocity gradient .    in section  ii , the green - kubo relation for viscosity is reviewed . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide further details of the experiment  @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv , we introduce how we use the green - kubo relation with an input of experimental data . in sec .",
    "v , we report our md simulations of the experiment  @xcite .",
    "we determine the viscosity in sec .",
    "vi , and in sec .",
    "vii this result using the green - kubo relation is compared to the results of a previous experiment using a hydrodynamical method  @xcite . in sec .",
    "vii we also provide a comparison to the results of previous computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "to obtain transport coefficients such as diffusion , viscosity , and thermal conductivity in a liquid , green - kubo relations  @xcite are often used .",
    "their required inputs include time series for the positions and velocities of particles .",
    "the simplest of these green - kubo relations is the one for diffusion .",
    "it can be derived easily using the physical assumption that the msd for fluctuating particle displacements is proportional to the diffusion coefficient and the time  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the green - kubo relation for viscosity is less trivial , and it is based on the fluctuating stress , not an msd  @xcite . here",
    "we review the standard green - kubo relation for calculating viscosity , in three steps , as it is used for all kinds of liquids , not just dusty plasmas in a liquid phase .    in the first step , an off - diagonal element of the stress tensor @xmath2",
    "is defined by @xmath3,}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote different particles , @xmath6 is the total number of particles of mass @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the position of particle @xmath4 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the interparticle potential energy .",
    "although not indicated in eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) , the positions and velocities of particles vary with time , and this accounts for the time dependence of @xmath2 . in the second step ,",
    "an autocorrelation function of @xmath13 is calculated as @xmath14 we will refer to @xmath15 as the stress autocorrelation function ( sacf ) .",
    "the brackets @xmath16 denote an average over an equilibrium ensemble , which in practice is often replaced by an average over different initial conditions . in the third step ,",
    "the sacf is integrated over time to yield the viscosity @xmath0 ; for a 2d system the result is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the area of the 2d system and @xmath19 is its temperature . equation ( [ eta ] ) combined with eq .",
    "( [ sacf ] ) represent the green - kubo relation for viscosity in 2d .",
    "similar green - kubo relations can be written for diffusion and thermal conductivity  @xcite .",
    "viscosity @xmath0 and mass density @xmath20 have different dimensions in 2d and 3d .",
    "the units of @xmath0 are @xmath21 in 2d , and @xmath22 in 3d .",
    "correspondingly , in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) we have replaced the usual volume for a 3d system with an area @xmath18 for the 2d system . in 2d , the areal mass density is @xmath23 with units of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the areal number density .",
    "we will report results for the kinematic viscosity @xmath26 , which has the same units in 2d and 3d .    while green - kubo relations have been commonly used in computer simulations ,",
    "their use with experimental data is uncommon .",
    "we are aware of only one previous calculation of any transport coefficient using the input of experimental data in a green - kubo relation . using data from a dusty plasma experiment , vaulina _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the _ diffusion _ coefficient using its green - kubo relation , which is a time integration of the velocity autocorrelation function . calculating this autocorrelation function required an input of dust particle velocities , which were determined from experimental measurements of dust particle positions . in principle , the approach of vaulina _",
    "of using a green - kubo relation to obtain the diffusion coefficient could be extended to other transport coefficients : the viscosity , thermal conductivity , and bulk viscosity .    in this paper",
    ", we use the the green - kubo relation for _ viscosity _ with an input of experimental data . a comparison of our result for viscosity with values determined in a previous experiment using a hydrodynamic method with a velocity gradient  @xcite will serve as an experimental test of the green - kubo relation for viscosity .    besides the green - kubo relation ,",
    "microrheology is another method to obtain the viscosity of fluids without a macroscopic velocity gradient  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the msd of individual microparticles is measured , and the stokes - einstein relation is assumed to be valid  @xcite .",
    "the stokes - einstein relation  @xcite is a combination of the stokes law , which is a hydrodynamic model for viscous flow at a low reynolds number , and the einstein relation , which relates a diffusion coefficient for brownian motion and a frictional force .",
    "this msd - based method has been used in physical systems like colloidal suspensions , where a microparticles s motion is overdamped due to the surrounding liquid solvent  @xcite .",
    "the green - kubo relation for viscosity is different from msd - based approaches of determining viscosity .",
    "the derivation of the green - kubo relation centers on the fluctuations of the stress @xmath27 , and it does not rely on the validity of a diffusion coefficient . the stokes - einstein relation , while having great utility for many physical systems , is known to fail for others such as supercooled liquids  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible that a physical system can have a valid viscosity coefficient but lack a valid diffusion coefficient , for example due to superdiffusion , as has been suggested for 2d systems , such as yukawa liquids  @xcite .",
    "before reviewing the experiment  @xcite we will discuss a few properties of dusty plasmas and their relevant length and time scales .    when dust particles have a charge of several thousand elementary charges , their interparticle potential energy @xmath28 can be larger than their kinetic energy . in this case",
    ", the collection of dust particles is said to be a `` strongly - coupled plasma ''  @xcite .",
    "a measure of strong coupling is the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the charge of the dust particle , @xmath31 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath32 is a typical interparticle distance as defined below , and @xmath19 is the kinetic temperature of the dust particles .",
    "the coulomb coupling parameter is essentially a ratio of interparticle potential energy and kinetic energy .",
    "a plasma is strongly coupled when @xmath33 , and it can behave like a liquid or a wigner crystal . in a dusty plasma ,",
    "the dust particles are usually strongly coupled due to their large charge @xmath30 .",
    "the electrons and the ions have a much smaller charge , and in most plasmas they are not strongly coupled , unless great efforts are made to cool them to low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the _ length scales _ of a dusty plasma include the screening length @xmath34 and the typical distance between dust particles . in the dusty plasma literature , the typical distance between dust particles is commonly reported either as the lattice constant @xmath35 for a wigner crystal , or as @xmath36 for a liquid , where @xmath25 is the areal number density . in the literature for strongly - coupled plasmas , @xmath32 is called the 2d wigner - seitz radius  @xcite .",
    "all three of these length scales , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath32 , are typically on the order of 1  mm .",
    "the diameter of a dust particle is typically a few microns , which is much smaller than any of these length scales , and also much smaller than the mean free path for collisions amongst the rarefied argon gas atoms .",
    "the _ time scales _ of a dusty plasma include measures of collective motion amongst the dust particles , and of the frictional drag experienced by a dust particle due to the gas as a whole .",
    "the former is quantified by the 2d plasma frequency for dust particles , @xmath37  @xcite , where the subscripts @xmath38 and @xmath39 refer to plasma and dust , respectively .",
    "the frictional drag experienced by a dust particle due to the neutral argon gas is quantified by a friction coefficient , which is commonly defined in the literature for dusty plasmas as @xmath40 , where @xmath1 is the gas friction force experienced by one dust particle and @xmath41 is the momentum of the same particle .",
    "this coefficient has the dimension of inverse time , and a typical value for a micron - size dust particle in a rarefied gas is @xmath42 . if the gas is sufficiently rarefied , @xmath43 , so that the dust particle motion is said to be underdamped .",
    "we now summarize some aspects of the experiment  @xcite that are relevant for our analysis .",
    "the dust particles were polymer microspheres of @xmath44 diameter .",
    "they were levitated by a vertical dc electric field to form a single horizontal layer , as sketched in fig .  1",
    ". radial dc electric fields provided horizontal confinement so that the dust particles filled a circular region of diameter 52  mm .    for each experimental run ,",
    "one movie of dust particle motion was recorded . a phantom v5.2 high - speed camera viewed the dust particles from above .",
    "it was operated at 250 frames / s , so that data were recorded with a time interval @xmath45 .",
    "the duration of a movie , @xmath46 , was limited by the camera s memory .",
    "the camera s field - of - view ( fov ) included @xmath47 dust particles .",
    "two of the required inputs for eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) , the positions and velocities of the dust particles , were obtained using the moment method  @xcite and particle tracking  @xcite .",
    "the interparticle distance , averaged over the camera s fov , was characterized by @xmath48 in the wigner crystal , and @xmath49 in the liquid .",
    "a total of seven runs were performed .",
    "three runs without laser heating were made to determine the interparticle potential energy in the wigner crystal .",
    "four runs were done with laser heating to make the liquid , and they provide the data that we will use here as the input for the green - kubo relation , to determine viscosity in the liquid phase .",
    "the laser heating method  @xcite uses the radiation - pressure due to laser beams , which are directed toward the dust particles by scanning mirrors  @xcite , which we configured as in  @xcite .",
    "laser heating increases the kinetic temperature of dust particles without changing their charge .",
    "the velocity distribution function has been observed to be nearly maxwellian  @xcite . in the experiment",
    "@xcite , the kinetic temperature @xmath19 , calculated from the mean - square velocity  @xcite , was @xmath50 in the liquid ( with laser heating ) , and @xmath51 in the wigner crystal ( without laser heating ) .",
    "the temperature was nearly uniform spatially , which is desirable because viscosity varies with temperature .",
    "calculations of viscosity with the green - kubo relation eqs .",
    "( [ ss])-([eta ] ) must be adapted to use the experimental data as input , due to four difficulties .",
    "first , the experiment  @xcite provided direct measurements of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , but not of the interparticle potential energy @xmath12 .",
    "second , the camera has a finite fov , so that we do not have data for all dust particles in the 2d layer .",
    "third , the motion of dust particles may include a local macroscopic flow , i.e. , a non - zero time - average velocity .",
    "fourth , the data for the positions and velocities of the dust particles are recorded as a time series of a finite duration , so that the integral in eq .  ( [ eta ] ) must have a finite limit .",
    "we will take all this into account by making a number of approximations in the green - kubo calculations .",
    "we will next describe these approximations as well as discuss the validity of the results that are obtained .      to solve the first difficulty , a lack of experimental measurements of the interparticle potential energy @xmath12",
    ", we will use a model for these energies when calculating the off - diagonal element of the stress tensor @xmath27 . for",
    "a single - layer dusty plasma like ours , models that have been tested successfully include an isotropic repulsion according to the 3d debye - hckel potential  @xcite @xmath56 as well as more complicated isotropic  @xcite and non - isotropic interactions  @xcite .",
    "here we will use the debye - hckel potential , eq .",

    "two parameters in eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) , @xmath30 and @xmath34 , were determined in the experiment  @xcite using a phonon - spectra method  @xcite in the wigner crystal .",
    "for the three experimental runs without laser heating , position and velocity measurements were used to compute the phonon spectra , which were compared to theoretical wave dispersion relations  @xcite that assume eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) , yielding @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the elementary charge . using these two values along with measured particle positions and velocities , we can calculate @xmath27 and then the sacf  @xcite .",

    "we find that the coulomb coupling parameter is @xmath62 for the liquid of dust particles .",
    "the dimensionless particle spacing  @xcite is @xmath63 .",
    "we also calculated @xmath64 .",
    "we note that @xmath65 is significantly larger than the gas friction coefficient @xmath66 , indicating that dust particle motion is underdamped .      to solve our second difficulty , the finite field of view ( fov ) of the camera that limits us to recording data for only a portion of the dust particles , we will _ cut off _ the interparticle potential in eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) at large distances .",

    "both @xmath6 and @xmath75 fluctuate slightly with time , as dust particles move across the edges of the regions , but not enough to affect the result for viscosity significantly .",
    "our third difficulty to solve is that the average velocity is not zero , due to finite macroscopic flow velocities of the dust particles , despite efforts that were made in the experiment  @xcite to avoid them .",
    "when computing the stress , the dust particle velocities are assumed to fluctuate about an average value of zero .",
    "in fact , a non - zero average velocity would contribute an unwanted constant value to the @xmath27 time series , when computed using eq .",

    "we will mention three questions .",
    "first , we note that the green - kubo relations are strictly speaking for the thermodynamic limit , where the number of dust particles and the system size tend to infinity while keeping the number density constant .",
    "in fact , the experiment has only thousands of dust particles .",
    "however , we believe that our experimental system size is large enough to use a green - kubo relation , as indicated by our system - size tests in sec .  v.    second , we must consider the distinction between equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems . while our laser - heated dusty plasma is in a steady state",
    ", it is not in equilibrium .",
    "the collection of dust particles is best described as a driven - dissipative system  @xcite , where the driving is mainly provided by the laser beams , and the dissipation is provided by gas - dust collisions as well as the dust - particle viscosity . despite these nonequilibrium conditions , however , the velocity distribution function for the dust particles has been observed to be nearly maxwellian  @xcite .",
    "thus , the statistics are close to those of an equilibrium system , which motivates us to use the green - kubo relation .",
    "third , we must ask whether long - time tails in the correlation function prevent the convergence of its integral , as was predicted theoretically  @xcite for 2d systems with hard - disk interparticle interactions .",
    "more recently , for a 2d system with a debye - hckel potential , simulations by donk _",

    "@xcite indicated that long - time tails occur in some but not all cases .",
    "in particular , they reported that the sacf decays fast enough that its time integral @xmath0 converges for a liquid at temperatures near the melting point , but not at absolute temperatures far above the melting point .",
    "to assess three sources of error mentioned in sec .",
    "iv , _ viz . _ the potential cutoff , the fov division , and the finite system size , we used md simulations based on the langevin equation  @xcite . in these simulations",

    "we found that for a cutoff of @xmath93 , which we use in this paper , the viscosity result @xmath0 was reduced by less than @xmath94 , as compared to the result for a much larger cutoff of @xmath95 .    to test for errors arising from the division of the fov , we compared results with and without the division , using eq .",

    "for the smaller size , to mimic the experiment  @xcite , we used 48 simulation runs with @xmath97 particles , as in the inner region for the experiment  @xcite , for a duration  @xcite of @xmath98 . comparing these two results for @xmath0 , we find no statistically - significant system - size effects .",
    "this test , shown in table  i , gives us confidence that the number of dust particles in  @xcite was not so small as to preclude using the green - kubo relation .",
    "we now present our result for the viscosity @xmath0 using the green - kubo relation , eqs .",
    "( [ ssexp])-([etaexp ] ) .",
    "we report the kinematic viscosity , @xmath26 , to allow convenient comparison to other experiments and simulations .",
    "we find @xmath99 , in units of @xmath100 .",
    "the value of the normalization factor for the experiment  @xcite is @xmath101 , while the areal mass density is @xmath102 .",
    "the value of @xmath103 is the mean of the four experimental runs in the presence of laser heating , as plotted in fig .",
    "the error estimate of @xmath104 , calculated as the standard deviation of the mean , indicates the run - to - run random variation .",
    "our most significant result is a test of the green - kubo relation for viscosity , using an input of experimental data .",
    "we perform this test by comparing our result @xmath105 to the previously - reported result , from a dusty plasma experiment  @xcite that used a hydrodynamical approach .    in the experiment of nosenko and goree  @xcite ,",
    "the dust particles flowed in their quasi-2d layer with a macroscopic velocity gradient , allowing a determination of viscosity using a navier stokes equation of motion for the local flow velocity of the dust particles . differently from  @xcite , in our analysis here",
    "we consider the dust particles only as individual particles , while in  @xcite data for individual particles were averaged to allow considering the dust particles as a continuum , as is necessary for a hydrodynamical approach .",
    "both experiments ,  @xcite and @xcite , were performed in the same chamber , and both had a quasi-2d layer of dust particles .",
    "the reported values of @xmath89 were nearly the same , @xmath106 for  @xcite and 0.5 for  @xcite .",
    "the electrical interactions among dust particles was much stronger than gas friction , @xmath107 , in both experiments .",
    "a difference in the experimental conditions was that the two laser beams were manipulated differently so that in  @xcite they produced a macroscopic velocity gradient , while in  @xcite there was heating without a macroscopic velocity gradient .",
    "considering the complexity of the dusty plasma and our simplifications in describing it , we can not expect our result to agree with the results of  @xcite better than within about a factor of two .",
    "in fact , we find agreement within this factor when comparing our result @xmath105 using the green - kubo relation and the range of values reported by nosenko and goree  @xcite , fig .  4 .",
    "we also compare our result from the green - kubo relation to the available data for viscosity from the simulation literature , fig .",
    "all these data are from 2d md simulations with a debye - hckel potential , and most of them use the green - kubo relation , except the nonequilibrium simulation of  @xcite , which used a so - called nonequilibrium simulation method to produce a macroscopic velocity gradient . we find that the simulations predicted values that are larger , by about a factor of two , than our result for the green - kubo relation using experimental input",
    ".    the discrepancy between our result here and the simulation results in fig .  5 could arise from the differences between the simulations and the experiment  @xcite .",
    "these differences include the use of periodic boundary conditions in the simulations to mimic an infinite system , while the dust particles in the experiment fill a finite region due to dc radial electric fields . while all particles in the simulations are identical , those in the experiment vary in diameter by a few percent  @xcite , with a similar variation in charge .",
    "nonuniformities occur in the simulations only as transients due to fluctuations , while the experiment has static nonuniformities due to the dc radial electric fields .",
    "these dc fields induce static stresses that can lead to more structural disorder which can result in an easier deformation of the arrangement of dust particles and a reduction in the stress required to generate shear flow , which is equivalent to a reduction of the viscosity .",
    "another possible explanation for the discrepancy with the simulation results is that the potential in the experiment  @xcite may not be exactly a debye - hckel potential , as assumed in sec .",
    "iv  a. one alternative , instead of assuming a particular form for the potential , could be an empirically determined potential of mean force , calculated from an experimentally - measured pair correlation function , as has been proposed theoretically  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that all physical processes that affect the potential would be included in the empirical result  @xcite .",
    "the green - kubo relation for viscosity has been tested using an input of experimental data .",
    "the value for the viscosity determined by the green - kubo relation with the input of data from an experiment  @xcite was compared to the value from a previous experiment using a hydrodynamical method  @xcite . in both experiments",
    "the physical system was a quasi-2d dusty plasma , and the conditions were similar , aside from the absence of a macroscopic velocity gradient in the experiment  @xcite for the green - kubo result .",
    "we found that the results agree as well as can be expected .",
    "this agreement serves as our test of the green - kubo relation for viscosity of a dusty plasma .    additionally , we compared our result for the viscosity determined by the green - kubo relation with the predictions of md simulations  @xcite .",
    "the results were as consistent as expected , given the differences between the simulations and the experiment  @xcite that provided our input data .",
    "further tests are needed for other green - kubo relations . because the green - kubo relations for the various transport coefficients are all different , a test of the green - kubo relation for viscosity , as we have presented here , does not also serve as a test of another green - kubo relation .",
    "in addition , tests for other physical systems , such as the 2d systems mentioned in sec .",
    "i , would be useful .",
    "the different roles of the dust particles and the neutral gas in determining the transfer of momentum can be illustrated by comparing a dusty plasma to a dilute colloidal suspension .",
    "the latter consists of two components : solid particles and a liquid solvent such as water , which have comparable mass densities . if the solid particles are sufficiently small , they are dragged along in the flow of the solvent , so that the local velocities of the solid particles and solvent are nearly the same , g.k .",
    "batchelor , _ op .",
    "cit_. then , the two components of a dilute colloidal suspension can be considered to be moving as one , which has an effective viscosity that is slightly larger than that of the pure solvent according to einstein s result : a. einstein , ann .",
    "phys . * 34 * , 591  ( 1911 ) .",
    "a dusty plasma is different because instead of a liquid solvent there is a rarefied gas , which is many orders of magnitude less dense .",
    "then the dust particles can flow with a velocity that is different from that of the rarefied gas as a whole .",
    "this difference in velocity between a dust particle and the gas as a whole leads to a friction between them , which is different from the viscous friction due to collisions amongst the dust particles via their electrical repulsion .",
    "non - isotropic models have been developed to take into account the effects of ion wakes , which arise from a flow of ions that is driven by the same vertical electric field that levitates the dust particles .",
