    "the current research on multiferroic materials is motivated by both an incomplete understanding of their fundamental physical properties and their potential in realizing novel devices which would make use of static or dynamic magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling in non - volatile memories , spintronics , magnonics and microwave devices . for practical applications ,",
    "a strong me coupling near room temperature is required .",
    "bifeo@xmath6 , the most intensively studied multiferroic , exhibits a large ferroelectric ( fe ) polarization and multiferroicity up to 643k .",
    "however , its spiral magnetic structure persists up to an external magnetic field of 19 t and , therefore , the me coupling is rather low up to 18t.@xcite much larger me coupling was observed in spin - order - induced ferroelectrics.@xcite unfortunately , most of these materials exhibit multiferroic properties only below ca .",
    "nevertheless , some ferrites with hexagonal symmetry , called hexaferrites , exhibit magnetic - field - induced electric polarization close to or even far above room temperature and their me coupling can be very high.@xcite    based on their chemical formulas and crystal structures , hexaferrites can be classified into several types : _",
    "m_-type , such as @xmath7 , _ y_-type @xmath8 , _",
    "w_-type @xmath9 , _",
    "z_-type @xmath10 , _ x_-type @xmath11 , and _",
    "u_-type @xmath12 , where me is a bivalent metal ion ( e.g.  co , mg , zn).@xcite the structures of hexaferrites can be described as sequences of three basic building blocks ( usually denoted by _ s ,",
    "r _ , and _ t _ ) periodically stacked along the _ z _ axes .",
    "since the hexagonal structures of hexaferrites are associated with centrosymmetric @xmath13 or @xmath14 space groups , no fe polarization should exist in these materials .",
    "nevertheless , their ferrimagnetic structures are spiral or heliconical and they can be easily changed by external magnetic field to transverse conical , where an electric polarization of the order of tens of @xmath15 can appear due to the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( @xmath16 ) between non - parallel spins @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the centrosymmetric structure should be broken and the crystal symmetry lowered .",
    "importantly , the magnetic field needed to induce a polarization can be very low ( of the order of millitesla ) and the effect can be remanent.@xcite by contrast , the polarization disappears in higher magnetic fields ( usually above 2 t ) when the magnetic structure changes.@xcite    me properties of the z - type hexaferrite @xmath19 were reported first time by kitagawa _ _ et al.__@xcite they discovered that this highly resistive material exhibits magnetic - field induced electric polarization at least up to 300k .",
    "me and magnetodielectric effects in @xmath20 were confirmed later by other authors.@xcite chun _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite investigated @xmath21 and discovered that the me effect is the highest in @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , for this composition , the magnetic structure changes from transverse conical to collinear ferrimagnetic structure at a temperature as high as 400k , so the me effect can be measured well above room temperature.@xcite    in general , depending on the crystal and magnetic structures , the me coupling may be due to one of three different mechanisms : exchange striction ( magnetostriction @xmath23 ) , inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction or spin - dependent hybridization of the _ p _ and _ d _ orbitals.@xcite the same mechanisms can be also responsible for the dynamic me coupling , which activates magnons in the thz or far - infrared _ dielectric permittivity _ spectra and therefore they are called",
    "_ electromagnons_.@xcite by contrast , common magnons impact only upon the magnetic susceptibility spectra in the microwave or thz ranges .",
    "they are also called ferromagnetic ( fmr ) and antiferromagnetic resonances , and their frequencies correspond to acoustic - like and optic - like magnons , respectively , with wavevectors @xmath24 from the brillouin - zone center ( @xmath25 ) . as for electromagnons , they have frequently wavevectors out of the brillouin - zone center ( @xmath26 ) and they can be excited by thz photons ( with a wavevector @xmath27 ) only if the magnetic structure is modulated , which is true in practically all spin - order - induced multiferroics . as regards the hexaferrites ,",
    "an electromagnon was reported only in the @xmath28-type compound @xmath29.@xcite interestingly , it was observed not only in the spin - induced fe phase below 50k , but also in the paraelectric one at 90k , if an external magnetic field ( @xmath30 ) was applied ; in that case the magnetic structure changed from proper screw to longitudinal ( for @xmath31 ) or transverse conical ( for @xmath32).@xcite the activation of the electromagnon in * * e**@xmath33 polarized spectra was explained by the exchange striction , although the static electric polarization * * p**@xmath34 in hexaferrites comes from the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction.@xcite    since the @xmath35-type hexaferrites @xmath36 exhibit ferrimagnetic phase transitions at temperatures as high as @xmath37 700k and me coupling up to nearly 400k , one can expect electromagnons to be activated in their thz spectra at much higher temperatures than in @xmath28-type hexaferrites . for that reason we have performed detailed thz time - domain , infrared ( ir ) , raman and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins )",

    "the two excitations near 44 and 57@xmath5 are phonons .",

    ".    the first difference can be possibly a consequence of an angular dependence of the mode frequency ( oblique mode ) relevant to the single - crystalline ceramic grains ( in fact , this raman mode was observed only in few grains , and we suppose that their @xmath51 crystal axes were oriented almost parallel to the sample surface ) .",
    "the second observation could be theoretically owing to somewhat different ba concentrations in the ceramics ( @xmath99 ) and the single crystal ( @xmath2 ) , but since we know that the magnetic structure is identical for both compositions , this possibility is not likely .",

    "since the excitation is observed in the transverse conical magnetic structure , we propose that it is activated by the exchange striction mechanism .",
    "a spin excitation with a similar frequency was discovered in raman spectra .",
    "should it be the same electromagnon , the sample would be fe with a polarization @xmath100 and the @xmath66 space group .",
    "this is rather unlikely , because up to now , only @xmath119 oriented polarization was observed and the numbers of phonon modes observed in the ir and raman spectra are much lower than those allowed in the fe phase . nevertheless , further structural , magnetoelectric and second - harmonic - generation experiments appear necessary to clearly prove or disprove a polar phase in @xmath0 .    upon applying magnetic field higher than 3 t ,",
    "in the low - frequency part of the thz spectra , a narrow excitation appears whose frequency linearly increases with magnetic field .",
    "its behavior is independent on temperature ( investigated up to 250k ) and since the proportionality constant of the resonance frequency on the magnetic field corresponds to the gyromagnetic ratio of a free electron , we interpret this excitation as the ferromagnetic resonance .",
