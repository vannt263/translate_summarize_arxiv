    "we consider a differential problem of advective viscous flow in a domain @xmath0 , and let @xmath1 a computational grid on @xmath0 with an initial grid step @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a sistem of cartesian coordinates for the representation of the nodes . in 1d",
    "the grid is a linear set of _ nodes _ , in 2d is a plane surface where nodes are vertices of squares with edge length equal to @xmath2 , in 3d is a set of adjacent cubes with squares of edge @xmath2 as faces ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . the grid is said _ adaptive _ if , during the evolution in time , its points are clustered in regions of high flow - field gradients , so that the step @xmath2 can change ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if * x * is the vector of the cartesian coordinates of a node and @xmath3 is the time variable , then for an adaptive grid we have @xmath4 . + we consider a real positive _ grid - field _",
    "@xmath5 on @xmath1 defined on the nodes , i.e. if @xmath6 is an index parameter of the @xmath6-th node and @xmath7 is the total number of nodes , we have @xmath8 .",
    "assume that this field represents a physical or logical property associated to the flow , e.g. the number of fluid particles that interact by molecular forces with the particle on @xmath6-th node , or the number of possible nodes where a particle can move from time @xmath3 to time @xmath9 using the physical rules of the flow .",
    "as other example , in the particular matter of numerical weather prediction the topography of ground can influence heavly the computation of metheorological variables ; its geometry is modelled by special grid using _ terrain - following _ coordinates ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting possible interpretation for @xmath10 is the number of values @xmath11 of the velocity field , computed at time @xmath3 on nodes of index @xmath12 , that we could use in a numerical scheme for computing the value @xmath13 on @xmath6-th node at time @xmath9 with the desidered accuracy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ from these examples we can assume that @xmath5 has high values in the regions of @xmath0 where the flow is turbulent or in general not laminar ; in these cases , e.g. , for a good accuracy of a numerical approximation of the velocity field * u * at time @xmath9 , the number of values @xmath11 , computed at time @xmath3 , for computing the value @xmath14 at @xmath6-th node can be greater then the number necessary for computing * u * at a node placed , at time @xmath3 , in a region of laminar flow ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , where the grid step @xmath2 has small values , the grid field @xmath5 can have high values .",
    "+ we apply to field @xmath5 the methods of a _ scale - free network _ , known in scientific literature as _ barabsi networks _ ( @xcite ) , assuming that the flow at time @xmath9 on a node of the grid depends on the flow computed at time @xmath3 at @xmath6-th node with a _ probability function _",
    "so defined :    @xmath15    using a _ continuum approach _ , barabsi and albert ( @xcite ) assume that @xmath10 is a continuous real variable and the rate at which it changes is proportional to @xmath16 :    @xmath17    in @xcite the factor of proportionality @xmath18 is supposed in general constant .",
    "but if we want to describe an adaptive grid as a network changing in space and time , we suppose that the parameter @xmath18 is in general a function depending on the node and on time variable :    @xmath19    in this case the grid becomes a scale - free network of nodes with _ fitness _ , using the terminology of bianconi and barabsi ( @xcite ) . also , the dependence on the grid variable * x * suggests to consider the possibility of a law like ( [ rate1 ] ) with the gradient @xmath20 at first member .",
    "+ the analytical dependence of @xmath18 from @xmath21 and @xmath3 is determined by the physical and logical properties of the flow , such as viscosity , density , geometry of domain @xmath0 and the velocity field * u * itself .",
    "hence in general we suppose that the mathematical expression of @xmath18 is determined by a _",
    "constitutive relation _ such as , e.g. ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the dynamical viscosity of the fluid .    in the next section",
    "we ll present some possible examples of choices for the analytical shape of the function @xmath24 .",
    "+ consider @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "from ( [ rate1 ] ) and the fact that by hypothesis the field @xmath5 is positive , we can write    @xmath27    if @xmath28 is the set of initial ( @xmath29 ) values of @xmath5 , we have    @xmath30    and therefore    @xmath31    the previous equation gives the relation between the value of the grid field @xmath5 on the @xmath6-th node and the variable parameter @xmath18",
    ". we can write it as a field equation in this way :    @xmath32    now we state the relation between the variable grid step @xmath4 and the grid field @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath33 two _ contiguous _ nodes of @xmath1 , e.g. @xmath34 in 1d , or the nodes are two vertices of the same edge of a geometrical cube in 3d .",
    "if @xmath35 is the value of grid step between the nodes , according to the previous discussion we assume that @xmath36 depends on the inverse of the arithmetic mean of the grid field values :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is a real positive function .",
    "if the grid is very fine , for every @xmath39 exists a topological neighbour @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , @xmath42 . in this case",
    "we can assume @xmath43 and , using ( [ kexp2 ] ) , it is convenient to use the following definition :    @xmath44",
    "in all the next applications we assume @xmath38 constant and @xmath45 with @xmath46 constant . we discuss some possible constitutive relation for the function @xmath18 .",
    "+ _ case 1_. let @xmath47 for all nodes and for every @xmath3 .",
    "then , from ( [ kexp1 ] ) , follows that @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , from ( [ step1 ] ) , we have @xmath49 , that is the grid is constant in time but it can be etherogeneous . in particular , if @xmath50 , then the grid is homogeneous .",
    "this is the case appropriate for a laminar flow , for which , in general , an adaptive grid is not strictly necessary .",
    "+ _ case 2_. let @xmath51 . in this case",
    "@xmath52    and    @xmath53    let @xmath54 . in this case",
    "the values of grid step at time @xmath55 are smaller than the corresponding values at time @xmath3 , so we can compute , as previously discussed , the velocity field of a flow which has a complexity growing in time .",
    "the flow is asintotically turbulent in all points of the domain @xmath0 .",
    "+ let @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the values of grid step at time @xmath55 are greater than the corresponding values at time @xmath3 .",
    "the flow is asintotically laminar in all points of the domain @xmath0 .",
    "+ we can consider the particular case for which @xmath50 and @xmath57 . in this case",
    "@xmath58 , therefore the grid step @xmath2 is homogeneous in @xmath0 and    @xmath59\\ ] ]    _ case 3_. according to adaptive mesh refinement methods ( e.g. @xcite ) , grid step values can strictly depend on flow velocity gradient @xmath60 .",
    "also , if the shape of domain @xmath0 is constant in time and the viscosity @xmath23 of the fluid is a variable in space ( and in time ) , the grid @xmath1 should be refined in the regions of turbulence , and in particular where @xmath23 has small values ( @xcite ) .",
    "for these reasons we can assume , as first approximation , that the parameter @xmath18 is constant in time and depends only on the ratio @xmath61 , under the hypothesis @xmath62 .",
    "using a formal taylor expansion , we write    @xmath63    where @xmath64 are constants in all the grid @xmath1 .",
    "+ if @xmath65 , then @xmath66 and we obtain the situations described in the previous cases .",
    "the flow becomes laminar or turbulent , depending on the sign of @xmath67 .",

    ", we can expand to first order the exponential expression and obtain    @xmath73    from ( [ step2 ] ) the grid step is    @xmath74    consider a fixed @xmath75 . if @xmath76 , then the grid step for computing the solution at time @xmath9 becomes    @xmath77    in general , if @xmath78 , for those regions in @xmath0 where at time @xmath3 the viscosity @xmath23 has very small values , from ( [ case3h1 ] ) follows that    @xmath79    this result is coherent with usual conditions of numerical stability for differential problems where the advective terms are dominant ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we show how , at least in a simple differential problem where the theorical solution is known , is possible to determine the grid field @xmath5 .",
    "+ we consider the one - dimensional diffusion - transport problem ( @xcite )    @xmath80    where @xmath23 and @xmath81 are positive constants .",
    "if @xmath82 , case of dominant transport , the theorical solution is well approximated by the function    @xmath83    which presents a boundary layer effect at @xmath84 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "[ expfig1 ]        for a good accuracy of a numerical resolution based on a possible numerical scheme , as finite differences or finite elements , we should impose a condition on the _ local pclet number _ @xmath85 , that is @xmath86 .",
    "for the dominant transport situation , the condition implies that a constant grid step @xmath2 could be very small , with large computational cost for the numerical resolution . from fig.1",
    "we can see that the theorical solution has significant positive values only for @xmath87 , therefore for the resolution of the boundary layer effect we might construct a grid with a variable step @xmath88 , where @xmath2 is decreasing on , e.g. , @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "+ because we want @xmath2 ever smaller when @xmath90 , on the basis of the _ case 2 _ of the preceding section , we suppose that the entities @xmath18 and @xmath91 are constant , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , but from next considerations follows that should be sufficient the ratio @xmath94 be constant .",
    "therefore , from ( [ kexp1 ] ) , considering the unique variable @xmath95 of the problem :    @xmath96    we suppose for simplicity @xmath97",
    ". then @xmath98 , and from ( [ step2 ] ) follows that @xmath99 , so    @xmath100    let @xmath101 , @xmath102 , the node from which we impose the condition @xmath86 . from definition of pclet number",
    "we have    @xmath103    and , with no restriction , we can impose @xmath104 for the @xmath6-th node . in this way we obtain the required value for @xmath105 :    @xmath106    for our aim , the argument of the logarithmic function must to be greater then @xmath107 , so the value of @xmath108 can be choosen so that @xmath109 . note",
    "that , from ( [ bvp1 ] ) , @xmath110 , so that we can consider the equation ( [ m0s ] ) as a constitutive relation of kind ( [ constitutive1 ] ) :    @xmath111    using ( [ h ] ) , the adaptive grid nodes greater than @xmath112 can be so determined ( see fig.2 ) :    @xmath113    [ expfig2 ]        in the numerical case of fig.[plotfig3 ] , we have @xmath114 therefore the number of nodes for this heterogeneous grid is only few greater than the number of nodes for the homogeneous grid with @xmath115 and , as shown in fig.[plotfig3 ] , using the same numerical scheme the solution in the first case is more accurate than the solution in the latter .",
