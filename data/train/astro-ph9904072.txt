    "there are several indications , but not really a proof of solar neutrino oscillations ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    \\i ) the result of all five solar neutrino experiments are below the predictions of ssm calculations ;    \\ii ) unless neutrino oscillate , the experimental results for gallium , chlorine and water detectors are hardly consistent among themselves , even if some experimental result is discarded ;    \\iii ) the measured gallium signal , @xmath7 snu , is below the minimal value expected by the luminosity constraint , @xmath9 snu , for standard neutrinos",
    ".    future experiments like borexino @xcite and lens@xcite , aiming at the detection of be - neutrinos from @xmath10 can be crucial for the solar neutrino puzzle , since oscillation schemes predict unambiguous seasonal modulations and/or drastic reductions with respect to the predicted flux @xcite : @xmath11 this flux is a very robust prediction of ssm calculation , see @xcite for a discussion . the quoted @xmath12 error is dominated by uncertainty on the @xmath13 cross section , as emphasized in @xcite and in @xcite",
    "this uncertainty alone contributes as much as all astrophysical uncertainties ( metal abundance , opacity , luminosity , diffusion ... ) combined together .",
    "nevertheless , eq . ( [ eq_bessm ] ) represents the outcome of an involved solar model calculation , and it is useful to provide a lower limit in the absence of oscillations , @xmath3 , which is essentially independent of the ssm .",
    "such is the aim of the present note .",
    "as well known , be - neutrinos give a significant contribution to the gallium and chlorine signals , being respectively about one fourth and one sixth of the total , according again to the ssm . the lower limit on @xmath14",
    "can thus be used to determine lower limits to the gallium and chlorine signal , in the absence of oscillations .",
    "the b - neutrinos from @xmath15 have been observed by kamiokande@xcite and superkamiokande @xcite . since b - neutrinos and be - neutrinos",
    "are both sons of @xmath16 nuclei , one expects that detection of the former gives information on the latter .",
    "our aim is to determine a lower limit on the production rate of be - neutrinos , @xmath17 , starting from this consideration .",
    "as the rates of ( [ ecap ] ) and ( [ pcap ] ) depend differently on the solar temperature , we need some information on it . this is ( indirectly ) provided by helioseismology , which determines the sound speed with an accuracy of one per cent or better , even close to the solar center , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "temperature is obtained from the sound speed if the chemical composition of the solar plasma is known .",
    "this is the only information which we shall take from ssms , in the form of the hydrogen abundance at the solar centre @xmath18 , a quantity which is largely independent of solar models , since it reflects the amount of hydrogen burnt all along the sun history .",
    "let us make this argument in some detail .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath19 luminosities , at production , can be written as : @xmath20 where we have used a parametrization of the form @xmath21 , the temperature scale @xmath22 is chosen as the central temperature of the model in @xcite , hereafter bp98 , @xmath23 k , and according to @xcite : @xmath24 ( here and in the following errors shown are combinations in quadrature of systematic and statistical @xmath12 errors ) .    by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) one can relate the production rates of boron and beryllium neutrinos . from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) one has :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the ratio of free protons to electrons .",
    "since temperature decreases sharply when moving away from the solar center , one can assume that at any point in the solar interior @xmath27 , where , here and in the following , the suffix @xmath28 refers to the solar center .",
    "in this way one has :    @xmath29    as the produced @xmath30 can oscillate into species with a smaller or vanishing cross section in the detector , the observed luminosity @xmath31 in kamiokande and superkamiokande can not exceed the produced luminosity , @xmath32 , so that one has the following lower limit for @xmath33 : @xmath34    now we use the fact that the solar center can be described as perfect gas of fully ionized h and he , to a very good approximation . in terms of",
    "the isothermal squared sound speed @xmath35 and of the hydrogen mass fraction @xmath36 , this gives : @xmath37 .",
    "one also has : @xmath38 . in this way",
    "one gets : @xmath39    the equation above can of course be translated in terms of fluxes .",
    "we take @xmath40 @xmath1 s@xmath2 from @xcite and @xmath41 , in agreement with helioseismic determinations , see @xcite .    for the central hydrogen abundance we have to rely on solar model calculations .",
    "recent ssm calculations all yield @xmath18 in the narrow range @xmath42 , with a mean value close to the bp98 estimate , @xmath43 , see table [ tabxc ] .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath18 is sensitive to opacity , metal abundance and nuclear cross sections , see table [ tabxc2 ] .",
    "the @xmath12 uncertainty on opacity and metal abundance are respectively 5% and 6% , according to @xcite and @xcite , and that on @xmath44 is 1.7% , from @xcite . by computing suitable solar models and adding errors in quadrature , we conclude : @xmath45    we have also computed @xmath18 for a series of `` non standard solar models '' , where some input parameters have been varied , one at the time , by about @xmath46 with respect to the ssm reference input , see table [ tabxc ] . even in this case",
    ", @xmath18 stays in the range 0.329  0.358 , i.e. within about @xmath47 from bp98 .",
    "we remark that @xmath18 is essentially an indicator of how much hydrogen has been burnt so far , starting from an initial value @xmath48 about 0.7 .",
    "the stability of @xmath49 corresponds to the fact that any solar model has to account for an integrated solar luminosity of about @xmath50 erg . on these grounds ,",
    "we consider the adopted value of @xmath18 as rather safe .    in this way",
    "we get : @xmath51 where the error include , in quadrature , all uncertainties mentioned above .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath52 , @xmath18 and @xmath53 contribute to the total error 16% , 13% and 12% respectively .",
    "the inequality ( [ eqfibe ] ) defines a minimum flux @xmath54 @xmath1 s@xmath2 , which is one fifth of the ssm prediction , see eq .",
    "( [ eq_bessm ] ) .",
    "we note that the only input from ssm is the value of @xmath18 , whereas all other inputs , @xmath55 and @xmath53 , are from observational data .",
    "we have obtained this minimal flux using only the physical information that is relevant to the ratio between the beryllium and boron luminosities @xmath56 ; for instance , the actual value of @xmath57 never matters for our result .",
    "however , the additional physical information that determines the two fluxes separately , in particular the measured @xmath58 , can only strengthen this limit .",
    "in fact , a solar - model - independent analysis of the beryllium and boron neutrino flux production ( @xmath59 , cross sections more than @xmath6 s away from the central values , profiles of densities that are not constrained by helioseismology varied by factors larger than 30 ) shows that the lower limit to @xmath60 is @xmath61  @xmath1  s@xmath2 , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "3 of ref .",
    "@xcite and the measured @xmath58 .",
    "the relevance of the bound ( [ eqfibe ] ) can be appreciated when discussing the complementarity between borexino and lens .",
    "we remind that lens is sensitive to @xmath30 only , whereas the signal of borexino can get contribution also from @xmath62 or @xmath63 , their cross section being about 1/5 than that of @xmath30 .    for both experiments , a signal well below 1/5 of the ssm prediction will be a definite proof of neutrino oscillations , since it leads to a violation of eq .",
    "( [ eqfibe ] ) .    a signal at the level of 1/5 of the ssm prediction in borexino could be interpreted as due to small mixing ( sm ) angle oscillations into active neutrinos , where one expects that all @xmath30 from beryllium have been transformed into @xmath62 .",
    "however , one could still insist on standard neutrinos , arguing for some drastic ( maybe desperate ) modification of the solar model . in this situation ,",
    "a clear discrimination will be provided by lens : for the sm case , the lens signal , barrying the background , has to vanish , so that the bound ( [ eqfibe ] ) will be violated , giving a definite proof of neutrino oscillations ( furthermore , the comparison with borexino will show the presence of @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) .",
    "as well known , the solar luminosity essentially fixes the total production rate of neutrinos .",
    "since neutrino cross sections increase with energy , the minimal gallium signal , in the absence of oscillations , can be estimated by assuming that the total flux consists of pp neutrinos only .",
    "the pep - neutrinos can be safely included in this estimate , as the ratio of pep to pp - neutrinos is well known and essentially unsensitive to solar physics details , see @xcite and @xcite . by using updated cross sections from @xcite ,",
    "this arguments gives as a minimal gallium signal in the absence of oscillations : @xmath66 where the error arises mainly from the capture cross section of pp neutrinos .",
    "as well known , also b - neutrinos contribute to the gallium signal .",
    "their contribution is best estimated by using experimental data .",
    "if one takes into account the flux measured by superkamiokande , with the capture cross section of @xcite , this contributes an additional @xmath67 snu , where most of the error comes again from the capture cross section .",
    "all this results in : @xmath68    according to the previous discussion , one has to include now the minimal contribution of @xmath16 neutrinos . for @xmath69 by using the luminosity constraint ( see section 2.4 of @xcite ) one has an additional contribution of @xmath70 snu , where most of the error comes from @xmath52 , so that in conclusion the minimal gallium signal is now : @xmath71 this has to be compared with the gallex @xcite and sage@xcite average : @xmath72    all this means that the present experimental result is about three sigmas below the minimal expectation in the absence of oscillations .",
    "this also illustrates the potential of gno @xcite , the successor of gallex , which should reduce the total error down to about 4 snu .",
    "if the present central value is mantained , the discrepancy with the minimal prediction will be at the level of about @xmath73 , thus providing a clean signature of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the solar luminosity constraint , together with the assumption that the ratio of pep - neutrinos over pp - neutrinos @xmath74 is correctly determined by ssm calculation , can be used to provide a lower limit also for the chlorine signal .    as well known , due to the fact that cross sections increase with neutrino energy , the minimal signal",
    "is obtained by maximixing the number of lowest - energy neutrinos , consistent with the luminosity constraint . since a flux @xmath75 of pp - neutrinos",
    "is anyhow accompanied by a flux @xmath76 , this implies a minimal chlorine signal : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the solar constant , @xmath79 is the average electromagnetic energy released for emitted @xmath80-neutrino ( see @xcite ) and @xmath81 is the averaged @xmath80-neutrino cross section on chlorine detector . by using the cross section from @xcite , but for the absorption cross section of @xmath82 neutrinos from @xcite ,",
    "one has : @xmath83    from the superkamiokande result one can deduce the b - neutrinos contribution of @xmath84 snu , so that : @xmath85 the minimal be - neutrino flux implies the additional contribution of @xmath86 \\nonumber \\\\              & = & ( 0.24 \\pm 0.06 ) \\ , { \\mbox{snu } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this way the minimal chlorine signal becomes : @xmath87 to be compared with the experimental result @xcite @xmath88    again the be - neutrinos contributions , eq .",
    "( [ cl4 ] ) , corresponds to the  @xmath12  uncertainty of the experimental result , and again the experimental signal is about three sigmas below the minimal prediction",
    ".      a global view of the  solar neutrino puzzle  is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which updates fig . 7 of @xcite . as a generalization of eq .",

    "the shaded area , corresponding to the region within @xmath90 from each experimental result , is almost completely out of the physical region .",
