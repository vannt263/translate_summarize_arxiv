    "in analogy to the connection between electromagnetic and van der vaals potentials , we may perceive the hadronic force as a residuum of the strong interaction that occurs between quarks and gluons  the constituents of hadrons .",
    "therefore , the knowledge of the interaction of hadrons is interesting not only on its own account but also since it delivers information about the structure of hadrons and the strong interaction itself .",
    "the fact that fourty years after the discovery of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons  @xcite their interactions with nucleons remain so weakly established , indicates that it is rather challenging to conduct research which could deliver information about this interaction . the scattering length   the very basic quantity describing the low energy interaction potential   in the case of the @xmath2 meson",
    "is poorly estimated , and in the case of the @xmath3 meson it is entirely unknown . estimated value of the real part of the proton-@xmath2 scattering length varies from 0.25  fm to 1.05  fm depending on the approach employed for its determination  @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle in the experimental studies involving any of _ neutral _ ground state mesons is too short life  time which prohibits their utilization as secondary beams .",
    "therefore the study of their interaction with hadrons is accessible only via observations of their influence on the cross section of the reactions in which they were produced ( eg .",
    "@xmath4 ) .",
    "the influence of the relatively weak nucleon-@xmath2 interaction may be magnified when producing the meson in the vicinity of two nucleons . in this context",
    "the @xmath5 system reveals to be particularly interesting since neither the @xmath6 nor the @xmath7 interaction is strong enough to form a bound state and so the @xmath5 system may occur to be borromean .",
    "it was pointed out by wycech  @xcite that the large enhancement in the excitation function of the @xmath0 reaction observed close to the kinematical threshold can be described assuming that the proton - proton pair is produced from a large object of a 4  fm radius . yet , at present it is still not established whether the low energy @xmath5 system can really form a borromean or resonant state .",
    "though the significant progress in the understanding of the production mechanism on the hadronic level has been achieved  @xcite , the final state system was always treated approximately utterly ignoring the @xmath2-proton final state interaction .",
    "only , very recently the rigorous three - body approach has been applied for the description of the observed excitation function and two - particle invariant mass spectra of the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "two independent approaches by deloff  @xcite and fix & arenhvel  @xcite revealed that the rigorous three body treatment of the final state leads to the results significantly different from the two - body approach even when the @xmath2-proton interaction is completely disregarded .",
    "also a very important conclusion drawn in reference  @xcite is that the role of the final state interaction depends crucially on the range of the primary reaction dynamics , showing that the inaccuracy of establishing contributions from the exchange of various mesons limits the inferences about the interaction among the final state particles .",
    "the data which stimulated the development of the abovementioned three body formalism will be presented hereafter .",
    "for the better visualisation of the effects due to the proton-@xmath2 interaction we will compare the shape of the excitation functions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions and will discuss the observed differences . in the next section which constitutes an extraction from the more comprehensive treatise  @xcite we will present only the excitation function and for the details concerning the differential distributions the reader is referred to the more exhaustive experimental  @xcite and theoretical elaborations  @xcite .",
    "the determined energy dependences of the total cross section for @xmath3  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite mesons production in proton - proton collisions are presented in figure  [ cross_eta_etap ] . comparing the data to the arbitrarily normalized phase space integrals ( dashed lines )",
    "reveals that the @xmath5 fsi enhances the total cross section by more than an order of magnitude for low excess energies .",
    "one recognizes also that in the case of the @xmath3 meson the data are described very well ( solid line ) assuming that the on - shell proton - proton amplitude exclusively determines the phase space population . in the case of @xmath2 meson production",
    "the interaction between nucleons is evidently not sufficient to describe the increase of the total cross section for very low and very high excess energies , as can be concluded from the comparison of the data and the upper solid line in figure  [ cross_eta_etap ] .",
    "this line was normalized to the data at an excess energy range between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the enhancement of the total cross section for higher energies can be assigned to the outset of higher partial waves , and the discrepancy visible closer to the threshold can be plausibly explained by the influence of the attractive interaction between the @xmath2 meson and the proton .",
    "a similar effect close - to - threshold is also observed in the data of photoproduction of @xmath2 via the @xmath10 reaction  @xcite indicating to some extent that the phenomenon is independent of the production process and rather is related to the interaction among the @xmath2 meson and nucleons .",
    "the dotted  line in figure  [ cross_eta_etap ] corresponds to the simple phenomenological treatment  @xcite based on the factorization of the transition amplitude into the constant primary production and the on - shell incoherent pairwise interaction among outgoing particles .",
    "although it describes the enhancement close - to - threshold very well , it fails to describe the invariant mass distribution of the proton - proton and proton-@xmath2 subsystems determined recently at q  =  15  mev by the cosy - tof  @xcite and at q  =  15.5  mev by the cosy-11  @xcite collaborations .",
    "it was suggested in reference  @xcite that the bump in the invariant mass spectra may be due to the contribution from higher partial waves .",
    "however , the amount of the p - wave admixture derived from the proton - proton invariant mass distribution spoils significantly the agreement with the data at low values of q ( see dashed - dotted line in figure  [ cross_eta_etap ] ) .",
    "another explanation proposed is based on the anticipation that the production amplitude may vary with energy  @xcite .",
    "however , both listed approaches neglected the proton-@xmath2 interaction and only now the first calculations with the rigorous treatment of the three - body final state including both proton - proton and proton-@xmath2 interaction are available .",
    "and although biased with neglection of the coulomb effect  @xcite or imaginary part of the proton-@xmath2 scattering length  @xcite they herald a fully rigorous explanation of the observed spectra .",
    "the work has been supported by the daad exchange programme ( ppp - polen ) and by the polish state committee for scientific research ( grant no .",
