    "the idea of pseudospin was introduced to explain the quasi - degeneracy in some nuclei between single - nucleon states with quantum numbers ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 + 3/2 ) where @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath6 are the radial , the orbital , and the total angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively .",

    "about 30 years ago @xcite , the underlying mechanism of pseudospin symmetry in nuclei has become a topic of intense theoretical research . in a recent letter @xcite",
    ", we have shown the dynamical character of this symmetry in nuclei , arising from balance effects among the central nuclear potentials parameters .",
    "we have also concluded that this dynamical behavior of the symmetry is the main explanation for the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear pseudospin orbit interaction observed in nature . in this paper",
    "we elaborate on the main topics of that letter , extending our analysis for different nuclei .",
    "it is worth reviewing the main results of several papers @xcite in which the possible underlying mechanisms to generate pseudospin symmetry have been discussed .",
    "a helicity unitary transformation of a non - relativistic single - particle hamiltonian was considered by blokhin _",
    "they showed that the transformed radial wave functions behave as @xmath14 moreover , they claimed this behavior to be universal and conjectured that , at small distances , the helicity transformed mean field of a heavy nucleus should not be much different from the untransformed one , since the behavior of @xmath15 remains similar to @xmath16 near the origin . at larger distances , however , as suggested by the above asymptotic behavior of the transformed wave function , the helicity transformed mean field would acquire a more diffuse surface . at the same time",
    ", the helicity transformed fields would get strongly nonlocal at the surface .",
    "the application of the helicity operator to the non - relativistic single - particle wave function maps the normal state @xmath17 onto the  pseudo \" state @xmath18 , while keeping all other global symmetries @xcite .    a similar kind of unitary transformation was also considered earlier to discuss the pseudospin symmetry in the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , if the ratio of the coefficients of spin - orbit and orbit - orbit terms in the single - particle spherical nilsson hamiltonian has a particular value , pseudospin symmetry will be exact .",
    "@xcite showed that this value was approached by relativistic mean field ( rmf ) estimates for that ratio .",
    "more recently , the subject was revived when ginocchio @xcite recognized , for the first time , the relativistic character of the symmetry .",
    "he noted that the pseudo - orbital angular momentum is just the orbital angular momentum of the lower component of the dirac spinor .",
    "he also showed that pseudospin symmetry is an exact symmetry for the dirac hamiltonian with an attractive scalar potential , @xmath19 , and a repulsive vector potential @xmath20 , when these potentials are equal in magnitude : @xmath21 .",
    "it turns out that this symmetry is nothing but a su(2 ) symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian @xcite",
    ".    in rmf models , often referred to as quantum hadrodynamics @xcite , the nuclear saturation mechanism is explained by the cancelation between a large scalar and a large vector fields @xcite . typical values for these fields in heavy nuclei are of the order of a few hundred mev ( with opposite signs ) , their sum providing a binding potential of about @xmath22  mev at the center .",
    "therefore , it was natural for ginocchio to regard the quasi - degenerate pseudospin doublets in nuclei as arising from the near equality in magnitude of the attractive scalar , @xmath19 , and the repulsive vector , @xmath20 , relativistic mean fields , @xmath23 , in which the nucleons move .    after the work of ginocchio , meng _",
    "@xcite showed that pseudospin symmetry is exact when @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",

    "one may note that the latter condition implies the former if @xmath32 at large distances , which is the case of the nucleus .",
    "however , this criterium presents several practical problems that are not easily overcome @xcite , namely it can not be applied in the range of values of @xmath33 for which @xmath34 .",

    "the structure of radial nodes occuring in pseudospin levels and a classification for the intruder levels ( states which do not have a pseudospin partner in the limit of pseudospin symmetry ) was explained as a direct effect of the behavior of nodes of dirac bound states @xcite , giving support for the relativistic interpretation of nuclear pseudospin symmetry . however , despite these reports on the quasi - degeneracy of pseudospin doublets , the nature of pseudospin breaking in nuclei is not fully understood .    in this paper",
    "we address this question by studying the splittings of the neutron single - particle energy levels for pseudospin partners obtained by solving the dirac equation with vector and scalar potentials of woods - saxon type . from the behavior of these splittings with woods - saxon parameters , we are able to show that pseudospin symmetry has a dynamical character . as we have already pointed out , the present paper is a natural extension of @xcite , providing more technical details and complementary physical information .",
    "in addition , we calculate the expectation value of the pseudospin - orbit coupling and find that it correlates well with the observed pseudospin splittings .",

    "our purpose here is to go further and investigate whether there is also a correlation between those splittings and the shape of the mean - field nuclear potential , namely its radius and surface diffuseness .    to this end",

    "therefore , the study of pseudospin partners splittings as a function of these parameters is meaningful and realistic enough to be applied to most nuclei , at least qualitatively .",
    "it is known that , in certain isotope chains , the central depth and the surface diffuseness changes sensibly @xcite . at the same time , as the mass number @xmath99 increases , the nuclear radius increases according to the @xmath100 law , which means that it is also important to study the role of the parameter @xmath16 in pseudospin symmetry .    using woods - saxon potentials for @xmath47 and @xmath56 , we solved numerically the coupled first - order dirac equations for the radial fields @xmath101 and @xmath102 obtained by factoring out the angular wave functions of @xmath57 in eqs .",
    "( [ dirac_first ] ) .",
    "they read    [ dirac_first_radial ] @xmath103    where @xmath104    there are altogether six parameters for @xmath47 and @xmath56 , namely the central depths , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , two radii and two diffuseness parameters .",
    "we observed that the pseudospin splitting is not sensitive to @xmath16 and @xmath98 of the @xmath56 potential , and , accordingly , set the same radius , @xmath16 , and surface diffuseness , @xmath98 , for both potentials .",
    "we first fit these parameters to the neutron spectra of @xmath37pb .",
    "the quality of our fitting is showed in fig .  1 , where the results of the present calculation ( ws ) are shown , together with the experimental values and those obtained using a relativistic mean field approach ( model g1 of ref",

    "the parameters used for the fit are given in the caption of fig .",
    "1 . for the present purpose ,",
    "our fitting is quite reasonable . keeping @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath16 fixed , we vary @xmath98 in order to see how the energies of the pseudospin doublets are sensitive to the surface diffuseness .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "2 . as @xmath98 increases , the splittings of the pseudospin doublets decrease .",
    "this could be expected because the derivative of @xmath47 decreases when @xmath98 increases . however , by further increasing @xmath112 , the pseudospin doublet partners cross each other , inverting the sign of the energy splitting .",
    "this inversion of pseudospin partner splittings , @xmath113 changing to @xmath114 , is observed experimentally and was also found in  @xcite .",
    "it also occurs for calcium isotopes , analyzed below .",
    "it is important to note that , once the pseudospin doublet partners cross each other , i.e. , the pseudospin splitting changes sign , the effect of increasing @xmath98 is to drive the pseudospin doublets further apart .",
    "this systematics is consistent with the non - relativistic prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite as shown by the asymptotic behavior of the radial wave function ( [ blokhin ] ) .",
    "a similar trend is seen when we let the radius @xmath16 vary , fixing all other parameters .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "3 . when the radius increase , the energy splittings increase , which again can be understood by the dependence of @xmath115 with @xmath16 .",
    "however , we found that the dependence of the pseudospin splitting on @xmath16 is the opposite for the deepest energy levels , which means there are also some surface effects in this trend .",
    "this does not happen when the diffusivity changes , the trend being the same for all levels .",
    "here we can see again the phenomenon of level crossing for the pseudospin partners @xmath108 . for @xmath116 fm we could not get bound solutions for one or both @xmath117 , @xmath118 levels .",
    "this dependence on @xmath16 is especially important when comparing different isotopes , since , in many cases , it is the radius of the mean - field potentials that changes most noticeably . finally , we keep @xmath98 , @xmath16 and @xmath106 fixed but vary @xmath105 in order to study the sensitiveness of the pseudospin doublets with the depth of the central @xmath119 mean field potential .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  4 and",
    "the following behavior is observed : as @xmath120 decreases , the splitting also decreases .",
    "this is in accordance with ginocchio predictions for pseudospin symmetry breaking due to the finiteness of the @xmath47 mean field .    from fig .  4 we see that the decreasing of @xmath121 shifts the levels @xmath122 to the continuum",
    "we also found that , for a deeper pseudospin doublet , an inversion of pseudospin energy splitting occurs for sufficiently low @xmath121 .    actually , we have found that @xmath121 and @xmath16 are not completely independent parameters .",
    "varying @xmath121 and @xmath16 but keeping @xmath98 and the product @xmath123 fixed , the pseudospin splittings remain almost constant , as shown in fig .",
    "we observed that varying the other free parameter , @xmath106 , does not qualitatively change the splittings .",
    "since the @xmath56 potential is related to the effective mass of the nucleons , the basic effect is to slightly change the nucleon separation energies , and especially the spin - orbital coupling , as discussed below .",
    "although the woods - saxon potential is expected to be a good approximation for central potentials of heavy nuclei like lead , some calculations indicate that it might also be good enough for lighter nuclei such as calcium @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to show the importance of the surface diffuseness and of the radius in the dynamical pseudospin symmetry , we applied our model also to two calcium isotopes , where the pseudospin splitting is also small .",

    "the difference between the @xmath39ca neutron potential with respect to the @xmath38ca neutron potential lies basically in a smaller modulus of the central depth and in a larger radius .",
    "we also see that the magnitude of pseudospin energy splitting decreases from 0.9  mev to 0.4  mev as the number of nucleons @xmath99 increases . since the levels @xmath134 and @xmath135 are inverted in @xmath38ca , the effect of the change in @xmath16 predicted by the systematics",

    "one sees that the contribution for the pseudospin energy splittings of the @xmath141 term is larger than the splitting itself and it is at least of the same order of magnitude and has the opposite sign of the kinetic and @xmath142 terms .",

    "one the other hand , these figures show a clear correlation between the pseudospin - orbital term and the pseudospin energy splitting when the diffusivity and the depth of @xmath47 potential are varied .",
    "this feature does not depend on the particular pseudospin doublet under consideration .",
    "the pseudospin - orbital term ( @xmath141 ) comes from the coupling between the upper and the lower components .",
    "this term will vanish only when the upper component is zero ( assuming a non - zero lower component ) or when @xmath146 , showing again that exact pseudospin symmetry is possible only when there are no bound states .",

    ", this term will vanish when the lower component is zero , which corresponds to the non - relativistic limit .    from the results presented so far",
    ", we can conclude that the degeneracy of pseudospin levels is very much dependent on the shape of the nuclear mean field potential : the actual choice of the potential parameters , fitted to describe a nucleus , determines whether or not there is pseudospin symmetry .",
    "furthermore , it is the strong cancelation presented in figs .  68 that produces the quasi - degeneracy of pseudospin levels .",
    "the conclusion is that pseudospin symmetry is a dynamical symmetry in nuclei , in the sense of arima s definition of dynamical symmetry  @xcite : ( i ) a symmetry of the hamiltonian which is not geometrical in nature ; or ( ii ) a ordered breaking symmetry from dynamical reasons .",
    "this dynamical nature of pseudospin symmetry is further stressed by the fact that pseudospin levels can cross each other .",
    "we observe also that the realization of pseudospin symmetry depends on the doublet in consideration , although the systematics is the same for all pseudospin partners .",
    "we apply now this systematics to some nuclei studied in the literature , looking at the differences between neutron and proton spectra as far as pseudospin symmetry is concerned .",

    "this phenomenon can also be observed in @xmath37pb , as one can see from the experimental energy values of the pseudospin partners @xmath143 @xmath122 in fig .",
    "1 . we do not expect our ansatz for the nuclear central potentials to explain the behavior of levels very near the nucleus surface .",
    "such fine details are outside the scope of our work , which simply intends to establish a broad systematics for pseudospin splittings in nuclei .    for zr isotopes , studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , although the authors did not provide details on the potentials , again one sees that the pseudospin splitting in general decreases with @xmath99 , with a somewhat irregular behavior for the partner @xmath152 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the splitting for the doublet ( @xmath153 ) decreases to the point of level crossing .",

    "we observe that the central neutron depth , @xmath105 , varies from about @xmath154 mev to @xmath155 mev and the surface diffuseness increases whereas the proton central depth , @xmath105 , varies from @xmath156 mev to @xmath22 mev and the surface diffuseness slightly increases .",
    "the reason lies on the @xmath157 meson interaction , which for a neutron rich nuclei is repulsive for the neutrons and attractive for the protons , as explained by mean field model calculations @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of this interaction , which is important in asymmetric nuclei , changes the vector part of the potential @xmath20 to @xmath158 with + and @xmath126 signs for protons and neutrons respectively ; @xmath159 is the time component of the @xmath157 field , which is proportional to the number of protons minus the number of neutrons , and @xmath160 comes from the vector - isoscalar @xmath161 meson .",
    "the increase of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath98 with @xmath99 can be traced back to the known nuclear radius @xmath100 dependence and to the excess of neutrons on the surface ( neutron skin effect ) .",
    "hence , we may conclude that , for a given nucleus , the parameters @xmath105 , @xmath98 and @xmath16 for protons and neutrons are different . then",
    ", an isospin asymmetry in the pseudospin interaction is expected to take place in agreement with the analysis of the mean field nuclear parameters for protons and neutrons done in  @xcite . in particular , since @xmath159 is negative for heavy nuclei , the vector potential ( [ v_rho ] ) is bigger ( and , thus , @xmath162 is smaller ) for neutrons than for protons . from our previous analysis , for a neutron rich nucleus",
    ", pseudospin symmetry for the neutron spectrum is favored , in agreement with the results presented by lalazissis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the systematics discussed here seems to be quite general and a comment on how it affects the spin - orbit splittings is pertinent .",
    "spin - orbit splittings are much less changed by variations of the central depth and surface diffuseness of the nuclear potential than pseudospin - orbit splittings .",
    "the reason is that to change substantially spin - orbit splittings one needs a significant relativistic content , i.e. , a large lower component in the dirac spinor @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting is completely correlated with the nucleon effective mass @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ upper ] ) , we see that it will depend strongly on @xmath56 .",
    "this potential itself carries a quite large scale when compared with @xmath47 ( around a factor ten ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath157 meson potential , @xmath163 , generally about ten percent of @xmath47 , becomes irrelevant compared to @xmath56 .",
    "this justifies why the spin - orbit interaction is roughly isospin symmetric , being almost the same for neutrons and for protons @xcite .    on the contrary",
    ", the pseudospin splitting needs less relativistic content , i.e. , a smaller lower component in order to change .",
    "this may explain why the non - relativistic analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite of the origin of the pseudospin symmetry , and manifested by eq .",
    "( [ blokhin ] ) , works well to explain the small pseudospin splitting .",
    "the pseudospin orbit interaction depends on @xmath47 , as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ lower ] ) .",
    "this means that now @xmath163 can not be neglected , since its values are comparable to those of @xmath47 , causing sensibly different variations of the central depth for neutrons and protons , for which @xmath163 has different signs .",
    "this is one of the mechanisms generating the isospin asymmetry in the pseudospin - orbit interaction , as we have pointed out before .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "9 , where the energy splittings for the pseudospin partners @xmath151 , @xmath143 and for spin - orbit pairs @xmath164 , @xmath165 are plotted . here",
    "we have just fixed the radius and diffusivity , using the values that fitted the neutron spectrum of @xmath37pb , and let both @xmath105 and @xmath106 change by the same amount , thereby simulating the increase of the vector potential @xmath20 that affects @xmath47 and @xmath56 in the same way .",
    "it is clear that the splittings change much less for the spin - orbit doublets than for the pseudospin doublets .",
    "the magnitude of the change depends on the specific level one considers , but we checked that this kind of behavior occurs for deep levels . of course",
    ", one should also consider the effect of the coulomb potential for proton spectra , which has the opposite sign of @xmath166 for protons .",
    "however , we expect the effect of @xmath166 to be dominant for neutron rich nuclei .",
    "we have studied , through a mean - field model calculation with woods - saxon potentials , the role played by the surface diffuseness , the radius , and the central depth of the sum of the standard vector and scalar nuclear potentials in the energy splittings of pseudospin partners , both for lead and calcium isotopes .",
    "this study allowed us to draw a systematics for the behavior of the pseudospin splitting as @xmath98 , @xmath16 and @xmath105 vary .",
    "such behavior was confirmed when we applied the systematics to the sn nuclei isotope chain , predicting the observed general trend towards degeneracy of pseudospin doublets . based on our findings and in general features of the neutron and proton potentials",
    ", we explained the observed isospin asymmetry of pseudospin splittings .",
    "we were able to identify a pseudospin - orbital term and found that its contribution to the pseudospin energy splittings is large .",
    "the near degeneracy of pseudospin levels is obtained from a significant cancelation among the different terms in the schroedinger - like equation for the lower component of the dirac spinor .",
    "we also showed a clear correlation between the pseudospin - orbital term and the pseudospin energy splitting when the diffusivity and the depth of @xmath47 potential are varied .",
    "these findings led us to argue that pseudospin symmetry in nuclei is dynamic .",
    "we believe that the systematics observed in our model calculation and the non - perturbative nature of the pseudospin - orbit term , which is larger than the energy splitting itself and needs to be canceled in order to produce the pseudospin quasi - degeneracy may help to understand how the pseudospin symmetry is dynamically broken in nuclei .",
