    "the most recent data of the electron - proton ( ep ) scattering experiments at slac [ 1 - 3 ] have played a significant role in investigating the hadron structure . in the last decade , many trails have been executed to deal with the ep scattering problem .",
    "the glauber multiple scattering approach [ 4 ] was used to present an eikonal picture for the ep scattering .",
    "the quantum chromodynamics qcd [ 5,6 ] was developed as the most convincing present theory for the interactions between those constituent quarks , formulated in terms of the exchange of colored vector gluons . at sufficiently high values of @xmath0",
    ", the running strong coupling constant is expected to become small enough , due to the properly of asymptotic freedom , to allow the use of perturbation theory to simplify qcd . however , there is considerable controversy as to how large a value of @xmath0 is sufficient for perturbative quantum chromodynamics pqcd [ 7 ] .",
    "the exclusive processes such as electron proton ( e - p ) scattering are predicted to have a single dimensional scaling [ 8 ] at large @xmath0 . in this case",
    "only the valance quark states are important and a rough idea of the @xmath0 dependence can be gained by simply counting the number of quark - gluon vertices .",
    "elastic form factor , for example , should scale asymptotically as @xmath1 , where n is the number of valance quarks participating in the interaction . for ( e - p ) scattering n=3 thus the structure function behaves as @xmath2 .",
    "perturbative qcd [ 7 ] predicts calculable logarithmic departures from the @xmath0 dependence of exclusive amplitudes given by the simple dimensional scaling law . the earliest efforts [ 9 ] used unrealistic symmetric distribution amplitudes and required a large multiplicative factor to normalize the results to the data at @xmath0 @xmath3 .",
    "chernyak and zhitnitsky [ 10,11 ] proposed a model form for the nucleon distribution amplitude which satisfies the sum rules and in which the momentum balance of the valance quarks in the proton is quite asymmetric .",
    "the result of this model is justified in the diquark model [ 12,13 ] .",
    "the nonperturbative calculations succeeded in modeling the region @xmath4 fairly well but some difficulties have been found at large values of @xmath0 . by this article",
    "we aim to develop the eikonal optical picture of the ( ep ) scattering on the bases of the born multiple scattering of the incident electron with the constituent valance quarks of the target hadron .",
    "the paper is organized so that in section 2 , we present the hypothesis and the mathematical formalism of the model .",
    "results and discussion as well the comparison with experimental data are given in section 3 .",
    "during the electron - proton ( e - p ) scattering , we consider the proton as a bag including three valance quarks .",
    "we proceed using the semi - classical born approximation which is a useful technique when the de broglie wavelength of the incident particle is sufficiently short compared with the distance in which the potential varies appreciably . in this approximation",
    "we consider the multiple scattering series in which the projectile interacts repeatedly with the potential and propagates freely between two such interactions .",
    "we expect that the born series converges if the incident particle is sufficiently fast so that it can not interact many times with the potential and/or if the potential is weak enough . starting with a plane wave as a zero order wave function of the incident electron , and by successive iteration ,",
    "the nth order of the born scattering amplitude is given by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , is the zero order plane wave and , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the free green s function . let us denote by @xmath9 and @xmath10 the coordinates of the incident electron and the constituent valance quarks of the target proton . according to the first born approximation , the scattering amplitude is given by : @xmath11",
    "@xmath12    this term represents the two - body scattering amplitude or the impulse approximation .",
    "the second born approximation is , @xmath13 which represents the double scattering term in the scattering amplitude .",
    "a(@xmath14 ) is the average potential acting on the incident electron due to the target valance quarks ri with initial and final states @xmath15 and @xmath16 so that , @xmath17 in the present situation we consider that the electron - quark ( eq ) potential to be a pure coulomb with the form , @xmath18    and @xmath19 is the relative coordinate @xmath20 the term @xmath21 may be expanded in terms of the spherical harmonics @xmath22 as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the greater ( the lesser ) of @xmath14 and @xmath25 .",
    "the radial integral of eq.(3 ) may be divided into two parts :    @xmath26    \\(10 ) and substitute for @xmath24 by @xmath27 in the first integral and for @xmath28 by @xmath29 in the second integral . then writing @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the average potential due to the @xmath32 quark , then @xmath33    @xmath34 @xmath35    the evaluation of @xmath36 for the three quark system differs only in their signs due to the charge situation . on the other and",
    "the differential cross section is calculated either in terms of the multiple scattering born approximation amplitude , @xmath37    or in terms of the two body scattering amplitude with a proton form factor correction .",
    "@xmath38    here , @xmath39 is the scattering amplitude of the electron scattering by a point - like proton . the proton form factor f(q )",
    "is also an important physical quantity which reflects information about the particle structure .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath40 @xmath41    as the model is a phenomenological type , it is then branches in two ways , + i ) the first one assumes that quarks are confined inside the bag by an extremely deep potential , and the quark states are reasonably represented by a harmonic oscillator wave function .",
    "+ ii ) the second way assumes that the constituent quarks behave as almost free particles as is suggested by experiments of deep inelastic scattering [ 1,14 ] .",
    "however , in all cases the @xmath42 scattering is treated as the collision between the high energy incident electron with a composite proton system .",
    "proceeding with the first assumption ( i ) and assuming a harmonic oscillator wave function for the valance quarks ,    @xmath43    then the average scattering potential is ; @xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the incomplete gamma function of order 3/2 .",
    "the scattering amplitude and the differential cross section are to be calculated numerically .",
    "moreover , the form factor is calculated for the proton system as ,    @xmath46    considering now the second case ( ii ) of elastic scattering and that all quarks are in the 1s ground state of a coulomb wave function ,    @xmath47    a is the proton radius , then @xmath48 consequently , @xmath49\\ ] ] @xmath50 ^ 2\\ ] ] and the form factor is then , @xmath51",
    "data used in this article are those from the experiments coded slac - e-140 [ 1 ] at low momentum transfer extended from 1 to 3 @xmath52 using electron beam of energy 8 gev , and slac - e-136 [ 2 ] at a wide range extended from 2.9 to 31.3 @xmath52 .",
    "the later was conducted using accelerated electrons with energies from 5 to 21.5 gev were elasticaly scattered by protons in a liquid -hydrogen target at stanford linear accelerator center .",
    "the center of mass energy of the reaction is found in terms of the energies @xmath53 of the scattered electron and proton respectively and their opening angle @xmath54 .",
    "the differential cross section is calculated in the frame of multiple scattering using eq.(14 ) for both the experiments slac - e-136 and slac - e-140 .",
    "the result of calculation as well as the experimental data are displayed in figs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively . it is found that only the first two terms of the born series give appreciable contribution to the differential cross section .",
    "the second term contributes for not more than 10 @xmath56 in all cases .",
    "the calculations are carried out using harmonic oscillator wave function ( solid lines ) and coulomb wave function ( dashed lines ) for the valance quarks forming the proton system .",
    "the experimental data are reproduced to a limited extend by the harmonic oscillator wave function only at low momentum transfer region . on the other hand",
    "the use of the coulomb wave function shows better representation of the data at high momentum transfer .",
    "this result reflects the fact that quarks inside the hadron are quite confined at low momentum transfer region while at high momentum transfer , quarks behave more freely and the confinement condition becomes no longer necessary .",
    "however , the comparison with the experiment shows also that the multiple scattering approach could nt give satisfactory agreement particularly at high momentum transfer regions .",
    "the differential cross section is recalculated in terms of the proton form factor according to eqs.(15 - 16 ) .",
    "proceeding the same analogy , so that the proton form factor is calculated twice using the harmonic oscillator and the coulomb wave functions .",
    "the result are displayed in fig.(3 ) compared with data of the experiment slac - nh-11 [ 3 ] as well as the prediction of the simple dipole model of the following form , @xmath57 the prediction of eq .",
    "( 15 ) is displayed with the experimental data in figs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) for the experiments e-136 and e-140 respectively .",
    "it is clear now that the two body scattering amplitude corrected with a relevant form factor may reproduce the experimental data quite well , assuming harmonic oscillator wave function for the constituent quarks . in the above calculations , we use the units where @xmath58 , hence the momentum in gev / c may be represented in units of @xmath59 with a conversion factor 0.2 in all the above cases",
    "the potential parameters are determined by the chi- square fitting method . a root mean square radius of the proton is found to be 0.8 and 1.0 fm on using the harmonic oscillator and the coulomb wave functions respectively",
    ". the distribution of the hadronic system produced in e - p scattering is measured by zeus collaboration [ 15 ] at center of mass energy of 296 gev .",
    "comparison of the results with the qcd radiation has a strong influence on the characteristics of the final state .",
    "the data are reasonably reproduced by the lund model based on a matrix element calculated in the first order of @xmath60 , followed by a appropriate parton shower , as well as by the color dipole model .",
    "the herwing parton shower model also gives a reasonable representation of the data .",
