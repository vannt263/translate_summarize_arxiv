    "phenomenological / empirical models are generally used in order to cover the dynamics in systems of hadrons .",
    "one such model , the eth model , was put forth in the early 1990s to account for the pion - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction at low energies .",
    "the eth model may be considered to be the product of the long - term study of the properties of pionic - atom data of isoscalar nuclei ( i.e. , of nuclei containing equal numbers of protons and neutrons ) within the framework of the relativistic mean - field theory of the 1980s ; the principal aim at those times was the explanation of the long - standing problem of the @xmath4-wave repulsion in the @xmath15-nucleus interaction ( save for pionic hydrogen and @xmath16 , the strong shifts of the @xmath17 levels in pionic atoms are repulsive ) @xcite . in its original form",
    ", the model did not contain the spin-@xmath18 contributions of the @xmath19 ; in the early 1990s , the emphasis was placed on the reproduction of the experimental results obtained at pion laboratory kinetic energy @xmath20 mev , i.e. , at the @xmath0 threshold . the first attempts to reproduce the energy dependence of the then - available ( and nowadays outdated ) @xmath0 phase shifts , even above the @xmath19 resonance , turned out to be successful after the inclusion in the model of the spin-@xmath18 contributions of the @xmath19 graphs @xcite .",
    "essential in the foundation of the model was ref .",
    "@xcite ; analytical expressions for the contributions of the main feynman graphs ( simply ` graphs ' hereafter ) of the model to the @xmath4- and @xmath6-wave @xmath8-matrix elements appeared in a compact form in appendix a of that paper .    in a series of subsequent papers ,",
    "two @xmath0-related issues were mainly addressed : a ) the reproduction of the low - energy ( @xmath21 mev ) @xmath10 elastic - scattering and charge - exchange @xmath22 ( cx ) data @xcite , including the extraction of the values of the low - energy constants ( lecs ) of the @xmath0 system , and b ) the violation of isospin invariance in the hadronic part of the @xmath0 interaction   interaction was presented in ref .",

    "the model was also involved in an iterative procedure which resulted in the determination of the electromagnetic ( em ) corrections @xcite , i.e. , of the corrections which must be applied to the @xmath0 phase shifts and to the partial - wave amplitudes on the way to the evaluation of the low - energy observables , namely of the differential cross section ( dcs ) and of the analysing power ( ap ) .",
    "the long - term use of this model has demonstrated that it can account for the experimental information available at low energies almost as successfully as simple parameterisations of the @xmath8-matrix elements @xcite , which do not contain theoretical constraints other than the expected low - energy behaviour of these elements .",
    "one may thus conclude that the model constitutes a firm basis for the parameterisation of the dynamics of the @xmath0 system at low energies .",

    "the expressions may ( occasionally ) appear long , yet they can be implemented in a numerical analysis without much effort . * due to its importance in qcd tests , the evaluation of the @xmath0 @xmath12 term is of high significance in hadronic physics .",
    "there has been only one occasion in the past , in which we treated the @xmath12 term in the context of the model @xcite . the expression given",
    "therein was a tree - level approximation ; as a result , we had been reluctant , throughout our programme , to give the model predictions for the @xmath12 term alongside our results for other lecs . in the present work ,",
    "we revisit the subject and show that the @xmath12 result , extracted with a method featuring a few lecs of the @xmath0 system , is in good agreement with the value obtained with the simple expression of ref .",
    "* to make our analysis self - contained ( i.e. , independent of extraneous information on the @xmath23 and @xmath9 waves ) , it is needed to include in the model the @xmath4- and @xmath5-channel contributions with the well - established @xmath23 and @xmath9 hbrs as intermediate states .",
    "however , the theoretical treatment of ( four out of six of ) these fields is either too intricate ( propagation of spin-@xmath24 particles ) or not at all existing ( propagation of spin-@xmath25 particles ) .",
    "the hope is that the present work will stimulate interest in the theoretical treatment of these fields .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : general ] , we deal with the description of the kinematics of the @xmath0 system and with the definitions of the various quantities used in the present study ; these details are usually ` assumed known ' in the scientific literature , urging the interested reader to search in books or to derive the expressions .",

    "@xcite were proven in the 1990s to be inconsistent with the modern measurements comprising ( most of ) today s database . in any case , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite indicated a large strange - quark content of the proton and stimulated interest in this subject , which culminated in the introduction and evaluation of two sizeable corrections .",
    "apart from the determination of @xmath578 , corrections were also applied to the original @xmath12 value of ref .",
    "@xcite : using updated values of the @xmath0 lecs , ref .",
    "@xcite suggested a downward correction by about @xmath582 mev .",
    "the modern measurements indicate an enhanced ( more positive ) isoscalar component in the @xmath0 scattering amplitude at low energies ; this becomes evident after comparing koch s isoscalar @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath583 @xcite with the result of table [ tab : slii ] .",
    "using most of today s database , ref .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath584 mev .",
    "we conclude the present subsection with one additional remark .",
    "it is not clear which the appropriate definition of the @xmath12 term is in a framework where the hadronic part of the @xmath0 interaction violates isospin invariance @xcite . in all probability ,",
    "the effects induced by this effect are sizeable ; for instance , it is long known that the position of the cd point on the @xmath1 axis is strongly affected by the nucleon - mass splitting ( i.e. , by the proton - neutron mass difference , see the last part of subsection 8.1.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  562 ) .",
    "we are not aware of any works addressing this subject .      regarding the extraction of the @xmath12 value from the data ,",
    "one may come up with two advantages of the model over schemes employing dispersion relations .    * the graphs of the model",
    "lead to uniquely defined @xmath8-matrix amplitudes at all @xmath135 points , including those in the unphysical region @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that the extrapolation of the model amplitudes into the unphysical region would be straightforward .",
    "we will shortly explain why this is not entirely true .",
    "* the determination of the @xmath12 value involves the use of low - energy @xmath0 data exclusively ; the data at @xmath585 mev do not influence our results .",
    "the importance of this remark is revealed after recollecting that the energy dependence of the partial - wave amplitudes in analyses using dispersion relations is ( almost entirely ) determined from the high - energy data .",
    "we have already commented on the mismatch at low energies between the amplitudes obtained from the entire @xmath0 database and those extracted exclusively on the basis of low - energy @xmath0 data @xcite , in particular in the @xmath4 waves .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of setting forth a @xmath12-evaluation scheme , also incorporating our unitarisation prescription of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq57 ] ) .",
    "however , a number of problems render this goal hard to achieve . to start with",
    ", the implementation must inevitably involve the entirety of each partial - wave amplitude .",
    "unfortunately , as the nucleon born - term contribution is removed from the hadronic part of the scattering amplitude , prior to its extrapolation into the unphysical region , the prescription of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq57 ] ) is inapplicable .",
    "we have not yet found a way to circumvent this problem .    to obtain a prediction for the @xmath12 term within the context of our model ,",

    "using the relations of subsections [ sec : poledelta ] and [ sec : nonpoledelta ] , one can prove that the @xmath19 contribution to the isoscalar amplitude @xmath284 at the cd point is independent of the parameter @xmath361 and reads as : @xmath590 summing up the contributions of the @xmath19 and @xmath470 graphs , we finally obtain : @xmath591 using the results of our fits to the low - energy @xmath10 elastic - scattering data ( as explained in the beginning of section [ sec : results ] ) , we obtain from eq .",
