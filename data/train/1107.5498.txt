    "[ fig : phasediag ] which displays two main phases ( apart from the critical line @xmath22 and @xmath32 ) : a columnar phase of dimer which breaks the translational symmetry and the rs phase .",
    "the columnar phase , first proposed by vekua and honecker  @xcite along the mg line @xmath33 , emerges naturally as the combination of two dimerized chains with their dimer patterns in phase .",
    "the physical picture of the transition is the following : starting from @xmath22 , we have two dimerized chains between which the interchain antiferromagnetic coupling will favor rvb fluctuations leading to the alignment of their dimers ( reminiscent of two - dimensional  @xcite columnar phases ) and a lowering of the order .",
    "rvb fluctuations enhanced by larger @xmath2 eventually destroy the dimer order through an ising second - order transition to the rs phase ( as expected for a single - component order parameter , the transition corresponding to breaking a discrete @xmath34 symmetry ) .",
    "as we will see , the triplet gap remains finite across the phase diagram and on the transition line between these two distinct spin - liquid phases .",
    "this melting of the dimer crystal is driven by the low - energy fluctuations which lie in the singlet sector .",
    "the transition line has a remarkable non - monotonic behavior showing a reentrance of the rs phase at small @xmath2 when increasing the frustration @xmath1 .",
    "this shape can be understood on simple qualitative grounds : the order parameter and spin gap in the @xmath0-@xmath1 chain ( along the @xmath22 line ) typically have a steep increase above the transition point and then a slow decrease for large @xmath1 . considering @xmath2 as a perturbation , the larger the initial order , the larger @xmath2 is required to destroy it .",
    "this argument is all the more valid as the magnitude of @xmath2 along the transition does not exceed @xmath35 .",

    "there , we may conjecture that the transition line qualitatively follows the behavior of the @xmath22 order parameter and should therefore exhibit an exponential - like opening @xmath40 close to @xmath41 and an exponential tail @xmath42 at large @xmath12 .",
    "the last remarkable feature of this phase diagram is the onset of incommensurability which is a typical signature of frustration , already present at the classical level .",
    "as already recalled in the case of the frustrated spin chain , the onset of incommensurability depends on choosing the correlations in real or reciprocal spaces , or looking at the dispersion relation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] , we chose the standard definition for the onset of incommensurability as the appearance of an incommensurate wave - vector in the real - space spin correlations .    in the following sections , we explain how these results are obtained and describe in details the physics throughout the phase diagram using several observables .",

    "we check that the dimers are aligned on each legs and not staggered , which would be the other possible pattern on a ladder but energetically less favorable in this model .",
    "therefore , we drop the leg index @xmath19 in the following . due to obc",
    ", friedel oscillations develop in the dimer order from the edges which decay exponentially in both the columnar and rs phases ( away from the transition ) and contain incommensurate oscillations in the incommensurate regime . ignoring these oscillations to keep only the envelope of the friedel oscillations , their typical behavior near the edges",

    "additional 2d ( and 3d ) couplings  @xcite between ladders are expected to play an important role : ( i ) to reduce the spin gap and ( ii ) to account for impurity - induced ordering at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "another argument in favor of non - negligible inter - chain effects comes from the field - induced magnetization curve  @xcite . taking all these facts into account , it is reasonable to argue that the most realistic model for the spin ladder material bicu@xmath3po@xmath4 should integrate both ingredients : in - leg frustration @xmath1 _ and _ higher - dimensional inter - ladder couplings .",
    "however , depending on the properties we want to investigate , dimensionality effect may matter or not .",
    "for instance , impurity - induced ordering at finite temperature is clearly a 3d effect  @xcite , as well as nmr lines broadening at low temperature  @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the incommensurate response is expected to be a 1d effect simply because the frustration is present only along the legs .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : incommensurate - q ] , one can see that if @xmath196 ( which seems to be the case for bicu@xmath3po@xmath4 ) , an incommensurate response is already expected for @xmath197 .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments on single crystal samples may allow for a direct evaluation of the incommensurate wave - vectors @xmath26 and @xmath28 which should help to determine the frustrated character of this material .",
    "the evaluation of the amount of frustration in bicu@xmath3po@xmath4 from susceptibility measurement requires to fit the full range of temperature to capture both the spin gap and the maximum @xmath198 of the susceptibility on equal footing .",
    "inter - ladder interactions will also affect the spin gap and the many - magnons effects relevant in the intermediate and high temperature regimes .",
    "a simple unfrustrated model of coupled ladders has been shown using qmc simulations ( unable to tackle frustrated models because of the sign problem ) to correctly reproduce the low temperature part of the susceptibility while the maximum of @xmath199 was not correctly described  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the high temperature part and the reduced value of @xmath198 was correctly captured by a 1d model including frustration ( using ed ) but at the expense of a spin gap largely overestimated  @xcite .",
