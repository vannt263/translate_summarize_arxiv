    "this sum arises naturally in the analysis of binomial queues where brown @xcite gave upper and lower bounds @xmath27    generalizing @xmath28 allows the `` weights '' to be any polynomial of @xmath29 .",

    "its simplest form arises when analyzing the worst - case running time of bottom - up mergesort .",
