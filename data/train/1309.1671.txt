    "haumea is a large , triaxial kbo ( semi - axes @xmath8 km ) , with a very fast rotation ( period @xmath9 hr ) , a rock - rich interior ( bulk density @xmath10 kg m@xmath7 ) and a surface covered in high - albedo ( @xmath11 ) , nearly pure water ice , which shows signs of variegation .",
    "haumea has two , nearly coplanar satellites with similarly icy surfaces .",
    "at least 10 other kbos have been associated with haumea on the basis that they have similar orbital elements and water - ice - rich surfaces .",
    "the origin of this so - called haumea family is unclear .",
    "proposed , ad - hoc scenarios include a giant impact onto the proto - haumea @xcite , a gentler graze - and - merge collision @xcite and a sequence of two collisions in which the first creates a moon which is the target of the second collision @xcite . the first scenario is ruled out by the low velocity dispersion of the family members , while the last two possibilities are arguably improbable .",
    "furthermore , the mass in the currently known family members and their velocity dispersion is not ideally matched by any of the proposed scenarios @xcite",
    ".    noticed that one member of the haumea family , 2003@xmath0sq@xmath1 , displayed large photometric variation , @xmath121 mag peak - to - peak , in just 14 measurements .",
    "they estimated a periodicity of about 3.7 hr ( or twice that ) for this object .",
    "such large variability in 200 km - scale objects often indicates extreme shapes from which useful information can be extracted @xcite .",
    "here we report time - resolved , follow - up observations of 2003@xmath0sq@xmath1(hereafter sq@xmath1 ) obtained to clarify the nature of this object and the cause for the extreme variability and to improve our understanding of the haumea family .",
    "we find that sq@xmath1  indeed has an extreme shape , most simply explained by a compact binary , although more data are needed to rule out a single , elongated shape .",

    "the full extent of this variation is seen on multiple nights .    to search for periodicity in the data we employed two methods : the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ; * ? ? ? * ) and the string - length minimization ( slm ; * ? ? ?",

    "we favour the double - peaked solution , @xmath52  hr , for three reasons .",
    "firstly , a single - peaked lightcurve with a variation @xmath53 mag would have to be caused by a peculiar , large contrast , surface albedo pattern .",
    "the symmetry and regularity of the lightcurve suggest that the brightness variation is modulated instead by the elongated shape of sq@xmath1  as it rotates ; lightcurves produced by shape are double peaked .",
    "secondly , the double - peaked solution produces a lightcurve with slightly asymmetric minima , seen on more than one night .",
    "the single - peaked lightcurve minimum exhibits more scatter suggesting that it is a superposition of two different minima .",
    "finally , the single - peaked period , @xmath50  hr , would imply very fast rotation , at which sq@xmath1  would likely experience significant centripetal deformation for a plausible range of bulk densities and inner structures .",
    "the resulting elongated shape would produce a double - peaked lightcurve invalidating the premise that the lightcurve is single - peaked .",
    "high resolution analysis near the @xmath54  hr lightcurve indicates a pdm minimum at @xmath55  hr , while using the slm method , we obtained a best - fit period @xmath56  hr .",
    "we take as best - fit solution the mean of the two , @xmath57  hr . to estimate the uncertainty in our period solution we employ @xcite    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the uncertainty in the lightcurve frequency , @xmath60 is the standard deviation of the lightcurve best - fit residuals ( calculated using the model shown in figure [ fig : binarylightcurvefit ] )",
    ", @xmath47 is the number of data points , @xmath48  hr is the total time spanned by the observations , and @xmath61  mag is the lightcurve variation . the frequency uncertainty is @xmath62 hr@xmath63 which corresponds to an uncertainty in the spin period @xmath64  hr . we therefore adopt as best period @xmath3  hr .",
    "owing to their large heliocentric distances , kuiper belt objects are only observable from earth at small phase angles , @xmath65 .",
    "our observations span an approximate range @xmath66<0.95 $ ] and we see a trend of fainter apparent magnitude with increasing phase angle .",
    "we fitted this observed phase darkening with a weighted linear model of the form    @xmath67    where @xmath36 is the absolute magnitude at zero phase angle and @xmath38 is the linear phase curve coefficient .",
    "the fit is plotted in figure [ fig : phasecurve ] where we show apparent magnitudes at lightcurve maxima .",
    "the best - fit zeropoint and slope are @xmath46 mag and @xmath5 mag/@xmath6 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and does not follow the trend for shallower phase functions observed in other objects associated with haumea @xcite .",

    "further , we attempt to fit the lightcurve of sq@xmath1  using jacobi ellipsoid and roche binary hydrostatic equilibrium models . the choice of models of hydrostatic equilibrium is physically based and has the benefit of allowing the density of sq@xmath1  to be estimated .",

    "the roche binary model received further support as qg@xmath111  was re - observed in 2010 to show a predicted decrease in variability to @xmath114 magnitudes , which allowed the obliquity of the system to be estimated at very near 90@xmath6 @xcite .    with @xmath115 mag and @xmath104",
    "hr , sq@xmath1  lies at the threshold between the jacobi and roche sequences .",
    "indeed , we find that sq@xmath1  can be fitted reasonably well both by jacobi and roche models",
    ". however , one important feature of the lightcurve , the asymmetric lightcurve minima , is only naturally fitted by the roche binary model .",
    "the jacobi model misses the data points that mark the faintest point of the lightcurve ( figure [ fig : ellipsoidlightcurvefit ] ) . in theory , a special arrangement of brighter and darker surface patches could be adopted to ensure that the jacobi model fit the fainter lightcurve minimum .",
    "however , the binary model does not require any further assumptions and thus provides a simpler explanation for the asymmetric lightcurve minima .",
    "figure [ fig : variationchange ] plots the change in lightcurve variation , @xmath42 , for both models . to maximise the change",
    ", we assumed the models to have 90  obliquity so that an angular displacement , @xmath116 , along the heliocentric orbit will translate into a change in aspect angle @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the two models produce slightly different behaviour and future observations may help rule out one of the solutions .",
    "the jacobi and roche model solutions predict significantly different bulk densities for sq@xmath1 .",
    "the former is consistent with a density around 860 kg m@xmath7 which would indicate a predominantly icy interior and significant porosity .",
    "the roche binary model implies a density close to 2670 kg m@xmath7 , consistent with a rocky bulk composition .",
    "densities higher than 2000 kg m@xmath7 have only been measured for the larger kbos , eris @xcite , pluto @xcite , haumea @xcite and quaoar .",
    "densities for objects with diameters similar to sq@xmath1  tend to fall in the range @xmath118 kg m@xmath7 @xcite with the possible exception of ( 88611 ) teharonhiawako with @xmath119 kg m@xmath7 . if confirmed , the roche model density of sq@xmath1  would make it one of the highest density known kbos and the densest of its size .    in a scenario in which the haumea family was produced by a collision that ejected the volatile - rich mantle of the proto - haumea , its members would be expected to be mainly icy in composition , with high albedo surfaces . the jacobi model density for sq@xmath1  would favour such a scenario ( although the implied surface scattering is inconsistent with an icy , high albedo and high limb - darknening surface ) whereas the roche model density would be harder to explain in the context of the family .",
    "density @xmath120 kg m@xmath7 and water - ice spectrum implies a rocky core surrounded by a veneer of ice .",
    "if sq@xmath1has high - density and was produced from a collision onto haumea then it must be a fragment from the core material .",
    "broadband near - infrared photometry of sq@xmath1  suggests a surface rich in water ice .",
    "our measurements indicate a nearly solar mag @xcite ] surface colour @xmath4 mag and a steep ( although poorly constrained ) phase function with slope @xmath5 mag/@xmath6 .",
    "while the visible and infrared colours of sq@xmath1  match those of other members of the haumea family , the phase function is much steeper .",
    "the albedo of sq@xmath1  is unknown .",
    "although its surface is blue and possibly water - ice rich , these properties do not necessary imply high albedo .",
    "for instance , 2002@xmath0ms@xmath121 has blue colour but low albedo , and quaoar displays strong water - ice absorption @xcite despite its relatively dark and red surface .",
    "water ice has been spectroscopically detected on objects with albedos as low as 0.04 , e.g.  chariklo , and as high as 0.80 , e.g.  haumea @xcite .",
    "the shape models and density estimates presented above assume an idealised fluid object in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "as a limiting case , the simplification is useful because it offers a simple and unique relation between shape , spin period and bulk density .",
    "however , sq@xmath1  is a solid body and likely behaves differently .",
    "@xcite have studied extensively the equilibrium configurations of rotating solid bodies  sometimes termed `` rubble piles''that possess no tensile strength but that can retain shapes bracketing the hydrostatic solution due to pressure - induced , internal friction .",
    "similar studies were performed for roche figures of equilibrium by @xcite .",
    "the deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium solution is usually quantified in terms of an increasing angle of friction , @xmath122 . for a positive value of @xmath123 ,",
    "a range of bulk densities ( which includes the hydrostatic equilibrium solution ) is possible for an object with a given shape and spin rate .    for a plausible range of albedos , sq@xmath1",
    "has an equivalent diameter in the range @xmath124 km .",
    "the giant planet icy moons in the same size range ( amalthea at jupiter and mimas , phoebe and janus at saturn ; hyperion has chaotic rotation and is ignored ) lie at the threshold between near hydrostatic shapes and slightly more irregular configurations @xcite . when approximated by triaxial ellipsoids and plotted on the diagrams of @xcite , the shapes , spins and densities of these moons are consistent with angles of friction @xmath125 ( see also",
    "similar values of @xmath123 are found for most large , approximately triaxial asteroids @xcite .",
    "if we take our jacobi ellipsoid solution for sq@xmath1  and assume an angle of friction @xmath126 then we find that its density should lie in the range @xmath127 kg  m@xmath7 , i.e.  a 30% departure from the idealised hydrostatic equilibrium solution .",
    "a similar uncertainty applied to the roche binary density estimate yields a range @xmath128 kg  m@xmath7 .",
    "we present time - resolved photometric observations of kuiper belt object 2003@xmath0sq@xmath1  obtained in august and october 2011 to investigate its nature .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "sq@xmath1  exhibited a highly variable photometric lightcurve with a peak - to - peak range @xmath2 magnitudes and period @xmath3 hours .",
    "the object has an almost solar broadband colour @xmath4 mag , making it one of the bluest kbos known .",
    "the phase function of sq@xmath1  is well matched by a linear relation with intercept @xmath46 mag and slope @xmath45 mag/@xmath6 .",
    "this linear phase function is consistent with an earlier measurement obtained in 2008 at phase angle @xmath70 .",
    "the lightcurve implies that sq@xmath1  is highly elongated in shape . assuming that the object is in hydrostatic equilibrium , we find that the lightcurve of sq@xmath1  is best fit by a compact roche binary model with mass ratio @xmath129 , and triaxial primary and secondary components with axes ratios @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , separated by @xmath133 .",
    "the data are also adequately fitted by a highly elongated , jacobi triaxial ellipsoid model with axes ratios @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "observations in this decade may be able to rule out one of the two solutions .",
    "if sq@xmath1  is a roche binary then its bulk density is approximately 2670 kg @xmath7 .",
    "this model - dependent density implies rock - rich composition for this object .",
    "however , if sq@xmath1  is a jacobi ellipsoid we find a significantly lower density , @xmath136 kg m@xmath7 consistent with an icy , porous interior .",
    "these density estimates become uncertain at the 30% level if we relax the hydrostatic assumption and account for `` rubble pile''-type configurations .",
