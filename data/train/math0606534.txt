    "this notation relates to the standard sutured manifold notation as follows : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is a union of annuli and @xmath18 is a union of tori , while @xmath19 are , respectively , the outwardly and inwardly oriented portions of @xmath20 .",
    "the choice of orientations is part of the sutured structure and each component of @xmath21 is separated from a component of @xmath22 by annular components of @xmath23 . finally , each suture is a closed curve in the interior of a component of @xmath17 , parallel to and oriented with the boundary curves of this annulus .",
    "the union of the sutures is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "we will be interested in taut foliations of @xmath0 , hence will require that @xmath0 be irreducible and , as a sutured manifold , _",
    "taut_. this latter requirement means that each component of @xmath14 is norm - minimizing in @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath26 is an imbedded loop bounding a disk in @xmath0 , it also bounds a disk in @xmath14 .    in  @xcite , we proved the following analog of thurston s theorem ( theorem  [ thurston ] ) for depth one foliations .",
    "[ cones ] let @xmath27 be a compact , connected , oriented , irreducible , taut , sutured @xmath12manifold .",
    "there are finitely many closed , convex , polyhedral cones in @xmath28 , called _ foliation cones _ , having disjoint interiors and such that the taut , transversely oriented , depth one foliations of @xmath11 that are transverse to @xmath15 and have the components of @xmath14 as sole compact leaves correspond to the rays through integer lattice points of @xmath6 in the interior of the foliation cones .",
    "set @xmath29 and remark that a depth one foliation as above restricts to a fibration of @xmath30 over the circle .",
    "the classes in the interior of foliation cones that are not on rays through integer lattice points correspond to foliations `` almost without holonomy '' with each leaf in @xmath31 dense in @xmath0 .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the `` foliated ray '' @xmath32 corresponding to the depth one foliation @xmath33 determines @xmath33 up to a @xmath34 isotopy that is smooth in @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast to thurston s result , the cones in theorem  [ cones ] are generally not defined by a norm .",
    "indeed , they are not generally symmetric with respect to multiplication by @xmath35 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ cones ] in  @xcite had some serious gaps .",
    "the authors are preparing a revised version  @xcite of that paper that resolves these problems .",
    "there is a seminorm @xmath1 for sutured manifolds , called the _ sutured _ thurston norm .",
    "this is due to m.  scharlemann  @xcite and , if @xmath36 , @xmath1 reduces to the usual norm @xmath5 . in this note",
    "we develop ideas relating @xmath1 to the depth one foliations classified by theorem  [ cones ] and show how this theory can be used to compute the norm .",
    "this makes the computations of the norm , done in the examples at the end of  @xcite , rigorous . in those examples ,",
    "the foliation cones are unions of cones over some faces of the thurston ball of @xmath1 , but this fails in example  [ interesting ] of the present paper .",
    "however , even in this example , @xmath1 is closely enough related to the foliation cones that we are able to compute the thurston norm .",
    "there are three basic topics to be treated here , namely : the doubling map in singular homology , the thurston norm in sutured manifolds and their doubles , and the process of inducing fibrations in the double @xmath2 from certain depth one foliations on @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a smooth , connected , oriented , sutured manifold , we form the double @xmath2 along @xmath14 ( assumed to be nonempty ) .",
    "this is defined in complete analogy with the usual definition of the double of a manifold along its full boundary .",
    "thus @xmath2 is an oriented manifold formed by taking a second copy of @xmath0 , but with opposite orientation , and gluing the two together via the identity map on @xmath14 .",
    "we write @xmath37 there is a standard way to put a smooth , oriented structure on @xmath2 so that @xmath38 is also smooth and so that the natural reflection map @xmath39 is an orientation  reversing diffeomorphism .",

    "let @xmath41 be a smooth , properly imbedded , oriented surface .",
    "reversing orientations gives @xmath42 .",
    "the double @xmath43 can be viewed as an oriented , properly imbedded submanifold of @xmath2 .",

    "a smooth triangulation of @xmath48 determines a smooth triangulation of @xmath45 , producing singular cycles mod the boundary in @xmath0 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "the corresponding classes @xmath54\\in h_{2 } ( m,{\\partial}m)$ ] and @xmath55\\in h_{2 } ( dm,{\\partial}dm)$ ] are well defined , independently of the choice of triangulation .",

    "that is , each singular simplex in a chain @xmath76 is supported either in @xmath47 or in @xmath70 .",

    ", we define the thurston norm in a sutured manifold by doubling along @xmath15 , computing the thurston norm in the doubled manifold , and dividing by two .",

    "more precisely , let @xmath48 be properly imbedded as usual and connected . by a small isotopy , @xmath106 can be assumed to be transverse to @xmath107 and we compute @xmath108 by doubling along @xmath15 , computing the usual @xmath109 of the doubled surface and dividing by two .",
    "( the superscript s stands for `` sutured '' . )",
    "one can give an intrinsic formula for this number as follows .",
    "the components of @xmath110 are circles and/or properly imbedded arcs in annular components of @xmath15 .",
    "these circles need not be essential and some of the arcs might also fail to be essential in the sense that they start and end on the same boundary component of an annular component in @xmath15 .",
    "we will see that these inessential arcs and circles can be eliminated , but for the moment they are allowed .",
    "let @xmath111 denote the number of arc components of @xmath110 .",
    "then the reader can verify that the formula for @xmath112 is @xmath113 as usual , if @xmath48 is not connected , one defines @xmath108 as the sum of the values on each component .",
    "if @xmath114 is an element of the integer lattice in @xmath28 , @xmath115 is defined to be the minimum value of @xmath108 taken over all surfaces @xmath116 . continuing to follow thurston s lead ,",
    "we extend @xmath1 canonically to a pseudonorm on the vector space @xmath28 and call this the _ sutured _ thurston norm .    instead of computing the sutured norm by doubling in @xmath15",
    ", one can equally well double in @xmath14 .",
    "again the components of @xmath117 are properly imbedded arcs and/or circles and the number of arc components is the same number @xmath111 .",
    "one then notes that @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is defined as for the ordinary thurston norm .",
    "we further remark that , by a @xmath112reducing homology and/or isotopy , @xmath48 can be assumed to meet each annular component of @xmath15 only in essential arcs , each crossing the suture once , or in essential circles , each parallel to the suture and disjoint from it . it can be assumed also that @xmath48 meets each toral component only in essential circles , although this remark is not particularly consequential . at any rate ,",
    "@xmath111 is now just the number of times that @xmath106 crosses the sutures and it is elementary that this number is even .",
    "thus , @xmath108 is an integer , as is @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "a decomposing disk @xmath121 in the sense of gabai  @xcite has @xmath122 if it meets the sutures twice , @xmath123 if it meets them four times , etc .",
    "[ dbl ] the map @xmath56 is norm  doubling , where the sutured thurston norm is used on the first space and the usual thurston norm is used on the second .",
    "thus , if @xmath124 is the thurston ball of @xmath0 and @xmath125 that of @xmath2 , then @xmath126 .",
    "it is enough to prove this on elements of the integer lattice .",
    "let @xmath54 $ ] be represented by a @xmath112minimal surface @xmath48 .",
    "we have already noted that @xmath127 , hence it will be enough to show that @xmath45 is a @xmath109minimal representative of @xmath55=d_{*}[s]$ ] .",

    "if no component of @xmath133 has positive euler characteristic , one verifies the relation @xmath134 the only possible components with positive euler characteristic are spheres or disks . in the first case ,",
    "irreducibility of @xmath0 permits elimination of the offensive component .",
    "in the second , there will be no problem if the boundary of the disk @xmath121 meets @xmath14 in arcs . otherwise , @xmath135 is a simple closed loop either in @xmath15 or @xmath14 . in the first case , @xmath121 is also a component of @xmath130 in @xmath2 and has zero thurston norm . in @xmath0",
    "it has zero sutured norm , so this case also causes no problem . in the remaining case , @xmath136 and tautness of the sutured manifold structure , together with irreducibility , yields an isotopy of @xmath137 pulling the disk @xmath121 through @xmath14 , hence eliminating it as a component of @xmath133 .",

    "this insures that @xmath14 can not be a fiber in a fibration of @xmath2 over the circle .",
    "we sketch some facts that are treated in greater detail in  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",

    "the form @xmath97 defines @xmath148 , hence also determines @xmath33 , and its cohomology class can be viewed as a class on @xmath0 via the homotopy equivalence @xmath149 ( the natural inclusion map ) . for any positive constant @xmath150 ,",
    "the form @xmath151 also defines @xmath33 , so we obtain a `` foliated ray '' @xmath152 corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "this ray , in turn , determines @xmath33 up to an isotopy that is smooth in @xmath31 and continuous on @xmath0  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.1 ) .",
    "we often think of a foliated ray as an isotopy class of foliations .",

    "the leaves of @xmath148 spiral in a well  understood way on each component @xmath154 of @xmath14 , giving rise to a nondivisible cohomology class @xmath155 called the _ juncture _ of the spiral ( cf .",
    "the juncture on @xmath154 depends only on the class @xmath156  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3.1 ) .",
    "it can be represented by a compact , properly imbedded , oriented , nonseparating 1manifold @xmath157 which need not be connected  @xcite and each component is assigned an integer weight .",
    "if there is a depth one foliation @xmath158 such that @xmath159 , we will denote @xmath158 by @xmath160 and call this the _ opposite _ foliation to @xmath33 .",
    "remark that this is not the foliation defined by the form @xmath161 , even up to isotopy , since this foliation would require that the outwardly oriented components of @xmath14 become inwardly oriented and vice versa .",
    "these orientations are part of the given sutured structure on @xmath0 and may not be reversed . while , in many cases , @xmath160 exists , examples show that it may not .",
    "indeed , the three vertices in figure  [ ( 2,2,2)cones ] of section  [ exs ] are not foliated classes , but they are the negatives of foliated classes .",
    "of course , at the cohomology level , @xmath162=\\lambda ( -{\\mathcal{f}})$ ] . by the ideas in the proof of  ( * ? ? ? * lemma  3.1 ) , the juncture for @xmath160 can be represented by @xmath163 , the manifold obtained by reversing the orientation of @xmath164 . intuitively , the foliations @xmath165 spin in `` opposite directions '' along @xmath154 , appearing to be `` mirror images '' of one another in a small normal neighborhood of @xmath154 in @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath33 admits an opposite foliation @xmath160 .",
    "we can produce a taut foliation @xmath166 on @xmath2 by using @xmath33 in @xmath0 and @xmath160 in @xmath40 , the components of @xmath14 being the sole compact leaves .",
    "since the foliation is taut , each of the compact leaves is a properly imbedded , incompressible surface in @xmath167 .",
    "if @xmath154 is one of these compact leaves , it inherits an orientation so that it is inwardly oriented with respect to @xmath0 or @xmath40 and outwardly oriented with respect to the other .",
    "thus the junctures in @xmath154 for the respective foliations can be taken to be physically the same submanifold of @xmath154 , but with opposite orientations .",
    "it follows that the procedure in  @xcite applies , allowing us to erase these compact leaves by deleting their `` spiral ramp '' neighborhoods and fitting the resulting foliations together , matching convex corners of one to concave corners of the other and vice versa ( cf .",
    "* fig .  4 ) ) .",
    "actually , our situation is a bit more complicated than that envisioned in  @xcite because our juncture need not be connected , but essentially the same construction goes through . in this way",
    "we erase all leaves that are components of @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting foliation of @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath168 , has only compact leaves since the construction amputates the finitely many ends of all leaves and joins together their compact cores .",
    "thus , @xmath168 is a fibration of @xmath2 over the circle , the fibers being transverse to @xmath38 .",
    "the reader should be warned that @xmath168 is not uniquely determined by @xmath33 and @xmath160 .",
    "the topology of the fiber depends on the choices of spiral ramp neighborhoods of the components @xmath154 of @xmath14 . with a little care ,",
    "this construction can be carried out so that the following is true .",

    "while each component @xmath154 of @xmath14 fails to be a leaf of @xmath168 , it remains an incompressible surface in @xmath2 with a special relationship to @xmath168 .",

    "the tangent bundles @xmath170 and @xmath171 are both transverse to @xmath169 and transversely oriented so that both induce the same orientation along @xmath169 .",
    "it follows that @xmath172 are homotopic as oriented 2plane bundles , hence have the same ( relative ) euler class @xmath173 .",
    "thus @xmath174 we can assume , via a small isotopy near @xmath38 , that each component of @xmath175 is either transverse to @xmath168 or lies in a fiber of @xmath168 .",
