    "x^a = 12 [ x_r^(t+ ) - x_l^(t- ) ] .",
    "however , one of the most important arguments in the favor of the above combination of two chiral strings is suggested by the relation to the dirac equation , which must have a physical sense in the structure of the kerr spinning particle if it pretends on a classical description of the electron .",

    "both these examples are related to our case and the higgs field model for the stringy sources is used as the most simple and adequate to these cases .",
    "many physical stringy models as well as models of bags and domain walls are based on the different modifications of the higgs field model .",
    "almost all of the models leads to the picture of an extended physical object ( string , bag or other ) which is suited in the vacuum possessing superconducting properties .",
    "therefore , the infinite external space surrounding these objects turns out to be superconducting .",
    "although there is no usually the exact analytical solutions , the models turn out to be rather simple and solvable numerically .",
    "meanwhile , the main physical discrepancy is not discussed usually : the real surrounding vacuum is not superconducting !",
    "electromagnetic fields are freely propagating there , they are long range and do not acquire a mass from the higgs field as it follows from these models .",
    "the physically right picture ought to be turned over : the superconducting object is to be surrounded by a real vacuum with long range electromagnetic field .",
    "therefore , the considered usually models of extended objects describe the picture which is `` dual '' in some sense to the real physical situation meanwhile , in spite of this seeming failure , the use of these dual models is striking productive .",
    "the resolution of this contradiction lies in the assumption that there are two type of superconductivity , the usual `` true '' one and  dual \" or `` false '' one , and our observable `` true '' vacuum is not superconducting with respect to the usual electromagnetic field , @xmath128 gauge , but possesses a `` dual '' or `` false '' superconductivity with respect to some other @xmath129 gauge field which can be confined on the extended objects .    a model of this type , the @xmath130 field model ,",
    "was suggested by witten for the cosmic superconducting strings @xcite and represents a doubling of the usual abelian higgs model .",

    "this scalar field @xmath133 can be concentrated on the extended superconducting objects and describes the superconducting vacuum state .",
    "the sector @xmath132 of the model describes a `` dual '' picture .",
    "the nonzero chiral field @xmath134 covers almost all our space for the exclusion of the local regions occupied by superconducting objects , or for the exclusion of the regions of localization of the field @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , the localizations of the vacuums @xmath131 and @xmath132 are dual to each other .",
    "similarity of the sectors @xmath131 and @xmath132 allows one to consider field @xmath137 also as a carrier of some kind of superconductivity , but this is a `` false '' or `` dual '' superconductivity which covers almost all our empty space .",
    "therefore , our usual physical vacuum is considered as a `` dual '' superconductor in this model .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian of the witten @xmath138 field model is given by @xcite @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are field stress tensors , and the potential has the form @xmath142 two abelian gauge fields @xmath143 and @xmath144 interact separately with two complex scalar fields @xmath137 and @xmath133 so that the covariant derivative @xmath145 is associated with @xmath131 sector , and covariant derivative @xmath146 is associated with @xmath132 sector .",
    "field @xmath147 carries a @xmath129 charge @xmath148 and a @xmath128 charge @xmath149 , and field @xmath150 carries @xmath129 and @xmath128 charges of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively",
    ".    the a and b sectors are almost independent interacting only through the potential term for scalar fields .",

    "[ chi1 ] since the term @xmath165 has been already eaten by the term @xmath159 we have got for the massive u - component the equations a_u^(m ) = j_u^= e^2 ^2 a_u^(m ) .",
    "[ damu ] however , the mass term @xmath166 is not constant in our case , but is a function of @xmath69 which fall off outside the string core .",
    "it complicates the regularization procedure since the solution of this equation will represent an interpolation between some solution with mass at the string core and the massless solution in far zone .    to solve this equation we use the ansatz a_u^(m )",

    ".    therefore , from ( [ damu ] ) we obtain the equations e^f",
    "_ a_u^(0 ) = e ^2 e^f _ a_u^(0 ) .",
    "[ dfa0 ] it turns out that we can use a common function @xmath169 , or @xmath170 .    taking into account ( [ da0 ] ) we obtain from ( [ dfa0 ] ) the following differential equation f  + ( f)^2 - f/=8 e^2 ^2 .",
    "[ ddf ] assuming for the shape of superconducting condensate on the string the distribution ( ) = c e^-^2 , [ phi ] we obtain by numeric computations the following shape of the function @xmath171 , which is shown on the fig.4 .",
    "the resulting regularized u - component takes the form a_u = ( 1 -e^f ( ) ) a_u^(0 ) , [ autot ] and singularity cancels .",
    "as it is seen from the fig.4 , in the far zone the function @xmath172 will tend to some negative constant , and as the result the factor @xmath173 will partially suppress the solution outside the string core too .    for the other massive components the equations will retain the form ( [ dam ] ) , and from ( [ chi1 ] ) one obtains , _ = _ 0 ( , ) , _ - e 2i   a_u^(0 + ) , , _ = _ 0 ( , ) , _ + e 2i   a_u^(0- ) .",
    "[ dchi ] numerical computations allow us to obtain the behavior of the massive components @xmath174 and @xmath175 . the result of regularization is shown on the fig.5 .",
    "one sees that the used `` compensatory '' approach is really effective , and one can expect that it will also be effective for regularization of the kerr ringlike singularity and by the formation of the kerr s disklike source .",
    "the considered axial stringy system of the kerr spinning particle gives a new view on the physical sense of the dirac equation , and also maybe on the physical sense of the quantum wave function , divergences and regularization .",
    "it should be also noted a striking similarity of this structure with the well known elements and methods of the signal transmission in the systems of radio engineering and radar systems .",
    "in fact , the chiral axial string resembles a typical system for the signal transmission containing a carrier frequency which is modulated by a signal - the wave function which is the carrier of information .",
    "the kerr circular string also plays the role of a generator of the carrier frequency .",
    "basing on the principle that the fine description of a quantum system has to absorb maximally the known classical information on this system , one can conjecture that the above strikingly simple structure may have a relation to the structure of spinning particles . in this scheme",
    "the quantum wave function has a physical carrier .",
    "it should be mentioned that the considered topological coupling of the circular kerr string and the axial stringy system reproduces the very old de broglie s `` wave - pilot''idea on a singular carrier of the wave function which controls the dynamics of quantum particle .",
    "we have already mentioned , that the axial string tension tends to zero for a free particle , but it has to be finite for the bounded states when the axial string can form the closed loops .",
    "one can also expect that for the closed loops an extra tension can appear caused by the magnetic flows which can concentrate on these strings @xcite , and it has to be a question for further investigations .",
    "the role of the axial strings in the mass renormalization , as well as the gravitational ( pp - wave ) nature of the axial strings contain a hint that such closed loops of the strings may be candidates for gravitons .",
    "one can also assume that vacuum itself may be formed from the strings of this type .",
    "the existence of the axial stringy system in the kerr spinning particle allows us to overcome the old contradiction between the very small experimental value of the electron cross section and the very large compton size of the kerr source .",
    "one can conjecture now that the cross section of electron may be determined by the contact stringy interaction of the axial stringy system , acquiring also some corrections from the compton region of the kerr circular string .",
    "it seems that the axial stringy system may be observable in the experiments with scattering of the soft laser beams on the crossing beams of polarized electrons and maybe on the crossing laser beams too , and this may be crucial for verification the reality of this axial stringy system .",
