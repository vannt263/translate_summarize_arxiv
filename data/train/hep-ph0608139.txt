    "babar have recently announced the discovery of a new @xmath0 state seen in @xmath6 collisions decaying to @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , or @xmath10@xcite .",
    "the breit - wigner mass of the new state is    m(d_sj(2860 ) ) = 2856.6 1.5 5.0  mev and the width is ( d_sj(2860 ) ) = 48 7 10  mev .",
    "the signal has a significance greater than 5 @xmath11 in the @xmath12 channels and 2.8 @xmath11 in the @xmath13 channel .",
    "there is no evidence of the @xmath14 in the @xmath15 decay mode@xcite or the @xmath16 mode@xcite .",
    "there is , furthermore , structure in the @xmath17 channel near 2700 mev that yields breit - wigner parameters of    m(d_sj(2690 ) ) = 2688 4 2  mev and ( d_sj(2690 ) ) = 112 7 36  mev .",
    "the significance of the signal was not stated .",
    "the discovery of these states is particularly germane to the structure of the @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the low mass and isospin violating decay mode , @xmath19 , of the @xmath18 imply that the state could be a @xmath17 molecule@xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the @xmath20 could be a supernumerary scalar @xmath21 state .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath18 could be the ground state scalar @xmath21 state and the new @xmath22 s could be canonical radial excitations . clearly , constructing a viable global model of all the @xmath0 states",
    "is important to developing a solid understanding of this enigmatic sector@xcite .",
    "previous efforts to understand the new babar states have argued that the @xmath14 is a scalar @xmath23 state predicted at 2850 mev in a coupled channel model@xcite or that it is a @xmath24 @xmath23 state@xcite .",
    "here we pursue a simple model that assumes that all of the known @xmath0 states are dominated by simple @xmath21 quark content .",
    "it is known that this is difficult to achieve in the ` standard ' constituent quark model with @xmath25 spin - dependent mass shifts because the @xmath26 is much lighter than typical predictions ( for example , godfrey and isgur obtain a @xmath27 mass of 2480 mev@xcite ) .",
    "an essential feature in such phenomenology has been the assumption of two static potentials : a lorentz scalar confining potential and a short range coulombic vector potential .",
    "following the discovery of the @xmath18 , cahn and jackson@xcite analysed the @xmath0 states with a scalar potential @xmath28 , whose shape they allowed to be arbitrary , while retaining a vector potential @xmath29 that they assumed to be coulombic . in the limit that the mass @xmath30 this enabled the spin dependent potential applicable to p - states to take the form    @xmath31",
    "( see the discussion around eq . 1 of @xcite for details ) .",
    "for @xmath32 a reasonable description of the masses could be obtained though a consistent picture of @xmath33 spectroscopies and decays remained a problem . as the authors noted ,  the ansatz taken for the potentials @xmath29 and @xmath28 may not be as simple as assumed \" . the more general form @xcite is    @xmath34    only in the particular case of a coulomb potential",
    "need @xmath35@xcite . direct channel couplings ( such as to @xmath17 and @xmath15 thresholds@xcite ) will induce effective potentials that allow the above more general form .",
    "similarly , higher order gluon exchange effects in pqcd will also .",
    "indeed , the full spin - dependent structure expected at order @xmath36 in qcd has been computed@xcite and reveals that an additional spin - orbit contribution to the spin - dependent interaction exists when quark masses are not equal .",
    "when these are incorporated in a constituent quark model there can be significant mass shifts leading to a lowered mass for the @xmath27 consistent with the @xmath26@xcite . here",
    "we apply this model to the recently discovered @xmath0 states .",
    "predictions of the new model in the @xmath0 sector are summarised in table [ spectrumtab ] ( the ` high ' parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite are employed ) .",
    ".@xmath0 spectrum .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     estimating vector decay constant ratios as above yields @xmath37 . finally , predicted ratios of excited vector production are    @xmath38    and @xmath39 we note that eqn . [ vecrateq ] agrees well with the earlier prediction of close and swanson@xcite .",
    "given the controversial nature of the @xmath18 , establishing a consistent picture of the entire @xmath0 spectrum is very important .",
    "the new states claimed by babar can be useful in this regard .",
    "we have argued that the six known @xmath0 and two new states can be described in terms of a constituent quark model with novel spin - dependent interactions . predicted strong decay properties of these states appear to agree with experiment .",
    "perhaps the most important tasks at present are ( i ) discovering the @xmath40 state , ( ii ) searching for resonances in @xmath15 and @xmath41 up to 3100 mev , ( iii ) analysing the angular dependence of the @xmath17 final state in @xmath14 decay , ( iv ) assessing whether the @xmath20 appears in the @xmath15 channel , ( v ) searching for these states in @xmath42 with branching ratios of @xmath43 .",
    "subsequent to these calculations , and as this report was being completed , belle@xcite has reported a vector state whose mass , width , and possibly production rate and decay characteristics are consistent with our predictions .",
    "specifically , their measured mass and total width are @xmath44 mev and @xmath45 mev , in remarkable agreement with our predictions .",
    "the specific parameters we have used in our analysis are contained within their uncertainties .",
    "belle@xcite find the new state in @xmath5 decays , which we have proposed as a likely source .",
    "they report @xmath46 . when compared to the production of the ground state vector@xcite which is @xmath47 , the ratio of production rates in @xmath5 decay is then @xmath48 . from our table",
    "ii , and assuming flavor symmetry for the strong decay , we predict that @xmath49 , which within the uncertainties will apply also to the belle state",
    ". thus the absolute production rate , within the large uncertainties , appears to be consistent with that predicted in section 4 .",
    "if the central value of the belle mass is a true guide , then a significant branching ratio in @xmath15 would be expected ( table ii and fig 1 ) .",
    "the orthogonal vector state would then be dominantly 1d at 2.78 gev , but hard to produce in @xmath5 decays .",
    "these statements depend on the dynamics underlying @xmath50-@xmath51 mixing , which is poorly understood .",
    "it is therefore very useful that @xmath5 decay systematics and the strength of the @xmath15 decay channel in the excited vector @xmath0 mesons can probe this dynamics .",
