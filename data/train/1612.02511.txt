    "the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) is one of the intriguing puzzles in our understanding of the universe . in order to generate the bau ,",
    "three conditions , which have been pointed out by sakharov  @xcite , need to be satisfied in the early universe : baryon number ( @xmath3 ) violation , @xmath4/@xmath1 violation and departure from equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath3-violation is actually replaced by @xmath5-violation since the @xmath5-conserving and @xmath6-violating sphaleron process can easily transfer @xmath3 number into @xmath7 number and _ vice versa _ before the electroweak phase transition  @xcite .",
    "while several ideas have been proposed to produce bau by using @xmath3-violating interactions , leptogenesis provides a different mechanism for generating bau by using @xmath7-violating interactions  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , instead of a baryon asymmetry , a lepton asymmetry is generated in the early universe via @xmath7-violating interactions .",
    "once the net lepton number is generated , it is transferred into the baryon number via the sphaleron process .",
    "such scenarios are naturally realized in seesaw models for neutrino mass generation .",
    "the @xmath7-violating and @xmath4/@xmath1-violating interactions are introduced for majorana mass terms and their yukawa couplings of right - handed neutrinos ( rhns ) .",
    "one of the most beautiful scenarios is the thermal leptogenesis that produces lepton asymmetry from thermally produced rhns . the thermal plasma after reheating produces a number of rhns . when the produced rhns are out of equilibrium , they decay asymmetrically into leptons vs. anti - leptons and thus generate net lepton number .",
    "it has been known that in this case , a large reheating temperature @xmath8 gev is required to obtain enough baryon - number - to - entropy ratio @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) exists , however , one must take care of gravitino production for such a high reheating temperature  @xcite .",
    "the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism  @xcite is an attractive baryogenesis scenario in susy models that does not necessarily require high reheating temperature and hence the tension with gravitino production is circumvented.gev . ] in susy models , it is quite generic to have many flat directions , so the baryon asymmetry can be efficiently generated along such flat directions .",
    "in particular , if one considers the @xmath0 flat direction , whose non - renormalizable potential is generated by integrating out rhns , sufficient lepton asymmetry can be produced at relatively small reheat temperature . in this case , however , one difficulty arises . for the desired baryon asymmetry",
    ", the @xmath0 direction must be very flat during lepton number generation , which results in a hierarchically light neutrino  @xcite .",
    "while this is not excluded since currently there is no lower bound on the lightest neutrino mass , such a hierarchical structure of neutrino masses may not be natural from the viewpoint of model building .",
    "one reason for a hierarchically small neutrino mass in the ad mechanism stems from the fact that the rhn mass scale is responsible for both leptogenesis and neutrino mass generation .",
    "thus the flatness of the @xmath0 direction is directly related to the lightness of neutrino .",
    "one way to relax this constraint is to make the rhn mass dynamical .",
    "if the rhn mass scale is very large during lepton number generation but become small during the current universe , the lightest neutrino can have a rather large mass .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , such a dynamical rhn mass can be realized in a peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetric model to solve the strong cp problem  @xcite .",
    "if the rhns are charged under pq symmetry , their masses are generated by the pq symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "thus , the rhn mass is time - dependent and it is determined by the dynamics of the pq field . during inflation ,",
    "the hubble - induced susy breaking potential holds the pq field at the planck scale , and thus pq symmetry is broken at the planck scale .",
    "after inflation and lepton number generation , the hubble - induced susy breaking effect becomes as small as ordinary susy breaking contributions , so the pq field starts to oscillate and settles down at the current value of the pq breaking scale .",
    "the rhns also have planck scale masses from the inflation era to the lepton number generation era , and become lighter afterwards .",
    "therefore , it is possible to simultaneously accommodate very efficient ad leptogenesis when the pq scale is around planck scale and rather larger neutrino mass in the current universe .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the scenario of ad leptogenesis with a varying pq scale , and provide its concrete realization in the dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitsky ( dfsz ) type model  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the pq breaking scalar fields provide a solution to the strong cp problem , generate rhn masses and the superpotential @xmath2-term for the higgsino sector .",
    "in addition , the superpotential term responsible for the @xmath2-term plays an important role to maintain the generated lepton asymmetry during pq field oscillation . the isocurvature contribution from axion dark matter",
    "is naturally suppressed by the large pq scale during inflation .    in this case , one additional crucial feature resides in the pq field decay . as stated above ,",
    "once the hubble - induced susy breaking effect becomes comparable to the ordinary susy breaking terms , the pq breaking field , which is called saxion , starts to oscillate with respect to the current pq scale .",
    "the saxion dominates the universe right after the reheating process , so its decay produces large amount of entropy .",
    "hence the final baryon asymmetry is sensitive to the saxion decay , which depends on how the pq sector couples to the standard model particles . in the dfsz case ,",
    "the saxion decay is dependent on the @xmath2-term .",
    "therefore the resulting baryon asymmetry after saxion decay is linked to electroweak fine - tuning , which is determined by the @xmath2-term . in sec .",

    "moreover , it is good for the _ mixed axion - higgsino dark matter scenario _  @xcite .    before closing this section ,",
    "it is worth noting that the saxion decay temperature can be smaller than @xmath195 gev for small @xmath2 and large @xmath11 as indicated by red shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the region with @xmath196 gev may cause the saxion to decay after freeze - out of weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter and thus such late decay affects the wimp dark matter density due to entropy production and/or non - thermal dark matter production , although it is not possible to make a concrete analysis without a specific susy spectrum .",
    "moreover , for the region with @xmath197 gev , the saxion decays after coherent oscillation of axion commences , so it affects the axion dark matter density , too .",
    "in this section we discuss some cosmological implications related to the pq sector : axion isocurvature perturbation and axino production .",
    "there is a ( nearly ) massless goldstone boson from the spontaneous breakdown of the u(1)@xmath198 symmetry , the axion , which can also be interpreted as a massless majoron in our model  @xcite .",
    "such a massless boson potentially causes several cosmological problems  @xcite .    in our setup , the pq symmetry is already broken during inflation and is not restored thereafter .",
    "thus there is no axionic domain wall problem .",
    "the pq scalar @xmath16 obtains a large vev of @xmath126 in our setup , hence the pq scale during inflation is much higher than that in the present universe .",
    "it significantly suppresses the axion isocurvature perturbation  @xcite .",
    "since the massless axion mode almost consists of the phase component of @xmath16 for @xmath199 , the effective pq scale during inflation is simply given by @xmath200 . or @xmath15 has a larger field value than @xmath16 , the effective pq scale is given by @xmath201 or @xmath202  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case in our model . ]",
    "the magnitude of cdm isocurvature perturbation is then given by @xmath203 where @xmath204 denotes the hubble scale during inflation , @xmath205 denotes the initial misalignment angle of the axion and @xmath206 denotes the fraction of present axion energy density in the matter energy density : @xmath207 .",
    "the final axion density is given by  @xcite @xmath208 here we have assumed that there is no dilution of the axion density due to the saxion decay .",
    "the planck constraint on the uncorrelated isocurvature perturbation @xcite reads @xmath209 this constraint is easily satisfied for most inflation models since @xmath210 in our scenario .",
    "the axino is the fermionic superpartner of the axion , consisting of the fermionic components of @xmath16 and @xmath17 with a small mixture of higgsino .",
    "it obtains a mass of @xmath211 .",
    "it has a relatively long lifetime if it is not the lightest susy particle ( lsp )  @xcite .",
    "its decay width is approximately given by @xmath212 which is comparable to the saxion .",
    "thus the axino can have significant impacts on cosmology .",
    "the dominant axino production process is the thermal one .. ] the axino thermal production in the dfsz model comes from the combination of higgsino decay / inverse decay , scatterings of higgs and weak gauge bosons and also top / stop scatterings  @xcite .",
    "there it was found that the production is dominated at @xmath213 in general and the abundance is independent of the reheating temperature @xmath70 as long as @xmath214 .    in our case ,",
    "the saxion decay temperature @xmath215 can be lower than @xmath42 and hence there is a dilution of the preexisting axino abundance .",
    "first , let us consider the case @xmath216 .",
    "one of the main contributions may be the heavy higgs decay into the higgsino plus axino with the partial decay rate @xmath217 where the heavy higgs mass is assumed to be @xmath218 .",
    "the axino abundance is then estimated as @xmath219 in the opposite case @xmath220 , we must take the dilution factor into account . noting that @xmath221 during saxion domination , the resultant axino abundance is given by @xmath222 due to the dilution",
    ", the axino abundance can be suppressed .",
    "when the axino decays into lsp ( _ e.g. _ neutralinos ) , the lsp density is determined by its re - annihilation rate  @xcite , @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the axino decay temperature .",
    "thus the dark matter density from axino decay highly depends on details of the axino decay as well as upon its annihilation rate at @xmath224 .",
    "in this paper we have reconsidered the ad leptogenesis in a scenario where the rhn mass is dynamical .",
    "if the rhn mass is generated by the pq field , it naturally takes hierarchically different values between the early universe and the present epoch .",
    "in particular , the pq scalar can be stabilized at the planck scale in the early universe until the lepton asymmetry is generated , which makes leptogenesis much more efficient than in the ordinary scenario .",
    "the predicted lightest neutrino mass to reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry can be close to the neutrino mass differences known from the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "it significantly relaxes the problem of the ordinary ad leptogenesis scenario in which the lightest neutrino mass should be hierarchically smaller than the other two neutrinos .    in order to realize this scenario ,",
    "we have considered the dfsz model which provide a solution to the strong @xmath1 problem and generates the @xmath2-term and the rhn mass .",
    "since the final baryon asymmetry depends on the saxion decay , it is related to the @xmath2-term and to the electroweak fine - tuning . as a result ,",
    "a comparatively large mass of the lightest neutrino , @xmath225 ev , is predicted for @xmath193 gev@xmath194 gev and @xmath189 gev@xmath190 gev . in this model , therefore , it is possible to accommodate successful ad leptogenesis with a natural neutrino mass and natural electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , due to the very large pq scale during inflation , the axion isocurvature perturbation is suppressed .",

    "<S> we also show the pq breaking scalar dynamics that keeps a large pq breaking scale during inflation and lepton number generation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-term generating superpotential plays an important role for preserving the lepton asymmetry during saxion oscillation . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the axion isocurvature perturbation is naturally suppressed .    </S>",
