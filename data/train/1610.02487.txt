    "the study of subluminal and superluminal light propagation has been receiving a great deal of attention during the last couple of decades .",
    "this is mainly due to a number of impressive experiments that demonstrated both slow @xcite and fast light propagation @xcite in dispersive media .",
    "most studies of light propagation employ the standard electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) setup to control the group velocity of light pulses @xcite . in these schemes ,",
    "the absorption of light is very low while the dispersion has a steep positive slope leading to low values of the group velocity .",
    "the reduction of group velocity @xmath1 to less than the vacuum speed of light ( subluminal light propagation ) has been demonstrated both in atomic vapor @xcite and solid state materials @xcite . in the extreme case of ultraslow light propagation , light pulses",
    "can also be stopped @xmath2 @xcite and stored as demonstrated in many experiments @xcite . on the other hand , a light pulse can also travel with a group velocity exceeding the vacuum speed of light @xmath3 or even negative @xmath4 .",
    "such propagation of light pulses , termed as superluminal light propagation , occurs in anomalous dispersion media .",
    "it was pointed out that superluminal light propagation is not in conflict with causality or special relativity @xcite but a consequence of wave interference phenomena @xcite .",
    "the early work of steinberg and chiao suggested that an anomalous dispersion having a steep negative slope can appear between two closely spaced gain lines @xcite .",
    "based on the work of steinberg and chiao @xcite , wang _ et al .",
    "_ reported the first experimental demonstration of superluminal pulse propagation using the transparent anomalous dispersion in a raman gain doublet @xcite .",
    "there are also parallel developments in achieving both subluminal and superluminal light in atomic vapor @xcite and solid systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , some theoretical works showed the possibility of switching light propagation from subluminal to superluminal @xcite .",
    "_ demonstrated that the dispersion in @xmath5 systems can be manipulated by using an additional field coupling the metastable ground states @xcite .",
    "_ explained how the use of incoherent pump fields can influence the dispersion characteristics of the system @xcite .",
    "the group velocity control has been shown to be possible due to interaction of the atomic system with squeezed vacuum reservoirs @xcite .",
    "further , bortman - arbiv _ et al . _ reported that the relative phase between driving fields can control the dispersion in @xmath6 systems @xcite .    in this paper , we exploit the fact that decay processes can alter the absorption / dispersion of light propagation in a medium as a result of quantum interference in spontaneous decay channels .",
    "the interference occurs when two or more atomic transitions sharing common vacuum modes lead to a spontaneous emission of identical photons .",
    "an important result of such decay - induced interference is the generation of a coherence between the excited atomic states that are decaying to the common ground state @xcite .",
    "a variety of interesting features arising from the coupling of atomic transitions due to decay - induced interference has been reported @xcite .",
    "examples include phase control of group velocity @xcite , population trapping @xcite , fluorescence quenching @xcite , dark lines in emission spectrum @xcite , spontaneous emission cancellation @xcite , ultranarrow spectral lines in fluorescence @xcite , delayed formation of trapping state @xcite , gain in autler - townes doublet @xcite , phase control of collective dynamics @xcite , control of group velocity with squeezed reservoir @xcite , enhancement of two - photon absorption @xcite , splitting of resonances @xcite , enhancement of self - kerr nonlinearity @xcite , soliton formation @xcite , and enhanced spectral squeezing in fluorescence @xcite , etc .",

    "the atom has a y - type configuration in which two near - degenerate excited states decay via common vacuum modes to the middle state .",
    "the atom in the middle state can further undergo spontaneous transitions to the ground state .",
    "the cascade decays @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the excited atom give rise to an emission of identical pair of photons and hence quantum interference exists in emission pathways .",

    "further , we have also shown the possibility of refractive - index enhancement for the pump fields via decay - induced interference .",
    "it should be noted that the results predicted in this work are based on interference effects in spontaneous emission which require the existence of non - orthogonal dipole moments of the atomic transitions . in practice , it is difficult to meet this requirement in real atoms .",
    "several alternative schemes involving coherent- and dc - field - induced splitting of atomic levels @xcite , cavities with preselected polarisation @xcite , and decay in anisotropic vacuum @xcite have been proposed to realize interference effects surpassing the requirement of non - orthogonal dipole transitions . for a realistic example of the @xmath0-type configuration of energy levels",
