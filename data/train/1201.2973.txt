    "cool field brown dwarfs ( i.e. stellar - like objects with a mass below that required for the onset of hydrogen fusion , see e.g. hayashi & nakano 1963 , kumar 1963 , burrows & liebert 1993 ) are interesting for many reasons .",
    "they are important for studies of star formation and the initial mass function at low masses , as well as for studies of the chemistry and physics of cool atmospheres .",
    "furthermore , they can act as proxies for giant exoplanets which have similar temperatures and radii , but which have less well - understood interiors and which are harder to observe  brown dwarf science , for example , is directly applicable to the hr 8799 planets ( marois et al .",
    "the far - red sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , the near - infrared two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al .",
    "2007 ) led to the discovery of significant numbers of very low - mass and low - temperature stars and brown dwarfs in the field  the l and t dwarfs ( e.g. kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1997 , strauss et al .",
    "1999 , leggett et al .",
    "2000 , warren et al .",
    "the l dwarfs have effective temperatures ( @xmath10 ) of 1400  2200  k and the t dwarfs have @xmath11 1400  k ( e.g. stephens et al . 2009 ) .",
    "until very recently , the coolest brown dwarfs known were six t9 ",
    "t10 dwarfs with @xmath12600  k ( warren et al .",

    "these objects have masses of 10  20  @xmath9 ( e.g. leggett et al . 2010a",
    "; however here we determine a mass @xmath13  @xmath9 for one of these dwarfs , see  3 ) . in 2011",
    "two very faint companions were found that appear to have @xmath10 values between 300  k and 400  k ; one is a close companion to a t9.5 dwarf ( liu et al . 2011 ) , and the other a more distant companion to a white dwarf ( luhman , burgasser & bochanski 2011 ) .",
    "also , cushing et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have announced the discovery by the wide - field infrared survey explorer mission ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) of six isolated objects with extremely red [ 3.4]-[4.6 ] ( w1-w2 ) colors . followup near - infrared spectroscopy by the wise team shows that their near - infrared absorption bands are broader than for t9 dwarfs , the dwarfs increase dramatically in brightness from the near - infrared to the mid - infrared , and they appear to be intrinsically very faint at near - infrared wavelengths . for these reasons cushing et al .",
    "propose that five of these six new brown dwarfs be classified as y0 , with one dwarf being classified as even later .",
    "cushing et al .",
    "estimate temperatures of @xmath14 300  k to 450  k for the six dwarfs , by fitting synthetic spectra to the near - infrared spectra ( but see  3.1 ) . assuming an age range of 1  10 gyr , these isolated solar neighbourhood objects have masses in the range 5  20  @xmath9 .",
    "significant chemical changes occur in a brown dwarf atmosphere as it cools ( e.g. kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 ; lodders 1999 ; geballe et al . 2002 ; knapp et al . 2004 ; cushing et al . 2006 , 2011 ) .",
    "cloud decks of liquid and solid iron and silicate grains exist in the photospheres of l dwarfs , and their grain - reddened spectral energy distributions show strong metal hydride and neutral alkali lines , as well as h@xmath15o , co and , in the mid - infrared , ch@xmath16 bands .",
    "the t dwarf photospheres are too cool for iron and silicate grains , which condense in deeper layers of the atmosphere and have little to no role in forming the spectrum emitted by the photosphere .",
    "note , however , that in the atmospheres of late - type t dwarfs , the alkalis start condensing into salts and @xmath17 solids (  4.1 ) , and burgasser et al .",
    "( 2011 ) find that condensate clouds may be required to reproduce the near - infrared spectra of young , low gravity , t dwarfs .",
    "the predominantly clear t dwarf photospheres have optical flux distributions shaped by the red wing of the strong k i doublet at 770  nm , while their near- and mid - infrared spectra are sculpted by strong bands of h@xmath15o , ch@xmath16 and , in the mid - infrared , nh@xmath18 . recently ,",
    "bochanski et al . (",
    "2011 ) have shown that nh@xmath18 is also detectable in high - resolution near - infrared spectra of the @xmath19500  k very late - type t dwarf ugps j072227.51@xmath7054031.2 ( hereafter ugps 0722@xmath705 , lucas et al . 2010 ) . at the low temperatures of t dwarf photospheres",
    ", alkalis are turning into chloride gases and the neutral alkalis are starting to disappear . at even lower temperatures , alkali chloride gases",
    "condense out as salts . for details on alkali chemistry",
    "see lodders ( 1999 ) .    for a @xmath191000",
    "k t7 brown dwarf we expect that : the refractory elements mg , al , ca and ti will all have been removed from the photosphere ; carbon will be primarily in the form of ch@xmath16 ; nitrogen will be primarily in the form of n@xmath15 ; and the cs , k , na and rb neutral alkalis will be disappearing from the photosphere as they turn into chloride gases . for t8 ",
    "t10 dwarfs with @xmath20  k @xmath21 , we expect that nitrogen will be primarily in the form of nh@xmath18 ( depending on atmospheric mixing , see  3.5 ) and the neutral alkali lines will be weak .",
    "this interpretation is over - simplified however , because the background opacity ( the pseudo - continuum ) must be accounted for , and the temperature where the feature is formed can be very different from the @xmath10 value .",
    "the red spectral region of a brown dwarf contains strong absorption lines of cs , k , na and rb , and is the best region for studying the evolution of the alkali features with decreasing @xmath10 ( e.g. burgasser et al .",
    "a brown dwarf atmosphere is quite transparent in the far - red , meaning that the emergent flux is formed in a relatively hot zone where neutral alkalis can still exist .",
    "understanding the alkali chemistry of brown dwarfs is not only of intrinsic interest , it is important for modelling their red colors for the interpretation of sky surveys , see the discussion in marley et al . ( 2002 ) .",
    "sky surveys sensitive to the red or far - red colors of brown dwarfs include : the cfht brown dwarf survey ( delorme et al . 2008 ) , the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al . 2007 ) , pan - starrs ( kaiser 2004 ) , the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ; emerson 2001 ) , and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; ivezic et al . 2011 ) .",
    "getting the alkali chemistry right is also critical for understanding exoplanets .",
    "when planets are imaged in reflected light , alkalis can shape the spectra of the warmer planets that do not have water clouds or other hazes .",
    "some irradiated planets are modelled to have strong na and k features ( sudarsky et al .",
    "2000 , cahoy et al . 2010 ) , and na and k absorption has been detected in the spectra of extrasolar planet atmospheres ( e.g. charbonneau et al .",

    "in  2 of this paper we present new optical spectra for two brown dwarfs with @xmath22  k and 750  k , as well as new @xmath23 photometry for a sample of t dwarfs .",
    "we present additional data for the 500  k dwarf ugps 0722@xmath705 : a 2.8  4.2  @xmath6 m spectrum and improved astrometry .",

    "also in  4 , we compare the far - red to near - infrared colors of the latest - type t dwarfs to the saumon & marley models .",
    "for objects not much cooler than ugps 0722@xmath705 we can expect to see pronounced changes in the optical colors of the coolest brown dwarfs , as larger fractions of the alkalis are converted into chloride gases and condensation of alkali chloride salts begins . finally , in  5 , we present trends in @xmath24 with spectral type , and discuss the detectability of cold brown dwarfs by far - red / near - infrared ground - based surveys .",

    "we find that the synthesized sdss- and gmos - system values differ from the measured values by 10  20% , which can be accounted for by small discrepancies in the red cut - offs of the filters .",
    "the gmos north and south systems are very similar  the filters are designed to be identical , but the e2v detector responses are slightly different ( see figure 1 ) . because of the difficulty in synthesizing the photometry , we use the repeat measurements of three brown dwarfs to determine the offset between the two systems .",
