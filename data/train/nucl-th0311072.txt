    "next - generation double - beta - decay experiments will provide data on the mass of the lightest neutrino @xcite .",
    "but to interpret the data accurately we will need to better understand the nuclear physics that influences the decay rate .",
    "the problem of calculating double - beta - decay matrix elements has occupied nuclear theorists for a long time .",
    "the latest in a long history of neutrinoless - decay calculations are thought to approximate exact results to within factors of 3 or 4 , but that estimate is not much more than an informed guess . in short ,",
    "the calculations need to be improved .",
    "almost all current calculations are performed either in the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) or the shell model .",
    "the two methods differ in the types of correlations they take into account .",
    "the qrpa can include the cumulative effects of small numbers of particles or holes far above or below the fermi surface , but the correlations are of a specific type .",
    "the shell model is restricted to configurations with low excitation , but correlates them in all possible ways .",
    "the qrpa calculations indicate that nearly empty orbits relatively far from the fermi surface play a significant role in the nuclear ground states , implying that the shell - model is leaving something out .",
    "we are not referring here to the short - range correlations coming from the nucleon hard core , the representation of which requires very high - lying excitations .",
    "qrpa correlations are longer range , connected to orbits just 10 or 20 mev away from the fermi surface ; the shell model usually can not include even these . within the levels",
    "it does include , however , the shell model indicates that qrpa correlations are too simple .",
    "we need either to add the effects of more complicated correlations to the qrpa or to include effects of additional single - particle levels in the shell model ( or perhaps do both ) .",
    "the way to correct for the finite shell - model space is to construct effective hamiltonians and transition operators .",
    "unfortunately , the equations that determine effective operators are hard to solve and perturbative approximations often do not work .",
    "phenomenology is the usual substitute .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonians computed within perturbation theory usually include only two - body terms that are then renormalized to fit ground - state energies and other observables .",
    "effective transition operators are often taken to have the same form as the bare operators but are multiplied by effective coupling constants .",
    "such prescriptions can work well when there are lots of data to which parameters can be fit , but for the two - body operator governing neutrinoless double - beta decay , which has not yet been observed at all , the use of the bare operator with or without simple multiplicative renormalization is suspect .",
    "yet such is the state of the art in shell - model calculations of double - beta decay . to improve these calculations ,",
    "we should focus on a better determination of the effective decay operator .    here",
    "we use a solvable model based on the algebra @xmath0 to test some of the assumptions that go into calculations of double - beta decay in @xmath1ge , one of the most promising isotopes for experiment .",
    "we diagonalize the model hamiltonian and calculate the rates of both two - neutrino ( @xmath2 ) and neutrinoless ( @xmath3 ) decay in a space consisting of a degenerate @xmath4 valence shell , and a higher - energy degenerate @xmath5 shell . in this quite realistic model space ( albeit with unrealistically simple correlations )",
    ", we can compare the behavior of the two kinds of decays , which depend differently on radial wave functions , as we vary couplings in the hamiltonian .",
    "we can also project the full wave function onto states in which all nucleons are in the lower shell and test procedures for constructing effective interactions and operators .",
    "though technically we are calculating fermi decay , we allow isospin to be violated so that our calculation mimics many of the aspects of gamow - teller decay .",
    "we find , for example , that an effective two - body operator that reproduces decay rates exactly in nuclei with just a few valence nucleons , while better than the bare operator , is far from perfect when applied to a nucleus like @xmath1ge that has many valence particles .",
    "the more phenomenological prescription of multiplying the bare operator by an effective coupling requires different renormalization factors for @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay .",
    "such results , while perhaps unsurprising , contradict common practice .",
    "we also examine some related ideas .",
    "a recently proposed technique for constructing effective operators nonperturbatively through a lanczos approximation to the many - body green s function usually proves efficient but appears to offer little advantage over the lanczos methods already used in shell - model calculations for double - beta decay . a recent proposal for adjusting the hamiltonian in the qrpa to fit measured @xmath2 decay ,",
    "though it eliminates the dependence on some of the parameters in the hamiltonian and reduces the dependence on model - space size , does not work as well in this model as in more realistic calculations .",
    "the qrpa itself , ironically , reproduces exact solutions extremely accurately here .",
    "the rest of this paper is divided as follows : in section [ s:2 ] we discuss the model . though it has been used before in @xmath2 decay @xcite , ours is the first application to @xmath3 decay , the operator for which is not built from so(5 ) generators and therefore takes some effort to manipulate .",

    "one can then invert the relation between @xmath160 and @xmath78 and express @xmath137 directly in terms of @xmath160 .",

    "it turned out that the effects of single - particle levels far away from the fermi surface , while noticeable for @xmath137 and @xmath160 considered separately , became negligible when @xmath137 was plotted against @xmath160 .",
    "in other words , knowing @xmath160 ( from experiment ) one could obtain the unknown @xmath137 , and its value was the same whether the far away single - particle states were included or not in the qrpa , as long as at least two oscillator shells ( more than in our small space ) were included .",

    "the magnitude of the level splitting @xmath6 used here is unrealistically small . using larger @xmath6 moves the large - space lines closer to those of the small space .",
    "also , the interaction here affects only the @xmath155 multipole , while in realistic calculations all multipoles are affected to some degree . in any event , even with its shortcomings the procedure is interesting enough here that we find @xmath172 independently of the values of both @xmath78 and @xmath77 , with @xmath62 decreasing as the level splitting increases .",
    "combined with the accuracy of the qrpa in our model , this implies that the procedure gives a lower limit for the exact value of @xmath137 provided that the hamiltonian is corrected to reproduce the exact value of @xmath160 .",
    "our most important findings are that 1 ) calculated @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay rates are affected differently by model - space truncation , 2 ) familiar procedures for finding effective two - body decay operators to correct for truncation help matters but leave substantial room for improvement , and 3 ) the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite for eliminating model - space dependence in the qrpa helps but does nt work as well in our model as in realistic calculations .",
    "several issues still need to be investigated .",
    "how accurate are the qrpa results of ref .",
    "@xcite once the renormalization procedure is applied ?",
    "ironically , although the qrpa itself is very accurate in our model , almost certainly more accurate than in reality because the model has very collective modes ( the pairs ) , the renormalization procedure leaves more residual model - space dependence here than in realistic calculations .",
    "we therefore ca nt really address the question in our model .",
    "another issue we havent addressed is the effects of very - high momentum states on double - beta - decay operators .",
    "such effects are usually simulated by the short - range - correlation function @xmath173 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : src ] ) , but it s not clear how accurate a result is achieved that way .",
    "we are currently examining two - body short - range correlations by summing ladder diagrams similar to those that make up the brueckner g - matrix .",
    "properly treating more - body effects will be harder , both for short - range correlations and the longer - range correlations we investigated here . finding a good approximation scheme to incorporate them into shell model calculations is , in our view , the most important problem in the theoretical treatment of double - beta decay . because only the ground states need to be calculated , much of conventional effective - operator theory is superfluous and the biggest payoff may come from pushing lanczos - diagonalization methods to the largest model spaces possible , leaving only high - momentum correlations to be absorbed into operators .",
    "here we supplement eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d2 ] ) and ( [ eq : d0 ] ) with relations necessary to evaluate matrix elements of charge - changing two - body operators between states of the form @xmath41 , corresponding to particles in both sets of levels .",
