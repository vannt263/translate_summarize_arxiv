    "theoretical and experimental investigation of pulse wave propagation in human arteries has a long history .",
    "recently the research on blood flow has intensified because the fast development of methods for studying nonlinear systems @xcite-@xcite allowed to the researchers to achieve great progress in understanding nonlinear waves in fluid - solid structures , such as blood - filled human arteries . over the past decade , however , the scientific efforts have been concentrated on theoretical investigations of nonlinear wave propagation in arteries with a variable radius through the blood .",
    "clearing how local imperfections appeared in an artery can disturb the blood flow can help in predicting the nature and main features of various cardiovascular diseases , such as stenoses and aneurysms . in order to examine propagation of nonlinear waves in a stenosed artery , tay and co - authors treated the artery as a homogeneous , isotropic and thin - walled elastic tube with an axially symmetric stenosis .",
    "the blood was modeled as an incompressible inviscid fluid @xcite , newtonian fluid with constant viscosity @xcite , and newtonian fluid with variable viscosity @xcite . using a specific perturbation method , in a long - wave approximation the authors obtained the forced korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation with variable coefficients @xcite , forced perturbed kdv equation with variable coefficients @xcite , and",
    "forced korteweg - de vries  burgers ( kdvb ) equation with variable coefficients as evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the same theoretical frame was used in @xcite , @xcite to examine nonlinear wave propagation in an artery with a variable radius . considering the artery as a long inhomogeneous prestretched thin elastic tube with an imperfection ( presented at large by an unspecified function @xmath0 ) , and the blood as an incompressible inviscid fluid the authors reached again the forced kdv equation with variable coefficients . apart from solitary propagation waves in such a system , in @xcite , possibility of periodic waves",
    "was discussed at appropriate initial conditions . in the present work",
    "we shall focus on consideration of the blood flow through an artery with a local dilatation ( an aneurysm ) .",
    "the aneurysm is a localized , blood - filled balloon - like bulge in the wall of a blood vessel @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "its rupture causes massive bleeding with associated high mortality .",
    "motivated by investigations in @xcite@xcite , the main goal of this paper is to investigate effects of the aneurismal geometry and the blood characteristics on the propagation of nonlinear waves through an injured artery . for that purpose",
    ", we use a reductive perturbation method to obtain the nonlinear evolution equation .",
    "exact solution of this equation is obtained by using the modified method of simplest equation .",
    "recently , this method has been widely used to obtain general and particular solutions of economic , biological and physical models , represented by partial differential equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief description about the derivation of equations governing the blood flow trough a dilated artery is presented in sec .",
    "2 . in sec .",
    "3 we derive a basic evolution equation in long - wave approximation .",
    "a travelling wave solution of this equation is obtained in sec .",
    "numerical simulations of the solution are presented in sec .",
    "the main conclusions based on the obtained results are summarized in sec .",
    "6 of the paper .",
    "in order to derive the model of a blood - filled artery with an aneurysm we have to consider two types equations which represent ( i ) the motion of the arterial wall and ( ii ) the motion of the blood . to model such a medium we shall treat the artery as a thin - walled incompressible prestretched hyperelastic tube with a localized axially symmetric dilatation .",
    "we shall assume the blood to be an incompressible viscous fluid . a brief formulation of the above  mentioned equations follows in the next two subsections .",
    "it is well - known , that for a healthy human , the systolic pressure is about 120 mm hg and the diastolic pressure is 80 mm hg .",
    "thus , the arteries are initially subjected to a mean pressure , which is about 100 mm hg . moreover",
    ", the elastic arteries are initially prestretched in an axial direction .",
    "this feature minimizes its axial deformations during the pressure cycle .",
    "for example , experimental studies declare that the longitudinal motion of arteries is very small @xcite , and it is due mainly to strong vascular tethering and partly to the predominantly circumferential orientation of the elastin and collagen fibers .",
    "taking into account these observations , and following the methodology applied in @xcite@xcite , we consider the artery as a circularly cylindrical tube with radius @xmath1 , assuming that such a tube is subjected to an initial axial stretch @xmath2 and a uniform inner pressure @xmath3 . under the action of such a variable pressure",
    "the position vector of a generic point on the tube can be described by @xmath4\\mathbf{e_{r}}+z^*\\mathbf{e_{z}},\\    z^*=\\lambda_{z}z^*\\ ] ] + where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the unit basic vectors in the cylindrical polar coordinates , @xmath7 is the deformed radius at the origin of the coordinate system , @xmath8 is axial coordinate before the deformation , @xmath9 is the axial coordinate after static deformation and @xmath10 is a function describing the dilatation geometry .",
    "we shall specify the concrete form of @xmath10 later . upon the initial static deformation",
    ", we shall superimpose only a dynamical radial displacement @xmath11 , neglecting the contribution of axial displacement because of the experimental observations , given above .",
    "then , the position vector @xmath12 of a generic point on the tube can be expressed by @xmath13\\mathbf{e_{r}}+z^*\\mathbf{e_{z}}\\ ] ] the arc - lengths along meridional and circumferential curves respectively , are : @xmath14^{1/2}dz^*,\\   ds_{\\theta}=[r_{0}+f^*+u^*]d{\\theta}\\ ] ] in this way , the stretch ratios in the longitudinal and circumferential directions in final configuration are presented by @xmath15 where @xmath16^{1/2}\\ ] ] the notation @xmath17  denotes the differentiation of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath9 . then , the unit tangent vector @xmath19 along the deformed meridional curve and the unit exterior normal vector @xmath20 to the deformed tube are expressed by @xmath21 according to the assumption made about material incompressibility the following restriction holds : @xmath22 + where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the wall thicknesses before and after deformation , respectively .",
    "in addition , for hyperelastic materials , the tensions in longitudinal and circumferential directions take the form : @xmath25 + where @xmath26 is the strain energy density function of wall material as @xmath27 is the material shear modulus .",
    "although the elastic properties of an injured wall section differ from those of the healthy part , here , we assume that the wall is homogeneous , i.e. @xmath27 is a constant through the axis @xmath28 . finally , according to the second newton s law , the equation of radial motion of a small tube element placed between the planes @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 obtains the form : @xmath33 + where @xmath34 is the fluid reaction force , which shall be specified later , and @xmath35 is the mass density of the tube material .",
    "experimental studies over many years demonstrated that blood behaves as an incompressible non - newtonian fluid because it consists of a suspension of cell formed elements in a liquid well - known as blood plasma .",
    "however , in the larger arteries ( with a vessel radius larger than 1 mm ) it is plausible to assume that the blood has an approximately constant viscosity , because the vessel diameters are essentially larger than the individual cell diameters .",
    "thus , in such vessels the non - newtonian behavior becomes insignificant and the blood can be considered as a newtonian fluid . here , for our convenience we assume a ` hydraulic approximation ' and",
    "apply an averaging procedure with respect to the cross - sectional area to the navier  stokes equations .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath36 @xmath37 + where @xmath38 denotes the inner cross - sectional area , i.e. , @xmath39 as @xmath40 is the final radius of the tube after deformation .",
    "substituting @xmath38 into eq ( [ eq10 ] ) leads to @xmath41+[r_{0}+f^*(z^*)+u^*]\\frac{\\partial{\\omega^*}}{\\partial{z^*}}=0\\ ] ] we introduce the following non - dimensional quantities @xmath42 and replace them into eqs ( [ eq12 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , respectively .",

    "in this section we shall use the long  wave approximation to employ the reductive perturbation method @xcite for studying the propagation of small - but - finite amplitude waves in a fluid - solid structure system , presented by eqs ( [ eq13])([eq15 ] ) . in the long - wave limit",
    ", it is assumed that the variation of radius along the axial coordinate is small compared with the wave length . because this condition is valid for large arteries ,",
    "next we shall treat the problem as boundary value problem .",
    "we linearize eqs ( [ eq13])([eq15 ] ) , and search for their harmonic kind solution .",
    "next , according to the obtained dispersion equation it will be appropriate to introduce the following type of stretched coordinates @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a small parameter measuring the weakness of nonlinearity , dispersion and dissipation , and and @xmath49 is a scale parameter which will be determined from the solution",
    ". then , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 are functions of the variables @xmath54 and the small parameter @xmath48 .",
    "taking into account the effect of dilatation , we assume @xmath55 to be of order of 5/2 , i.e. @xmath56 in addition , taking into account the effect of viscosity , the order of viscosity is assumed to be @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 the last assumption ensures balance of nonlinearity , dispersion and dissipation in the system .",
