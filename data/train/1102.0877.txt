    "in this paper , we scrutinize the longtime behavior of a nonlinear evolution problem describing the damped oscillations of an extensible elastic bridge of unitary natural length suspended by means of flexible and elastic cables .",
    "the model equation ruling its dynamics can be derived from the standard modeling procedure , which relies on the basic assumptions of continuous distribution of the stays stiffness along the girder and of the dominant truss behavior of the bridge ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in the pioneer papers by mckenna and coworkers ( see @xcite ) , the dynamics of a suspension bridge is given by the well known damped equation @xmath4 where @xmath5\\times\\r\\to\\r$ ] , accounts for the downward deflection of the bridge in the vertical plane , and @xmath6 stands for its positive part , namely , @xmath7 our model is derived here by taking into account the midplane stretching of the road bed due to its elongation . as a consequence a geometric nonlinearity appears into the bending equation .",
    "this is achieved by combining the pioneering ideas of woinowsky - krieger on the extensible elastic beam @xcite with equation . setting for simplicity all the positive structural constants of the bridge equal to 1",
    ", we have @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ( given ) vertical dead load distribution . the term @xmath10 models a restoring force due to the cables , which is different from zero only when they are being stretched , and @xmath11 accounts for an external resistant force linearly depending on the velocity .",
    "the real constant @xmath2 represents the axial force acting at the ends of the road bed of the bridge in the reference configuration .",
    "namely , @xmath2 is negative when the bridge is stretched , positive when compressed .    as usual , @xmath12 and @xmath11",
    "are required to satisfy initial conditions as follows @xmath13,\\\\ \\pt u(x,0)={u}_1(x ) , & x\\in[0,1 ] .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] concerning the boundary conditions , we consider here the case when both ends of the bridge are pinned .",
    "namely , for every @xmath14 , we assume @xmath15 this is the simpler choice",
    ". however , other types of boundary conditions with fixed ends are consistent with the extensibility assumption as well ; for instance , when both ends are clamped , or when one end is clamped and the other one is pinned .",
    "we address the reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "assuming , the domain of the differential operator @xmath16 acting on @xmath17 is @xmath18 this operator is strictly positive selfadjoint with compact inverse , and its discrete spectrum is given by @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "besides , the peculiar relation    @xmath22 holds true , with dirichlet boundary conditions and @xmath23 hence , if pinned ends are considered , the initial - boundary value problem  can be described by means of a single operator @xmath24 , which enters the equation at the powers 1 and 1/2 .",
    "namely , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the norm of @xmath27 .",
    "this fact is particularly relevant in the analysis of the _ critical buckling load _ @xmath28 , that is , the magnitude of the compressive axial force @xmath29 at which buckled stationary states appear .",
    "as we shall show throughout the paper , this model leads to exact results which are rather simple to prove and , however , are capable of capturing the main behavioral dynamic characteristics of the bridge .      in recent years , an increasing attention was payed to the analysis of buckling , vibrations and post - buckling dynamics of nonlinear beam models , especially in connection with industrial applications @xcite and suspension bridges @xcite . as far as we know , most of the papers in the literature deal with approximations and numerical simulations , and only few works are able to derive exact solutions , at least under stationary conditions ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in the sequel",
    ", we give a brief sketch of earlier contributions on this subject .    in the fifties ,",
    "woinowsky - krieger @xcite proposed to modify the theory of the dynamic euler - bernoulli beam , assuming a nonlinear dependence of the axial strain on the deformation gradient .",
    "the resulting motion equation , @xmath30 has been considered for hinged ends in the papers @xcite , with particular reference to well - posedness results and to the analysis of the complex structure of equilibria .",
    "adding an external viscous damping term @xmath31 to the original conservative model , it becomes @xmath32 stability properties of the unbuckled ( trivial ) and the buckled stationary states of have been established in @xcite and , more formally , in @xcite . in particular , if @xmath33 , the exponential decay of solutions to the trivial equilibrium state has been shown .",
    "the global dynamics of solutions for a general @xmath2 has been first tackled in @xcite and improved in @xcite , where the existence of a global attractor for subject to hinged ends was proved relying on the construction of a suitable lyapunov functional . in @xcite",
    "previous results are extended to a more general form of the nonlinear term by virtue of a suitable decomposition of the semigroup first introduced in @xcite .",
    "a different class of problems arises in the study of vibrations of a suspension bridge .",
    "the dynamic response of suspension bridges is usually analyzed by linearizing the equations of motion .",
    "when the effects of extensibility of the girder are neglected and the coupling with the main cable motion is disregarded , we obtain the well - known lazer - mckenna equation .",
    "free and forced vibrations in models of this type , both with constant and non constant load , have been scrutinized in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the existence of strong solutions and global attractors for has been recently obtained in @xcite .    in certain cases",
    "lazer - mckenna s model becomes inadequate and the effects of extensibility of the girder have to be taken into account .",
    "this can be done by introducing into the model equation a geometric nonlinear term like that appearing in .",
    "such a term is of some importance in the modeling of cable - stayed bridges ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , where the elastic suspending cables are not vertical and produce a well - defined axial compression on the road bed .",
    "several studies have been devoted to the nonlinear vibrational analysis of mechanical models close to .",
    "abdel - ghaffar and rubin @xcite presented a general theory and analysis of the nonlinear free coupled vertical - torsional vibrations of suspension bridges .",
    "they developed approximate solutions by using the method of multiple scales via a perturbation technique .",
    "if torsional vibrations are ignored , their model reduces to .",
    "exact solutions to this problem , at least under stationary conditions , have been recently exhibited in @xcite .      in the next section 2 ,",
    "we formulate an abstract version of the problem .",
    "we observe that its solutions are generated by a solution operator @xmath34 , which turns out to be a strongly continuous semigroup in the autonomous case .",
    "the existence of an absorbing set for the solution operator @xmath34 is proved in section 3 by virtue of a gronwall - type lemma .",
    "section 4 is focused on the autonomous case and contains our main result .",
    "namely , we establish the _ existence of the regular global attractor _ for a general @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we prove this by appealing to the existence of a lyapunov functional and without requiring any assumption on the strength of the dissipation term .",
    "a characterization of the global attractor is given in terms of the steady states of the system . first , we proceed with some preliminary estimates and prove the exponential stability of the system provided that the axial force @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "finally , the smoothing property of the semigroup generated by the abstract problem is stated via a suitable decomposition first devised in @xcite .",
    "in the sequel we recast problem  - into an abstract setting in order to establish more general results .",
    "let @xmath36 be a real hilbert space , and let @xmath37 be a strictly positive selfadjoint operator with compact inverse .",
    "for @xmath38 , we introduce the scale of hilbert spaces generated by the powers of @xmath39 @xmath40 when @xmath41 , the index @xmath42 is omitted . the symbol @xmath43",
    "will also be used to denote the duality product between @xmath44 and its dual space @xmath45 . in particular",
    ", we have the compact embeddings @xmath46 , along with the generalized poincar inequalities @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the first eigenvalue of @xmath39 .",
    "finally , we define the product hilbert spaces @xmath49 for @xmath50 , we consider the following abstract cauchy problem on @xmath51 in the unknown variable @xmath52 , @xmath53 problem  - is just a particular case of the abstract system , obtained by setting @xmath54 and @xmath24 with the boundary condition .",

    "we omit the proof of this result , which is based on a standard galerkin approximation procedure ( see , for istance @xcite ) , together with a slight generalization of the usual gronwall lemma .",
    "in particular , the uniform - in - time estimates needed to obtain the global existence are exactly the same we use in proving the existence of an absorbing set .    in light of proposition  [ eu ]",
    ", we define the _ solution operator _ @xmath58 as @xmath59 besides , for every @xmath60 , the map @xmath61 belongs to @xmath62 .",
    "actually , it is a standard matter to verify the joint continuity @xmath63    [ semigroup ] in the autonomous case , namely when @xmath3 is time - independent , the semigroup property @xmath64 holds for all @xmath65 .",

    "it is well known that the absorbing set gives a first rough estimate of the dissipativity of the system . in addition , it is the preliminary step to scrutinize its asymptotic dynamics ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . here , due to the joint presence of geometric and cable - response nonlinear terms in , a direct proof of the existence of the absorbing set via _",
    "explicit _ energy estimates is nontrivial .",
    "indeed , the double nonlinearity can not be handled by means of standard arguments , as either in @xcite or in @xcite .",
    "dealing with a given time - dependent external force @xmath3 fulfilling suitable translation compactness properties , a direct proof of the existence of an absorbing set is achieved here by means of a generalized gronwall - type lemma devised in @xcite .",
