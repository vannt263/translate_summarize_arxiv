    "i have made an attempt to introduce the basics of differential geometry in the style of a mathematics text : the ideas are grouped by mathematical subject as opposed to physical subject .",
    "nonetheless , i follow each newly developed topic with an example from soft matter , not only to illustrate the usefulness of the mathematical structure but also to aid the reader with a concrete example .",

    "the context should make clear any lack of precision .",
    "finally , i have tried to reduce as much as possible the use of the powerful formalism of differential geometry . while this formalism is useful for performing complex calculations unambiguously , great expertise is often required to extract the geometrical and physical meaning of these calculations .",
    "an excellent complement to these notes are the lecture notes by franois david @xcite which present the mathematical elegance and logical compactness of this subject .",
    "random walks abound in physics .",
    "they are the basis for understanding diffusion , heat flow and polymers .",
    "however , polymers are the most interesting of the three : polymers , unlike diffusing particles leave a `` tail '' behind them which they must avoid .",
    "they are described by self - avoiding random walks . as an introduction to the power of geometrical modelling , in this section we will consider the behavior of stiff polymers at the shortest lengthscale amenable to a continuum analysis . at these scales , polymers are not random walks at all , but should be thought of as stiff rods .",
    "we take this as our starting point . when we describe a polymer as stiff",
    ", we are ascribing to it an energy cost for being bent . to model this , we consider a curve @xmath0 , parameterized by its arclength @xmath1 and construct the tangent vector to our curve @xmath2 at a point @xmath1 on the curve . in the next section",
    "we will show that the tangent vector is of unit length .",
    "if the tangent vector is constant along the curve then it is a straight line and does not bend .",
    "thus the energy should depend on derivatives of the unit tangent vector @xmath3 .",
    "indeed we call the magnitude @xmath4 the curvature of the curve . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the geometry of curves in greater detail . in the meantime , we write the energy as : @xmath5 ^ 2 ds,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a parameter that measures the arclength of the curve , and @xmath6 is a measure of the stiffness .",
    "to study the statistical mechanics of the curve we write the partition function for @xmath7 : @xmath8 e^{-e_{\\rm curv}[{{\\bf t}}]/{k_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\rm b}t}}\\ ] ] this is the partition function for the curve which starts with its tangent vector along the @xmath9-direction and ends with its tangent vector equal to @xmath10 .",

    "the schrdinger equation is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angular momentum operator .",
    "changing back to our original coordinate @xmath1 and defining @xmath21 we have @xmath22 we will soon discover that @xmath23 has an important interpretation .",
    "since the polymer is the same all along its length , we have @xmath24 . using polar coordinates and enforcing the limits of integration in ( [ epartitioni ] ) so that @xmath25",

    "the first equation shows that the tangent vectors along the curve are uncorrelated after a distance @xmath23 .",
    "for this reason @xmath23 is called the persistence length @xcite .",
    "the second equation shows us that for @xmath37 much longer than @xmath23 , a stiff rod behaves as a random walk : _ i.e. _ the average square distance that is travelled is proportional to the number of steps or length of the walk , @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath37 much shorter than @xmath23 , we may expand ( [ esolofit ] ) to see that @xmath39 .",
    "the physics of stiff rods can be used to study other phenomena .",
    "for instance , vortices in fluids , superfluids and superconductors have a bending stiffness arising from self - interactions . in the past decade the physics of stiff rods has been adapted to study the mechanical properties of dna @xcite , and has been augmented to include twisting degrees of freedom @xcite , the topological constraints imposed by self - avoidance @xcite and by closed loops @xcite , and the effects of sequence disorder @xcite .",
    "= 2.5truein    in the previous section we have seen that a simple geometrical description of polymers leads to a precise description of their conformational behavior in a variety of regimes .",
    "it is now time to discuss more carefully the geometry that went into making the expression for energy in ( [ ecurvature ] ) .",
    "a curve in three dimensions is a vector - valued function @xmath40 $ ] that depends on @xmath1 , a parameter that runs along the curve .",
    "though we may choose to label points along the curve as we wish , it is usually most convenient to let @xmath1 be the arclength along the curve .",
    "we will see how this simplifies our equations shortly .",
    "if the curve is @xmath37 long , then @xmath1 runs from @xmath41 to @xmath37 .",
    "the first thing to do is to construct the unit tangent vector to the curve : as we have already asserted , the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector is the curvature @xmath42 of the curve .",
    "we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the derivative of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath1 , and @xmath46 is the length of the vector @xmath47 .",
    "we have divided by the length of @xmath48 to make @xmath3 a unit vector . however ,",
    "if @xmath1 measures the arclength along the curve then @xmath49 ! to see this , recall that the length of a curve @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 can be found by adding ( integrating ) the length of pieces of the curve together , each @xmath53 long : @xmath54 if we choose @xmath55 to be the arclength then we have @xmath56 where the upper limit is the same as the length of the curve . differentiating both sides of ( [ especlength ] ) , we see that @xmath49 .",
    "having constructed the unit tangent vector , we may now take its derivatives to obtain the curvature . since the derivative of a vector is another vector , we write @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the curvature at @xmath1 and @xmath59 is a new vector , _ the unit normal vector _ , which is also unit length , so that @xmath60 .",
    "it is convention to choose @xmath58 to be always positive  the sign can alway be absorbed in the direction of @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath61 since the derivative of _ any _ unit vector is perpendicular to itself ; if @xmath62 then @xmath63 & = & { d\\over ds}[1]\\nonumber\\\\ 2{\\bf x}(s)\\cdot{\\bf x}'(s ) & = & 0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course , as we move along @xmath1 , the normal vector changes direction as well .",
    "changes in the direction of the normal vector can come from two contributions : the normal can change by rotating towards or away from the tangent vector ( of course the pair rotate together to stay perpendicular ) .",
    "it can also change by rotating _ around _ the tangent vector .",
    "the former case corresponds to the curve staying in the same , flat plane , while the second corresponds to rotations of the plane in which the curve lies at @xmath1 .",
    "this plane is known as the _ osculating _ plane , from the greek word for kissing . moreover , since @xmath64 is perpendicular to @xmath59 , we must introduce a third unit vector to account for changes in the osculating plane .",
    "we choose @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the cross product , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this vector , _ the binormal vector _ , is a unit vector perpendicular to both @xmath3 and @xmath59 . we then have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is some function of @xmath1 and @xmath69 is called the _ torsion _ of the curve .",
    "it is a measure of the rate of change of the osculating plane . why do nt we give @xmath68 a name ? because we note that by differentiating the relation @xmath61 we get : @xmath70 so @xmath71 and ( [ etorsion ] ) becomes : @xmath72    finally , we may calculate @xmath73 to complete our analysis of the curve .",
    "we have @xmath74 where the last line follows from the rule @xmath75 . putting ( [ enormal ] ) , ( [ etorsionii ] ) , and ( [ ebinormal ] ) together we have the frenet - serret equations for a curve in three - dimensions : @xmath76   = \\left [ \\begin{matrix } 0 & \\kappa(s)&0\\\\ -\\kappa(s)&0&\\tau(s)\\\\ 0&-\\tau(s)&0\\end{matrix}\\right ] \\left[\\begin{matrix}{{\\bf t}}(s)\\\\ { { \\bf n}}(s)\\\\ { { \\bf b}}(s)\\end{matrix}\\right]\\ ] ] this shows that @xmath58 is the rate of rotation of @xmath3 about @xmath77 and similarly , @xmath69 is the rate of rotation of @xmath59 about @xmath3 . written as one matrix equation , the frenet - serret formula tell us something very important : given a curvature @xmath58 and a torsion @xmath69",
    ", we can reconstruct our entire curve up to a translation ( since we can change the origin ) and a rotation ( since we can rotate the initial orthonormal triad @xmath78 .",
    "once we have set the location and orientation of that triad , however , the entire curve is determined by only two parameters , not three as one might have thought .",
    "there is a difficulty with the frenet - serret frame : when the curvature vanishes , @xmath59 is not well - defined and therefore @xmath77 and , more importantly , the torsion are not defined either .",
    "thus curves that have straight segments are problematic from the point of view of the frenet - serret frame . moreover , if we consider a helix @xmath79\\ ] ] then the curvature and torsion are constant : @xmath80 as @xmath81 we approach a straight line . however , though the curvature vanishes in this limit , the torsion does not !",
    "this is a problematic feature of the frenet - serret frame  since the torsion is the magnitude of the derivative of @xmath59 , it is only a meaningful quantity when @xmath82 is unambiguously defined , and this requires that @xmath83 . in  * iii*b , we will offer a different frame that does not suffer from this problem .",
    "knowing that the there are only two parameters needed to describe a space curve , we can now augment ( [ ecurvature ] ) to include other effects . one interesting effect @xcite is the behavior of _ chiral _ polymers .",
    "while the curvature does not distinguish between left and right handed helices , we can see from ( [ etorcurv ] ) that the torsion is sensitive to the sign of @xmath84 .",
    "thus we might add terms to ( [ ecurvature ] ) to favor a particular chirality for the stiff polymer .",
    "we might be tempted to write @xmath85 ^ 2\\right\\}.\\ ] ] though this energy appears acceptable , and favors an average torsion @xmath86 , it only accentuates the ambiguity of @xmath87 when @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , since ( [ ecurvature ] ) is a functional of @xmath0 , we should construct the new energy only in terms of @xmath0 and its derivatives .",
    "in addition to @xmath89 ^ 2=[{{\\bf t}}'(s)]^2 $ ] , we can also construct the term @xcite @xmath90.\\ ] ] from the frenet - serret formula , we then have : @xmath91 where @xmath6 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are all positive . note that in the special case of constant curvature and torsion , @xmath95 ^ 2=\\kappa^2\\tau^2 $ ] .",
    "we have added this term and the extra quartic term to @xmath96 for reasons that will become clear in the following .",
    "this form does not suffer from the torsion ambiguity : when @xmath97 the torsion drops out of ( [ eaugment ] ) .",
    "one can minimize this energy for the helix ( [ ehelix ] ) , which has constant curvature and torsion , to find the ground state conformation of a chiral polymer .",
    "for appropriate parameter values , the tendency for torsion can overcome the tendency to be straight and both @xmath42 and @xmath87 will be nonvanishing .",
    "= 2.5truein    when we consider the energetics of closed curves , it is clear that the curvature can not vanish everywhere ( or the curve wo nt close on itself ) .",
    "we can actually establish a lower bound on the curvature energy by appealing to a theorem on the total curvature of the curve . not only will this be useful when considering closed polymer loops , the technology of the proof will help us later on when we consider the geometry of surfaces .",
    "fenchel s theorem states that the total curvature of a closed curve is at least @xmath98 .",
    "this is not unreasonable : a circle of radius @xmath99 has curvature @xmath100 and so the total curvature is @xmath101 . in general ,",
    "other closed curves only have _ more _ curvature ( in fact , only planar convex curves have an integrated curvature of exactly @xmath98 ) . the statement of the theorem is : @xmath102 for any closed curve , where , as usual , @xmath1 is the arclength of the curve .",
    "before we prove this fact , note that via the cauchy - schwarz inequality we have @xmath103 squaring both sides and using ( [ efenchel ] ) we find that the curvature energy ( [ ecurvature ] ) satisfies @xmath104    to prove fenchel s theorem we introduce the tangent spherical image @xcite of the curve : we take the tail of the unit tangent vector @xmath3 at @xmath0 and map it to the center of the unit sphere .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the tip of the tangent vector then traces out a curve @xmath105 on the surface of the unit sphere as @xmath1 goes from @xmath41 to @xmath37 .",
    "the differential of length of the curve on the tangent sphere is @xmath106 , in analogy with ( [ especlength ] ) .",
    "but the magnitude of @xmath107 is just the curvature , so we find that the length of @xmath105 on the unit sphere is @xmath108 the total curvature of our original curve @xmath0 .",
    "now we note that by definition of @xmath3 , @xmath109 so if the curve is closed , @xmath110 , and the left - hand side of ( [ espace ] ) is @xmath111 .",
    "this is really three equations , one for each component of @xmath7 .",
    "it tells us that the curve @xmath105 on the tangent sphere can never be in only one hemisphere . in order for the curve to close ,",
    "it must turn around .",
    "but if the tangent spherical map were in one hemisphere , we could take it to be the upper hemisphere where @xmath112 .",
    "yet if @xmath113 is always positive then its integral can not vanish ! therefore , given any hemisphere on the tangent sphere",
    ", the curve must be in it and its complement .",
    "but this means that @xmath105 must be _ at least _ the length of the equator , @xmath98 .",
    "we have thus proven ( [ efenchel ] ) .",
    "the value of this result is not just the bound on the energetics of a closed polymer .",
    "it has introduced us to the tangent map . as we will see in the following it",
    "is very useful to take vectors off of curves and surfaces and translate them to the center of the unit sphere .",
    "this was our first taste of this procedure .",
    "in closing this section we mention the fary - milnor theorem which pertains to the integrated curvature of a non - self - intersecting closed knot .",
    "not surprisingly , this theorem states that a knot has to go around at least twice : @xmath114 using the same reasoning that led to ( [ ebound ] ) , we have @xmath115 for a knotted closed curve .",
    "up until this point , we have been able to study the geometry of lines without the introduction of a frame : that is , all our results rely on the original tangent vector @xmath3 and its derivatives  at no point were we required to choose a basis or coordinate system to calculate any quantities .",
    "unfortunately , we can not continue our discussion of lines and we _ certainly _ can not discuss surfaces without introducing some more paraphernalia .",
    "we need to introduce a set of spatially varying basis vectors in order to define quantities in addition to the tangent vector , the curvature and the torsion .",
    "we need to make sure , however , that all of our _ physical _ quantities do not depend on our arbitrary choice . in this section",
    "we will derive and explain the mermin - ho relation @xcite , originally derived in the context of superfluid @xmath116he - a , a phase characterized by an order parameter with two directions , a `` long '' direction and a `` short '' direction perpendicular to it .",
    "though this section is the most technical , it is also straightforward",
    ". fortunately , once we have established this result we will be able to make use of it again and again in the following .",
    "often we have a vector @xmath117 defined everywhere on a surface or in space .",
    "it could be the director of a liquid crystal , the normal to a surface or some other field of interest .",
    "we now are interested in a vector @xmath118 which is always perpendicular to @xmath117 .",
    "this vector might point to the nearest neighbor or in some special direction on the surface . to define this vector ,",
    "we introduce two new unit vectors , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which are defined to be perpendicular to @xmath117 and each other so that @xmath121 is an orthonormal triad and @xmath122 . a vector which is defined relative to the spatially varying plane defined by @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    "will change not only because its true direction changes ( relative to a fixed triad ) but also because the basis vectors change .",
    "if @xmath118 is a unit vector then @xmath123{\\bf e}_1{({\\bf x})}+\\sin[\\theta{({\\bf x})}]{\\bf e}_2{({\\bf x})}$ ] is always perpendicular to @xmath124 .",
    "its derivatives in the @xmath125 direction are vectors as well . in the plane",
    "normal to @xmath124 their components are : @xmath126\\\\   { \\bf e}_2{({\\bf x})}\\cdot\\partial_i{\\bf n}{({\\bf x})}&=&\\cos\\theta{({\\bf x})}\\left[\\partial_i\\theta{({\\bf x})}+ { \\bf e}_2{({\\bf x})}\\cdot\\partial_i{\\bf e_1}{({\\bf x})}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{econstantinspaceb } & = & \\cos\\theta{({\\bf x})}\\left[\\partial_i\\theta{({\\bf x})}- { \\bf e}_1{({\\bf x})}\\cdot\\partial_i{\\bf e}_2{({\\bf x})}\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that @xmath127 in the final equality .",
    "notice that the derivatives of @xmath118 depend on both gradients of @xmath128 as well as derivatives of the spatially varying basis vectors @xmath129 .",
    "since the basis vectors were chosen arbitrarily , one might be concerned that the derivatives of @xmath118 are poorly defined .",
    "however , there is a concomitant change in @xmath128 whenever the basis vectors change so that the gradients of @xmath118 are well defined .",
    "the problem is with gradients of @xmath128 .    to disentangle the arbitrary dependence on basis vectors , we start by considering a vector @xmath130 which is constant in the instantaneous plane perpendicular to @xmath117 so that ( [ econstantinspacea ] ) and ( [ econstantinspaceb ] ) both vanish . for @xmath130 to be constant in the plane",
    "perpendicular to @xmath117 , @xmath128 must be equal to some @xmath131 with @xmath132 , where the last equality defines a new vector field @xmath133 called the _",
    "spin connection_. note that we can only solve this equation for @xmath131 if @xmath134 .",
    "if we now consider an arbitary vector perpendicular to @xmath117 , @xmath118 , we should focus not on gradients of @xmath128 , but rather on @xmath135 $ ] , which is a measure of how much @xmath128 deviates from its `` constant '' value .",
    "but @xmath136 , so @xmath137={{\\bm{\\nabla}}}\\theta{({\\bf x})}- { \\bm{\\omega}}{({\\bf x})}$ ] . thus we see that by subtracting @xmath138 from @xmath139 , we remove that part of @xmath128 that is induced by a spatially varying basis .",
    "moreover , even if @xmath140 is nonvanishing , we can generalize this discussion to form the combination @xmath141 , the _ covariant derivative_. it measures the true changes in @xmath128 , relative to @xmath131 .",
    "if @xmath135 $ ] is a smooth field then @xmath142=0 $ ] , or @xmath143 we might be tempted to set the left hand side equal to zero , since usually the curl of a gradient vanishes . however , as we are about to show , the curl of @xmath138 is not always zero !",
    "this means that there must be some sort of singularities or _ defects _ in @xmath128 ( and @xmath131  the difference @xmath144 is smooth ) .",

    "both the greek and roman indices run from @xmath149 to @xmath150 . now consider the object @xmath151 . since @xmath119 is a unit vector , its derivative is perpendicular to it .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath151 in terms of the basis vectors @xmath152 and @xmath153 : @xmath154 similarly , we can do the same for @xmath155 : @xmath156 putting these expressions into ( [ ecurlofomega ] ) and using the orthogonality of our triad , we find : @xmath157_i = \\epsilon_{ijk } a_j{({\\bf x})}c_k{({\\bf x})}.\\ ] ] by taking the dot product of equation ( [ edjeone ] ) with @xmath117 , we find @xmath158 .",

    "note that our choice of @xmath165 and @xmath120 is arbitrary so that @xmath138 is not a constant of the geometry .",
    "however , ( [ emh ] ) shows that @xmath166 only depends on @xmath117 , and not our choice of basis vectors !",

    "for example , imagine the triangle on the sphere connecting the north pole ( @xmath375n ) , pontianak , indonesia ( roughly @xmath376n , @xmath377w ) and loolo , the congo ( roughly @xmath376s , @xmath378w ) along great circles . at each vertex of this triangle",

    "there are many beautiful uses and examples of the interplay between gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in physical systems .",
    "for instance , avron and levine @xcite have considered dry foams on curved , two - dimensional surfaces . in this context , `` dry '' refers to the fact that there is no fluid between adjacent bubbles so that the walls between them can be treated as lines and the vertices may be treated as points .",
    "there are two key ingredients to the physics of dry foams : surface tension and pressure . in two dimensions",
    "the surface tension amounts to a line tension @xmath385 along the interfaces between neighboring bubbles .",
    "if the soap film is uniform then the line tension is constant as well .",
    "whenever the lines meet , mechanical equilibrium must be maintained .",
    "the pressure in the bubbles exerts a force on their boundaries .",
    "if two cells are separated by a boundary line then the pressure difference @xmath386 must be balanced by the boundary . as with the derivation of the wave equation ,",
    "the force exerted by the boundary curve @xmath105 is @xmath387 .",
    "however , the pressure exerts forces only within the surface and so we are only interested in the component of the force in the plane of the surface . according to the above discussion , that force is @xmath388 , and so the magnitude of the force is @xmath389 . in the case of planar foams , @xmath390 and this is known as the young - laplace law . to model the diffusion of gas from one cell to the other , we assume a simple dynamics where @xmath391 where @xmath392 is the number of gas molecules in the cell of interest , @xmath393 is the pressure difference between it and its @xmath394 neighbor",
    ", @xmath395 is the length of the boundary separating the cell from its @xmath394 neighbor , and @xmath396 is a diffusion constant .",
    "this dynamics captures the simple idea that if a bubble is higher pressure than its neighbors so that @xmath397 , then it loses gas , while if it has lower pressure it gains gas . using the generalization of the young - laplace law and the gauss - bonnet theorem we have : @xmath398 where @xmath399 are the internal angles .    for flat surfaces with @xmath400",
    "it is known that a hexagonal honeycomb network of boundaries minimizes the length of the cell walls @xcite .",
    "if we imagine starting with a stable configuration on a flat membrane and distorting the membrane , we should take each internal angle to be @xmath401 . doing so avron and levine @xcite found : @xmath402 if we seek a stationary configuration so that @xmath392 is time independent , we see that for flat membranes @xmath400 and only bubbles with @xmath403 sides are stationary : hexagons .",
    "if the surface has positive curvature , @xmath404 , and there is an instability . to make @xmath405",
    ", we see that @xmath406 .",
    "however , even if an area and an @xmath177 were found to make @xmath392 time independent , we can see that there is an instability : if the area grows then @xmath407 becomes positive so the bubble grows _",
    "more_. likewise ,",
    "if the bubble shrinks then the integral over @xmath302 gets smaller and so gas flows out of the bubble and it shrinks some more . thus on a positively curved surface the only stable situation is one for which one bubble overtakes the whole system .",
    "on the other hand , when the surface has negative gaussian curvature , it follows from a similar argument that when the area of the bubble increases @xmath408 and when the area shrinks @xmath409 . in the critical case of a flat membrane",
    "the stationary solution is a hexagon and it is neither stable nor unstable towards growth @xcite",
    ".      we can take ( [ egbtwo ] ) one step further by considering a closed surface . in this case",
    "we can integrate the gaussian curvature over the whole manifold .",
    "if we triangulate the entire surface to form a net , then we can use the gauss - bonnet theorem to establish a relation between the topology of the network and the total gaussian curvature . at each vertex",
    "there is a total angle of @xmath98 which is divided into the internal angles of the triangles meeting at that point .",
    "each face contributes @xmath410 to the total angle at the vertices in addition to the excess angle from that face , @xmath411 .",
    "adding all the triangles together we have : @xmath412 where @xmath413 is the number of vertices and @xmath414 is the number of faces .",
    "each face contributes three edges @xmath96 , but each edge is shared by two triangles , so @xmath415 .",
    "we then have @xmath416 this is a remarkable result . as we show in the bottom two graphs of figure 10 ,",
    "if we remove an edge from our network ( @xmath417 ) , two faces join into one ( @xmath418 ) , and we lose two vertices ( @xmath419 ) , so @xmath420 does not change !",
    "likewise if we add an edge @xmath420 is unchanged .",
    "thus our result does not require the use of triangles .",
    "this invariant is known as the _ euler characteristic _ @xmath421 .",
    "note that if we have any network that can be deformed into a sphere without cutting the edges or changing the vertices , then @xmath422 can be calculated using ( [ eeulerii ] ) for a perfect sphere , where the surface area is @xmath423 and the gaussian curvature is @xmath383 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath424 for a network with the topology of a sphere .",
    "suppose we take two faces on the sphere , deform them to be the same triangle and place them together , face - to - face . in the process",
    "we lose three edges ( @xmath425 ) , two faces ( @xmath426 ) and three vertices ( @xmath427 ) so @xmath428 . what have we done ?",
    "we have made a doughnut ( or a torus ) with one handle and have reduced the euler characteristic by two .",
    "clearly , any time we add a handle @xmath422 is reduced by two . if we define the _ genus _ @xmath429 to be the number of handles of the surface , then @xmath430 though the gaussian curvature was a geometric property , when integrated over the entire surface it becomes a topological invariant , independent of the local geometry .",
    "= 5.5truein    the euler characteristic can be used to understand the topology of defects on closed surfaces .",
    "suppose that we have a unit vector field @xmath431 living in the local tangent plane to a closed surface of genus @xmath429 . since @xmath431 lies in the tangent plane , we have @xmath432 , where we have reintroduced our vectors @xmath119 and @xmath120 which are everywhere perpendicular to the unit normal @xmath117 of the surface .",
    "we will try to cover the surface with a vector field that is single valued . in other words , if we integrate derivatives of @xmath431 around a closed curve , we should get back the same vector .",
    "but as we discussed in  * iii*b , to ensure this property we should focus on the covariant derivative @xmath433 .",
    "we will have a single - valued vector field when the curl of this derivative vanishes .",
    "in this case equations ( [ emh ] ) and ( [ egaussismh ] ) give : @xmath434\\cdot d{\\bf s } = { { \\bigcirc\\mkern-25mu\\int\\mkern-14mu\\int}}_m kds = 2\\pi\\chi\\ ] ] usually @xmath435 , but this result tells us that it is not true on an arbitrary genus surface @xmath168 .",
    "= 2.5truein    without presenting a detailed discussion on topological defects @xcite , we can see that @xmath436 does not vanish in the presence of a defect configuration and that on a two dimensional surface : @xmath437 where @xmath438 is the charge of the defect and @xmath439 is the corresponding position . to see this , we consider @xmath440 it is straightforward to calculate @xmath139 and then to integrate the gradient around a closed curve @xmath161 that contains the origin .",
    "we have @xmath441 where @xmath161 is the boundary of @xmath168 .",
    "since we may arbitrarily shrink the path @xmath161 around the origin and the integral remains constant , it must be that @xmath442 .",
    "generalizing this to an arbitrary collection of defects leads us to ( [ evortex ] ) .",
    "using ( [ evortex ] ) in ( [ etotaldefect ] ) gives us : @xmath443 this result is known as the _ poincar - brouwer theorem_. since a vector field must be single valued on the surface , @xmath438 must be an integer so that @xmath444 and @xmath445 are well - defined .",
    "this result tells us , for instance , that a vector field on the surface of a sphere must have two @xmath446 defects or one @xmath447 defect . on a torus , however , no defects are necessary .",
    "= 3.5truein    there is another , more geometric way to establish ( [ eindexthm ] ) .",
    "we first argue that two vector fields on the same surface must have the same total topological charge .",
    "consider two vector fields @xmath448 and @xmath431 .",
    "we can triangulate the surface so that each triangle contains at most one defect in @xmath448 and one defect of @xmath431 and that every defect is in some triangle . in each triangle",
    "we may now integrate @xmath449 and @xmath450 around the triangle boundary . the total topological charge @xmath451 of @xmath448 is @xmath452 and similarly for @xmath431 .",
    "note that to establish the angles @xmath453 and @xmath454 , we must choose basis vectors @xmath129 . since we know that @xmath449 depends on our choice of these vectors , the integrals of @xmath449 around each triangle depend on the underlying geometry through the mermin - ho relation ( [ emh ] ) .",
    "more importantly , each vector field on @xmath168 may require a different choice of basis vectors @xmath129 , since a defect in any particular triangle forces a constraint on @xmath129 .",
    "thus it is not , in general , possible to calculate @xmath451 and @xmath455 using the same set of @xmath129 .",
    "however , the difference between @xmath451 and @xmath455 is just @xmath456 \\cdot d{\\bf x } = 0.\\ ] ] the difference vanishes since the angle between @xmath448 and @xmath431 is independent of our choice of basis vectors .",
    "therefore when we sum over all triangles we get each edge twice but in opposite directions .",
    "since we do not need the basis vectors to define the integrals , it is clear that the integrals in opposite directions cancel and we get @xmath41 .",
    "thus any two vector fields have the same topological charge .",
    "we will now count the defects of a vector field that we construct on triangulated surface , via the following rules : ( 1 ) put a defect with @xmath446 charge at each vertex , ( 2 ) put a defect with @xmath446 charge at each center , and ( 3 ) put a defect with @xmath457 charge on each edge .",
    "we can see that this will produce a consistent vector field everywhere else , as shown in figure 11 .",
    "adding together the charges we have @xmath458 and so the topological charge is the euler characteristic for any vector field on the surface .",
    "a striking example of the effect of these defects can be seen when there is a coupling between the bending of the surface and the configuration of the vector field @xcite .",
    "for instance , if we have a vector field living on a closed surface then it must have two @xmath446 defects .",
    "but because the defects are discrete , when we consider ( [ etotaldefect ] ) we find that the gaussian curvature @xmath302 must also be confined to the core of the defect since we may also integrate ( [ emh ] ) over any submanifold of @xmath168 .",
    "but then all the gaussian curvature sits at the defects . if instead of viewing ( [ emh ] ) as a constraint , we write it as an energy : @xmath459 ^ 2 + f_{\\rm ch},\\ ] ] where @xmath460 is the free energy for the surface ( [ efreesurf ] ) , and @xmath6 is the spin - stiffness . on a flat surface",
    "we can always choose @xmath461 and so the first term in ( [ efreeforsurf ] ) just describes the usual goldstone mode of broken rotational invariance .",
    "on a curved surface the inclusion of @xmath462 is necessary in order to make the free energy uniquely defined .",
    "the energy ( [ efreeforsurf ] ) now represents a competition between surface bending and the requirement of two @xmath446 topological defects which serve as a source for gaussian curvature . both of these energies vanish for the plane , but",
    "if we restrict our topology to a sphere , for instance , then neither term can be made to vanish everywhere .",
    "balancing these two effects , a vesicle would form an oblate shape , as shown in figure 12 .",
    "we have covered the basic elements of the geometry of curves and surfaces .",
    "things become significantly more abstract in three dimensions because there is no analog of the normal vector , binormal vector or surface normal : the three dimensional system is not embedded in a higher dimensional space . though it might be hard to visualize how something can have curvature without an embedding space",
    ", we already know that it is possible .",
    "recall that the gaussian curvature could be measured without any knowledge of the surface normal .",
    "quantities with that property are called _",
    "intrinsic_. the general theory of relativity relies on intrinsic quantities to describe the curvature of four - dimensional space - time @xcite  there is no reference to a larger space in which our universe lives . though we will not go into any mathematical detail , it is worthwhile to describe two examples from soft materials .",
    "the first is the blue phases of chiral liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "these are phases in which there is a three - dimensional , periodic modulation of the nematic director @xmath117 with a lengthscale comparable to that of visible light .",
    "these usually exist only over a narrow temperature range and are stabilized by an often neglected term in the nematic free energy .",
    "the frank free energy for a nematic liquid crystal is @xmath463 ^ 2 +   k_3\\left[{\\bf n}{\\times}\\left({{\\bm{\\nabla}}}{\\times}{\\bf n}\\right)\\right]^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad+2k_{24}{{\\bm{\\nabla}}}\\cdot\\left[\\left({\\bf n}\\cdot{{\\bm{\\nabla}}}\\right){\\bf n } - \\left({{\\bm{\\nabla}}}\\cdot{\\bf n}\\right){\\bf n}\\right]\\big\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the standard elastic constants @xmath464 , @xmath465 and @xmath466 are a measure of the energy cost for splay , twist and bend modes , respectively @xcite . the last term with elastic constant @xmath467 is known as the _ saddle - splay _ term . though it is a total derivative , when there are defects present it can contribute to the energy .",
    "the blue phase is riddled with precisely those defects that contribute to saddle - splay .",
    "the remarkable thing about this term is that it is precisely the gaussian curvature as in ( [ egaussismh ] ) : @xmath468\\ ] ] what does this mean ? if there are surfaces to which the nematic director is normal , then the saddle - splay is the gaussian curvature of those surfaces .",
    "however , the saddle - splay is more general .",
    "even if the director is not a field of layer normals , the saddle - splay is a measure of curvature .",
    "indeed , the blue phases can be understood as unfrustrated systems in curved three - dimensional space @xcite .",
    "projecting this texture into flat space leads to the topological defects in these phases . a compelling and alternative way of viewing the blue phases is to view them as decorations of space filling minimal surfaces @xcite .",
    "it is the connection between topological defects and curvature that makes it possible to identify and locate defects in lattice simulations of liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "another three - dimensional system that can be understood in terms of curvature is the melting and freezing of hard - sphere fluids . in two dimensions , as hard - spheres condense from the fluid phase to the crystalline phase , they form close - packed triangles",
    ". eventually these can assemble into a triangular lattice .",
    "the situation is not so happy in three - dimensions .",
    "there , four spheres can close - pack into a tetrahedron , but tetrahedra can not assemble to fill space . as a result ,",
    "all lattices have a packing density lower than the best local packing .",
    "this difficulty can be viewed as a geometric frustration along the same lines as the blue phase . in positively curved space , however ,",
    "this frustration can also be eliminated @xcite , and tetrahedral close - packing can fill space .",

    "though the mathematics described here has a certain elegance and beauty , i hope that i have conveyed the utility of differential geometry in a variety of physical problems . while a geometric description of a system often leads to an intuitive perspective , there are many other arenas in which a geometric formulation of the problem is not only useful but essential",
