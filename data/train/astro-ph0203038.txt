    "in the last decade , embedded stellar disks or disky distorsions have been found in many elliptical and s0 galaxies ( scorza & bender 1995 hereafter sb95 ; seifert & scorza 1996 ) .",
    "they are characterized by a smaller scalelength and higher central surface brightness with respect to the large kpc - scale disks typical of lenticular and spiral galaxies .",
    "the existence of embedded disks gives further observational support to the idea that the disky ellipticals are the continuation of the sequence ranging from i m s through spirals to s0 s ( kormendy & bender 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "this suggests also a continuity in the formation history , whereby one or several parameters of the protogalaxy vary smoothly ( e.g. van den bosch 1998 ) .",
    "subarcsecond resolution provided by state - of - the - art ground and space - based telescopes have revealed even smaller stellar disks in the nuclear region of nearby galaxies . to date",
    "the smallest disks we know have scalelengths of few tens of pc and they have been identified in the nucleus of a handful of early - type disk galaxies : the s0 s ngc  3115 ( sb95 ; lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) , ngc  4342 ( van den bosch , jaffe , & van der marel 1998 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ) , and s0 ngc  4570 ( van den bosch et al .",
    "1998 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ; van den bosch & emsellem 1998 ) , and the sa ngc 4594 ( burkhead 1986 , 1991 ; kormendy 1988 ; emsellem et al . 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , nuclear stellar disks of gas , dust and stars have been found in the e3 galaxy ngc  5845 ( kormendy et al . 1994 ) and in the dwarf e2 galaxy ngc 4486a ( kormendy et al .",
    "although the photometric parameters are not known , these stellar disks appear to be similar to those of ngc 3115 and ngc 4594 . this phenomenon may be more common if some of the e and s0 galaxies with disky isophotes observed by ravindranath et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and rest et al .",
    "( 2001 ) turn out to host a nuclear stellar disk .",
    "the presence of nuclear disks raises the question about the epoch ( i.e. coeval or not with that of the host ) and mechanism ( i.e. external or internal origin ) of their formation .",
    "indeed , it is possible that they formed with a different mechanism than the one that formed normal s0 disks since their size is one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the blue colour of the nuclear disks of ngc  4342 , ngc  4570 and ngc  4486a suggests they are made of younger stars with respect to the bulk of their host galaxy ( van den bosch et al .",
    "1998 ; kormendy et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the framework of galaxy formation via hierarchical merging acquired gas may end up forming some of these nuclear stellar disks . on the other hand",
    ", they could be built up from gas transported towards the galaxy center during the secular evolution of a bar .",
    "this seems to be the case of ngc 4570 ( van den bosch & emsellem 1998 ) , where the observed features in photometry and kinematics correspond with the position of the main resonances of a small bar .",
    "furthermore , any model for the formation of nuclear disks has to account for supermassive black holes , which are supposed to reside in every galaxy and whose gravitational influence may extend to pc scale of the disks .",
    "galaxies hosting nuclear disks are not exceptions in this context as ngc 3115 , ngc 4342 , ngc 4594 , and ngc  5845 are known to harbour a central supermassive black hole ( kormendy et al .",
    "1996a , b ; cretton & van den bosch 1999 , kormendy & gebhardt 2002 ) . to date studies on nuclear stellar disks considered mainly elliptical or s0 galaxies but there is no a priori reason why they should not be present also in spiral galaxies .",
    "would this be true , such nuclear disks would be the result of star formation by gas either driven toward the center by a bar instability or acquired from the outside .    for these reasons",
    "we undertook a search for nuclear stellar disks in spiral galaxies based on hst / wfpc2 archive images . in this paper",
    "we present as a result of our investigation three new cases of spiral galaxies hosting a nuclear disk embedded in their main outer disk and bulge .",
    "we selected rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) galaxies classified as spiral ( @xmath0 ) , and with @xmath1 .",
    "we restricted our sample to galaxies within @xmath2 mpc ( for @xmath3 ) to be able to detect 10-pc scalelength nuclear disks on wfpc2/pc frames out to about @xmath4@xmath5 scalelengths .",
    "we did not exclude low - inclined galaxies from the sample since nuclear disks might have a different inclination with respect to their hosts .",
    "we searched the hst science archive looking for all the available images .",
    "we realized that wfpc2/f606w was the only camera / filter combination producing an homogeneous sample large enough for our purposes ( 159 galaxies ) .",
    "this resulted in a sample of 112 objects after we rejected those frames where galaxy nucleus was out or too close to the chip edge as well as those with too short exposure times .",
    "it has to be noted that all but 3 of the selected galaxies belong to 4 snap observing programs : ( 1 ) 57 objects were taken from the sample of disk galaxies ranging from e / s0 to spirals observed in program i d 5446 ( pi : g. illingworth ) ; ( 2 ) 33 are unbarred sa / sb spirals from program i d 6359 ( pi : m. stiavelli ) ; ( 3 ) 14 spirals were taken from the nearby seyfert galaxies observed in program i d 5479 ( pi : m. malkan ) ; ( 4 ) 5 are seyfert spirals from program i d 8597 ( pi : m. regan ) . in our final sample the hubble types ranging from sa to scd are well represented as well as the number of barred spirals roughly equals that of unbarred ones , although images were collected from hst programs based on different selection criteria .",
    "the on - the - fly calibrated wfpc2/f606w images of the 112 sample galaxies were retrieved from the hst archive .",
    "the different images of the same target were aligned and combined .",
    "cosmic ray events were removed with iraf tasks crrej and imedit .",
    "the conversion to the johnson system has been calculated using synphot in stsdas .",
    "since this correction depends on the spectral energy distribution of the object , it has been calculated using the kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) spectral templates .    as a first step to identify candidates hosting a nuclear disk we construct unsharp - masked images for all the sample galaxies , dividing each wfpc2/f606w frame by itself after being convolved with a circular gaussian of @xmath6 2,4 , and 6 pixels , respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the advantage of this procedure is to quickly enhance any surface - brightness fluctuation and non - circular structure extending over a spatial region comparable with the @xmath7 of the smoothing gaussian .    in the present context",
    "this enables first to set apart 74 galaxies whose nucleus is strongly affected by dusts , preventing any further analysis .",
    "this is the case of ngc  1637 shown , as an example , in fig .",
    "it should be noted that , in principle , one can check for the presence of dust lanes using images with different filters which are not available for the whole galaxy sample .",
    "however adopting different values for @xmath7 in the unsharp - mask allows to clearly reveal dust lanes , when present .",
    "successively , on the unsharp - masked images of the 38 remaining galaxies , we looked for the highly flattened nuclear structures which are possibly inclined nuclear disks .",
    "such flattened structures are not artifacts of the unsharp - masking procedure since they are always associated to a central increase of ellipticity as measured by performing the isophotal analysis using the iraf task ellipse .",
    "this subset of 38 galaxies ranges from sa to sm and from @xmath8 to @xmath9 as shown in fig . 2 and represents our qualified sample for which we are confident we are able to detect an inclined nuclear disk , if present .",
    "we found three objects , namely ngc 1425 , ngc 3898 and ngc 4698 , which show this flattened nuclear structure ( fig .",
    "1 ) . a positive fourth cosine fourier coefficient ( describing the disky deviation of the isophotes from pure ellipses )",
    "confirms the presence of a nuclear stellar disk in inner regions of these early - type spirals ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show the case of ngc  4539 as an example of those galaxies where we did not identify any nuclear flattened structure .      once the existence of the nuclear disks is established , we derived their photometrical properties by using the method described by sb95 . when adopting this technique to study the innermost regions of galaxies it is essential to restore the images from the effects of the hst point spread function ( psf ) in order to properly derive the nuclear disks parameters , as shown by scorza & van den bosch ( 1998 ) .",
    "such deconvolution was performed through the richardson - lucy method by means of the iraf task lucy .",
    "although susceptible to noise amplification , this algorithm has been proved by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to lead to a restored surface - brightness distribution comparable to the one obtained by means of a multi - gaussian representation ( monnet , bacon , & emsellem 1992 ) .",
    "we decided to deconvolve the images with a number of iterations between 3 and 6 .",
    "a larger number of iterations does not affect the result of the decomposition but amplify the noise .",
    "we believe that the results obtained by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are directly applicable to our case : we are dealing with images obtained with similar or longer integration times , galaxies with less steep surface - brightness profiles and nuclear disks with equal or larger scalelengths .    for each given image and nucleus position on the pc ( ngc 3898 , ngc 4698 ) or",
    "wf2 ccd ( ngc 1425 ) we adopted a model psf calculated using the tiny - tim package ( krist & hook 1999 ) .",
    "no correction for telescope jitter was necessary .",
    "the sb95 method consists in the iterative subtraction from the galaxy image of a thin disk model .",
    "the parameters of such a disk are varied until the departures from perfect ellipses are smallest ( i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nearly zero ) . for the disk component we assumed an exponential surface brightness profile , with central surface brightness @xmath12 , radial scalelength @xmath13 , and an inclination given by @xmath14 .",
    "we verified that the parameters of nuclear disks resulting from the photometric decomposition are not affected by small changes in psf ( e.g. its generation in different chip positions ) .",
    "the results of the photometric decomposition of the surface - brightness distribution of ngc 1425 , ngc 3898 and ngc 4698 are shown in fig .  3 and fig .  4",
    "3 we plot the ellipticity , position angle , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 fourier coefficient radial profiles before and after the nuclear disk subtraction . in fig .",
    "4 the same is true for the galaxy isophotes .",
    "the photometric parameters derived for the nuclear disks are given in tab .",
    "we discuss the individual objects .",
    "* ngc 1425 . * to obtain a residual bulge with nearly elliptical isophotes we needed to subtract two exponential thin disks of different scalelengths , central surface brightnesses and inclinations .",
    "if this difference in inclination is real we are facing two structures in an unstable configuration .    as discussed by scorza & van den bosch ( 1998 ) for the the nuclear and main disks of ngc 4342 , it is more likely we are looking at two thick disks of different thickness ( e.g. , the exponential spheroid disks of van den bosch & de zeeuw 1996 ) rather than two infinitesimally thin disks of different inclination .",
    "such a different thickness may be interpreted as due to the presence of two distinct exponential disks .",
    "alternatively we may think we are facing a non - exponential disk with tickness varying with radius .",
    "considering the two disk hypotesis , we note that the photometric properties of the larger - scale disk are close to those observed for disky ellipticals ( fig . 5 ) .    *",
    "ngc 3898 . *",
    "the galaxy hosts a small ( @xmath17 pc ) nuclear disk that is noticeable in particular from the fourier @xmath15 coefficient positive values , observed within @xmath18 . in terms of physical size",
    "this is the smallest disk so far detected .",
    "it possibly corresponds to the somewhat steeper rise of the stellar rotation curve measured in the inner @xmath19 and the two relative maxima in the stellar velocity dispersion at @xmath20 by vega beltrn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) but not considered in the dynamical modelling of pignatelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    *",
    "* although sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) include this galaxy in the carnegie atlas of galaxies as an example of the early - to - intermediate sa type , ngc 4698 has photometrical and kinematical properties which are uncommon among spiral galaxies .",
    "it shows a clear geometrical decoupling between bulge and disk and hosts a kinematically isolated core ( bertola et al .",
    "the nuclear stellar disk corresponds to this isolated core , which is rotating perpendicularly with respect to the galaxy main disk ( bertola et al .",
    "we have provided evidence for the presence of a nuclear disk in 3 early - type spirals , namely ngc 1425 , ngc 3898 and ngc 4698 over a qualified sample of 38 objects .",
    "the photometric properties of these 20-pc scale exponential disks are consistent with those of the 4 nuclear disks so far detected in disk galaxies of even earlier morphological type ( fig .",
    "we have not found nuclear disks neither in sbc ",
    "sm nor in barred galaxies although these classes represents the majority of our sample . to further address the demography of nuclear disks we need to apply the relatively easy approach adopted here ( based on unsharp - masking ) on a larger sample of galaxies , imaged at high spatial resolution in near - infrared pass - bands to deal with central dusts which prevented us to exclude the presence of nuclear disks in a large fraction ( roughly two thirds ) of our wfpc2/f606w sample galaxies .    without drawing general conclusions from such a limited number of galaxies ,",
    "nevertheless we have the indication that the presence of nuclear disks is restricted to s0 s and bulge - dominated unbarred spiral galaxies . in the framework of massive bulge formation through a process of hierarchical clustering merging",
    ", the nuclear disks may be the final result of dissipational and star - formation processes subsequent to a second acquisition event .",
    "to date however , there were only photometric and kinematical evidences that nuclear disks can also be formed via secular evolution of a bar ( e.g. ngc 4570 ) .    with ngc 4698 we showed for the first time that second events indeed represent a viable mechanism to build a nuclear disk in the center of disk galaxies .",
    "indeed the nuclear disk of ngc 4698 is geometrically ( this paper ) and kinematically ( bertola et al . 1999 ) decoupled in an orthogonal way with respect to the host galaxy .",
    "this phenomenon can be hardly explained without invoking the acquisition of external material from the galaxy outskirts ( see bertola & corsini 2000 ) .",
