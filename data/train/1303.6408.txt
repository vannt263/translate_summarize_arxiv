    "the study of transport coefficients and non - equilibrium dynamics in general has assumed a great significance in recent times .",
    "the impetus in this direction has been provided by the recent results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , in particular the elliptic flow which seems to be rather well described by nearly ideal hydrodynamics with a very low value of @xmath3 , close to the quantum bound @xmath4  @xcite , @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the coefficient of shear viscosity and entropy density respectively .",
    "this led to the description of quark gluon plasma as the most perfect fluid known  @xcite .",
    "this bound is however found to be violated , e.g. in the case of a strongly coupled anisotropic plasma  @xcite .",
    "of the two viscosities used to parametrize the leading order corrections to the stress tensor the shear viscosity @xmath5 is more commonly discussed , the magnitude of @xmath7 the bulk viscosity usually being much smaller in comparison .",
    "the latter actually vanishes as in the case of systems with conformal invariance e.g. a gas of non - interacting highly relativistic particles .",
    "breaking of conformal invariance of qcd due to quantum effects shows up through non - zero values of @xmath7 which is related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "an estimate of this can be obtained from the interaction measure determined from lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath7 and @xmath5 as a function of temperature is particularly relevant in the context of non - ideal hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions .",
    "whereas @xmath3 as a function of @xmath8 is expected to go through a minimum  @xcite at or near the critical value for crossover from the partonic phase , it is believed that @xmath9 may be large  @xcite or even diverging close to this value .",
    "these have been studied in the linear sigma model in the large-@xmath10 limit  @xcite and for a massless pion gas in  @xcite .",
    "the viscosities of a pion gas have received some attention in recent times . in the diagrammatic approach",
    ", one uses the kubo formula which relates the transport coefficients to retarded two - point functions  @xcite .",
    "the shear viscosity of a pion gas in this approach was evaluated in  @xcite .",
    "however , the kinetic theory approach being computationally more efficient  @xcite , has been mostly used to obtain the viscous coefficients .",
    "the @xmath0 cross - section is a crucial dynamical input in these calculations .",
    "scattering amplitudes evaluated using chiral perturbation theory  @xcite to lowest order have been used in  @xcite and unitarization improved estimates of the amplitudes were used in  @xcite to evaluate the shear viscosity .",
    "phenomenological scattering cross - section using experimental phase shifts have been used in  @xcite . while in  @xcite the effect of number changing processes on the bulk viscosity of a pion gas has been studied , in  @xcite unitarized chiral perturbation theory was used to demonstrate the breaking of conformal symmetry by the pion mass .",
    "our aim in this work is to construct the @xmath0 cross - section in the medium and study its effect on the temperature dependence of the viscous coefficients . for this purpose",
    "we employ an effective lagrangian approach which incorporates @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson exchange in @xmath0 scattering .",
    "a motivating factor is the role of the @xmath1 pole in @xmath0 scattering in preserving the quantum bound on @xmath3 for a pion gas as demonstrated through use of the phenomenological  @xcite and unitarized  @xcite cross - section in  @xcite .",
    "medium effects are then introduced in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 propagators through one - loop self - energy diagrams .",
    "now , the hadronic matter produced in highly relativistic heavy ion collisions is known to undergo early chemical freeze - out .",
    "number changing ( inelastic ) processes having much larger relaxation times go out of equilibrium at this point and a temperature dependent chemical potential results for each species so as to conserve the number corresponding to the measured particle ratios .",
    "we thus evaluate the bulk and shear viscosity of a pion gas below the crossover temperature in heavy ion collisions considering only elastic @xmath0 scattering in the medium with a temperature dependent pion chemical potential . in the process",
    "we extend our estimation of the shear viscosity at vanishing chemical potential  @xcite where a significant effect of the medium on the temperature dependence was observed .    in the next section , we briefly recapitulate the expressions for the viscosities obtained by solving the transport equation in the chapman - enskog approximation . in section",
