    "a number of experiments performed in the last 2 - 3 years can be characterized as key for the field . in particular , correlations in the @xmath0 decays have been measured recently in @xmath2be @xcite , @xmath3ne @xcite , @xmath4 mg @xcite , @xmath5fe @xcite , and @xmath6ag @xcite providing qualitatively new information about the @xmath0 decays . with correlation information becoming available , the @xmath0 decay studies are now turning into a field of research where precise information about structure and continuum dynamics can be obtained .",
    "it is clear that our ability to extract useful information from correlations is directly dependent on how well we understand the propagation of particles in the long - range three - body coulomb field .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", true two - proton decay ( @xmath0 radioactivity ) is an exclusively quantum - mechanical phenomenon , which has no analogue in classical physics .",
    "it is expected to be widely spread along the proton drip line with @xmath7 due to peculiarities of the pairing interaction .",
    "a consistent quantum - mechanical theory of two - proton radioactivity and `` democratic '' three - body decays of the coulombic nuclear systems has been developed in the series of papers @xcite , which we continue here , and has been applied to different physical cases in refs .",
    "the complete momentum correlations for the decay of a non - aligned three - body system can be described by two parameters .",
    "these parameters are chosen in this and our previous studies as the energy distribution parameter @xmath8 between any two of the particles and the angle @xmath9 between the jacobi momenta : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are mass numbers of the constituents , @xmath12 is a nucleon mass , and @xmath13 is a two - proton decay energy . for two - proton emitters these parameters can be constructed in two `` irreducible '' jacobi systems , called `` t '' and `` y '' , see fig .",

    "it was already understood in ref .",
    "@xcite that this deficiency is connected to the limited radial range of the calculations and the approximate nature of the boundary conditions employed for the treatment of the three - body coulomb asymptotic .    the classical extrapolation ( ce ) of momentum distributions was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite as a simple way to estimate the possible influence of the `` residual '' coulomb interaction .",
    "the basic idea is that , at small distances , particles are propagated by quantum - mechanical equations providing the three - body wave function ( wf ) @xmath15 with outgoing asymptotic . at some sufficiently large distance , the wfs",
    "are converted into `` events '' with definite coordinates and momenta by a monte - carlo ( mc ) procedure .",
    "however , at that time ( in 2002 the @xmath0 decay of @xmath5fe was just discovered with statistics of the order of ten events @xcite ) the need to improve this aspect of our calculations was assigned to the remote future and no detailed studies were performed .",
    "now it seems that the development of the field has achieved the stage where the need to improve this aspect of our approach has become evident .    in this work",
    "we discuss the method of classical extrapolation in detail , demonstrate its reliability by application to exactly - solvable three - body models with a simplified hamiltonian , and consider three `` key '' cases ( @xmath16be , @xmath4 mg , and @xmath5fe ) covering a broad range of possible charges , masses , and structures for the @xmath0 emitters .",
    "natural system of units with @xmath17 is used in this work .",
    "in this section we sketch the methods used to construct the approximate boundary conditions @xcite and outline existing problems .",
    "the asymptotic form of the three - body potentials in the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) method is @xmath18 where multiindex @xmath19 is a complete set of quantum numbers .",
    "the matrix @xmath20 arises due to contributions from the short - range nuclear forces , and @xmath21 are some integer numbers .",
    "the effective contribution of the short - range forces decreases as @xmath22 or faster in hypersherical space .",
    "the diagonal centrifugal term depends on the `` effective angular momentum '' @xmath23 .",
    "coulomb pairwise potentials generate the long - range part of the hyperspherical potentials behaving as @xmath24 . from the technical side",
    ", the three - body coulomb interaction causes problems due to long - range channel coupling ( nonzero nondiagonal `` sommerfeld parameters '' @xmath25 ) that does not allow one to decouple the hh equations on the asymptotic . to deal with this problem , the finite - size potential matrix ( in truncated hyperspherical basis ) can be diagonalized with respect to the long - range term by the orthogonal transform @xmath26 : @xmath27 this potential includes nondiagonal `` centrifugal '' terms @xmath28 and , to achieve the asymptotic in the diagonalized representation , we still need to go very far in @xmath29 value , where the terms @xmath30 become negligible compared to those with @xmath31 . at such @xmath29 values , the hyperradial part of the asymptotic solution with pure outgoing nature can be constructed in the form @xmath32 the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the ordinary regular and irregular coulomb functions .",
    "hyperspherical harmonics @xmath35 are functions of the 5-dimensional `` solid angle '' @xmath36 . here",

    "[ eq : hh - coord ] ] and @xmath41 .",
    "the value @xmath42 should be larger than 3/2 , but otherwise does not seem to be particularly important .",
    "the wfs @xmath43 provide the necessary boundary conditions for the decay problem .",
    "the proposed boundary conditions are exact on the _ truncated _ hyperspherical basis at a hypersphere of _ very large _ radius .",
    "however on a practical level ,",
    "these two requirements contradict each other : the movement further in radius requires the increase of the basis size ; a larger basis size may require a larger radius .",
    "therefore , at some point , the further radial propagation of the solution ( with fixed basis size ) leads to a deterioration of its quality . for @xmath5fe with the decay energy of 1.154 mev and the basis size of @xmath44 , radii between 500 and 2000 fm",
    "are needed to get reasonable solutions .",
    "there exists an analytical asymptotic of the three - body coulomb problem ( a so called `` redmond - merkuriev '' asymptotic @xcite ) , which is presumably applicable to the true three - body decay .",
    "practical application of this asymptotic is technically complicated and it seems that there exists a very limited experience in using such an asymptotic . at the moment we are going to avoid these complexities and to demonstrate that there exists a simple and practical way to treat the problem .",
    "to perform a classical extrapolation of the quantum - mechanical result , we need to switch from a wf to classical trajectories",
    ". this should be made at some closed surface around the decay region .",
    "the procedure becomes especially simple if the whole surface is located in the region of classically allowed motion .",
    "then the flux vectors at the surface can provide initial conditions for classical trajectories .",
    "when using the hh coordinates there is only one variable @xmath29 , which has a dimension of length [ the 6-dimensional flux can be calculated for different @xmath29 values , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : newton - flux ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , it is natural in this approach to select the hypersphere with a large radius @xmath45 as such a surface .",
    "we will see later that tiny regions on the hypersphere with a large radius , where the pairwise distances appear to be small , do not lead to problems as the wfs in these regions are strongly suppressed .",
    "this happens due to the energy conditions defining the true @xmath0 decay : there are no long - living states in either pair of the three constituents and the strong coulomb repulsion rapidly `` expels '' particles from the regions where they are close to each other .",
    "a less evident , but important requirement is that the hyperradius @xmath45 is large enough that the typical distances between each pair of particles significantly exceeds the typical quantum coherence length ( the `` corpuscular '' aspect of the problem is then far prevailing over the possible wave effects ) .",
    "this is a complicated issue and in each case an acceptable minimal value of @xmath45 should be defined by numerical experiment .",
    "the classical trajectories formed at this hypersphere @xmath45 are propagated to distances @xmath46 at which the momentum distributions are stabilized ( what this exactly means we will see below ) .",
    "after this , the momentum distributions are reconstructed from the set of trajectories .",
    "the pairwise distances , the jacobi vectors , and the hyperradius are connected by the following relations @xmath47 in the definition of the hyperradius @xmath29 , particle @xmath48 should be a heavy core if @xmath49 and @xmath50 are defined in the `` t '' jacobi system and either @xmath51 or @xmath52 should be a core in the `` y '' jacobi system ( see also fig.[fig : jacobi ] for the numbering convention ) .",

    "the momentum distribution ( distribution density ) is found as the differential of the flux @xmath61 $ ] , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : corel - param ] ) . in this work",
    "we compare the quantum - mechanical distributions calculated at @xmath57 ( called below `` without classical extrapolation '' or `` initial '' ) with distributions obtained by classical extrapolation to @xmath62 ( `` with classical extrapolation '' or `` final '' ) .",
    "it is implied above that the flux is averaged over the initial spin states and summed over the final spin states . therefore the components of the wf @xmath15 with different total spin @xmath63 can be considered as different `` particles '' whose contributions to the total momentum distribution should be added incoherently .    in general , three particles ( or two jacobi vectors ) define a plane . within this plane , the set of 6 equations ( [ eq : newton ] )",
    "can be reduced to 4 equations .",
    "however , the momentum vectors do not necessarily belong to this plane .",
    "it is evident that the geometry of the problem remains planar in the case of zero angular momenta of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 subsystems ( this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jacobi ] ) . for nonzero angular momenta ,",
    "some additional considerations are required .",
    "let us consider the flux field induced by the ordinary two - body wf with @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 , the flux is purely radial as the angular part of the wf @xmath66 is real ( flux is an imaginary part of the gradient matrix element ) .",
    "for purely radial flux , the classical angular momentum associated with the particular trajectory is zero ( radius and momentum vectors are collinear ) .",
    "this can be seen as a source of a confusion as the quantum - mechanical momentum of the wf and the classical momentum of the selected trajectory are explicitly different .",
    "the answer seems to be that the classical characteristic of the trajectory should be related to average corresponding characteristic of the wf .    in the three - body case ,",
    "the ground - state wfs typically have two major components : the dominating @xmath67 component and an `` admixture '' @xmath68 component .",
    "we imply here that a spin - zero core is considered ; the two spin 1/2 protons can then be coupled into the total spins @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath67 component of the wf is formed by terms with angular momenta in the subsystem @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to check that the angular part of this wf @xmath72_{00}$ ] is real and thus the classical angular momentum associated with any trajectory induced by this wf is zero .",
    "the decay in this case is _ planar _",
    "( we mean that for any generated event , a plane can be selected in which the coordinate vectors and the momentum vectors of all three particles are simultaneously located ) .",
    "it is more complicated when the @xmath68 component is considered .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that for the @xmath72_{1m}$ ] component of the wf with @xmath73 , the configuration of the classical momenta is planar , while for @xmath74 , the planes formed by the three radii and by the three momenta does not coincide . however according to the wigner - eckart theorem , in order to define the observables it is sufficient to calculate the matrix elements for only one projection and the rest are reconstructed by the angular momentum algebra .",
    "therefore , it seems sufficient to calculate the distributions for @xmath73 ( planar case calculations are especially simple ) , while the distributions for @xmath75 should be the same .",
    "@xcite , a semianalytical model was developed which allows one to treat exactly the asymptotic behaviour of the three - body coulomb wf for certain simplified three - body hamiltonians .",

    "it is important to note that large hyperradii are used to start the classical extrapolation procedure . specifically for true @xmath0 decay with such large hyperradii ,",
    "practically the whole wf resides is in the classically allowed region ( probability to find the system in the classically forbidden region is very small ) .",
    "for example , for the @xmath5fe calculation with hyperradius @xmath101 fm and mc generation of @xmath154 events it is typical that not a single event is generated which is situated in the classically forbidden region .",
    "this fact confirms the validity of the choice of a hypersphere as the surface at which the switching from quantum - mechanical to classical methods is performed .",
    "the discussion of the @xmath5fe case can provide an illustrative example here .",
    "so far , the decay process of @xmath5fe with the half - life of 2.6 ms @xcite was measured in gas ( or solid state ) detectors .",
    "this means that at the moment of decay , @xmath5fe has completely recovered electron shell .",
    "the bohr radius for @xmath5fe is @xmath155 where @xmath156 is total charge of @xmath5fe .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the screening effect of the inner most electrons becomes observable at about 2000 fm .",
    "classical trajectories for @xmath5fe in kinematical space are well stabilized by @xmath157 fm , but there is a minor drift up to much larger distances .",
    "it is clear that some effect of the electron screening on the momentum distributions can be expected .",
    "the binding energy of all electrons estimated as independent particles is @xmath158 ( @xmath159 is a principal quantum number of the shell ) , which gives 52.3 and 47.8 kev for @xmath5fe and @xmath160cr , respectively .",
    "so , when @xmath5fe emits two protons at least two electrons should be ejected carrying away 4.5 kev of energy .",
    "the estimated velocities of protons with energies around 0.5 mev and electrons with energies around 1 kev are 0.033 and 0.063 .",
    "these velocities are comparable , which means that the @xmath0 decay of atomic @xmath5fe would be accompanied by a strong reconstruction of atomic structures having the same timescale .",
    "it is reasonable therefore to make estimates of a screening with the @xmath5fe electron density , but only for 24 electrons .",
    "this will somehow account for the effect of the electron shell disintegration during the @xmath0 decay of @xmath5fe and provide a nuclear plus atomic coulomb potential tending to zero at infinity .",
    "the electron density used for the screening calculations and the potentials obtained are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scr-1 ] .",
    "one can see already that at 2000 fm , the full @xmath161 coulomb potential is noticeably reduced due to the screening compared to nuclear coulomb potential ( the reduction factor is 0.8 ) . at 7000 fm the reduction factor is 0.5 and it tends to zero at 30000 fm .",
    "the radial stabilization of the values @xmath119 and @xmath153 in the screening case compared to the purely nuclear case is shown in fig.[fig : fe - traj - scr ] for one selected trajectory .",
    "it can be seen that in the screening case , the trajectory stabilizes at @xmath162 fm . in the purely nuclear case , the minor drift of the trajectory continues to much larger @xmath29 values .",
    "the calculations show that in the `` t '' system , the screening effect is largest for the variable @xmath153 .",
    "it is typically at the level of @xmath163 of the absolute value of this variable and , for @xmath101 fm , it typically accounts for @xmath164 of the ce effect . for an effect which is @xmath163 at the absolute scale",
    "it is difficult to speculate about its observability just now : its scale is comparable to the widths of the lines in our plots . however , if we think about it as an effect of the atomic surrounding on nuclear decay properties , then such a value can be considered as an impressive one .    it should be noted that the existence of the screening effects is the subject of the experimental technique employed . for example , the @xmath0 decay in @xmath4 mg was studied in the decay - in - flight experiment ref .  @xcite . in this experiment the @xmath4 mg g.s .  was populated by the neutron knockout from the relativistic beam of the completely stripped @xmath165 mg ions . the resulting @xmath4",
    "mg is also completely stripped and can hardly pick up any electrons before the decay .",
    "therefore , in spite of a long lifetime ( @xmath116 ps , which is much longer than typical recombination time ) , screening in this experiment will have different character , compared to the case discussed above for @xmath5fe .",

    "[ fig : mg - traj ] and [ fig : fe - traj ] , it is possible to see that there exist so called `` stationary points '' in the kinematical @xmath143 plane in the `` t '' system . for such points ,",
    "the classical trajectories in this plane have zero length . for the degenerate situation @xmath167 ,",
    "the stationary behavior is trivial ; this situation is not very interesting as the phase space for such configurations in the quantum - mechanical problem tends to zero .",
    "however there exist nondegenerate stationary points , and which for two - proton decay with a heavy core @xmath127 are found as : @xmath168 these stationary points are defined by the condition that the force acting on each particle is always directed exactly along the line connecting that particle with the center of mass of the whole three - body system .",
    "such stationary points should exist for any two - body potential with the same power dependence on radius @xmath169 for each pair of the particles .",
    "the values of @xmath119 equal to 0.497 , 0.382 , 0.379 are found for @xmath16be , @xmath4 mg , and @xmath5fe , respectively , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : stationary ] ) as well as by a direct calculations using eq .",
    "( [ eq : newton ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the solution , which is a stationary one in the @xmath143 plane , is an analogue of the lagrange solution in celestial mechanics ( with reservation that we are dealing here with repulsive @xmath170 potentials ) .",
    "the multi - cluster decays of nuclear systems has been qualitatively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "a quasiclassical approach was used , based on the classical self - similar solutions of the few - body coulomb problem .",
    "the stationary point discussed above represents such a self - similar solution in our specific case .",
    "it was concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite that `` three - cluster configuration asymptotically approaches to an expanding self - similar triangle whose sides obey the @xmath171 rule . ''",
    "this statement is probably not completely correct .",
    "it can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : mg - traj ] and [ fig : fe - traj ] that there is a trend for classical trajectories to tend somehow towards the stationary point which corresponds to a self - similar solution .",
    "this trend leads to certain systematic modifications of the momentum distributions by the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "however as we have seen in this work , the whole picture is more complex .",
    "the total distributions occupy broad regions of the kinematical plane .",
    "they are determined mainly by the internal structure of the three - body system and the decay dynamics under the barrier , than by the long - range coulomb interaction outside of the barrier .",
    "classical trajectories originating on the hypersphere of large radius each converge to its own final position which , in a general case , could have nothing in common with a stationary point .",
    "in this work we discuss the extrapolation along the classical trajectories as a method to improve the momentum distributions for radioactive @xmath0 decay ( true three - body decay ) .",
    "the proposed method provides near perfect description of the distributions in the test cases of simplified three - body hamiltonians . in the case of real three - body coulomb interactions considerable quantitative effects on the distributions are observed . in the case of the lightest @xmath0-emitter @xmath16be",
    "this effect is minor , but in the heavier @xmath0-emitters ( @xmath4 mg and @xmath5fe ) the improvement is essential for the precise description of the distributions .    it should be emphasized that some aspects of the momentum distributions for @xmath0 decays are sensitive to the long - range three - body coulomb interaction , while the others are absolutely insensitive .",
    "namely , the angular distribution in the jacobi `` t '' system and the energy distribution in the jacobi `` y '' system are considerably modified by the classical extrapolation .",
    "two other inclusive distributions ( the energy distribution in the jacobi `` t '' system and the angular distribution in the jacobi `` y '' system ) are essentially not influenced by the classical extrapolation .",
    "therefore the long - range part of the three - body coulomb does not practically change the information about the internal structure of the decaying system which is contained in the latter distributions .",
    "attention should be paid to the huge range which is required both for the extrapolation range ( @xmath144 fm ) and for the starting point of the classical procedure ( @xmath172 fm ) at typical decay conditions .",
    "the classical procedure is applicable only for distances above @xmath173 fm ( in @xmath29 variable ) for the considered set of @xmath0 emitters ( which is actually quite representative ) .",
    "the intermediate distances from @xmath174 fm ( where the protons come from under the coulomb barrier ) to around 1000 fm should to be treated quantum mechanically to obtain decent results from the classical extrapolation .    we have shown that the electron screening can have a sizable effect on the momentum distribution in the @xmath0 decay of atomic @xmath5fe .",
    "so , the @xmath0 radioactivity belongs to a rare class of nuclear phenomena , which exist on the borderline with atomic phenomena .",
    "there exist examples of weak radioactive decay modification induced by atomic electrons ( e.g.  due to the energy conditions making @xmath175 decay possible only into bound electron states @xcite or due to the hyperfine effect @xcite ) .",
    "we think that the sizeable sensitivity of the radioactive decay via particle emission due to a modification of the potential barrier properties in the atomic environment is demonstrated in our work for the first time .",
