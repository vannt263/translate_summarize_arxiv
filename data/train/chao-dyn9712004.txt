    "in this paper we study dynamical systems composed of a set of coupled quadratic maps @xmath0 with @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the value chosen for @xmath7 implies that , in the uncoupled limit ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , each unit transforms as a one - dimensional quadratic map in the accumulation point of the feigenbaum period - doubling bifurcation cascade .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath10 resembling the synaptic connections of a neural network , we call this system a feigenbaum network . the system ( [ 1.1 ] ) has a rich dynamical behavior and coupled systems of this type have been used in the past to model the dynamics of interacting populations@xcite @xcite .    the quadratic map at the feigenbaum accumulation point is not in the class of chaotic systems ( in the sense of having positive lyapunov exponents ) however , it shares with them the property of having an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits .",
    "therefore , before the interaction sets in , each elementary map possesses an infinite diversity of potential dynamical behaviors . as we will show later , the interaction between the individual units is able to selectively stabilize some of the previously unstable periodic orbits .",
    "the selection of the periodic orbits that are stabilized depends both on the initial conditions and on the intensity of the interaction coefficients @xmath11 . as a result",
    "feigenbaum networks appear as systems with potential applications in the fields of control of chaos , information processing and as models of self - organization .",
    "control of chaos or of the transition to chaos has been , in recent years , a very active field ( see for example ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several methods were developed to control the unstable periodic orbits that are embedded within a chaotic attractor . having a way to select and stabilize at will these orbits we would have a device with infinite storage capacity ( or infinite pattern discrimination capacity ) .",
    "however , an even better control might be achieved if , instead of an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits , the system possesses an infinite number of periodic attractors .",
    "the basins of attraction would evidently be small but the situation is in principle more favorable because the control need not be as sharp as before . as long as the system is kept in a neighborhood of an attractor the uncontrolled dynamics itself stabilizes the orbit",
    ".    the creation of systems with infinitely many sinks near an homoclinic tangency was discovered by newhouse@xcite and later studied by several other authors@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . in the newhouse phenomenon",
    "infinitely many attractors may coexist but only for special parameter values , namely for a residual subset of an interval .",
    "another system , different from the newhouse phenomena , which also displays many coexisting periodic attractors is a rotor map with a small amount of dissipation@xcite .    in sect .",
    "2 we prove that with only two units and symmetrical couplings one obtains a system which has an infinite number of sinks for an open set of coupling parameters .",
    "the mechanism by which an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits is stabilized by the coupling of two units depends strongly on the properties of the maps at the feigenbaum accumulation point .",
    "a similar mechanism would not operate , for example , in the tent map .",
    "the mechanism by which stable periodic orbits might be obtained in piecewise linear maps is quite different , as discussed in the last section of the paper .",
    "then , in sect.3 , we analyze the behavior of a feigenbaum network in the limit of a very large number of units . using a mean field analysis",
    "we show how the interaction between the units generates distinct periodic orbit patterns throughout the network .",
    "the framework and motivation for studying chaotic ( or chaotic - like ) networks for signal processing and pattern recognition is then discussed , a simple example being presented in the feigenbaum network setting .",
    "finally , in sect.4 , we add a few conclusions and discuss some other systems , with similar behavior , which might be useful for practical designing purposes .",
    "here we consider two units with symmetrical positive couplings ( @xmath12 )    @xmath13    the mechanism leading to the emergence of periodic attractors from a system that , without coupling , has no stable finite - period orbits is the permanence of the unstabilized orbits in a flip bifurcation and the contraction effect introduced by the coupling .",
    "the structure of the basins of attraction is also understood from the same mechanism .",
    "the result is :    * theorem * : _ for sufficiently small _ @xmath14 _",
    "there is an _ @xmath15_such that the system ( [ 2.1 ] ) has stable periodic orbits of all periods _",
    "@xmath16 _  for _ @xmath17_. _    * proof * :    the bifurcations leading to the feigenbaum accumulation point at @xmath7 are flip bifurcations .",
    "this means that , after each bifurcation , the orbit that looses stability remains as an unstable periodic orbit .",
    "therefore , ( for @xmath18 ) at @xmath19 the system ( [ 2.1 ] ) has an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits of all periods @xmath20 .",
    "the proof has two basic steps .",
    "first we need to prove that , for sufficiently small @xmath21 , these periodic orbits still exist in the system ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "second , that for any such @xmath14 , there is an @xmath15 such that there is at least one stable orbit for all periods @xmath22 with @xmath17 . for both steps an important role",
    "is played by the instability factor , given by @xmath23 at the fixed points @xmath24 of the @xmath25iterated map .",
    "therefore we will first find the behavior of this derivative for the periodic unstable orbits at @xmath19 and @xmath26    iterating once the feigenbaum - cvitanovic functional equation @xmath27 and taking derivatives one concludes @xmath28 because @xmath29 is the scaling factor that controls distances , if , for example , @xmath30 is the fixed point of @xmath31 closest to zero , the corresponding fixed point for @xmath32 will be at @xmath33 .",
    "eq.([2.3 ] ) means that for the scaling function @xmath34 , solution of the functional equation , the instability factor for all unstable periodic orbits is the same at @xmath19 .",
    "the logistic function is not a solution of the functional equation , however it shares the scaling properties of this solution at @xmath19 . therefore the instability factor @xmath35 of the orbits at @xmath7 will also converge to a fixed value . numerically one finds this value to be around @xmath36 .",
    "the exact value is not important however , because what matters for our result is that it is a non - zero uniformly bounded value for all orbits .",
    "we may now proceed to the proof of the theorem .    _",
    "first step _ : permanence of the periodic orbits for small @xmath14    let @xmath37\\times [ -1,1]$ ] be , for example , the coordinate of the @xmath25periodic orbit closest to zero .",
    "the sequence @xmath38 is an element of a @xmath39 banach space ( sup norm ) .",
    "the collection of fixed point equations @xmath40 defines a @xmath41mapping @xmath42 from @xmath43 . because @xmath44 at @xmath18 is negative and bounded for all @xmath45 , the derivative @xmath46 of the mapping in the first argument is invertible .",
    "therefore , by the implicit function theorem for banach spaces , there is a @xmath47 such that for @xmath48 the function @xmath49 is defined , that is , there are @xmath25periodic orbits for all periods @xmath22 .",
    "the derivative of this function is defined componentwise ( in @xmath45 ) by @xmath50    for the uncoupled case ( @xmath18 ) the instability factor @xmath51 for each mapping is the product @xmath52 over the orbit coordinates . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the orbit structure being preserved , their projections on the axis are continuous deformations of the @xmath18 case which will preserve the geometric relations of the feigenbaum accumulation point . hence the same products for the projected coordinates suffer changes of order @xmath54 and remain bounded .    _ second step _ : stabilization of at least one orbit for all periods @xmath55 with @xmath56    the stability of the periodic orbits is controlled by the eigenvalues of the jacobian @xmath57 in the fixed point of @xmath58 .",
    "the map ( [ 2.1 ] ) is a composition of two maps @xmath59@xmath60 @xmath61 by the chain rule the jacobian is @xmath62 with determinant @xmath63 because of the permanence of the periodic orbits , for small @xmath64 in the neighborhood of the original coordinates ( those for @xmath18 ) , the product of the last two factors in ( [ 2.4 ] ) is uniformly bounded for all @xmath45 .",
    "then for all sufficiently large @xmath45 , @xmath65 .",
    "the question is how this overall contraction is distributed among the two eigenvalues of @xmath66 .    to discuss the nature of the eigenvalues",
    "we may use a first order approximation in @xmath14 . for a periodic orbit of period @xmath22",
    "we define @xmath67 for small @xmath14 consider the linear approximation to the jacobian @xmath68@xmath69 the eigenvalues are @xmath70 if the periodic orbit runs with the two coordinates @xmath71 and @xmath72 synchronized then @xmath73 and the orbit being unstable for @xmath18 it remains unstable for @xmath21 . however if the two coordinates are out of phase by @xmath74 steps the radical in eq.([7 ] ) is @xmath75 the existence of a superstable orbit for all periods @xmath22 implies that at @xmath19 the product @xmath76 has an odd number of negative - valued coordinates .",
    "therefore the two eigenvalues are complex conjugate and , for small @xmath14 , the contraction implicit in ( [ 2.4 ] ) is equally distributed by the two eigenvalues . therefore for sufficiently large @xmath15 all orbits of this type with @xmath77 become stable periodic orbits .",
    "@xmath78    the conclusion should not depend on the use , in the last step , of a linear approximation ( in @xmath14 ) because the sign of the term under the radical is a consequence of the geometric nature of the orbits at the feigenbaum accumulation point .",
    "then at sufficiently small @xmath14 the conclusions of the linear analysis hold .",
    "the attracting periodic orbits of the coupled system being associated to the unstable periodic orbits of the feigenbaum cascade , the basins of attraction will be controlled by neighborhoods of these orbits in each coordinate .",
    "therefore a checkerboard - type structure is expected for the basins of attraction .",
    "fig.1 shows the structure of the basins of attraction of the orbits for @xmath79 .",
    "a mesh of @xmath80 , each point being an initial condition for the two units .",
    "the coupled system is allowed to evolve for @xmath81 time steps and then the sequence is analyzed and its period determined .",
    "periods are detected up to @xmath82 .",
    "the basins , labelled by the period of the orbits , are displayed using the color map in table i. the detected orbits have all periods from @xmath83 to @xmath84 but some of the basins are so narrow that they can hardly be seen in the figure .",
    "@xmath85    table i    the behavior described above holds only for very small couplings .",
    "numerically one finds that , as the coupling strength increases , the number of different stable periodic orbits decreases .",
    "a similar behavior occurs for networks with many units where , for large couplings , global synchronization or synchronization in clusters seems to be the rule as already been observed in the past by many authors that have studied coupled map lattices .",
    "for the calculations below it is convenient to use as variable the net input to the units , @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "then eq.([1.1 ] ) becomes , @xmath88    for practical purposes some restrictions have to be put on the range of values that the connection strengths may take .",
    "for information processing ( pattern storage and pattern recognition ) it is important to preserve , as much as possible , the dynamical diversity of the system .",
    "that means , for example , that a state with all the units synchronized is undesirable insofar as the effective number of degrees of freedom is drastically reduced . from @xmath89",
    "one sees that instability of the fully synchronized state implies @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the interesting case is when the off - diagonal connections are sufficiently small to insure that @xmath91    for large @xmath15 , provided there is no large scale synchronization effect , a mean - field analysis might be appropriate , at least to obtain qualitative estimates on the behavior of the network . for the unit @xmath92 the average value @xmath93 acts like a constant and the mean - field dynamics is @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath97 is the effective parameter for the mean - field dynamics of unit @xmath92 . from ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) it follows @xmath98 .",
    "the conclusion is that the effective mean - field dynamics always corresponds to a parameter value below the feigenbaum accumulation point , therefore , one expects the interaction to stabilize the dynamics of each unit in one of the @xmath99- periodic orbits . on the other hand to keep the dynamics inside an interesting region",
    "we require @xmath100 , the period-2 bifurcation point . with the estimate @xmath101 one obtains @xmath102 which",
    ", together with ( [ 3.3 ] ) , defines the interesting range of parameters for @xmath103 .    except for direct numerical simulations and mean - field analysis ,",
    "no other efficient techniques are available for the study of coupled maps with many units . however , as remarked by several authors @xcite @xcite , the mean - field is in general a problematic assumption . in the numerical simulations which we performed , to demonstrate the potential applications of feigenbaum networks as signal processors , we have indeed found that the mean - field analysis holds only for a small range of ( small ) couplings .",
    "it was in this narrow mean - field window that the numerical experiments were carried out .",
    "recent studies of biological systems suggest that complex and chaotic dynamics plays an important role in biological information processing@xcite . in the biological models the chaotic units are large interacting aggregates of neurons",
    "not the individual neurons themselves .",
    "it is therefore these aggregates that should be identified with the chaotic units in the mathematical models .",
    "in particular the evidence from the study of the mammalian olfactory system@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite is very interesting .",
    "the researchers that studied this system propose a strange attractor with multiple wings , each one being accessed depending on the initial conditions imposed by the external stimulus .",
    "however with one invariant measure associated to a unique attractor ( no matter how many wings it possesses ) we would expect the system to have a non - negligible probability to explore all regions , leading to unreliable pattern identification .",
    "it is probably better to consider that , to each external stimulus , corresponds a different invariant measure , a scheme that has recently been illustrated using bernoulli units@xcite .",
    "whatever the exact dynamical mechanism , schemes of this type where , from a low - intensity chaotic basal state , the system is excited into a different chaotic attractor , have a very high storage capacity due to the diversity of all possible dynamics and , on the other hand , display a very fast response time .",
    "the recognition time in the olfactory system ( in the sense of the time needed to switch between two space - coherent patterns ) being of the order of magnitude of the response time of individual neurons , a chaos - based mechanism is much more likely than the paradigm of attractor neural networks@xcite .",
    "a recognition time of the order of magnitude of the cycle time is incompatible with the fixed point paradigm , but it is easy to understand in a chaos - based scheme .    the feigenbaum attractor is not chaotic , in the lyapunov exponent sense .",
    "nevertheless , as an accumulation point of period - doubling bifurcations it accesses an infinite number of different periodic orbits and , in principle , is capable of processing a very large amount of information .",
    "as we have seen , a system of many such units , interacting through synaptic - type connections , is driven into periodic behavior by the coupling .",
    "the nature of the orbits reflects the pattern of synaptic connections and if these are obtained by a learning mechanism , through exposure to some external signal , the system might act as a signal identifier .",
    "if , in addition , the external signal is made to modulate some of the inputs to the individual units , mechanisms of associative pattern recognition would be obtained .",
    "let , for example , the @xmath11 connections be constructed from an input signal @xmath104 by a correlation learning process @xmath105 the dynamical behavior of the network , at a particular time , will reflect the learning history , that is , the data regularities , in the sense that @xmath10 is being structured by the patterns that occur more frequently in the data .",
    "the decay term @xmath106 insures that the off - diagonal terms remain small and that the network structure is determined by the most frequent recent patterns .",
    "alternatively , instead of the decay term , we might use a normalization method and the connection structure would depend on the weighted effect of all the data .    in the operating mode described above the network acts as a _ signal identifier_. for example",
    "if the signal patterns are random , there is little correlation established and all the units operate near the feigenbaum point . alternatively the learning process may be stopped at a certain time and the network then used as a _ pattern recognizer_. in this latter mode , whenever the pattern \\{@xmath104 } appears , one makes the replacement @xmath107 therefore if @xmath11 was @xmath108 but either @xmath104 or @xmath109 is @xmath110 then @xmath111 .",
    "that is , the correlation between node @xmath92 and @xmath112 disappears and the effect of this connection on the lowering of the periods vanishes .",
    "if both @xmath113 and @xmath114 are one , then @xmath115 and the effect of this connection persists .",
    "suppose however that for all the @xmath10 s different from zero either @xmath113 or @xmath114 are equal to zero .",
    "then the correlations are totally destroyed and the network comes back to the uncorrelated ( nonperiodic behavior ) .",
    "this case is what is called a _",
    "novelty filter_. conversely , by displaying periodic behavior , the network _ recognizes _ the patterns that are similar to those that , in the learning stage , determined its connection structure . recognition and _",
    "association _ of similar patterns is then performed .",
    "a numerical simulation was made for a network of @xmath116 units . during a learning phase a single binary pattern @xmath117",
    "was presented many times to the network , the network connections evolving according to the correlation learning method ( eq.([3.8 ] ) ) and a normalization prescription .",
    "after the learning phase , the connections @xmath11 are considered to be frozen and we have tested the reaction of the network to several other patterns . in this recall phase , to present a pattern to the network means to make the replacements of eqs.([3.9 ] ) and to let the system evolve from a random initial condition . as the system might be sensible to the initial conditions , we choose the same initial conditions for all patterns .",
    "the results are shown in fig.2 .",
    "each pattern leaves a unique signature given by the set of periods to which each unit converges .",
    "the periods in each unit are measured after a transient delay of @xmath118 time steps .    in fig.2",
    "the first pattern that is presented to the network is the one that was memorized .",
    "the others are chosen in the following way :    - the second is the complementary binary pattern to the one that was memorized .",
    "this pattern being non - correlated to the learned pattern , the network units become uncoupled and only very high periods are seen .    - for the remaining patterns",
    "some bits are swapped ( from @xmath119 to @xmath120 ) in the complementary pattern , forming new signals which are weakly correlated with the memorized one .",
    "the bit swapping structure is listed in table ii .",
    "the signature of the correlations is seen from the low periods that appear in some of the network units ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the color map is the same as used in sect .",
    "@xmath121    table ii",
    "for its dynamical diversity and the selective stabilization effect of the couplings , feigenbaum networks , both with few and with many units , seem to be a potentially interesting system for signal processing through complex dynamics and to model self - organization .    as seen in sect.2 , the size of the basins of attraction of the sinks created by the coupling is controlled by the geometry of the pre - existing unstable periodic orbits and , as a consequence , are extremely small for large periods .",
    "it might therefore be useful for practical applications to be able to control the dynamics in a more efficient way .",
    "this implies departures from the simple linear coupling scheme of eq.([1.1 ] ) .",
    "for example we might use @xmath122 with @xmath123 or the smooth version @xmath124 for small couplings this leads to a much larger shift to smaller values of the @xmath97 discussed in sect.3 .",
    "alternatively we might think of using other maps , which also possess an infinite diversity of periodic behaviors .",
    "consider for example a piecewise - linear dynamics for the units ( @xmath125 ( mod.@xmath126 ) .",
    "for @xmath127 the uncoupled dynamics is fully chaotic .",
    "however , through interaction , it is possible to select and stabilize an infinite number of periodic orbits . consider a fully connected network with dynamics @xmath128 with @xmath104 in the interval @xmath129 .",
