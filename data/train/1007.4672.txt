    "tunneling of particles through wells and barriers is a distinctive property of quantum mechanics , commonly exploited in the realization of solid - state devices @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization and manipulation of ultracold atoms @xcite in double- and many- well potentials makes possible to study tunneling dynamics of fermions and bosons in an highly controllable setup , in which it is possible to tune the geometrical properties of the wells , and then the tunneling rate of the particles . for ultracold bosons , the coherent josephson oscillations of a bose - einstein condensate in a double well potential were discussed @xcite and subsequently experimentally observed @xcite ; the dynamics of bosonic squeezed states has been as well investigated @xcite . for large enough barriers between the two wells",
    ", a two - mode ansatz can be used to describe the tunneling dynamics : for bosonic condensates , the two - mode equations can be mapped in a non - rigid pendulum @xcite and can also generalized to many - well potentials @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the study of ultracold fermi gases has known a great advance through the last years @xcite and the impressive experimental progresses in their control make fermi gases very promising to realize ultracold fermionic junctions and to study tunneling phenomena . due to the possibility to use optical lattices @xcite and to tune the interspecies interaction through feshbach resonances @xcite , the fermionic tunneling can be studied in situations having a direct counterpart in solid - state tunnel junctions . when the fermi gases in different wells are superfluid ( due to attractive interaction among species ) one has the ultracold fermionic equivalent of a superconductor - insulator - superconductor junction @xcite , having coherent tunneling : theoretical studies of tunneling of fermionic superfluids through barriers @xcite and in double- and many- well potentials @xcite have been reported in literature , as well as the study of the internal josephson tunneling between different species @xcite ( see more references in @xcite ) .    at variance",
    ", one can also realize the ultracold atomic counterpart of one or more _ normal _ tunnel junctions @xcite when the temperature of the fermi mixture in a double- or many- well potential is above the superfluid critical temperature ( in presence of attractive interactions ) or , even at zero temperature , when the fermi gases in the wells are in the normal state .",
    "the latter situation can be obtained polarizing above a critical threshold a two - component fermi mixture @xcite or simply using spin polarized fermions @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the center - of - mass motion of a polarized fermi gas in a combined periodic and harmonic potential was theoretically and experimentally investigated , showing an insulating regime when the fermi energy lies into the bandgap of the lattice : working in tight - binding approximation , the dynamics of the polarized gas was studied solving the classical liouville equation , allowing for the characterization of the different regimes of the center - of - mass dynamics of the 3d fermi gas @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the tunneling dynamics of an ideal ( spin polarized ) fermionic gas in double well potentials .",
    "of course , unlike condensed bose gases where a large number of particles are in the same state moving coherently , for polarized fermions the dynamics displays in general an incoherent motion of the particles in the external potential .",
    "the situation is analogous to the incoherent tunneling of electrons between normal metals in the approximation where they are considered free particles : the application of a constant voltage creates a difference in the chemical potential and the more energetic electrons can tunnel through the barrier . for fermi gases an imbalance in the chemical potential",
    "can be either obtained by making asymmetric the double well potential ( with the two wells having different potential minima ) or creating an imbalance in the number of particles between the two wells of the system at the initial time : in this paper we will focus on the latter situation .",
    "because of pauli principle , fermions occupy all the doublets of the double well potential up to the fermi energy : since in general fermions in different doublets tunnel with different frequencies , then a dephasing in the current flowing among the wells may arise .",
    "this is what happens in the 1d case @xcite : the transverse degrees of freedom are frozen , since the distances between different doublets of the 1d double well potential are much smaller than the confining frequencies in the transverse directions .",
    "the tunneling dynamics then shows strongly aperiodic spatio - temporal patterns @xcite : for large number of fermions , current oscillations are practically washed out .",
    "rabi oscillations of a degenerate fermionic gas in a double well potential has been studied in @xcite in relation to the possibility to exploit them for the interferometric measurement of external forces at micrometer length scales .    however , for a relatively large number of fermions ( say @xmath0 ) , the validity of 1d limit requires very large confining transverse frequencies @xmath1 : indeed , as we will discuss in section ii , if one has an energy barrier @xmath2 between the wells and the minima of the wells are at distance @xmath3 , then the energy difference between the doublets is @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 and @xmath6 the mass of the fermionic atom ) .",
    "the condition for which the transverse degrees of freedom are frozen is then @xmath7 . for a realistic",
    "double well potential @xcite one has @xmath8 and @xmath9 : with @xmath6 the mass of potassium ( @xmath10 ) atoms , one gets @xmath11 , corresponding to transverse frequencies @xmath12 .",
    "one then sees that for typical transverse frequencies one has to take into account the transverse degrees of freedom .    in",
    "the following we consider a realistic 3d double well , obtained superimposing an harmonic confinement with a periodic potential : properly tuning the parameters , one can have two wells much more populated than the others @xcite .",
    "we provide estimates of the tunneling rates and of the occupation of the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , we show that it is realistically possible to have only the first doublet occupied : this corresponds to the condition @xmath13 , showing the role played by the transverse degrees of freedom in providing a reservoir to store particles and resulting in oscillations of a large number of particles with the same frequency .",
    "we stress that these are incoherent single - particle oscillations .",
    "then , if the 1d condition is violated the simple observation of a sinusoidal current can not discriminate between incoherent and coherent tunneling dynamics ( the latter being expected when the weakly coupled fermi gases are superfluids ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we analyze the structure of levels for a 3d fermi gas in a double well potential obtained by the superposition of an harmonic confinement and an 1d optical lattice . in this section",
    "we also provide estimates for the number of doublets and the occupation of transverse eigenstates in a realistic setup . in section iii",
    "we discuss the equations of motion for the dynamics in a 3d double well , and we show how the 1d limit , studied in @xcite , is retrieved . in section",
    "iv we study the dynamics of the fermi gas in the 3d double well potential described in section ii , showing how oscillations characterized by a single frequency can arise and studying deviations due to the occupation of higher doublets .",
    "finally in section v we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we study the structure of levels and their filling by a fermi gas in a 3d double well potential .",
    "to fix the ideas , we focus on the double well potential obtained by superimposing an harmonic confinement and a 1d optical lattice : when the energy of two minima of the periodic potential is significantly lower than the energies of other minima , due to the presence of the harmonic trap , then these wells are much more populated than the others and one practically has a double well . this way to realize the double",
    "well has been used to study the tunneling dynamics of ultracold bosons in a double well potential in @xcite and could be used also for fermi gases . the energy barrier and the distance between the wells",
    "are controlled by acting on the parameters of the optical lattice @xcite , while the number of doublets under barrier depends also on the trapping frequencies of the harmonic confinement . in the following",
    "we discuss how the fermions fill the doublet structure , keeping into account the transverse eigenstates .",
    "we will also study two relevant situations : the 1d limit with frozen transverse degrees of freedom and the limit ( which we refer as 3d ) in which the transverse frequency is so small that only few doublets of the double well potential are occupied .",
    "the trapping potential reads @xmath14 where the double well potential along the @xmath15-axis , @xmath16 , has the form @xmath17 in ( [ double_potential ] ) , the 1d optical lattice is created by two counterpropagating laser beams : it is @xmath5 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the wavelength of the lasers and @xmath20 the angle between the counterpropagating laser beams @xcite .",
    "the spacing in the lattice is @xmath3 , and @xmath2 is proportional to the power of the laser ; moreover , @xmath21 and @xmath1 are respectively the axial and transverse frequencies of the harmonic confinement .",
    "typical experimental numbers are @xmath22 and @xmath23 : for @xmath24 , the energy barrier ( needed to have tunneling dynamics ) is @xmath25 @xcite . in the following we set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the recoil energy , and we also introduce the ratio @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the harmonic oscillator length in the @xmath15-direction .    .",
    "we used the values @xmath30 hz , @xmath31 and @xmath32 corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "dashed lines : harmonic potential around the minima of the original potential with effective frequency @xmath35 . ]    for suitable ranges of the parameters , the potential ( [ v_tot ] ) is to a very good approximation a double well potential , as it is shown in fig.[potential ] where we fixed the value of the frequency of the harmonic trapping along the @xmath15-direction .",
    "the potential @xmath36 , rescaled in terms of @xmath37 , reads : @xmath38 the first two minima of the potential which identify the position of the double well minima are given by the solution of the transcendental equation @xmath39 one sees that for large values of the denominator in the r.h.s . of eq.([v_dw ] ) - i.e. for large energy barriers , @xmath40 - the first two minima are very close to @xmath41 . expanding the potential around these minima we get the effective trapping frequency @xmath42 the energy difference between ( neighbour in energy )",
    "doublets is then @xmath43 .",
    "this frequency then allows to estimate the mean energy and the number of doublets under the potential barrier @xmath2 . in general",
    "the splitting of doublets increases when the energy of the doublets increases .",
    "a first estimation of the splitting of each doublet can be performed by means of a semiclassical computation @xcite : in appendix we report semiclassical estimations of the energy and the splitting of the doublets .    in fig.[doublets ] we plot the potential and the position of the doublets for specific values of the parameters . in fig.[lambda_v0 ] we plot the number of doublets for the potential of eq.([v_dw ] ) for different values of @xmath2 ( in units of @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 obtained from the solution of the time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "we observe that for a fixed ratio @xmath46 there is a finite range of values of @xmath2 : for @xmath2 smaller than a critical value @xmath47 the central barrier is not high enough to contain any doublet . for large values of @xmath2 , the nearest energy minima ( located , for @xmath40 , close to @xmath48 )",
    "have an energy smaller than the potential energy at the top of the barrier , which is @xmath49 , and then the double well structure disappears . from the condition",

    "the double well has three doublets under the central barrier ; the upper solid line correspond to the symmetric energetic level of the third doublet ; the dashed one to the antisymmetric level .",

    "fermions begin to occupy the levels of the double well potential along @xmath15 ; the number of fermions is given by two times the number of doublets .",
    "the opposite 3d limit is obtained when @xmath62 in this limit , all the particles stay in the first doublet , occupying the transverse eigenstates associated to the doublet eigenstates .",
    "more precisely , to accommodate all the particles in the first doublet , two conditions must be satisfied at the same time : the energy difference between the first and the second doublet states ( @xmath43 ) must be much larger than the energy of the transverse modes ( @xmath63 ) and the transverse trapping frequency @xmath1 must be much smaller than @xmath21 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath64 , then the two conditions @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( needed to have a double well structure ) can not be at the same satisfied . finally , we notice that if @xmath67 then higher doublets can be occupied and situations intermediate between the 1d and 3d limits can be explored .    before studying the 3d double well potential ( [ v_tot ] ) ,",
    "let us consider a 2d potential of the form @xmath68 the number of particles which can be placed on a side of the double well in the first doublet is then given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the energy difference between the first and the second doublet : @xmath71 is the energy of a symmetric ( @xmath72 ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath73 ) state of the first ( @xmath74 ) or second ( @xmath75 ) doublet .",
    "for very large barriers , then @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "if the energy of a state in the second doublet is larger than the @xmath77 than the number of particles that it is possible to store up to the barrier height is given by : @xmath78    in three dimensions the number of particles which can be stored is even larger thanks to the degeneracy of the transverse degrees of freedom .",

    "then the total number of particles which can be stored on a side of the double well in the first doublet is given by : @xmath86 when the energy of the second doublet is larger than @xmath87 then as for the 2d case , @xmath88 must be replaced by @xmath89 . these results can be extended to higher doublets by simply substituting @xmath88 by @xmath90 .",
    "in this section we review the formalism to describe the dynamics of a system of polarized fermions in a 3d double well potential of the form eq.([v_tot ] ) .",
    "the 1d limit , studied in @xcite , is retrieved and briefly discussed ; we refer also to @xcite for a study of the effects of the boson - fermion interactions when a localized bose - einstein condensates is placed in the wells .",

    "the eigenenergies of the single - particle hamiltonian are given by @xmath100 .",
    "the fermionic field can be written as @xmath101 . since we want to study the dynamics of particles in the double well potential we decompose each pair of eigenfunctions corresponding to the same doublet into its right and left component : @xmath102\\ ] ] where the ( wannier ) wavefunctions @xmath103 centered in the wells @xmath104 are given as usual by @xmath105 we will as well use the notations @xmath106 for the eigenfunctions of the single - particle hamiltonian and @xmath107 for the 3d wannier wavefunctions .",
    "the fermionic operators @xmath108 are defined as : @xmath109 the hamiltonian ( [ 3dh ] ) then reads @xmath110 the density operator of particles along the direction of the double well is given by : @xmath111    when we average the density operator over a generic state with a definite number of particles on the left and right part of the barrier the off - diagonal elements of the density operator give a null contribution .",
    "then , in order to describe the evolution of the system , we write the equation for the dynamics of the diagonal elements only : @xmath112 and similarly for @xmath113 . finally one easily obtains : @xmath114 we introduce the quantity @xmath115 which is the particle difference in the doublet @xmath116 between the right and the left sides of the double well for a generic initial state @xmath117 ( given an operator @xmath118 , we use the notation @xmath119 ) .",
    "next we define the total _ population imbalance _",
    "@xmath120 for the n - th doublet : @xmath121 the total _",
    "fractional _ population imbalance @xmath122 is then defined as @xmath123    from eqs.([number ] ) , @xmath124 evolves according to : @xmath125 this equation has the straightforward solution : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the rabi frequency for the oscillation of a particle into the same doublet and @xmath128 depend in general on the initial conditions .",
    "for a single particle in the doublet @xmath129 , the initial state @xmath130 can be in general be written in the bloch sphere as @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath128 are the coordinates on the bloch sphere : when the particle is initially in the state @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , then @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) .",

    "however the experimental situation we have in mind is a system of two identical wells initially practically decoupled ( i.e. , with a very high energy barrier between them ) with a definite number of particles ( say @xmath140 and @xmath141 , with @xmath142 ) in each side in their ground state .",
    "then , at the initial time @xmath143 the barrier along the @xmath15 direction is lowered and the system is left to evolve freely with the hamiltonian ( [ 3dh ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one could start from the ground state of a symmetric 3d double well and tilt for some time the double well , so that the energy minima of the double well potential are different and particles flow toward the energetically favoured well : removing abruptly the tilted potential one has an initial state with a different number of particles in the two wells .    for sufficiently high barriers the first @xmath140 particles will be frozen in the two wells , while the others will start to tunnel .",
    "take as initial state for one of such particles in the right side @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the quantum numbers along the transverse directions which remain unperturbed and @xmath147 labels the states along the longitudinal @xmath15-axis before the barrier gets lowered ; then the initial state @xmath148 can be well approximated by @xmath149 therefore we decide to study the evolution of the system of an arbitrary number of fermions under the conditions that the initial state of each particle is of the type @xmath150 to have a reasonable description of the dynamics .",
    "if , for instance , we suppose all the particles in the n - th doublet initially on the right well the phases @xmath128 can be taken equal to zero and the number of particles in each side of the barrier read : @xmath151 @xmath152      in the 1d limit the transverse degrees of freedom are frozen and fermions belonging to different doublets oscillates with different frequencies : this case been studied in detail in @xcite . in fig.[one_dynamics ] we plot the evolution of the total fractional population imbalance @xmath122 for few particles ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) . in the last plot",
    "we draw the same quantity for @xmath155 in a square double well potential ( we made this choice since for the potential like ( [ v_dw ] ) one can not have hundreds of doublets below the barrier for realistic values of the parameters ) .",
    "we parametrized the square double well potential with infinite walls as @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the width of the square double well and @xmath158 , @xmath159 dimensionless parameters .",
    "one sees that already for hundreds of particles the current oscillations are practically washed out for an initial imbalance not too small .     for a 1d double well ( [ double_potential ] ) : in a ) there are @xmath160 fermions initially on the right side and @xmath161 on the left side , in b ) @xmath162 on the right and @xmath161 on the left and in c ) @xmath163 on the right and @xmath74 on the left .",

    "as we can infer from these examples , oscillations follow an aperiodic motion due to the superposition of many different incommensurate oscillations ; moreover , since rabi frequencies for distant levels can be very different , the time scale required for a complete oscillation of the population imbalance @xmath122 can be much larger than the experimental observation times .",
    "in this section we consider the dynamics of polarized fermions in the 3d confining potential ( [ v_tot ] ) when the 1d validity condition is violated , as it happens for realistic transverse confining potentials .    as discussed in section ii",
    ", the number of particles which can be stored in one doublet can be very much increased by taking a weak confinement in the transverse direction thanks to the possibility to fill the transverse states before reaching the next doublet . in fig.[025 ] we consider the range of parameters @xmath172 such that the double well potential ( [ v_dw ] ) has only a doublet under barrier and we plot in this range the maximum number @xmath173 of particles which can be stored in that ( first ) doublet : in other words , for a number of atoms @xmath174 they start to occupy levels above the top of the barrier .",

    "<S> we study the tunneling of a spin polarized fermi gas in a three - dimensional double well potential , focusing on the time dynamics starting from an initial state in which there is an imbalance in the number of particles in the two wells . although fermions in different doublets of the double well tunnel with different frequencies , we point out that ( incoherent ) oscillations of a large number of particles can arise , as a consequence of the presence of transverse degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the doublet structure and of the occupation of transverse eigenstates for a realistic experimental setup are provided . </S>"
