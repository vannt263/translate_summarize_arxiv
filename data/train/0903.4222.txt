    "the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) is an interacting particle system with diffusion , pair annihilation ( @xmath10 ) , and creation of offspring by pairs ( @xmath11 )  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the pcpd scaling is definitely distinct from the directed percolation ( dp ) scaling in two dimensions and higher . however , for the one dimensional pcpd , there is still no consensus on its critical scaling with two different viewpoints such as the dp scaling after an extremely long crossover time  @xcite and the new scaling distinct from the dp  @xcite . since the critical exponents of the pcpd are so similar to those of the dp in one dimension and the strong corrections to scaling are present , it would be difficult , if not impossible , to settle down the controversy via direct numerical simulations of the pcpd . on this account , the authors suggested two critical tests in the past .",
    "one is the driven pcpd ( dpcpd )  @xcite and the other is the crossover  @xcite .",
    "a recent brief review on these two approaches is available in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we continue to investigate the crossover behavior of the pcpd to other universality classes , in order to understand further the difference between the pcpd and the dp .",
    "it is well established that the critical behavior of the pcpd is not affected by introducing modulo 2 ( parity ) conservation of the total particle number  @xcite .",
    "that is , even if a pair branches two offspring ( @xmath0 ) rather than one , this model is believed to share the critical behavior with the pcpd and does not belong to the directed ising ( di )  @xcite or the parity - conserving ( pc ) class  @xcite . in the context of the crossover",
    ", however , the parity - conserving pcpd provides a useful platform to study rich crossover behaviors compared to the non - conserving pcpd . because of the special role of the parity conservation",
    ", we will refer to the parity - conserving pcpd as pcpd2 in this paper .",
    "the term pcpd will be preserved to refer to the universality class in what follows .",
    "we introduce a single - particle branching process in the pcpd2 to study the crossover behavior from the pcpd to other universality classes .",
    "depending on the number of offspring in the single - particle process , one can study the crossover either to the dp ( by @xmath4 ) as in ref .",
    "@xcite , or to the di ( by @xmath12 ; see sec .",
    "[ sub : pcpd - di ] ) .",
    "since the pcpd is clearly independent from the di class , we expect a nontrivial crossover scaling from the pcpd to the di",
    ". however , this crossover scaling may not be independent from the pcpd - to - dp crossover scaling , if the pcpd universality class can be described by a well - defined fixed point and the parity conservation is irrelevant to the pcpd fixed point .    as discussed in our previous work  @xcite and also in sec .",
    "[ sub : pcpd - di ] , the crossover scaling depends only on the initial fixed point and its crossover operator , but not directly on the terminal fixed point .",
    "the initial pcpd fixed point is blind to the parity conservation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the pcpd point of view , the crossover operators associated with @xmath4 and @xmath2 may be undistinguishable , and thus have the same scaling dimension .",
    "hence , we expect the same crossover exponent for the pcpd - to - dp and the pcpd - to - di crossover scaling , which is numerically confirmed in sec .",
    "[ sub : pcpd - di ] .",
    "the terminal fixed point ( dp or di ) , of course , depends crucially on the existence of the parity conservation in the reaction dynamics .",
    "more complex reaction - diffusion models with hybrid - type dynamics may be considered such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these models are numerically shown  @xcite and reasonably argued [ see sec .",
    "v in ref .",
    "@xcite ] to belong to the dp in one dimension when @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in contrast to the cases of @xmath17 ( pcpd at @xmath18 and tcpd at @xmath19  @xcite ) .",
    "the crossover from the diffusing tp12 @xmath20 to the dp by adding a single - particle reaction ( @xmath21 ) has been studied previously  @xcite to find the typical `` crossover '' behavior between the identical ( dp ) universality classes as expected : a linear phase boundary and no diverging time scale . in this paper , we study the crossover from the diffusing tp22 @xmath22 with the parity conservation to the di by adding @xmath12 . a nontrivial crossover exponent for this dp - to - di crossover is numerically estimated , which is different from the pcpd - to - di crossover exponent .",
    "this finding again supports the distinct nature of the pcpd scaling from the dp .",
    "when @xmath23 is added to tp22 , we again observe the trivial crossover between the identical ( dp ) classes .",
    "one may question how the tp22 can distinguish the crossover operators associated with @xmath23 and @xmath12 , in contrast to the pcpd .",
    "the answer is simply that the parity conservation at the level of single - particle reactions is relevant to the dp fixed point , but not to the pcpd fixed point .",
    "this again further supports the difference between the dp and the pcpd fixed point even in one dimension .",
    "the parity conservation in one dimension makes it possible to map the pcpd2to the nonequilibrium ising spin dynamics with the @xmath24 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "although this mapping can be considered nominal due to the irrelevance of the parity conservation in the pcpd , one can still ask a question regarding the effect of the symmetry breaking field in the dual spin language . in terms of the original particle ( kink ) language , it implies an alternating directional bias in diffusion ( or branching ) of particles , which makes a pair of neighboring particles tightly bound .",
    "then we can easily expect a simple dp - type dynamics of bound pairs ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , with the symmetry breaking field , we may find a new independent route from the pcpd to the dp , which is characterized by a new crossover exponent .",
    "( similar independent routes are discussed for the di - to - dp crossover in ref .",
    "this is also confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : mod2 ] introduces the dynamic rules of the pcpd2and shows that the pcpd2shares the critical behavior with its cousin without conservation ( pcpd ) . by introducing the relative bias between isolated particles and pairs , the pcpd2exhibits the same critical scaling as in the dpcpd . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we introduce the three crossover models by adding a single - particle reaction process to the pcpd2 and to tp22 , and by adding an alternating directional bias to the pcpd2 , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , the extensive numerical results are presented for these three models . finally , the conclusion and the summary of the results follow in sec .  [",
    "sec : sum ] .",
    "this section begins with the description of the pcpd2dynamics adopted for simulations , and then reconfirms the pcpd behavior of the pcpd2 .",
    "the dynamic rules for the pcpd2are as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) stands for an occupied ( vacant ) site and the parameters on the top of arrows represent the transition rates . for convenience , we set @xmath30 with @xmath31 . except the biased branching model ( see below ) , @xmath32 is set in most cases .",
    "each site can carry at most one particle ( hard core exclusion ) .",
    "the pcpd2has been shown numerically to belong to the pcpd class  @xcite .",
    "this may be understood by viewing the pcpd - type models as a coupled system of two particle species , where a particle pair corresponds to an @xmath33 particle and a solitary particle to a @xmath34 particle  @xcite .",
    "then , the pcpd dynamics is the combination of the dp - like dynamics of @xmath33 s and the binary annihilation diffusing dynamics of @xmath34 s .",
    "the two species are coupled through transmutations .",
    "the only difference in the pcpd2 dynamics from the pcpd is the number of offspring in branching of @xmath33 particles such as @xmath25 in the pcpd and @xmath35 in the pcpd2 , which should be irrelevant in the dp dynamics of @xmath33 s with no parity conservation by @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising to find the pcpd2 in the pcpd class .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically study the pcpd2 with directional bias and check whether it shares the same critical behavior with the driven pcpd ( dpcpd )  @xcite .",
    "this may serve as another evidence supporting that the parity conservation in the pcpd2 is irrelevant .",
    "being relevant the relative bias between isolated particles and pairs , the biased branching as well as the biased diffusion should entail the change of the universality class  @xcite .",

    "the monte carlo simulation begins with a random selection of a particle among @xmath77 particles at time @xmath45 .",
    "let us denote the site on which the chosen particle resides by @xmath78 . with probability @xmath79 , we choose one of the direction ( left or right ) which will be denoted by @xmath80 .",

    "are newly placed at two nearest neighbors of the site @xmath78 , only if the @xmath84-th site is also vacant . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath81-th site is already occupied , both particles are removed from the system with probability @xmath46 or with probability @xmath85 , we choose two sites in a row , that is , either ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) or ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) with equal probability and branch two particles there once both sites are empty . if any of the conditions stated above is not satisfied , nothing happens .",
    "after the above attempt , time increases by @xmath90 .      for comparison , we introduce a crossover model from the dp to the di to check the difference of the pcpd and the dp in the crossover behavior to the di via the same operation @xmath91 . to this end",
    ", we need a dp - type model with the parity conservation .",
    "one example is the diffusing tp22with @xmath5 and @xmath10 . including @xmath12 , the process @xmath5 becomes irrelevant as in the pcpd2 and the model belongs to the di class .",
    "we refer to this model as the dp - di .",
    "the algorithm is identical to the pcpd - diexcept the triplet branching process : if the @xmath81-th site is occupied , then with probability @xmath85 we look up the nearest - neighbor site of the pair in the right ( site @xmath92 ) .",
    "if this site is occupied , two particles are generated at nearest neighbors of this triplet , in case both nearest neighbor sites are vacant .      finally , we consider an alternating diffusion bias in the one dimensional pcpd2 .",
    "all particles diffuse with bias in one direction or the other , and neighboring particles have opposite directional bias .",
    "neighboring particles may be separated by an arbitrary stretch of empty sites .",
    "if a particle hops to the right with rate @xmath93 and to the left with @xmath94 , then the hopping rates for neighboring particles are just reversed . as the particles are created or annihilated pairwise locally in eq .",
    "and the hardcore repulsion prevents the crossing of particles , each particle can preserve the bias direction and the alternating diffusion bias in the system is still intact during the dynamics .",
    "therefore , one may identify particles with different bias as different species of particles .",
    "for example , one may name a particle with diffusion bias to the right as an @xmath28 particle and a particle with diffusion bias to the left as a @xmath95 particle .",
    "then the @xmath96 ordering is preserved if one starts with a configuration with the @xmath96 ordering under the dynamics of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 mimicing the pcpd2 dynamics . without bias ( @xmath101 ) ,",
    "two species are indistinguishable and we recover the pcpd2 .    at @xmath102",

    ", all particles form @xmath96 bound pairs which can not split once bound . afterwards",
    ", any diffusion is impossible and the dynamics becomes identical to the contact process ( cp ) of @xmath26 and @xmath25 with @xmath104 . for finite @xmath83 , the biased diffusion will dominate in large scales and all particles form a little bit loose but still bound @xmath96 pairs .",
    "thus we expect the same critical behavior as in the case @xmath103 .",
    "since the cp belongs to the dp class , so does the model with @xmath102 .",
    "we emphasize that the fundamental difference between the pcpd and the dp lies in this pair binding property .",

    "@xmath95 particle represent a @xmath106 and @xmath107 domain wall , respectively .",
    "the alternating bias in diffusion can be interpreted as a symmetry - breaking ( sb ) field favoring @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) for @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "so we may call the pcpd2 with finite @xmath83 as the symmetry - broken pcpd2(sbpcpd ) . the crossover scaling property by the symmetry - breaking ( or pair - binding ) route may be different from the conventional one observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , similar to various independent routes found in the di - to - dp crossover  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the conventional crossover is also found by a single - particle reaction process @xmath112 breaking the parity conservation in the pcpd2 .",
    "we remark that the alternating bias ( symmetry - breaking field ) in the baw2 also makes two neighboring particles form a bound pair , which triggers the crossover from the di to the dp .",
    "therefore the pair - binding process is the common underlying mechanism for the sb routes of the di - to - dp and the pcpd - to - dp crossover .",

    "<S> the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) with modulo 2 conservation ( pcpd2 ) [ @xmath0 , @xmath1 is studied in one dimension , focused on the crossover to other well established universality classes : the directed ising ( di ) and the directed percolation ( dp ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show that the pcpd2shares the critical behaviors with the pcpd , both with and without directional bias . </S>",
    "<S> second , the crossover from the pcpd2to the di is studied by including a parity - conserving single - particle process ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find the crossover exponent @xmath3 , which is argued to be identical to that of the pcpd - to - dp crossover by adding @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the pcpd universality class has a well defined fixed point distinct from the dp . </S>",
    "<S> third , we study the crossover from a hybrid - type reaction - diffusion process belonging to the dp [ @xmath5 , @xmath1 to the di by adding @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath6 for the dp - to - di crossover . </S>",
    "<S> the inequality of @xmath7 and @xmath8 further supports the non - dp nature of the pcpd scaling . finally , we introduce a symmetry - breaking field in the dual spin language to study the crossover from the pcpd2to the dp . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath9 , which is associated with a new independent route from the pcpd to the dp . </S>"
