    "natural systems exhibit a great diversity of complex patterns .",
    "it has been argued that the origins of such complexity can be captured by mathematical models known as _ cellular automata _ ( ca ) @xcite .",
    "these models consist of a large number of units that can take a finite number of states and evolve according to simple rules . even in the simplest cases of two - state units and nearest neighbor rules , cas exhibit remarkable properties at the aggregate level .",
    "since their invention by ulam and von neumann , it has been known that these systems are capable of supporting universal computations @xcite . a well - known example of such behavior is conway s `` game of life '' @xcite .",
    "this is a two - state 2-dimensional ca which is capable , among many other things , of implementing a turing machine @xcite . not",
    "every ca possesses these properties .",
    "a more recent study by langton suggests that cellular automata that are capable of supporting universal computation ( aka .",
    "class iv cas ) are typically found in special values of the parameters for which there is a phase transition into chaotic behavior @xcite .",
    "because of their computational properties , cas have been extensively utilized to model biological phenomena despite their discrete nature ( for a review see ermentrout et . al @xcite ) . in this article",
    "i introduce a model of coupled oscillators whose spatio - temporal dynamics share many features with those of cas and may therefore provide insight into the dynamical mechanisms by which complexity arises in systems composed of oscillatory units .",
    "rhythmic phenomena are ubiquitous across nature",
    ". oscillations in physical , biological , and chemical systems can be expressed mathematically as periodic solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "when autonomous oscillators interact with an external signal they adjust their amplitudes and phases . under weak coupling assumptions",
    "the amplitudes remain relatively constant and the oscillators can be described by phase equations @xcite .",
    "this notion is useful in understanding the effect of interactions in large sets of oscillatory units , most notably in the kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "the study of interactions in networks of oscillators has recently received increased attention due to a breakthrough by ott et .",
    "al that allows us to obtain analytic results on the average properties of large sets of globally coupled phase oscillators @xcite .",
    "however , this does not apply to the case in which the interactions are local and this is consequently an area of intense research .",
    "phase oscillators are widely utilized to study interactions in assemblies of oscillators because they can capture the dynamical features of a complicated nonlinear oscillator while being more amenable to analytic inquiry .    while it is generally accepted that periodic autonomous processes underlie the coordination of biological processes , the question of how such coordinated behavior emerges out of the aggregate activity of many oscillating units is a matter of active research with a long history @xcite . despite major advances in the characterization of the constituent units of life ,",
    "much of the complexity we see in the biological world springs from the interaction of many units .",
    "important developments in the experimental investigation of biological networks support the tantalizing possibility that biological system poise themselves at or near critical points @xcite .",
    "these states are characterized by power law distributions of observable quantities , long - range correlations , and are typically associated with phase transitions .",
    "a beautiful example was derived from quantitative measurements of flocks of birds .",
    "while flocks travel coherently with a well - defined mean velocity , fluctuations over this mean level are correlated over long distances .",
    "the statistical properties of the flock can be explained quantitatively by minimally structured models whose parameters can be inferred from data , and are found to be in a critical regime @xcite . despite the interactions being local , long - range correlations in the critical regime allow for the propagation of information across distant sites .",
    "recently , a connection between statistical and dynamical criticality was introduced by magnasco et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "they consider an abstract model of neurons with dynamic anti - hebbian interactions which self - organizes towards a state that exhibits various long - tailed statistical behaviors .",
    "their model suggests that it is possible to achieve critical regimes by balancing excitation and inhibition , not just globally , but also in local patches .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explore the conditions under which smooth dynamical systems may perform computations .",
    "for this i present a remarkably simple model of coupled phase oscillators that , upon changes of the parameters , can display a multitude of patterns including traveling waves , spatio - temporal chaos , and most surprisingly , the emergence of long - lived complex structures reminiscent of those that occur in class iv cas .",
    "the model presented here shares several features with a recently introduced model of neural activity that produces similar emergent behavior @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : the model is presented in section ii and its solutions are described in section iii .",
    "section iv contains the conclusions and final remarks .",
    "the network consists of a uni - dimensional array of units with local interactions .",
    "the dynamics of the units is given by the adler s equation @xcite .",
    "this equation is widely utilized to model excitable oscillators and it captures the main dynamical features of an oscillator close to a saddle - node in limit cycle bifurcation ( snilc ) .",
    "alternatively , it can also be thought of as describing the phase difference of two oscillators coupled by their phase difference . in order for information to propagate efficiently through the network , excitation and inhibition have to be balanced in local patches .",
    "this is achieved in this model by following magnasco et .",
    "al , imposing antisymmetric interactions between neighboring units @xcite . here",
    "the state of the system can be specified by a @xmath1-dimensional vector @xmath2 and the dynamics can be expressed succinctly : @xmath3 in this notation the function cosine is applied to each component of vector @xmath2 , ie : @xmath4 ( @xmath5 $ ] ) .",
    "the natural frequency of the oscillators in the absence of the excitation term controlled by @xmath6 .",
    "the strength of the coupling is given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the connectivity matrix .",
    "this matrix couples the activity of neighboring units and contains the important assumption of balancing excitation and inhibition in local patches .",
    "this is achieved by antisymmetric interactions between units @xmath9 , and by arranging the units in an alternating fashion along a one - dimensional axis , ie : @xmath10 with this connectivity , any given unit is either purely excitatory or purely inhibitory .",
    "finally , we assume periodic boundary conditions by setting @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and choose a first - order coupling function for the interaction between units . for clarity , system [ model ]",

    "the system s solutions exhibit high values of @xmath19 . for values",

    "while for the cases @xmath54 , @xmath18 and @xmath55 a parameter can be eliminated by rescaling time , it is useful for the discussion to consider the limit cases given by @xmath56 , @xmath17 and @xmath15 .",
    "the choice of @xmath52 is useful to explore the case @xmath57 .",
    "the simulations were done using a standard runge - kutta o(4 ) routine with step @xmath58 .",
    "the observable activity is defined as @xmath59 and the complexity of the activity for each unit was quantified by the permutation entropy o(4 ) .",
    "this is a recently introduced measure of complexity for time series which is easy to implement , it is in good agreement with other indicators of dynamical complexity such as lyapunov exponents , and it is related to the dimension of the underlying attractor @xcite . here",
    "the entropy is defined as the mean value over all units @xmath60 .",
    "the system is evolved for a number @xmath61 of natural periods @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of steps per period . for the purposes of this article",
    "it is sufficient to determine the entropy up to o(-2 ) .",
    "the criteria for convergence is that for a given initial condition further increments of @xmath64 and @xmath65 yield differences of @xmath19 of order o(-3 ) .",
    "convergence of this quantity is achieved in the inspected range for values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 and in this work these values are set to @xmath68 and @xmath69 . with these choices the entropy yields the correct answer for the non - interacting case @xmath15 . when @xmath70 the units are limit cycles , the system dimension is exactly @xmath1 , and the entropy values are @xmath71 for all units .",
    "this is consistent with high values of @xmath19 because the solutions are random patterns of initial conditions . in the case",
    "@xmath70 the system s solutions decay to fixed points and `` forget '' their initial state , yielding entropy values @xmath72 , consistent with a smaller attractor dimension .",
    "finally , @xmath19 is similar for network sizes of @xmath73 .",
    "this parameter does not affect @xmath19 up to @xmath74 and it becomes important for determining the o(-2 ) location of finer structures in parameter space not discussed in this work .",
    "here @xmath19 was computed for a network size of @xmath75 so that the results presented here can be reproduced in about a day of computer work using a cluster of @xmath76 nodes with @xmath77 cores each .",

    "panel a shows the entropy as a function of the natural frequency for different values of the excitability @xmath6 , averaged over 10 initial conditions and @xmath78 neighboring values of @xmath14 .",

    "the non - excitable case ( @xmath17 ) is indicated by a bold line and the shaded region indicates the standard deviation .",
    "the dashed lines identify entropy values of interest : @xmath81 is the maximum entropy for @xmath18 , @xmath82 is chosen to highlight significant departures from @xmath17 , and @xmath83 chosen to aid visualization . while for the non - excitable case the entropy stays relatively constant around @xmath84 , when @xmath18 , @xmath19 takes a broader range of values between @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "these in turn are on average smaller than the case @xmath17 , thus in most cases of the inspected range excitability reduces entropy .",
    "a clear pattern emerges when the full range @xmath87 $ ] is explored as shown in panel b. the diagram indicates @xmath19 in colors and the lines correspond to iso - values of @xmath19 as determined by a marching squares algorithm taken at @xmath88 @xcite . in order to reveal broad features of this diagram ,",
    "@xmath19 was averaged over @xmath89 regions in @xmath90 space . for most values of the parameters",
    "the entropy is either low or high suggesting at least two broadly different dynamical regimes .",
    "however , it is important to note that for values near @xmath91 the entropy takes intermediate values .",
    "the diagram features a transition from low to high values of the entropy that becomes sharper and appears to approach the line @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "the system displays a multitude of spatio - temporal patterns , some of which are portrayed in panel ( c ) .",
    "the activity of each unit is indicated in colors ranging from blue = @xmath94 to red @xmath95 , and the labels indicate their locations in the phase diagram ( b ) . the activity was averaged over @xmath96 integration steps for visualization purposes .",
    "the values of the parameters and the entropy values are indicated in the figure label .",
    "the first observation is that for different values of the parameters , the amplitudes of the activity take different values yielding different colors .",
    "since the amplitude of the oscillators is @xmath97 , changes in the color correspond to changes in the frequency , thus different color bands correspond to different frequency bands .",
    "a second observation is that the activity of the odd units is different to that of the even units , which accounts for the vertical stripes in the patterns . in order to have at least @xmath98 of each kind for aesthetics , the simulations in ( c ) correspond to @xmath44 and where performed with fixed @xmath46 for reproducibility . for reference , solution ( 1 )",
    "displays an absorbing state in which all initial conditions decay to a fixed point .",
    "solution ( 0 ) corresponds to the critical state in the absence of excitability .",
    "complex behavior emerges robustly near the transition as depicted in ( 2 ) .",
    "the emergence of structures that interact and change on timescales much longer that the natural period is a robust feature of this system and can also be found for values away from @xmath91 as illustrated in solution ( 3 ) . however , the assertion that complex behavior can generally be found near the transition holds .",
    "these are patterns of activity that are neither trivial nor fully disordered and therefore correspond to intermediate values of the entropy . while in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the structures are local , in solution ( 7 ) all the units are engaged in nested patterns of activity which look self - similar .",
    "the finer structure of the phase diagram is harder to estimate numerically due to large fluctuations of the entropy values for different initial conditions .",
    "this is illustrated in solutions ( 4 ) where a small increment @xmath99 leads to patterns with different behaviors and entropies . in the leftmost case",
    "large structures propagate on a background of regular oscillations while in the right case the structures are long - lived but eventually fade to a non - trivial periodic pattern that is spatially inhomogeneous . a nearby solution closer to the transition",
    "is shown in ( 5 ) .",
    "it displays propagating activity similar to that in ( 2 ) but in the frequency band of solutions ( 4 ) yielding an orange background .",
    "the network can display traveling pulses as depicted in ( 6 ) .",
    "after a transient decay the activity settles on a set of pulses that travel with the same speed . as before , a small increment of @xmath100 leads to a radically different pattern which is solution ( 7 ) .",
    "this solution is similar to solution ( 6 ) but the activity is sparser and occurs in a different frequency band .",
    "finally , we note that in the absence of interactions the units display a @xmath101 bifurcation for @xmath57 .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate that in order to obtain complex behavior in a network of nonlinear oscillators with local interactions it is sufficient to assume that the the units are close to a @xmath101 bifurcation and that the interactions poise the system to a critical state .",
    "the results presented here are in direct agreement with the notion that the capacity to support computations is connected to phase transitions @xcite . while this was established for a parametric family of cellular automata it also holds in this continuum system where complex behavior is associated to intermediate values of the entropy . because of its simplicity , the model presented here is interesting from a purely mathematical perspective , but it also has potentially important engineering applications . while similar properties arise in cellular automata and models of neural networks , the fact that this behavior is achievable in a simple ode suggests that a physical implementation of this system is not only possible , but also scalable due to the system s many symmetries .",
    "the dynamics of the physical units utilized in present - day computers ultimately rely on some sort of bi - stability between the fixed points that correspond to the logical on and off states @xcite .",
    "analogously , in this system the units can be entrained into one of many stable periodic patterns suggesting the capacity to support many - state discrete functions .",
    "it is suggested that an electronic or physical implementation of the system presented here could be exploited to perform computations .",
    "the model presented here suggests interesting theoretical implications .",
    "the system can -for broad ranges of the parameter values- display dynamical patterns of activity which spread from traveling pulses to complex emergent structures .",
    "moreover , because the units of the system are phase oscillators the results presented here are applicable to any kind of oscillator for which a reduction to phase equations is possible .",
    "complex dynamics should occur robustly in systems of weakly interacting oscillators that meet two conditions : first , the units should present bifurcating limit cycles , and second , the system should be capable of supporting long - range correlations when the interactions are at play . in this model",
    "the first condition is met by assuming a non - zero first order term in the dynamics of the units and the second condition is achieved by assuming locally balanced , antisymmetric interactions . while there may be other choices for the interactions which could tune the system to a critical state",
    ", balancing excitation and inhibition locally is arguably a simple way to achieve this .",
    "this choice is motivated both by mathematical considerations and also because there is growing evidence that biological systems do operate in a critical regime @xcite .",
    "finally , both conditions were recently combined in a model for neural activity that yields similar phenomenology @xcite . in the brain , for instance",
    ", it is widely established that nervous processes rely upon local interactions of excitatory and inhibitory cells @xcite .",
    "brain cells are different from other cells in many regards , but most notably because of their intrinsic dynamical properties , which include the presence of several types of excitability and dynamical bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the results presented here suggest that such differentiated dynamics together with a local balance of excitation and inhibition are sufficient to support complex dynamical states .",
