    "a spin crisis arose when the first determination of @xmath1 was found to be much smaller than expected @xcite , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the polarized quark spin distribution functions .",
    "the recent value of the world average for @xmath4 is approximately @xmath5 .",
    "it is much smaller than the relativistic quark model prediction of 0.6 @xcite . among the number of explanations of the emc results on the longitudinally polarized proton structure function , that of the perturbative qcd approach occupies a prominent position and opens a new domain of tests @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in perturbative qcd predictions of the quark - parton model concerning the singlet axial charge contribution to @xmath6 need to be modified because of the @xmath7 anomaly of the flavour singlet current @xmath8 . in this approach",
    "the main question is the size of the polarized gluon distribution .",
    "but there is a great uncertainty in theoretical estimates on the magnitude and @xmath9dependence of @xmath10 , especially in the moderate @xmath9region @xmath11 .",
    "one calculation , performed in the framework of mit bag model , predicts negative @xmath10 value , thus even sharpening the problem @xcite .    in order to measure gluon contribution to the nucleon spin",
    ", we must select a process where the familiar lowest order graphs of deep inelastic scattering from a single quark are suppressed .",
    "analysis of the experimental data shows that there is no significant charm content in the nucleons @xcite .",
    "then one may hope to determine polarized gluon effects in the process of the charmed quark photoproduction .",
    "due to the comparatively large mass of the @xmath12quark the leading mechanism for obtaining a @xmath13- pair in the final state is the hard photon - gluon fusion ( pgf ) process @xmath14 and produced @xmath15 pair may form @xmath16 meson or fragment separately into open charm states .",
    "a rich spin physics programme was proposed by compass collaboration at cern @xcite . a large part of it is devoted to measurement of gluon polarization by tagging @xmath17-mesons produced in the @xmath18 collisions .",
    "produced @xmath17-mesons will be reconstructed from their two - and three - body decays into hadrons .",
    "it permits to impose constraints on the invariant masses of @xmath19 subsystems , which effectively rejects a background , especially in the case of @xmath20-tagging . a statistical precision on the polarization asymmetry measurement",
    "is expected to be about 0.05 .",
    "a proposal has been made @xcite to determine @xmath10 from the measurement of the asymmetry in the charm photoproduction process in the scattering of polarized real photons off polarized fixed target . in this paper",
    "we consider a possibility to realize this experiment at the tesla machine @xcite , and discuss briefly an opportunity to perform it at slac and lep2 .",
    "the scheme of the proposed experiment looks as follows .",
    "circularly polarized laser beam with photon energy @xmath21 ( cu15 laser ) is scattered off the @xmath22-electrons provided by tesla ( slac ) @xcite . throughout this subsection",
    "the numbers in parentheses refer to the slac gamma beam parameters .",
    "the compton back - scattered photon beam has a spectrum @xmath23 @xmath24 and follows closely to the trajectory of the primary electron beam . here",
    "the ratio of the hard photon energy @xmath25 to the electron energy @xmath26 ranges as @xmath27 had the laser beam been circularly polarized , the @xmath28-beam would be polarized too and the @xmath28-beam helicity is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the laser photon helicity . due to the unique dependence of both @xmath28-beam energy and polarization on the scattering angle @xmath31 between the incident and scattered photon @xmath32 it is possible to obtain almost monochromatic gamma beam with energy and polarization nearly equal to unit by selecting photons with @xmath33 . taking the distance between the conversion region and collimator @xmath34",
    ", we obtain that this angle corresponds to the diameter of the selecting slit @xmath35 .    in our further estimation on the luminosity of gamma beam scattering off a polarized fixed target",
    ", we shall follow to the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "we determine the optimal number of converted photons @xmath36 by the requirement to obtain one event per collision @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fraction of the photons coming through the slit , @xmath39 stands for the target nucleon density and @xmath40 is the total cross section of gamma - proton collisions . in the case of @xmath41 @xmath28-beam monochromaticity @xmath42 , for deuterated butanol target with the length about 40 @xmath43",
    "the density is @xmath44 and @xmath45 at high energies , so we get @xmath46 .",
    "because the number of electrons in a bunch @xmath47 for tesla ( slac ) , we obtain the necessary conversion coefficient @xmath48    the number of photons required to provide the scattering of each electron with the laser photon is defined from @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of photons in a laser pulse , @xmath51 is the total compton cross section and @xmath52 is the effective area of the photon and electron beams intercept .",
    "choosing @xmath53 , one can easily get the laser energy per pulse @xmath54 corresponding to the total electron conversion .",
    "since the optimal number of converted photons @xmath36 , defined by ( [ restr ] ) , is much less than @xmath55 , we need not the total conversion of electrons and the required pulse energy is suppressed by the factor of @xmath56 @xmath57 which is accessible with modern laser technology .",
    "finally we shall discuss a choice of the laser pulse frequency .",
    "it should evidently coincide with the linac frequency @xmath58 when number of the bunches @xmath59 in the electron beam is equal to unity . if the electron beam has a multybunch structure , one may either choose the repetition rate of laser pulses to be equal to @xmath60 or use a mirror system @xcite , which evidently decreases the laser pulse frequency . since the detailed discussion of an experimental setup is beyond the scope of our paper",
    ", we choose for simplicity the laser pulse frequency equal to @xmath61 .    for the linear accelerators the integrated luminosity per a year of operation takes the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the collision frequency .",
    "taking into account the eq.([restr ] ) , one can estimate @xmath64 as follows @xmath65    now we briefly consider the possibility to obtain the real gamma beam at a circular electron accelerator , say at lep2 .",
    "all calculations are done in analogy with the tesla case , except a few details .",
    "first of all , @xmath63 now takes the form @xmath66 where the number of electron bunches @xmath67 , @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath68 is the ring radius and @xmath58 is the circulation frequency in this case .",
    "it is evident that for the circular accelerator @xmath63 should coincide with frequency of the laser pulses .",
    "the next remark concerns the eq.([s_eff ] ) .",
    "we choose the effective area of the photon and electron beams intercept to be @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the transverse area of the lep2 electron beam , and the total compton cross section @xmath71 at the lep2 energy . and finally , we should take into account the effects of beam mean life time ( we did not consider these effects earlier , since every electron bunch provided by the linear accelerator could be used only once ) .",
    ".the parameters of the lep2 , slac and tesla electron beams . here",
    "@xmath72 is the pulse frequency , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the horizontal and vertical beam radius correspondingly , @xmath75 is the number of electrons per bunch and @xmath59 is the number of bunches . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     experimentally , total number of @xmath76-mesons per charm event is approximately equal to the sum of @xmath20- and @xmath77-meson production rates .",
    "produced @xmath76 may be detected via the simplest two - body decay @xmath78 with the branching ratio of @xmath79 .",
    "an estimate shows that @xmath76- meson reconstruction rate is more than corresponding quantity for @xmath20-meson by a factor of three due to a larger value of both the @xmath76-production cross section and decay branching ratio .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath20-tagging , a background to the @xmath76-production remains significant even after account of kinematic cuts , and it exceeds signal , for example at compass , by a factor of four @xcite .",
    "it means that correct evaluation of both the asymmetry and statistical precision of measurement requires a detailed analysis of the background , which is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "the most simple method to select charm production events consists in the detecting of muons from semileptonic @xmath80-meson decays .",
    "muons coming from light meson decays , as well as bethe - heitler pairs , contribute mainly to the low values of @xmath81 , so one may reduce these backgrounds by imposing cut on @xmath82-meson transverse momentum , say @xmath83 . assuming the branching ratio of the decay @xmath84 to be @xmath85 for @xmath76 and @xmath86 for @xmath87-meson , and ratio of the @xmath80-meson production rates per charm event to be @xmath88 one expect about @xmath89 prompt muons at tesla for @xmath90 correspondingly . in average",
    ", muon acquires a transverse momentum equal to about one half of the parent meson mass , that is @xmath91 in our case . to obtain a rough estimate ,",
    "suppose that only one half of muons coming from decays of @xmath80-mesons with @xmath92 will get a transverse momentum larger than @xmath93 .",
    "in this case a reconstruction rate is given by @xmath94 under assumption of @xmath95 muon detection efficiency .",
    "the precision of the asymmetry measurement with account of the target properties can be roughly estimated as @xmath96 the exact evaluation of the statistical error requires a close investigation of the background .",
    "nevertheless eq . ( [ mu_accuracy ] ) gives a good idea about an actual precision one may hope to reach at tesla experiment .",
    "we remind , for comparison , that slac collaboration expected to obtain statistical accuracy of asymmetry measurement about @xmath97 under severe conditions of large background coming from pile up of the events .",
    "in the present paper we have considered an opportunity to use polarized real photon beam for investigation of polarized gluon distributions .",
    "our estimate back up the possibility to achieve a higher accuracy in the measurement of charm photoproduction asymmetry compared with planned experiments at slac and cern .",
    "the proposed experiment may give unambiguous information about both the total value and the @xmath9- dependence of gluon polarization , which will permit to reduce significantly the number of acceptable models decsribing nucleon spin effects .",
