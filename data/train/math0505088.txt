    "in this paper , we consider in some detail the structure of pre - symmetry sets in 2d and 3d .",
    "recall that , given @xmath1 , a smooth closed curve in 2d or surface in 3d , the _ pre - symmetry set _ @xmath2 of @xmath1 is the closure of the set of pairs of distinct points @xmath3 for which there exists a circle or sphere tangent to @xmath1 at * p *  and at * q*. from the pre - symmetry set it is not difficult to pass to the _ symmetry set _ which is the locus of centres of these circles or spheres , together with the centres of the limiting circles .",
    "when @xmath1 is a plane curve , parametrized by the points of a circle @xmath4 , we can consider @xmath2 as a subset of the torus @xmath5 , represented in the plane by a square with opposite sides identified .",
    "note that in any dimension @xmath2 is symmetric : @xmath6 if and only if @xmath7 ; it follows that in 2d we can also regard @xmath2 as contained in @xmath5 with symmetric pairs identified .",
    "this is called the _ symmetric product _ of two circles and is a mbius band in which the boundary of the band represents the ` diagonal ' points @xmath8 . in the 3d case , with",
    "@xmath1 say topologically equivalent to a 2-sphere , we could consider @xmath2 as a subset of @xmath9 , which is topologically a complex quadric surface , or of the symmetric product which is topologically a complex projective plane as the riemann sphere , that is complex numbers together with @xmath10 , and then associating with an unordered pair @xmath11 of elements of @xmath12 the unique quadratic polynomial @xmath13 with roots @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding element of the complex projective plane is then @xmath16 and the diagonal corresponds to the conic @xmath17 .",
    "in fact the symmetric product of any closed 2-dimensional manifold with itself is known to be a 2-manifold , a surprising fact since one might imagine that the diagonal would cause singularities . ] .",
    "however we shall not be concerned here with global models of the pre - symmetry set , but rather with local or multi - local models .",
    "starting from a circle or sphere @xmath18 having @xmath19 contact points with our curve or surface @xmath1 , the pre - symmetry set can be partitioned into strata : + @xmath20  one stratum for each pair of distinct contact points , @xmath21 say , chosen from the @xmath22 points . here , we consider circles or spheres tangent to @xmath1 at points _ at or close to _ @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( if @xmath25 then these circles or spheres ` lose contact ' with @xmath1 close to the other @xmath26 contact points of @xmath18 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "+ @xmath20  one stratum for each contact point @xmath23 between @xmath18 and @xmath1 which is of type @xmath27 or higher  a vertex and its circle of curvature in 2d , or a ridge point and the corresponding sphere of curvature in 3d .",
    "this stratum of @xmath2 arises from circles or spheres which are tangent to @xmath1 at two points both of which are close to @xmath23 .",
    "note that we are concerned here with the symmetry set and not the medial axis : the circles or spheres do not have to remain inside @xmath1 ( or more generally be maximal with respect to @xmath1 ) .",
    "we can consider the above strata separately in our investigations .",
    "for example , starting with a sphere @xmath18 having contact @xmath28 at two points @xmath29 and @xmath27 at @xmath30 with a surface @xmath1 , we will have four strata which correspond to contacts close to @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in what follows",
    "we shall concentrate on the strata : + @xmath20 arising from _ two _ contact points : _ off - diagonal _ strata , or + @xmath20 arising from _ one _ contact point : _ on - diagonal _ strata + since the other cases can be reduced as above to these two .",
    "we shall argue that the ` correct ' way to think of these strata of the pre - symmetry set @xmath2 in 2d ( @xmath33 ) or 3d ( @xmath34 ) , when they are non - singular , is as _ the graph of a mapping from @xmath35 to @xmath35 . _ in this way we can capture the structure in a uniform way , both for a single curve or surface and for a 1-parameter family of such .",
    "the mapping in question will arise in a slightly different way for the on - diagonal and off - diagonal cases , but the principle is the same for both .",
    "several of the standard examples of mappings from the plane to the plane  @xcite  fold , cusp , lips , beaks , swallowtail  arise naturally in this context .",
    "see figure  [ fig : projs ] .",
    "the 2d case is relatively well - known  @xcite ; in  [ s:2d ] we summarize some results and interpret one of the cases as the graph of a mapping @xmath36 in order to set the scene for the 3d case .",
    "we also take the opportunity to prove a result which explains why only certain singularities of the pre - symmetry set can occur on the diagonal .    in ",
    "[ s:3d ] we turn to 3d .",
    "the underlying calculations here are rather complicated and we suppress them in favour of giving details of the results . this is part of a larger investigation of all the symmetry sets and pre - symmetry sets in 3d , for surfaces and generic 1-parameter families .",

    "the zero set of @xmath39 also contains diagonal pairs @xmath40 , and pairs where the tangents are parallel , and these need to be excluded when finding the true pre - symmetry set .",
    "let us examine the equation ( [ eq:2d - pre - ss ] ) close to a diagonal point , that is , when the curve @xmath1 has a vertex .",
    "we take @xmath1 in local form having a vertex at the origin : @xmath41 with no @xmath42 term . expanding ( [ eq:2d - pre - ss ] ) with the @xmath43 sign we find that there are no solutions close to the origin besides @xmath44 , and for the @xmath45 sign the leading terms ( of degree 5 ) factorise as @xmath46 for an _ ordinary vertex _ ( contact with the tangent circle of type @xmath27 exactly ) , @xmath47 and the local structure of the pre - symmetry set , apart from the diagonal , is a smooth transverse curve @xmath48 + h.o.t .",

    "note that there _ can not _ be a pair of real branches of the pre - symmetry set at such a diagonal point .",
    "we can also see this by noting that at an @xmath49 point the curvature @xmath53 does not have an extremum ( since @xmath54 ) and on an arc without an extremum of curvature there can be no bitangent circles  @xcite .",
    "the same analysis can be continued to @xmath55 , where the leading term is @xmath56 having a single transverse branch @xmath48 + h.o.t .",

    "in fact we shall suppress most of the underlying mathematical calculations , which are similar to those in  [ s:2d ] but more complicated since we are dealing here with surfaces instead of curves .",
    "there are a great many cases of transitions on the symmetry set in 3d .",
    "bogaevsky  @xcite has determined the transitions on the 3d medial axis ( see also @xcite ) and in unpublished work has given a list of all possible transitions on the 3d symmetry set , some of which have been investigated by pollitt  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall determine the pre - symmetry set for a small number of representative cases ; more mathematical detail and a larger number of cases will appear elsewhere .",
    "for the symmetry set of a generic surface @xmath1 in @xmath95 we consider here the following singularities : +    @xmath96 ,     + and for symmetry sets occurring in generic 1-parameter families of surfaces we consider +    @xmath61 transitions , @xmath97 .",
    "these results can also be used to determine other cases with three contact points , such as @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the cases @xmath100 can be treated similarly .",
    "the basic setup is two pieces of smooth surface and a given sphere tangent to both of them at known points .",
    "we then seek nearby points such that there is a sphere tangent at these nearby points . to put the matter more precisely , consider two pieces of surface @xmath1 and @xmath68 and chosen points @xmath101 such that there is a sphere @xmath18 tangent to @xmath1 at @xmath102 and to @xmath68 at @xmath103 .",
    "the order of tangency at either point might be @xmath59 for @xmath22 an integer such that the total tangency is consistent with either a single generic surface or a surface in a generic 1-parameter family of surfaces .",

    "further , let * m *  be the unit normal at * p * , oriented so that for @xmath102 the normal passes through the centre of the given sphere , and let * n *  be the unit normal at * q * , oriented similarly . then the condition for a pre - symmetry set point is @xmath112 in this equation , which is three scalar equations , there are five ` unknowns ' @xmath113 so we expect a two - dimensional solution .",
