    "an old , classical problem in complex geometry concerns the classification of the holomorphic structures on a fixed differentiable vector bundle on a complex manifold , up to isomorphism .",
    "the moduli problem for holomorphic vector bundles is devoted to studying the corresponding set of isomorphism classes and the geometric structures ( topologies , complex space structures , hermitian metrics , etc ) one can naturally put on this set .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath3 be a compact complex manifold of dimension @xmath10 and @xmath1 be a differentiable vector bundle of rank @xmath2 on @xmath3 .",
    "a semi - connection on @xmath1 is a first order operator @xmath11 satisfying the @xmath12-leibniz rule : @xmath13 for any @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the natural de rham - type extension @xmath16 will be denoted by the same symbol .",
    "a semi - connection @xmath17 is called integrable if @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the endomorphism - valued @xmath20-form defined by the composition @xmath21 .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the set of holomorphic structures on @xmath1 , and by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) the space of ( integrable ) semi - connections on @xmath1 .",
    "the newlander - nirenberg theorem gives a bijection @xmath25 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath26 the holomorphic structure on @xmath1 associated with an integrable semi - connection @xmath17 .",
    "for an open set @xmath27 the space @xmath28 of holomorphic sections of @xmath29 coincides with the kernel of the first order operator @xmath30 . using this bijection and the natural @xmath31-topology on @xmath32",
    "we obtain a natural topology on the space @xmath22 of holomorphic structures on @xmath1 .",
    "the moduli space of holomorphic structures on @xmath1 is the topological space obtained as the quotient @xmath33 of @xmath22 by the group @xmath34 of differentiable automorphisms of @xmath1 , which acts naturally on this space .",
    "since @xmath35 ( the structure group of a vector bundle ) is not a simple group , one considers a natural refinement of our moduli problem , which has a simple  symmetry group \" .",
    "let @xmath4 be a holomorphic structure on the determinant line bundle @xmath5 , and @xmath36 be the corresponding integrable semi - connection .",
    "a @xmath4-_oriented _ holomorphic structure on @xmath1 is a holomorphic structure @xmath37 on @xmath1 with @xmath38 .",
    "we recall that an @xmath39-vector bundle on @xmath3 is a rank @xmath2 vector bundle @xmath1 endowed with a trivialization of its determinant line bundle . therefore , in this case , @xmath40 comes with a tautological trivial holomorphic structure @xmath41 ; an @xmath39-_holomorphic structure _ on @xmath1 is just a @xmath41-oriented holomorphic structure in @xmath1 in our sense .",

    "the gauge group @xmath45 acts naturally on this subspace .",
    "we will focus on the moduli space of @xmath4-oriented holomorphic structures on @xmath1 , which , by definition , is the quotient space @xmath46 in general this quotient is highly non - hausdorff and can not be endowed with a natural complex space structure .",
    "it can be identified with the topological space associated with a holomorphic stack , but up till now it is not clear if , in our non - algebraic complex geometric framework , this approach leads to effective new results . on the other hand the classical point of view ( studying moduli spaces",
    "whose points correspond to equivalence classes of holomorphic structures ) has been used with effective results , for instance in making progress towards the classification of class vii surfaces @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we recall that a holomorphic structure @xmath37 on @xmath1 is called _ simple _ if @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast with @xmath48 , the moduli space @xmath49 of simple @xmath4-oriented holomorphic structures has a natural , in general non - hausdorff , complex space structure .",
    "this structure can be obtained in two different ways , which , a posteriori turn out to be equivalent .",
    "the first approach @xcite uses classical deformation theory .",
    "the second @xcite uses complex gauge theory .",
    "the equivalence of the two points of view has been established by miyajima @xcite .    as in algebraic geometry , in order to define hausdorff moduli spaces of holomorphic structures , one needs a stability condition , which depends on the choice of an additional structure on @xmath3 .",
    "whereas in algebraic geometry this additional structure is a polarisation on @xmath3 ( i.e. the choice of an ample line bundle on @xmath3 ) , in our general complex geometric framework we need a gauduchon metric on @xmath3 , i.e. a hermitian metric @xmath50 on @xmath3 whose associated @xmath51-form @xmath52 satisfies the gauduchon condition @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "such a metric defines a lie group morphism @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the chern form of the chern connection associated with a hermitian metric @xmath56 on @xmath57 . using this degree map",

    "stability is an open condition _ with respect to the classical topology _",
    "@xcite , hence @xmath67 is open in both @xmath49 , and @xmath71 .",
    "in particular @xmath67 comes with a natural complex space space structure induced from @xmath49 .",
    "note that in general , in the non - khlerian framework , semi - stability is not an open condition ( even with respect to the classical topology ) .",
    "+ by choosing a hermitian metric @xmath56 on @xmath1 , @xmath71 can be identified with the moduli space of projectively hermitian - einstein connections on @xmath1 , defined as follows .",

    "the kobayashi - hitchin correspondence has important consequences : using standard gauge - theoretical techniques one can prove that the quotient topology of @xmath96 is hausdorff .",
    "the point is that , for this moduli space , the gauge group @xmath101 is the group of sections of a locally trivial bundle with compact standard fibre .",
    "therefore @xmath71 , @xmath67 are hausdorff spaces , and in particular @xmath67 is a hausdorff complex subspace of the ( possibly non - hausdorff ) moduli space @xmath49 .",
    "the first natural question related to the kobayashi - hitchin correspondence is : _ does @xmath71 have a natural complex space structure extending the canonical complex space structure of @xmath67 ? _",
    "the explicit examples described in @xcite , @xcite and the general results proved in @xcite show that in general the answer is negative .",
    "for instance , for a class vii surface @xmath3 with @xmath102 , a bundle @xmath1 with @xmath103 , @xmath104 and a suitable gauduchon metric @xmath50 on @xmath3 , the moduli space @xmath71 can be identified with a compact disk , whose interior corresponds to @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , on a class vii surface @xmath3 with @xmath105 one obtains in a similar way a moduli space @xmath71 which can be identified with @xmath106 , and in this case @xmath67 corresponds to the complement of the union of two circles in @xmath106 .",
    "these examples show that , in the general ( possibly non - khlerian ) framework the complex space structure on @xmath67 does not extend to a complex space structure on @xmath71 . on the other hand , in general @xmath71",
    "is not compact , and when this is the case , even if the complex structure of @xmath67 does extend to @xmath71 , the result is not satisfactory .",
    "this motivates the following :    [ qq1 ] let @xmath0 be a compact gauduchon manifold , @xmath1 be a differentiable rank @xmath2 vector bundle on @xmath3 and @xmath4 be a fixed holomorphic structure on @xmath5 .",
    "does the complex space structure of @xmath67 extend to a complex space structure on a natural compactification of it , which contains the space @xmath71 ?",
    "note that , in the case @xmath84 , one has a good candidate for  a natural compactification of @xmath67 which contains @xmath71 \" : we identify @xmath67 with @xmath6 via the kobayashi - hitchin isomorphism , and we embed the latter space in the donaldson compactification of @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , in the case @xmath84 , one can ask a more precise version of question 1 :    [ qq2 ] let @xmath0 be a compact gauduchon surface , @xmath1 be a differentiable rank @xmath2 vector bundle on @xmath3 and @xmath4 be a fixed holomorphic structure on @xmath5 . does the complex space structure on @xmath6 induced by the kobayashi - hitchin correspondence extend to a complex space structure on the donaldson compactification @xmath7 ?",
    "as the examples above show , in our general ( possibly non - khlerian ) framework both questions have negative answer . indeed , in our examples the space @xmath107 is already compact , and admits no complex space structure at all .",
    "on the other hand we believe that both questions have positive answer when @xmath0 is khler . in other words    [ conj1 ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact khler manifold , @xmath1 be a differentiable rank @xmath2 vector bundle on @xmath3 and @xmath4 be a fixed holomorphic structure on @xmath5 .",
    "then the natural complex space structure of @xmath67 ( induced from @xmath49 ) extends to a natural compactification of it which contains @xmath71 . for @xmath84 the natural complex space structure of @xmath67",
    "extends to the donaldson compactification @xmath7 of @xmath107 .",
    "this conjecture is known to hold in the projective algebraic framework ( when @xmath52 is the chern form of an ample line bundle @xmath108 on @xmath3 ) for @xmath109-bundles . in this case , for @xmath84 one proves @xcite that @xmath7 can be identified with the image in a projective space of a regular map defined on a zariski closed subset of the gieseker moduli space associated with the data @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "this gieseker moduli space is a projective variety .",
    "taking into account li s result , and the fact that any compact khler surface admits arbitrary small deformations which are projective ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , conjecture [ conj1 ] becomes very natural .",
    "the recent results of @xcite concern the higher dimensional projective case , and give further evidence for this conjecture .",
    "+ in this article we will study in detail question 2 in an interesting special case : the moduli space of @xmath109-structures on an @xmath109-bundle @xmath1 with @xmath113 on a class vii surface @xmath3 .",

    "note that for @xmath160 one has @xmath161 whereas , for @xmath162 , the choice of a representative @xmath163 gives an identification @xmath164 .",
    "therefore the space @xmath118 of reducible flat instantons on @xmath3 decomposes as a finite disjoint union of segments and circles : @xmath165 the set of all vertices appearing in the first term of ( [ segmcirc ] ) can be identified with the set of fixed points of @xmath126 , which coincides with @xmath166 and has an important gauge theoretical interpretation : it corresponds to the moduli space of reducible flat @xmath8-instantons with _ non - abelian stabiliser _ @xmath8 .",
    "all other points of @xmath118 correspond to reducible flat @xmath8-instantons with abelian stabiliser @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , from a gauge theoretical point of view , the first term in the decomposition ( [ segmcirc ] ) ( which is always non - empty ) is substantially more complex than the second , because a segment @xmath168 contains both abelian and non - abelian reductions .",

    "this result is surprising for two reasons : first , @xmath118 is a union of segments and circles , which are not complex geometric objects ; second , since the vertices of the segments @xmath158 ( @xmath171 ) are isolated non - abelian reductions , one expects essential singularities at these points .    our second result concerns the extensibility of the complex space structure across @xmath121 :    [ th2 ] let @xmath3 be a class vii surface , and let @xmath1 be be an @xmath109-bundle on @xmath3 with @xmath113",

    "here we denoted by @xmath176 the second symmetric power of @xmath37 ; an element @xmath177 is degenerate if the associated linear map @xmath178 has non - trivial kernel .",
    "since @xmath179 , this is equivalent to the condition that @xmath180 belongs to the image of the squaring map @xmath181 .    finally , the extensibility of the complex space structure across the subspace @xmath115 has been studied in detail in a more general framework in @xcite . in our special case",
    "the result is the following    [ th3 ] @xcite let @xmath3 be a class vii surface endowed with a gauduchon metric @xmath50 with @xmath182 , and let @xmath1 be an @xmath109-bundle on @xmath3 with @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath119 is a smooth 4-fold , and the reduction locus @xmath115 is a union of @xmath183 circles .",
    "any such circle has a neighbourhood which can be identified with a neighbourhood of the singular circle in a flip passage ; in particular the holomorphic structure of @xmath184 does not extend across any of these circles .    in other words , for class vii surfaces with @xmath185 ,",
    "the holomorphic structure does _ not _ extend across the circles of reductions in the moduli space , but ( supposing @xmath182 ) the structure of the moduli space around such a circle is perfectly understood .",
    "note that the condition @xmath182 is not restrictive .",
    "indeed , using the classification of class vii surfaces with @xmath186 @xcite and the results of @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 ) ) , it follows that :    any class vii surface whose minimal model is not an inoue surface admits gauduchon metrics @xmath50 such that @xmath182 .",
    "a surprising corollary of our results is :    [ primhopf ] let @xmath0 be a primary hopf surface endowed with a gauduchon metric , and @xmath1 be an @xmath109-bundle on @xmath3 with @xmath113 .",
    "then the natural complex structure on @xmath98 is smooth and extends to a complex structure on @xmath169 , which becomes a 4-dimensional compact complex manifold .",
    "this study of moduli spaces of @xmath8-instantons on class vii surfaces has several motivations .",
    "first , in recent articles the second author showed that @xmath187-instanton moduli spaces can be used to make progress on the classification of class vii surfaces , more precisely to prove the existence of curves on such surfaces @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a natural question is : can one obtain similar ( or even stronger ) results using moduli spaces of @xmath8-instantons ? in order to follow this strategy one needs a thorough understanding of _ compactified _ such moduli spaces .",
    "a second motivation is related to corollary [ primhopf ] : according to this result , the assignment @xmath188 defines a functor from the category of gauduchon primary hopf surfaces to the class of 4-dimensional smooth compact complex manifolds .",
    "moreover , it is known that @xmath119 is endowed with a canonical hermitian metric @xmath189 which is strongly kt , i.e. , satisfies @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "the class of compact strongly kt hermitian manifolds has been intensively studied in recent years .",
    "this class of manifolds intervenes in modern physical theories ( ii string theory , 2-dimensional supersymmetric @xmath180-models ) and also in hitchin s theory of generalised khler geometry .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask    [ kt ] in the conditions of corollary [ primhopf ] does the canonical strongly kt metric on @xmath191 extend to a smooth hermitian metric on the complex 4-fold @xmath169 ?",
    "if this question has a positive answer , the resulting metric on @xmath169 will be strongly kt , giving an interesting functor from the category of gauduchon primary hopf surfaces to the category of compact strongly kt 4-dimensional manifolds .",
    "this functor would yield a large class of examples of 4-dimensional strongly kt compact manifolds .",
    "we will come back to question [ kt ] in a future article . a third motivation : the novelty of the methods used in the proofs , which emphasise surprising difficulties which occur in the non - khlerian framework .",
    "we shall explain the ideas of proofs and these difficulties in the next subsections , and in the course of the subsequent proofs themselves , it will be apparent that our methods will be applicable in many other situations .",
    "in the first part of the proof we study @xmath169 from the topological point of view . we show that any reducible flat @xmath8-instanton @xmath81 on a class vii surface is regular , i.e. one has @xmath192 . using the local model theorem for virtual instantons ( * ? ? ?",
