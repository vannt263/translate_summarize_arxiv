    "over the last few decades technological advancements in trapping have allowed for the creation of a range of ultracold dilute gases in the quantum degenerate regime . in bosonic systems ,",
    "quantum statistics lead to a global phase coherence and macroscopic occupation of the ground state of the system . in spinor condensates",
    "the atomic spin degrees - of - freedom are energetically accessible leading to a unique scenario in which _ both _ superfluity and magnetism can exist @xcite .",
    "the first spinor condensates were made with @xmath0rb in a double magnetic trap @xcite and with @xmath1na in an optical trap @xcite .",
    "there has been a subsequent explosion of experimental @xcite , and theoretical @xcite studies in the area .",
    "studying the interplay between superfluidity and magnetism has proven to be a rich area for probing the many - body dynamics of the static and nonequilibrium behavior of these systems leading to novel phenomena such as spin textures , spin domains , and complex spin mixing dynamics @xcite .",
    "many of the interesting phenomena in spinor condensates hinge on extreme sensitivity to the relative strengths of two - body interactions between the internal states ; those interactions are typically weak for alkali atoms ( with the exception of @xmath2rb @xcite , and possibly also @xmath3cs and @xmath4li ) and as a consequence the spinor physics with strong interactions has largely remained unexplored . although the usual feshbach resonance technique for tuning the interactions @xcite can not immediately be applied to spinor condensates , several proposals for achieving such control exist @xcite , which enable possible ways to study strongly correlated spinor condensates . evidently , as the interactions become resonant , three - body contributions need to be considered . in the strongly correlated regime ,",
    "i.e. , when the @xmath5-wave two - body scattering lengths associated with the hyperfine spin states exceed the typical range of interatomic interactions ( the van der waals length , @xmath6 ) , efimov physics becomes important @xcite , and several new aspects have to be considered .",
    "for instance , the existence of an infinity of weakly bound efimov trimers strongly affects the scattering observables at ultracold energies and can potentially impact the spin dynamics in spinor condensates .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical work on the three - body parameter @xcite has extended the universal properties of efimov states allowing for further quantitative predictions of few - body phenomena relevant for spinor condensates .",
    "one of the major differences between the usual ",
    "spinless \" efimov physics and the effect for spinor systems is the presence of multiple length scales in the problem . in spinor condensates",
    "the atomic energy levels are @xmath7-fold degenerate ( @xmath8 is the atomic hyperfine angular momentum and @xmath9 its azimuthal component ) , and there exist @xmath10 rotationally - invariant @xmath5-wave scattering lengths @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we explored in depth the efimov physics for @xmath11 spinor condensates and showed how the presence of the additional internal degrees of freedom can lead to multiple families of efimov states that strongly affect the condensate spin dynamics .",
    "in the context of nuclear physics , where isospin symmetry plays an important role , the work of bulgac and efimov @xcite has also demonstrated a much richer structure for efimov physics when the spin degree of freedom was considered . as we will see later in this manuscript",
    ", a fundamental difference of the spin physics in nuclear systems and spinor condensates is that in a gas phase the atoms can be prepared in a single spin substate , which is not an eigenstate of well - defined total angular momentum .",
    "our treatment begins with a summary of the multichannel generalization of the adiabatic hyperspherical representation using contact two - body interactions .",
    "we then characterize the efimov physics for spin-1 , -2 and -3 by determining the topology of the three - body hyperspherical potentials and analysing the possible families of efimov states present in each case .",
    "special attention is given to the spin-2 @xmath2rb condensate due to the naturally large values for the atomic scattering lengths found in ref .",
    "finally , we determine the important three - body mean - field parameters , thus building the fundamental blocks for future studies of three - body effects in spinor condensates .",
    "our study of few - body physics in spinor condensates begins from the multichannel generalization of the zero - range fermi pseudopotential for s - wave interactions . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a suitable generalization was proposed to be ( in a.u . )",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the three - dimensional dirac delta - function , @xmath14 is the atomic mass , and @xmath15 is a scattering length _ operator _ which incorporates all the important multichannel structure of the two - body interactions @xcite . for spinor condensates",
    "we assume the scattering length operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pseudo ] ) can be defined for each pair of atoms as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the two - body spin functions of total angular momentum @xmath18 and projection @xmath19 , expressed in terms of the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "therefore , the two - body interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pseudo ] ) is diagonal in the spin basis @xmath20 .",
    "we note that , due to bosonic symmetry only the symmetric spin states ( @xmath21 even ) are allowed to interact with rotationally - invariant scattering lengths @xmath22 .",
    "these scattering lengths set important length scales in the system .",
    "many - body properties of the system such as the miscibility of spin components are sensitive to the relative strength and sign of the scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "their strength also signifies the appearance of universal three - body physics in the scattering observables .",
    "the three - body problem is solved using a multichannel generalization of the adiabatic hyperspherical method via a green s function approach developed in ref .  @xcite . as usual , the three - body system is characterized by a single length scale , the hyperradius @xmath23 . the mass - scaled jacobi vectors ( written in the `` odd - man - out '' notation )",
    "are given in terms of the atomic distances by @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "a set @xmath26 of six hyperrangles describe all other internal degrees of freedom associated to the system s internal motion . treating the hyperradius as an adiabatic parameter",
    ", the three - body wave - function can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the hyperradial wave functions , @xmath29 the channel functions and @xmath30 the three - body spin functions , formed by the combination of all possible product states , chosen to simplify the formulation .",
    "the adiabatic channel functions are eigenstates of the fixed-@xmath31 hyperangular schrdinger equation @xmath32\\phi_{\\nu}^{\\sigma}(r;\\omega)=u_{\\nu}(r)\\phi_{\\nu}^{\\sigma}(r;\\omega),\\label{eq : schrodinger}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with corresponding eigenvalues given by the adiabatic potentials @xmath33 which determine the hyperradial motion and describe ( in conjunction with the nonadiabatic couplings ) the possible bound states and scattering properties of the system . in the above equation , @xmath34 is the the three - body reduced mass , @xmath35 is the grand angular momentum @xcite , @xmath36 is the sum of all possible pairwise interactions [ eq .

    "equation  ( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) is solved using a hyperangular green s function and the corresponding lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite for each component of the channel function , @xmath43 where @xmath44 the components of the hyperangular green s function satisfy @xmath45g_{\\sigma\\sigma}(\\omega,\\omega')=\\delta(\\omega,\\omega')$ ] , where @xmath5 is related to the hyperangular eigenvalue @xmath33 through @xmath46 evaluating the integral over @xmath47 , considering only states of total orbital angular momentum @xmath48 , and solving the lippmann - schwinger equation reduces to determining values of @xmath5 for which the determinant of the matrix @xmath49\\label{eq : q}\\ ] ] vanishes @xcite . in the equation above the matrix element for the @xmath50 matrices are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the matrix element for the two - body scattering matrix written in the three - body spin basis , @xmath53 with the @xmath39th particle as spectator to the interaction .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath55 matrices represent cyclic and anti - cyclic permutations of the the three - body spin basis @xmath56    the spin basis @xmath57 was chosen to to give simple expressions for the components of @xmath58 which were written in the odd - man - out notation . in this form , however , @xmath58 does not account for any symmetry property in the system .",
    "this is fixed by the unitary transformation @xmath59 with @xmath60 where the three - body spin functions of total angular momentum @xmath61 and projection @xmath62 are given by latexmath:[\\ ] ]    where @xmath171 , @xmath183 , and @xmath176 are the values of the two - body scattering lengths where a @xmath65 efimov resonance occur .",
    "note that now two distinct families of efimov states ( associated to @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) can affect the spin dynamics .",
    "although we expect the values for @xmath178 to be close to -10@xmath6 an analysis similar to the one for identical bosons @xcite is necessary to precisely determine such values .    for higher spin",
    "the three - body contribution introduces additional complexity on the manifold of possible ground state phases of the spinor condensate .",
    "the full study of the impact of three - body contributions on the many - body phases of spinor condensates remains however the subject of future investigation .",
    "in summary , we have solved the three - body problem for strongly - correlated spinor condensates . in this regime",
    ", the efimov effect can play an important role for the spin dynamics of the condensate . for",
    "spinor systems multiple families of efimov states can exist , leading to novel scaling laws and interesting spin dynamics . for small applied field ,",
    "the families of efimov states of different spin states can couple and may produce ultra long - lived states . curiously , in the case of spin-3 atoms there exist overlapping efimov series even at zero applied field .",
    "the three - body hyperspherical adiabatic potentials for @xmath2rb are analyzed to illustrate possible strong effects due to efimov states .",
    "finally , the existence of efimov states can impact the three - body scattering observables and many - body phases of the system , and offer novel regimes for the spinor system .",
