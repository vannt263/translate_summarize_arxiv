    "within recent years , quantum computation has become a well established field of research in both experimental and theoretical physics . at the heart of this field",
    "is the notion that the highly entangled correlations of many - particle quantum systems could be used as a tool to efficiently solve problems of equally challenging complexity . in order to convert a quantum system from a mere object of observation into a problem solving tool ,",
    "it is necessary to establish a nearly complete control over quantum processes at the microscopic level .    in close analogy to conventional computation , the method of establishing this high level of control over large quantum systems is to assemble the quantum systems from the smallest possible element offered by quantum theory , the two level system . for obvious reasons ,",
    "this two level system is then referred to as a quantum bit or qubit .",
    "however , its physical properties are better visualized by the analogy with the three dimensional spin of a spin-1/2 system .",
    "in fact , one possible explanation for the efficiency of quantum computation is the fact that the possibilities of rotating a spin are infinite , while a classical bit can only be flipped .",
    "intriguingly , quantum mechanics smoothly connects these seemingly contradictory aspects of reality in a single consistent theory .    in principle , it is possible to construct a universal quantum computer using only local spin rotations and a single well - defined interaction @xcite .",
    "one such well - defined interaction between two qubits is the quantum controlled - not gate . when observed in the computational basis ( usually associated with the @xmath0-component in the spin analogy ) , this gate performs a classical controlled - not logic operation .",
    "however , it is completely quantum coherent , so its actual performance is far more complex than that of its classical namesake .    since the successful realization of a quantum controlled -",
    "not would enable universal quantum computation , a significant amount of experimental effort has been devoted to this goal .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite to @xcite for examples . )",
    "however , experimental realizations are never identical to the ideal device described by theory . in order to demonstrate that an experimental device really performs the intended function , it needs to be tested . for classical logic gates , such a test is straightforward , since the number of possible operations is finite .",
    "but for operations on qubits , the possibility of arbitrarily small phase shifts implies that the number of possible quantum coherent operations is in principle infinite .",
    "therefore , the experimental test of a quantum gate requires a somewhat deeper understanding of the essential features of general quantum operations .",
    "in particular , we need to go beyond the rather fuzzy image of quantum coherence and the associated `` parallelism '' of quantum superpositions , towards a more specific approach based on the observable features of quantum devices .    in this review",
    ", we briefly introduce the proper theoretical description of experimental quantum processes .",
    "we then show that the essential features of a quantum process can be defined in terms of only two complementary operations @xcite and derive estimates for the quantum process fidelity and the entanglement capabilities based on the corresponding complementary classical fidelities .",
    "finally , we present a recently realized optical controlled - not gate @xcite and show how information about the actual device performance can be obtained from the experimental data .",
    "ideally , a quantum operation can be represented by a unitary operator @xmath1 acting on the input state @xmath2 in the @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space of the quantum system . since all quantum states can be expanded in terms of a complete orthogonal basis set @xmath4 , the effect of the unitary operation on an arbitrary input state is completely defined by its effects on such a set of @xmath3 basis states , @xmath5 because the operation is unitary , the output states @xmath6 also form an orthogonal basis set .",
    "the quantum operation is thus completely deterministic and leaves no room for unpredictable errors . in particular",
    ", it should be noted that the phases of the states @xmath7 are also defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) , so that the unitary transformation actually defines much more than the transformation of an eigenvalue @xmath8 to a corresponding eigenvalue @xmath9 .",
    "obviously , it is very difficult to realize a nearly deterministic error free quantum operation experimentally .",
    "the idealized description given by a single unitary operation @xmath1 is therefore not normally sufficient to describe noisy experimental processes .",
    "instead , we have to assume that the actual process @xmath10 acting on the input state @xmath2 may fluctuate randomly and is not necessarily unitary .",
    "if the probability distribution over possible processes @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 , the output state is described by a mixed state density matrix @xcite , @xmath12 in general , any reproducible quantum process can be represented in such a form . however , if the precise source of errors is unknown , it is not possible to identify a unique set of operations @xmath10 . for the experimental evaluation of quantum processes ,",
    "it is therefore more useful to find a representation that does not depend on the specific error syndromes @xmath10 .",
    "it is in fact possible to express any noisy process in a @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space in terms of an orthogonal set of @xmath13 operators @xmath14 by considering the @xmath15 matrices representing the operators as vectors in a @xmath13-dimensional vector space @xcite .",
    "an ideal process can then be expressed as @xmath16 and any noisy process @xmath17 can be described by a process matrix with elements @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 each process can thus be decomposed into a finite set of orthogonal processes @xmath20 , and the complete process is then defined by its process matrix elements @xmath18 .    in principle , the complete @xmath21 process matrix elements can always be evaluated by measuring the output statistics of a sufficient number of non - orthogonal input states @xcite .",
    "this approach , called quantum process tomography , treats the quantum process as a black box , requiring no further assumptions about the intended process itself . in order to test a specific quantum operation however , it may be more useful to formulate the process matrix in terms of basis processes @xmath20 that are close to experimentally observable error syndromes of the device . as we show in the following ,",
    "it is then possible to obtain useful information about the device performance without an abstract analysis of the huge amount of data required for complete quantum process tomography .",
    "for qubits , each error can be expanded in terms of products of errors acting on a single qubit , and the single qubit errors can be expressed in terms of the identity @xmath22 and the three pauli matrices , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite . using the spin analogy , these errors correspond to spin flips ( rotations of 180 degrees ) around the @xmath26- , @xmath27- and @xmath0-axis , respectively .",
    "an @xmath28-qubit system is thus characterized by the @xmath28-qubit identity @xmath29 and @xmath30 spin flip errors , @xmath31 .",
    "if the intended operation is @xmath1 , errors will be detected by comparing the output qubit statistics with the ideal operation .",
    "it is therefore useful to characterize the errors with reference to @xmath1 as output errors @xmath32 .",
    "the noisy process is then described by @xmath33 where the diagonal elements @xmath34 of the process matrix now correspond to the distribution of spin - flip errors in the output .",
    "it is thus possible to identify experimentally observed output errors directly with a group of theoretical error syndromes and their corresponding process matrix elements .",
    "we now have a convenient mathematical form for the representation of errors in a quantum operation . however , we still need to determine the errors experimentally , so it is necessary to consider the observable effects of the errors for a given set of output states . since most quantum information processes are formulated in the computational basis defined by the eigenvalues of @xmath25 , it is useful to start by considering an operation which produces the @xmath25 basis states in the output , @xmath35 . in the @xmath25 basis , the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 represents bit flips , and the operators @xmath22 and @xmath25 preserve the qubit value .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 also change the phase relation between the qubit states , but this phase change can not be observed in the @xmath25 basis .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to distinguish @xmath22 from @xmath25 or @xmath24 from @xmath23 when the output is measured in the @xmath25 basis .",
    "most importantly , a quantum device that always produces the correct @xmath25 output may still have phase errors that destroy the quantum coherence between the outcomes .",
    "in fact , there are a total of @xmath36 mutually orthogonal operations consistent with the correct @xmath25 basis output of an @xmath28 qubit operation , defined by assigning either the identity @xmath22 or the phase flip @xmath25 to each qubit . in order to detect these errors ,",
    "it is necessary to perform an operation that is sensitive to @xmath25-errors in the output .",
    "since the @xmath25-errors represent spin rotations around the @xmath25-axis , this is most naturally achieved by using a complementary set of inputs @xmath37 that result in @xmath23 basis outputs , @xmath38 .",
    "in this basis , the @xmath25-errors show up as bit flips , so that all error syndromes will show up either in the @xmath25-operation or in the @xmath23-operation .",
    "whether an experimental quantum process really performs the intended quantum coherent operation @xmath1 can therefore be tested efficiently by observing the classical logic operations in the computational @xmath25 basis and the complementary classical logic operation in the @xmath23 basis . if both operations are performed with high fidelity , the device will also perform any other quantum coherent operation reliably well .",
    "we have now seen that only an ideal error free quantum process can produce correct outputs in both the @xmath25- and the @xmath23 basis .",
    "however , experimental processes will usually show errors in both operations . to evaluate these errors ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce measures that do not depend on the choice of @xmath25 and @xmath23 outputs , but are equally valid for any kind of quantum coherent operation .",
    "one such measure immediately suggests itself from the formulation of the process matrix in eq.([eq : pm ] ) .",
    "since the matrix element @xmath39 represents the probability of the correct quantum operation @xmath1 ( as opposed to the probabilities of the errors @xmath40 given by @xmath34 ) , it seems natural to identify @xmath39 with the quantum process fidelity @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , this definition is now widely used to evaluate quantum processes based on the full process matrix obtained by quantum tomography @xcite .",
    "however , it is not immediately clear from eq.([eq : pm ] ) how the matrix element @xmath42 relates to the individual fidelities observed for specific input states @xmath2 . to get a more intuitive understanding of quantum process fidelity , it is therefore useful to know that @xmath41 can also be defined operationally , as the fidelity that would be obtained by applying the process to one part of a maximally entangled pair of @xmath28-level systems .",
    "if the maximally entangled state is given by @xmath43 and the processes @xmath44 and acts only on system @xmath45 , @xmath41 can then be defined as @xmath46 the application of a quantum process to one part of an entangled pair is thus sensitive to all possible errors @xmath40 .    an even better intuitive understanding of the process fidelity can be obtained by considering the relation between eq.([eq : fqp ] ) and the fidelity expected for a randomly selected local input state @xmath47 in system @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , any such state can be prepared from@xmath48 by simply performing a local measurement on system @xmath49 .",
    "it is then possible to derive a relation between the process fidelity @xmath41 , and the average fidelity @xmath50 , defined as the probability of obtaining the correct output averaged over all possible input states @xcite , @xmath51 in the light of the present error analysis , this relation can now be understood in terms of the sensitivity of the ( local ) input states @xmath47 to the different errors @xmath40 .",
    "specifically , the discussion of @xmath23 and @xmath25 output errors above has shown that these operations are insensitive to exactly @xmath52 out of the @xmath53 possible errors @xmath40 .",
    "we can conjecture that any input state @xmath47 is insensitive to a fraction of @xmath54 of all possible errors .",
    "therefore , a process fidelity of @xmath55 results in an average fidelity @xmath50 of exactly @xmath54 , representing the probability of finding input states that are insensitive to the errors of the operation .    after having convinced ourselves of the usefulness of the quantum process fidelity @xmath41 as a measure of the general device performance",
    ", we can now return to the task of determining this measure from a limited number of test measurements .",
    "for this purpose , we need to define the classical fidelities of the two complementary operations resulting in @xmath25 or in @xmath23 output states .",
    "these fidelities are directly obtained by averaging over the @xmath3 probabilities of measuring the correct output state @xmath56 or @xmath57 after applying the quantum process @xmath17 to an input of @xmath58 or @xmath59 , @xmath60 by applying the definition of these classical fidelities to the process matrix representation in eq.([eq : pm ] ) , we find that the classical fidelities @xmath61 and @xmath62 are given by sums of diagonal elements @xmath34 . for simplicity , we will now label the errors @xmath63 according to their effects on @xmath25 and @xmath23 outputs .",
    "each error is then identified by a pair of bit flip patterns , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) indicates no error in the @xmath25 ( @xmath23 ) basis outputs .",
    "the diagonal elements contributing to @xmath61 and @xmath62 are then given by @xmath67 each classical fidelity thus includes the process fidelity @xmath68 and a different set of error probabilities , @xmath69 for @xmath61 and @xmath70 for @xmath62 .    since the diagonal elements of the process matrix must add up to one , it is possible to define an additional relation between the total number of errors and the process fidelity , @xmath71 with this relation ,",
    "it is possible to express the process fidelity @xmath68 in terms of a sum of the classical complementary fidelities and the probabilities @xmath72 for errors observed in both operations ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 this is a significant result , since it provides a quantitative lower limit of the process fidelity @xmath41 using only the classical fidelities obtained from two times @xmath3 orthogonal input states .",
    "in addition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fchi ] ) provides an upper limit by showing that the process fidelity is always lower than the classical fidelities .",
    "the process fidelity @xmath41 is therefore limited to an interval of @xcite @xmath76 defined by the experimental results for the fidelities @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the two complementary classical operations observed in the @xmath23 and the @xmath25 basis .",
    "up to now , we did not discuss any specific properties of the operation @xmath1 , and all of the arguments above also apply to the problem of transmitting a string of qubits unchanged ( intended operation @xmath77 ) .",
    "in fact , the original definitions of fidelities , used e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , actually derive from this problem of characterizing quantum channels . however , the purpose of quantum computation is the manipulation of entanglement .",
    "it is therefore essential that the operations are capable of generating and discriminating various kinds of entangled states .    in particular ,",
    "the generation of entanglement is commonly recognized as a key feature of genuine quantum operations , and has therefore been used extensively as an experimental criterion for the successful implementation of quantum gates .",
    "the most widely used figure of merit is the entanglement capability @xmath78 , defined as the maximal amount of entanglement that the gate can generate from local inputs @xcite .",
    "however , it is usually not easy to determine the amount of entanglement of an experimentally generated state . instead , the most simple experimental approach is to estimate the minimal entanglement necessary to obtain an experimentally observed correlation average expressed by so - called entanglement witnesses @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "the most useful entanglement witnesses are the ones constructed from the projection on the intended entangled state @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the maximal fidelity of @xmath79 for non - entangled states ( @xmath82 for @xmath83 entanglement ) .",
    "it is then possible to derive a measure of the entanglement capability directly from the fidelities of entanglement generation .",
    "specifically , if the ideal quantum process @xmath1 is capable of generating a maximally entangled state from local inputs , the minimal entanglement capability of an experimental realization with process fidelity @xmath41 is simply given by @xmath84 since @xmath41 is the minimal probability of obtaining the correct output state .",
    "in addition to the generation of entanglement , quantum gates can also perform the reverse operation of converting entangled inputs into local outputs . at first sight , it may not be clear why this is useful , since decoherence and local measurements appear to have the same effect .",
    "however , only non - local quantum operations can decode the quantum information encoded in a entangled states by transforming orthogonal entangled inputs into orthogonal local states .",
    "the measure of non - locality for the `` disentanglement '' of entangled states is therefore the capability of distinguishing orthogonal entangled states . since orthogonal entangled states are often referred to as bell states , a device with this capability is also known as a bell analyzer",
    ". it may therefore be useful to define another measure of non - locality to characterize the operation of such bell analyzers .    in the following ,",
    "we define the entanglement discrimination @xmath85 using the fidelities @xmath86 of the operations @xmath87 where @xmath88 are two orthogonal entangled inputs and @xmath89 are the corresponding orthogonal local outputs .",
    "an operation that can not distinguish the two input states generates the same random output for both inputs , so the maximal average fidelity @xmath90 is @xmath91 .",
    "we therefore define the entanglement discrimination as @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath93 must be greater than or equal to @xmath41 , we obtain an estimate of the entanglement discrimination of @xmath94 from the process fidelity @xmath41 .    it may be worth noting that this estimate corresponds to the entanglement capability estimate for @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) . in the following analysis of a quantum controlled - not operation",
    ", it can be seen that this similarity arises from the time - reversal symmetry of entanglement generation and entanglement discrimination .",
    "it is therefore possible to generalize the definition of entanglement discrimination to the case of distinguishing @xmath97 orthogonal @xmath83 entangled states , so that the two estimates become equal . in the present context",
    ", however , the simple definition of pair discrimination will be sufficient .",
    "we have now analyzed the theoretical possibilities of errors in quantum devices and their general effects on entanglement generation and discrimination . based on this foundation",
    ", we can now proceed to evaluate experimental data from an actual quantum process realized in the laboratory .",
    "the device we will consider is a quantum controlled - not based on linear optics and post - selection @xcite . in this device , a non - linear interaction between two photonic qubits is achieved by interference between the two photon reflection and the two photon transmission components at a central beam splitter of reflectivity @xmath98 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] ( a ) .",
    "recently , several groups succeeded in developing a very compact version of this device , where each photonic qubit follows only a single optical path and the interaction is realized at a partially polarizing beam splitter ( ppbs ) of reflectivity 1/3 for horizontally ( @xmath99 ) polarized light and reflectivity 1 for vertically ( @xmath100 ) polarized light @xcite . the schematic setup of this device is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] ( b ) .",
    "details of the specific experimental setup developed by us can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as in most experiments using photons as qubits ,",
    "the input photon pairs were generated by spontaneous type ii parametric downconversion using a beta barium borate ( bbo ) crystal .",
    "the crystal was pumped by an argon ion laser at a wavelength of 351.1 nm , generating photon pairs in orthogonal polarization at a wavelength of 702.2 nm . the photon polarization",
    "( that is , the local states of the qubits ) of these photon pairs was then controlled by half wave plates to achieve the desired input states .",
    "after the controlled - not operation at the ppbs , the output polarizations of the photons was detected by a standard setup using another set of half wave plates , polarization beam splitters , and single photon counters ( spcm - aq - fc , perkin elmer ) .",

    "the most simple example is the operation on @xmath133 eigenstates where the control qubit input is in a @xmath25 state and the target qubit input is in an @xmath23 state . since these states are eigenstates of the ideal quantum controlled - not operator @xmath136 , the ideal gate performs the identity operation on these @xmath133 inputs .",

    "as the analysis of the errors in our experimental quantum controlled - not gate has shown , the classical logic operations observed in a pair of complementary basis sets can provide surprisingly detailed information about the performance of a quantum device .",
    "in particular , it is possible to obtain good estimates of the process fidelity @xmath41 , the entanglement capability @xmath78 , and the entanglement discrimination @xmath85 from only a small fraction of the data needed for a complete reconstruction of the process matrix by quantum process tomography .",
    "interestingly , the complementary processes of the quantum controlled - not are completely local .",
    "it is therefore possible to estimate the non - local properties of the gate described by the entanglement capability @xmath78 and the entanglement discrimination @xmath85 without ever generating entangled states .",
    "besides the obvious advantages of gaining quick and efficient access to the most important measures characterizing a quantum process , the analysis of the process matrix in terms of its observable effects also allows us to take a peek inside the `` black box '' that is postulated in so many approaches to quantum computation . in particular , it is possible to identify the features of quantum coherence and entanglement more directly with the experimentally accessible data by identifying mathematical expansions that fit the specific features of the quantum process under investigation .",
    "hopefully , this is only a first step towards a better understanding of the still somewhat mysterious nature of quantum information processes .",

    "<S> it is therefore necessary to identify the essential features that indicate quantum coherent operation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that an efficient characterization of an experimental device can be obtained by investigating the classical logic operations on a pair of complementary basis sets . </S>",
    "<S> it is then possible to obtain reliable predictions about the quantum coherent operations of the gate such as entanglement generation and bell state discrimination even without performing these operations directly . </S>"
