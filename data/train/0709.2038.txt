    "the formulation of quantum mechanics based on bohm s trajectories ( de broglie 1926 , bohm 1952a , b ) has attracted considerable interest in recent years because it offers a powerful tool to visualize quantum processes in terms of quantum orbits . according to the bohmian interpretation ( see bohm and hiley 1993 and holland 1993 for reviews ) the particles are guided by the schrdinger field via deterministic equations of motion . in this approach the moving particles , together with the schrdinger field ,",
    "form the basic ingredients of objective realilty at the quantum level . on the other hand , in orthodox quantum mechanics the orbits",
    "do not refer to deterministic particles motions , but they represent the streamlines of the probability current @xmath0 ( we set @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus they represent a ` lagrangian ' ( holland 2005 ) or ` hydrodynamical ' ( madelung 1926 ) description of the quantum probability flow , while the schrdinger equation yields the eulerian description of the same flow . at any rate ,",
    "the descriptive power of the bohmian approach is independent of its ontological interpretation .",
    "in fact , applications of bohm s trajectories in the literature have so far successfully addressed such basic quantum processes as the two - slit experiment ( phillipidis 1979 ) , the spin measurement via stern - gerlach devices ( dewdney et al . 1986 ) , tunneling through potential barriers ( hirschfelder et al .",

    "1963 ) , etc .",
    "( see wyatt 2005 for a review of applications of quantum dynamics with trajectories ) .    in the present paper we focus on one particular aspect of bohm s theory that refers to the distinction of the bohmian trajectories into _ regular and chaotic_. a number of studies in the literature ( e.g. drr et al .",

    "the regular or chaotic character of the quantum mechanical orbits does not necessarily correlate with the character of the classical orbits of the same system , i.e. , there are examples of systems with classically regular and quantum mechanically chaotic orbits , or vice versa ( see efthymiopoulos and contopoulos 2006 for a review ) .",
    "\\b ) the emergence of chaos is associated with the existence of ` nodal points ' in the configuration space ,",
    "i.e. , points of the configuration space at which the schrdinger field becomes null . in some particular examples it has been possible to identify a mechanism by which the approach of an orbit near a nodal point introduces chaos ( makowski et al .",
    "2000 , wisniaski and pujals 2005 ) .",
    "however the general problem of the mechanism of transition from order to chaos for the bohmian orbits is still largely unexplored .",
    "\\c ) in some cases it has been shown that the extent of chaos is related to the number and spatial distribution of the nodal points in the configuration space ( frisk 1997 , wisniacki et al .",
    "however , in other cases we find the manifestation of strong chaos even if only one nodal point is present .",
    "this problem is important because it has been shown that , when the degree of chaos is large , it is possible to obtain an asymptotic convergence of the distribution @xmath2 of an ensemble of bohmian trajectories to born s rule @xmath3 , via a bohm - vigier ( 1954 ) stochastic mechanism ( valentini and westman 2005 , efthymiopoulos and contopoulos 2006 ) , without having to postulate this rule .",
    "our purpose in the present paper is to study how the transition from regular to chaotic motion takes place by considering the orbits of a very simple quantum system , namely the superposition of three eigenstates in a hamiltonian system of two independent harmonic oscillators .",
    "parmenter and valentine ( 1995,1996 ) demonstrated that when the two oscillator frequencies are incommensurable , the configuration space is filled by both regular and chaotic orbits ( the initial claim that all the orbits were chaotic ( parmenter and valentine 1995 ) was corrected by parmenter and valentine ( 1996 ) , and by efthymiopoulos and contopoulos ( 2006 ) ) .",
    "the same coexistence was found by wisniacki and pujals ( 2005 ) when the frequencies are commensurable but the ampitudes of the superposed eigenfunctions have a complex ratio , and by konkel and makowski ( 1998 ) in the case of a particle in a box with infinite walls . in the above cases",
    "there is only one nodal point which influences the orbits and introduces chaos .",
    "our aim below is , then , to study the transition from order to chaos from two different points of view : a ) topologically , i.e. we seek to distinguigh which domains of initial conditions lead to regular or chaotic motion and what theoretical criteria can be devised in order to separate these domains , and b ) dynamically , i.e. , we seek to identify the dynamical mechanism behind the transition from order to chaos .",
    "the following is an outline of the paper and of the main results :    \\a ) section 2 contains a proof of the existence of domains in configuration space where nodal points can not appear . in our considered example",
    "the size of these domains depends on the relative amplitudes of the three eigenfunctions and specific quantitative estimates of this dependence are given , which are compared to numerical results .",
    "\\b ) in their domain of analyticity ( i.e. far from nodal points ) , the equations of motion admit solutions expandable in series of a properly defined small parameter ( section 3 ) . the series terms can be determined by an iterative algorithm .",
    "the resulting solutions define theoretical orbits which are , by definition , regular .",
    "the theoretical orbits explain all the basic characteristics of the regular orbits as found by numerical integration .",
    "in particular they explain the frequencies , the form , the limits and the inner deflections of regular orbits .",
    "\\c ) section 4 passes to the other limit , of motion , close to the nodal points . in order to unravel the mechanism",
    "by which the orbits approaching the nodal point become chaotic , the key point is to take into account the motion of the nodal point itself by passing to a description of the orbits in a _ moving _ frame of reference centered at the ( moving ) nodal point .",
    "the main characteristics of the orbits in this frame are found by expansions of the equations of motion in terms of a new small parameter , i.e. , the distance @xmath4 from the nodal point .",
    "the angular frequency of motion near the nodal point is of order @xmath5 , a fact allowing us to use an adiabatic approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "the flow lines near the nodal point are spirals terminating at the nodal point . however , the flow further away from the nodal point is quite complicated and it is studied in detail . in particular , we demonstrate how this flow is related to the manifestation of chaos in the system .",
    "the main results are derived theoretically and then substantiated by detailed numerical experiments .",
    "\\d ) finally , we discuss ( section 5 ) how do our results compare with previous works in the literature on nodal points , and we end with the conclusions ( section 6 ) .",
    "we study the quantum orbits in the hamiltonian model of two uncoupled oscillators : @xmath6 when the guiding field is the superposition of three stationary states ( parmenter and valentine 1995 ) : @xmath7 the equations of motion ( de broglie 1926 , bohm 1952a ) are @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the imaginary part of each of the components of the vector @xmath10 , or @xmath11 with @xmath12 the equations of motion ( [ eqmo ] ) become singular whenever @xmath13 . from ( [ gi ] )",
    "we then find the equations of the nodal points : @xmath14 when the frequency @xmath15 is a rational number , the nodal points describe periodic motions in the configuration space @xmath16 , along a finite number of _ nodal lines _ ( figure 1a ) .",
    "however , when @xmath15 is irrational there is an infinite number of nodal lines that fill open domains of the space @xmath16 ( figure 1b ) .",
    "as shown in section 3 , a theoretical approximation of the regular orbits can be obtained in the complement of the domain of nodal lines .",
    "we thus first provide , in this section , rigorous bounds for the domain of nodal lines .",

    "the main conclusion is that there is a central domain , with boundary defined by the innermost arcs of limiting hyperbolae , that is never crossed by nodal points .",
    "there is also an outer domain , at large distances from the center , which is again prohibited to nodal points . by calculating many orbits",
    ", our numerical evidence is that the orbits lying within these domains are regular .",
    "in particular , we now turn our attention to the analytical determination of the regular orbits for the central domain free of nodal points .",
    "according to the analysis of the previous section , a lower bound for the distance of a nodal point @xmath71 from the origin @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , and @xmath78 corresponding to the closest approach of the innermost limiting hyperbola ( eq.([casedun1 ] ) ) to the origin , i.e. @xmath79 or @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",

    "the whole space is free of nodal points .",
    "this implies that if we look for analytic solutions of the equations of motion ( [ eqmo ] ) , i.e. , free of singularities in the neighborhood of the origin , we may consider @xmath17 in eq.([gi ] ) as small parameters , and expand @xmath88 in eq.([eqmo ] ) in a power series of these parameters .",
    "this results in solutions @xmath89 where the functions @xmath90 , @xmath91 are of order @xmath92 in the amplitudes @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "the convergence of these series , which are of the form of the ` third integral ' ( contopoulos 1960 ) , is an open problem .",
    "however , our numerical evidence below is that the form of theoretical orbits derived by these series fits well the form of the numerical orbits for small parameters @xmath17 .    in the zeroth order approximation",
    "all the solutions are equilibria @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "this corresponds to the limit @xmath95 , in which the guiding @xmath96field is a bound stationary state , and all the quantum orbits are neutral equilibria . on the other hand , when higher order terms are taken into account , eqs.([xyexpand ] ) can be inverted , and , provided that the series converge , they yield the integrals of motion @xmath97 implying that the resulting orbits are , by definition , regular .    the solutions ( [ xyexpand ] ) are found recursively , i.e. , order by order , giving @xmath98 as explicit trigonometric expressions in @xmath99 , with two basic frequencies @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    the first order equations read @xmath102 and they can be readily integrated yielding @xmath103 where @xmath104 are integration constants .",
    "since we wish to absorb the whole dependence of the solution on the initial conditions in the @xmath105 part of the solution , we select the values of @xmath104 such that @xmath106 .    in a similar way we treat the second order equations , finding the solutions @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "the integration constants @xmath109 are also given values such that @xmath110 .",
    "we can prove the _ consistency _ of the above construction , i.e. , that no secular terms can appear in the above recursive scheme .",
    "the proof follows by induction : if the solutions @xmath111 , @xmath112 contain only cosine terms ( of the form @xmath113 with @xmath114 integer , then , the expansion @xmath115 @xmath116^k + \\ldots\\ ] ] with @xmath117 contains only powers of cosine terms , yielding again only cosine terms since @xmath118 @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the equations of motion in order @xmath120 yield only sine terms , since @xmath88 in eqs.([eqmo ] ) is multiplied only by sine terms and @xmath121 @xmath122 .",
    "if for some terms we have @xmath123 , @xmath124 , the sine terms produced in the equations of motion are @xmath125 , or @xmath126 . if ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) , or , @xmath15 is rational and equal to @xmath129 , one of the sine terms in the equation of motion becomes equal to zero ( resonance ) .",
    "however , the resonances do not create any secular term in the _ solutions _ of the equations since the associated terms simply disappear from the r.h.s of eqs.([eqmo ] ) .",
    "thus , the equations in the next order give @xmath130 and @xmath131 as sums of sine terms , and it follows that , if @xmath132 and @xmath133 are sums of cosine terms , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are also sums of cosine terms .",

    "the former condition ensures that for @xmath17 sufficiently small a regular orbit does not overlap with the domain of nodal lines .",
    "this is because the amplitudes of oscillations are @xmath149 and @xmath150 in the @xmath151 and @xmath152 axes respectively ( eqs.([h2sol1 ] ) ) , while the minimum distance of a nodal point from the center is of order @xmath153 ( section 2 ) .",
    "numerically we find such regular orbits for @xmath17 as high as @xmath72 ( figure 3a ) .",
    "however , the oposite is not true , namely an orbit overlaping partly with the domain of nodal lines may still be regular ( figure 3b ) .",
    "in fact , we find numerically that while there is a spatial overlap of the domains of the orbit and of the nodal lines , the time evolution of both the orbit and the nodal point is such that their distance is always large ( of order unity ) .",
    "thus when an orbit enters some region containing nodal lines the nodal point is far from this region .",
    "however , we also find numerically that if an orbit has significant overlap with the domain of nodal lines , the orbit is , in general , chaotic ( figure 3c ) .",
    "\\c ) in the lowest approximation , when @xmath154 the theoretical orbits are ` box orbits ' ( eqs.([h2sol1 ] ) ) like in the classical case .",
    "however , when higher order terms are taken into account , some box orbits develop deflections internal to the box , while other box orbits have deflections only at the boxes limits , depending on the value of @xmath105 .",
    "a simple example is provided by orbits starting on the axis @xmath155 .",
    "then , the equations of the orbits are simplified considerably .",
    "we have , up to second order : @xmath156-{a^2x_0\\over 2}[\\cos 2t-1 ] - \\nonumber\\\\ & & { b^2cx_0\\over ( 1+c)^2}[\\cos((1+c)t)-1]+ { b^2cx_0\\over 4(1+c)^2}[\\cos(2(1+c)t)-1]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath157 \\nonumber\\\\ & -&{abc^{1/2}\\over 1+c}[\\cos((1+c)t)-1 ] + { ab\\over 2c^{1/2}}[\\cos(ct)-1 ] \\\\ & -&{abc^{1/2}\\over 2+c}(x_0 ^ 2-{1\\over 2})[\\cos((2+c)t)-1]~~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq.([h2solxy0 ] ) the first order term @xmath158 $ ] depends only on @xmath82 , yielding an oscillation of amplitude @xmath159 , while in eq.([h2solyy0 ] ) , the first order term @xmath160/(1+c)$ ] depends on both @xmath83 and @xmath161 . for all initial conditions with @xmath162 , this term is dominant over the second order terms in eq.([h2solyy0 ] ) .",
    "thus the orbit is a deformed parallelogram , i.e. , it resembles to classical box orbits ( figure 4a , b , c ) . on the other hand , if @xmath163 , this term becomes small , while the second order terms , not depending on @xmath161 , become now important .",
    "this means that secondary oscillations of the function @xmath146 are developed , that may also yield local minima or maxima besides the main minimum or maximum defined by the first order fourier component of ( [ h2solyy0 ] ) .",
    "this causes the orbit to develop deflections in the @xmath164 direction inside the box .",
    "a numerical example of this behavior is demonstrated in figs .",
    "4d , e , f .",
    "figure 5 shows some further examples of theoretical orbits calculated by the above series , via a computer program implementing the recursive algorithm up to the 10th order . as expected in any kind of perturbative series , as @xmath17 increase one needs higher order terms to obtain a good approximation of the orbits .",
    "in fact , as already analyzed , the approximation depends also on the values of the initial conditions @xmath105 which appear in the amplitudes of the trigonometric terms of eqs.([h2sol1 ] ) , ( [ h2sol2x ] ) and ( [ h2sol2y ] ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath165 , the theoretical orbit for @xmath166 ( fig.5a , b ) fits well the numerical orbit , while if the series are truncated at orders well below 10 the agreement is not so good . on the other hand for the same amplitudes",
    "@xmath17 the fit is not good when @xmath167 ( fig.5c , d ) .",
    "now , in any perturbation theory the analytical results are precise up to values of the small parameters smaller than the values for which regular orbits are found numerically .",
    "thus , in our case we find that for amplitudes larger than @xmath168 the approximation of the numerical orbits by series yields no longer accurate results , despite the fact that we still find numerically many regular orbits .",
    "having demonstrated the existence of regular orbits far from the nodal points , we now examine the motion in the other limit , i.e. , close to a nodal point .",
    "our main remark in the sequel is that the phenomena relevant to the transition to chaos are unraveled when one considers the passage of the orbits in the neighborhood of the nodal point in a _ moving _ frame of reference that is centered at the nodal point . introducing @xmath169 , @xmath170 ,",
    "the equations of motion in the moving frame read : @xmath171 where @xmath172 with @xmath173 and @xmath174 are found by differentiating @xmath161 , @xmath175 with respect to time in ( eq.([nodal ] ) .",
    "we then consider the distance @xmath176 of an orbit from the nodal point as a small parameter and derive the main characteristics of the motion by taking expansions of the equations of motion ( [ equv1 ] ) in powers of @xmath177 , i.e. , by considering both @xmath178 and @xmath179 as @xmath180 . in polar",
    "coordinates @xmath181 , @xmath182 , the equations ( [ equv1 ] ) read : @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are readily specified from eq.([g234 ] ) ( see appendix for explicit formulae ) .    to the leading order ( @xmath186 ) , the second of eqs.([eqpol ] ) yields : @xmath187",
    "thus , the angular velocity around the nodal point is large ( of order @xmath5 ) and the period can be made arbitrarily small by approaching closer and closer to the nodal point .",
    "this fact justifies the use of the _ adiabatic approximation _ in the study of the motions near the nodal point .",
    "that is , at a given initial time @xmath188 we set @xmath189 , with @xmath190 , and find @xmath191 now , the denominator in the r.h.s . of eq.([eqphi2 ] ) is equal to the square of the length of one diagonal of the parallelepiped with sides @xmath192,@xmath193 forming an angle @xmath194 , thus it is always positive .",
    "it follows that @xmath195 and @xmath196 have a unique sign during a whole period of @xmath197 , which is the same as the sign of @xmath198 .",
    "that is , at a given time @xmath188 , the angular motions close to the nodal point are all described in the same sense .    in the same approximation",
    "we can now determine the form of the integral curves of the velocity vector field ( [ equv1 ] ) .",
    "dividing the first with the second of eqs.([eqpol ] ) , and setting a constant @xmath188 in the place of @xmath99 in the r.h.s .",
    "yields the equation of the integral curves , which is of the form : @xmath199 the precise functions @xmath200 , @xmath201 are given in the appendix .",
    "at this point it suffices to state that both functions contain only trigonometric terms in @xmath197 . if we expand eq.([dspir ] ) with respect to @xmath202 we find : @xmath203 with @xmath204 rescaling the radial distance as @xmath205 , with @xmath206 , eq.([dspir2 ] ) takes the form : @xmath207 this equation satisfies the neccesary conditions for applying the averaging theorem ( e.g. verhulst 1993 ) .",
    "this implies that there is a near - identity transformation @xmath208 such that the dynamics in terms of @xmath209 is given by : @xmath210 where @xmath211 after some algebra ( see appendix ) we find that @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",

    "if @xmath15 is rational but @xmath380 is real , all the orbits are periodic and neutrally stable , thus there is no chaos at all ( some examples of seemingly chaotic orbits in a similar model given by konkel and makowski ( 1998 ) , for a rational value of @xmath15 , are just due to numerical errors caused by the stiffness of the equations of motion close to the x - point . in order to obtain the correct orbits , which are periodic and not chaotic",
    ", we had to use a program in mathematica with an accuracy of 50 digits ! ) .",
    "falsaperla and fonte ( 2003 ) studied the orbits near nodal lines in a 3d model . in that case",
    "the orbits describe helical motions around the nodal line ( called by these authors ` spirals ' ) while the projections of the motion on a @xmath381constant surface are ellipses .",
    "these authors point out that the nodal lines `` regularize the motion '' in their neighborhood , and only orbits not following a definite nodal line are `` intermittent chaotic '' .",
    "they furthermore find too that the period of rotation along the helix is of order @xmath382 , where @xmath177 in this case is the distance from the nodal line .",
    "while a detailed comparison of 2d and 3d models is necessary , our analysis above shows essentially why the growth of the deviation vectors is intermittent , i.e. , it takes place by abrupt steps whenever an orbit approaches the nodal point - x - point complex .",
    "furthermore , we also explain why the appearance of chaos is _ not _ strictly correlated with very close approaches to the nodal point ( in such cases the orbits simply spiral around the nodal point ) , but it occurs mainly when the orbit approaches closely the x - point associated with the nodal point .",
    "this happens even if the latter has a distance from the nodal point which is much larger than the distance of the orbit from the x - point .",
    "wu and sprung ( 1999 ) gave plots ( their fig.4 ) of the probability flow , which resemble our figure 7 .",
    "however , this resemblence is only due to a ` phase mixing ' phenomenon taking place in the rest frame near the nodal point .",
    "namely , because the rotation frequency depends on the distance from the nodal point as @xmath186 , a fluid element of some thickness approaching the nodal point forms a number of windings around the nodal point due to the differential rotation of the orbits included in its area .",
    "these windings give the impression of forming a spiral pattern , which is , however , only apparent , namely the windings are limited by an inner circle ( or ellipse ) due to orbits of the fluid element closest to the nodal point ( this is different from our limit circle of fig.12 ) . on the other hand , in earlier works the same authors found spiral motions around quantum vortices in the _ rest frame _ of motion , when the quantum system is subject to a vector potential in addition to a scalar potential ( wu and sprung 1994 ) .",
    "the plots shown in that work are similar to ours , although the similarity in the topological structure of the phase space is due to the presence of an extra term in the equations of motion due to the vector potential , rather than to the motion of the nodal point .    finally , frisk ( 1997 ) and wisniacki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) noticed that the transition to chaos is enhanced when there are many co - existing vortices influencing the orbits . in that case",
    "it is necessary to consider the connections of the invariant manifolds emanating from the stationary points of one vortex with those of other vortices and see how this can increase chaos and transport phenomena in configuration space .",
    "this problem is proposed for future study .",
    "in summary , the main conclusions of our study are the following :    \\1 ) in a simple quantum system consisting of the superposition of three eigenstates of the double harmonic oscillator potential , in which there is one nodal point of the wavefunction travelling in the plane @xmath16 , we proved the existence of domains of this plane which are free of nodal points .",
    "bohmian orbits in these domains , as well as orbits slightly overlapping with the nodal lines , are regular .",
    "\\2 ) in the central domain devoid of nodal lines the equations of motion admit expansions in powers of the probability amplitudes of the eigenstates , yielding the trajectories as double fourier series in the fundamental frequencies of the system .",
    "these series represent theoretical orbits which are , by definition , regular .",
    "we show the agreement of the theoretical and numerical orbits in this domain for sufficiently small values of the probability amplitudes and sufficiently high order of the expansions , and use this to explain the morphological characteristics of the regular orbits .",
    "\\3 ) close to the nodal points , we use different expansions , in powers of the distance from the nodal point , in order to unravel the dynamics .",
    "the angular frequency of motion in a @xmath383 neighborhood of the nodal point is of order @xmath5 .",
    "this justifies the use of the adiabatic approximation . in the fixed frame",
    "@xmath16 the flow lines close to the nodal point are ellipses .",
    "however , in a _ moving _ frame attached to the nodal point , the flow lines are spirals terminating at the nodal point .",
    "the temporary sense of description of the spirals by the orbits is unique , i.e. , at a given time the nodal point is either an attractor or a repellor .",
    "furthermore , at a finite distance from the nodal point there is a saddle stationary point of the flow with one asymptotic manifold joining the spiral and the other three extending to infinity .",
    "\\4 ) the eigenvalues of the x - point scale as @xmath384 where @xmath256 is the distance of the x - point from the nodal point and @xmath385 . furthermore",
    ", the distance @xmath256 can be arbitrarily small , i.e. , there are collisions of the x- and nodal points .",
    "we show that the orbits approaching close to the x - point exhibit exponential growth of their deviations , i.e. , they are chaotic . in all numerical examples",
    "we find that chaos is associated with the approach of the orbits to the x - point , which , however , is only guaranteed when we have a moving nodal point .",
    "furthermore the chaotic influence of the x - point on the orbits is strongest when the x - point is closest to the nodal point .",
    "thus , the nodal point indirectly influences the transition of bohm s trajectories from order to chaos via the above mechanism .",
