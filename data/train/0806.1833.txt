    "* the topic of this paper unifies two principal directions of nonlinear science : coupled self - sustained oscillators and soliton theory .",
    "coupled autonomous self - sustained oscillators appear in different fields of science , they demonstrate a variety of fascinating phenomena . in this study",
    "we demonstrate that particularities of the coupling for a rather simple setup  all oscillators are identical , periodic , and form a regular lattice with a nearest neighbor coupling  can lead to highly nontrivial wave structures . remarkably , a dispersive coupling of the phases of dissipative oscillators results in a simple lattice equation which is equivalent to a hamiltonian one .",
    "we show that different types of traveling waves exist in this lattice : compactons ( ultra - localized waves with a compact support ) , usual solitary waves with exponential tails , as well as the corresponding kink - type solutions .",
    "these waves appear from rather general initial conditions and exist for long times .",
    "after very long transients they are destroyed due to inelastic collisions and evolve into phase chaos . *    coupled autonomous oscillators are subject of high interest in nonlinear science  @xcite .",
    "when the coupling of the oscillators is weak , they can be described in the phase approximation  @xcite , where only a variation of the oscillator phases matters .",
    "the corresponding models are used for the description of lattices  @xcite , globally coupled ensembles and networks  @xcite . in the absence of coupling ,",
    "the phase equations have only zero lyapunov exponents , therefore whether the phase dynamics is dissipative or conservative depends solely on the properties of the coupling . in studies which focus on synchronization properties ,",
    "one typically assumes that the coupling is dissipative which thus tends to equalize the phases .",
    "however , certain types of coupling lead to a conservative dynamics ",
    "a prominent example is a splay state in a globally coupled ensemble of oscillators  @xcite .    in the present work we consider the dynamics of a one - dimensional lattice of oscillators with a dispersive , conservative coupling .",
    "a realization of such a lattice may be a multi - core fiber laser  @xcite , where individual self - oscillating lasers are arranged in a ring , or an array of josephson junctions .",
    "since both , the local phase dynamics and the coupling are non - dissipative , the dynamics is expected to be similar to that of the well - known hamiltonian type .",
    "an example of a hamiltonian lattice is the sine - gordon lattice , for which the basic building blocks are traveling solitary waves like pulses or kinks , that on integrable lattices collide elastically , and in the non - integrable cases evolve into chaos  @xcite .    in recent years two new concepts appeared",
    "that have significantly extended our understanding of nonlinear regimes in hamiltonian lattices .",
    "one concept introduces localized periodic breathers  @xcite ; the other introduces compact excitations in genuinely nonlinear lattices and wave equations . unlike the usual solitons that have exponential , or algebraic , tails , the corresponding traveling waves have compact or almost compact support .",
    "these waves , named * compactons * , have been introduced in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study general traveling waves in a chain of dispersively coupled nonlinear self - sustained oscillators , continuing our previous works  @xcite focused on compacton solutions in phase oscillator chains .",
    "contrary to @xcite , we consider here a generic phase model without additional symmetries . we show that dispersively coupled oscillators possess not only compactons , but also `` classical '' solitary waves with exponential tails . in dependence on parameters of the coupling and on the velocity these solution bifurcate .",
    "remarkably , some of the compact solutions described in @xcite exist only in the symmetric situation , while other can be continued to the non - symmetric case . in the general ,",
    "non - symmetric case , we describe a novel type of semi - compact waves which are compact from only one side and have an exponential tail on the other side .",
    "another novel feature appears in the analysis of traveling waves on the lattice : here we describe a particular bifurcation from monotonic to oscillatory tails of a solitary wave , such a bifurcation does not exist in the quasicontinuous approximation where waves are described by means of a partial differential equation .",
    "we also report on a remarkable property of the solitary waves with exponential tails : they are extremely stable to collisions , so that a chaotization in a finite lattice occurs  contrary to the case of compactons  after exponentially long transients .",
    "we consider the phase dynamics of a chain of identical self - sustained oscillators with frequency @xmath0 @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the phase of the @xmath3-th oscillator and @xmath4 is the coupling function .",
    "hereafter , we assume that this function is even , what corresponds to dispersive coupling , see @xcite for details . introducing the phase differences @xmath5 equation ( [ eq : phases ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath6    the simplest possible even @xmath7-periodic coupling function is @xmath8 ; this case was studied in @xcite , where it was shown , that compactons and kovatons ( glued together compact kink - antikink pairs ) are solutions arising out of the background @xmath9 . here , we extend the results of @xcite and demonstrate that this lattice also bears periodic waves and solitons , as well as semi - compact waves . in @xcite",
