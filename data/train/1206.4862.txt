    "synchronization is an important phenomenon that occurs in many biological and physical systems @xcite . in the brain , the rhythmic oscillations of concerted electrical activity , which are representative for the synchronous firing of neurons ,",
    "have been observed in different regions , including the neocortex , hippocampus and thalamus @xcite . since",
    "neural oscillations are associated with many high - level brain functions , the pertinent research has attracted considerable attention in the past decades @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that these oscillations not only carry information by themselves , but that they may also regulate the flow of information and assist by its storage and retrieval in neural circuits @xcite .    in the brain , fast - spiking interneurons",
    "are mutually connected by both inhibitory chemical synapses as well as electrical synapses ( gap junctions ) @xcite .",
    "the evidence is mounting that networks composed of fast - spiking interneurons could provide synchronization mechanisms by means of which important rhythmic activities , such as the gamma ( @xmath0 : 25 - 100 hz ) rhythm and the mixed theta ( @xmath1 : 4 - 12hz ) and gamma rhythm @xcite , can be generated .",
    "computational studies indicate that inhibitory and electrical synapses play an important role by the generation of these oscillations .",
    "for example , it has been shown that interneuronal networks with solely inhibitory synapses can produce gamma oscillations , but that adding gap junctions to the network can further increases their stability and coherence @xcite .",
    "it has also been reported that interneuronal networks coupled by both fast and slow inhibitory synapses can produce the mixed theta and gamma rhythmic activity @xcite .",
    "in addition , several theoretical studies have been performed to provide a deeper understanding of how the inhibitory and electrical synapses promote synchronization amongst coupled neurons @xcite .",
    "information transmission delays , which are due to the finite propagation speeds and due to time lapses occurring by both dendritic and synaptic processing @xcite , are also an inherent part of neuronal dynamics . in particular",
    "the transmission delays of chemical synapses are not to be neglected @xcite .",
    "physiological experiments have revealed that they can be up to several tenths of milliseconds in length @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the transmission delays introduced by electrical synapses are comparably short , usually not exceeding 0.05 milliseconds @xcite , so they are often not taken explicitly into account . in terms of dynamical complexity , the existence of time delays makes a nonlinear system with a finite number of degrees of freedom become an infinite - dimensional one , which may enrich the dynamics @xcite , enhance synchronization @xcite , and facilitate spatiotemporal pattern formation @xcite .",
    "although existing studies attest clearly to the fact that information transmission delays have a significant impact on the synchronization of interneuronal networks , to the best of our knowledge the focus has always been on considering only short inhibitory synaptic delays @xcite .",
    "however , since as noted above , the delays of chemical synapses may be substantial , it is also of interest to consider long inhibitory synaptic delays . given that previous studies have shown that different time delay lengths may have rather different effects on the synchronization of coupled nonlinear oscillators @xcite , we anticipate that the consideration of long inhibitory synaptic delays may lead to new and inspiring results .",
    "to resolve this , we here study the synchronization in an interneuronal network that is coupled by both delayed inhibitory as well as fast electrical synapses , focusing specifically on the effects of inhibitory synaptic delays covering a wide window of values .",
    "our simulations reveal that the delayed inhibition not only plays an important role in network synchronization , but that it can also lead to different oscillatory patterns .",
    "the comparatively fast gap - junctional coupling , on the other hand , contributes solely to the synchronization of the network but does not affect the emergence of oscillatory patterns .",
    "most interestingly , we show that a sufficiently long inhibitory synaptic delay induces a rapid transition from the one - frequency to the two - frequency state , thus leading to the occurrence of a mixed oscillatory pattern .",
    "moreover , we also show that the unreliability of inhibitory synapses has a significant impact on both the synchronization and the emergence of oscillatory patterns .",
    "our findings thus add to the established relevance of time delays in neuronal networks and highlight the importance of synaptic mechanisms for the generation of synchronized neural oscillations .",
    "the reminder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we present the mathematical model and introduce the synchronization measure .",
    "main results are presented in section  [ sec:3 ] , while in section  [ sec:4 ] we summarize our work and briefly discuss potential biological implications of our findings .",

    "for sufficiently strong @xmath71 , the measure @xmath48 approaches 1 , indicating that the synchronization is almost perfect . indeed , several previous studies have concluded that gap - junctional coupling is more effective than chemical coupling in leading to highly synchronized states @xcite .",

    "[ fig:2 ] reveal also that the oscillatory pattern is largely influenced by the inhibitory synaptic delay . for suitably short values of @xmath63 a regular oscillatory pattern can be observed .",
    "interestingly however , if the delay @xmath63 is sufficiently long , we can observe the emergence of a mixed oscillatory pattern , which implies that there are two main oscillation frequencies present in the network .",
    "one is the low frequency of the whole mixed oscillatory pattern and the other is the high frequency of the fast oscillations within each periodic cycle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . theoretically , the mixed oscillatory pattern appears only for sufficiently long inhibitory synaptic delay . under this condition ,",
    "neurons in the synchronized or near - synchronized network have enough time to fire more than once during a whole periodic cycle , before the inhibitory synaptic currents caused by the first synchronous spiking group within the same periodic cycle start to suppress their firing .",
    "obviously , the longer the inhibitory synaptic delay @xmath63 , the more groups of synchronous spikes might be contained in each periodic cycle ( see @xmath76 and 30 ms in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and [ fig:2](b ) ) .",
    "moreover , once the inhibitory synaptic currents caused by the first synchronous spiking group start to have effect , these currents tend to decrease the membrane potentials of neurons and prolong their firing period . in this case , the following inhibitory synaptic bombardments due to one or more synchronous spiking groups from the same periodic cycle will further suppress neuronal firings , and therefore the neurons in the network can fire again only after these inhibitory effects wear down or become fully absent .",
    "this provides a viable mechanism for the emergence of the low - frequency component in the mixed oscillatory pattern . while performing additional simulations , we have discovered that without the long delayed inhibitory synapses , networks of interneurons can not generate the mixed oscillatory pattern even if we consider the non - physiological case of long electrical synaptic delays ( data not shown ) .",
    "the above results thus indicate that the inhibitory synaptic delay serves as an important control parameter for the selection of the oscillatory pattern in the network , and that long inhibitory synaptic delays provide a stable mechanism for the emergence of the mixed oscillatory pattern in interneuronal networks .",
    "we now return to fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) and further discuss the near - periodic oscillatory behavior in @xmath48 .",
    "it can be determined that the frequency of this near - periodic behavior matches with the oscillation frequency of the high - frequency component quite well .",
    "note that we will show later that the oscillation frequency of the high - frequency component is mainly influenced by the parameter @xmath44 . in the narrow regions of @xmath63 where the minima of @xmath48 appear (",
    "note that these regions also correspond to the transition points for the number of synchronously spiking groups contained in each periodic cycle ) , only a limited amount of neurons will participate in the last group of synchronous firings within each periodic cycle ( see the red rectangle in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) ) . this can be attributed to the matching between the synaptic delay @xmath63 and the high - frequency component , which ultimately causes the near - periodic behavior in the synchronization measure @xmath48 .",
    "we have also performed additional numerical simulations by using other models of neuronal dynamics , such as the model by izhikevich with fast - spiking dynamics @xcite and the standard hodgkin - huxley model @xcite , and we have observed qualitatively identical results , thus confirming the generality of this phenomenon ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , our results also reveal that the fast gap - junctional coupling tends to suppress the occurrence of such near - periodic oscillations , which may be attributed to the overall promotion of synchronization ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) ) .",
    "indeed , if the electrical coupling is sufficiently strong this phenomenon disappears altogether because then the neurons in the network are perfectly synchronized .",
    "in addition to the time delay @xmath63 , we also find that the synchronization depends significantly on the other two important inhibitory synaptic parameters , which are the strength @xmath72 and the time constant @xmath44 .",
    "figures  [ fig:4](a ) and [ fig:4](b ) depict the synchronization measure @xmath48 as a function of @xmath44 for different values of @xmath72 , without ( @xmath59 ) and with ( @xmath67 ) the fast electrical synapses , respectively . in the absence of fast gap - junctional coupling",
    ", there exists an optimal region of @xmath44 in each depicted dependence of @xmath48 , which implies that the network can support synchronization optimally only for intermediate values of @xmath44 ( see also @xcite for related results ) . in this case",
    ", a strong inhibitory synaptic strength can drive the network towards a high - level of synchronization at the corresponding optimal value of @xmath44 .",
    "however , with the increasing of @xmath72 , it can also be observed that the top plateau region of the @xmath48 curve becomes narrower and shifts to the left ( the direction of short @xmath44 ) .",
    "an explanation why longer @xmath44 can no longer produce high values of @xmath48 is as follows .",
    "due to the heterogeneity of connectivity , some neurons in the considered network will have more inhibitory synaptic inputs than others . for long @xmath44",
    ", the slowly decaying synaptic inhibition accumulates in time and thus may lead to a tonic level of hyperpolarizing currents that cancel the external depolarizing currents by neurons with more inhibitory inputs @xcite .",
    "this will suppress or even fully disable the firing of such neurons , which in turn means that if the synaptic time constant is too long , the synchronization will deteriorate significantly . at a fixed @xmath44 ,",
    "a large value of @xmath72 will introduce more inhibition to the network , and thus a relatively shorter @xmath44 will be needed to impair synchronization . as a result , although strong @xmath72 can enhance the synchronization in the corresponding optimal @xmath44 region , they may also reduce the size of this region . on the other hand , adding the fast gap - junctional coupling to the network , as expected ,",
    "will enhance the synchronous firing of neurons .",
    "this enhancement is quite remarkable , even if the gap - junctional coupling is rather weak , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) .",
    "further increasing the strength of gap - junctional coupling can lead to the perfect synchronization ( data not shown ) .",
    "several previous experiments have shown that some of the inhibitory synapses between interneurons can have rather slow synaptic kinetics @xcite .",
    "therefore , to some extent , our results suggest that the fast electrical synapses might be essential for taming desynchronization if an interneuronal network contains a considerable number of slow inhibitory synapses .",

    "different colors ( shades of gray ) refer to different numbers of synchronously spiking groups contained in each periodic cycle.,width=332 ]    figure  [ fig:5 ] shows how the oscillation frequency depends on the inhibitory synaptic delay for different levels of inhibition .",
    "as can be observed , the oscillation frequency of the considered interneuronal network is determined by both the inhibitory synaptic delay as well as the inhibition . in the short @xmath63 region ,",
    "the oscillations are characterized by a single frequency . in this case , increasing @xmath72 and @xmath44 can reduce the oscillation frequency from the @xmath0 band to @xmath1 band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "once @xmath63 exceeds a critical time delay @xmath79 , we observe that the network oscillations transit from the one - frequency state to the two - frequency state , indicating the emergence of the mixed oscillatory pattern .",
    "this transition is rapid and stable with the aid of fast gap - junctional coupling . for the mixed oscillatory pattern ,",
    "our results show that both @xmath72 and @xmath44 influence the low - frequency component , but only @xmath44 has a significant effect on the high - frequency component .",
    "when @xmath44 is short , the inhibitory synaptic currents from one periodic cycle decay fast , so that they may completely vanish before the firing of neurons enters into the next periodic cycle and almost do not influence the neuronal firing in the next periodic cycle . thus , in this case , the critical time delay @xmath79 is approximately 12.5 ms , and based on the same reason , the number of synchronous spiking groups contained in each periodic cycle is also increased once about every 12.5 ms .",
    "the above analysis suggests that the oscillation frequency of the high - frequency component is around 80 hz ( in the @xmath0 band ) for short @xmath44 ( see @xmath80 ms in fig  [ fig:5 ] ) , corresponding to the firing rate of a single wang - buzsaki neuron that is driven solely by the considered externally applied current .",
    "if @xmath44 is sufficiently long , the inhibitory synaptic currents from one periodic cycle can persist to a certain extent even after the neuronal firing enters into the next periodic cycle .",
    "these remaining inhibitory synaptic currents will suppress the neuronal firing in the next periodic cycle , and thus increase the firing interval between the first and the second synchronous spiking groups in the next periodic cycle .",
    "therefore , the firing intervals of the high - frequency component are not perfectly identical , i.e. , the first firing interval is slighter larger than the other firing intervals .",
    "this in turn yields a relatively smaller average frequency of the high - frequency component . as a result ,",
    "for long @xmath44 the system needs a relatively longer @xmath63 to generate the mixed oscillatory pattern , and it also exhibits a slightly smaller frequency in the high - frequency component of its output ( see @xmath81 ms in fig  [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "moreover , our results also show that the frequency of the whole mixed oscillatory pattern is quite low , even in the case of weak inhibition ( small @xmath71 and short values of @xmath44 ) . for sufficiently long values of @xmath63",

    "this fact might have biological implications as these rhythmic activities are frequently associated with fast - spiking interneurons , and are also believed to play prominent functional roles in cognitive tasks @xcite .",
    "lastly , we have also demonstrated that the unreliability of inhibitory synapses plays an important role by the synchronization of the network as well as by the emergence of oscillatory patterns .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that high levels of unreliability destroy synchronization , and that a minimal level of reliability is needed for the emergence and stability of the mixed oscillatory pattern .",
    "we hope that the presented results will improve our understanding of the synaptic mechanisms that are responsible for the generation of synchronous oscillations in the neural tissue . indeed",
    ", our findings suggest that delayed inhibitory synapses are a viable candidate for controlling the emergence of oscillatory patterns . depending on the actual biological circumstances , the same interneuronal ensembles may produce neural oscillations with different patterns in an adaptive way through the modulation of synaptic transmission .",
    "we also hope that this study will inspire further research on this topic , in particular by taking into account additional physiological properties of neuronal networks , such as the anatomical connectivity and distance - dependent synaptic information transmission delays .",
