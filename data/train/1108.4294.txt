    "the correspondence between geometric spaces and commutative algebras is a familiar and basic idea of algebraic geometry .",
    "noncommutative topology started with the famous gelfand - naimark theorems : every commutative c*-algebra is the algebra of continuous functions vanishing at infinity on a locally compact space and vice versa . in particular , a noncommutative c*-algebra may be viewed as `` the algebra of continuous functions vanishing at infinity '' on a `` quantum space '' .",
    "the aim of noncommutative geometry is to develop the basic concepts of topology , measure theory and differential geometry in algebraic terms and then to generalize the corresponding classical results to the setting of noncommutative algebras .",
    "the question whether there is a way to translate the geometric concept of a fibre bundle to noncommutative geometry is quite interesting in this context . in the case of vector bundles a refined version of the theorem of serre and swan @xcite gives the essential clue : the category of vector bundles over a manifold @xmath4 is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective modules over @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to consider finitely generated projective modules over an arbitrary algebra as  noncommutative vector bundles \" .",
    "the case of principal bundles is so far not treated in the same satisfactory way . from a geometrical point of view",
    "it is not sufficiently well understood what a  noncommutative principal bundle \" should be .",
    "still , there are several approaches towards the noncommutative geometry of principal bundles : for example , there is a well - developed abstract algebraic approach known as hopf  galois extensions which uses the theory of hopf algebras ( cf . @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",

    "another topologically oriented approach can be found in @xcite ; here the authors use @xmath6-algebraic methods to develop a theory of principal noncommutative torus bundles based on theorem ( cf .",
    "* corollary 15 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the authors of @xcite introduce @xmath6-algebraic analogs of freeness and properness , since by a classical result ( of differential geometry ) having a free and proper action of a lie group @xmath7 on a manifold @xmath8 is equivalent saying that @xmath8 carries the structure of a principal bundle with structure group @xmath7 . in @xcite",
    "we have developed a geometrically oriented approach to the noncommutative geometry of principal bundles based on dynamical systems and the representation theory of the corresponding transformation groups .",

    "thus , a natural step towards a geometrically oriented theory of  noncommutative principal torus bundles \" is to describe the _ trivial _ objects first , i.e. , to determine and to classify the trivial noncommutative principal torus bundles .",

    "in particular , we show how to endow the corresponding space @xmath58 of sections with a topology that turns it into a ( unital ) locally convex algebra .",
    "the general philosophy here is use the existing results for mapping spaces and reduce the occurring questions of continuity to mapping spaces .",
    "+ in section 5 we finally prove a smooth analogue of proposition [ k(x)_f = o(x_f ) ] for the algebra @xmath5 of smooth functions on some manifold @xmath4 .",

    "in fact , this construction turns out to be the starting point for our approach to noncommutative principal torus bundles : given a principal bundle @xmath9 and an open subset @xmath11 of @xmath4 such that @xmath69 is trivial , we show that the localization of the induced smooth dynamical system @xmath70 around `` @xmath11 '' leads to the smooth dynamical system @xmath71 which is in turn nautrally isomorphic to the smooth dynamical system @xmath72 coming from the trivial principal bundle @xmath73 .",
