    "muon tomography is a geophysical method that offers a new way to determine the density of large rock volumes by measuring their screening effect on the natural cosmic muons flux crossing the rock volume to probe ( e.g. nagamine 2003 , see tanaka 2013 for a brief review ) .",
    "the small cross - section of muons in ordinary matter ( barrett et al . 1952 ) allows the hard component of the muon spectrum ( tang et al . , 2006 ; gaisser & stanev 2008 ) to cross hectometers , and even kilometers , of rock .",
    "most muons crossing the rock volume have a negligible scattering relative to the instrument angular resolution and travel along straight trajectories ranking muon tomography among the class of straight - ray scanning imaging methods ( marteau et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "in practice , muon tomography is performed by using a series of pixelated particle detectors that allow to determine the trajectories of the muons passing through the rock body .",

    ", we extend our methodological work by quantitatively examining how the combination of muon tomography and gravity data may improve the reconstruction of the density distribution inside geological bodies .",

    "combining density radiographies and gravity measurements is a quite natural intention since both methods provide information directly related to the density distribution .",

    "conversely , muon tomography has limitations due to difficulties to install muon telescopes at a large number of places around the geological body to image .",
    "consequently the number of opacity radiographies available to perform the tomography reconstruction is always small with , eventually , wide uncovered angular sectors that make the inverse radon transform ill - posed to perform the tomography reconstruction .",

    "the gravimetry @xmath104 slices clearly reveal the important sensitivity of the data to density variations located in the immediate vicinity of the measurement points and the very low sensitivity to density structure located deeper in the lava dome .",
    "the muon - gravimetry @xmath104 slices confirm the results obtained for points @xmath138 and show the considerable improvement of the resolution obtained when jointly using the muon and gravity datasets .",
    "they also reproduce the asymmetric resolution due to the conical shape of the muon acquisition kernels @xmath64 .",
    "since the places occupied by the telescope are located along the southern edge of the volcano , a finer resolution is obtained for the southern part of the lava dome .",
    "this corresponds to the dark - red circular sector visible in the upper horizontal slice in fig .",
    "[ gammamap_b ] . as expected , the resolution is coarser in the central and northern parts of the dome .",
    "the same slice shows that the north - eastern region of the volcano is resolved by the gravity data alone since no lines of sight of the telescope cross this part of the dome .",
    "the @xmath104 map is a useful tool to plan an acquisition survey .",
    "one can easily compute how @xmath104 is changed with different possible measurement campaigns and select the most pertinent one depending on the region of interest , the available time on the field and the accessibility of the site .",
    "this choice is critical as muon tomography acquisitions are long ( a few weeks ) and gravity measurements delicate .",
    "it can also be used to design a mesh for the problem .",
    "the meshing elements density can roughly follows the @xmath104 map fluctuations .",
    "we emphasize that other definitions may be used for @xmath104 and that a single index may prove insufficient to characterize the shape of resolving kernels .",
    "consequently , we recommend to perform a 3d examination of individual resolving kernels at locations of particular importance ( i.e. like detecting places where density changes occur ) .",
    "the resolving kernel analysis discussed in the present study allows to quantitatively assess the way by which gravity data and density muon radiographies may be joined to reconstruct the density distribution inside geological bodies . a main result concerns the improvement of the resolution obtained in the deep regions of the density model when joining muon and gravity data , and despite the fact that these regions are not sampled by muon tomography .",
    "part of the information brought by the muon data is transferred to the deep regions of the model through the long - range coupling of the gravity acquisition kernels ( fig .",
    "[ acquisitionkernels_a ] ) used to construct the joined resolving kernels ( eq .  ( [ resolvingkernel_5a ] ) ) .",
    "the compact support of the muon acquisition kernels ( fig .  [ acquisitionkernels_b ] ) allows muon tomography to obtain high - resolution models of the density structure of la soufrire but restricted to the upper part of the dome .",
    "gravimetry can not be used on its own to make a proper continuous inversion because it is too sensitive to the very close subsurface . therefore coupling the two techniques",
    "does not lead to significant improvement of the density model in regions where muon data are available ( compare fig .",
    "[ resokernels1_b ] and fig .",
    "[ resokernels1_d ] ) .",
    "the muon tomography acquisition kernel has a conic shape . and",
    "noise considerations obligate us to put the cone apex just in front the studied structure .",
    "it results in a large decrease of the sensitivity between the front and the rear of the volcano .",
    "this problem adds to the heterogeneous tomography sampling and forbid us to use the standard radon transform usually adopted in x - ray tomography medical experiments to inverse the density .",
    "it also shows how deterministic is the telescope position if one desires to image or monitor a specific region belonging to a bigger body .    the positive weight function @xmath73 of the inner product ( eq .",
    "( [ x_scalar_product ] ) ) may be used to introduce prior information both by limiting the support of the density distribution to reconstruct and by introducing a spatial correlation smoothing the @xmath118 effect of muon tomography and gravimetry acquisition kernels .",
    "this extends the range of sensitivity of the measurements and results in a solution with a more homogeneous quality .",
    "finally the @xmath104 maps give an overview of the resolving kernel geometry everywhere in the dome which can easily be used to optimally plan future acquisition surveys with respect to data already available .",
    "this study is part of the anr-14-ce04 - 0001 diaphane project .",
