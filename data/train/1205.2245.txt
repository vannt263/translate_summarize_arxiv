    "<S> e.g. , _ an appropriate combination of ferromagnetism and spin - orbit coupling can lead to nearly flat bands with unit chern number , @xmath0 , in itinerant lattice systems.@xcite given the flat bands , these systems are likely to host interesting strongly correlated states and , at least in theory , this opens up a number of intriguing perspectives including high - temperature fractional quantum hall states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , numerical exact diagonalization studies convincingly show the existence of such states.@xcite while the list of flat band models with @xmath0 is still growing@xcite and a better understanding of the relation between these bands and landau levels@xcite is developing , bands with higher chern number could host qualitatively new phases of matter@xcite as they have no direct analogue in the continuum.@xcite in this context , two very recent papers made interesting progress by introducing models harboring relatively flat bands with @xmath4.@xcite    at the same time there is a tremendous experimental development and theoretical interest in the physics of transition metal oxides , especially the iridates , where the effect of spin - orbit coupling is profound.@xcite among these materials there are examples such as a@xmath5ir@xmath5o@xmath6 ( a is a rare - earth element ) where the relevant effective low - energy degrees of freedom are conducting 5d electrons on the ir@xmath7 ions that live on the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice formed by corner - sharing tetrahedra.@xcite interestingly , an anomalous hall effect has been observed in the metallic pyrochlore.@xcite     has the same projection as layer @xmath8 ) . ]    here , we connect these research directions and consider a tight - binding model describing spin - orbit coupled electrons on a quasi - two - dimensional slab of pyrochlore including @xmath1 parallel kagome layers and @xmath2 intermediate triangular layers ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> _ setup . </S>",
    "<S> _ our starting point is the following highly idealized model describing rashba spin - orbit coupled electrons on pyrochlore slabs including @xmath1 kagome layers , @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 creates an electron with spin @xmath13 at site @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a vector containing the pauli matrices as its elements . in </S>",
    "<S> the following we consider hopping , @xmath16 , between ( next ) nearest neighbors within each kagome plane with amplitude @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) as well as nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath19 , when involving the triangular layers [ cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we consider only electrons whose spin is aligned in the @xmath20 direction and consider the electric field @xmath21 originating from ions at the center of each hexagon in the kagome layer , @xmath22 , to effect only the hopping along the ( directed ) bonds , @xmath23 , within @xmath22 , such that @xmath24 parametrizes the nearest and next - nearest spin - orbit hopping strengths @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for a single layer , @xmath27 , our model ( [ ham ] ) reduces to the kagome model introduced in ref . .    </S>",
    "<S> in reciprocal space ( [ ham ] ) is represented by a @xmath28 hermitian matrix , @xmath29 , which is diagonalized , @xmath30 , by the states @xmath31 , where @xmath32 labels the states in the unit cell , @xmath33 labels the bands in order of increasing energies , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> for an explicit construction of @xmath29 we refer to the supplemental material . to characterize the bands with dispersion @xmath36 we calculate the chern number , @xmath37 , which is a topologically protected integer quantity defined for an isolated band described by the wave functions @xmath38 , via the berry curvature , @xmath39 , which in turn is defined in terms of the berry connection @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical significance of the chern number is that it counts the number of current carrying edge states , and as such gives the quantized hall conductivity of a filled band , @xmath41 @xcite ( and typically @xmath42 for an incompressible state at fractional band filling , @xmath43 ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> band structure and wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> _ we begin our discussion of the band structure of ( [ ham ] ) by considering a few instructive limiting cases . </S>",
    "<S> first , for @xmath44 , there are @xmath45 perfectly flat bands which can be understood from counting the number of linearly independent localized modes  for @xmath27 these can be taken as localized on each hexagon with amplitudes of alternating sign . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the three - dimensional limit , @xmath46 , this is consistent with the two flat 3d bands known from bulk pyrochlore @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> these perfectly flat bands are , however , not carrying a well - defined chern number as dispersive bands touch the flat ones at quadratic touching points occurring at @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> next , for @xmath48 and finite spin - orbit coupling , @xmath49 , we get @xmath1 decoupled copies of the band structure , including @xmath50 bands , discovered in ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( in addition there are @xmath2 trivial bands due to the inert triangular layers ) .    turning to the full spin - orbit </S>",
    "<S> coupled model with @xmath51 , we quite generically find a band with chern number @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : bands ] provides examples of the band structure , including flat bands with @xmath3 ( in this example situated at @xmath52 ) for various @xmath1 given a suitable choice of hopping parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 bands have identical ( weak ) dispersion , @xmath53 , regardless of the number of kagome layers , @xmath1 , as will become clear later when we consider the properties of the wave functions .    to quantify </S>",
    "<S> how well the nontrivial bands are separated from the other bands we define the flatness ratio , @xmath54 , in terms of the bandwidth , @xmath55 $ ] , and the energy gap , @xmath56 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a negative flatness ratio does not imply the existence of touching points , but it signals that there is no chemical potential such that only the topological band is partly filled ( at the noninteracting level ) . while the topological band itself is independent of the value of @xmath19 as long as it is nonzero </S>",
    "<S> , the other bands depend in general on the detailed value of @xmath19 , leading to a nontrivial @xmath19-dependence of @xmath54 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tperp](a ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tperp](b ) we fix @xmath57 and plot @xmath54 as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this further illustrates the fact that although reaching optimal values is a matter of fine - tuning , there are sizable parameter regions for which @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of energy scales demonstrated in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bands],[fig : tperp ] implies that there is a region of parameter space up to relatively large @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 , for some interaction strength , @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> note however , that one can in principle always make the bandwidth , @xmath62 , arbitrarily small by including longer range hopping @xcite , thus the limit on @xmath1 is not a fundamental one , but rather an estimate on what might be achieved for reasonable fine - tuning . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , adding a chemical potential on the triangular layers , @xmath63 , provides additional freedom of shifting the other bands while leaving the flat @xmath3 band completely unaltered.@xcite as in the @xmath0 bands studied earlier , this clearly provides a promising platform for strongly correlated states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath64 bands could lead to new phenomena with no analog in continuum systems ( landau levels ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a prominent feature of the wave functions in the flat topological bands is that they are entirely localized to the kagome layers . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find that the wave functions in the @xmath3 bands can be completely understood in terms of the states @xmath65 in the nearly flat band with chern number @xmath0 in the single - layer kagome model.@xcite more specifically , the @xmath3 states can be written as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the @xmath0 state localized to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath68 are uniquely determined by local constraints similar to those in localized modes appearing in frustrated hopping models without spin - orbit interactions ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> , e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> ): the relevant amplitudes in the kagome layers obey a sum rule leading to a vanishing total amplitude for hopping to the triangular layers . in terms of the wave function amplitudes , </S>",
    "<S> this can be stated as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 depends on the unit cell and gauge conventions.@xcite in terms of @xmath68 , this requirement leads to a nontrivial probability distribution , @xmath71 , of being in kagome layer @xmath22 , as is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prob ] and derived in the supplemental material .    that the wave functions are completely localized to the kagome layers </S>",
    "<S> is indeed reminiscent of the structure of multi - layer quantum hall systems , or any system including @xmath1 decoupled @xmath0 bands for that matter . </S>",
    "<S> however , the structure of the hilbert spaces is starkly different  while the interlayer dynamics in more conventional multilayer systems can in principle be independent , i.e. , the layers are coupled only via interactions , the particle motion within different kagome layers in the @xmath3 bands is necessarily strongly coupled even in the absence of interactions between the layers . </S>",
    "<S> a manifestation of this coupling between layers is that translations in reciprocal space within the @xmath3 bands effectively amount to shifting the kagome layer . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , it was argued that bands with this type of symmetry enriched translation structure can , in principle , harbor entirely new phenomena such as wormholes with non - abelian statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> the nontrivial translation structure is especially transparent in the @xmath72 case highlighted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prob](a ) : at the @xmath73-point the full weight of the wave function is in the lower layer , @xmath74 , while it is entirely localized to the upper layer at @xmath75 , @xmath76 , i.e. , at the @xmath77-point . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the role of the kagome layers @xmath22 and @xmath78 are interchanged by the transformation @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath80 the total weight is not evenly distributed over all kagome layers ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prob ] ( b)-(d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , as a function of @xmath81 , the probability of being in a certain layer reaches unity only in the top ( @xmath82 ) and bottom ( @xmath83 ) layers as a direct consequence of @xmath71 . for large @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a considerable fraction of the integrated weight , @xmath84 , is carried by the outermost layers , i.e. , by the surface as is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prob](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this surface localization is also in sharp contrast to more conventional multilayer systems .    _ discussion . </S>",
    "<S> _ in this work , we have demonstrated that nearly flat bands with chern number @xmath3 exist in a short - range tight - binding model on a quasi - two - dimensional slab of the pyrochlore lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we have also provided a detailed characterization of the wave functions within these bands and highlighted their structure , which is qualitatively distinct from systems hosting multiple @xmath0 bands such as multilayer quantum hall systems . at partial band filling it is very likely that this model harbors intriguing correlated states . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , based on an elegant , albeit rather implicit , wannier function approach @xcite , it was recently argued@xcite that lattice dislocations can lead to qualitatively new phenomena that are only realizable in @xmath85 bands . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have provided a promising platform for realizing such phenomena and a testbed for future numerical studies of flat bands with variable chern number .    </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing open question is whether our model , _ mutatis mutandis _ , can be realized experimentally . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed promising that there is a rapid development in engineering quasi - two - dimensional ( multi - layer ) oxides@xcite , and in particular , that there exists a number of pyrochlore - based transition - metal oxide materials , especially iridates , where the conduction electrons experience strong spin - orbit effects.@xcite    it has recently been shown that our model indeed harbors a large number of new fractional chern insulator phases.@xcite    we acknowledge useful discussions with p. brouwer , a. luchli and z. liu . </S>",
