    "close pairs of white dwarfs with combined masses greater than the chandrasekhar limit have long been discussed as potential progenitors of type  ia supernovae @xcite . however , despite searches , @xcite no secure examples of double white dwarfs both massive enough and short - period enough to merge within a hubble time have been found . only about 1 in a 1000 white dwarfs",
    "are required to be in such systems to match type  ia rates @xcite .",
    "since only of order 1000 white dwarfs have been searched for binarity to date , the deficit is not yet significant , however it continues to be worth searching for more such systems . in an effort to do",
    "so we examined the spectra of da white dwarfs ( those showing spectra with hydrogen absorption only ) from the sdss survey @xcite , looking for objects of discrepant radial velocity .",
    "one star , sdssj1257 + 5428  was an obvious outlier with a mean radial velocity of @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we present follow - up spectroscopy to elucidate the nature of this object .",
    "sdssj1257 + 5428  was the subject of a similar study by @xcite .",
    "they found that it was a binary , measured a radial velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath12 on a period of @xmath0hours and fitted their spectra with a white dwarf of temperature @xmath13k and high mass , @xmath14 .",
    "the period , radial velocity amplitude and white dwarf mass give a minimum mass for the companion of @xmath15 , suggesting that it is either a neutron star or black - hole . @xcite estimated a distance of @xmath16pc for sdssj1257 + 5428 , implying that such systems may be rather common .",
    "@xcite recognised that their spectral fits were problematic , and in particular failed to fit the narrow cores of the balmer lines .",
    "thus while they favored a neutron star or a black - hole for the companion , they could not entirely eliminate the possibility that it was another white dwarf .",
    "@xcite took three high signal - to - noise spectra which showed asymmetries suggesting exactly this ; they showed that their spectra could be fit by a combination of a cool , low mass white dwarf ( @xmath17k , @xmath18 ) plus a hotter , massive white dwarf companion ( @xmath19,@xmath20k , @xmath21 ) .",
    "@xcite s paper appeared shortly after the original submission of our work .",
    "although both our papers agreed upon the basic double white dwarf nature of sdssj1257 + 5428 , there were significant differences of detail , with inconsistencies in both masses and temperatures . in an effort to understand these , we have since carried out additional fits to our data , which we present here along with our original approach .",
    "in addition , an improved _ swift _ calibration has given us more confidence in the modelling of the uv - optical spectral energy distribution .",
    "our new results agree more closely with @xcite than our original analysis , but also reveal uncertainties in the system properties which make it impossible to establish securely such fundamental properties as whether the system is super - chandrasekhar or not .",
    "we begin with a description of our observational material .",
    "we obtained 140 spectra in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands covering the balmer series on the william herschel telescope in la palma using the isis double - beam spectrograph .",
    "the first 22 spectra were taken in service mode on the night of april 20 , 2008 , while the final 118 were acquired during a four night run spanning april 29 to may 2 , 2009 .",
    "the data were debiassed , flat - fielded and optimally extracted @xcite . the wavelength scale for each spectrum",
    "was linearly interpolated in time from pairs of bracketing arc calibration spectra . in 2008 ,",
    "the night was clear with seeing @xmath24 to @xmath25 arcsec , however the moon was full . in 2009 ,",
    "the moon was only 40% illuminated , but conditions were poorer , and we lost a total of one night to clouds while the seeing varied from @xmath26 to @xmath27 arcsec .",
    "in addition to the optical spectroscopy , we obtained ultraviolet flux measurements of sdssj1257 + 5428  with the _ swift _ satellite and accessed additional archival data from 7 epochs of observations covering the interval aug 24 2009  jan 13 2010 .",
    "our summed images had effective exposure times ranging from 818 to 5608s .",
    "sdssj1257 + 5428  was well detected in all four uv filters provided by _",
    "swift_/uvot @xcite .",

    "associated zero - point calibration files and filter effective area curves ( jan 2011 release ) were used to calculate the fluxes for each filter .",
    "in all that follows we will refer to the component most obvious in the spectra as the primary star , and its companion as the secondary star .",

    "[ fig : logg_teff ] shows , if the mass of the primary is below this limit , then in order to keep the cooling age of the primary short enough to allow the secondary to be as hot as it is , the gravity must lie at the lower end of the range with @xmath108 .",

    "the independent evidence provided by the uv - optical sed favors a high temperature for the secondary as found by @xcite , suggesting that their data are less affected by continuum problems than ours , although their low gravity for the primary possibly indicates that they are not entirely immune to the same problems .",

    "however , the absence of a narrow core in h@xmath7 of the secondary white dwarf in sdssj1257 + 5428  is suggestive of rapid rotation with @xmath132 , which throws doubt upon this assumption since we estimate from consideration of the moment of inertia of the white dwarf and the angular momentum of the accreted material that it should have accreted @xmath133 to attain this rotation rate .",
    "this would require a much more prolonged period of accretion than allowed by a common envelope , given a maximum accretion rate onto a white dwarf of a few @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of evolutionary scenarios involving stable second phases of mass transfer discussed by @xcite .",
    "a possible near - relative of sdssj1257 + 5428  is the star hd  49798 in which a massive , rapidly spinning white dwarf orbits an sdo star @xcite .",
    "uncertainty remains however over the cause of the broad profiles .",
    "there is no sign of zeeman splitting in h@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dtangle_r ] ) , but as @xcite suggest , a magnetic field could make the core more difficult to see , and , if suitably distributed in strength across the surface , would not necessarily lead to obvious splitting . in a dual rotation - plus - magnetic - field model , the field could also act to increase the lever arm for accretion and hence reduce the amount of material needed to spin the white dwarf up . alternatively ,",
    "if the atmosphere is helium - dominated , we will see deeper into the star which may allow stark broadening to wipe out the h@xmath7 core . finally , the temperature of the secondary star is such that it could lie within the zz  ceti pulsational instability strip .",
    "it is observed @xcite that zz  ceti stars show weak cores in h@xmath7 , probably the result of motion in their photospheres @xcite .",
    "it would be worth observing sdssj1257 + 5428  photometrically for pulsations .",
    "close pairs of white dwarfs are common within our galaxy , and their future evolution has been the subject of much discussion , not least as potential progenitors of type  ia supernovae . for sdssj1257 + 5428 ,",
    "the first step is clear : gravitational radiation will reduce the orbital period to the point at which mass transfer starts .",
    "the orbital period at this point will be about @xmath135minutes which will be reached in @xmath136years .",
    "the outcome of mass transfer is uncertain and our constraints allow any of three possibilities which are ( i ) explosion as a type  ia supernova , ( ii ) accretion - induced collapse to a millisecond pulsar and ( iii ) survival of the onset of mass transfer as a hydrogen - deficient ultra - compact binary .",
    "we slightly favor the third possibility on the grounds that the mass ratio @xmath137 is extreme enough to allow stable mass transfer @xcite , while we suspect the total mass to be less than the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "sdssj1257 + 5428  is therefore likely to become a semi - detached , accreting double white dwarf ( am  cvn star ) .",
    "the secondary star will become the accretor . since it is massive for a white dwarf , and",
    "as long as it is not an one white dwarf , the system is a good candidate progenitor of the sub - luminous `` .ia '' supernovae discussed by @xcite and possibly observed by @xcite .",
    "we find that the putative white dwarf  black - hole / neutron star binary , sdssj1257 + 5428 , is a double white dwarf . sdssj1257 + 5428",
    "is composed of a very low mass @xmath138 white dwarf together with an extremely massive ( @xmath139 ) white dwarf . as long as the massive white dwarf avoids accretion - induced collapse or explosion , sdssj1257",
    "+ 5428  will evolve into a hydrogen - deficient accreting binary star , but may later explode as a sub - luminous type  ia .",
    "the massive white dwarf shows signs of rapid rotation ( @xmath140 ) which suggests that the most recent phase of mass transfer might not have involved a common envelope , contrary to current models of double white dwarf populations .",
    "some inconsistencies in the parameters of the two white dwarfs remain that are probably caused by difficulties in fitting their blended spectra ; further observations are required to clarify these .                    , d.  j. , liebert , j. , harris , h.  c. , kleinman , s.  j. , nitta , a. , silvestri , n. , anderson , s.  a. , barentine , j.  c. , brewington , h.  j. , brinkmann , j. , harvanek , m. , krzesiski , j. , neilsen , jr . , e.  h. , long , d. , schneider , d.  p. , & snedden , s.  a. 2006 , , 167 , 40              , m.  m. , kulkarni , s.  r. , gal - yam , a. , yaron , o. , quimby , r.  m. , ofek , e.  o. , nugent , p. , poznanski , d. , jacobsen , j. , sternberg , a. , arcavi , i. , howell , d.  a. , sullivan , m. , rich , d.  j. , burke , p.  f. , brimacombe , j. , milisavljevic , d. , fesen , r. , bildsten , l. , shen , k. , cenko , s.  b. , bloom , j.  s. , hsiao , e. , law , n.  m. , gehrels , n. , immler , s. , dekany , r. , rahmer , g. , hale , d. , smith , r. , zolkower , j. , velur , v. , walters , r. , henning , j. , bui , k. , & mckenna , d. 2010 , , 723 , l98                          , r. , drechsel , h. , heber , u. , karl , c. , pauli , e .-",
