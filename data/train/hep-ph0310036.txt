    "the search for the higgs boson to explore the mechanism of symmetry breaking is one of the most important tasks of the experimental program at the future colliders .",
    "while it can only be produced in association with another particle at an @xmath4 collider , the higgs boson can be produced singly in the s - channel of the colliding photons at a photon collider .",
    "if the mass of the higgs boson is light , as indicated by the current electroweak measurements , then it will be found by the time a @xmath0 collider is constructed .",
    "the aim of such collider will be then a precise measurement of higgs properties . among these",
    "the measurement of the two photon decay width of the higgs boson is particularly important .",
    "the higgs boson can be produced in @xmath5 collisions via a one - loop diagram , in which all charged particles whose masses derive from the higgs mechanism can appear inside the loop . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the dominant contributions come from the top and w boson loops .",
    "a deviation of the two photon width from the sm prediction indicates additional contribution from unknown particles , and is a signature of physics beyond the sm .",
    "for example , the minimal extension of the sm predicts the ratio of the two photon width @xmath6/ @xmath7 1.2 @xcite for a higgs boson with a mass of 120 gev , assuming a supersymmetry scale of 1 tev and the chargino mass parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 of 300 and 100 gev , respectively .    at a @xmath0 collider ,",
    "the two photon decay width is obtained by measuring the higgs formation cross section in the reaction @xmath10 , where x is the detected final state .",
    "the number of detected events is proportional to the product @xmath11@xmath12br@xmath13 .",
    "measuring the formation cross section will determine this product .",
    "an independent measurement of the branching ratio br(@xmath14 ) at @xmath4 collider allows a determination of the @xmath0 partial width .    in this paper",
    "we study the accuracy of the measurement of the two photon decay width for a higgs boson with the mass of 120 gev .",
    "the study is performed for the photon collider option of the tesla linear collider operated at centre - of - mass energy of 210 gev .",
    "the assumed data volume corresponds to a total @xmath0 integrated luminosity of 400 fb@xmath1 @xcite , which amounts to about @xmath15 = 80 fb@xmath1 in the hard part of the spectrum .",
    "the feasibility of the measurement of the two photon decay width of the higgs boson in this mass region has also been reported by @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the higgs boson formation is given by a breit - wigner approximation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the higgs boson mass , @xmath11 and @xmath18 are the two photon and total decay width of the higgs boson , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the initial photon helicities and @xmath21 is the @xmath0 centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the initial photons should have equal helicities , so that @xmath22 = 0 , in order to make a spin-0 resonance as it is the case of the higgs boson .",
    "if polarised photon beams are used , the signal cross section is increased up to a factor of 2 .",
    "the experimentally observed cross section is obtained by folding this basic cross section with the @xmath0 collider luminosity distribution .",
    "a higgs boson with the mass of 120 gev is detected in the @xmath23 final state .",
    "the event rate is given by the formula : @xmath24 where the conversion factor @xmath25 is 3.8937966@xmath26@xmath27 fb gev@xmath28 .",
    "it depends strongly on the differential luminosity , @xmath29 .",
    "the shape of the luminosity distribution depends on the electron and laser beam parameters .",
    "the electron and laser beam energy considered for this study are 105 gev and 1 ev , respectively , resulting in the maximum photon energy of about 75 gev , suitable to study a higgs boson with the mass of 120 gev .",
    "the combination of the polarisation of the laser and the electron are chosen such to make the generated photon spectrum peak at its maximum energy .",
    "the helicity combination of the two high energy photons is arranged such that @xmath22 = 0 state is dominant .",
    "the luminosity distributions for the @xmath22=0 and @xmath30 = 2 are provided by the circe2 @xcite program and shown in figure [ fig_lumi ] .",
    "beamstrahlung , secondary collisions between electrons and laser beam photons , and other non - linear effects are taken into account when calculating the @xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath29 is 1.6 fb@xmath1/gev .    the branching ratios br(h @xmath31 ) , br(h @xmath32 ) and the total width are taken to be 0.22@xmath3 , 68@xmath3 and 4 mev , respectively , and are calculated with the hdecay @xcite program including qcd radiative corrections .",
    "a signal rate of about 20000 events per year can be achieved under these conditions .",
    "the main background processes are the direct continuum @xmath33 and @xmath34 production . due to helicity conservation",
    ", the continuum background production proceeds mainly through the states of opposite photon helicities , making the states @xmath35 .",
    "choosing equal helicity photon polarisations the cross section of the continuum background is suppressed by a factor @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the quark mass .",
    "unfortunately , this suppression does not apply to the process @xmath38 , because after the gluon radiation the @xmath39 system is not necessarily in a @xmath40 state .",
    "the surviving background is large and overwhelms the signal .",
    "the signal @xmath41 process , as well as the background @xmath42(g ) events are generated with the pythia @xcite program .",
    "parton evolution and hadronization are simulated using the parton shower and the string fragmentation models .",
    "a convolution with the luminosity distribution is performed , and kinematic cuts of @xmath43 and @xmath21 greater than 80 gev are imposed during the event generation , @xmath44 denoting the polar angle of the produced quarks .",
    "the qcd corrections to @xmath42 have to be taken into account for a reliable background estimation .",
    "for this purpose we use the total cross sections shown in figure [ fig_cs ] , which include the soft and hard gluon emission @xcite , virtual corrections @xcite and non - sudakov form factors @xcite to weight the event .",
    "the event topology is given by the parton shower model .",
    "the effective cross sections , the number of expected and generated signal and background events are presented in table [ tab_cs ] .    to simulate the response of the apparatus we use simdet @xcite , a fast monte carlo program which smears the kinematics of the particles in the final state according to the detector resolutions .",
    "the detector used in the simulation follows the proposal presented in the technical design report of the tesla @xmath45 linear collider @xcite .",
    "however , the changes in the detector design for @xmath0 collisions will affect only the forward region @xcite which is not important for this analysis .",
    "the analysis aims to select events with two or three multiplicity jets from the higgs boson decay .",
    "two of these jets contain bottom quarks .",
    "the invariant mass of the jets has to be consistent with the higgs mass .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the durham clustering scheme @xcite with the parameter y@xmath46=0.02 .",
    "we select events with a visible energy larger than 95 gev and the energy imbalance longitudinal to the beam direction below 10@xmath3 of the visible energy .",
    "figures [ fig_costh]a , b shows the distribution of the cosine of the thrust angle for the signal and background events .",
    "the s - channel signal process has an isotropic angular distribution , while the t - channel background processes are forward peaked .",
    "we require the absolute value of this quantity to be below 0.7 .",
    "the cross section for the continuum production of the charm quark is 16 times larger than for bottom quarks , therefore b - quark tagging is crucial in this analysis .",
    "the b - tagging algorithm relies on a neural network with 12 inputs and 3 output nodes , described in ref .",
    "the most important inputs comprise the impact parameter joint probability tag introduced by aleph @xcite , the @xmath47 corrected vertex invariant mass obtained with the zvtop algorithm written for the sld experiment @xcite and a one - prong charm tag using the largest and second largest track impact parameter significances in @xmath48 - @xmath49 and @xmath48 - @xmath50 , in jets where zvtop found only the primary vertex . the spectrum of the neural network output @xmath51 to discriminate b - quark jets from u- , d- , s- and c - quark jets is presented in figure [ fig_btag]a .",
    "the performance of the neural network b - tag in z@xmath52 decays is shown in figure [ fig_btag]b .",
    "we require at least 2 vertices to be found and ask that the @xmath51 to be greater than 0.95 .",
    "the b - tagging efficiency is 70@xmath3 and corresponds to a purity of 98@xmath3 .",
    "the efficiency of this selection is found to be 36@xmath3 .",
    "a background not discussed yet is the process @xmath54hadrons , where photons interact hadronically at the interaction point . with a total hadronic cross section in @xmath0 collisions of 400 nb",
    ", we estimate about 1.4 such events per bunch crossing .",
    "these events obscure the interesting physics processes described in the previous sections . for this reason this class of events needs to be included in the pythia simulation for overlap .",
    "the hades @xcite program is used for this purpose .",
    "a large fraction of this background is distributed at small angles and we believe that it can be reduced cutting on the polar angle of the tracks @xcite .",
    "a careful study of this hadronic background is currently being performed .",
    "the reconstructed invariant mass for the selected signal and background events is shown in figure [ fig_mass ] . to enhance the signal a cut on the invariant mass",
    "is tuned such that the statistical significance of the signal over background is maximised .",
    "events in the mass region of 106 gev @xmath55 126 gev are selected .",
    "the number of estimated signal and background events in this window are 6018 and 7111 , respectively .",
    "the two photon decay width of the higgs boson is proportional to the event rates of the higgs signal .",
    "the statistical error of the number of signal events , @xmath56 , corresponds to the statistical error of this measurement .",
    "here @xmath57 is the number of observed events , while @xmath58 is the number of expected background events .",
    "we obtain @xmath59}{[\\gamma ( \\rm h \\to \\gamma \\gamma ) \\times \\rm br ( \\rm h \\to \\rm b \\bar{\\rm b})]}=\\sqrt n_{\\rm obs}/({\\it n } _ { \\rm obs}-{\\it n}_{\\rm bkg})=1.9\\% .\\ ] ] we can improve this number by 0.1@xmath3 doing a fit with the function @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the fraction of signal events , @xmath62 and @xmath63 the background and observed number of events in each bin of the invariant mass distributins and @xmath64 a fit parameter .    we conclude that for a higgs boson with a mass @xmath17=120 gev we can measure the product @xmath2 with an accuracy of 1.8@xmath3 using an integrated luminosity corresponding to one year of data taking at the tesla photon collider .",
