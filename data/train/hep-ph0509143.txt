    "the @xmath5 meson was first observed in cdf@xcite detector at the fermilab tevatron in 1.8 tev @xmath6 collisions .",
    "it was measured to have a mass @xmath7 and lifetime @xmath8 , which agree with the theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "its mass and the spectrum of the binding system can be computed by potential model@xcite , pnrqcd@xcite and lattice qcd@xcite etc .",
    "the results are in the region , @xmath9gev .",
    "its lifetime was estimated in terms of the effective theory of weak interaction and by applying the effective lagrangian to the inclusive processes of @xmath5 decays@xcite . according to the estimates , the lifetime is @xmath10ps , a typical one for weak interaction via virtual @xmath11 boson .",
    "further detailed experimental studies can be performed at b factories ( kek , slac ) and cern large hadron collider(lhc ) .",
    "especially , at lhc with the luminosity @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the number of @xmath14 events is expected to be about @xmath15 per year @xcite , so there seems to exist a real possibility to study not only some @xmath5 rare decays , but also cp violation , t violation and polarization asymmetries .",
    "the studies of cp violation , t violation and polarization asymmetries are specially interesting since they can serve as good tools to test the predictions of sm or to reveal the new physics effects beyond the sm .",
    "the study of @xmath5 meson , the ground state of the heavy - flavored binding system @xmath16 , the bottom and the charm , constitute a very rich laboratory since this meson is also a suitable object for studying the predictions of qcd .",
    "as @xmath5 meson has many decay channels because of its sufficiently large mass predictions of qcd are more reliable .",
    "the @xmath5 meson decays provide windows for reliable determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath17 and can shed light on new physics beyond the standard model .    in the framework of the sm",
    "its decays can occur via three mechanisms : ( 1 ) the c - quark decay with the b - quark being a spectator , ( 2 ) the b - quark decay with the c - quark being a spectator , ( 3 ) b - quark and c - quark annihilation .",
    "the first two mechanisms are expected to contribute about @xmath18 of the total width , and the remaining @xmath19 is owed to the annihilation process .",
    "there is another decay mode which does not belong to the three aforementioned types , and it can only occur via the ozi processes .",
    "as we know that the ozi rule@xcite plays an important role in the processes which occur via strong interaction and in general at the parton level the concerned calculations are carried out in the framework of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the first investigation of the ozi - forbidden annihilation decays in qcd was carried out in 1999 @xcite . in their work , an effective lagrangian was adopted to avoid introducing the @xmath20 meson wave function , meanwhile they dealt with the light meson by using an effective @xmath21 coupling @xcite@xcite , which was obtained in the nrqm approximation .",
    "the valence quark @xmath22 and anti - quark @xmath23 in the light meson were assumed to possess equal momenta and be on their mass shells , i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the branching ratio estimated to be @xmath26 for @xmath27 , which is accessible at cern lhc .    in this paper , we investigate lepton polarization asymmetries in semileptonic annihilation decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give the details of the calculation of the amplitude and polarization asymmetries .",
    "section 3 is devoted to numerical results and discussions .",
    "the effective lagrangian responsible for @xmath28 decay is @xcite ( b|c g^*_a g^*_b l^- ) = v_cbg_s^2 tr[t_a t_b ] |v_c ( p_c ) u_b(p_b ) + ^(1-_5)_l + ( , k_1k_2 ) . using the dirac equation and identity for dirac matrices ,",
