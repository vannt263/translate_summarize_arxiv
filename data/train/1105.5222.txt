    "the determination of the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter ( nm ) has been the main object of numerous nuclear structure and reaction studies involving unstable nuclei lying close to the neutron or proton driplines @xcite .",
    "the knowledge about the eos of asymmetric nm is vital for any model of neutron star @xcite , and the nuclear mean - field potential is the most important input for the determination of the nuclear eos .",
    "many microscopic studies of the eos have been done based on the nuclear mean field given by both nonrelativistic and relativistic nuclear many - body approaches , using realistic two - body and three - body nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces or interaction lagrangians ( see recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "these many - body studies have shown the important role played by the pauli blocking effects as well as higher - order nn correlations at different nm densities .",
    "these medium effects are normally considered as the physics origin of the density dependence that has been introduced into various versions of the effective nn interactions used in the modern mean - field approaches . among them , very popular is the so - called m3y interaction which was originally constructed to reproduce the g - matrix elements of the reid @xcite and paris @xcite nn potentials in an oscillator basis .",
    "several realistic density dependences have been added later on to the m3y interactions @xcite to properly account for the nm saturation properties as well as the ground - state structure of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "these density dependent versions of the m3y interaction have been used in the nonrelativistic hartree - fock ( hf ) studies of symmetric and asymmetric nm .",
    "some of them have been successfully used in the folding model studies of the nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus scattering @xcite .    in attempt to find a realistic version of the effective nn interaction for consistent use in the mean - field studies of nm and finite nuclei as well as in the nuclear reaction calculations ,",
    "we have performed recently a systematic hf study of nm @xcite using the cdm3y@xmath2 interactions , which have been used mainly in the folding model studies of the nuclear scattering @xcite , and the m3y - p@xmath2 interactions carefully parametrized by nakada @xcite for use in the hf studies of nuclear structure . for comparison ,",
    "the same hf study has also been done with the d1s and d1n versions of the gogny interaction @xcite and sly4 version of the skyrme interaction @xcite .",
    "while these effective nn interactions give more or less the same description of the saturation properties of the symmetric nm , the hf results for the asymmetric nm @xcite show that they are divided into two families , which are associated with two different ( _ soft _ and _ stiff _ ) behaviors of the nm symmetry energy at high nucleon densities . as a result , these two families predict very different behaviors of the proton - to - neutron ratio in the @xmath1-equilibrium that can imply two drastically different mechanisms for the neutron star cooling ( with or without the direct urca process ) @xcite .    as a further step in this direction",
    ", we try to find out in the present work how such a difference in the nm symmetry energy can affect the eos of the @xmath1-stable neutron star ( ns ) matter as well as the main ns properties like the maximum mass , radius , central density and moment of inertia . for this purpose ,",
    "the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations have been solved using different eos s of the ns matter that are associated with the nuclear mean - field potentials given by different in - medium nn interactions under study . given the complex , inhomogeneous structure of the ns crust , it is a tremendous task to develop a consistent structure model for the inner and outer ns crusts using all versions of the in - medium nn interaction considered here .",
    "therefore , we have used the eos of the ns crust given by the compressible liquid drop model ( cldm ) @xcite with the model parameters determined by the sly4 interaction @xcite .",
    "different eos s of the uniform ns core are then calculated for the np@xmath0 composition in the @xmath1-equilibrium at zero temperature and extended to the supranuclear densities , using the mean - field potentials given by different density - dependent nn interactions . in this way ,",
    "any difference found in the solutions of the tov equations is entirely due to the choice of the eos of the ns core , i.e. , to the choice of the in - medium nn interaction .",
    "the main ns properties obtained in each case are compared with the empirical data given by the recent astronomical observation of neutron stars .",

    "the knowledge about the density dependence of @xmath19 is extremely important for the construction of nuclear eos and it has been , therefore , a longstanding goal of many nuclear structure and reaction studies . the main method to probe @xmath19 associated with a given in - medium nn interaction is to test this interaction in the simulation of heavy - ion ( hi ) collisions using transport and/or statistical models @xcite or in the structure studies of nuclei with large neutron excess @xcite . based on the physics constraints implied by such studies , extrapolation is often made to draw conclusion on the low- and high - density behavior of @xmath19 .",

    "<S> the nuclear mean - field potentials obtained in the hartree - fock method with different choices of the in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction have been used to study the equation of state ( eos ) of the neutron star ( ns ) matter . </S>",
    "<S> the eos of the uniform ns core has been calculated for the np@xmath0 composition in the @xmath1-equilibrium at zero temperature , using version sly4 of the skyrme interaction as well as two density - dependent versions of the finite - range m3y interaction ( cdm3y@xmath2 and m3y - p@xmath2 ) , and versions d1s and d1n of the gogny interaction . </S>",
    "<S> although the considered effective nn interactions were proven to be quite realistic in numerous nuclear structure and/or reaction studies , they give quite different behaviors of the symmetry energy of nuclear matter at supranuclear densities that lead to the _ soft _ and _ stiff _ scenarios discussed recently in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> different eos s of the ns core and the eos of the ns crust given by the compressible liquid drop model have been used as input of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations to study how the nuclear symmetry energy affects the model prediction of different ns properties , like the cooling process as well as the gravitational mass , radius , and moment of inertia . </S>"
