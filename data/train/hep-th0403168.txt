    "the possibility of rg limit cycles has received little attention until recently , partly because of the scarcity of compelling examples .",

    ", there is an accumulation of 3-body bound states near threshold with binding energies differing by multiplicative factors of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , which is called the efimov effect , can be understood in terms of a renormalization group limit cycle with discrete scaling factor @xmath7 .",
    "this application has been made more compelling by bedaque , hammer , and van kolck , who reformulated the problem using effective field theory @xcite .",
    "other examples of renormalization group limit cycles have recently begun to emerge .",
    "there are discrete hamiltonian systems that exhibit rg limit cycles in appropriate continuum limits @xcite .",

    "this geometric spectrum reflects an asymptotic discrete scaling symmetry in which the distance from the origin is rescaled by the discrete scaling factor @xmath23 .",
