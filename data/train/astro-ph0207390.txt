    "the possibility that some of the `` fundamental constants '' may depend on time was first discussed by dirac @xcite .",
    "he remarked that the huge ratio of electric to gravitational forces between a proton and an electron , about @xmath2 , was of the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe in units provided by the atomic constants , @xmath3 .",
    "if this coincidence is not casual , then one must have varying constants , their values changing as the age of the universe changes : _",
    "`` this suggests that the above mentioned large numbers are to be regarded not as constants , but as simple functions of our present epoch , expressed in atomic units .... in this way we avoid the need of a theory to determine numbers of the order @xmath2 . ''",
    "_ the approach of dirac to what is now called the hierarchy problem opened a rich field of investigation .",
    "the variability of fundamental constants was analysed by gamow , dyson and others and then it was forgotten for a while .",
    "interest in this topic has been revived in the context of string theories , where all the coupling constants and parameters , except the string tension , are actually derived quantities , which are determined by the vacuum expectation values of the dilaton and moduli .",
    "since all these fields evolve on cosmological scales the time variation of the constants of nature during the evolution of the universe arises as a natural possibility , see e.g. @xcite .    on the observational side , webb et al .",

    "essentially one needs to identify two ( sets of ) lines , which depend differently on @xmath0 , so as to extract the value of the redshift factor @xmath5 together with the value of @xmath0 at that epoch .",

    "this was first pointed out in @xcite and then discussed with much greater detail in @xcite .",
    "the oklo bound arises , essentially , from the fact that the q value of a nuclear reaction contains an electromagnetic contribution which is sensitive to changes of @xmath0 .",
    "the constancy of q , within a small scale of order @xmath57 , follows from the observation that reaction rates are the same , now and at the oklo time .",
    "conceptually , one is again comparing two ( nuclear ) clocks operating at different times .",
    "a similar argument can be applied to radioactive dating methods .",
    "the point is that the lifetimes @xmath58 of radioactive nuclei depend on the q - value of the decay .",

    "the agreement within errors ( again apart for accidental cancellations ) provides a significant constraint , @xmath63 , where the bar denotes an average over the meteorite lifetime .",
    "it is not as strong as the oklo bound , however it explores earlier times .",
    "furthermore , two independent constraints ( oklo and meteorites ) are important if one consider the possibility of simultaneous variations of several fundamental parameters",
    ".    cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) yields information on the variability of @xmath0 at even earlier times , since decoupling between radiation and matter occurs at the recombination epoch , the time when temperature is so low that atoms can be stable .",
    "this clearly depends on the atomic binding energy and thus on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a change of @xmath0 also affects the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) mainly through the neutron - proton mass difference , which fixes the neutron density at the weak interactions freeze - out and consequently the primordial @xmath64 abundance . according to most recent analysis , both cmb and bbn are consistent with a a constant @xmath0 and constrain @xmath11 to the per cent level , at @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively @xcite .    for comparing the different information one has to make assumptions about the time evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest hypothesis is a linear time dependence , which is used in the fifth column of table [ tabalfa ] . in this case",
    "the qso positive result only conflicts with the oklo bound , which provides the most strict constraint .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the meteorites give a bound close to the qso signal .",
    "improvements in the laboratory measurements of the @xmath1 lifetime would thus be relevant .",
    "the planned atomic physics experiment on the iss should be capable of exploring the region suggested by qso .",
    "let us remark that the qso - oklo apparent conflict can be avoided if linearity does not hold .",
    "in addition @xmath0 could depend on place .",
    "also one has to remind that @xmath0 is not alone ; its evolution has to be accompanied by the evolution of other coupling constants , otherwise unification of interactions at the present epoch is just occasional .",
    "actually , unification requires that a change of @xmath0 is accompanied by a much stronger change in strong interaction parameters , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a change of @xmath0 corresponds to a change of the qcd scale parameter @xmath67 .",
    "this has important consequences , since nucleon and pion masses scale as @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "nuclear radii , which depend on the range of the nuclear force , are thus also sensitive to a change of @xmath70 .    in this situation ,",
    "the analysis becomes much more complex , see e.g. @xcite and a complete discussion has not yet been performed . generally , one can remark the following points :    -information on the change of @xmath0 give also information on the couplings of other interactions .",

    "the observation of carbon in ancient stars implies that some 10 gyr ago the resonance energy was the same , within @xmath57 .",
    "thus the coulomb contribution to the energy difference levels ( about @xmath91 ) has not changed by more than @xmath57 , which implies @xmath92 . essentially , this is the same argument as for the oklo reactor , however the bound is weaker since @xmath57 is larger .      in the last few years , radioactive",

    "thorium dating of field halo stars and globular cluster stars yields ages on the order of @xmath93 gyr , in agreement with the value derived from globular cluster evolution .",
    "furthermore , recently the age of an old star ( @xmath94 gyr ) has been determined by means of _ both _ th and u dating @xcite so that two clocks are available ! the two methods are in agreement within errors of about 3 gyr , under the assumption that nuclear lifetimes have remained constant . by exploiting the different @xmath0 dependence of the decay rates , ( from @xcite",
    "one derives @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively ) the coherence of results implies that @xmath0 has remained constant to the level @xmath99 on a 12 gyr scale .",
    "there is a substantial cancellation of the @xmath0 varying effect due to the similar @xmath0dependence of the two nuclear clocks .",
