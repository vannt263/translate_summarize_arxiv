    "although the studies on qcd thermodynamics have contributed to the improvement of our understanding of the qcd phase diagram , many challenging questions remain open . in this concern ,",
    "microscopic and phenomenological models have played a meaningful role and are expected to clarify various problems in the future .",
    "phase transitions associated to deconfinement and restoration of chiral and axial u@xmath0(1 ) symmetries are expected to occur at high density and/or temperature . a question that has attracted",
    "a lot of attention is whether these phase transitions take place simultaneously or not and which observables could signal their occurrence .",
    "as it is well known , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model has the drawback of being non renormalizable , its action containing ultraviolet divergences that should be regularized .",
    "different types of regularizations may be found in the literature @xcite , and the sensitivity of different observables to the type of regularization or value of the cutoff has been discussed @xcite . in the njl model ,",
    "the cutoff used to regularize the quark loop term is , in general , lower than 1gev , which limits the domain of applicability of the model .",
    "several unpleasant features of the model are due to the fact that the number of levels of the fermi sea occupied is restricted by the value of the cutoff , as discussed in @xcite , where the authors study the influence of the ultraviolet cutoff on the stability of cold nuclear matter",
    ".    nevertheless , the usefulness of njl - type models to explore a variety of problems is well recognized , and improvements have been achieved , in particular , concerning the regularization procedure .",
    "in fact , while the use of a constant cutoff in all integrals was a standard procedure in the former applications of the model , in the past few years some authors have regularized the action in order to eliminate logarithmic or quadratic divergences only , which means that there is no need to cut the convergent integrals .",
    "this approach has been used in the evaluation of integrals associated to triangle or box diagrams , as in @xcite to calculate the anomalous decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons and in @xcite to calculate the @xmath3 meson form factor and @xmath4 scattering lengths ; in both cases a better agreement with experimental results was obtained .",
    "recently , a regularization method that consists in regularizing , even in the logarithmic and divergent integrals , only the divergent parts has been performed @xcite .",
    "a similar approach is nowadays used at finite temperature , since some integrals , divergent in the vacuum , become convergent due to the presence of the fermi functions ; therefore , the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath5 is used only in the divergent integrals and @xmath6 in the convergent ones .",
    "this procedure was shown to have advantages in the study of several thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "however , the influence of this type of regularization ( which from now on we denote as regularization i ) on a crucial question such as restoration of symmetries has not yet been analyzed .",
    "this is the main goal of the present work .",
    "we perform our calculations in the framework of the three  flavor njl model whose lagrangian includes the determinantal t hooft interaction that breaks the u@xmath0(1 ) symmetry : @xmath7 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & g_d \\bigl [ \\mbox{det}\\bigl [ \\bar{q } ( 1+\\gamma_5 ) q \\bigr ]    +   \\mbox{det}\\bigl [ \\bar{q } ( 1-\\gamma_5 ) q \\bigr]\\bigr ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath8 is the quark field with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the current quark mass matrix , and @xmath12 are the gell ",
    "mann matrices , a = @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the model is fixed by the coupling constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the cutoff parameter @xmath5 , which regularizes the divergent integrals , and the current quark masses @xmath17 .",
    "we use the parameter set @xcite @xmath18 mev , @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 mev , which is fixed by mesonic spectroscopy data : @xmath23 mev , @xmath24 mev , @xmath25 mev , and @xmath26 mev .",
    "the constituent quark masses are fixed in the vacuum by fitting the parameters of the model to physical observables , and , in hot and dense matter , these masses depend on temperature and density / chemical potential .",
    "a drawback of the njl model with the former regularization ( ultraviolet cutoff in all of the integrals  regularization ii ) is that , while , in the chiral limit , the constituent quark masses vanish at a critical temperature ( density ) , away from this limit , the masses , although decreasing , never reach its current values .",
    "this means that chiral symmetry is always only approximately restored , since the quark condensates , the order parameters associated to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , never vanish . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the constituent masses of non strange quarks go asymptotically to their current values , and the condensates become very small at high values of temperature ( density ) , but the strange quark mass is always far from its current value , so it is hard to talk about of restoration of chiral symmetry , even partial , in the strange sector .",
    "therefore , the use of a regularization that leads all of the constituent quark masses to their current values could have important consequences for the restoration of symmetries , especially the axial symmetry that we have shown to be particularly sensitive to the behavior of the strange quark mass @xcite .",
    "the axial u@xmath0(1 ) symmetry is explicitly broken at the quantum level by the axial anomaly that may be described at the semiclassical level by instantons .",
    "this effect is enough to generate a mass for the @xmath27 in the chiral limit , so this meson can not be a remnant of a goldstone boson in the real world .",
    "the u@xmath0(1 ) anomaly is responsible for the flavor mixing effect that lifts the degeneracy between several mesons .",
    "therefore , if there occurs restoration of u@xmath0(1 ) symmetry , the behavior of meson masses and mixing angles should exhibit signals for this restoration .",
    "another observable relevant in this concern is the topological susceptibility @xmath28 and its slope @xcite .",
    "the topological susceptibility is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the topological charge density .",
    "we remark that @xmath28 is related to the @xmath27 mass through the witten - veneziano formula @xcite .",
    "since large instanton effects are supposed to be suppressed at high temperatures or densities , and interactions between instantons contribute to the elimination of fluctuations of the topological charge , there are good reasons to expect that the u@xmath0(1 ) symmetry might be restored @xcite .    several lattice calculations ( see @xcite and references therein ) indicate a sharp decrease of the topological susceptibility with temperature at zero density , and , more recently @xcite , it was shown that , at a fixed @xmath31 and by varying the chemical potential @xmath32 , a critical @xmath32 is found , where the quark condensate and the topological susceptibility drop and the polyakov loop raises ; its derivatives vary sharply .    a long - standing question , for which there is yet no answer , is whether the axial symmetry is restored at a temperature higher than the critical temperature for the phase transition ( scenario 1 ) or at about that temperature ( scenario 2 ) @xcite , the two scenarios leading to different predictions concerning the behavior of chiral partners in the critical region . in other words ,",
    "the question may be formulated as : is the restoration of chiral symmetry driven by quark condensates or instantons ?",
    "if it is driven by instantons , scenario 2 would be likely , implying that around the critical point signals of the restoration of u@xmath0(1 ) symmetry should already be present , as , for instance , large fluctuations in the @xmath1 spectrum .    in order to simulate the fate of the anomaly",
    ", it is usually assumed that the anomaly coefficient @xmath16 is a dropping function of temperature , whether the approach is phenomenological @xcite or lattice - inspired @xcite . in previous works @xcite",
    ", we studied the possible effective restoration of the axial symmetry . for the case of finite temperature and zero chemical potential",
    ", we explored the effects of an anomaly coupling temperature dependence @xmath33 using two different ansatz .",
    "when we modeled @xmath33 from lattice results for @xmath28 , as a fermi function , we found that : ( i ) at @xmath34 mev the chiral partners ( @xmath35 ) as well as ( @xmath36 ) become degenerate , which is a manifestation of the effective restoration of chiral symmetry plane , is taken as the critical point for the phase transition associated with partial restoration of chiral symmetry ; the point where the masses of chiral partners become degenerate signals the effective restoration of chiral or axial symmetries . ] ; ( ii ) at @xmath37 mev , @xmath38 , the pair ( @xmath2 , @xmath39 ) becomes degenerate with ( @xmath40 , @xmath1 ) and the mixing angles get close to the ideal values , indicating an effective restoration of the axial symmetry .",
    "chiral symmetry is effectively restored before axial symmetry , but , as shown in @xcite , both symmetries can be restored at the same point if @xmath33 is chosen as an appropriate decreasing exponential , a choice based on the phenomenological argument that high temperature suppresses large instanton fluctuations . to model such a decreasing exponential , we endow the anomaly coefficient with a temperature dependence in the form @xcite : @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 mev .",
    "we verified that the whole u(3)@xmath43u(3 ) symmetry is not effectively restored , in the range of temperatures considered for both lattice - inspired or decreasing exponential ansatz : ( i ) the strange quark condensate decreases slowly , and chiral symmetry in the strange sector remains broken ; ( ii ) the mesons @xmath27 and @xmath44 become purely strange , and their masses decrease moderately but do not show a tendency to converge or to get close to the other meson masses .    more recently , we performed a study of the relevant observables as functions of @xmath32 for a fixed temperature , and we verified that the combined effect of finite @xmath31 and @xmath32 does not change the usual results @xcite : chiral symmetry is effectively restored only in the non strange sector , and restoration of axial symmetry is not achieved , unless the anomaly coefficient is chosen as a dropping function of temperature or chemical potential .    in summary , neither the ansatz used for @xmath45 nor the combined effects of temperature and density , lead to a restoration of chiral and axial symmetries in the strange sector , unless the unrealistic condition of equal current quark masses for all quarks @xmath46 mev is imposed from the beginning @xcite .",
    "a subject that deserves attention is , therefore , the role played by the strange quark regarding the restoration of chiral and axial symmetries and whether the restoration of the singlet chiral symmetry could be just a consequence of the restoration of chiral symmetry or not , i.e. , whether the fate of instantons drives the mechanism of restoration of chiral symmetry or the opposite .",
    "moreover , the possible changes that could be induced in the scenarios described above by allowing quark states of high momentum to be present at high temperature should be investigated .",
    "this is achieved by means of a regularization that consists , as already referred , in letting the ultraviolet three - momentum cutoff go to infinity in all of the convergent integrals ( regularization i ) .",
    "two situations , which are summarized in table i , will be analyzed : the anomaly coefficient @xmath47 is kept constant , meaning that the restoration of symmetry is driven by the decrease of the quark condensates ( case a ) ; in order to investigate the effect of a competitive mechanism , simulating the suppression of instantons at finite temperature , we endow the anomaly coefficient with a temperature dependence in the form of eq .",
    "( [ can ] ) , with an appropriate choice of @xmath48 ( case b ) . both results will be compared with those obtained by regularizing all of the integrals with the cutoff @xmath5 ( regularization ii ) .",
    "the effects of regularization on important observables , such as the pressure and energy , will also be analyzed .",
    "[ c]| c| c| c| & anomaly coefficient @xmath16 & regularization + & @xmath49 & @xmath50 + * case a - ii * & @xmath49 & @xmath51 constant + * case b - i * & @xmath45 & @xmath50 + * case b - ii * & @xmath45 & @xmath51 constant +    [ tabelacas ]    a remark should be added concerning the choice made for @xmath45 given by eq .",
    "( [ can ] ) .",
    "we do not know which pattern of axial symmetry restoration is chosen by nature , but the variation of @xmath45 should not be at all arbitrary . by using the decreasing exponential , we might choose @xmath48 in order to have two scenarios : ( i ) restoration of axial symmetry close to chiral symmetry , provided @xmath48 is small enough ( around @xmath52 mev ) @xcite  this would give a critical temperature for the phase transition of about @xmath53 mev , much lower than the present accepted values  and ( ii ) to choose @xmath48 in order to have a critical temperature within the interval of accepted values ( @xmath54 mev leads to @xmath55 mev ) .",
    "the last point of view will be followed here .",
    "the calculations are done in a standard way @xcite . with the help of the bosonization procedure ,",
    "an effective action is obtained , allowing us to evaluate a gap equation for the constituent quark masses , the quark condensates , and the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons . to begin with ,",
    "we analyze the results for the quark masses and quark condensates that are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . the results with regularization",
    "ii , whether @xmath16 is constant ( case a - ii ) or a decreasing function of the temperature ( case b - ii ) , exhibit the following effects : the non strange quark masses decrease , although never attaining the current values , and the condensates also decrease but never vanish ; concerning the strange quarks , the mass and condensate decrease moderately and are always far from the current value for the mass and zero for the quark condensate .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have studied the effects on the restoration of chiral and axial symmetries of a regularization that consists in using an infinite cutoff in the integrals that are convergent at finite temperature .",
    "when the decrease of the quark condensates is the dominant mechanism , we found that the critical temperature , signaling the phase transition associated with partial restoration of chiral symmetry , is lower than with the conventional regularization and closer to the lattice results .",
    "the main finding is that , with the implementation of the new cutoff procedure , restoration of chiral and axial symmetries can also be a phenomenon relevant in the strange sector .",
    "in fact , the dynamically broken chiral symmetry is completely recovered , in both the strange and non - strange sectors , leading to the restoration of the axial symmetry at about the same temperature ( @xmath56 ) : the quark masses go to the current values , the quark condensates and topological susceptibility vanish , the mixing angles go to the ideal values , and the masses of the mesons , which are non - strange at @xmath56 , converge .",
    "when an ansatz that simulates independent suppression of instanton effects is taken into account , it is shown that this mechanism is relevant only for temperatures below @xmath57 mev , and shifts the temperatures for the phase transition as well as effective restoration of symmetries in the non - strange sector to lower values .",
    "regularization i also gives better results in the calculation of other observables , like the pressure and energy , that now have the expected tendency at high temperatures .",
    "the rich pattern of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking / restoration here presented and its relevance for other physical situations demands certainly further investigation . on the other hand , being aware of the simplicity of our approach , we think that a deeper look into this problems is necessary .",
    "work in this direction is in progress ."
