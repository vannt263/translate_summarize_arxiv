    "the milky way appears to be a typical spiral galaxy with a disk and bulge .",
    "while our unique inside view of the galaxy helps to understand the galactic structure in general , it also makes it more difficult to identify structures such as bars . the case for existence of a bar at the galactic centre  first proposed by @xcite  is easier to make knowing that bars are common in external galaxies .",
    "there is now conclusive evidence that the galactic bulge is of a barred type .",
    "the longitude asymmetry of the cobe photometric maps ( @xcite ) , high optical depths to gravitational microlensing ( @xcite ) , asymmetric star counts ( @xcite ) , non - circular gas kinematics ( @xcite ) , and triaxiality of the stellar velocity field ( @xcite ) have all been interpreted as signatures of the galactic bar .",
    "unfortunately , the size and precise orientation of the bar are still being debated .",
    "recently @xcite found that the infra - red star counts collected by the spitzer space telescope are best explained assuming a bar with a half - length @xmath10 kpc placed at a @xmath11 angle to the sun  galactic center line .",
    "most previous studies prefer a bar at @xmath12 extending out to @xmath93.5 kpc ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such apparently conflicting evidence may be an indication that the inner galaxy hides even more complicated structures . a secondary bar ( @xcite ) and a ring ( @xcite )",
    "have been suggested , since these features are also evident in many other spiral galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discussed the progress of the dynamical modeling techniques in the context of major observational advances expected from a future space mission gaia .",
    "the three approaches to constructing a self - consistent dynamical galaxy model are the schwarzschild method ( @xcite ) , the torus modelling method ( see @xcite for details ) and @xmath13-body simulations with particle weights determined by the `` made - to - measure '' algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first galactic bar model employing the latter method was built by @xcite .",
    "neither of these techniques can fully address the structure of the inner galaxy without constraints on stellar kinematics .",
    "the refinement of the models is limited largely by the scarcity of good proper motion and radial velocity measurements .",
    "@xcite , for example , compared kinematic predictions of their model with the data for just two lines of sight .",
    "a handful of samples published since the pioneering photographic work of @xcite is not enough to remove the non - uniqueness of the model parameters .    in a study based on two lines of sight @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that high quality relative proper motions can be obtained with a relatively modest investment of time using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . at the resolution of the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) instrument the required time baseline is only a few years .",
    "the hst archive contains a number of images suitable as the first epoch data , so the tedious part of accumulating the baseline can be avoided entirely .",
    "most of these fields are centred around microlensing events discovered by the macho collaboration ( e.g. @xcite ) . using a similar concept to that of @xcite",
    ", we carried out a mini - survey of proper motions in 35 of the available macho fields to study the kinematics of microlensed sources and of the general stellar populations . here",
    "we present the measurement techniques and results for the general stellar population in these 35 lines of sight .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : krcomp ]",
    "the study of @xcite focused on cleaning the galactic bulge population and removing the contamination by the bluer disk stars . above the bulge turn - off point ,",
    "the stellar colors alone are sufficient to separate the blue disk main sequence from the red giants , subgiants and clump giants .",
    "the size of our fields is generally too small to provide useful statistics of bright stars above turn - off point , and good color information is only available for about 1/3 of the lines of sight .",
    "however , three of the fields in table  [ tab : data ] with useful colors ( 97-blg-18 , 104-c and 104-d ) are close to each other and were combined in order to look for a kinematic distinction between the galactic disk and bulge populations .",
    "figs  [ fig : cmd_pm_dist ] and [ fig : pm_dist ] show that in the frame of reference of a mean star ( of any color ) , the longitude proper motions of the blue disk stars are biased toward positive values , while the red bulge stars tend to have more negative @xmath14 .",
    "the blue and red samples were selected , correspondingly , using conditions @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this effect was previously observed by @xcite and by @xcite in their two fields with multi - epoch wfpc2 data and there is little doubt that it is due to the blue disk stars `` rotating in front '' of the red bulge stars .",
    "@xcite also devised an approximate distance measure : @xmath17    chosen to remove the slope of the main sequence in the color - magnitude diagram . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kr2 ] we present the average proper motions and their dispersions for the baade window in bins of @xmath18 .",
    "as expected , with an increasing depth along the line of sight , the kinematic signature gradually changes from that characteristic of the disk stars , to the one typical for the bulge . in the @xcite data this trend continues to very faint stars that are likely on the far side of the bulge , and",
    "if so , it constitutes a `` rotation curve '' of the bulge .",
    "the colors for our fields are generally of lower s / n ratio or nonexistent , and do not allow to see this much detail .",
    "a detailed modeling of the measurements in table  [ tab : pm_results ] is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we only comment on possible directions and new possibilities .",
    "@xcite interpreted the bulge anisotropy in terms of the rotation support of the galactic bulge and related the ratio @xmath7 directly to the level of flattening of the light density distribution .",
    "they also concluded that the value @xmath191.15 observed in baade window @xmath20 , with which our measurements are consistent , can be explained by rigid rotation .",
    "the presence of any disk stars , however , will also contribute rotational broadening to @xmath5 .",
    "since in the vicinity of our fields the disk fraction increases closer to the plane , it follows that the measured gradient from equation  ( [ eq : sigl_b ] ) could be due to the disk contamination .",
    "the changes of skewness in the @xmath14 distribution tend to support this ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pm_dist ] ) .",
    "another possibility is that the rotation rate of the bulge actually increases at lower @xmath21 , as found by @xcite from the radial velocities of 124 sio masers in the galactic bulge .",
    "it has been observed that for giants in baade window the metal - poor stars display more spread in the vertical motion and less anisotropy when compared to metal - rich samples ( @xcite ) .",
    "both of these metallicity dependencies are quite steep , so it is likely that the gradient from equation  ( [ eq : sigb_l ] ) is related to a changing mix of populations with more metal - poor stars closer to the galactic bulge minor axis .",
    "we are not aware of any previous detections of the cross terms in the galactic bulge velocity field except the report by @xcite of a significant vertex deviation between the radial and longitudinal motions from @xmath22 .",
    "that result is based on a photographic sample of @xmath9200 k and m giants from @xcite .",
    "we note that the latter sample actually shows a hint of a slightly negative covariance between @xmath14 and @xmath23 ( c.f . fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the superb resolution of hst enabled very significant detections of the @xmath24 cross term in many fields .",
    "the non - diagonal elements of the velocity tensor are crucial to determining the dominant orbit families , the importance of streaming motions and the need for the intrinsic anisotropy versus solid body rotation in the galactic bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite published detailed calculations of @xmath24 for several lines of sight at positive longitudes including baade window @xmath25 , and two other : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "taken at face value these predictions are roughly of the same magnitude as the results from  [ sec : results ] , but have the opposite sign . for a proper comparison with dynamical models like the ones in @xcite and",
    "@xcite we need to wait until the calculations are folded with the appropriate selection functions , since our measurements are based on substantially deeper data than most of the previous samples .",
    "the main results of our proper motion mini - survey are : ( 1 ) high quality proper motion measurements for hundreds of stars in 35 lines of sight across the galactic bar , ( 2 ) establishing the presence of spatial gradients in dispersions @xmath28 and the amount of anisotropy @xmath7 , and ( 3 ) the first reliable detection of the covariance term @xmath24 of the transverse velocity tensor .",
    "we cross - validated our measurements with the ground based ogle - ii data of @xcite and a benchmark study of @xcite . the observed slow rise of @xmath5 toward the galactic plane is likely due to the increasing disk contamination and/or a possible gradient in the bulge rotation speed .",
    "the increase in @xmath6 toward the minor axis of the bulge is accompanied by the decreasing ratio @xmath7 and possibly results from increasing fraction of metal - poor stars .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath6 increases due to the larger surface density of stars at low @xmath29 ( closer to the galactic centre ) .",
    "we clearly detect the covariance term @xmath30 that implies a significant tilt of the galactic bulge velocity ellipsoid with respect to the galactic plane . using the same procedures as in @xcite , we find the tilt is roughly equal to @xmath31 .",
    "the data presented in this paper provide qualitatively new constraints on dynamical models of the inner galaxy and dramatically improved number statistics .",
    "furthermore , it may be possible in the near future to augment our proper motion samples with the distance and metallicity estimates . as shown by @xcite",
    ", deep color - magnitude diagrams can supply sufficiently accurate distance information to effectively isolate the bulge population . in order to maximize the discriminating power of model comparisons",
    "the focus should be on extending the coverage to negative longitudes and locations further from the galactic centre .",
