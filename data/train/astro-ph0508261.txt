    "the measure and extent of the dust absorption by spiral disks has been the subject of study and even controversy for some time .",
    "new models of the disk s energy household ( e.g. @xcite ) and a wealth of observational data ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , promise a better understanding of the role of dust in the disks .",
    "still , there are several questions regarding the distribution of dust clouds in the spiral disk which should be addressed : to which radius does dust extend and is dust spatially correlated to the stellar distribution or the atomic hydrogen gas ?",
    "one possible technique to answer these questions is to use the number of distant galaxies seen through a foreground disk as an indicator of disk opacity .",
    "[ fig : method ]",
    "for a useful measurement , one needs to calibrate the number of distant galaxies seen through a foreground for effects other than the extinction by dust .",
    "the calibration is done with the `` synthetic field method '' ( figure [ fig : method ] ) . the distant galaxies in the science field",
    "are counted ( step 1 ) .",
    "an average background field is added to the science field to create a `` synthetic field '' .",
    "the average background field is artificially dimmed in progressive `` synthetic fields '' ( step 2 ) .",
    "the numbers of retrieved synthetic galaxies for each value of the dimming is found ( step 3 ) .",
    "the relation @xmath0 is fitted to the relation between the numbers of galaxies ( n ) and the dimming ( a ) of the synthetic fields ( step 4 ) .",
    "the free parameters are the slope ( @xmath1 ) and the number of galaxies without any dimming ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the intersection between the fit and the number of actual distant galaxies found in the science field gives the average opacity of the science field ( step 5 ) .",
    "this comparison between counts can be done for individual fields but also for multiple fields , combined based on disk characteristics : radius , arm or disk region , surface brightness or hi column density .",
    "figure [ fig : ra ] shows the stacked radial opacity profile of our entire sample of 32 hst / wfpc2 fields . from figure",
    "[ fig : ra ] , we can conclude that the average radial opacity profile of spiral galaxies remains relatively flat for most of the disk and only tapers off somewhere beyond the @xmath3 .",
    "this was already suspected from sub - mm observations ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this profile has not been corrected for inclination effects , as this depends greatly on the assumed dust geometry .",
    "the average color of the galaxies in the science fields does not change however ( figure [ fig : ra ] , top panel ) .",
    "if the diminishing effect of the dust in the ism would have been due to a uniform screen , the average color would have changed with the total amount of attenuation according to an extinction law . however ,",
    "if the dust in the disk is relatively patchy , the attenuation is derived from the number of absent galaxies while the color is from those that have been detected relatively unhindered by dust in the disk .",
    "the average disk opacity in figure [ fig : ra ] can therefore be interpreted as a cloud covering factor .",
    "[ fig : ra ]    separate profiles for the arm and disk sections of the foreground galaxy can also be made ( figure [ fig : kw ] ) .",
    "these opacity profiles show a strong radial relation in the arms and a much flatter profile in the rest of the disk .",
    "when these profiles are compared to the opacity values from occulted galaxy pairs ( @xcite ) , there is a remarkably good agreement between these completely different methods .",
    "@xcite also found a gray behaviour but @xcite found that the galactic extinction law re - emerged for measurements below a linear scale in the disk smaller than 100 pc .",
    "[ fig : kw ]",
    "the strong radial relation for the spiral arms hints at a direct relation between the amount of dust in the disk and the surface brightness of the disk .",
    "a similar relation between overall disk opacity and brightness was found by @xcite .",
    "however the much flatter distribution of the opacity in the rest of the disk does suggest that the dust may be more distributed like the atomic hydrogen .    to find the relation between opacity and surface brightness , each distant galaxy , from both synthetic and science fields ,",
    "are flagged with the surface brightness in 2mass images .",
    "the numbers of galaxies as a function of near - infrared surface brightness are shown in figure [ fig : sb ] for all of the disk and the arm and non - arm regions separate . as could be expected from figure [ fig : kw ]",
    ", there is a strong relation between surface brightness and opacity in the arm regions but none in the non - arm part of the disk .",
    "[ fig : sb ]    the relation between atomic hydrogen and dust might reveal more on the hidden constituents of the ism .",
    "due to limitations of the sfm measurements and lack of hi maps , figure [ fig : hi ] shows the ratio of the hi column density from radial profiles from the literature and the opacity measured from counts of galaxies in the same radial bin .",
    "no direct relation is evident , mainly because opacity profiles rise towards the center of galaxies and hi profiles stay flat or decrease .",
    "it is possible that dust correlates with the total gas content in the disk , both the molecular and the atomic .",
    "[ fig : hi ]",
    "the counts of distant galaxies have proven themselves to be a good indicator of disk opacity , provided they are calibrated with the sfm . improved statistics from many hst fields have lent insight into the distribution of dust in the disk and into the relation with the stellar content and atomic gas .",
    "the radial opacity profile extends to well beyond the optical disk and appears caused by patchy dust .",
    "the dust clouds correlate with stellar light in the arms but there is additional constant disk component which is more dominant at higher radii .",
    "the radial profile implies that there are dust clouds outside the optical disk .",
    "this seems in agreement with the sings extinction maps ( @xcite ) and pah emission maps from the sings project ( @xcite ) but an exact comparison remains to be made .",
    "however , we know that starformation and hii regions can be found at hitherto unprecedented radii .",
    "the presence of dust is therefore not unreasonable .",
    "the question remains how much there is .",
    "one implication of the relation between opacity and surface brightness in the arms is that a light - profile derived from the non - arm regions can be a maximum disk or a scaling of that but that a profile that includes the arm regions will be less concentrated than the actual distribution of mass .",
    "this may be another contributor to a slightly different normalization of the @xcite color - m / l relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the profiles of opacity and hi column density are not correlated .",
    "since the opacity keeps rising in the center , it is very possible that the overall disk opacity relates in some way to the total gas content or even just the molecular component .",
    "a similar radial profile and hi - to - dust ratio for spiral disks have also been found in sub - mm observations of disks .",
    "this implies that a substantial fraction of the dust responsible for the disk opacity is cold .",
    "future application of the counts of distant galaxies include probing the edge of the dust disk , constraining the average cloud size , a comparison with sub - mm observations to constrain dust emissivity and a direct comparison with column density"
