    "over the last several years , much attention has focused on the multiscale inhomogeneities observed in perovskite manganites .",
    "@xcite unlike inhomogeneities for some other complex electronic systems , such as stripes in high - t@xmath0 cuprates , the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases within the same crystals of manganites has been directly observed through various high resolution local probes , such as dark field images and scanning microscopy .",
    "@xcite nanoscale inhomogeneities have also been implied based on x - ray diffraction results .",
    "@xcite theories based on chemical randomness and electronic phase separation have been proposed as a mechanism for such inhomogeneities .",
    "@xcite however , theories based on chemical randomness alone assume an exact degeneracy between metallic and insulating phases ,  @xcite which ultimately leads to a homogeneous phase .",
    "@xcite also , the effect of the coulomb interaction has not been incorporated adequately into the model describing electronic phase separation .",
    "@xcite    we have previously proposed an _ intrinsic _",
    "mechanism for phase coexistence ,  @xcite in which the interaction between strain fields plays an important role , as speculated in earlier literature .",
    "@xcite specifically , our model  @xcite includes intrinsic complexity of the energy landscape and long range anisotropic interaction between strain fields , and shows how such physics can give rise to multiscale inhomogeneities observed in manganites .",
    "our theoretical idea is supported by experimental results .",
    "@xcite for example , the observed large scale inhomogeneity of the order of 10 @xmath1 m without any observable chemical inhomogeneity at a length scale of 0.5 @xmath1 m or larger , suggests an intrinsic mechanism for the phase coexistence .",
    "@xcite the lamellar morphology of coexisting phases observed in manganites and the change of domain configurations upon thermal cycling between 10 k and 300 k further support this point of view .",
    "@xcite it is also found that the anisotropic epitaxial strain in thin films gives rise to anisotropic percolation , which suggests that the origin of phase coexistence is much more strongly affected by long range strain rather than by local chemical inhomogeneity due to doping .",
    "@xcite    in contrast to the point of view in refs .   and   that considers _ extrinsic _ mechanism such as chemical inhomogeneity and disorder as being key to understanding coexistence of metallic and insulating phases",
    ", our work proposes that the _ intrinsic _ mechanism , that is , the competition between the short and long range interactions , creates a delicate energy landscape that leads to domain formation .",
    "further , the domain walls can be pinned by the atomistic peierls - nabarro force , rather than by disorder which is frequently attributed as being the cause for the phenomenon .",
    "@xcite we proposed the basic ideas in ref .  , but now develop them further and describe more extensive implementation of the approach here .",
    "specifically , we present details of our model , methods , and results , as well as further simulations on the stability of phase coexistence . in sect .",
    "ii , the details of the hamiltonian used for the simulations in ref .  , and",
    "results obtained with various initial conditions and parameters , are presented .",
    "we also contrast these results with simulations for a system that include short range interactions only . in sect .",
    "iii , we discuss the mechanism underlying the stability of micron - scale phase coexistence through further simulations and analysis . in sect .",
    "iv , we summarize our main results .",
    "expressions for energies and energy gradients used for simulations of the inhomogeneous states are provided in appendices a and b , respectively .",
    "perovskite manganites typically have the chemical formula @xmath2mno@xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents rare earth elements , such as la , nd , and pr , and @xmath5 represents alkali metal elements such as ca and sr .",
    "@xcite the important electrons for both electronic properties and structures are the @xmath6 electrons on mn ions : the degeneracy of the @xmath6 orbitals leads to a strong jahn - teller electron - lattice coupling . shortly after the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance in these materials ,  @xcite the importance of strong electron - lattice coupling was pointed out to explain the large resistivity above the ferromagnetic transition temperature in terms of dynamic jahn - teller polarons .",
    "@xcite the same strong electron - lattice coupling is also responsible for a large structural difference between the low temperature metallic and insulating phases of these materials . in the insulating phase ,",
    "the @xmath6 electrons are localized and the charge density forms an ordered pattern . the orbital states of the @xmath6 electrons , which are linear combinations of two @xmath6 orbital states , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are also ordered . due to the static jahn - teller effect , such a charge and orbital ordered state accompanies uniform and short wavelength lattice distortions .",
    "for example , the long mn - o bond ( or the elongated @xmath6 electron orbital ) in la@xmath9ca@xmath9mno@xmath3 alternates its direction in a plane , which gives rise to short wavelength lattice distortions .",
    "@xcite along the direction perpendicular to this plane , the short mn - o bond repeats itself , and therefore the unit cell is compressed along this orientation , giving uniform or long - wavelength lattice distortions .",
    "in contrast , the lattice in the metallic ground state of manganites has a structure close to an ideal cubic perovskite structure without jahn - teller lattice distortions because the electrons are delocalized .",
    "the ground state can be changed between metallic and insulating phases in various ways , such as by the size of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , applied magnetic fields , or applied pressures .",
    "@xcite    we propose that the first key to the understanding of the phase coexistence in manganites is the metastability , which has been observed in many experiments . for example , the distorted insulating phase of manganites can be transformed into the undistorted metallic phase by either x - rays  @xcite or magnetic fields ,  @xcite and the metallic phase does not revert to the insulating phase even after the external perturbation is removed . in particular , in x - ray experiments ,  @xcite the reduction of the superlattice peak intensity and the simultaneous increase of conductivity , while the sample is exposed to the x - rays , demonstrate the transformation of the insulating phase into the metallic phase and the presence of inhomogeneity . however , an energy landscape with local and global energy minima is not sufficient to explain the observed sub - micron scale inhomogeneity , because such inhomogeneity is unstable against thermal fluctuations . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", an unusual aspect of inhomogeneity in manganites is its stability over a 100 k range in temperature , which is an indication of an extra mechanism at play that affects phase coexistence in manganites .",
    "based on the strong electron - lattice coupling mentioned above and experiments showing the important role of strain in metal - insulator transition in manganites ,  @xcite we propose that the extra mechanism should be related to the long range anisotropic interaction between _ strain _ fields .",
    "it is thus essential to consider the energy landscape in terms of the lattice distortion variables , which will ultimately have a bearing on other degrees of freedom such as magnetic moment or electron density .",
    "the origin of the long range anisotropic interaction within this framework is the bonding constraint , often referred to as strain compatibility .",
    "the compatibility condition enforces single - valued strain fields without broken bonds .",
    "@xcite the anisotropy reflects the discrete rotational symmetry associated with the lattice structures .",
    "such long - range anisotropic interactions are responsible , for example , for well - defined structural twin boundaries  @xcite over distances of 100  @xmath10 .",
    "the cubic phase of perovskite manganites contains five atoms per unit cell .",
    "the insulating charge and orbital ordered phase consists of a zig - zag pattern of the long mn - o bond orientation , which further increases the number of atoms per unit cell .",
    "inclusion of such details is necessary for a complete description of properties of these materials . for the current study ,",
    "however , we wish to focus on the following three key features of manganites essential for multiscale inhomogeneity , and capture them in a simple model .",
    "_ first _ , the metallic phase has almost no lattice distortions in comparison with the charge and orbital ordered insulating phase .",
    "_ second _ , the insulating ground state has a uniform or long wavelength ( @xmath11 ) lattice distortion .",
    "this property is essential because it is the long wavelength distortion , not the short wavelength one , that gives rise to the long range anisotropic interaction between strain fields .",
    "_ third _ , the insulating phase has a short wavelength lattice distortion , in addition to the uniform distortion .",
    "as we will show below , the symmetry - allowed coupling between uniform and short - wavelength distortions gives rise naturally to an energy landscape with multiple minima .",
    "before we introduce our model , we examine whether a simpler 2-dimensional ( 2d ) model can be used instead of a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) model , in particular to capture the effect of the long - range strain - strain interactions . in d",
    "- dimensional space ( d = 2 or 3 ) , the anisotropic strain - strain interaction decays as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 represents the distance between two points .",
    "@xcite the spatial integration of @xmath12 would give rise to a logarithmic divergence in both 2 and 3 dimensional space ,  @xcite which indicates that the effect of the interaction would be similar for both cases .",
    "indeed , recent simulations of strains in 2 and 3 dimensional space show very similar results .",
    "@xcite thus , we limit ourselves in this work to a 2d model for simplicity",
    ".    one of the simplest lattices in 2d space is the square lattice with a monatomic basis shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : square ] . by considering one isotropic electron orbital per site and nearest neighbor electron hopping",
    ", the lattice supports a metallic electron density of states ( dos ) without a gap .",
    "therefore , such an undistorted square lattice shares the first property for manganites mentioned above . to include the second property",
    ", we deform the square unit cell of the lattice to a rectangular unit cell , either along the horizontal or vertical directions . to include the third property ,",
    "we incorporate the @xmath14 type displacements of atoms along the horizontal ( vertical ) direction for a rectangular lattice elongated along the vertical ( horizontal ) direction .",
    "rectangular lattices with such short wavelength lattice distortions support an electron dos with a gap at the center , if we consider the natural electron hopping amplitude modulation by the changes in interatomic distances .",
    "therefore , such lattices have an insulating dos for the electron density of half an electron per site . even though the 2d lattice described above",
    "is simple , it shares all the three properties of manganites that we believe are essential for the observed inhomogeneity , and provides a testing ground for whether the complex energy landscape and long range strain - strain interaction can indeed give rise to self - consistent multiscale inhomogeneities .",
    "we require an energy expression for which the undistorted and distorted lattices described above are the local and global energy minimum states .",
    "for this purpose , we use an atomic - scale mode - based description of lattice distortions that we developed recently .",
    "@xcite in this method , we use normal modes of a square plaquette of four atoms , instead of displacement variables , to describe lattice distortions .",
    "these atomic scale modes for the monatomic square lattice are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] .",
    "the first three modes are long wave length modes , since they can be obtained by uniformly deforming the square lattice .",
    "the last two modes , which correspond to @xmath14 staggered distortions of the lattice , are short wavelength modes . for a square lattice ,",
    "each atom is shared by four neighboring plaquettes , which makes the modes at neighboring plaquettes dependent on each other .",
    "such a constraint can be expressed in terms of equations in the fourier transformed space , and the five modes can describe any lattice distortion for the square lattice with a monatomic basis . in the long wavelength limit ,",
    "the three long wavelength modes become identical to the familiar strain modes , which makes our approach ideal for describing nano - and micro - meter scale inhomogeneities within the same theoretical framework .",
    "the inclusion of constraints allows our method to automatically generate the effects of the long range anisotropic interaction , the origin of which is the short - range bonding constraint .",
    "we consider an @xmath15 square lattice with a modified periodic condition explained below .",
    "the displacement variables for the atom at the site @xmath16 are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the distance between the nearest neighbor atoms , @xmath19 , is irrelevant to our formalism presented below , and can be chosen depending on the relative size of the distortions compared to the lattice constants . in all the figures in this paper , @xmath19 is chosen as 10 so that the size of the distortion relative to the interatomic distance is of the same order of the magnitude as observed in charge and orbital ordered manganites . in general , the displacement of atoms in a periodic structure can be described using two components .",
    "one is the component that changes monotonically as the site indices shift along a direction .",
    "this component , represented by a superscript ` @xmath20 ' below , can not be fourier - transformed and corresponds to the uniform distortion of the lattice . the rest of the displacement , represented by a superscript ` @xmath21 ' below , can be fourier - transformed and is subject to the periodic boundary condition .",
    "therefore , we express the displacements as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 we note that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are obtained through the fourier transformation of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , rather than @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the periodic boundary condition results in @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the rigid rotation of the whole system",
    "is excluded , since it is irrelevant to the potential energy change .",
    "similarly , the @xmath36 components of @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the rigid translation of the whole system , which are set to zero .    for the square lattice , we define the symmetry modes shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : modes ] as follows : @xmath37 these modes are fully subject to the periodic boundary condition , e.g. , @xmath38 , unlike the displacement variables .",
    "thus , they can be fourier - transformed , for example , according to @xmath39 from the definitions , we find @xmath40 and @xmath41 , \\label{eq : e1kne0}\\\\          e_{2}(\\vec{k}\\neq 0 ) & = & \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left[-(1+e^{ik_x})(1-e^{ik_y})u^{x}_{\\vec{k } }               -(1-e^{ik_x})(1+e^{ik_y})u^{y}_{\\vec{k}}\\right ] , \\label{eq : e2kne0}\\\\          e_{3}(\\vec{k}\\neq 0 ) & = & \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left[-(1-e^{ik_x})(1+e^{ik_y})u^{x}_{\\vec{k } }               + ( 1+e^{ik_x})(1-e^{ik_y})u^{y}_{\\vec{k}}\\right ] , \\label{eq : e3kne0}\\\\          s_{x}(\\vec{k}\\neq 0 ) & = &   \\frac{1}{2}(1-e^{ik_x})(1-e^{ik_y})u^{x}_{\\vec{k } } , \\label{eq : sxkne0}\\\\          s_{y}(\\vec{k}\\neq 0 ) & = &   \\frac{1}{2}(1-e^{ik_x})(1-e^{ik_y})u^{y}_{\\vec{k}}. \\label{eq : sykne0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that the @xmath36 components of the symmetry modes are from @xmath34 and @xmath35 , while @xmath36 components of @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not contribute to the distortion modes .",
    "the five variables are related by three constraint equations , because only two physically independent displacement variables exist for each site . as discussed in ref .",
    ", these constraint equations are found from the relations between the symmetry modes and the displacement variables in reciprocal space .",
