    "secondary electron emission from solids by electron bombardment has been subject of experimental and theoretical studies for many decades @xcite , with a wide variety of applications including voltage contrast in scanning electron microscopy , micro channel plates , plasma display panels , electron beam inspection tools . in space",
    ", attention has focused on see from spacecraft surfaces or small dust particles caused by auroral electrons or hot electrons in planetary magnetospheres @xcite . to date , theoretical studies of see usually involve a slab model which often gives a reasonable estimate of the see yield ( but see also @xcite and discussion below ) . in this paper , we show that the interplay between the penetration depth of primary electrons , the escape depth of secondary electrons and the size of surface structure ( surface curvature ) can be the dominant mechanism for the see from small objects . moreover",
    "the see from configurations involving nano structures are of fundamental importance for basic science as well as for applications @xcite ranging from astrophysics to technological processes .",
    "the detailed understanding and proper interpretation of the see yield from either nano - scaled structures on surfaces or nano - sized objects is strongly desired because such knowledge is , for instance , important for scanning electron microscope imaging of small objects and any charging processes where secondary electron currents are involved .",
    "the total electron yield is often written as a sum @xmath1 of elastically ( @xmath2 ) and inelastically ( @xmath3 ) backscattered electrons ( bse ) as well as true secondary electrons ( se ) ( @xmath4 ) . for incident electrons with energies in the range where the see",
    "dominates ( typically above @xmath5 ) elastically and inelastically backscattered primaries ( @xmath6 ) constitute only a small fraction of the total yield @xcite . in the literature , it is common to use the simplifying assumption of see from a large , planar sample @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the energy dependence of the see yield can be described by the sternglass universal curve @xcite , when the yield is normalized by the maximum yield and the primary electron energy by the energy where the yield is maximized @xcite .",
    "however a series of measurements of see covering a wide range of primary energies @xcite shows that the theory of sternglass fails to fit the experimental data at high primary electron energy .",
    "the empirical formula developed by draine and salpeter @xcite generally shows a better agreement with experiments but overestimates the data .",
    "later chow et al .",
    "@xcite have modified the yield equation by jonker @xcite and derived the yield for secondary emission from a spherical dust grain immersed in a plasma environment .",
    "the influence of porosity on electron - induced see was considered by millet and lafon @xcite .",
    "there are also some numerical models of see from dust grains @xcite .",
    "however all these approaches assume a smooth surface of the object .",
    "the first attempt to include surface structures have been made by nishimura et al .",
    "their monte carlo simulations have shown that neglecting the surface roughness may considerably underestimate the magnitude of the secondary electron yield .",
    "these results are in a good agreement with the characteristics of low secondary and reflected primary electron emissions from textured surfaces measured by wintucky et al .",
    "in this paper , we study the effect of small spatial surface structures of three - dimensional samples on the see efficiency .",
    "we suggest an analytical expression for the see yield accounting for the effect of surface curvature in an approach generalizing existing elementary see models .",
    "we show that the presence of small structures on a sample surface destroys the universal dependence of yield on energy .",
    "moreover , we find a significant growth of the electron yield .",
    "physically , the deviation from the universal behavior occurs because the curvature radii of individual surface structures can be significantly different from the sample s overall radius of curvature . to highlight this effect",
    "we consider two elementary examples of surface structures like a single small spherical grain [ figure [ fig : imperf](a ) ] and a single bump on a flat sample s surface [ figure [ fig : imperf](b ) ] .",
    "surface structures of more complex shape can be reduced to these elementary ones . for comparison",
    "we also give the see characteristics in the case of a smooth surface [ figure [ fig : imperf](c ) ] . here",
    ", we deal with the case when the density of surface structures is low , i.e. when the distance between structural elements is much larger than their size .",

    "the distance normal to the surface from which the secondaries escape .",
