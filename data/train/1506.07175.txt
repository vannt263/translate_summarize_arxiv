    "ever since its discovery in the early days of radio astronomy , the powerful radio galaxy cygnus  a @xcite has been an important proving ground for our models of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and the relativistic jets that they produce .",
    "it is extremely radio luminous , with a 178mhz luminosity more than an order of magnitude larger than any other 3c source in the local ( @xmath8 ) universe @xcite  indeed , one needs to reach out to the @xmath9 universe before finding many other sources of comparable radio luminosity .",
    "much of the radio emission originates from two edge - brightened radio lobes that are fed by relativistic and highly collimated back - to - back jets produced by the agn , making cygnus  a the archetypal example of a fanaroff - riley type - ii ( frii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) classical double radio galaxy .",
    "studies of the central engine of cygnus  a are hampered by heavy obscuration .",
    "the discovery of a broad mgii line in the ultraviolet spectrum @xcite and broad h@xmath10 in the polarized optical spectrum @xcite makes it clear that the central engine of cygnus  a is a broad - line quasar , as previously suggested by @xcite on the basis of infrared ( ir ) imaging .",
    "interestingly , cygnus  a appears to be only a modestly powerful quasar despite powering an ultra - luminous radio - source @xcite .",
    "a recent demonstration of this was given by @xcite who model the radio - to - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , concluding that the ir luminosity is dominated by the agn with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath11 , typical of a low - power quasar .",
    "for a black hole mass of @xmath12 , determined via _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "spectroscopy of a nuclear gas disk @xcite , this bolometric luminosity implies a modest eddington ratio of @xmath13 .",
    "substantially more power is believed to emerge in a kinetic form associated with the relativistic jets ; using the dynamics of the cocoon , @xcite estimate a total jet power in the range @xmath14 .",
    "an additional reason for the anomalous radio - loudness of cygnus  a is its unusual environment  it is hosted by the cd galaxy of a cooling core cluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the high pressure core of the intracluster medium ( icm ) provides a working surface for the jets and confines the radio lobes , thereby greatly increasing the synchrotron emissivity of the shocked jet plasma .",
    "hard x - ray spectroscopy is a powerful way to probe the central engines of deeply buried agn such as cygnus  a , although the presence of the x - ray luminous icm complicates such studies . while the x - ray emission from the cygnus  a cluster was detected by the _",
    "observatory @xcite , the harder spectral response of the medium - energy ( me ) telescope on _ exosat _ was required to first detect the additional hard x - ray emission from the absorbed nucleus @xcite .",
    "_ ginga _ permitted a robust detection of the agn continuum out to 20kev @xcite ; the continuum was well described by a power - law with photon index @xmath15 and 210kev intrinsic luminosity of @xmath16 absorbed by a neutral column density of @xmath17 .",
    "this basic picture , albeit with a somewhat flatter photon index ( @xmath18 ) , was confirmed by @xcite who used a combination of _ chandra _ and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ to map the agn emission out to 100kev . by using its superior spatial resolution to isolate the nuclear emission ,",
    "_ chandra _ found x - ray reprocessing of the agn continuum in the form of a weak 6.4kev fluorescent line of cold iron .",
    "however , the non - imaging nature of the instruments on _ rxte _ meant that the hard x - ray spectra were strongly background dominated .    in this paper , we present observations of cygnus  a by the",
    "_ nuclear spectroscopic telescopic array _",
    "( _ nustar _ ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the imaging capability of this focusing x - ray observatory , with a half - power diameter of just 60arcsec @xcite , allows us to produce a high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , source - dominated spectrum of cygnus  a out to almost 80kev .",
    "the unprecedented quality of this spectrum allows us to search for the presence of compton reflection signatures , constrain any high - energy cutoff of the continuum , and search for highly ionized outflows for the first time in this keystone object .",
    "an important complication , however , is the contribution of the icm emission in the softest bands of _ nustar _ and the all important iron k - shell band .",
    "thus , our _ nustar _",
    "analysis must be informed by additional soft x - ray ( 0.510kev ) imaging - spectroscopy that allows us to construct a spectral model for the icm . at first glance ,",
    "the moderately deep _ chandra _",
    "observations ( totaling 200ks ) of cygnus - a @xcite would appear to be the datasets of choice for this exercise .",
    "however , the agn itself suffers extreme photon pile - up during these observations ( compromising the integrity of any global icm+agn spectrum ) , and the hard x - ray wings of the _ chandra _ psf noticeably contaminate the inner 10arcsec of the icm with agn emission ( compromising the ability to spatially isolate the icm emission ) .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the best constraint on the icm emission contaminating our _ nustar _ view of the nucleus , we turn to archival _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the _ nustar _ and",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations and the basic data reduction steps are described in section  2 .",
    "section  3 gives a preliminary discussion of the _ nustar _ image of cygnus  a , although we defer a detailed imaging analysis , including the search for extended hard x - ray emission from non - thermal particles , to a future publication .",
    "section  4 presents our analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data . with the _ xmm - newton _ icm model in hand",
    ", we describe the analysis of the _ nustar _ spectrum in section  5 .",
    "section  6 discusses the astrophysical implications of our results . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume the standard _ planck _",
    "cosmology @xcite .",
    "at a redshift of @xmath19 , this places cygnus  a at a luminosity distance of 237 , with a linear - angular conversion of 1.0kpc per arcsec .",
    "_ nustar _ observed cygnus  a on 17/18-feb-2013 and 1-mar-2013 with a total observation length of 80ks and 40ks respectively . the data from both focal plane modules ( fpma and fpmb ) and both observations were reprocessed and cleaned using the most recent version of the _ nustar _ pipeline ( within heasoftv16.6 ) and calibration files ( caldb version 20140715 ) , resulting in 43.6ks and 20.7ks of good on - source exposure for the first and second observation , respectively .",
    "although we briefly discuss the imaging data in the next section , this paper focuses on the agn at the heart of cygnus  a. we extracted spectra and light curves from a 30arcsec radius circular region centered on the nucleus ( dashed circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "our chosen extraction region is somewhat smaller than usual in order to minimize the contribution of the icm .",
    "background spectra and light curves were extracted from two circular regions that are free of any obvious point sources and flank the nucleus by 4arcmin . to remain within the well - calibrated regime ,",
    "this paper considers the 370kev _ nustar _ spectrum and we rebin the data to a minimum of 20 photons per energy channel in order to facilitate the use of @xmath20-statistics .",
    "the ( folded ) background - subtracted source spectra for the two fpm are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_and_background ] along with the corresponding background spectra .",
    "we see that the spectra are source - dominated across the whole 370kev  the background contributes only 5% at 7kev increasing to 25% at 70kev .",
    "examination of the background - subtracted light curves reveals no evidence for time variability within an observation ; this has been tested with lightcurves employing 500s , 1000s , and 2000s bins .",
    "this result stands , even when we restrict our attention to energies above 10kev ( thereby largely removing the contribution of the constant icm component ) .",
    "additionally , between the two observations , the average background - subtracted 370kev count rate of each fpm is found to be constant within errors .",
    "hence , we combine the data from the two observations to produce a single spectrum ( for each fpm ) with a total exposure time of 64.3ks . there is a 1.7% offset in the count rate between the two fpms ( with count rates of @xmath21cps for fpma and @xmath22cps for the fpmb ) that we attribute to residual errors in the flux calibration of the two instruments . in all of the spectral fitting",
    "performed in this paper , we fit for the cross - normalization of the two fpms thereby removing this cross - calibration error .      _",
    "xmm - newton _ observed cygnus  a on 14-oct-2005 ( 22.5ks ) and 16-oct-2005 ( 18.8ks ) .",
    "here we consider just the imaging spectroscopy data from the epic - pn detector .",
    "these data were extracted from the heasarc archives and reprocessed using the epchain tool within sasv13.5.0 .",
    "after applying standard filtering criteria ( described in the _ xmm - newton _ abc guide ) , the first and second observations yielded 18.3ks and 15.0ks of good on - source data , respectively .",
    "our motivation for examining the epic - pn data is to give context to our _ nustar _ study .",
    "hence , for each of the two observations , we extract spectra from the _ nustar _ extraction radius , a 30arcsec radius circular region centered on the nucleus .",
    "background spectra were extracted from a region approximately 4arcmin from the nucleus that is free from any obvious point sources .",
    "the source and background spectra were appropriately scaled ( using the backscale tool ) , and response matrices and effective area curves generated ( using the rmfgen and arfgen tools ) . finally , given the proximity in time of the two observations and the lack of any detected variability between these two observations , the two spectra were combined into a single spectrum with an exposure of 33.3ks . to remain within the well - calibrated regime ,",
    "this paper considers the 0.510kev epic - pn spectrum and we rebin the data to a minimum of 20 photons per energy channel in order to facilitate the use of @xmath20-statistics .",
    "a detailed study of the hard x - ray imaging data for cygnus  a , including constraints on non - thermal x - ray emission from the cygnus  a cluster , is deferred to a future paper . here , we present a preliminary discussion of the imaging data to the extent required to set up the analysis of the nuclear spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows the 0.510kev _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn image of the cygnus  a along with _",
    "images made in four bands ( 35kev , 510kev , 1020kev and 2040kev ) . for reference , we also show the 0.55kev _ chandra_/acis image .",
    "all frames are overlaid with contours of the classic 6 cm _ very large array _ ( vla ) map of @xcite as well as the _ nustar _ extraction radius ( dashed circle ) .",
    "each frame has been scaled with a logarithmic color map spanning a dynamic range of 100 .",
    "the _ chandra _ image clearly shows the prolate ellipsoidal cocoon blown by the radio galaxy activity @xcite .",
    "the emission visible beyond this cocoon is the ambient icm .",
    "as previously noted by @xcite , the cocoon appears to be wrapped with x - ray bright filaments , the origin of which is unclear .",
    "we see that the _ nustar _",
    "extraction radius fits within the radio lobes and encompasses the inner portions of the jet - blown cocoon . in the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn image ,",
    "the cocoon structure is less distinct but the x - ray emission from the radio hot - spots is easily visible . in _ nustar _",
    ", as expected , the extended cluster emission is also prominent in the 35kev image .",
    "however , as can be see from the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] , the nuclear point source becomes increasingly dominant as one considers harder and harder bands ) . ] .",
    "as we will see , this is completely in line with our spectral analysis .",
    "we now present an analysis of the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn spectrum of cygnus  a. a spatially resolved investigation of the interaction of the radio lobes with the icm using these data has been presented previously by @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the study presented here is the first published analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ view of the cygnus  a nucleus itself . based on previous works @xcite , we expect the x - ray spectrum within our extraction radius to be the superposition of thermal emission from the optically thin plasma of the icm and a heavily absorbed agn spectrum ( all absorbed by a galactic column of @xmath23 ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we will see , the epic - pn derived constraints on the parameters of the agn are rather poor due to the combination of the heavy absorption and the truncation of the epic bandpass at 10kev . however , our main motivation here is to construct an icm model that can be taken over into our _ nustar _ analysis of the agn .",
    "we find that the icm emission is well described by two apec components @xcite with independent temperatures ( @xmath24 ) . driven by physical considerations , we assume that the two icm components have a common metal abundance ( @xmath25 ) . in this paper , all abundances",
    "are referenced to the solar abundance ( @xmath26 ) set described by @xcite . for all spectral models described below , the inclusion of a third temperature icm component fails to give a significant improvement in the goodness of fit .",
    "we begin by approximating the agn emission with a simple power - law ( pl ) continuum absorbed by a neutral / cold absorber at the redshift of cygnus  a ( cabs ) with column density @xmath27 and solar abundances .",
    "both the intrinsic absorber and the galactic absorbing column ( which also affects the icm emission ) are describing using the tbabs code of @xcite .",
    "this model provides a good description of the broad - band spectrum ( model icm+cabs[pl ] in table  [ tab : xmmfits ] ) .",
    "the residuals do indicate , however , a strong unmodeled emission line between 67kev ( rest - frame ) . adding a gaussian emission line ( emline ) into the spectral model leads to a dramatic improvement in the goodness of fit ( @xmath28 for three additional model parameters ) .",
    "the line is narrow ( @xmath29 corresponding to a fwhm@xmath30 ) , relatively strong ( equivalent width @xmath31 ) , and has a centroid energy precisely that expected from the fluorescent k@xmath10 line of cold iron ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this model ( icm+cabs[pl+emline ] ) leaves no gross residuals in the fit .    in their _ chandra _",
    "study of cygnus  a , @xcite find soft power - law emission from a bipolar source spanning the nucleus that they identity as scattered agn emission .",
    "hence , we must explore whether the icm parameters can be skewed by the addition of such a scattered component . adding a power - law component that is not obscured by the agn absorber with a photon index that is tied to that of the main agn continuum but with a normalization decreased by a factor of 100 @xcite has essentially no impact on the fit or the icm parameters . allowing the normalization to be free results in a small and insignificant improvement in the goodness of fit ( @xmath33 for 2 additional degrees of freedom ) and a best fitting icm abundance of @xmath34 .",
    "however , the normalization of this scattered component is then 25% of the primary continuum  this is 25@xmath35 higher than found by _",
    "chandra _ , strongly suggesting that we should reject this possibility .",
    "we conclude that soft / scattered emission from the agn does not strongly bias our icm model .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "_ nustar _ has given us the cleanest view yet of the nuclear hard x - ray emission of cygnus  a. the source - dominated spectrum across the 370kev band permits us to detect spectral curvature consistent with compton scattering from cold , compton - thick ( or near compton - thick ) material that may be identifiable with the outer regions of the accretion disk or a high column density `` core '' of the obscuring torus of unified agn schemes . in the spectral modeling presented above , the compton scattering and associated iron fluorescence was described using the xillver model of @xcite  we stress that , while it is usually employed to describe reflection from accretion disks , we are using xillver in the spirit of a generic , self - consistent , and accurate model of x - ray reflection from compton - thick matter .",
    "another view of the compton scattered component can be gained by using the mytorus model of @xcite .",
    "while possessing less up - to - date atomic physics data and a simpler ( non self - consistent ) ionization structure , this model allows us to explore scattering / reflecting distributions that are not completely compton - thick . replacing the xillver component with the scattering and iron line emission described by mytorus in our ultimate , best - fitting two - zone ionized wind model , we find that the fit is comparably good , with the column density of the scatterer constrained to be @xmath36 ( 0.7 - 2.0 compton - depths ) at 90% confidence , and @xmath37 ( 0.5 - 2.8 compton - depths ) at 99% confidence",
    ". taken at face value , this suggests that the scattering / reflecting matter is only mildly compton - thick . confirming our previous expectations , the scattering / reflecting column density is substantially more than that seen in ( cold ) absorption , demonstrating that the scattering matter must be out of the line of sight .",
    "we use our best fitting ( wind@xmath38reflection ) model to derive intrinsic agn luminosities , correcting for the contribution from the icm and de - absorbing .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : fluxesandlums ] .",
    "the 210kev x - ray luminosity is @xmath39 , almost 10% of the bolometric luminosity as calculated by @xcite on the basis of the radio - to - ir sed . unless the ir - calorimetry assumption underlying the @xcite work fails due to some unusual geometry ,",
    "we conclude that cygnus  a is x - ray loud , with a 2 - 10kev bolometric correction of only 10 .",
    "however , given the fact that cygnus  a likely has an eddington ratio of only @xmath40 , this behavior falls in line with that found in other broad - line agn @xcite .",
    "our most novel finding in the _ nustar _ spectrum is the presence of subtle features indicative of a high - column density ( @xmath41 ) , highly ionized , ( @xmath42 ) , fast ( @xmath43 ) wind .",
    "the fact that we see possible red - shifted emission from this wind suggests that it is a wide - angle outflow , subtending a significant solid - angle of the sky as seen from the central x - ray source . here , we discuss the inferred physical properties of this wind .",
    "suppose that the wind signatures originate from clouds with characteristic hydrogen number density @xmath44 and volume filling factor @xmath45 at a characteristic radius @xmath46 .",
    "the observed column density is @xmath47 and the ionization parameter is @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the ionizing luminosity of the central source ) .",
    "the mass flux is the wind is then given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the solid angle subtended by the wind as viewed from the center of the system , @xmath52 is the velocity of the wind , and @xmath53 is the average particle mass of the wind per proton ( in units of the proton mass @xmath54 ) .",
    "we now make the assumption that the wind is flowing at its local escape velocity so that the characteristic radius is @xmath55 with this , we can write useful expressions for the mass flux @xmath56 scalar momentum flux ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 and kinetic energy flux ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 of the wind .    putting our lower limit on column density @xmath61 into eqn .  [ eq : mtm ] gives @xmath62 where we have used a black hole mass of @xmath63 and assumed that the wind covers a solid angle of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the momentum flux in the wind exceeds the photon momentum flux by an order of magnitude . including the information on the wind velocity",
    "also gives us lower bounds on the mass and energy flux ( using eqns .",
    "[ eq : massflux ] and [ eq : energyflux ] ) , @xmath65 we can immediately see that the mass flux in the wind exceeds the accretion rate onto the black hole unless the radiative efficiency is @xmath66 , and that the energy flux is at least 42% of the bolometric luminosity . these bounds are based on the assumption that the observed wind velocity is the local escape velocity ( thereby allowing us to localize the wind in radius ) . if , instead , we made the weaker assumption that the wind is moving at _ no less than _ its local escape velocity , the momentum , mass and energy fluxes further increase .    given these lower limits on wind fluxes , we can make some comment about acceleration mechanisms . for radiative - driving , the fact that @xmath67 would require acceleration of a very compton - thick wind , @xmath68 , that completely surrounds the radiation source @xcite . while not ruled out by these data , this would require a revision of our basic picture for the central engine structure of agn .",
    "magneto - centrifugal acceleration is possible provided that the inward mass flux in the accretion disk exceeds the mass flux in the wind ( in order for the disk to generate sufficient torque to generate the wind ) . to make this compatible with our measured limits on the mass flux requires a low accretion efficiency , @xmath69 , as might be expected for these low eddington ratios due to the formation of an optically - thin advective accretion flow .",
    "if cygnus  a does indeed possess an advective accretion flow , we also expect some contribution to the wind acceleration to come from thermal driving @xcite .",
    "of course , cygnus  a also possesses very powerful relativistic jets . using the dynamics of the radio cocoon , @xcite estimate a total jet power in the range @xmath70",
    "; this exceeds the radiative luminosity by a factor of 210 . whatever process drives these relativistic jets , whether it be accretion @xcite or black hole spin @xcite ,",
    "we need only channel @xmath71 of the power into a wide - angle sub - relativistic outflow in order to explain the observed wind .",
    "a large body of prior work has identified two distinct modes of agn feedback @xcite .",
    "relativistic radio - jets from agn in massive ellipticals and the brightest cluster galaxies in cooling core clusters appear to provide `` maintenance mode '' feedback , preventing a cooling catastrophe in their hot atmospheres @xcite . on the other hand , powerful sub - relativistic winds from luminous quasars",
    "can sweep molecular gas out of a galaxy and quench star formation following a major merger @xcite .",
    "these are normally considered to be mutually exclusive forms of feedback .",
    "this notion is partially motivated by drawing an analogy between agn and stellar mass black hole x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) in which the mutually exclusive occurrence of disk winds and relativistic jets is quite well established @xcite .",
    "cygnus  a appears to break this mold .",
    "we clearly see powerful jets interacting with the icm of the cooling core cluster .",
    "however , we now also see a powerful and wide - angle sub - relativistic wind with sufficient energy and momentum to significantly impact the host galaxy @xcite",
    ". we should not be too surprised that some breakdown in the agn - bhb analogy exists .",
    "important aspects of the accretion physics do _ not _ remain invariant as we scale the mass up from a stellar - mass to a supermassive object .",
    "agn accretion disks are significantly more radiation - pressure dominated than their bhb cousins , raising the possibility that their stability properties are different . additionally , being cooler , agn disks have much higher opacities at their photospheres raising the possibility of line - driven winds @xcite .",
    "line - driving may prime the fast wind that we see , lofting material off the surface of the disk where it can be strongly photo - ionized by the central x - ray source and magneto - centrifugally accelerated .",
