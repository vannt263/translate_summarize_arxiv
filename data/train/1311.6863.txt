    "a pairwise comparison matrix @xmath6 is called _ consistent _ ( or _ transitive _ ) if : @xmath14 for every @xmath15 .",

    "if the consistency condition does not hold , the matrix is _ inconsistent _ ( or _ intransitive _ ) .",
    "axiomatization of inconsistency indicators for pairwise comparisons has been recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the challenge for the pairwise comparisons method comes from the lack of consistency of the pairwise comparisons matrices , which arises in practice ( while as a rule , all the pairwise comparisons matrices are reciprocal ) .",

    "such type of matrices are examined in @xcite as `` error - free '' matrices .",
    "it is unfortunate that the singular form `` comparison '' is sometimes used considering that a minimum of three comparisons are needed for the method to have a practical meaning .",
