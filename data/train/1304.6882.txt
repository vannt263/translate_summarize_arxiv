    "self - similarity is a possible feature of multi - partons inside a proton at small _ x _ suggested by lastovicka @xcite and pursued by us later @xcite . we use momentum sum rule @xcite to compute the fractions of momentum carried by quarks and gluons in such a model .",
    "as this sum rule needs information about _ x _ in the regime @xmath0 , we extrapolate the validity of the model beyond its original range @xmath1 . in section 2 ,",
    "we outline the formalism and in section 3 , we discuss the results .",
    "the model is described by self - similarity based parton density functions ( pdfs ) in ref . [ 1 ] : @xmath2 where the parameters are @xmath3 i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the only flavor dependent parameter and @xmath6 is the flavor independent function for describing _ x _ and @xmath7 dependence of the pdf . + defining structure function @xmath8 we get @xmath9\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the momentum sum rule @xcite is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the momentum fractions carried by quarks and gluons respectively .",
    "+ using eq ( 3 ) in eq ( 10 ) , @xmath16 where @xmath17 note that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not identical except in specific model @xcite , where partons have integral charges .",
    "hence the momentum sum rule as given in eq ( 9 ) becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21 which has to be determined from data .",
    "+   + since @xmath22 is negative and @xmath23 is positive ( eq ( 2 ) ) , there exists a singularity in _ x _ at @xmath24 in the structure function @xmath25 ( eq ( 6 ) ) . any viable structure function",
    "is not expected to have such a singularity in the region @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore evaluate the integral of eq ( 14 ) by cauchy s principle value integration @xcite leading to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an infinite series .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 here @xmath30 is introduced to take care of the end - point singularity @xmath31 in the model . taking only the first term of the integral @xmath32",
    ", we have @xmath33",
    "in order to make numerical analysis , we have to determine _ a _ and @xmath30 defined in eq ( 15 ) and eq ( 19 ) respectively . we take @xmath34 at @xmath35 @xcite and evaluate @xmath36 using it in eq ( 19 ) , we obtain @xmath37 in table 1 , we record the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 for several representative values of @xmath7 . we also show the values with @xmath40 corresponding to partons having integral charges @xmath41 in order to explicitly show the effects of charges in the partition of momentum among quarks and gluons in the model",
    ".    .*values of @xmath42 and @xmath39 for a few representative values of @xmath7 . *",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + this table shows that only for @xmath43 .",
    "+ in the present model , on the other hand , such feature sets in even at much lower @xmath44 range as discussed earlier .",
    "the study of flavor dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the present model is not possible as it is absorbed in the model parameter @xmath47 ( eq ( 8) ) .",
    "the effects of large _ x _ and higher order terms are currently under study . + it is also interesting to note that the asymptotic partitions of quark and gluon momenta of eq ( 23 ) and eq ( 24 ) have been questioned in recent literature @xcite .",
    "the suggested alternative asymptotic partition is @xmath48 @xmath49 leading to @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively even asymptotically . in the present model such specific partitions set in at finite @xmath44 .",
    "thus the main feature of the self - similarity based present analysis , i.e. @xmath54 with increased @xmath44 might conform to the qcd expectation as well if the result of ref . [",
    "15 ] is taken seriously .",
    "+ the model , even though predicts such interesting results , has several deficiencies of its own .",
    "first , the model has phenomenological validity only in a limited @xmath55-range .",
    "second , the model falls short of accommodating momentum sum rule for large @xmath44 , @xmath56 . finally ,",
    "as it is purely self - similarity inspired , the model does not conform to standard dglap evolution .",
    "in this paper , we have used momentum sum rule to compute the fractions of momentum carried by quarks and gluons in a self - similarity based model of proton .",
    "the main feature of the present analysis is that the momentum fraction of quarks increases with @xmath44 , while the corresponding fraction of gluons decreases .",
    "this prediction conforms to asymptotic qcd expectations , as reported recently @xcite .",
    "the difference is that such momentum partitions set in at finite @xmath44 in the present model .",
