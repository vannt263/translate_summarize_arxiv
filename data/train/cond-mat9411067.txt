    "in his 1909 paper on gas flow through a capillary , knudsen demonstrated that the ratio between the pressure drop over the capillary and the gas - flow rate first increases and then decreases with increasing density.@xcite the mechanism is that with increasing density of gas particles , the number of interparticle collisions increases . at low densities ( what is now known as the knudsen transport regime ) the gas particles move almost independently , so that the flow is mainly carried by particles with a large velocity parallel to the wire axis .",
    "these particles travel long distances before colliding with the wall .",
    "an occasional interparticle collision , although not resistive by itself because of momentum conservation , drives the parallel - moving particles towards the wall and shortens their trajectories between subsequent collisions with the wall .",
    "therefore , in this regime , an enhancement of the interparticle collision - rate leads to increasing dissipation of forward particle momentum at the capillary walls . at higher densities , however , many interparticle collisions between subsequent particle - wall collisions occur , resulting in a random - walk behavior . as a consequence",
    "a laminar ( poiseuille ) flow evolves , in which the effective particle - wall interaction is decreased .    because of the analogy between classical diffusive transport of electrons and gas particles , one anticipates that a similar transition between knudsen and poiseuille flow may occur in electron transport . in this case",
    "electron - electron ( e - e ) scattering events are the analogue of collisions between gas particles.@xcite electron - electron scattering@xcite has no influence on the electrical resistivity of bulk materials , because it conserves the total momentum of the electron distribution .",
    "effects of e - e scattering in the classical transport regime can only be expected in the resistivity of films and wires of high purity and small dimensions,@xcite where conditions similar to those leading to hydrodynamic gas flow can be realized .",
    "typically , the sample width @xmath0 should be smaller than or comparable to the impurity mean free path @xmath1 of the bulk material .",
    "these two lengths should be compared to @xmath2 , the average length an electron covers between two subsequent e - e scattering events .",
    "when @xmath3 one expects an increase of the resistivity with increasing e - e scattering rate , which is the electronic knudsen effect .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath4 the resistivity should decrease with increasing e - e scattering rate , due to electronic poiseuille flow .",
    "the latter effect has been predicted by gurzhi in 1963 @xcite and is now known as the gurzhi effect .",
    "experimentally , it proved difficult to obtain reliable data on these effects , because dissipation mechanisms not present in gas flow usually prevent the occurrence of electronic knudsen and gurzhi flow regimes : first of all , electrons in a metal are scattered by impurities . moreover , since the e - e scattering rate is usually varied by changing the lattice temperature of the sample , the induced effects are overwhelmed by electron - phonon interactions .",
    "furthermore , an increase in temperature also enhances the _ umklapp _ electron - electron scattering rate , which adds to the bulk resistivity .",
    "finally , deviations from an ideal spherical fermi surface may hinder interpretation of experimental data .    due to these complications",
    ", only a few experimental indications of e - e scattering effects have been found.@xcite most experiments use potassium , as an exemplary simple metal , which to a good approximation has a spherical fermi surface.@xcite however , the observed changes in the resistivity as a function of lattice temperature are limited to about 0.01% of the total resistivity , because of the small @xmath1 and the onset of electron - phonon scattering .",
    "_ @xcite have reported a negative temperature derivative of the resistivity ( @xmath5 ) of potassium wires at temperatures around and below 1 k. however , an interpretation in terms of the gurzhi effect was disputed,@xcite since at these temperatures @xmath3 . in later publications of the same group , it was shown that the negative @xmath6 can be attributed to metallurgical imperfections,@xcite and also kondo - like effects in the resistivity were reported.@xcite observations of a positive @xmath7 in wider wires @xcite were interpreted by movshovitz and wiser @xcite as a knudsen - like behavior due to the combination of e - e and electron - phonon collisions .",
    "a similar mechanism was proposed to explain an anomalously strong , positive @xmath6 in very thin potassium films.@xcite however , until now there has been no observation of electronic poiseuille flow , nor has there been an observation of a ` knudsen maximum ' in the resistance@xcite at the crossover between knudsen and gurzhi flow regimes .    in this paper",
    ", we present an experimental and theoretical study of knudsen and gurzhi transport phenomena in two - dimensional wires .",
    "the wires used for the experiments are defined electrostatically in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) of ( al , ga)as heterostructures . using these devices to study hydrodynamic electron - flow offers several advantages : first",
    ", due to the high purity of the material and the resolution of electron - beam lithography one can easily reach the condition @xmath8 .",
    "second , _ umklapp _ electron - electron scattering is absent , because of the low electron density and the perfectly circular fermi surface .",
    "third , the electron - acoustic phonon coupling is weak in the ( al , ga)as-2deg system .",
    "this makes it possible to investigate the influence of e - e scattering _ not _ by changing the temperature @xmath9 of the full sample , but by selectively changing the temperature @xmath10 of the electrons inside the wire by passing a dc current @xmath11 through the device .",
    "previously , this current - heating technique has proven very useful for the study of thermoelectric phenomena in nanostructures.@xcite the wires studied here are equipped with opposing pairs of quantum point - contacts in their boundaries . since the thermopower of the point contacts is quantized,@xcite we can determine the electron temperature @xmath10 in the wire , as a function of @xmath11 , from a thermovoltage measurement.@xcite the ability to modify selectively the e - e scattering rate allows a clear and unambiguous demonstration of hydrodynamic effects on the resistance of the wire .",
    "we measure in the experiments the differential resistance @xmath12 versus @xmath11.@xcite in the resistance curves we can distinguish three regimes : 1 ) starting from @xmath13 we observe an increase in @xmath12 with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "this is attributed to the knudsen effect .",
    "we find resistance changes as large as 10% of the total resistance .",
    "2 ) then there is a range where @xmath12 decreases with increasing @xmath11 , which we identify as the gurzhi effect . in this range , we see relative resistance changes up to 20% .",
    "3 ) upon increasing @xmath11 we come into a regime where @xmath12 increases again . here",
    ", the heating due to the applied current also affects the lattice temperature , so that the resistance increase can be attributed to enhanced electron - phonon scattering . at the crossover between regime 1 ) and 2 ) the knudsen maximum is reached .",
    "the minimum in the resistance between regime 2 ) and 3 ) was the actual subject of one of gurzhi s first papers.@xcite    in order to understand our experimental results , we have developed a theory based on the boltzmann transport equation , which yields quantitative agreement with the experiments . in the first half of this century",
    "the boltzmann approach has been applied to study size effects on the resistance of small conductors .",
    "the thin film case has been addressed by fuchs @xcite and the case of a thin wire by dingle.@xcite a particularly insightful method to solve the boltzmann equation is due to chambers,@xcite who has expressed the solution in terms of the effective mean free path the electron covers between either bulk - impurity or boundary collisions .",
    "these treatments consider partially diffusive boundary scattering , in which part of the electrons colliding with the boundaries is specularly reflected and the remainder is diffusely scattered .",
    "the boundary scattering is modeled by a constant specularity coefficient . in a more realistic treatment by soffer @xcite the wave nature of the electrons",
    "has been taken into account and results in a specularity coefficient which depends on the angle of incidence . in ref .",
    "it is shown that inclusion of the angle - dependent specularity coefficient in a calculation of the resistivity of thin wires gives a more satisfactory agreement with experiments than dingle s original theory .",
    "the inclusion of e - e scattering in the boltzmann approach to the resistivity of wires is not trivial and has been limited to a certain parameter range in most treatments .",
    "in the pioneering work by gurzhi,@xcite the situation @xmath14 is considered .",
    "it is shown that under these conditions the boltzmann equation can be mapped on a navier - stokes type of equation .",
    "the opposite knudsen regime @xmath15 has been treated by movshovitz and wiser,@xcite who use the chambers method to calculate effective mean free paths with the approximation that at most one e - e scattering event in each electron trajectory is taken into account . in ref .",
    "gurzhi and coworkers provide an alternative approach for this regime , by solving the boltzmann equation perturbatively .",
    "this also allows including specific features of the e - e scattering , such as the distinction between isotropic and small - angle scattering .",
    "we know of only two approaches that describe the resistivity of wires from the knudsen up to the gurzhi regime .",
    "the first is due to black,@xcite who employs a monte carlo technique to calculate effective mean free paths in a wire .",
    "although the numerical results are not so accurate because of the limited computer power available at the time , the knudsen maximum in the resistivity is found .",
    "the results show similar behavior for isotropic and small - angle e - e scattering .",
    "the second approach is due to de gennaro and rettori.@xcite they start from the boltzmann equation and include e - e scattering by a scattering term due to callaway @xcite in which the electrons are relaxed towards a distribution with a net drift velocity . as pointed out by gurzhi _",
    "et al._,@xcite the final results of ref .",
    "are incorrect , because the spatial variation of the drift velocity is neglected .",
    "our theoretical description starts from a kinetic equation similar to that of ref .  .",
    "we have obtained a self - consistent solution of the relevant boltzmann equation .",
    "this is the first theory which provides an analytical expression for the boltzmann distribution function for _ any _ set of @xmath16 .",
    "it will prove insightful to express the boltzmann distribution function in terms of an effective mean free path .",
    "for the regime @xmath17 our solution is equivalent to the results of movshovitz and wiser , so that we have provided a formal basis for their method of including e - e scattering events in the electron trajectories .",
    "our approach is indeed able to describe the transition from knudsen to poiseuille flow .",
    "the transition can be illustrated by the evolution of the electron - flow profiles along the wire .    in the three - dimensional case , which has been addressed in most previous treatments ,",
    "the e - e scattering rate of electrons in a thermal slice around the fermi surface is proportional to @xmath18 , as follows from the well - known phase space argument.@xcite for a 2deg , instead , the e - e scattering rate is proportional to @xmath19.@xcite in a study by laikhtman @xcite of relaxation of injected electrons into a zero - temperature 2deg it is found that small - angle scattering is important .",
    "features of e - e scattering in a 2deg are also discussed by gurzhi and coworkers.@xcite the e - e scattering term which we use is first proposed by callaway@xcite and is not of a microscopic origin , but takes the main feature of e - e scattering , conservation of momentum , into account .",
    "as we will show , an attractive feature of this simplified scattering term is that it allows an exact ( numerical ) solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "we have compared experiment with theory through a three step procedure : first , using the results of the point - contact thermometry we find @xmath10 versus @xmath11 .",
    "then , using a formula due to giuliani and quinn@xcite we calculate @xmath2 as a function of @xmath10 . finally , we determine the wire resistivity for the given @xmath2 from our boltzmann approach .",
    "this has yielded quite a satisfactory agreement for both the knudsen and the gurzhi regime .",
    "the regime 3 ) in which phonon scattering due to the heating of the lattice increases the resistivity is outside the range of our theory . from the magnitude of the knudsen effect we obtain information on the boundary - scattering parameters of the gate - defined wires .",
    "a brief account of this work with an emphasis on the experiments has already been published.@xcite here , we present a more extensive discussion .",
    "particular attention is paid to the derivation of the theoretical model and how its results can be compared with the experiments .",

    "our devices are fabricated from two different ( al , ga)as heterostructures containing a high - mobility 2deg , grown at philips research laboratories , redhill , surrey , uk .",
    "the wires used in the experiments are created by electrostatic confinement of the 2deg using a split gate technique . on top of the heterostructures , which are mesa - etched in the shape of a hall bar",
    ", a pattern of tiau gates is defined using electron - beam lithography . the lay - out of the tiau gates",
    "is given schematically in the inset of fig .",
    "the wires have a lithographic width @xmath20 m ( note that due to electrostatic depletion the width @xmath0 of the wires in the 2deg is somewhat smaller ) , and a length @xmath21 that varies between 20 and 120 @xmath22 m .",
    "a quantum point - contact is incorporated in each wire boundary .",
    "we report here on three different types of samples , whose particulars as to @xmath21 , @xmath0 , electron density @xmath23 and mean free path @xmath1 are summarized in table [ t1 ] . for transport measurements ,",
    "the samples are kept in a cryostat at temperatures of 1.5 k and above , and at zero magnetic field . for reasons of sensitivity",
    ", we measure the differential resistance of point contacts and wires with standard low - frequency lock - in techniques , using a 100 @xmath22v ac voltage .",
    "all measurements are performed in a four - terminal geometry .    in order to adjust the electron temperature in the wires",
    ", a dc heating current @xmath24 ( typically an order of magnitude larger than the ac measuring current ) is passed through the wire using ohmic contacts 1 and 5 . because of power dissipation , the average kinetic energy of the electrons in the wire increases .",
    "due to frequent e - e scattering events , the electron distribution - function in the wire thermalizes rapidly to a heated fermi function at a temperature @xmath10 , above the lattice temperature @xmath9 .",
    "this increased electron temperature can be measured using the quantum - point contacts in the wire boundaries : since the electrons in the regions outside the wire remain at the same temperature as the lattice , a thermovoltage builds up across both point contacts ab and cd , which can be measured as a transverse voltage @xmath25 . note that @xmath26 does not contain a contribution from the voltage drop along the wire , since point contacts ab and cd face each other .",
    "we thus have @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the thermopower of point contact ab(cd ) .    like the electrical conductance",
    ", the thermopower @xmath29 of a quantum point - contact exhibits a pronounced quantum size - effect:@xcite while the electrical conductance of the point contact varies stepwise with the voltage on the split - gates , the thermopower oscillates .",
    "the external gate voltage controls the number of one - dimensional subbands present below the fermi energy in the point contact .",
    "when the fermi energy inside the point contact falls in between two subbands , the conductance is quantized , and the thermopower @xmath30",
    ". however , when the fermi energy inside the point contact exactly coincides with the bottom of the @xmath31-th subband , the conductance is in between the @xmath31-th and the @xmath32-th plateau , and the thermopower attains a maximum value , which for a step - function transmission probability of the point contact , is given by@xcite @xmath33 if @xmath34 . the quantum oscillations in the thermopower of a quantum point - contact",
    "were predicted by streda,@xcite and an experimental demonstration of the effect has been reported elsewhere.@xcite here , we utilize the effect to measure the electron temperature in the wire : we adjust point contact cd on a conductance plateau , thus setting @xmath35 , and adjust point contact ab for maximum thermopower [ @xmath36 , where @xmath37v / k ] .",
    "the result of such a measurement of @xmath26 as a function of dc heating current @xmath11 , obtained for a wire of type i , is shown in fig .",

    "a very similar behavior is found . in general",

    "evidently , such a quadratic dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath11 is exactly what one expects to a first approximation for joule dissipation . for @xmath44a ,",
    "the situation is more complicated since at these current levels also the lattice temperature starts to increase .",

    "a strongly non - monotonic behavior of @xmath12 is evident for all traces .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior in the differential resistance is the focus of this paper and we will show that it results from electronic knudsen and poiseuille flow .",
    "a first remark we should make here is that in the high - mobility 2deg quantum corrections to the resistance such as weak localization are not measurable at the temperatures involved .",

    "the existence of these transport regimes has already been anticipated in the 1960s.@xcite although some aspects of hydrodynamic electron flow have been observed in potassium wires,@xcite it is the high - mobility obtained in ( al , ga)as heterostructures in combination with nano - lithography techniques that has made the observation of the complete transition from the knudsen to the gurzhi flow regime accessible .",
    "the current - heating technique appears to be an essential tool , by which the e - e scattering rate can be varied , while keeping the other types of scattering unaltered .",
    "due to the point - contact thermometry we are able to determine the electron temperature inside the wire as a function of the current . although hydrodynamic electron flow has been predicted many years ago , its actual observation in our devices and the sheer size of the effects is quite astonishing .",
    "we have developed a theory based on the boltzmann transport equation .",

    "first , we assume isotropic impurity scattering instead of the small - angle scattering known to occur in a 2deg .",
    "second , we apply a simple e - e scattering term due to callaway,@xcite which only takes into account the conservation of the total momentum . at this moment , we do not see a method of solution of the boltzmann equation with on the one hand more realistic scattering terms , and which is on the other hand applicable to the complete transport regime .",
    "however , our method already shows how complex the flow behavior becomes due to the combination of resistive impurity scattering as well as partly diffusive boundary scattering and non - resistive e - e scattering .",
    "a quantitative comparison between experiment and the boltzmann theory can be made , since the electron temperature and thus the e - e scattering length inside the wire can be inferred from experiment .",
    "the obtained agreement is quite good .",
    "this proves that in spite of its simplifications our boltzmann theory contains the essential physical ingredients to describe the experiments .",
    "our results show that the soffer model@xcite for angle - dependent boundary scattering is more appropriate to describe the scattering with the gate - defined wire boundaries than a constant specularity coefficient .",
    "apart from the determination of the specularity parameter , our comparison is only based on experimental data and contains no fitting .",
    "it would be of interest to perform further experiments on hydrodynamic electron flow .",

    "<S> hydrodynamic electron flow is experimentally observed in the differential resistance of electrostatically defined wires in the two - dimensional electron gas in ( al , ga)as heterostructures . in these experiments </S>",
    "<S> current heating is used to induce a controlled increase in the number of electron - electron collisions in the wire . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between the partly diffusive wire - boundary scattering and the electron - electron scattering leads first to an increase and then to a decrease of the resistance of the wire with increasing current . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are the electronic analog of knudsen and poiseuille flow in gas transport , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the electron flow is studied theoretically through a boltzmann transport equation , which includes impurity , electron - electron , and boundary scattering . </S>",
    "<S> a solution is obtained for arbitrary scattering parameters . by calculation of flow profiles inside the wire </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated how normal flow evolves into poiseuille flow . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary - scattering parameters for the gate - defined wires can be deduced from the magnitude of the knudsen effect . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement between experiment and theory is obtained . </S>"
