    "in this paper we study the structure of the kauffman bracket skein algebra of an oriented punctured surface at a @xmath1-th root of unity where @xmath2 is odd .",

    "given an orientable surface @xmath4 its kauffman bracket skein algebra @xmath5 is formed by taking linear combinations of framed links in a cylinder over the surface , @xmath6 , with complex coefficients , and modding out by the relations that define the kauffman bracket link invariant .",
    "the multiplication comes from stacking one link above the other , with the up and down direction given by the interval @xmath7 .",

    "the primary application of our criterion for detecting a local basis is the construction of a splitting of a localization of the skein algebra as a tensor product of two commutative subalgebras over its center .",

    "notice that the determinant of the @xmath430 block in the upper left hand corner is @xmath369 .",
    "since we are working modulo @xmath2 where @xmath2 is odd , this is a unit , and the first five rows form a basis for the subspace of @xmath431 that only has non - zero entries in the first @xmath342 coordinates .",
    "we can add combinations of the first five rows to clear out the non - zero entries in first five columns of all the lower rows of the whole matrix .",
    "this means that in the next part of the argument we can concentrate solely on the entries in columns @xmath322 and up .",
    "consider the block of the modified matrix starting at row @xmath322 and column 6 and going across to column 17 and down to row 17 . in our example , the @xmath432-th through @xmath376-st columns ( labeled as @xmath433 ) are all zeroes in this range .",
    "however in the case that the genus of the surface is greater than @xmath345 the rows @xmath434 , @xmath435 and @xmath436 will have @xmath185 s in the @xmath432-th column .",
    "this does not change anything since the linear combinations we take cancel in the @xmath432-th column . @xmath437    our goal is to use row operations to have this matrix equal to the result of appending a column that has all but one entry equal to @xmath100 to the left hand side of the matrix ( [ matr4 ] ) , thus creating an iterative procedure .",
    "the first step is to subtract @xmath419 from @xmath435 , and @xmath421 from @xmath436 .",
    "this echoes subtracting row @xmath412 from row @xmath419 , and row @xmath420 from @xmath421 in the matrix ( [ matr2 ] ) .",
    "note that the column @xmath414 has @xmath185 in row @xmath445 and zeroes in all other rows .",
    "the matrix ( [ matr8 ] ) coincides with appending this column on the left to matrix ( [ matr4 ] ) as desired .",
    "we now proceed as before .",
    "thus for a surface of genus @xmath345 the determinant of ( [ matr ] ) equals @xmath447 .",
    "the procedure can be repeated as many times as needed in the general case , when the matrix corresponds to a surface of larger genus @xmath30 , on the rest of the blocks corresponding to middle handles . in general for a surface of genus @xmath30 with one puncture the determinant is equal to @xmath372 .    since @xmath185 is relatively prime to all odd numbers , the matrix of resides mod @xmath2 is invertible .",
    "that implies that the residues of the curves @xmath448 are a basis for @xmath21 , and we can apply theorem [ basecase ] .",
    "this concludes the proof for surfaces of genus @xmath449 with one puncture .    if the surface has more than one puncture we put all the additional punctures on the bottom handle .",
    "we slice the bottom handle horizontally into pieces .",
    "we continue to build modularly , so if the surface has genus @xmath30 we have one top handle , @xmath328 middle handles , one bottom handle , and then a planar surface .",
    "the planar surface is decomposed into a family of annuli with a point ( a puncture ) removed from each boundary component , and a disc with one point removed from its boundary and one from its interior .",
    "the bottom handle is triangulated in the same way as the middle handles .",
    "the planar surface is triangulated as a union of triangulations of the annuli and the punctured disk .",
    "the annuli are triangulated with two interior edges , which we denote by @xmath450 and @xmath451 along with the edges in their boundary curves , denoted @xmath452 and @xmath453 .",
    "the punctured disk is triangulated by one folded triangle with a folded edge denoted @xmath454 and the boundary edge @xmath455 .",
    "the triangulation of an annular piece is shown in figure [ annulus ] , and the triangulated punctured disk is pictured in figure [ disk ] .        we need to add more curves to the families @xmath33 and @xmath34 in order to have pants decompositions of a multiply punctured surface .",
    "we add one curve to each family for each additional puncture . for a surface",
    "@xmath4 of genus @xmath457 with one puncture we have @xmath458 and @xmath459 as described above and shown in figures [ p3 ] and [ q3 ] for a surface of genus @xmath3 . for @xmath31 punctures",
    "we add @xmath460 additional curves to each family .",
    "the curves @xmath461 added to the family @xmath33 can be described as follows .",
    "curve @xmath462 is a parallel copy of the curve @xmath327 slid across the last puncture so that it does not intersect any other curves in family @xmath33 .",
    "curves @xmath463 are a nested family that surround an increasing number of punctures , with @xmath464 containing @xmath185 punctures , and @xmath465 containing all but the last puncture .",
    "one can think of curves @xmath466 as parallel copies of the curve @xmath363 around the original puncture , slid across the subsequent punctures .",
    "figure [ ppunct ] shows the parts of those curves lying in the bottom handle and in the planar surface , for a surface with @xmath345 punctures .",
    "we also add curves @xmath468 to the family @xmath34 .",
    "the curve @xmath469 is a parallel copy of the curve @xmath341 slid across the first puncture .",
    "curves @xmath470 are a nested family surrounding a decreasing number of punctures , starting with all the additional @xmath460 punctures , all the way down to only containing the last two punctures .",
    "all the @xmath471 curves lie in the planar surface , and are shown in figure [ qpunct ] for a surface with @xmath345 punctures .      if there are just two punctures the argument is a simple extension of what has already been done , so we focus on the case where there are at least three punctures .",
    "the proof is similar to the one for a surface with one puncture .",
    "we calculate the determinant of a matrix whose entries are the geometric intersection numbers of the curves @xmath474 with the edges of the triangulation .",
    "it turns out that this is again a power of @xmath185 .",
    "this implies that the change of basis matrix from the standard basis for @xmath312 to the basis consisting of the residues of the admissible colorings corresponding to curves @xmath474 is invertible .",
    "the size of the matrix for a surface of genus @xmath30 with @xmath31 punctures is @xmath475 .",
    "we divide the matrix into blocks corresponding to the handles from top down as we did for a surface with one puncture .",
    "we have @xmath322 columns for the bottom handle , and @xmath476 columns for the planar surface .",
    "since the bottom handle looks now like a middle handle , its block of columns consists of edges @xmath477 , rather than just @xmath403 .",
    "the subsequent columns correspond to the edges triangulating the annular regions from top down : @xmath478, ... ,@xmath479 and finally the folded edge @xmath456 .",
    "the rows corresponding to the bottom handle are ordered as follows : @xmath326 , @xmath338 , @xmath327 , followed by the rows corresponding to the new vectors @xmath469 , @xmath462 and the curve surrounding the top puncture @xmath363 .",
    "we group the two families of additional nested curves surrounding the increasing numbers of punctures with the single curves surrounding the additional punctures in one block : @xmath470 , @xmath480 , and @xmath481 .",
    "notice that the curves in the top @xmath328 blocks corresponding to the top @xmath328 handles do not intersect any of the edges starting with @xmath482 thus their entries in the last @xmath483 columns are all @xmath100 .",
    "recall also that the elementary row operations that reduced that part of the matrix to the triangular block form did not involve any rows corresponding to the bottom handle .",
    "thus we can concentrate only on the blocks of rows corresponding to the last two handles and the planar surface : the block of @xmath322 rows for the @xmath325-st handle , the block of @xmath322 rows for the bottom handle and the block of rows corresponding to the @xmath484 and @xmath264 curves .",
    "the block of rows for the @xmath325-st handle is the same as for a surface with @xmath17 puncture , with zeroes filling up the additional columns .",
    "the rows for the bottom handle are as follows : the rows for the @xmath326 and the @xmath338 curves have additional zeroes in the new columns ; the row for the @xmath327 curve has the same pattern as the rows @xmath391 with @xmath485 ; the row for the curve @xmath469 has zeroes in the columns @xmath379 through @xmath398 , then @xmath486 in the columns @xmath487 and zeroes in the remaining columns ; the row for the curve @xmath462 is the same as for the curve @xmath327 up to the column @xmath398 , then has @xmath393 in the columns @xmath488 , and the vector @xmath489 in each sequence of columns @xmath490 , ending with @xmath17 in the column @xmath454 ; the row for the curve @xmath363 surrounding the top puncture has twos in the columns @xmath379 through @xmath338 , @xmath491 in columns @xmath492 and zeroes in the remaining columns .",
    "the rows in the block corresponding to the planar surface are very simple .",
    "the row for the curve @xmath471 has @xmath17 in the columns @xmath493 and @xmath215 , and zeroes in the remaining columns .",
    "the row for the curve @xmath466 has @xmath185 in columns @xmath379 up to @xmath338 , followed by @xmath489 in columns @xmath494 for @xmath495 , ending with @xmath491 in columns @xmath496 and @xmath100 in the subsequent columns , unless @xmath497 , in which case the last entry is in the column @xmath454 and it is equal to @xmath17 .",
    "the row for the curve @xmath264 surrounding the @xmath227-th puncture for @xmath498 has @xmath499 in columns @xmath500 and zeroes in all other columns , row vector for the curve @xmath501 has @xmath502 in the last four columns @xmath503 and zeroes in all preceding columns , finally the row vector @xmath504 for the curve surrounding the bottom puncture has @xmath17 in the column @xmath454 and zeroes in all other columns .    observe that we can perform the same iterative procedures as for the matrix for a surface with @xmath17 puncture to clear all entries up to column @xmath400 for all rows in the blocks corresponding to the last middle handle and to the bottom handle .",
    "we can also use elementary row operations to clear out the twos appearing in columns @xmath505 in row vectors for all the @xmath466 curves , since row vectors for the top @xmath328 handles are linearly independent and have zeroes appearing in columns @xmath506 and higher .",
    "furthermore , we can assume that we performed the necessary elementary row operations so that the rows of the block corresponding to the @xmath325 handle look like the analogous rows of the matrix ( [ blockmatrix ] ) .",
    "we write out the relevant blocks of the matrix for a surface with @xmath345 punctures and use this example to illustrate the general procedure to reduce the matrix to block form . since we are assuming that the row vectors for curves @xmath341 , @xmath330 and @xmath406 have been modified already , we label those @xmath412 , @xmath420 and @xmath507 , counting just the rows appearing on the page .",
    "we are only interested in proving that the determinant of this matrix is @xmath509 for some @xmath222 .",
    "it is clear that if we delete the last row and the last column we will at worst change the sign of the determinant , so we do that to simplify the picture .",
    "we also replace row @xmath462 by @xmath510 and @xmath327 by @xmath511 . using the fact that @xmath512 , and @xmath513 we get the following matrix , where we use the previous convention of renaming the row with its number on the page once it has been changed .",
    "notice that @xmath515 implies that @xmath516 is the vector that has a @xmath185 in the @xmath506 column and zeroes everywhere else .",
    "we subtract this combination from rows @xmath421 and @xmath424 , and also subtract this combination and row @xmath412 from row @xmath363 to get the following matrix .",
    "notice that @xmath424 has a single nonzero entry in column @xmath482 so we can use it to clear the twos in this column from rows @xmath340 , @xmath412 and @xmath420 .",
    "also we can use row @xmath472 to clear out the nonzero entries in rows @xmath469 and @xmath518 in the columns @xmath519 and @xmath520 , so that the resulting matrix ( [ pmatr4 ] ) below is in block lower triangular form .",
    "this means that the determinant of the matrix is the product of the determinants of the blocks on the diagonal .",
    "the blocks corresponding to the top @xmath325 handles have determinant @xmath522 for some @xmath222 .",
    "the determinant of the @xmath30-th block is @xmath523 .",
    "if the surface has @xmath31 punctures then the bottom diagonal block is a @xmath524 matrix consisting of vectors @xmath471 , @xmath466 and @xmath264 , which were described above , starting with their entries in column @xmath519 .",
    "we show this block for @xmath525 , and it is simple to see the general pattern . @xmath526",
    "it is an easy exercise to see that the determinant of this matrix is @xmath527 .",
