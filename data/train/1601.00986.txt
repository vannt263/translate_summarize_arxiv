    "since the 1960s , the density of components on silicon chips has doubled approximately every 18 months , following a trend known as moore s law after intel s cofounder gordon moore , who predicted the phenomenon .",
    "silicon - based transistor manufacturing has now reached the sub-10 nm scale , heralding the limit of moore s law and stimulating the development of alternative switching technologies and host materials for processing and storing bits of information .",
    "quantum bits , or qubits , are at the heart of quantum computing , an entirely different paradigm in which information is encoded using the superposition states of individual quanta . ideally , it is desirable to use single electron transistors ( sets ) or quantum dots ( qds ) to manipulate single - electron spin as building blocks for more complicated computing devices . to reach this goal ,",
    "tremendous efforts have been dedicated to studying the transport properties of qds made from semiconductors , such as gaas and silicon , and , more recently , graphene and other two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials @xcite .",
    "although the high mobility of gaas has enabled the rapid development of spin qubits @xcite , the heavy atomic weights of gallium and arsenide atoms limit the spin relaxation time , making this material less ideal for upscaling .",
    "silicon qds do not suffer from a heavy atomic weight and have shown a sufficiently long spin relaxation time @xcite , but their mobility is limited by their doping mechanism . while research on these materials is ongoing , 2d materials such as graphene , transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) and topological insulators ( tis ) have attracted considerable attention over the past few years because of their novel electronic properties @xcite .",
    "graphene is a robust material for spintronics owing to its weak spin - orbit and hyperfine interactions . over the last decade , attempts to confine and manipulate single charges in graphene quantum dots ( gqds ) have been widely studied and reported , as noted in several review articles @xcite .",
    "however , early studies of gqds on sio@xmath0 have indicated an absence of spin - related phenomena , such as spin blockade and the kondo effect . in order to reduce the substrate disorder , which is one of the major sources of fast spin relaxation ,",
    "recent efforts have been focused on gqds on atomically flat substrates ( e.g. , hexagonal boron nitride [ hbn ] ) .",
    "other 2d materials , such as tmds , exhibit direct band gap in monolayer form and are promising for switch applications due to the high current on / off rates in their transistors . more importantly , the absence of inversion symmetry and the existence of strong spin - orbit coupling in tmds allow the charge carriers to be simultaneously valley- and spin - polarized , providing more degrees of freedom that can be controlled as qubits .",
    "in addition , 3d topological insulators exhibit surface states whose excitations share similarities with dirac fermions in graphene but with real - rather than pseudo - spin locked to the quasimomentum .",
    "these insulators hold promise for dissipationless spintronics and for the operation of quantum devices in the absence of an external magnetic field @xcite . in this review",
    ", we aim to present the theoretical background on this field and provide an overview of experimental studies that are relevant to the development of spin qubits in 2d materials .",
    "we supply the entry - level knowledge for this field by first introducing the fundamental properties of 2d bulk materials followed by the theoretical background relevant to the physics of nanostructures . in the first part of the experimental review , we discuss the transport properties of graphene nanodevices fabricated on both sio@xmath0 and hbn at low temperatures and under high magnetic fields .",
    "our primary focus is the single - electron tunneling regime in transport . in the second part",
    ", we extend our discussion to tmd and ti nanostructures .",
    "we review recent developments in the fabrication and understanding of the electronic properties of these 2d nanostructures , including mos@xmath0 nanoribbons , wse@xmath1 quantum dots , and bi@xmath1se@xmath2 nanowires and quantum dots .",
    "finally , we outline the current challenges in manipulating the spin degree of freedom in graphene - based sets and suggest how future work should pursue the development of spin qubits in 2d materials .      graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms packed tightly in a honeycomb lattice as shown in fig .",

    "when the fermi level is at the dirac point ( see the red dashed line and red rectangle ) , no 1d electronic state exists at zero magnetic field , resulting in the absence of a peak at @xmath541 = 0 ( the remaining weak signal at @xmath541 = 0 is due to the aas contribution ) .",
    "however , when an additional magnetic flux restores the gapped 1d band to the gapless 1d state , an oscillation peak is found at @xmath541 = @xmath64@xmath178/2@xmath408 .",
    "the different natures of the gapped 1d mode ( @xmath541 = 0 ) and the gapless 1d mode ( @xmath541 = @xmath64@xmath178/2@xmath408 ) can be clearly demonstrated by a gate voltage sweep , as shown in fig . [ fig15](f ) . in the case of zero magnetic flux ( @xmath541 = 0 ) , the resistance begins to diverge near the dirac point ( @xmath265= -22 v ) due to the gapped 1d subband .",
    "by contrast , in the case of @xmath541 = @xmath64@xmath178/2@xmath408 , the resistance converges near the dirac point , indicating the fermi level is tuned across the gapless ( helical ) 1d state .",
    "a more detailed study of the gapless state at @xmath541 = @xmath64@xmath178/2@xmath408 has revealed that it is robust against additional impurities but can be easily destroyed under time - reversal symmetry breaking ( i.e. , under perpendicular magnetic fields ) @xcite .",

    "in order to create quantum confinement , parts of the bi@xmath0se@xmath230 nanoribbon were etched ( by n@xmath0 plasma ) into a thin slab to induce a tunnel coupling between top and bottom surfaces , and thus open a band gap .",

    "thus , future experiments are needed to detect spin polarization of charges through ti qds for further applications .",
    "in conclusion , we have provided the theoretical background for and a historical review of a number of electron transport experiments performed on nanostructures fabricated from graphene , transition metal dichalcogenides and topological insulators .",
    "the transport properties of graphene nanodevices ( gnrs , gsqds and gdqds ) fabricated on sio@xmath0 and hbn substrates were both reviewed .",
    "gnrs fabricated on sio@xmath0 and hbn both show the presence of strongly localized states , but in the case of the former , they predominantly originate from substrate disorder , whereas in the latter case , they can be attributed to the edge roughness if the edge - to - bulk ratio is large .",
    "gsqds fabricated on sio@xmath0 and hbn show a distinct difference in their coulomb blockade peak - spacing fluctuations , indicating that edge roughness is the dominant source of disorder for qds with diameters of less than 100 nm .",
    "we have also described the power of pulsed gating for probing electron relaxation times in a gsqd and generating frequency - dependent pumped currents in a gdqd . for tmd nanostructures , despite the rather limited number of experimental studies on transport in such devices , we discussed the fock - darwin spectra of tmd qds for future reference .",
    "finally , we reviewed a few topological insulator nanodevices and discussed their exotic topological surface states .",
    "the discrete 1d subbands of a bi@xmath0se@xmath230 nanowire can be periodically modulated by a magnetic field applied along its length , resulting in a @xmath71 periodicity in its magnetooscillations whose amplitude is tunable by gate voltage .",
    "we also reviewed a bi@xmath0se@xmath230 single quantum dot , in which the single - electron tunneling regime can be manifested .",
    "the absence of spin blockade in gdqds @xcite and the fact that the measured spin relaxation times in 2d graphene flakes are shorter than expected @xcite suggest that there are extrinsic effects that govern the spin relaxation dynamics in graphene .",
    "these effects maybe related to the scattering of electrons off magnetic impurities originating from carbon atom vacancies or graphene edge roughness . since graphene constrictions have been used as tunnel barriers in most gqds reported thus far , alteration of the electron spin by the constriction edge during transport is inevitable .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is to use an electrical - field - induced bandgap in bilayer graphene to define gqds @xcite .",
    "however , the small induced energy gap ( @xmath417 200 mev @xcite ) may limit the available energy range for quantum dot operation . in this sense",
    ", the large bandgaps of few - layer tmds can be advantageous for defining qds @xmath45 electrical gating .",
    "the spin- and valley - polarized states in tmd qds also make them an interesting candidate for quantum information processing .",
    "nevertheless , gate - defined dqds have not been reported on either material thus far , nor have spin blockade or spin relaxation time measurements .",
    "another approach of reducing the edge effect of gnrs is to use functionalized graphene , such as fluorinated graphene ( fg ) , to simultaneously define the quantum confinement and passivate the graphene edges .",
    "nano - patterning of fluorinated graphene has been achieved by employing scanning probe lithography and electron beam irradiation @xcite ; in each case , graphene nanochannels are surrounded by insulating fg to form constrictions .",
    "however , to date , no functionalization - defined gqds have been reported experimentally .",
    "vertical tunneling to gqds using hbn as a tunnel barriers may also serve as a promising solution for minimizing the edge effect from graphene constrictions @xcite .",
    "vertical gqd tunneling devices offer several advantages over their lateral counterparts .",
    "tunneling can continue to occur even if the graphene bulk is in an insulating state ( for example , at high b - fields where landau levels are formed ) , and is expected to provide better resolution in fock - darwin spectrum since the b - field modulation on the gnr tunnel barriers is absent @xcite .",
    "recently , a vertical stack of a gnr and a 2d graphene sheet ( separated by a 13-nm - thick hbn layer ) has been reported , in which the coulomb resonances of the gnr was used to probe the local density of states of the graphene sheet @xcite .",
    "in addition , a stack of two gnrs vertically separated by a 12-nm - thick hbn layer has shown the characteristic features of a capacitively coupled double - dot structure in the charge stability diagram @xcite . however",
    ", experimental studies on vertical tunneling to graphene nanostructures through thin hbn as a tunnel barrier are still lacking .",
    "further efforts are encouraged to build such a system and investigate the spin relaxation dynamics in it .",
    "the spin - momentum locking nature of ti surface states offers the possibility of using ti qds as single spin generators . to date , no transport studies have been reported in which the spin polarization in a ti qd has been detected .",
