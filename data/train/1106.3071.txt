    "it has been proposed , first by @xcite for the case of sn  2003fg , that these four sne  ia exploded through dd mergers . while it requires @xmath4 of @xmath3ni to power a normal sn  ia lightcurve with a progenitor mass @xmath0  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite noted that some of the scsne host galaxies are relatively metal - poor .",
    "in our discussion of sn  2009nr  @xcite , we pointed out that for three of the four confirmed scsne events , the sne were located far from the centers of their host galaxies , and probably were in significantly lower metallicity environments than implied by the metallicity of their hosts central regions . the fourth case , sn  2007if , is located in a low - luminosity dwarf galaxy that has the lowest spectroscopically measured metallicity among sn  ia hosts ( 12+log(o / h)=@xmath9 or @xmath10 , @xcite , using the @xmath11 method of @xcite ) .",

    "spectra of the sn  2006gz host galaxy ic  1277 and the large galaxy near the presumed dwarf host of sn  2003fg were obtained on 2011 april 6 with the ohio state multi - object spectrograph ( osmos ; * ? ? ?",

    "the osmos slit was oriented n / s and was centered on the galaxies .",
    "the raw data were processed using standard techniques in iraf , including cosmic ray rejection using l.  a.  cosmic ( van dokkum 2001 ) . the slit location ( the red - sensitive inner slit[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) we used provides a wavelength coverage of 3960 - 6880  .",
    "the spectra were calibrated in wavelength using ar arclamp spectra and in flux using coincident observations of a spectrophotometric standard from oke ( 1990 ) .    for ic  1277 , we extracted spectra of four hii regions along the slit using apertures of 14 pixels ( 3.8 arcsec ) .",
    "we determined their oxygen abundances using the n2 diagnostic of @xcite , which depends solely on [ ] @xmath12/h@xmath13 . due to the proximity of the lines ,",
    "this ratio is very insensitive to reddening . for the galaxy near",
    "sn  2003fg , given the wavelength range at this redshift , only r23 methods were available to determine metallicity from the spectrum taken at its center , and estimates from the r23 methods were converted to the n2 scale that we used for ic  1277 using the empirical conversions of  @xcite .",
    "the r23 methods are very sensitive to reddening correction , and we corrected only for galactic reddening using e(b - v)=0.013  mag  @xcite , using the ccm function , and assuming r=3.1 .",

    "we fit simple exponential disk profiles to the large morphologically disturbed galaxy near the presumed dwarf host of sn  2003fg ( see figure  [ fig : sn03fg ] ) and to the host of sn  2006gz ( ic  1277 ) . for sn  2009dc ,",
    "we fit a two - component ( exponential plus sersic ) disk / bulge decomposition profile to the s0 host ugc  10064 .",
    "we also used the iraf@xmath14 ellipse tool to analyze the galaxy profiles produced by galfit to approximately determine what fraction of total light is located interior to the location of the sne in the hosts .",
    "finally , we determined the radial metallicity slope of the host galaxy of sn  2006gz ( ic  1277 ) from the spectroscopic data described in section  [ sec : data ] .",

    "the explosion site is @xmath20  kpc away from the center of the dwarf host , and thus under any assumption the sn would be located in a metal - poor environment if it is indeed associated with this dwarf galaxy .",
    "alternatively , the parameters derived by galfit indicate that the larger neighbour has an exponential disk scale length of @xmath21 or @xmath22  kpc .",
    "if this galaxy is the actual host , then the sn exploded @xmath23 disk scale lengths away from the center of its host . the galfit profile of this galaxy indicates that @xmath1 of its light is located interior to the location of the sn . an exponential disk profile is likely not the optimal function to model disturbed galaxies such as this , however there does not appear to be any significant flux excess towards the location of the sn except for the dwarf galaxy - like feature , and our estimate for the fraction of light within the sn location appear robust .",
    "metallicity estimates of the center of this galaxy from the spectroscopic data presented in section  [ sec : data ] using various r23 methods convert to a consistent value of 12+log(o / h)@xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) on the n2 diagnostic scale of @xcite .",
    "although the metallicity gradient of morphologically disturbed galaxies is uncertain , our measurement shows that sn  2003fg is likely associated with a low - metallicity environment even if it originated from material ejected from the large galaxy with metallicity as high as that of its central region .",

    "the parameters derived from galfit show that the host has an exponential disk scale length of @xmath74 ( @xmath75  kpc ) and its bulge ( sersic index @xmath76 ) has an effective radius of @xmath77 ( @xmath78  kpc ) .",
    "this indicates that the sn exploded @xmath79 exponential disk scale lengths away from center of ugc  10064 .",
    "the host is very highly inclined with galfit estimates for the axis ratio of @xmath80 for both the disk and the bulge components .",
    "if the sn exploded in an extended disk , the actual distance from the center of the host could be more than ten times larger , by simple geometric considerations .",
    "although the sn is located outside of @xmath71 of the galaxy s light , the sdss @xmath81 and @xmath82 band images show low surface brightness emission at the position of the sn that is fairly asymmetric around the galaxy , with more light in the side where the sn is ( nw ) compared to the opposite side ( se ) .",
    "this appears consistent with a fairly inclined disk , perhaps an extended disk .",
    "it has also been proposed by @xcite that sn  2009dc might be associated with a faint and narrow tidal stream connecting the host with the @xmath83 times less massive neighboring galaxy ugc  10063 and the progenitor system may have formed a few hundred myr ago during an interaction of these two galaxies .",
    "it is impossible to measure the gas phase oxygen abundance or the metallicity gradient of this gas - poor galaxy directly using gas - phase abundances as we did for the host of sn  2003fg , but the central region of ugc  10064 appears to have a relatively undisturbed s0 profile despite being in an interacting system , and it is reasonable to expect a metallicity gradient fairly similar to that of a relatively undisturbed spiral galaxy .",
    "since during a galaxy interaction it is easier to disturb mass that is not deep in the potential well of the significantly more massive galaxy , even if sn  2009dc originated from mass ejected from the host , it is likely associated with low - metallicity material stripped from the outer regions .",
    "several papers published recently have discussed low metallicity as an important ingredient for the progenitors of possible scsne explosions .",
    "@xcite noted that while the host galaxy types and distances of the scsne explosion sites from the centers of their hosts vary , a number of the scsne exploded far from the centers of the host galaxies .",
    "@xcite pointed out many unusual sne  ia , including the scsne , have been discovered in low luminosity hosts .",
    "@xcite concluded that scsne show a tendency to explode in low - mass galaxies , and low - metallicity progenitors may be an important prerequisite for producing superluminous sne  ia .",
    "@xcite observed that three of the four confirmed scsne events were located far from the centers of their host galaxies , probably in significantly lower metallicity environments than implied by the metallicity of their hosts central regions . in the current work ,",
    "we have quantitatively focused on their locations in the hosts to show that all of the scsne progenitors appear to be associated with regions of their hosts likely to be metal - poor .",
    "it is also important to note that the projected distances are only lower limits on the physical separations between the sn explosion sites and the centers of their hosts , and the actual distances will be larger and hence likely will have still lower metallicity .",
    "one could argue for a unique explanation for each of these four events , specially given that in two cases ( sn  2003fg and sn  2009dc ) the sne are associated with interacting systems , but occam s razor suggests that it is simply due to a characteristic they all share , such as low metallicity .",
    "although a detailed study of the stellar populations at the outer edges of the scsne host galaxies is not possible , studies of local group galaxies demonstrate that the outer regions of galaxies primarily contain metal - poor stars .",
    "the halo of the milky way is dominated by metal - poor stellar populations  @xcite . in case of the m31 spheroid",
    ", the metallicity is known to decrease monotonically with increasing radius  it has mean [ fe / h ] values of @xmath84 at 11  kpc , @xmath85 at 21  kpc , and @xmath86 at 35 kpc from the nucleus  @xcite . for m33 ,",
    "the stellar halo is significantly more metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath87 ) than would be inferred from the metallicity of the disk stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath88 , @xcite ) .",
    "these results provide strong circumstantial evidence supporting our conclusion that the scsne explosions far from the center of their hosts imply that their progenitors were located in metal - poor environments , likely linked to low - metallicity star formation not associated with central regions of their hosts .    beyond the local group , discovery of extended uv disks around nearby galaxies m83  @xcite and ngc  4625  @xcite",
    "have shown that while there is evidence for ongoing star formation in the very outer edges of these galaxies , both the star formation rate and total stellar mass in these regions are very small .",
    "dwarf galaxies and extended disks contain only a few percent of the total stellar mass or star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in the local universe about half of the stellar mass is contained in elliptical galaxies or the bulges of large spirals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "yet , all four of the confirmed scsne exploded in these environments . even including the additional candidate scsne considered by @xcite , for which the evidence of their scsn nature is less conclusive",
    ", none has exploded in an early type galaxy . in other words ,",
    "what is most striking about the scsne explosion sites is not where they are located , but rather where they are not : they avoid both spiral galaxy disks and elliptical galaxies , even though these are the regions that contain almost all the stellar mass and star formation .",
    "this is highly unlikely to be a selection effect , given that the scsne are some of the brightest sne  ia ever detected , and thus are easier to discover in sn surveys than ordinary sne  ia .",
    "the four confirmed scsne events are the high luminosity tail of the observed sne  ia luminosity distribution , and thus by inference , total wd mass .",
    "this raises the possibility that other slightly less luminous sne  ia may also have resulted from double - degenerate mergers resulting in progenitor masses exceeding the chandrasekhar limit by a narrower margin . as we discussed in @xcite , these bright sne  ia",
    "also tend to lie far from the centers of their hosts or in dwarf galaxies , suggesting more generally that their higher luminosities are likely related to the lower metallicities of their environments , although whether this is driven by age or metallicity is hotly debated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , figure  21 of @xcite shows that roughly a third of all sne  ia have a projected distance of @xmath89  kpc from the centers of hosts .",
    "some specific examples include sn  2007bk , where the over - luminous sn was found @xmath90  kpc away from its metal - poor ( @xmath34 ) dwarf host  @xcite , and the 1991t - like sn  2009nr which is located 4.3 disk scale lengths away from its host  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that in metal - poor systems the wd initial - final mass relation is highly unconventional and the low metallicity systems produce an unexpected overabundance of scsne  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "metallicity may also significantly contribute to the sn  ia delay time distribution  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the mapping of total wd mass to the expected @xmath3ni yield in the dd scenario  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be especially problematic in the very metal - poor tail of wd populations , and comparable wd masses may lead to a wide range of luminosities  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the sd scenario ,",
    "differential rotation of the wd has been proposed as a means of exceeding the chandrasekhar - mass limit  @xcite and low - metallicity may be required for sd progenitors to highly surpass this threshold  @xcite .",
    "the small sample size of four confirmed scsne limits our ability to verify any of these hypotheses , but the discovery of more scsne and re - analysis of previously discovered very luminous sne  ia should lead to a deeper understanding of the underlying systematics affecting sne  ia luminosities , rates , and the nature of their progenitors .",
