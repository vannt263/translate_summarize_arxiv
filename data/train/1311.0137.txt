    "@xmath1-quasi planar graphs _ ( we adopt the term _",

    "the class of @xmath1-nearly planar graphs does not have the good closedness properties of topologically - defined graph classes .",
    "in particular , they are not closed under topological minors or contractions  see corollary  [ notclosed ]  however they are closed under subgraphs .",
    "we stress that the study of nearly planar graphs marks a direction that is `` orthogonal '' to the one of ( topological ) minor free graphs as every graph is a topological minor of some @xmath4-nearly planar graph : take any drawing of a graph in the plane and for each edge @xmath5 , introduce a vertex in each segment delimited by two consecutive crossings along @xmath5 .",
    "several combinatorial and algorithmic results on planar graphs have been extended to @xmath1-nearly planar graphs .",
    "for instance , according pach and tth  @xcite , @xmath1-nearly planar graphs are sparse : each @xmath6-vertex @xmath1-nearly planar graph has at most @xmath7 edges .",
    "moreover bodlaender and grigoriev proved that several problems in graphs admit eptas ( efficient polynomial time approximation schemes ) when restricted to @xmath1-nearly planar graphs  @xcite .",
    "consider a distance metric between the vertices of graphs .",
    "we define the _ @xmath2-power _ of a graph @xmath0 under this metric as the graph with the same vertex set as @xmath0 and where two vertices @xmath8 and @xmath9 are adjacent if and only if their distance is upper bounded by @xmath2 .",
    "our aim is to define such a metric that `` captures '' the concept of @xmath1-nearly planar graphs .",
    "this metric is defined on embedded graphs and is called _ wall - by - wall _ distance ( for the definition see section  [ sec : classes ] ) .    to explain how wall - by - wall expresses @xmath1-nearly planar graphs , we introduce the concept of _ @xmath2-flat graphs _ that are subgraphs of the @xmath2-powers of plane graphs under the new metric .",
    "our main result is a proof , that the classes of @xmath2-flat graphs and @xmath1-nearly planar graphs are _ parametrically equivalent _ , i.e. , there are functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that every @xmath1-nearly planar graph is @xmath12-flat and every @xmath2-flat graph is @xmath13-nearly planar .",
    "this enables us to represent every nearly planar graph @xmath0 by a suitably - defined plane graph @xmath14 whose structure `` geometrically represents '' @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ defprel ] , we give some basic definitions and results . in section  [ sec : classes ] we introduce the notion of @xmath2-flat graphs and we prove several properties of them .",
    "the proof of our main result is presented in section  [ parma ] .",

    "given two graphs @xmath14 and @xmath0 , we write @xmath29 and call @xmath14 a _ minor _ of @xmath0 , if @xmath14 can be obtained from a subgraph of @xmath0 by edge contractions ( the _ contraction _ of an edge @xmath30 in a graph @xmath0 is the operation of replacing @xmath8 and @xmath9 by a new vertex @xmath31 that is made adjacent with all the neighbors of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath0 that are different from @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "moreover , we say that @xmath14 is a _ contraction _ of @xmath0 if @xmath14 can be obtained from @xmath0 by contracting edges .",
    "we say that @xmath14 is a _ topological minor _ of @xmath0 if a subdivision of @xmath14 is a subgraph of @xmath0 ( the _ subdivision _ of an edge @xmath30 is its replacement by a path of length 2 whose endpoints are @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",

    "a graph is _ planar _ if it has some planar embedding .",
    "given a plane graph @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath35 the set of faces of @xmath0 , i.e. , the connected components of @xmath36 , that are open sets .    * radial and medial graph*. given a plane graph @xmath0 with at least one edge , we define its _ radial graph _ @xmath37 as the plane graph whose vertex set is @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the dual graph of @xmath0 ) and whose edges are defined as follows : let @xmath40 be the connected components of @xmath41 isomorphic to open discs .",

    "notice that , by construction , @xmath57 is indeed a plane graph . for an illustration of the construction of @xmath57 , see figure  [ fig : gadget ] .",
    "we will be referring to this procedure as _ plane transformation _ of a graph .",
    "let @xmath0 be a plane graph . for any vertex @xmath58 ,",
    "the edges incident to @xmath59 appear in the drawing in the natural cyclic order which we denote by @xmath60 ( such a cyclic order is well defined as @xmath0 is loopless ) .",

    "intuitively , such a walk can be explained in the following way .",
    "let the plane graph represent a building map where edges represent walls , each having a door .",
    "then , a _ wall - by - wall - walk _ , denoted also as a * wbw*-walk , is a walk from wall @xmath56 to wall @xmath66 continuously touching walls and possibly going through doors .    now , let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be two vertices of the plane graph @xmath0 .",

    "the _ wall - by - wall distance between @xmath8 and @xmath9 _ , denoted by * wbw * , is the number of edges in the shortest @xmath67-*wbw*-walk , if such a walk exists , otherwise it is infinite ( in the case that no path in @xmath0 connects @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",

    "again , we use the notations _ * wbw*-path _ and _ @xmath67-*wbw*-path_.",
    "notice that the wall - by - wall distance is lower bounded by the standard distance in graphs .",
    "however , the difference between the two distances may be arbitrarily large , [ e.g. the distance of two non adjacent vertices of a star ] .",
