    "the last decade has witnessed tremendous interest devoted to the investigation of collective phenomena in multiple autonomous agents , due to broad applications in various fields of science ranging from biology to physics , engineering , and ecology , just to name a few @xcite . concerning the issues of multi - agent systems and distributed design , the revolutionary idea is underpinning a strong interaction of individual dynamics , communication topologies , and distributed controls .",
    "the problem is generally very challenging due to the complex dynamics and hierarchical structures of the systems .",
    "however , efforts have been started with relatively simple problems such as consensus , formation , and rendezvous , and many significant results have been obtained .",
    "the leader - follower coordination is an important multi - agent control problem , where the leader may be a real leader ( such as a target , an evader , or a predefined position ) , or a virtual leader ( such as a reference trajectory or a specified path ) . in most theoretical work ,",
    "a single leader with exact measurement is considered on multi - agent systems for each agent to follow . however , in practical situations , multiple leaders and target sets with unmeasurable variables are considered to achieve desired collective behaviors . in @xcite ,",
    "a simple model was given to simulate fish foraging and demonstrate the leader effectiveness when the leaders ( or informed agents ) guide a school of fish to a particular food region . in @xcite , a straight - line formation of a group of agents was discussed , where all the agents converge to the line segment specified by two edge leaders .",
    "a containment control scheme was proposed with fixed undirected interaction in @xcite , which aimed at driving a group of agents to a given target location and making their positions contained in the polytope spanned by multiple stationary or moving leaders during their motion .",
    "region following formation control was constructed @xcite , where all the robots are driven and then stay within a moving target region as a group . moreover , different dynamic connectivity conditions were obtained to guarantee that the multiple leaders ( or informed agents ) aggregate the whole multi - agent group within a convex target set in @xcite .",
    "additionally , control strategies were demonstrated and analyzed to drive a collection of mobile agents to stationary / moving leaders with connectivity - maintenance and collision - avoidance with fixed and switching directed network topologies in @xcite . as a matter of fact , multiple leaders are usually assigned to increase control effectiveness , enhance communication / sensing range , improve reliability , and optimize energy cost in multi - agent coordination .",
    "connectivity plays a key role in the coordination of multi - agent networks , which is related to the influence of agents and controllability of the network . due to mobility of the agents ,",
    "inter - agent topologies usually keep changing in practice .",
    "therefore , the various connectivity conditions to describe frequently switching topologies in order to deal with multi - agent consensus or flocking @xcite .",
    "in fact , the  joint connection \" or similar concepts are important in the analysis of stability and convergence to guarantee multi - agent coordination with time - dependent topology .",
    "uniformly jointly - connected conditions have been employed for different problems .",
    "@xcite studied the distributed asynchronous iterations , while @xcite proved the consensus of a simplified vicsek model .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite investigated the jointly - connected coordination for second - order agent dynamics via different approaches , while @xcite worked on nonlinear continuous - time agent dynamics with jointly - connected interaction graphs . also , flocking of multi - agent system with state - dependent topology was studied with non - smooth analysis in @xcite .",
    "what is more , the @xmath0 joint connection condition , which is more generalized than the uniformly joint connection assumption , was discussed by moreau , in order to achieve the consensus for discrete - time agents in @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0 connectivity concept was then extended in the distributed control analysis for the target set convergence in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that input - to - state stability ( iss ) is an important and very useful tool in the study of the stability and stabilization of control systems @xcite .",
    "its variants such as integral input - to - state stability ( iiss ) were discussed in @xcite . then few works on set input - to - state stability ( siss ) were done with respect to fixed sets in @xcite . on the other hand , iss or related ideas can facilitate the control analysis and synthesis with interconnection conditions like small gains ( referring to @xcite , for example ) .",
    "iss has recently been applied to the stability study of a group of interconnected nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , an extended concept called leader - to - formation stability was introduced to investigate the stability of the formation of a group of agents in light of iss properties @xcite .",
    "in fact , iss application in multi - agent systems is promising .",
    "the contributions of the paper include :    * we propose the generalized set input - to - state stability ( siss ) and set integral - input - to - state stability ( siiss ) to handle moving sets with time - varying shapes for switching multi - agent networks .",
    "* we study the multi - leader coordination from the iss viewpoint . with the help of siss and siiss",
    ", we give explicit expressions to estimate the convergence rate and tracking error of a group of mobile agents that try to enter the convex hull determined by multiple leaders .",
    "* we show relationships between the connectivity and set tracking of the multi - agent system , and find that various jointly - connected conditions usually provide necessary and/or sufficient conditions for distributed coordination . *",
    "we develop a method to study siss and siiss for a moving set and switching topology with graph theory and non - smooth analysis .",
    "in fact , we can not take the standard approaches to conventional iss or iiss using equivalent iss - lyapunov functions @xcite .",
    "in addition , the classic algebraic methods based on laplacian may fail due to disturbances in nonlinear agent dynamics , uncertain leader velocities , or moving multi - leader set .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the preliminaries and problem formulation , while section 3 proposes results for the convergence estimation .",
    "section 4 mainly reports a necessary and sufficient condition for the siss with respect to the moving multi - leader set with switching inter - agent topologies , and then presents a set - tracking case based on the siss .",
    "correspondingly , section 5 obtains necessary and sufficient conditions for siiss and then shows set - tracking results related to siiss . finally , section 6 gives concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we introduce some preliminary knowledge for the following discussion .    first we introduce some basic concepts in graph theory ( referring to @xcite for details ) . a directed graph ( digraph ) @xmath1",
    "consists of a finite set @xmath2 of nodes and an arc set @xmath3 , in which an arc is an ordered pair of distinct nodes of @xmath4 .",

    "a walk is called a _ path _",
    "if the nodes of this walk are distinct , and a path from @xmath6 to @xmath7 is denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "node @xmath7 is called _ reachable _ from @xmath6 if there is a path @xmath13 .",
    "if the nodes @xmath14 are distinct and @xmath15 , @xmath16 is called a ( directed ) _ cycle_. a digraph without cycles",
    "is said to be _",
    "acyclic_.    the union of the two digraphs @xmath17 and @xmath18",

    "furthermore , a time - varying digraph is defined as @xmath20 with @xmath21 as a piecewise constant function , where @xmath22 is the finite set which consists of all the possible digraphs with node set @xmath4 . moreover , the joint digraph of @xmath23 in time interval @xmath24 with @xmath25 is denoted as @xmath26    next , we recall some notations in convex analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a set @xmath27 is said to be convex if @xmath28 whenever @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for any set @xmath31",
    ", the intersection of all convex sets containing @xmath32 is called the _ convex hull _ of @xmath32 , denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "particularly , the convex hull of a finite set of points @xmath34 is a polytope , denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 be a closed convex subset in @xmath38 and denote @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the euclidean norm for a vector or the absolute value of a scalar ( @xcite ) .",

[ lem6 ] suppose @xmath27 is a convex set and @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath50 , then @xmath51 and @xmath52 be two real numbers and consider a function @xmath53 and a point @xmath54 .",
    "the upper dini derivative of @xmath55 at @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 it is well known that when @xmath55 is continuous on @xmath58 , @xmath55 is non - increasing on @xmath58 if and only if @xmath59 for any @xmath54 ( more details can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the next result is given for the calculation of dini derivative @xcite .",
    "[ lem3 ] let @xmath60 be @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "the follower set is denoted as @xmath67 , and the leader set is denoted as @xmath68 . in what follows , we will identify follower @xmath69 or leader @xmath70 with its index @xmath6 ( namely , agent @xmath6 or leader @xmath6 ) if there is no confusion .",
    "then we describe the communication in the multi - agent network . at time @xmath56 , if @xmath71 can  see \" @xmath72 , there is an arc @xmath73 ( marking the information flow ) from @xmath7 to @xmath6 , and then agent @xmath7 is said to be a _ neighbor _ of agent @xmath6 .",

    "let @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent the set of agent @xmath6 s neighbors and the set of agent @xmath6 s leaders ( that is , the leaders which are connected to agent @xmath6 ) , respectively .",
    "note that , since the leaders are not influenced by the followers , there is no arc leaving from @xmath77 entering @xmath78 .",
    "define @xmath79 as the whole agent set ( including leaders and followers ) .",
    "denote @xmath80 as the set of all possible interconnection topologies , and @xmath81 as a piecewise constant switching signal function to describe the switchings between the topologies .",
    "thus , the interaction topology of the considered multi - agent network is described by a time - varying directed graph @xmath82 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath83 is denoted as the communication graph among the follower agents .",

    "as usual in the literature @xcite , an assumption is given for the switching signal @xmath87 .",
    "* assumption 1 * ( dwell time ) there is a lower bound @xmath88 between two switching instants .",
    "we give definitions for the connectivity of a multi - agent system with multiple leaders .",

    "note that the l - connectedness describes the capacity for the follower agents to get the information from the moving multi - leader set in the information flow , and an l - connected graph may not be connected since the graph with leaders as its nodes may not be connected .",
    "in fact , if we consider the group of the leaders as one virtual node in @xmath4 , then the l - connectedness becomes the quasi - strong connectedness for a digraph @xcite .",
