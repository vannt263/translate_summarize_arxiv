    "characterizing statistical properties of cyber attacks not only can deepen our understanding of cyber threats but also can lead to implications for effective cyber defense .",
    "honeypot is an important tool for collecting cyber attack data , which can be seen as a  birthmark \" of the cyber threat landscape as observed from a certain ip address space .",
    "studying this kind of data allows us to extract useful information about , and even predict , cyber attacks . despite the popularity of honeypots ,",
    "there is no systematic framework for rigorously analyzing the statistical properties of honeypot - captured cyber attack data .",
    "this may be attributed to that a systematic framework would require both a nice abstraction of cyber attacks and fairly advanced statistical techniques .    in this paper",
    ", we make three contributions .",
    "first , we propose , to our knowledge , the first statistical framework for systematically analyzing and exploiting honeypot - captured cyber attack data .",
    "the framework is centered on the concept we call _ stochastic cyber attack process _ , which is a new kind of mathematical objects that can naturally model cyber attacks .",
    "this concept can be instantiated at multiple resolutions , such as : network - level ( i.e. , considering all attacks against a network as a whole ) , victim - level ( i.e. , considering all attacks against a computer or ip address as a whole ) , port - level ( i.e. , the defender cares most about the attacks against certain ports or services ) .",
    "this concept catalyzes the following fundamental questions : ( i ) what statistical properties do stochastic cyber attack processes exhibit ( e.g. , are they poisson ) ?",
    "( ii ) what are the implications of these properties and , in particular , can we exploit them to predict the incoming attacks ( prediction capability is the core utility of the framework ) ?",
    "( iii ) what caused these properties ?",
    "thus , the present paper formulates a way of thinking for rigorously analyzing honeypot data .",
    "second , we demonstrate use of the framework by applying it to analyze a dataset , which is collected by a _",
    "low - interaction _ honeypot of 166 ip addresses for five periods of time ( 220 days cumulative ) .",
    "findings of the case study include : ( i ) stochastic cyber attack processes are not poisson , but instead can exhibit long - range dependence ( lrd )  a property that is not known to be exhibited by honeypot data until now .",
    "this finding has profound implications for modeling cyber attacks .",
    "( ii ) lrd can be exploited to predict the incoming attacks at least in terms of attack rate ( i.e. , number of attacks per time unit ) .",
    "this is especially true for network - level stochastic cyber attack processes .",
    "this shows the power of  gray - box \" prediction , where the prediction models accommodate the lrd property ( or other statistical properties that are identified ) .",
    "( iii ) although we can not precisely pin down the cause of the lrd exhibited by honeypot data , we manage to rule out two possible causes .",
    "we find that the cause of lrd exhibited by cyber attacks might be different from the cause of lrd exhibited by benign traffic ( see section [ sec : step-5 ] ) .",
    "third , the framework can be equally applied to analyze both _",
    "low - interaction _ and _ high - interaction _ honeypot data , while the latter contains richer information about attacks and allows even finer - resolution analysis .",
    "thus , we plan to make our statistical framework software code publicly available so that other researchers or even practitioners , who have ( for example ) high - interaction honeypot data that often can not be shared with third parties , can analyze their data without learning the advanced statistic skills .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : preliminaries ] briefly reviews some statistical preliminaries including prediction accuracy measures , while some detailed statistical techniques are deferred to the appendix .",
    "section [ sec : concept - and - framework ] describes the framework . section [ sec : case - study ] discusses the case study and its limitations .",
    "section [ sec : total - discussion ] discusses the limitation of the case study ( which is imposed by the specific dataset ) and the usefulness of the framework in a broader context .",
    "section [ sec : related - work ] discusses related prior work .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper with future research directions .",
    "a stationary time sequence @xmath0 , which instantiates a stochastic cyber attack process @xmath1 , is said to possess lrd @xcite if its autocorrelation function @xmath2 for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is called  lag \" , @xmath5 is a slowly varying function meaning that @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",
    "intuitively , lrd says that a stochastic process exhibits persistent correlations , namely that the rate of autocorrelation decays slowly ( i.e. , slower than an exponential decay ) .",
    "quantitatively speaking , the degree of lrd is expressed by hurst parameter ( h ) , which is related to the parameter @xmath8 in eq . as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this means that for lrd , we have @xmath10 and the degree of lrd increases as @xmath11 . in the appendix , we briefly review six popular hurst - estimation methods that are used in this paper .",
    "since @xmath10 is necessary but not sufficient for lrd , we need to eliminate the so - called  spurious lrd \" as we focus on the lrd property in this paper .",
    "spurious lrd can be caused by non - stationarity @xcite , or more specifically caused by ( i ) short - range dependent time series with change points in the mean or ( ii ) slowly varying trends with random noise @xcite .",
    "we eliminate spurious lrd processes by testing the null hypothesis ( denoted by @xmath12 ) that a given time series is a stationary lrd process against the alternative hypothesis ( denoted by @xmath13 ) that it is affected by change points or a smoothly varying trend @xcite .",
    "one test is for @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a stationary short - memory process @xcite , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a bernoulli random variable , and @xmath19 is a white ( i.e. , gaussian ) noise process .",
    "the other alternative is : @xmath20 where @xmath16 is as in the previous test , @xmath21 $ ] is a lipschitz continuous function @xcite , and @xmath22 is the sample size .",
    "we call a model _ lrd - less _ if it can not accommodate lrd and _ lrd - aware _ if it can accommodate lrd .",
    "let @xmath23 be independent and identical normal random variables with mean @xmath24 and variance @xmath25 .",
    "we consider two popular models .",
    "* lrd - less model arma@xmath26 : this is the autoregressive moving average process of orders @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 it is one of the most popular models in time series @xcite .",
    "* lrd - aware model farima@xmath30 : this is the well - known fractional arima model where @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite . specifically , a stationary process @xmath33 is called farima@xmath30 if @xmath34 for some @xmath35 , where @xmath36 @xmath37 is the back shift operator defined by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and so on .",
    "suppose @xmath40 are observed data ( e.g. , the attack rate @xmath33 for @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 are the predicted data .",
    "we can define prediction error @xmath43 for @xmath41 .",
    "recall the popular statistic pmad ( percent mean absolute deviation ) : @xmath44 which can be seen as the overall prediction error .",
    "we also define a variant of it , called _ underestimation error _ , which considers only the underestimations as follows : @xmath45 underestimation error is useful especially when the defender is willing to over - provision some defense resources and is more concerned with the attacks that can be overlooked because of insufficient provisioning of defense resources ( e.g. , when the attack rate is high and beyond the processing capacity of the defender s provisioned defense resources , the defender may have to skip examining the traffic in order not to disrupt the services in question ) .",
    "it is also convenient to use the following _ overall accuracy _ measure ( oa for short ) and _ underestimation accuracy _ measure ( ua for short ) : @xmath46",
    "concept at the right level of abstraction is often important . for describing and modeling cyber attacks , _ stochastic cyber attack processes _ ( often called _ attack processes _ for short in the rest of paper )",
    "are a natural abstraction because cyber attack events in principle formulate point processes @xcite .",
    "formally , a stochastic cyber attack process is described as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the random variable ( e.g. , attack rate ) at time @xmath49 . rigorously characterizing the _ mathematical / probabilistic _ properties of stochastic cyber attack processes",
    "is an important problem for theoretical cyber security research , and may not be possible before we have good understandings about their _ statistical _ properties  the present paper is one such effort .",
    "stochastic cyber attack processes can be instantiated at multiple resolutions .",
    "for example , _ network - level _ attack processes accommodate cyber attacks against networks of interest ; _ victim - level _ attack processes accommodate cyber attacks against individual computers or ip addresses ; _ port - level _ attack processes accommodate cyber attacks against individual ports .",
    "the distinction of model resolution is important because a high - level ( i.e. , low - resolution ) attack process may be seen as the superposition of multiple low - level ( i.e. , high - resolution ) attack processes , which may help explain the cause , or rule out some candidate causes , of a property exhibited by the high - level process ( see step 5 in section [ sec : analysis - framework ] below for general description and section [ sec : step-5 ] for case study ) .",
    "figure [ fig : coars - grained - attack ] illustrates the attacks against individual victim ip addresses , where dots on the same time axis formulate a victim - level attack process . figure [ fig : intermediate - grained - attack ] further shows that a victim is attacked by @xmath50 attackers ( or attacking computers ) at some ports and the attacks arrive at time @xmath51 .",
    "the framework is presented as a 5-step procedure .",
    "step 1 ( data pre - processing ) is presented for completeness because the data may be collected by software or hardware .",
    "step 2 ( basic statistical analysis ) serves the purpose of providing hints for step 3 ( advanced statistical analysis for identifying statistical properties of attack processes ) , which in turn serves as the base for step 4 (  gray - box \" prediction ) and step 5 ( exploring the cause of the newly identified statistical properties ) .",
    "[ [ step-1-data - pre - processing ] ] * step 1 : data pre - processing * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it is now a common practice to treat honeypot - captured data as attacks because there are no legitimate services and the honeypot computers passively wait for incoming events .",
    "honeypot - captured cyber attack data is often organized according to the honeypot ip addresses .",
    "pre - processing mainly deals with two issues .",
    "first , we may need to differentiate the attack traffic corresponding to the _ production ports _ that are associated to some honeypot programs / services , and the attack traffic corresponding to the _ non - production ports _ that are not associated to any services .",
    "second , in order to analyze statistical properties exhibited by honeypot - captured cyber attack data , we advocate using flows , rather than ip packets , to represent attacks because of the following .",
    "( i ) for low - interaction honeypots data , attack payload is often missing and information about attacks is often captured from the perspective of communication behaviors .",
    "this suggests that flow is appropriate for analyzing honeypot - captured cyber attack data .",
    "( ii ) flow - based intrusion detection is complementary to the traditional packet - based intrusion detection .",
    "for example , flow - based abstraction can be used to detect attacks such as dos ( denial - of - service ) , scan , worm @xcite .",
    "( iii ) flow - based abstraction can deal with encrypted attack payload @xcite , which can not be dealt with by packet - level analysis .",
    "the concept of flow accommodates both tcp and udp .",
    "there are cots devices that can readily extract flows .",
    "however , when honeypot data is collected by software in the format of pcap data , we need to parse it and re - assemble into flows .",
    "since flow assembly is a standard technique , in what follows we only briefly review the assembly of tcp flows .",
    "a tcp flow is uniquely identified from honeypot - collected raw pcap data via the attacker s ip address , the port used by the attacker , the victim ip address in the honeypot , and the port that is under attack .",
    "an unfinished tcp handshake can also be treated as a flow ( attack ) because an unsuccessful handshake can be caused by events such as : the port in question is busy ( i.e. , the connection is dropped ) . for flows that do not end with the fin flag ( which would indicate safe termination of tcp connection ) or the rst flag ( which would indicate unnatural termination of tcp connection ) , we need to choose two parameters in the pre - processing .",
    "one parameter is the _ flow timeout time _ , meaning that a flow is considered expired when no packet of the flow is received during a time window .",
    "for example , 60 seconds would be reasonable for low - interaction honeypots that provide limited interactions @xcite , but a longer time may be needed for high - interaction honeypots .",
    "the other parameter is the _ flow lifetime _ , meaning that a flow is considered expired when a flow lives longer than a pre - determined lifetime , which can be set as 300 seconds for low - interaction honeypots @xcite but a longer time may be needed for high - interaction honeypots .",
    "[ [ step-2-basic - statistical - analysis ] ] * step 2 : basic statistical analysis * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the basic statistics of cyber attack data can offer hints for advanced statistical analysis .",
    "for stochastic cyber attack processes , the primary statistic is the _ attack rate _ , which describes the number of attacks that arrive at unit time ( e.g. , minute or hour or day ) .",
    "note that attack rate can be instantiated at various resolutions of attack processes , such as : network - level attack rate , victim - level attack rate and port - level attack rate .",
    "the secondary statistic is the _ attack inter - arrival time _ , which describes the time intervals between two consecutive attack events . by investigating the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 of these statistics",
    ", we can identify outliers and obtain hints about the properties of the attack processes .",
    "for example , if the attack events are bursty , an attack process may not be poisson , which can serve as a hint for further advanced statistical analysis .",
    "[ [ step-3-advanced - statistical - analysis - identifying - statistical - properties - of - attack - processes ] ] * step 3 : advanced statistical analysis : identifying statistical properties of attack processes * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this step is to identify statistical properties of attack processes at resolutions of interest .",
    "a particular question that should be asked is : are the attack processes poisson ?",
    "recall that the poisson process counts the number of events that occur during time intervals , where  events \" in the context of this paper are the attacks observed by honeypots .",
    "if not poisson , what properties do they exhibit ?",
    "it would be ideal that the attack processes are poisson because we can easily characterize poisson processes with very few parameters , and because there are many mature methods and techniques for analyzing them .",
    "for example , we can use the property  the superposition of poisson processes is still a poisson process @xcite  to simplify problems when we consider attack processes at multiple resolutions / levels . in many cases , attack processes may not be poisson . for characterizing such processes , we need to use advanced statistical methods , such as markov process , lvy process , and time - series methods @xcite .",
    "this step is crucial because identifying advanced statistical properties can pave the way for answering the next questions .",
    "this step can be quite involved in terms of statistical skills when the attack processes are not poisson .",
    "[ [ step-4-exploiting - the - statistical - properties ] ] * step 4 : exploiting the statistical properties * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this step addresses the following question : how can we exploit the statistical properties of stochastic cyber attack processes to do useful things ?",
    "one exploitation is to conduct  gray - box \" prediction of the incoming attacks , at least in terms of attack rate at the appropriate resolution ( which in turn depends on the data is collected by low - interaction or high - interaction honeypot ) . by ",
    "gray - box \" prediction we mean that if an attack process exhibits a certain property that is identified in step 3 ( e.g. , long - range dependence @xcite or short - range dependence @xcite ) , the prediction model should accommodate the property as well .",
    "algorithm [ prediction - algorithm ] describes a general  gray - box \" prediction algorithm , where @xmath57 is the sequence of attack rates observed at time @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the number of steps ( e.g. , hours ) we want to predict ahead of time .",
    "in addition to  gray - box \" prediction , algorithm [ prediction - algorithm ] is novel also because it selects the best model ( from a family of models ) at each prediction step , which is important because there may be no single model that can fit the observed data well at all steps .",
    "input : observed attack rates @xmath57 , @xmath59 ( steps ahead ) + output : prediction results @xmath60       we note that although the prediction is geared toward honeypot - oriented traffic , it can be useful for defending production networks as well .",
    "this is because when honeypot - captured attacks are increasing ( or decreasing ) , the attack rate with respect to production networks might also be increasing ( or decreasing ) as long as the honeypots are approximately uniformly deployed in the ip address space in question .",
    "this can be achieved by blending honeypot ip addresses into production ip addresses . since being able to predict incoming attacks ( especially hours ahead of time )",
    "is always appealing , this would give incentives to deploy honeypots as such . as a result , it is possible to characterize the relation between the attack traffic into the honeypot ip addresses and the attack traffic into the production ip addresses .    [",
    "[ step-5-exploring - cause - of - the - statistical - properties ] ] * step 5 : exploring cause of the statistical properties * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this step aims to address the following question : what caused the statistical properties exhibited by stochastic cyber attack processes ?",
    "this question is interesting because it reflects a kind of  natural \" phenomenon in cyberspace . it would be ideal that one can mathematically prove the cause of a property",
    "this type of  theoretical proof \" approach is often difficult , as witnessed by the outcome of the past two decades of effort at studying the long - range dependence exhibited by benign internet traffic ( see section [ sec : related - work ] ) .",
    "therefore , we advocate the  experimental \" approach , which includes the following two specific methods . the first method is to study the decomposed lower - level ( i.e. , higher - resolution ) stochastic cyber attack processes .",
    "for example , in order to investigate whether or not a certain property is caused by another certain property of the low - level ( i.e. , high - resolution ) processes , we can decompose a victim - level attack process into port - level attack processes that correspond to the individual ports of the victim .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : decomposition - method - port - centric ] , where the victim - level attack process is decomposed into @xmath61 port - level attack processes .",
    "the second method is to investigate whether or not a certain property is caused by the intense ( consecutive ) attacks that are launched by individual attackers .",
    "for this purpose , we can consider the attacks against each victim that are launched by _",
    "distinct _ attackers .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : decomposition - method - attacker - centric ] , even though an attacker launched multiple consecutive attacks against a victim , we only need to consider the first attack .",
    "if the attacker - level attack processes do _ not _ exhibit the property that is exhibited by the victim - level attack processes , we can conclude that the property is probably caused by the intensity of the attacks that are launched by individual attackers .",
    "to demonstrate use of the framework , we conduct a case study by applying it to analyze a dataset that was collected by a _",
    "low - interaction _ honeypot .",
    "as mentioned above , the framework can be equally applied to analyze _ high - interaction _ honeypot data .",
    "the dataset for our case study was collected by a honeypot , which ran four popular low - interaction honeypot software programs : dionaea @xcite , mwcollector @xcite , amun @xcite , and nepenthes @xcite .",
    "the vulnerable services offered by all four honeypot programs are smb , netbios , http , mysql and ssh , each of which is associated to a unique tcp port .",
    "these are the production ports .",
    "each honeypot ip address was assigned to one of these programs and was completely isolated from the other honeypot ip addresses .",
    "a single honeypot computer was assigned with multiple ip addresses to run multiple honeypot software programs .",
    "a dedicated computer was used to collect the raw network traffic as pcap files , which were timestamped at the resolution of microsecond .",
    "table [ table : data - description ] summarizes the dataset , which corresponds to 166 victim / honeypot ip addresses for five periods of time .",
    "these periods are not strictly consecutive because of network / system maintenance etc .    in our pre - processing , we resolve the two issues described in the framework as follows .",
    "first , we disregard the attacks against the non - production ports because such tcp connections are often dropped .",
    "note that the specific attacks against the production ports are dependent upon the vulnerabilities emulated by the honeypot programs ( e.g. , microsoft windows server service buffer overflow ms06040 and workstation service vulnerability ms06070 for the smb service ) .",
    "since low - interaction honeypots do not capture sufficient information for precisely recognizing the specific attacks , we do not look into specific attack types .",
    "second , for flows that do not end with the fin flag ( indicating safe termination of tcp connection ) or the rst flag ( indicating unnatural termination of tcp connection ) , we use the following two parameter values : 60 seconds for the _ flow timeout time _ and 300 seconds for the _ flow lifetime_.      we consider the _ per - hour _ attack rate at three resolutions : the honeypot network , individual victim ip address , and individual production port of each victim . the choice of _ per - hour _ is natural , while noting that _ per - day _ attack rate is not appropriate because each period is no more than 80 days . since the numbers of victim - level and port - level attack processes are much larger than the number of network - level attack processes , different methods are used to represent their basic statistics .",
    "[ [ basic - statistics - of - network - level - attack - processes ] ] * basic statistics of network - level attack processes * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for network - level attack processes , it is feasible and appropriate to plot the time series of the attack rate ( per hour ) , namely the total number of attacks against the honeypot network of 166 victims . figure [ fig : time - series - period - wise ] plots the time series of attacks .",
    "we make the following observations .",
    "first , the five periods exhibit different attack patterns .",
    "for example , periods i , ii and v are relatively stationary .",
    "second , there are some extremely intense attacks during some hours in periods iii and iv .",
    "the specific hour corresponding to the extreme value in period iii is apr 01 , 2011 , 12 noon ( us eastern time ) ; the attacks are against the ssh services .",
    "it is evident that the attacks are brute - forcing password .",
    "the peak of attacks during period iv occurs at may 16 , 2011 , 3 am ( us eastern time ) .",
    "the intense attacks are against the http service .",
    "we find no information from the internet whether or not there are worm / botnet outbreaks that correspond to the peaks .",
    "third , although the five plots exhibit some change - points , a formal statistical analysis ( using the method reviewed in section [ sec : preliminaries ] for removing spurious lrd ) shows that change - points exist only in period iii , which correspond to the largest attack rate .",
    "this means that visual observations can be misleading and rigorous statistical analysis is perhaps necessary .",
    "table [ table : period - centric - basic - statistics ] describes the basic statistics of the network - level attack rate . on average , the victim network is least intensively attacked during period iv because the average per - hour attack rate is about 9861 , which is smaller than the average attack rate during the other periods .",
    "the variances of attack rates are much larger than the corresponding mean attack rates , which _ hints _ that these processes are not poisson . as we show via formal statistical analysis in section [ sec : step-3 ] , these processes actually exhibit lrd instead .",
    ".basic statistics of network - level attack processes . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to see whether or not the attacker - level attack processes still exhibit lrd , we describe their hurst parameters in table [ table : h - parameter - attack - rate - attacker - centric - production - ports - only ] .",
    "using period i as an example , we observe that the attacker - level attack processes corresponding to 153 ( out of the 166 ) victims suggest lrd because their average hurst parameter @xmath62 $ ] , where the average is taken over the six hurst estimation methods .",
    "moreover , none of the 153 attacker - level processes exhibit spurious lrd . using period v as another example , we observe that all 166 attacker - level attack processes have average hurst parameter @xmath62 $ ] , but only 77 attacker - level attack processes exhibit lrd while the other 89 attacker - level attack processes exhibit spurious lrd ( caused by non - stationarity of the processes ) .",
    "the above discussion suggests that lrd exhibited by victim - level attack processes is not caused by the intense ( consecutive ) attacks launched by individual attackers , simply because most ( or many ) attacker - level attack processes also exhibit lrd .",
    "[ [ summary-2 ] ] * summary * + + + + + + + + +    the lrd exhibited by stochastic cyber attack processes is neither necessarily caused by the superposition of heavy - tailed processes , nor necessarily caused by the intense attacks launched by individual attackers .",
    "while we ruled out these two candidate causes , it is an interesting and challenging future work to precisely pin down the cause of lrd in this context .",
    "in this section we discuss the limitation of the case study and the usefulness of the statistical framework .",
    "the case study has three limitations that are imposed by the specific dataset .",
    "first , the dataset , albeit over @xmath63 days in total ( 5 periods of time ) , only corresponds to 166 honeypot ip addresses .",
    "we wish to have access to bigger datasets .",
    "still , this paper explores an important direction in cyber security research , especially the feasibility of predicting incoming attacks .",
    "fortunately , the statistical framework can be adopted by researchers to analyze their ( bigger ) datasets .",
    "second , the dataset is attack - agnostic in the sense that we know the ports / services the attackers attempt to attack , but not the specific attacks because the data was collected using low - interaction honeypots .",
    "although this issue can be resolved by using high - interaction honeypots @xcite , there are legitimate concerns about high - interaction honeypots from a legal perspective . nevertheless , the framework is equally applicable to analyze high - interactive honeypot data .",
    "for example , there might be researchers who have collected high - interaction honeypot data and are not allowed to share the data with others .",
    "these researchers can adopt the framework to analyze their data at a finer resolution ( e.g. , the attack level that an attack process can accommodate one or multiple families of attacks ) .",
    "third , the data is collected using honeypot rather than using production network . for real - life adoption of the prediction capability presented in the paper , attack traffic",
    "would be blended into the production traffic .",
    "whether or not the blended traffic also exhibits lrd is an interesting future study topic .",
    "the main challenge again is the legal and privacy concerns in collecting such data .      the usefulness of the statistical framework ( or analysis methodology )",
    "can be seen from the following perspectives .",
    "first , the framework has _ descriptive _ power because it aims to study the advanced statistical properties exhibited by the cyber attack data that instantiates stochastic cyber attack process .",
    "the advanced statistical properties are not known a prior . in order to obtain hints for the kinds of advanced statistical properties that may be relevant ,",
    "the framework starts at studying basic statistical properties exhibited by the data .",
    "the hinted statistical properties are rigorously examined by using advanced statistical techniques , which fall into the framework of hypothesis testing ( e.g. , whether lrd is exhibited or not is tested based on the values of the hurst parameters that are estimated using the rigorous statistical methods reviewed in appendix [ sec : hurst - parameter - estimation - methods ] ) .",
    "indeed , the framework guided us to identify the relevance of lrd in this aspect of cyber security , which is not known until now .",
    "second , the framework has _ predictive _ power because , as confirmed by the case study , it allows to exploit the newly identified advanced statistical properties to predict the attack rate possibly hours ahead of time .",
    "this kind of property - inspired  gray - box \" prediction , rather than  black - box \" prediction , allows the defender to proactively provision defense resources .",
    "although the specific dataset used in our case study is collected by a low - interaction honeypot , the concept of stochastic cyber attack process can equally describe the attacks that are observed at high - interaction honeypots .",
    "since high - interaction honeypots can collect more information about attacks , the framework can be equally applied to analyze the data with respect to specific attacks . as a result",
    ", we can predict the arrival rate of specific attacks ( i.e. , attack - centric rather than computer / network - centric ) .",
    "moreover , the framework in principle could model and predict the emergence of new attacks ( e.g. , zero - day exploits ) , assuming the data exhibits lrd or other relevant statistical properties that can be exploited for predicting the emergence of new attacks ( e.g. , the probability that a zero - day attack will arrive at a honeypot , assuming that the data indeed contains new or zero - day attacks ) .",
    "although we do not have access to high - interaction honeypot data , there would be researchers / practitioners who have access to such data .",
    "this explains why we are automating our analysis methodology , and will release the software package so that other researchers / practitioners can use our software package as is , or can enhance it to incorporate more analysis methods to better serve their purposes .",
    "third , the framework can be adapted to describe attacks against production networks / computers , because identifying statistical properties of the traffic would allow the defender to detect anomalies .",
    "for example , suppose the traffic during the past days does not exhibit lrd property ( or any other relevant statistical property ) but the traffic today exhibits lrd property , then this hints possible attacks today .",
    "suppose further that a firewall is installed to filter out the known attacks against the production networks / computers .",
    "then the change in statistical properties exhibited by the traffic hints the presence of new ( possibly zero - day ) attacks against the production networks / computers .",
    "these hints serve as clues for further forensics examinations .",
    "note that for further forensics examination of the actually attacks , we need the detailed information about the traffic . such information is not captured by low - interaction honeypots , but can be captured by high - interaction honeypots and production defense systems .",
    "this explains the limitation of our case study , although the limitation is not inherent to our framework ( as it is imposed by the specific dataset collected by low - interaction honeypot ) .",
    "fourth , consider the scenario that the honeypot ip addresses are randomly scattered into a production network ( rather than being allocated to a consecutive chunk of ip addresses )",
    ". this would be the ideal scenario for deploying honeypots , because it can be hard for the attacker to figure out which ip addresses are the honeypot ip addresses .",
    "this is true especially when the honeypot ip addresses are shuffled frequently and randomly and when the honeypot is a high - interaction one . in this case , the attacks arrive at the honeypot ip addresses would be comparable to the attacks that arrive at the production ip addresses .",
    "the attacks arrive at the honeypot ip addresses can be equally investigated using the framework presented in the paper .",
    "this means that we can predict the arrival rate of the attacks that will come to the honeypot ip addresses possibly hours ahead of time .",
    "this also means that we can expect the rate of attacks that will arrive at the production ip addresses hours ahead of time .",
    "when the predicted attack rate is high , the defender would need to provision more defense resources to inspect the packets that target the production ip addresses ( e.g. , for deep packet inspection ) .",
    "the prediction capability gives the defender early - warning that possibly intensive attacks will arrive in the near future .",
    "this kind of early - warning capability is desired for real - life defense .",
    "furthermore , the above discussion equally applies to the case that known attacks have been filtered out by firewalls , meaning that the prediction can be with respect to unknown ( i.e. , new or zero - day ) attacks .",
    "we discuss the related prior work from several perspectives . in terms of analyzing honeypot - captured cyber attack data ,",
    "there have been at least two complementary approaches .",
    "one approach is to visualize cyber attack data , such as using neural projection techniques to visualize the ports observed in honeypot data @xcite .",
    "however , the widely used approach is statistical analysis . within this approach ,",
    "existing studies mainly focused on the following aspects : ( i ) analyzing attackers probing activities @xcite ; ( ii ) grouping attacks ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( iii ) characterizing internet threats @xcite such as fitting the attack inter - arrival time via a mixture of pareto and exponential distributions .",
    "these studies are often based on flow - level processing of data , so do we in this paper .",
    "in contrast to these studies , we systematically study the identification , exploitation and cause of statistical properties exhibited by honeypot data , such as lrd that is shown to be exhibited by honeypot data for the first time in the present paper . to our knowledge ,",
    "our framework is the first formal statistical analysis of honeypot - captured cyber attack data . in particular , our study of predicting cyber attacks ( in terms of attack rate ) would represent a significant step toward the ultimate goal of quantitatively understanding / predicting cyber attacks .    in terms of using honeypots to improve defense",
    ", we note that honeypots have been used to help detect various attacks including dos ( denial - of - service ) @xcite , worms @xcite , botnets @xcite , internet - messaging threats @xcite , generating attack signatures @xcite , and detecting targeted attacks @xcite .",
    "these studies are important , but are orthogonal to the focus of the present paper .    in terms of the lrd phenomenon , we note that lrd was first observed in benign traffic about two decades ago and there has been a large body of literature on this topic ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there have been studies on the effect of injecting abnormal events ( which are not necessarily attacks ) into benign traffics that exhibit lrd .",
    "the injection of abnormal events may disrupt the lrd exhibited by the benign traffic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there also have been studies on the effect of injecting attacks into benign traffics that exhibit lrd ( in terms of number of bytes and number of packets ) .",
    "the injection of attack events may not disrupt the lrd ( i.e. , the  blended \" traffics still exhibit lrd ) @xcite . in the setting of spams ,",
    "the correlation co - efficient of inter - arrival time of spams that are sent by a group of spammers may decrease slowly , which hints that the inter - arrival time may exhibit lrd @xcite  although this was not formally statistically analyzed there .",
    "in contrast to all the studies mentioned above , we investigate lrd exhibited by _ attack rate _ via rigorous statistical methods : auto - correlation serves as a hint of possible lrd , hurst parameters serves as the first rigorous step of examining lrd , and non - stationarity analysis eliminates spurious lrds . to our knowledge , we are the first to report that lrd is exhibited by honeypot - captured cyber attack data .    putting data - driven analysis of cyber attacks into a broader context",
    ", we note that there have been studies on characterizing blackhole - collected traffic data ( e.g. , @xcite ) or one - way traffic in live networks @xcite .",
    "still , there are no advanced statistical framework for analyzing such blackhole or one - way traffic data .",
    "more specifically , these studies differ from ours in ( i ) honeypot - captured cyber attack data includes two - way communications , whereas blackhole - collected data mainly corresponds to one - way communications ; ( ii ) we rigorously explore statistical properties such as lrd , whereas their studies do not pursue such rigorous statistical analysis .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that our analysis framework can be adapted to analyze blackhole data .",
    "we introduced the novel concept of stochastic cyber attack process , which offers a new perspective for studying cyber attacks and , in particular , can be instantiated at multiple resolutions such as network - level , victim - level and port - level .",
    "we then proposed a statistical framework that is centered on identifying , exploiting ( for  gray - box \" prediction ) and exploring ( for cause analysis ) the advanced statistical properties of stochastic cyber attack processes . in order to demonstrate use of the framework",
    ", we applied it to analyze some low - interaction honeypot data .",
    "the findings of the case study include : ( i ) majority of the attack processes exhibit lrd ; ( ii ) lrd - aware models can predict the attack rates ( especially for network - level attack processes ) even 5 hours ahead of time , which would give the defender sufficient early - warning time . the prediction power of the  gray - box \" prediction models , when compared with ",
    "black - box \" prediction models , rewards the effort spent for analyzing the advanced statistical properties of stochastic cyber attack processes .",
    "the present study introduces a range of interesting problems for future research .",
    "first , we need to further improve the prediction accuracy , despite that the lrd - aware farima model can predict better than the lrd - less arma models .",
    "for this purpose , we plan to study some advanced models that can accommodate high volatilities .",
    "it is known in the literature that garch model may be able to accommodate high volatilities , which has some correlation to lrd .",
    "this hints that farima+garch models may be able to fit and predict the attack rates better .",
    "the other possible way to improve prediction is to incorporate the extreme value theory into the farima process because the farima process may not be able to capture the extremely large attack rate ( i.e. , the spikes ) .",
    "second , although our study only ruled out two candidate causes , it is important to rigorously explain the fundamental cause of lrd as exhibited by honeypot - captured cyber attacks .",
    "this is a difficult problem in general .",
    "third , the victim - level attack processes and network - level attack processes exhibit similar phenomena ( i.e. , lrd ) .",
    "this hints a sort of _ scale - invariance _ that , if turns out to hold , would have extremely important implications ( for example ) in achieving scalable analysis of cyber attacks .",
    "fourth , wagener et al .",
    "@xcite recently introduced the concept of adaptive high - interaction honeypots to interact with the attacker strategically , which is reminiscent of @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to characterize the statistical properties of such new variants of honeypots .",
    "fifth , one reviewer points out the following interesting research problem : can we use the information about the prediction errors to directly adjust the prediction results ? in order to answer this question ,",
    "we need to study the statistical properties of the prediction errors .",
    "this study was irb - approved .",
    "we thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments that helped us improve the paper .",
