    "when the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ used the bright x - ray quasar pks 0637 - 752 to focus its mirror assembly during its first observation , astronomers expected to detect a bright x - ray point source .",
    "however , in addition to the bright core of the quasar , _ chandra _ detected significant x - ray emission from the previously detected quasar radio jet @xcite . this bright x - ray emission was found to overproduce the x - ray flux that corresponds to the extension of the radio - optical spectrum to x - ray energies , arguing for a second spectral component , for which the most plausible candidate was initially thought to be synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) emission .",
    "however , it became immediately apparent from modeling the multi - wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the knots of pks 0637 - 752 that the expected ssc x - ray flux in equipartition conditions severely underpredicts the observed x - ray flux , with the case for ssc only getting worse when relativistic beaming effects are considered @xcite .    following the discovery of the x - ray jet of pks 0637 - 752 , there has been extensive observational and theoretical work on powerful quasar jets ( for a recent review see harris & krawczynski 2006 ) .",
    "further x - ray studies using _ chandra _ have confirmed that bright x - ray emitting jets are common among radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies ( e.g. sambruna et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 , 2006 ; marshall et al .",
    "2005 ; siemiginowska et al .",
    "2002 ; kataoka et al . 2003 ; jorstad et al . 2004 ; cheung , stawarz , & siemiginowska 2006 ; schwartz et al .",
    "they also confirmed that in these jets the x - ray emission is a spectral component separate from the radio optical synchrotron emission , with the x - ray flux being higher that that anticipated by simply extending the radio - optical spectrum to x - ray energies .",
    "a plausible candidate for the x - ray emission mechanism was suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors argued that the x - ray flux of the knots of pks 0637 - 752 is due to external compton emission from jet relativistic electrons in equipartition with the magnetic field of the jet , up - scattering cosmic microwave background photons ( ec / cmb ) .",
    "the model , modivated by the superluminal motions observed in the sub - pc scale jet @xcite , requires that ( i ) the large scale jet is significantly beamed ( bulk lorentz factor @xmath0 ) and ( ii ) the electron distribution has a low energy break or cutoff at @xmath1 . both these requirements increase the required jet power uncomfortably close to the eddington limit @xcite . because in the ec / cmb model",
    "the x - rays are produced by very low energy electrons ( @xmath2 ) , these electrons have long cooling times that allow them to reach the terminal points of even megaparsec scale jets without losing a significant fraction of their energy .",
    "thus , in the ec / cmb we would expect to see continuous x - ray emission throughout the jet instead of the knotty x - ray structure we usually observe .",
    "a possible solution to this issue is to assume that jets are not continuous and that the x - ray knots are ejected from the central engine during periods of high activity and retain their knot structure as they propagate downstream .",
    "also , in several x - ray jets , the ratio of the radio to x - ray flux in the knots decreases as we move away from the core . in the context of the ec / cmb model this can be explained if jets gradually decelerate @xcite . in some jets , including pks 0637 - 752 , there is a low emission bridge of @xmath3 arcsec connecting the quasar core to the first jet knot .",
    "@xcite argued that , in the context of the ec / cmb model , this can be used to constrain the matter content of the jet through ir observations of the bridge , and @xcite used this to show , through _ spitzer _ observations of pks 0637 - 752 , that an electron - positron jet is not favored if the x - rays are due to the ec / cmb mechanism .    the fact that the ec / cmb model requires bulk lorentz factors much in excess than required by jet - to - counter - jet radio asymmetry arguments ( e.g. arshakian & longair 2004 ) , together with the issues just discussed , raises the possibility that the x - rays are of synchrotron nature ( e.g. review by harris & krawczynski 2006 ) by an additional population of very high energy ( @xmath4 tev ) electrons .",
    "such high energy electrons may be produced if the jet is characterized by velocity shear @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the decay of a collimated neutron beam produced in the sub - pc scale jet can provide a second high energy electron component @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron option is viable for sources such as 3c 273 , for which the high energy component extends smoothly down to optical energies @xcite , but runs into difficulties for sources like pks 0637 - 752 , in which the high energy component cuts off before the optical regime , because these high energy electrons would cool rapidly to lower energies and would radiate in the optical , producing , thereby , a much higher optical flux than observed . if , indeed , the x - ray emission is of synchrotron nature , the multi tev electrons responsible for it will unavoidably up - scatter the cmb photons to tev energies @xcite . for 3c 273 ,",
    "the upper limit from shallow hess tev observations is compatible with the synchrotron interpretation , provided @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the usual doppler factor .    here",
    "we present hst nicmos and acs observations of pks 0637 - 752 , and discuss the constraints they pose , together with available multiwavelength observations , on our understanding of the jet physics .",
    "in  [ obs ] we present the data reduction procedure , in  [ results ] our observational results , together with existing multiwavelength observations , in  [ discussion ] the constraints on the jet physics , and in  [ conclusions ] our conclusions .",
    "pks 0637 - 752 ( @xmath7 , luminosity distance @xmath8 mpc ) has been observed in different energy bands by other researchers .",
    "here we use the 8.6 ghz radio observations taken with the australian telescope compact array ( lovell et al . 2000 ) , the spitzer observations by uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the hst wfpc 2 observations by schwartz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and the chandra x - ray observations by chartas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and schwartz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "our hst observations took place on november 15th and 16th 2005 using the acs and nicmos instruments respectively .",
    "the data were processed by the standard `` on - the - fly '' reprocessing calibration pipeline .",
    "we performed subsequent data reduction using the noao image reduction analysis facility ( iraf ) and python iraf ( pyraf ) packages .",
    "the acs data was taken using filter f475w and the wide field channel ( wfc ) detector which has a pivot wavelength of 0.4744 @xmath9 m with a field of view of 202  x 202  , corresponding to a resolution of 0.05 arcsecond / pixel .",
    "the total exposure time was 2556s .",
    "this data was reduced using the standard `` multidrizzle '' script which completes all the data reduction and dithering tasks .",
    "these tasks include : creating a bad pixel map , sky subtraction , drizzling the data onto separate output images , combining the output images into a median image , blotting or undrizzling the combined image , creating a cosmic ray mask by comparing the blotted image to the original images and drizzling all the images onto a final mosaic using the bad pixel and cosmic ray masks .",
    "the nicmos data was taken using the nic3 camera using filter f160w with a pivot wavelength of 1.604 @xmath9 m .",
    "the field of view of nic3 camera is 51.2  x 51.2  with a resolution of 0.2/pixel .",
    "although it has a lower angular resolution , we used the nic3 camera instead of the nic1 or nic2 as the nic3 camera has larger pixels which would help us detect any faint , extended emission from the cold electrons in the jet .",
    "the nicmos observations were split into 3 orbits each with an exposure time of 3072s .",
    "orbits 2 and 3 were shifted by 5 and 10 pixels respectively .",
    "this enables us to detect hot pixels and other ccd defects easily . in the nicmos data , we come across some important anomalies such as the pedestal effect and bad pixels which are not corrected for by multidrizzle .",
    "the pedestal effect is corrected for by `` pedsub '' , hot pixels were replaced by the average value of the surrounding pixels using the `` imedit '' task .",
    "we could not use the `` multidrizzle '' task as it does not account for the pedestal effect and tended to oversubtract the sky for the nicmos data .",
    "the compensation was done using tasks from the `` dither '' package in iraf .",
    "these tasks included sky subtraction , drizzling the data with corrections for geometric and other distortions by the ccd , correcting for the shifts in images from the 3 orbits and rotating the image to show north up and east left .",
    "the radio jet ( 8.6 ghz , taken with the australian telescope compact array ; lovell et al . 2000 ) , shown by the contours in figure [ fig : maps ] , shows a bright jet extending to @xmath10 from the quasar core , then bending north - west .",
    "there is also a counter jet radio feature approximately @xmath11 east of the core and at least 2 knots between @xmath12 and @xmath13 west of the core with possible features further in .",
    "chandra _ x - ray image @xcite shows at least 3 x - ray knots , wk 5.7 , wk 7.8 , wk 8.9 and possibly a fourth knot wk 9.7 .",
    "previous hst observations ( wfpc2 , f702w ) at an effective wavelength @xmath14 m @xcite detect the three knots wk 5.7 , wk 7.8 , wk 8.9 .",
    "there was also a deeper by a factor of @xmath15 2 stis hst observation ( pi c. m. urry , cycle 10 ) practically at the same effective wavelength .",
    "the infrared ( _ spitzer _ ) jet @xcite is aligned well with the x - ray and radio jet and shows 2 bright knots : wk 7.8 and wk 8.9 .",
    "however , the resolution of _ spitzer _ makes it difficult to distinguish these knots clearly .",
    "there is no evidence of the jet after the bend or the counter jet radio feature in the _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ data .    from both the acs and nicmos images ,",
    "we see the bright quasar core and the three bright knots wk 7.8 , wk 8.9 and wk 9.7 separately , with wk 8.9 being the brightest knot . in the nicmos image",
    ", we also see the inner knot wk 5.7 , which was only seen in x - rays before , and we obtain limits from nicmos and acs for the counter jet radio feature .",
    "due to the lower spatial resolution of the nic3 camera , there is contamination from a background galaxy from the south in the wk 8.9 knot ( this galaxy is also seen on the acs image ) .",
    "the host galaxy contamination is accounted for by subtracting the galaxy flux scaled by the ratio of the two areas from the raw flux .",
    "the higher resolution of the acs camera helps prevent such contamination in the acs image .    the optical jet is well aligned with the radio , x - ray , and infrared jet .",
    "we do not detect the jet after the bend and the counter jet radio feature in both the acs and nicmos images .",
    "with acs we see that wk 7.8 and wk 8.9 are well confined bright knots whereas wk 9.7 seems to be extended in the north - west direction .",
    "we also detect with nicmos a perviously undetected feature along the jet between wk 5.7 and wk 7.8 .",
    "this new feature ( wk 6.3 ) is approximately @xmath16 from the core and is the least bright feature from all the knots or features we detect .",
    "both wk 5.7 and wk 6.3 are enveloped by the same radio feature , and could not have been resolved by the spitzer observations .",
    "for this reason , and to allow direct comparison with uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in the rest of the paper we use the same size they used for the wk 5.7 knot , which includes the wk 6.3 feature .",
    "it is interesting to note that even though the brightest pixels in nicmos do fall within the radio knots , there are parts of knots that lie slightly outside the contours .",
    "this may suggest a slight shift in the overall knot position between the optical and radio knots .",
    "the higher resolution acs knots , however , fall well within the radio contours .",
    "the seds for the four knots ( wk 5.7 , 7.8 , 8.9 and 9.7 ) are shown in figure [ fig : f_knot_seds ] .",
    "we see that all the knots have the same basic shape of dropping significantly in the optical before brightening in the x - rays .",
    "the three near ir - optical points ( nicmos , wfpc2 and acs ) are interesting as they are the interface between the radio to optical component and the optical to x - rays component of the sed .",
    "an interesting question is if in the tail of the optical component one can discern the rise of the new component that eventually produces the x - rays . for knot 8.9",
    ", there is no evidence for this , as we see the point - to - point slopes between the three points drop . knot wk 7.8 shows an interesting trend near the acs point . the point to point slopes between the nicmos - wfpc2 points and the wfpc2-acs points are beyond @xmath17 of each other : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "however , the probability of the three points falling on a line , using the @xmath20 test , is 0.15 .",
    "thus , knot 7.8 shows suggestive , but not conclusive evidence of an additional component in the acs frequency range .",
    "knot 9.7 clearly shows the presence of an additional component as the acs flux is approximately the same as the wfpc2 flux .",
    "interestingly , we see that the brightest knot shows the least evidence for this component while the least bright knot gives a strong evidence for the same .",
    "the sed for the total western jet and the sed for the counter jet radio feature are shown in figure [ fig : counterjet ] .",
    "the flux of the total jet is calculated by adding up all the definitive fluxes from the 4 knots ( wk 5.7 , 7.8 , 8.9 , 9.7 ) .",
    "the fluxes with limits were ignored so as to obtain a lower limit on the total jet flux .",
    "the complete list of fluxes is given in table [ tab : fluxes ] .",
    "a possibility mentioned in  [ intro ] is that the x - ray emission for knots with a broadband sed similar to that of knot wk 7.8 , in which the x - rays are part of a separate spectral component , is of synchrotron nature @xcite . a typical one zone synchrotron model in which the electron distribution is regulated by injection , radiative losses , and escape runs into difficulties because the x - ray emitting electrons have a cooling time significantly faster than their escape time . the observed x - ray spectral index @xmath21 requires an electron energy distribution ( eed ) that locally is a power law @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "because these multi - tev energy electrons are in the fast cooling regime , the acceleration mechanism that produced them is required to provide an eed @xmath24 .",
    "such hard eeds are far from the usual 2 - 2.3 index of shock acceleration @xcite , although an index of @xmath25 is within the wide range anticipated in different acceleration scenaria ( e.g. ostrowski 2008 ) .",
    "a more serious issue with one zone models is the fact that the level of the observed optical - uv emission is very low compared to the extrapolation of the x - ray emission in the optical .",
    "this is not expected , because radiative cooling should have extended the high energy electron population to lower energies , and these lower energy electrons would fill with their synchrotron emission the optical - uv `` valley '' .",
    "two - zone synchrotron models can be devised , at the cost of practically doubling the free parameters . in two - zone models where the acceleration of the x - ray emitting particles takes place in a separate zone",
    ", the optical `` valley '' forces us to adopt an ad - hoc injection of electrons at @xmath26 tev energies which are then accelerated up to at least @xmath27 tev before they escape .",
    "this population of electrons must then escape to an environment of much lower magnetic field , so that these electrons will not produce substantial optical - uv synchrotron emission as they cool .",
    "as proposed by @xcite , the fact that the ir emission of the ` bridge ' , the part of the jet interior to knot wk 7.8 , is very low can be used to derive constraints for the lepton power carried by the jet , under the assumption that the jet power in the bridge is carried by some combination of protons and leptons and that the jet flow is not episodic .",
    "the idea behind the bridge diagnostic is that even if the electrons are cold ( @xmath28 ) in the bulk flow frame , they will up - scatter the cmb to higher energies due to their bulk motion .",
    "the power in the lepton beam is then constrained by the requirement that the bulk compton ( bc ) emission should not overproduce the upper limits of the bridge emission .",
    "furthermore , the cold lepton power constraints can be used in the context of the ec / emb model for the non - thermal knot emission to constrain the jet matter content : a knot configuration that successfully produces the knots sed will be incompatible with an electron - positron jet if the lepton power required to be fed into the knot exceeds the bc upper limit on the power carried by leptons in the bridge .",
    "this was applied by @xcite on pks 0637 - 752 using spitzer observations to argue that , in the context of the ec / cmb model , the three jet configurations they considered are incompatible with an electron - positron jet , because the power required to be fed into the knot exceeds the upper limit of the power carried by leptons .",
    "we calculate here the model independent constraints for the cold lepton power , applying the formalism of georganopoulos et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to our @xmath29 m nicmos data of wk 5.7 , as well as the spitzer data at @xmath30 m and @xmath31 m ( as it turns out , shorter wavelengths limits do not constrain the power further as long as the bulk lorentz factor @xmath32 ) . a beam of cold electrons of power @xmath33 that propagates a length @xmath34 with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath35 and velocity @xmath36 through a blackbody photon field characterized by a temperature @xmath37 ,",
    "produces a specific luminosity @xmath38 }           { 1-\\exp[-h\\nu /(\\gamma \\delta \\ , kt(1+\\beta ) ) ] } \\right ] , \\label{app.lum}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the angle between the beam and the line of sight . selecting the knot wk 5.7 , as uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and setting the length to @xmath41 kpc , we require that @xmath42 is smaller than the wk 5.7 knot upper limits and calculate the upper limit for @xmath33 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig : bulk ] for three different angles .",
    "( for @xmath43 the jet becomes longer than 1 mpc ; @xmath44 is in disagreement with the superluminal motions observed in the vlbi core , unless the jet is significantly bend ) , and for a range of @xmath35 .",
    "we see that for a given angle , for @xmath45 , the constraints are relatively flat with increasing @xmath35 , going from from @xmath46 erg s@xmath47 for @xmath48 to @xmath49 erg s@xmath47 for @xmath50 .",
    "if we assume a black hole mass of @xmath51 m@xmath52 , this suggests that for all plausible angles the cold lepton power has to be sub - eddington as long as @xmath53 .",
    "we discuss the implications of these constraints on the ec / cmb model in  [ eccmb ] .",
    "we now turn to the more constrained ec / cmb model , focusing our attention on knot wk 7.8 , which we model as a sphere of radius @xmath54 kpc ( corresponding to an angular diameter of @xmath55 arcsec ) permeated by a magnetic field @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that the eed , at least in the regime responsible for the synchrotron radio and ec / cmb x - rays , is a power law @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the total number of electrons in the source with lorentz factors in the range @xmath59 . using the @xmath60-function , energy - conserving approximations for the synchrotron and ic emissivities , the ec / cmb and synchrotron observed specific luminosity ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively )",
    "can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath60 is the usual doppler factor and @xmath65 are listed in the appendix .",
    "the magnetic field energy density is a fraction @xmath66 of the radiating lepton energy density @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the low energy cutoff of the eed and , in agreement with the radio and x - ray observations , we have assumed @xmath69 .",
    "although equipartition ( @xmath70 ) is widely adopted in the study of jets , there is no physical argument for why the plasma should be in equipartition . here , and in the rest of this work , instead of presuming equipartition , we let @xmath66 be a free parameter and we examine how it can be constrained . for a given value of @xmath66 the above three equations can be solved to provide @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for a given resulting @xmath60 ,",
    "the maximum angle @xmath73 that the jet can form with the line of sight is @xmath74 .",
    "we constrain the jet orientation angle to @xmath75 , with the lower limit set by the requirement that the jet up to knot wk 9.7 is less that 1 mpc long , and the upper limit set by the observed superluminal core speeds @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : f ] , magnetically dominated jets ( @xmath76 ) are excluded , because they require @xmath77 .",
    "jets in which the radiating lepton energy density is increasingly higher than that of the magnetic field require gradually smaller @xmath60 and larger @xmath73 .",
    "we study here the constraints imposed on the plasma composition and lorentz factor of the jet by the requirement that any viable configuration should reproduce the sed of knot wk 7.8 ( hereafter simply called the knot ) and should not be substantially super - eddington .",
    "given that the plasma is not magnetically dominated , we only examine solutions with @xmath78 .",
    "for a given jet orientation angle @xmath40 , there are two possible values of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath35 compatible with a particular @xmath60 : @xmath79 selecting three representative angles ( @xmath80 ) , we let @xmath66 vary , and for each @xmath66 we calculate @xmath60 and @xmath56 . for each value of @xmath60",
    "we calculate the two possible values of @xmath35 . a constraint on @xmath35",
    "can be imposed by the requirement that the electrons responsible for the radio emission escape from the knot before they have time to cool , as suggested by the overall sed of the knots and from the fact that the radio spectrum of the knots has a spectral index @xmath81 that corresponds to an eed electron index of @xmath82 , typical of uncooled electrons in radio sources .",
    "the requirement that cooling does not affect the radio frequencies can be written as @xmath83 hz , where the cooling frequency is @xmath84 ^ 2 { b \\delta \\over 1+z } ,   \\label{cooling}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 being the escape time from the source in units of light crossing time ( @xmath85 is in agreement with the jump conditions at highly relativistic shock ; blandford & mckees 1977 ) , @xmath86 the cmb energy density , @xmath87 the thomson cross section and @xmath88 the redshift of the source ( this equation does not take into account synchrotron losses that turn out to be negligible compared to the ec / cmb ones , as can be ssen by the fact that the x - ray luminosity is higher than the radio - optical ) .",
    "we plot the two different @xmath35-branches for each angle at the lower panel of figure [ fig : edd_constr ] , taking into account the above constraint , which , for the range of @xmath66 we consider , only affects the fast @xmath35 branch for @xmath89 ( without this constraint , these upper branches would continue toward higher values of @xmath35 and lower values of @xmath66 .",
    "as can be seen , if we drop the equipartition assumption , a wide range , @xmath90 , can reproduce the x - ray and radio data .",
    "an additional strong constraint comes from the requirement that the sed breaks from the radio slope at @xmath91 hz , peaks at @xmath92 hz , and curves down at ir , optical and uv bands ( uchiyama et al . 2005",
    "; see also  [ sed ] ) .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this break is radiative cooling .",
    "using equation ( [ cooling ] ) for @xmath93 hz , we plot with a solid black line in the lower panel of figure [ fig : edd_constr ] the locus of configurations with @xmath93 hz .",
    "this line intersects the upper @xmath35 branch for all angles .",
    "numerical models that fit the knot sed should cluster around this line ( see  [ sed ] ) . if , however , we choose to interpret the sed not as due to radiative cooling , but rather as due to an injected eed that is intrinsically curved , then all the configurations below the black line are possible .",
    "we now turn to the question of the power required to feed the knot , noting that power requirements significantly higher than the eddington luminosity of a @xmath94 m@xmath52 black hole ( @xmath95 erg s@xmath47 ) are unpleasant , and power requirements higher than the eddington luminosity of a @xmath96 m@xmath52 black hole are disfavored .",
    "the power in radiating leptons and magnetic field required to feed the knots is @xmath97 in the second from the bottom panel of figure [ fig : edd_constr ] , we plot ( green lines ) the jet power required to be fed into the knot in the case of an @xmath98 jet composition for the lower @xmath35-branch ( as we mentioned above these configurations are plausible only if we presume that the shape of the sed is not due to cooling , but rather due to an appropriately fine - tuned intrinsically curving eed ) .",
    "the required power is for all cases below @xmath99 ( the lightly shaded area indicates @xmath100 , while the heavily shaded area indicates @xmath101 ) .",
    "we also plot with red lines the upper limit to the jet power from the constraint that bc emission can not overproduce the flux limits of knot wk 5.7 . as can be seen , the only part of the parameter space that a leptonic configuration is unattainable ( red line lower than green ) and therefore a proton contribution is needed , is for configurations close to equipartition .    in the second from the top panel we plot the same quantities for the upper @xmath35-branch , that includes the more plausible configurations in which the sed shape is due to self - consistent radiative cooling ( black line ) . except for the high @xmath66 tail of large angle models ( in the case depicted , @xmath102 models with @xmath103 ) , the rest of the @xmath98 models",
    "are excluded because they require more power in the knot than allowed by the upper limit set by the bc constraints ( red lines below blue lines ) .",
    "this means that these models are viable only if protons carry a power at least equal to the difference between that required by the knot and that carried by the cold leptons in the bridge .",
    "note that large angles are disfavored because @xmath104 .",
    "a particular @xmath105 jet is one in which for every radiating lepton there is a cold proton .",

    "the only configurations that have @xmath108 are those at equipartition and , consequently , small angle .      to confirm that models on or close to the black lines of figure [ fig : edd_constr ] provide reasonable representations of the knot sed , we present in figure [ fig : sed ] the results of three simulationsmarkos / cs _ ] at angles @xmath80 .",
    "for each angle , we select a corresponding @xmath109 , and from these two parameters we calculate the rest of the model parameters from equations ( [ eq : lslec ] ) , ( [ eq : lb ] ) , ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , and ( [ eq : lept ] ) ( see table [ tab : models ] ) . we also plot in figure [ fig : edd_constr ] with solid circles the location of the models .",
    "all three models provide adequate representations of the sed and are , therefore , equally acceptable .",
    "as expected , all three models are located close to the black line of @xmath93 hz .",
    "also , all three models require protons to carry some ( @xmath102 ) or most ( @xmath89 ) of the power . only the model close to equipartition ( @xmath110 ) , however , can have one proton per radiating particle and still be sub - eddington",
    ".      having exhausted the constraints that can be imposed on the jet physics in the context of the ec / cmb model , we now present a rather model independent argument that the jet of pks 0637 - 752 is characterized by a fast spine emitting most of the ir to x - ray emission , and a slow sheath emitting most of the radio .",
    "the first direct observational argument that a radio jes may be characterized by a fast spine and a slower sheath came from radio observations of the several - kpc radio jets of the fr ii radio galaxy 3c 353 by @xcite , who interpreted the apparently lower emissivity along the jet axis as doppler de - beamed radiation from a spine with plasma flow velocities faster than those of the sheath .",
    "similar arguments , based on radio observations of the kpc jet of the fr i radio galaxy 3c 264 and on the pc jet of the fr i radio galaxy m87 , were presented by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "a comprehensive multiwavelength study of the kpc scale jet of m87 @xcite shows stratification in the high energy radiation production , in the sense that effective particle acceleration capable of producing the observed infrared to x - ray synchrotron emission of m87 is concentrated along the spine of the jet .",
    "a recent study of the jets centaurus a shows similar results , in the sense that the x - ray spectrum of the jet knots is harder along the spine @xcite .    a model - independent argument for a spine - sheath geometry in the jet of pks 0637 - 752 , with the spine both ( _ i _ ) being faster and ( _ ii _ ) emitting most of the ir to x - ray emission , can be constructed on the basis of multiwavelength observations and on the assumption that the quasar has two jets of similar power .",
    "this assumption is supported by the fact that in radio galaxies and quasars , the level of the presumably non - beamed radio emission from the two lobes is comparable ( e.g. perley , rser , meisenheimer 1997 ) .",
    "the morphology of the western jet strongly suggests that the x - ray knots are part of the jet and not termination shocks .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that the western knot complex magnetic field orientation , determined by radio polarization measurements @xcite , is parallel to the jet axis and not perpendicular , as one would expect from strong perpendicular shocks , typically found at the terminal hot spots .",
    "radio observations @xcite show a radio feature diametrically opposite and at approximately the same distance from the core as the complex of the three knots wk 7.8 , wk 8.9 , and wk 9.7 .",
    "interestingly , the same parallel to the jet axis magnetic field orientation is observed at the eastern jet radio feature , suggesting that this is also not a terminal hotspot , and that the jet plasma flows through the radio feature .",
    "assuming that the two jets are intrinsically symmetric , the ratio @xmath111 of the jet to counter jet radio fluxes ( see figure [ fig : counterjet ] and table [ tab : fluxes ] ) constrains the radio plasma speed @xmath112 to be @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the radio spectral index , and @xmath40 the jet orientation to the line of sight .",
    "if the ir to x - ray emitting plasma had the same velocity as the radio , one would expect a clear detection of the counter jet in the ir to x - ray range .",
    "however , this is not the case and using the limit @xmath115 for the jet to counter jet x - ray ratio one obtains @xmath116 .",
    "the speed , therefore , of the x - ray emitting plasma must be significantly higher than that of the radio plasma .",
    "similar , but somewhat lower speed constraints can be derived using the ir and optical ratio limits .",
    "we present new nicmos and acs observations , which we use , together with existing broadband observations to build the most complete sed of the jet knots of quasar pks 0637 - 752 .",
    "we relax the equipartition assumption and show that in the ec / cmb framework for the x - ray emission , the plausible requirement that the @xmath13 jet is at most 1 mpc long excludes magnetically dominated jets .",
    "we also show that limits on the bc emission exclude @xmath98 jets in the ec / cmb framework , regardless of equipartition : the jet needs to carry some , or most of its power with protons .",
    "interestingly , if we require one proton per radiation lepton , only the equipartition jet does not require substantially super - eddington power .",
    "taking radiative cooling into account , the lorentz factor @xmath117 required to model the knot sed for the equipartition solution is significantly higher that those used previously , and is more in agreement with the radio core limit @xmath118 , derived from core superluminal motions @xcite .",
    "configurations with significantly more than one protons per radiating lepton are excluded in the ec / cmb model .",
    "finally , we note that the counter jet radio feature and its polarization , together with the limits on the ir - optical and x - ray emission , suggest a spine sheath flow , with most of the ir - optical - x - ray emission coming from the spine .",
