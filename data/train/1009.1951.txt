    "if supersymmetry exists at the tev scale and r - parity is conserved , the susy particles should be produced in pairs and decay to the lightest susy particle which would escape detection , thus leading to signatures containing jets , large missing transverse momentum and potentially one or more leptons .",
    "we present here a first comparison of the atlas data corresponding to @xmath0 of integrated luminosity from the @xmath1 tev proton - proton collisions to monte carlo simulations for some of the most important kinematical variables that are expected to be sensitive for susy searches .",
    "a more detailed description of these results can be found in @xcite .",
    "in the one - lepton analysis , after a leptonic trigger requirement and a set of cleaning cuts to reject events containing jets which are consistent with calorimeter noise , cosmic rays or out - of - time energy deposits , the events are preselected by asking for at least two jets with transverse momentum @xmath2 gev and one isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) with @xmath3 gev .",
    "the signal region is then defined by applying two further cuts : @xmath4 gev and @xmath5 gev , where @xmath6 is the missing transverse momentum , calculated as the opposite of the vector sum of the transverse energies of all three - dimensional topological clusters in the calorimeter plus the transverse momenta of the selected well - isolated muons in the analysis and @xmath7 is the transverse mass of the lepton and @xmath6 defined as @xmath8 .    the data is compared to the full - detector geant4 simulation which is reconstructed using the same algorithms as for the data .",
    "the standard model background processes considered in this analysis are qcd ( pythia ) , w / z+jets ( alpgen + herwig + jimmy ) and @xmath9 ( mc@nlo + herwig + jimmy ) .",
    "the pythia qcd predictions were compared to a set of alpgen qcd samples ; the differences were found to be well within the experimental uncertainties for the kinematic region explored .",
    "the qcd and w+jets backgrounds are normalized to the data in control regions defined as @xmath10 gev and @xmath11 gev for the qcd background and @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev for the w+jets background . as an example",
    ", the su4 supersymmetric point ( isajet + herwig + prospino ) is also shown in the plots with its cross section multiplied by 10 ; su4 is a low - mass benchmark point close to the tevatron limits and is defined as @xmath14 gev , @xmath15 gev , @xmath16 gev , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the most important sources of systematic uncertainties are considered : the uncertainty on the jet energy scale ( which varies from 7 - 10@xmath19 as a function of the jet @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , the uncertainty on the w+jets and qcd normalizations ( 50@xmath19 ) , the uncertainty on the z+jets normalization ( 60@xmath19 ) and the uncertainty on the luminosity ( 11@xmath19 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : met]-[fig : meff ] .",
    "figure [ fig : met ] shows @xmath6 after the preselection for the electron and muon channels : there is reasonable agreement between the data and the monte carlo .",
    "while the low @xmath6 region is dominated by the qcd background , the w+jets background dominates at higher values ; the supersymmetry model would yield even higher @xmath6 values .",
