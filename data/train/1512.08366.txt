    "propositional entailment problem is a fundamental issue in artificial intelligence due to its high complexity .",
    "determining whether a query logically follows from a given knowledge base is intractable @xcite in general as every known algorithm runs in time exponential in the size of the given knowledge base . to overcome such computational intractability , the propositional entailment problem is split into two phases such as off - line and on - line . in the off - line phase",
    ", the original knowledge base @xmath0 is compiled into a new knowledge base @xmath6 and in on - line phase queries are actually answered from the new knowledge base in time polynomial in their size . in such type of compilation",
    "most of the computational overhead shifted into the off - line phase , is amortized over large number of on - line query answering .",
    "the off - line computation is called _",
    "knowledge compilation_.    several approaches of knowledge compilation in propositional logic , first order logic and modal logic has been suggested so far in literature @xcite .",
    "the first kind of approach consists of an equivalence preserving knowledge compilation .",
    "in such an approach , the knowledge base @xmath0 is compiled into another equivalent knowledge base @xmath7 , called the prime implicates of @xmath0 with respect to which queries are answered from @xmath7 in polynomial time . in another approach to equivalence preserving compilation in propositional logic , marquis suggested the computation of theory prime implicates @xcite of a knowledge base @xmath0 with respect to another knowledge base @xmath2 , so that queries can be answered from theory prime implicates in polynomial time .    most of the work in knowledge compilation have been restricted to propositional logic and first order logic in spite of an increasing intrest in modal logic . due to lack of expressive power in propositional logic and the undecidability of first order logic , modal logic is required as a knowledge representation language in many problems .",
    "modal logic gives a trade - off between expressivity and complexity as they are more expressive than propositional logic and computationally better behaved than first order logic .",
    "an algorithm to compute the set of prime implicates of modal logic @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite respectively .    in @xcite ,",
    "the notion of prime implicates is generalized to theory prime implicates in propositional logic where the size of theory prime implicate compilation of a knowledge base is always exponentially smaller than the size of its prime implicate compilation .",
    "moreover , query answering from theory prime implicate compilation can be performed in time polynomial in their size . in this paper",
    "we extend this concept from propositional to modal logic using the algorithm in @xcite .",
