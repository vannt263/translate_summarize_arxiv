    "the presence of vacuum fluctuations is a remarkable property of quantum field theory . in quantum electrodynamics",
    "these fluctuations are responsible of many observable effects such as casimir and casimir - polder forces @xcite .",
    "they are long - range electromagnetic interactions between neutral objects such as atoms / molecules or macroscopic bodies .",
    "these interactions are related to the properties of the vacuum state of the electromagnetic field , in particular to the fact that vacuum field fluctuations may polarize the atoms or exert a pressure on macroscopic bodies , and thus induce electromagnetic interactions .",
    "recently , casimir forces have been measured with remarkable precision for different topologies @xcite .",
    "the atom - wall casimir - polder force has also been measured with precision @xcite , and a good agreement with theoretical predictions has been obtained .    in this paper",
    "we consider the casimir - polder force between an atom and a perfectly conducting plate in a dynamical ( i.e. time - dependent ) situation .",
    "recent papers have given special attention on the problem of time - dependent casimir - polder forces between two or more atoms or dynamical casimir forces between macroscopic objects @xcite .",
    "current experiments are trying to detect the real photons emitted in the dynamical casimir effect @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the dynamical casimir - polder force arising between a perfectly conducting plate and an initially bare ground - state atom during its dynamical self - dressing .",
    "we obtain an analytical expression of the time - dependent casimir - polder force , which is characterized by a timescale corresponding to the time taken by the field emitted by the atom to go back to the atomic position , after reflection on the conducting plate .",
    "this is physically sound , because after this time the interaction of the atom with the ( reflected ) reaction field starts .",
    "we also find that the dynamical casimir - polder force can be attractive or repulsive according to time and atom - wall distance ( on the contrary , the stationary casimir - polder force for a ground - state atom is attractive for any atom - wall separation @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian describing our system in the multipolar coupling scheme and solve the relevant heisenberg equations for atomic and field operators . in section [ sec:3 ] we discuss a method for obtaining the stationary atom - wall casimir - polder energy and force , which is then generalized to the time - dependent case that is the main subject of the paper . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we also discuss the results obtained and their physical interpretation , as well as possible future developments .",
    "we consider a two - level atom in front of an infinitely extended and perfectly conducting wall placed at @xmath0 . in the multipolar coupling scheme and within dipole approximation ,",
    "our system is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath1    @xmath2\\\\ & \\times({s_{+}}{a_{\\mathbf{k}j}}+{s_{-}}{a_{\\mathbf{k}j}}-{s_{+}}{a^{\\dag}_{\\mathbf{k}j}}-{s_{-}}{a^{\\dag}_{\\mathbf{k}j } } ) \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the transition frequency between the atomic levels and @xmath4 are the field mode functions evaluated at the atomic position @xmath5 , that take into account the presence of the wall .",
    "@xmath6 are the pseudo - spin operators of the two - level atom , and @xmath7 is its electric dipole moment operator .    in the presence of an infinite perfectly conducting wall placed at @xmath0 ,",

    "we need expressions of field and atomic operators in the heisenberg representation .",
    "thus we can write the heisenberg equations for atomic and field operators , and solve them iteratively at the lowest significant order .",
    "after straightforward algebra , we obtain the following expressions for the heisenberg operators relevant for the calculations in section [ sec:3 ]    @xmath10\\\\ & { s_{+}}^{(1)}(t)=-2{s_{z}}(0 ) e^{i{\\omega_{0}}t}{\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}j}}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi{\\omega_k}}{\\hbar v}}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\mu$}\\cdot{\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{k}j,\\mathbf{r})})\\left[{a_{\\mathbf{k}j}}(0 ) f^*({\\omega_{0}}+{\\omega_k},t)-{a^{\\dag}_{\\mathbf{k}j}}(0 ) f({\\omega_k}-{\\omega_{0}},t)\\right ] \\end{split}\\ ] ]    ( the superscripts indicate the perturbative order ) , where we have introduced the auxiliary function @xmath11",
    "in order to obtain the dynamical casimir - polder force , let us first consider the stationary case . in this case",
    ", the atom - wall potential energy for a ground state atom is obtained from the second - order energy shift @xmath12 of the bare ground state @xmath13 ( field in the vacuum state and atom in its ground state ) due to the atom - field interaction , calculated by perturbation theory .",
    "the force is then obtained as minus the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the atom - wall distance @xmath14 @xmath15 in this quasi - static approach , the atom s translational degrees of freedom are not taken into account . the well - known result for",
    "an isotropic two - level atom is @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the auxiliary functions of the sine and cosine integral functions @xcite .",
    "this force is negative for any atom - wall distance @xmath14 , yielding an attractive force , and behaves as @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( near zone ) and as @xmath21 for @xmath22 ( far zone ) @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show , independently from the explicit form of @xmath23 , that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the first - order _ dressed _ ground state of the system @xmath26 this relation shows that the second - order energy shift can be also obtained from the average value of the interaction hamiltonian on the dressed ground state of the system @xcite .",
    "we now consider the time - dependent situation , when the atom is initially in its bare ground - state .",
    "this state is not an eigenstate of the total hamiltonian and thus it evolves in time ( dynamical self - dressing ) @xcite , finally yielding a time - dependent casimir - polder force between the atom and the wall .",
    "in order to obtain the dynamical ( i.e. time - dependent ) casimir - polder energy - shift , and then the dynamical force , we can use a generalization of .",
    "in fact , we shall evaluate @xmath27 in the heisenberg representation and its average value on the initial state , that is the bare ground state of the atom - wall system . using the expressions for the heisenberg operators into the expression of the interaction hamiltonian , at the second order in the atom - field interaction we obtain    @xmath28\\\\ & + \\frac{4\\pi ic}v{s_{z}}(0){\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\mathbf{k'}jj'}}\\sqrt{kk'}\\left(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\mu$}\\cdot{\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{k}j,\\mathbf{r})}\\right)\\left(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\mu$}\\cdot{\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{k'}j',\\mathbf{r})}\\right)\\biggl [ { a_{\\mathbf{k}'j'}}(0)\\biggl(e^{i{\\omega_{0}}t}f^*({\\omega_{0}}+{\\omega_{k'}},t)-e^{-i{\\omega_{0}}t}f^*({\\omega_{k'}}-{\\omega_{0}},t)\\biggl)+h.c.\\biggl]\\\\ & \\times",

    "the energy shift @xmath38 diverges for @xmath39 , that is for @xmath40 , which is the time at which the field emitted by the atom , after reflection on the conducting wall , goes back at the atomic position .",
    "this divergence is not surprising , being related to the well - known divergences of the radiation reaction field and to the dipole approximation @xcite .",
    "it is also related to the assumption of an initially bare state @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we shall not consider the interaction energy at times @xmath41 .",
    "it is however worth to consider the casimir - polder energy for @xmath42 and for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively ) , that is before and after the `` back - reaction '' time . in both these timescales ,",
    "the analytical expression for the casimir - polder force , obtained in a quasi - static approach as minus the spatial derivative of the interaction energy , is    @xmath46+\\\\ & + \\bigl(ci[k_0(2d+ct)]-2ci(2k_0d)+ci[k_0|2d - ct|]\\bigl)\\bigl[2k_0d \\cos(2k_0d)\\bigl(3 - 2k_0 ^ 2d^2\\bigl)-3\\bigl(1 - 2k_0 ^ 2d^2\\bigl)\\sin(2k_0d)\\bigl]+\\\\ & + \\bigl(si[k_0(2d+ct)]-2si(2k_0d)+si[k_0(2d - ct)]+l\\pi\\bigl)\\bigl[3\\bigl(1 - 2k_0 ^ 2d^2\\bigl ) \\cos(2k_0d)+2k_0d\\bigl(3 - 2k_0 ^ 2d^2\\bigl ) \\sin(2k_0d)\\bigl]\\biggl ] \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the sine- and cosine integral functions @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 in is @xmath50 for @xmath44 and @xmath51 for @xmath45 .",
    "this expression clearly shows the divergence at @xmath40 discussed above .",
    "let now discuss some features of physical relevance of the expression obtained for the dynamical casimir - polder force . at @xmath52",
    "the force vanishes , due to the initial condition of a bare state . for successive times",
    "the force increases with an oscillatory behavior both in time and space , with scales given by @xmath53 . depending on the time @xmath54 and the atom - wall distance @xmath14",
    ", the force can be positive ( attractive ) or negative ( repulsive ) .",
    "this is a new feature compared to the stationary case for the ground - state atom , where the force is always attractive .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows a plot of the casimir - polder force for a fixed value of @xmath14 as a function of time for @xmath44 , that is @xmath55 .",
    "the mentioned oscillations of the value of the force are evident .",
    "an oscillatory behaviour of the force occurs also for @xmath45 , that is for @xmath56 , as shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "this plot shows also that for large @xmath54 the force settles to a negative value , asymptotically yielding a static attractive force . from or it is easy to show that the asymptotic value of the force coincides with that obtained with a time - independent approach .",
    "this indicates that , at large times , the atom is fully dressed and thus its interaction with the wall is the same as in the static case .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the fact that the force is not zero for @xmath57 , i.e. before a light signal from the atom can reach the wall , should not surprise .",
    "in fact , for @xmath30 the atom immediately `` knows '' of the existence of the wall , because it interacts with the field modes which incorporate the presence of the conducting wall .",
    "in this paper we have considered the dynamical ( time - dependent ) casimir - polder force between an initially bare ground - state atom and a perfectly conducting wall .",
    "an analytical expression of the time - dependent force has been obtained , which shows that , contrarily to the well - known stationary case of an attractive force for any atom - wall distance , the force oscillates in time from attractive to repulsive values .",
    "the scale of these oscillations is related to the atomic transition frequency .",
    "a characteristic timescale of the dynamical casimir - polder force is shown to be twice the time taken by a light signal to cover the atom - wall distance .",
    "this is physically understandable , because this is the time taken by the field emitted by the atom to go back to the atomic position , after being reflected on the wall , and interact with its source .",
    "work in progress concerns the dynamical atom - wall casimir - polder force in the case of an initially excited atom .",
