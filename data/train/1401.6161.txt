    "we do not know whether our value @xmath233 coincides exactly with the lower bound .",
    "we leave this observation here as coincidence and hope to elaborate on the precise relation in a future paper @xcite .    as an illustration ,",
    "let us compute @xmath234 for some specific functions . in some rare cases we can sum the entire series and",
    "can therefore compute the value exactly .",
    "for instance , for the class of functions @xmath235~z^k \\label{e42}\\ ] ] we compute @xmath236 with zeros @xmath237 and @xmath238 , such that @xmath239 .",
    "we can also compute a value closer to @xmath19 : @xmath240 leading to @xmath241 .",
    "we must terminate the summation and evaluate @xmath223 for a sufficiently large value of @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] we display our numerical results for @xmath242 obtained from the partial sum @xmath243 .",
    "the maximum values are @xmath244 , which coincide with the best known lower bound for @xmath19 up to the precision of the computation .        in this paper",
    "we have focused on separatrix behavior , which is a consequence of instabilities of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "we have interpreted separatrices as being eigenfunctions ( eigencurves ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are the initial conditions needed to specify the separatrix curves .",
    "for the differential equation @xmath0 $ ] , we have shown that the @xmath10th eigenvalue grows like @xmath247 for large @xmath10 .",
    "the number @xmath94 appears again in the numerical analysis of the first painlev transcendent .",
    "moreover , to the currently known precision , the number @xmath233 appears in another asymptotic context , namely , as the lower bound @xmath246 on the power series constant @xmath19 .",
    "we conjecture that the number @xmath233 may even be the exact value of @xmath19 .",
    "we emphasize that in this paper we have been interested in the limit of large eigenvalues . for linear eigenvalue problems",
    "this limit is accessible by using wkb theory . in the case of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem solved in this paper the large - eigenvalue limit",
    "is accessible because the problem becomes _ linear _ in this limit ; indeed , the large - eigenvalue separatrix curve was found by reducing the problem to a _ linear _ random walk problem , which can be solved exactly .",
    "the strategy of transforming a nonlinear problem to an equivalent linear problem is reminiscent of the hopf - cole substitution that reduces the nonlinear burgers equation to the linear diffusion equation or the inverse - scattering analysis that reduces the nonlinear korteweg - de vries equation to a linear integral equation .",
    "there is a plausible argument that the power series constant @xmath19 is connected with the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues : on one hand , @xmath19 is associated with the zero of largest modulus of a polynomial of degree @xmath10 , which is constructed as the @xmath10th partial sum of a taylor series . on the other hand ,",
