    "the linearity of quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental constraint on the processing of quantum information that has no classical counterpart .",
    "perhaps the most famous example is the no - cloning theorem which states that an unknown quantum state can not be copied @xcite .",
    "however , although exact copying is forbidden , one can still perform an approximate cloning .",
    "a quantum cloning machine is a device that with the help of an ancilla produces two or more approximate copies of an unknown quantum state .",
    "the problem of designing the optimal cloning transformations that maximize the fidelity of the clones has attracted a considerable amount of attention during recent years and optimal universal cloning machines for qubits @xcite and qudits @xcite have been found .",
    "experimentally , quantum cloning of polarization state of a photon was accomplished by means of stimulated parametric down - conversion @xcite and also by projecting two photonic qubits on a symmetric subspace with the help of a balanced beam splitter @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of cloning has been also extended to the domain of continuous variables where gaussian cloning machine for coherent states has been proposed @xcite .    the cloning operation can be represented by a unitary transformation on the total system consisting of the original state , blank copies and ancillas .",
    "this operation can be trivially reversed by applying inverse unitary transformation to the total system .",
    "in contrast , in this paper , we analyze a different _ locc reversibility _",
    "@xcite of cloning which uses only _ local operations _ on the clones and classical communication between them .",
    "the locc reversibility of universal @xmath0 cloning of qubits was theoretically discussed by bruss _",
    "@xcite who shown that the reversal can be accomplished by local operations on the two clones and classical communication by two different methods : ( a ) probabilistically , using separate measurements on ancilla and clone with unit fidelity but only with maximal success rate @xmath4 or ( b ) deterministically , using complete bell - state analysis on one clone and ancilla followed by an appropriate unitary operation on the other clone , similarly as in the quantum teleportation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the concept of locc reversibility to continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum cloning of coherent states where a feasible experimental test of _ deterministic _ locc reversibility of the cloning can be envisaged .",
    "note that a different kind of deterministic locc reversibility was recently analyzed in the context of cv quantum non - demolition measurements in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we shall demonstrate that the braunstein - kimble teleportation scheme @xcite realizes deterministic locc reversal of the optimal gaussian symmetric and even asymmetric @xmath0 quantum cloning of coherent states @xcite .",
    "the method is general and works for an arbitrary initial state ( not only for coherent states ) .",
    "we point out the differences between the locc reversibility of the qubit and cv quantum cloning",
    ". then we will show that it is possible to perform only a _ partial reversal _ of the @xmath0 cloning by means of locc operations .",
    "finally , we extend the locc reversibility to the @xmath5 cloning .    besides being of fundamental interest , the full and partial reversal of the cloning via locc operations may also find practical applications in quantum communication with continuous variables .",
    "for instance , the asymmetric cloning of coherent states represents the optimal individual gaussian eavesdropping attack on the quantum key distribution protocol with coherent states , homodyne detection and direct reconciliation @xcite and it also saturates the information exclusion principle when used as an eavesdropping attack on quantum key distribution protocol based on squeezed states proposed in ref .",
    "imagine that the eavesdropper eve keeps one clone and the anti - clone and sends the other clone to bob , see fig .",
    "1 . this attack may significantly reduce the rate of the secret key generation between the two communicating parties alice and bob and , eventually , it may prevent alice and bob from generating any secret key at all .",
    "however , if eve subsequently agrees to cooperate with bob ( perhaps for some fee ) she can supply to bob the data that will allow him to correct the outcomes of his homodyne measurements such that alice and bob will be able to distill secret key from the corrected data . as we shall see , the data transmitted during the reversal procedure does not carry any information about the signal , so in principle eve does not learn anything about the secret key by performing the reversal operation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the full locc reversal of the asymmetric @xmath0 cloning of coherent states . in section iii",
    "we extend this procedure to only a partial locc reversal that effectively converts symmetric cloning machine to the asymmetric one .",
    "a generalized reversal procedure for @xmath1 cloning machines is devised in section iv .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "the proposed setup for the complete locc reversal of asymmetric cloning of coherent states is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "2 . the setup can be divided into several blocks including the cloning , the bell measurement on one clone and the anti - clone , displacement of the state of the other clone and , finally , the analysis of the state of this clone by means of homodyne detection in order to confirm the success of the reversal . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss each of these operations in detail .",
    "the optimal and universal ( in the sense that all coherent states are cloned with the same fidelity ) gaussian @xmath0 asymmetric quantum cloning of coherent states is based on phase - insensitive amplification of the input single - mode optical field @xcite . the phase - insensitive amplification of coherent states was demonstrated with a good fidelity in the back - action evading measurements @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we propose an implementation of the asymmetric cloning using this available experimental technique .",
    "a scheme of the cloning device is situated in the upper left part of fig .",
    "first we split a fraction of the input coherent state in linearly polarized mode @xmath6 to the orthogonal polarization mode @xmath7 with the use of a half - wave plate wp1 aligned at angle @xmath8 with respect to the optical axis .",
    "the polarization mode @xmath7 is subsequently deflected to different spatial mode by a polarizing beam splitter pbs1 .",
    "the mode @xmath6 is then amplified with controllable amplitude gain @xmath9 in a type - ii phase - matched nonlinear crystal ( ktp ) .",
    "the signal @xmath6 and idler @xmath10 modes are two orthogonally polarized beams co - propagating through the crystal .",
    "the pump p for the crystal is prepared by frequency doubler @xmath11 from the master laser source l and it is injected and extracted by two dichroic mirrors dm1 and dm2 .",
    "the intensity of pumping controls the gain @xmath9 of the amplification .",
    "the idler beam containing the anti - clone ( phase - conjugated state ) after amplification is subtracted by polarizing beam splitter pbs2 and replaced by the mode @xmath7 having the same polarization .",
    "the two orthogonally polarized modes @xmath6 , @xmath7 are combined on half - wave plate wp2 aligned at angle @xmath12 and finally @xmath6 and @xmath7 are separated to different spatial modes at polarizing beam splitter pbs3 .",
    "the optimal gaussian asymmetric cloning machine for coherent states is obtained by setting the angles @xmath13 and the gain @xmath9 as follows @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 characterizes the asymmetry of the cloner .",
    "it is most convenient to perform the calculations in the heisenberg picture , where the optimal gaussian @xmath0 asymmetric cloning of coherent states is described by the following linear canonical transformation of the annihilation operators of the three involved modes @xcite : @xmath16 the annihilation operators @xmath17 , @xmath18 satisfy the commutation relations @xmath19=1 $ ] .",
    "the fidelity @xmath20 between the input coherent state and an output state of the @xmath21th clone can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mean number of chaotic photons in @xmath21th clone .",
    "specifically , the asymmetric cloning produces two replicas with the fidelities @xcite @xmath24 the optimal symmetric gaussian cloner with @xmath25 @xcite yields two equivalent clones with fidelity @xmath26 with respect to the initial coherent state . in case of symmetric cloning @xmath27 and the proposed setup",
    "can be simplified because we can remove wp1 and also pbs1 .",
    "interestingly , the asymmetric cloning machine can be obtained from the symmetric cloner by feeding the input ports @xmath7 and @xmath10 with two - mode squeezed vacuum @xcite .",
    "we now propose an experimentally feasible total reversal of the asymmetric cloning .",
    "suppose that eve possesses one clone in mode @xmath7 and also the idler mode @xmath10 ( i.e. the anti - clone ) while bob has the other clone in mode @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "1 . they would like to restore in bob s mode @xmath6 the original state sent by alice only by means of locc operations .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ cloner ] ) that bob must remove the noise in the operator @xmath28 which is represented by the term @xmath29 .",
    "eve can measure the non - hermitian operator @xmath30 by bell - type detection on modes @xmath7 and @xmath10 similarly as in the cv quantum teleportation @xcite . in this way",
    "eve can simultaneously measure two commuting quadratures @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath33 .",
    "the bell measurement is carried out by an eight - port homodyne detector which consists of a balanced beam splitter bs3 and two balanced homodyne detectors ( bhds ) , as is depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "the homodyne detectors involve balanced beam splitters bs4 , bs5 and four detectors d1-d4 .",
    "the necessary local oscillators @xmath34 are derived from the common master laser beam .",
    "after the measurements , the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 `` collapse '' to random measured values @xmath37 and @xmath38 hence the measured value of @xmath30 is @xmath39 which is physically encoded in a pair of photo - currents @xmath40 leaving the homodyne detectors .",
    "these photo - currents represent the classical message that has to be transmitted from eve to bob to reverse the cloning attack .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ cloner ] ) that the noise arising in the signal mode @xmath6 can be fully eliminated by the coherent displacement on mode @xmath6 @xmath41 which finishes the reversal . in the experiment ,",
    "a suitable displacement can be accomplished by overlapping the mode @xmath6 with a coherent state modulated in amplitude and phase by electro - optical modulators am and pm on a strongly unbalanced ( e.g. @xmath42 ) beam splitter bs9 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . to achieve the required displacement ,",
    "the photo - currents are pre - amplified in @xmath43 and @xmath44 in a proper way .",
    "note that the reversal operation is essentially the quantum teleportation of continuous - variable state @xcite .",
    "finally , a tomography of reversed state can be performed in the state analyzer .    since @xmath45 the locc reversibility of cv asymmetric cloning can be performed deterministically for _ arbitrary _ input state . moreover , if a thermal state with a high temperature is injected in the auxiliary inputs we are able to precisely restore any input state of mode @xmath6 although both clones exhibit only a negligible fidelity and all the information about the input state is stored in the intermodal correlations .",
    "in addition , this reversal can be performed even _ a - posteriori _ , after the homodyne measurement on bob s clone , simply by data manipulation corresponding to the displacement ( [ disp ] ) .",
    "this is important for the quantum cryptographic applications , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the reversibility of quantum cloning for qubit @xcite and cv coherent states seems to be analogical .",
    "however , there are important differences between the reversibility of qubit and cv quantum cloning arising from a different distribution of the discrete and continuous variable quantum information .",
    "mainly , it was shown in @xcite that we can conditionally restore the initial state with unit fidelity ( albeit with non - unit success rate ) only by separate local measurements on one clone and ancilla , which is impossible for the cv cloning .",
    "further , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that sufficient information to conditionally restore the input state in the anti - clone can be gained by measurement performed on the two clones .",
    "the same is clearly not true in the present case because in order to recover the original state of the signal mode @xmath6 in the idler mode @xmath10 we would have to measure the `` noise '' operator @xmath46 .",
    "however , the hermitian and anti - hermitian parts of @xmath47 do not commute hence it is impossible to measure @xmath47 .",
    "so far , we have considered only full reversal of the cloning transformation that perfectly restores the original state on the receiver s side . in this section",
    ", we extend this procedure to a partial optimal reversal .",
    "we shall show that by means of locc operations it is possible to convert the output of the asymmetric cloning machine ( [ cloner ] ) to the output of another optimal gaussian asymmetric cloning machine with a different asymmetry parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the main idea behind the partial reversal of the cloning is to perform a a partial quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of the two commuting noise operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this allows us to reduce to some extent the noise in bob s clone while the states of modes @xmath7 and @xmath10 are also partially preserved although some noise is added due to the back - action of the qnd measurement .",
    "the whole procedure is schematically depicted in terms of the quantum network in fig .",
    "two auxiliary modes initially prepared in the vacuum state and labeled @xmath51 and @xmath52 are used on eve s side .",
    "the information on the measured quadratures is transferred onto the quadratures @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , via a sequence of four qnd interactions @xmath55 where @xmath21 and @xmath56 are labels of the two interacting modes .",
    "we say that @xmath21 is the control mode ( denoted by full dot in fig .",
    "3 ) and @xmath56 is the target mode ( denoted by open circle with cross in fig .  3 ) .",
    "the inverse of ( [ qndcoupling ] ) is obtained by change of the sign of the coupling constant , @xmath57 , which is indicated in fig .  3 by a dagger .",
    "the value of @xmath58 determines the strength of the measurement of the noise quadratures , i.e. the asymmetry of the two clones after the partial reversal .",
    "recently , the qnd interaction has been realized between two polarization modes of optical field @xcite and also between polarization of bright beam and collective - spin degree of freedom of a macroscopic atomic ensemble @xcite .    since the qnd interaction is phase - sensitive",
    "it is most convenient to work with quadrature operators .",
    "after the sequence of the four qnd interactions depicted in fig .  3 , we have @xmath59 the operators @xmath60 and @xmath61 are measured by means of two balanced homodyne detectors and the measurement results @xmath62 and @xmath63 are communicated to bob who displaces the quadratures @xmath64 and @xmath65 of his clone as follows : @xmath66 the `` teleportation gain '' @xmath67 should be chosen such as to minimize the fluctuations of the output quadratures @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in the case of optimal gaussian asymmetric cloning of coherent states",
    "we find that the optimal gain reads @xmath70 and we effectively get @xmath71    we claim that with the gain ( [ gain ] ) the partial reversal procedure produces two optimal gaussian asymmetric clones in modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 . to prove this we calculate the fidelities of the clones in modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 after partial reversal , assuming that the mode @xmath6 was initially in coherent state while @xmath7 and @xmath10 were in vacuum state .",
    "with the help of formula ( [ fidelityj ] ) we obtain after a simple algebra @xmath72}{2[\\kappa^2+\\exp(2\\gamma)]+1},\\nonumber\\\\ f_{s'}&=&\\frac{2}{2+\\exp(2\\gamma)+\\kappa^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are exactly the fidelities ( [ fidelitiesasymmetric ] ) with an effective asymmetry parameter @xmath48 given by @xmath73.\\ ] ] this confirms that our procedure yields the same output as the optimal gaussian asymmetric cloner ( [ cloner ] ) with @xmath74 .",
    "the qnd coupling required for the implementation of the partial reversal of the cloning of coherent states naturally emerges as an effective interaction describing the off - resonant coupling of light with the collective spin degree of freedom of an ensemble of atoms .",
    "so , if the clones and anti - clones were stored in the atomic memories @xcite , one could perform the required qnd measurements of @xmath49 and @xmath50 simply by sending two beams of light through the two ensembles , followed by homodyne detection on the output beams , similarly as in the experiment where two ensembles were entangled by interaction with a light pulse that passed through them @xcite .",
    "an all - optical implementation of the partial reversal is a bit more involved but nevertheless feasible .",
    "the qnd measurement of the optical field quadrature can be implemented using single type - ii phase - matched nonlinear crystal sandwiched between two half - wave plates aligned at evasion angle , and the signal and the meter are two orthogonally polarized beams co - propagating through the device @xcite . for a particular gain - dependent orientation of the half - wave plates ,",
    "this device accomplishes the qnd interaction ( [ qndcoupling ] ) .",
    "the setup depicted in fig .",
    "3 can be simplified to a scheme that requires only two qnd interactions and two balanced beam splitters .",
    "the resulting all - optical setup is depicted in fig .",
    "4 . the modes @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath10 are first combined on a balanced beam splitter .",
    "two qnd devices are used for partial measurement of the @xmath75 quadrature of the first output mode and the @xmath76 quadrature of the second mode .",
    "after the qnd interactions , the modes @xmath7 and @xmath10 are re - combined on second balanced beam splitter while the quadratures @xmath53 and @xmath54 are measured by two homodyne detectors . since the experiments with two qnd measurements in the setup have been already reported @xcite , this experimental implementation of the partial bell type measurement for the continuous variables appears to be feasible .",
    "let us now consider an extension of the locc reversal procedure to the symmetric @xmath78 cloning machine that produces @xmath79 clones and @xmath80 anticlones from a single replica @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath80 clones and @xmath80 anti - clones are distributed among @xmath80 eavesdroppers such that each eavesdropper possesses one clone and one anticlone .",
    "the remaining single clone is sent to bob , as is depicted in fig .",
    "5 . after the distribution ,",
    "a part @xmath81 of eavesdroppers decide to collaborate with bob who would like to increase the fidelity of his clone .",
    "we show that it is sufficient if each collaborating eavesdropper performs local bell type measurement on her clone and anti - clone and sends the measurement results to bob via classical communication channel . as a result ,",
    "bob can obtain a clone with fidelity corresponding to optimal gaussian @xmath82 cloning only using locc operations .",
    "the symmetric @xmath78 cloner is based on the phase - insensitive amplification , similarly as the @xmath0 cloner considered in sec .",
    "after the amplification with gain @xmath83 , the signal mode is split into @xmath79 spatially separated modes by @xmath84 balanced coupler that can be described by the following transformation of annihilation operators @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath28 is annihilation operator of signal mode leaving the amplifier which is sent to the @xmath79th input port of the coupler .",
    "the modes in the remaining @xmath80 input ports characterized by annihilation operators @xmath87 are assumed to be in vacuum state .",
    "we define @xmath88 and the matrix @xmath89 is unitary .",
    "similarly , the idler mode is also split into @xmath80 separate modes by the same technique .",
    "the symmetric @xmath78 cloner can be thus described by the following transformation , @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 are annihilation operators of auxiliary modes which are assumed to be in vacuum states .",
    "the matrix @xmath93 is unitary if we define @xmath94 .",
    "each clone in the @xmath79 signal modes @xmath95 produced by this cloner exhibits the same fidelity @xmath96    let @xmath97 be the number of eavesdroppers willing to collaborate with bob .",
    "the partial reversal of the @xmath78 cloning can be achieved by @xmath98-fold eight - port homodyne measurement separately performed on pairs of modes @xmath99 , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , see fig .",
    "5 . similarly as before , it is a measurement of two commuting two - mode quadratures on every pair , which can be also conveniently interpreted as measuring the non - hermitian operator @xmath102 yielding a set of complex numbers @xmath103 . if all these measurement results are available to bob , he can displace his mode @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath67 is electronic gain adjusted properly so as to maximally enhance the fidelity of the bob s clone .",
    "a simple algebra reveals that @xmath106 the mean number of chaotic photons in the clone @xmath104 after the displacement ( [ displacement ] ) can be easily calculated if we take into account that all modes @xmath87 and @xmath92 are initially in vacuum or coherent state .",
    "one obtains @xmath107 the triple summation in eq .",
    "( [ nbarm ] ) can be evaluated by noting that @xmath108 is unitary and @xmath109 .",
    "the sum over @xmath56 reads @xmath110 . on inserting this back into eq .",
    "( [ nbarm ] ) and summing over @xmath21 and @xmath111 we finally obtain @xmath112 the maximum fidelity is achieved by minimizing the noise @xmath113 and the optimal gain is given by @xmath114 for this gain we get @xmath115 . the corresponding fidelity of coherent - state clone after the reversal @xmath116 is exactly the fidelity of optimal symmetric gaussian @xmath82 cloning of coherent states .",
    "a complete restoration of the original occurs only for @xmath117 , i.e. when all eavesdroppers collaborate with bob .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the locc reversibility of quantum cloning of coherent states and proposed a feasible setup for an experimental test .",
    "we have proved that the braunstein - kimble teleportation scheme for continuous variables @xcite can be used for deterministic locc reversal of the asymmetric @xmath0 cloning machine @xcite for arbitrary input state .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to perform only a partial locc reversal based on a partial bell type measurement which effectively converts the symmetric cloner to asymmetric one .",
    "this principle can be extended also to reversal of @xmath78 cloning machines .",
    "the prospects for the experimental demonstration of the total locc reversal of the symmetric @xmath0 cloning seem to be very good .",
    "first , a high - quality amplification of the coherent signal was experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "second , in the cv teleportation experiment @xcite , the achieved fidelity ( @xmath118 ) is close to the maximal value corresponding to the finite amount of entanglement shared between alice and bob .",
    "these spectacular experimental achievements strongly suggest that with the present day technology it should be possible to demonstrate the increase of cloning fidelity from @xmath26 to the value near unity via the locc reversal procedure .",
    "quantum cloning machines represent frequently considered individual coherent eavesdropping attacks on quantum key distribution protocols @xcite .",
    "an eavesdropper eve uses two imperfect clones of the state sent by alice .",
    "eve transmits one clone to bob , and measures the other when the measurement basis is revealed during the reconciliation procedure . due to the reversibility of quantum cloning ,",
    "it is possible in principle to recover a full security of the quantum communication link only by local operations on clones and classical communication between eve and bob in the case that eve has decided to collaborate with bob in a time after her attack on the link and before the measurement on her clone and anti - clone .",
