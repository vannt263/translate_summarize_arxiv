    "cooling to the motional ground state of a mechanical oscillator with frequency @xmath53 and linewidth @xmath54 ( fwhm ) using an optical cavity with frequency @xmath55 and amplitude decay rate @xmath56 in practice means reducing the average thermal occupation to @xmath57 . in order to resolve the mechanical noise spectrum",
    "this also means that the effective mechanical quality factor @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is the optomechanically broadened quality factor and is different from the intrinsic quality factor @xmath60 . to experimentally achieve such cooling performances , we significantly increase the optomechanical coupling from bare si@xmath2n@xmath3 resonators by adding photonic crystals , which allow us to reach reflectivities between 95@xmath61 and 99@xmath61 ( see main text ) . in the following analysis",
    ", we calculate the phonon occupancies and the corresponding effective quality factors that are achievable by optomechanically cooling the mechanical resonators presented in this letter .",
    "the optomechanical coupling changes the mechanical properties of the resonator , giving rise to an effective frequency @xmath62 and damping rate @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are the shifted frequency and damping rate due to the optomechanical interaction , derived from the modified mechanical susceptibility in frequency space @xmath66 , which are given by @xcite @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the laser frequency , @xmath70 the detuning with respect to the cavity , @xmath71 the linearized optomechanical coupling strength , @xmath72 the average cavity photon number , @xmath73 the laser power , @xmath74 the amplitude decay rate of the input mirror , @xmath75 the reduced planck constant , @xmath76 the single - photon optomechanical coupling , @xmath77 the zero - point fluctuation of the mechanical mode , and @xmath78 the effective mass of the mechanical mode .",
    "note that these effects are most pronounced for @xmath79 .      using the previous equations one can calculate the effective mechanical quality factor @xmath80 and the oscillator s final average phonon occupancy , which in general is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the average phonon occupancy of a thermal bath at temperature @xmath83 , @xmath9 is boltzmann s constants , and @xmath84 is the minimum phonon occupancy .",
    "note that @xmath76 depends on the configuration of the cavity through @xmath85 .",
    "we estimate @xmath86 and @xmath59 starting from room temperature for two different configurations of particular interest , namely the 2 mirror ( 2mc ) and the 3 mirror ( 3mc ) configurations , described below . for both configurations we use the parameters indicated in table  [ table:2 ] .       in order to measure the effects of the different design parameters on the mechanical quality factor and frequency we start with a set of nominal parameters and sweep each one while keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "our nominal parameters are : @xmath87 m , @xmath88 m , @xmath89 m , @xmath90 m , @xmath91 m .",
    "the following plots include a blue - dashed line representing the nominal value of the swept parameter . by changing the size of the inside and outside fillets we effectively change the length of the tethers . in order to decouple these parameters we change the size of the window , @xmath21 , as a way to change the length of the tethers . while the relationship of these parameters with frequencies is experimentally robust ,",
    "one of the main challenges is observing these parameters effects on the mechanical quality factors which are susceptible to unavoidable fabrication imperfections due to small changes in handling and contaminants from sample to sample . to mitigate this effect , all resonators for these sweeps are fabricated with @xmath92  nm and @xmath93 m , where we know that our quality factors are consistently high .",
    "the first parameter we investigate is the length of the tethers which we effectively vary by changing the size of the square window ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : si1 ] , increasing the length of the tethers increases @xmath1 and decreases @xmath0 , as expected , with almost no change in the @xmath6 product .",
    "we next sweep the width of the tethers from the nominal value of 5  @xmath31 m to 64  @xmath31 m , which is the maximum width before the tethers begin to overlap ( figure  [ fig : si2 ] ) .",
    "we measure the mechanical frequency increase and quality factor decrease towards a plateau near @xmath94 , which is also the quality factor for a 50  nm thick square membrane of 700  @xmath31 m . intuitively in the limit of increasing tether width the tethered membranes begin to resemble square membranes where the tether width can no longer be properly defined and only the size of the window , @xmath21 , defines the lateral geometry of the membrane .",
    "we see a large enhancement in @xmath1 from @xmath95 to @xmath96 when we decrease the tether width from 9  @xmath31 m to 5  @xmath31 m as the membranes losses begin to be dominated by clamping losses associated with strings ( @xmath97 ) .      from finite element simulations",
    "we know that the contraction of relaxing material in the central membrane plays a key role in the enhancement of stress in the tethers .",
    "we sweep the size of the central membrane , @xmath98 , in order to see how it enhances the stress in the tethers and ideally increases @xmath6 . as we increase @xmath98 , we simultaneously also increase @xmath21 to keep the length of the tethers constant .",
    "we find that the mechanical quality factors remain at nominal values while the frequency drops dramatically as the resonator mass increases quadratically ( figure  [ fig : si3 ] ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath6 improves with decreasing membrane size . from a practical standpoint , the optimal size of the membrane",
    "is set by the minimum cavity beam waist which can still achieve large reflectivities from the photonic crystal on the central membrane . by using a small beam waist the size of the central membrane",
    "can be minimized in order to increase @xmath6 , with the limit of good mode overlap with the photonic crystal to achieve high reflectivities .",
    "a beam waist of 20  @xmath31 m gives us maximal reflectivity and requires a minimum photonic crystal mirror with @xmath99 m in order to overlap the tails of the gaussian beam .",
    "in addition , as the inner fillet radius between tethers and central membrane is increased , there is a slight increase in quality factor with a large decrease in frequency as the mass of the central membrane increases ( figure  [ fig : si4 ] ) .",
    "we also vary the size of the outer fillet radius between the tether and the edge of the window .",
    "it is however difficult to directly compare resonators with different outer - fillet shapes since larger outer - fillets require longer koh release times .",
    "the increased etching times also widens the overhang around the perimeter of the window , which we find to lower the mechanical quality factors for nominal dimensions ( figure  [ fig : si5 ] ) .",
    "last but not least , we also vary the number of tethers connecting the central membrane to the substrate , @xmath100 . we sweep it from @xmath101 to @xmath102 as shown in figure  [ fig : si6](a , b ) while keeping all other parameters nominal . the observed shift in frequency in these `` pinwheel '' flexural resonators",
    "is from 170  khz ( @xmath101 ) to almost 350  khz ( @xmath102 ) . in order to keep the lengths of the tethers equal ,",
    "a rotationally symmetric design is required . in figure",
    "[ fig : si6](c , d ) , we show a resonator with @xmath103 tethers , each 500  nm wide , and a square hole through the substrate for optical access .",
    "this large-@xmath100 design exhibits frequencies around 1  mhz , with @xmath1@xmath4@xmath104 , which could be an interesting approach to further mitigate classical laser noise .",
    "an important fabrication challenge for such devices is to keep the overhang at the perimeter of the resonator to a minimum in order to reduce radiative losses into the substrate .",
    "the smallest overhang we were able to attain was @xmath105 m wide , which incurred significant losses resulting in @xmath106@xmath107 .",
    "the nominal design ( @xmath101 ) keeps the overhang to a minimum due to the nature of rectangular crystal lattice etching of @xmath108 silicon .        using fdtd simulations we are able to optimize for the most reflective design at different photonic crystal thicknesses ( @xmath109  nm ) for 1550  nm light . in our simulations we sweep the lattice constant @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the radius of the holes . using these parameters",
    ", we are able to experimentally verify the fdtd results which show increased maximum reflectivity with increasing thickness of the photonic crystal @xmath18 ( see figure  [ fig : si7 ] ) . while we only plot transmittance @xmath83 measurements for clarity , we also experimentally confirm that the reflectivity @xmath113 to within our measurement error by using the membranes as part of a fabry - prot cavity in conjunction with another mirror with known reflectivity ."
