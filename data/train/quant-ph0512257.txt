    "quantum engineering of nonclassical light has attracted remarkable interest in the last decade @xcite .",
    "this interest has further been stimulated by a recent theoretical demonstration of knill _",
    "et al _ @xcite that linear optical systems enable efficient quantum computation .",
    "such systems are experimentally realizable with present - day technology @xcite , since they are based only on beam splitters ( bss ) and phase shifters ( pss ) together with photodetectors and single - photon sources .    in this paper ,",
    "linear systems are studied for the _ optical - state truncation _ , which refers to truncation of the fock - state expansion of an input optical state @xmath3 , into the following finite superposition of @xmath0 states : @xmath4 which is called the optical _ qudit _ state ( @xmath0-dimensional generalized qubit ) . here",
    "the input state @xmath6 can be a coherent state @xmath7 , or any other infinite or finite dimensional state .",
    "systems for the optical - state truncation are referred to as the _ quantum scissors devices _ ( qsds ) .",
    "the first and simplest qsd was proposed by pegg _",
    "et al _ @xcite , then analyzed theoretically in various contexts by others @xcite , and experimentally realized by babichev _",
    "et al _ @xcite and resch _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "this device , schematically depicted in figure 1 , is composed of linear optical elements ( two beam splitters bs1 and bs2 ) and photodetectors d2 and d4 ( label 4 is used for consistency with the other schemes that are discussed in the following ) .",
    "if a single - photon fock state @xmath8 is in one of the input modes @xmath9 or @xmath10 and the vacuum state is in the other input , while the measurement has resulted in a single count in one of the detectors and no count in the other , then the state @xmath11 , given by ( [ n01 ] ) , in the input mode @xmath12 can be truncated to the qubit state @xmath13 in the output mode @xmath14 , as a special case of ( [ n02 ] ) .",
    "detailed analysis of the conditions to obtain the target state ( [ n03 ] ) as a function of the bs parameters , input states and measurement outcomes will be reviewed in section 3 .",
    "the described optical state truncation based on conditional measurements is referred to as the _ projection synthesis _",
    "@xcite , which is a powerful method applied also for other purposes @xcite . by analyzing figure 1 ,",
    "it is easy to observe that light from the input mode @xmath12 can not reach the output mode @xmath14 .",
    "so , one can conclude that the truncation is achieved via the quantum teleportation ( @xcite , for a review see @xcite ) , though not of the entire input state but only of the first two terms of its fock - state expansion @xcite .",
    "thus , in a special case , if the input field is already prepared in a qubit state , then the scissors become a conventional teleporting device . however",
    ", contrary to the unconditional teleportation scheme of bennett _ et al _ @xcite , the teleportation ( and truncation ) via the pegg - phillips - barnett qsd is successful only in the cases when the two detectors count one photon in total .",
    "the concept of optical - state truncation is by no means limited to the discussed truncation of the number - state expansion of a given state .",
    "for instance , by considering truncation of a coherent state , defined by the action of the displacement operator on the vacuum state , one can truncate the displacement operator and then apply it to the vacuum state .",
    "such a truncated state is essentially different ( for @xmath15 ) from that given by ( [ n02 ] ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is physically realizable , e.g. , in a pumped ring cavity with a kerr nonlinear medium as was demonstrated by leoski _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the qsd schemes can also be generalized for the truncation of two - mode @xcite or multi - mode fields .",
    "the original pegg - phillips - barnett qsd enables the truncation of an input state only to qubit and qutrit ( @xmath16-dimensional qudit ) states as was shown by koniorczyk _",
    "et al _ @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss a generalization of the qsd for truncation and teleportation of @xmath17 dimensional qudits and suggest a way to extend the scheme for an arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "our approach is essentially different from the other qudit truncation schemes @xcite and we believe that it is easier to be experimentally realized .",
    "the proposed scheme is based on an eight - port optical interferometer shown in figure 2 .",
    "the setup resembles a well - known multiport interferometer of zeilinger _",
    "et al _ @xcite , which has been theoretically analyzed @xcite and experimentally applied @xcite for various purposes but , to our knowledge , has not yet been used for optical - state truncation .",
    "an important difference between the standard multiport and that proposed here lies in the elimination of the apex bs of the triangle .",
    "this elimination is important for the processes of truncation and teleportation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the generalized quantum scissors device is proposed including a description of the setup ( 2.1 ) , a short review of multiport unitary transformations ( 2.2 ) , and explanation of the projection synthesis ( 2.3 ) , which enables the qudit state truncation .",
    "reductions of the generalized qsd to the pegg - phillips - barnett qsd are demonstrated in section 3 .",
    "detailed analyses of the generalized qsd for the truncation up to three , four and five photon - number states are given in sections 4 , 6 , and 7 , respectively .",
    "selective truncations , which can be interpreted as a fock - state filtering @xcite or a hole burning in fock space @xcite , are discussed in section 5 .",
    "how imperfect photon counting deteriorates the truncation processes is discussed in section 8 by including realistic photon - number resolutions , inefficiency , and dark counts of photodetectors .",
    "final conclusions with a discussion of open problems including a generalization of the scheme for an arbitrary qudit state truncations are presented section 9 .",
    "we analyze a generalized quantum scissors device ( gqsd ) based on an eight - port optical interferometer , also referred to as a multiport mixer or multiport beam splitter , which is assembled in a pyramid - like configuration of ordinary beam splitters ( bss ) and phase shifters ( pss ) as shown in figure 2 .",

    "we have not written explicitly @xmath37 in the sequence ( [ n07 ] ) , since the reflection phase shifts @xmath38 for modes 1 , 2 and 3 can be incorporated in @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . besides the reflection phase shift in mode 4 does not affect photodetection in d4 , and thus can be neglected .",
    "the described setup resembles a well - known multiport interferometer in triangle configuration of the beam splitters as studied in various contexts , since its theoretical proposal and experimental realizations by zeilinger _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "however , an important difference between the standard multiport interferometer and that analyzed here is the elimination of the apex bs of the triangle , which is usually placed at the crossing of beams 1 and 4 in figure 2 . in particular",
    ", the setup for the pegg - phillips - barnett qsd resembles the zeilinger six - port interferometer with one bs removed .",
    "this elimination is essential for the processes of truncation and teleportation of qudits as will be shown in the following .",
    "the annihilation operators @xmath42 at the @xmath43 inputs to multiport linear interferometer are related to the annihilation operators @xmath44 at the @xmath43 outputs as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the elements of the unitary scattering matrix @xmath30 , and @xmath47 is the unitary operator describing the evolution of the @xmath43-mode input state , say @xmath48 , into the @xmath43-mode output state , say @xmath49 : @xmath50 by introducing the column vectors @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] , the set of equations ( [ n11 ] ) can compactly be rewritten as @xmath53 from which follow the inverse relations for the creation operators @xmath54 then , one can observe that @xmath55 by applying ( [ n15 ] ) and noting that neither bss nor pss change the vacuum state , @xmath56 , one can calculate the output state @xmath49 of the multiport interferometer described by the scattering matrix @xmath30 for the input fock states @xmath57 as follows ( for detailed examples see @xcite ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total number of photons ; @xmath60 labeled by @xmath61 stands for multiple sum over @xmath62 .",
    "we apply the last equation of ( [ n16 ] ) in our analytical approach , and the second last equation in our numerical analysis .",
    "we are interested in the optical truncation schemes based on the generalized qsd , shown in figure 2 , or its simplified versions depicted in figure 3(a),(b ) .",
    "the input mode @xmath12 , being in an arbitrary pure state , given by ( [ n01 ] ) , is truncated to a qudit state , given by ( [ n02 ] ) , in mode @xmath14 . to achieve the truncation desired",
    ", we assume that modes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath63 are in the fock states @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "thus , the total four - mode input state is @xmath67 which is transformed into the output state @xmath68 , according to ( [ n12 ] ) .",
    "now , photon - counting of the output modes @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is performed yielding @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 photons , respectively .",
    "if the total number of detected photons is equal to the sum of photons in modes @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath76 , then the total four - mode output state @xmath77 is reduced to the following single - mode state : @xmath78 with the amplitudes @xmath79 defined as",
    "@xmath80 depending , in particular , on the beam splitter transmittances @xmath81 $ ] and phase shifts @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 . in the following , we present solutions for @xmath84 assuming @xmath85 . nevertheless ,",
    "since the action of the phase shifter @xmath86 with @xmath83 simply corresponds to the transformation of @xmath84 into @xmath87 , one can readily obtain the general solutions for any @xmath83 .",
    "perfect truncation is achieved independently of the form of the input state @xmath88 if the amplitudes @xmath89 are equal to each other for all @xmath90 or , equivalently , @xmath91 for some properly chosen values of the bs transmittances @xmath92 and phase shifts @xmath93 .",
    "so , the problem is to find such @xmath92 and @xmath93 , for which the amplitudes @xmath79 satisfy condition ( [ n20 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , for a possible experimental realization of the scheme , it is essential to have bss with variable transmittance .",
    "a possible solution is to replace each of the bss by a mach - zehnder interferometer composed of two symmetric 50:50 bss , two mirrors and two pss @xcite .",
    "our numerical minimalization of @xmath94 reveals that perfect truncation using the generalized qsd can be realized for various values of the bs transmittances and phase shifts , which however , correspond to different probabilities of successful truncation . here",
    ", we focus on very simple analytical solutions rather than numerically optimized approximate ones . in the following",
    ", we will analyze in detail truncations up to six - dimensional qudits .",
    "the described truncation process via the gqsd can be considered a kind of the form - limited quantum teleportation of the first @xmath0 terms of the fock - state expansion of the incident light in analogy to the qutrit - limited teleportation via the pegg - phillips - barnett qsd discussed in @xcite .",
    "even a brief analysis of figure 2 , shows that no light from the input port 4 can reach the output port 1 .",
    "in fact , this transformation is based on the same principles of the quantum entanglement and the bell - state measurement ( the projection postulate ) as the original bennett _",
    "et al _ teleportation scheme @xcite .",
    "the multi - photon entangled state is created by the beam splitters and , as required , the original state @xmath88 is destroyed by the bell - state measurement implemented by the bss 3 - 5 and detectors 2 - 4 .",
    "thus , by assuming that an incident light is already prepared in a @xmath0-dimensional ( up to @xmath0=6 ) qudit state @xmath95 and the conditional measurement is successfully performed , then the state is teleported from mode @xmath12 to @xmath96 in mode @xmath14 .",
    "first , we show how the eight - port qsd can truncate the input state @xmath88 , given by ( [ n01 ] ) , to qubit state , given by ( [ n03 ] ) , as expected by the original pegg - phillips - barnett scissors device @xcite .",
    "the system shown in figure 1 is a special case of that shown in figure 2 by assuming , e.g. , that bss 1 , 3 and 5 are perfectly reflecting , thus a complete set of transmittances is @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "note that , in this configuration , the input port 1 and the output port 4 are unimportant , so can be neglected .",
    "another way to generate the truncated state ( [ n03 ] ) is to remove bss 2 , 3 and 5 as shown in figure 3(a ) .",
    "thus , the simplified version of the gqsd is described by the transmittances @xmath98 , \\label{n21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we can also set that the only nonzero phase shift is @xmath99 . in this configuration ,",
    "the input mode @xmath63 is only reflected from the large mirror and leaves the system without interfering with the other modes .",
    "thus , the truncation occurs independently of the input state @xmath66 and the photon counting result in detector d3 .",
    "let @xmath100 denote the output state @xmath101 in mode @xmath14 for the input states @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath88 in modes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , together with detection of @xmath72 and @xmath74 photons in detectors d2 and d4 , respectively .",
    "note that equivalently one can analyze @xmath104 $ ] instead of ( [ n21 ] ) to reduce the system to the pegg - phillips - barnett qsd . by applying ( [ n07 ] ) to ( [ n16 ] ) with transmittances given by ( [ n21 ] ) ,",
    "one readily finds the output states : @xmath105 as follows from ( [ n22 ] ) , the states @xmath106 and @xmath107 become perfectly truncated qubit states if @xmath108 and @xmath109 . on the other hand , @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    "become ( [ n03 ] ) for the same transmittances of bss 1 and 4 and phase shift @xmath112 .",
    "the optimized solution , giving the highest probability of successful truncation , is found for the 50:50 bss ( @xmath113 ) in all 4 cases .",
    "it is worth noting that in @xcite , the internal phases of both bss are chosen as @xmath114 and @xmath115 , so to obtain the exact equivalence of the original scheme with ours , it is enough to set the phase shift @xmath116 .    as shown by koniorczyk _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the pegg - phillips - barnett scissors device enables also the truncation of an arbitrary incident state to the qutrit state @xmath117 which can be obtained in our setup by assuming the single - photon fock states in the input modes @xmath9 and @xmath10 , together with the single - photon counts in detectors d2 and d4 . under these assumptions and by denoting @xmath118 , the output state in mode @xmath14 becomes @xmath119 which is the desired truncated state if the parameters of bs1 and bs4 are related as follows : @xmath120 and the phase shift @xmath121 is equal to @xmath29 or zero , respectively . by inspection of ( [ n25 ] )",
    "one readily finds that the optimum solutions occur for @xmath122 equal either to @xmath123 or to @xmath124 and @xmath125 if @xmath126 , in agreement with the results of @xcite , but also for @xmath127 if @xmath116 .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate how to realize truncation of an input state @xmath88 , given by ( [ n01 ] ) , to the four - dimensional qudit @xmath128 referred to as the _",
    "quartit_. we apply the gqsd shown in figure 2 , assuming that modes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath63 are the in single - photon fock states , and single photons have been measured in all detectors , @xmath129 .",
    "if the light to be truncated enters the interferometer in mode @xmath12 , then the output state @xmath130 obtained via the projection synthesis is given by ( [ n17 ] ) for @xmath131 and the amplitudes @xmath132 dependent on the bs and ps parameters . by applying the procedure described in section 2 , we find that the simplest solution is for @xmath133 and reads as @xmath134 it is seen that @xmath135 is independent of the bs3 parameters , so for simplicity let us assume that bs3 is removed ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "thus , instead of a general setup , shown in figure 2 , we first analyze its simplified version shown in figure 3(b ) . under the assumption ,",
    "the solutions for the other amplitudes are found to be @xmath137 where , for brevity , the @xmath138-primed @xmath139 denotes @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and the global phase factor @xmath142 , the same for all @xmath143 , was omitted as it cancels out during the renormalization with @xmath144 .",
    "our multiport interferometer can act as a good quantum scissors device if there exist parameters @xmath92 and @xmath145 such that condition ( [ n20 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "as explained in subsection 2.3 , we focus on the simplicity of the solutions , although we realize that they are not optimal as implied by the results of our numerical experiments .",
    "for example , a simple solution is found for the transmittances equal to @xmath146 \\label{n30}\\ ] ] and zero phase shifts @xmath93 except @xmath147 . by applying these values to ( [ n29 ] )",
    ", one readily finds that @xmath148 for @xmath149 .",
    "another solution of ( [ n20 ] ) is found for the transmittances @xmath150 \\label{n31}\\ ] ] and @xmath151 , which results in a constant amplitude @xmath152 , although much lower than that found for the first solution .",
    "numerically it is easy to find solutions , which correspond to higher @xmath143 than those given by our analytical solutions .",
    "e.g. , by choosing @xmath153 $ ] and zero phase shifts @xmath93 except @xmath154 , then the amplitudes @xmath143 for the output state @xmath130 are constant at the value of 0.134",
    ".    a closer look at the amplitudes ( [ n29 ] ) reveals that they remain unchanged by some permutations of transmittances accompanied by a proper change in the phase shifts , or by replacement of @xmath155 by @xmath156 . in particular , we find the following relations : @xmath157,{\\mbf \\xi } )   \\label{n32}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath158 , and @xmath159,{\\mbf \\xi'})\\nonumber\\\\ & = &   c^{(4)}_n([t_1 ^ 2,t_2 ^ 2,1,t_4 ^ 2,1-t_5 ^ 2]{\\mbf \\xi '' } )   \\label{n33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath160 except for @xmath161 or , equivalently , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 .",

    "although , it is out of the main goal of this paper , it is possible to give more general conditions for @xmath92 , e.g. : ( i ) for any @xmath199 $ ] with @xmath200 and @xmath201 , the output state is @xmath186 , ( ii ) for any @xmath202 $ ] with @xmath203 the output state is @xmath204 , assuming in both cases @xmath151 . as already emphasized , the solutions presented here are usually not optimized , but simple enough to show analytically that the specific truncations can be realized by the gqsd .",
    "a question arises whether the gqsd , shown in figure 3(b ) with the removed bs3 , can be used for truncation of the input state up to more than quartits .",
    "so , first we analyze possibilities of the truncation of an input state @xmath6 , given by ( [ n01 ] ) , to the qudit state @xmath205 being a special case of ( [ n02 ] ) for @xmath206 . as usual , we assume that light to be truncated is in mode @xmath12 , and the input modes @xmath9 and @xmath63 are in the single - photon states , but , by contrast to the former sections , we choose mode @xmath10 to be in the two - photon state .",
    "so , the total input state is @xmath207 .",
    "we assume that the conditional measurement yields the single - photon counts in detectors d2 and d4 , but the two - photon count in d3 , thus the resulting output state @xmath208 is given by ( [ n18 ] ) for @xmath206 and the amplitudes @xmath209 equal to @xmath210 @xmath211 @xmath212 \\\\ & & + e^{i(\\xi _ { 2}+\\xi _ { 4}+\\xi _ { 5})}r_{1}r_{5 } [ 2r_{1}^{2}g_{2}r_{4}^{2}f_{5}'-2t_{1}^{2 } ( f_{2}'+r_{2}^{2})g_{4}f_{5 } '' \\\\ & & -r_{1}^{2}g_{2 } ( t_{4}^{2}f_{5}''+2r_{4}^{2}t_{5}^{2})]\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath213,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath214 as in ( [ n29 ] ) , the irrelevant global phase factor @xmath142 was canceled out from all @xmath215 in ( [ n46 ] ) .",
    "we have not found analytical solutions for the bs and ps parameters satisfying condition ( [ n20 ] ) with @xmath206 for the amplitudes given by ( [ n46 ] ) , as the problem requires finding roots of 6th order equations .",
    "thus , we have applied numerical procedure for finding the bs parameters for which @xmath216 with precision of the order of @xmath217 .",
    "we have found various solutions including that for the transmittances equal to @xmath218=[0.30464 , 0.38775 , 1 , 0.81740 , 0.18438 ] , @xmath116 and the other phase shifts set to zero , which results in the constant amplitude @xmath215 for @xmath219 . by placing bs3 in the setup with @xmath220 one",
    "can find the other solutions with larger constant @xmath215 .",
    "however , since we are not interested in the optimalization but rather simplicity of the scheme , we do not present these solutions here .",
    "the eight - port qsd , shown in figure 2 , enables truncation of the incident light @xmath6 even to the six - dimensional qudit state @xmath221 as a special case of ( [ n02 ] ) for @xmath2 . to achieve the perfect truncation",
    ", we assume a single - photon fock state in mode @xmath10 , two - photon states in modes @xmath222 , and that the conditional measurement yields @xmath223 and @xmath224 photon counts .",
    "then , the output state @xmath225 is given by ( [ n18 ] ) for @xmath2 and the amplitudes @xmath226 the simplest - form amplitude is for @xmath133 , which reads as @xmath227 as in the former cases for the truncation to qudits with @xmath228 , the amplitude @xmath229 is independent of the bs3 parameters .",
    "unfortunately , contrary to the former cases , we have not found numerically any solutions satisfying @xmath230const for @xmath231 for the simplified scheme with removed bs3 , shown in figure 3(b ) .",
    "thus , we analyze again the general scheme shown in figure 2 with @xmath232 . as an example",
    ", we give a solution for @xmath233 to be as follows : @xmath234 r_5 t_5   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & e^{i \\xi_5 } [ e^{i \\xi_2 } r_1 t_1 ( 3 r_2 ^ 2 -2 t_2 ^ 2 ) t_3 -e^{i \\xi_3 } g_1 r_2 r_3 ] r_4 g_5 \\}.\\qquad \\label{n49}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solutions for @xmath235 with @xmath236 are quite lengthy so , we do not present them explicitly here .",
    "nevertheless , they have been used in our numerical search of the bs and ps parameters satisfying condition ( [ n20 ] ) for @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we have found various solutions for which @xmath237 .",
    "we just mention a solution for the bs transmittances equal to @xmath92 = [ 0.75572 , 0.41783 , 0.32503 , 0.83274 , 0.50338 ] , @xmath116 and the other phase shifts equal to zero , which results in the constant nonzero amplitude @xmath235 for @xmath238 , and obviously vanishing for @xmath239 .",
    "another solution is found for the same phase shifts but transmittances equal to @xmath92=[0.58154 , 0.28519 , 0.46753 , 0.68558 , 0.49836 ] , which results also in a constant @xmath235 but one that slightly lower than that in the former case .",
    "now , we address an important problem from an experimental point of view that concerns the deterioration effects of system imperfections on the fidelity of truncation and teleportation . to analyze such effects one can follow the approaches of , for example , @xcite applied to the pegg - phillips - barnett qsd . here , we focus on imperfect photodetection .",
    "photon counting in mode @xmath240 by an imperfect detector with a finite efficiency @xmath241 and a mean dark count rate @xmath242 can be described by a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xcite with the following elements @xcite @xmath243 summing up to the identity operator @xmath244 . in ( [ n50 ] ) , @xmath245 is the number of registered photocounts in detector @xmath246 , @xmath138 is the actual number of photons entering detector , and @xmath247 is the number of dark counts , @xmath248 are binomial coefficients .",
    "the mean dark count rate @xmath249 in ( [ n50 ] ) is related to the standard dark count rate @xmath250 by the relation @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the detector resolution time . in analogy to the analysis of the pegg - phillips - barnett qsd given in @xcite , we compare the fidelities for the states truncated by the generalized scissors in relation to three types of applied detectors : ( i ) conventional photodetectors ( e.g. , avalanche photo - diodes , apds ) providing only a binary answer to the question whether any photons have been registered or not , thus described by the povm with the two elements : @xmath253 ( ii ) single - photon resolving photodetectors ( e.g. , visual light photon counters , vlpcs @xcite ) providing a trinary answer to the question whether zero , one or more than one photons have been registered , so given by the povm with the following three elements : @xmath254 where @xmath255 in ( [ n51 ] ) and ( [ n52 ] ) are given by ( [ n50 ] ) .",
    "( iii ) and unrealistic detectors ( labeled by @xmath256 ) resolving any number of simultaneously absorbed photons described by the povm elements @xmath257 , given by ( [ n50 ] ) for any @xmath245 .",
    "such detectors are not available , although some methods ( including the so - called photon chopping @xcite ) have been proposed to measure photon statistics with conventional devices . by including the imperfect photon counting by detectors d2 , d3 and d4",
    ", the output state at mode @xmath258 can be described by the following density matrix @xmath259 where the partial trace is taken over the detected modes @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 ; @xmath263 are the povm elements for a given type of detectors @xmath264 ; @xmath49 is the four - mode output state , given by ( [ n12 ] ) , and @xmath144 is the normalization . for simplicity",
    ", we can assume identical detectors with @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "deviation of the realistically truncated state @xmath267 from the ideally truncated state @xmath268 is usually described by the fidelity @xmath269 in our numerical analysis we assume : ( i ) @xmath270 and @xmath271 for conventional detectors ( see e.g. @xcite ) , ( ii ) @xmath272 and @xmath273 for single - photon detectors ( vlpcs ) as experimentally achieved by takeuchi _",
    "et al _ @xcite , ( iii ) for theoretic photon - number resolving detectors we choose the same @xmath274 and @xmath250 as in ( ii ) .",
    "moreover , we put @xmath275 ns . we observe that the truncation fidelity in the system with imperfect photodetection depends on the chosen transmittances .",
    "in particular , different solutions described in section 4 for perfect truncation ( with @xmath276 ) in the lossless system correspond not only to different probabilities of success but also to different fidelities of the truncation in the lossy system . for @xmath277 , we find that the fidelity for the truncation up to quartit states in the system described by the transmittances given below equation ( [ n31 ] ) drop from one to @xmath278 for the conventional detectors and to @xmath279 for the vlpcs and the photon - number resolving detectors .",
    "the fidelities of the truncation up to five - dimensional states in the system described in section 6 are estimated to be @xmath280 for the conventional detectors , @xmath281 for the vlpcs , and @xmath282 for the photon - number resolving detectors if @xmath277 .",
    "these estimations show that the conventional photodetectors can effectively be used for the low - intensity - field truncations described in sections 35 , where at most single - photon detections are required . in the schemes described in sections 6 and 7 , where detections of two - photons are important , one has to apply at least single - photon resolving detectors even in the low - intensity limit .",
    "it is worth noting that by increasing the number of detectors and beam splitters in the discussed pyramid configuration , one can achieve truncations to higher - dimensional states by detecting no or single photons only @xcite . in our estimation",
    "we have assumed , based on @xcite , relatively high values of the dark count rates .",
    "however , it has recently been experimentally demonstrated by babichev _",
    "et al _ , by rigorously synchronizing the photon count events , that the dark counts can be reduced to a negligible level @xcite .",
    "as multiport optical interferometers have already been experimentally realized @xcite , thus it seems that the proposed gqsd for the truncation and teleportation of at least quartit states is accessible to experiments with present - day technology for low - intensity incident fields .",
    "we are aware that our analysis of the quantum state truncation via a gqsd is not yet complete . among open problems to be analyzed to a greater detail we should mention : ( i ) a generalization of the scheme for the truncation of an arbitrary @xmath0-dimensional qudit states based on the @xmath283-port interferometer in the triangle configuration with the top bs removed . by symmetry of the scheme , shown in figure 2 ,",
    "such generalization is straightforward , e.g. , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "however , it would be desirable to find the minimum number of detections in the multiport qsd , which enables the state truncation to a qudit state of a given dimensionality .",
    "( ii ) an analysis of other kinds of losses ( including mode mismatch in addition to imperfect photon - counting ) in the generalized optical state truncation .",
    "( iii ) a detailed experimental proposal of the scheme for the truncation at least to qutrit and quartit states .",
    "( iv ) a hard problem is the optimalization of solutions for the bs parameters to obtain the highest probability of the truncation for @xmath284 .",
    "these problems are being under our current investigation @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed a generalization of the pegg - phillips - barnett six - port qsd ( shown in figure 1 ) to the eight - port optical interferometer , depicted in figure 2 .",
    "the analyzed system enables , upon post - selection based on photon counting results , generation and teleportation of qudit states ( for @xmath17 ) by truncation of an input optical field at the @xmath1th term of its fock - state expansion .",
    "we have discussed examples of selective truncations , which enable fock - state filtering and hole burning in the fock space of an input optical field .",
    "we have also analyzed deterioration of the truncation fidelity due to realistic photon counting including finite photon - number resolution , inefficiency and dark counts of photodetectors .",
    "our estimations suggest that the scheme is experimentally feasible at least for the generation and teleportation of quartit states of low - intensity incident fields .",
