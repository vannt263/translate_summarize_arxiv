    "locally , the ultraviolet ionizing background ( uvb ) may be responsible for the ionization of the hydrogen clouds located in the galactic halo ( ferrara & field 1994 ) , and for producing the abrupt truncation in the h  i distribution at the edge of nearby spiral galaxies ( bochkarev & sunyaev 1977 ) .",

    "they included the reprocessing of ultraviolet radiation by intergalactic material , and showed that qso absorption - line systems are sources , not just sinks of ionizing photons . the resulting metagalactic flux at the lyman edge is found to increase from @xmath11 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 at the present - epoch to @xmath12 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 at @xmath13 .",

    "it is interesting to notice that , since the opacity of the igm at @xmath65 is low , galaxies at intermediate redshifts can provide a non negligible contribution to the local metagalactic flux .",
    "the current limits on the uvb from h@xmath6-brightness studies in fact provide the most stringent constraints to the total ionizing emissivity at @xmath66 , where the bulk of the blue galaxy evolution is observed .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , an escape fraction of @xmath64% implies a total uvb of @xmath67 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 at @xmath68 .",
    "if the contribution of the blue galaxies to the metagalactic flux extends to @xmath69 , i.e. if the escape fraction of lyc photons into the igm is significant even at early epochs , it is possible to envisage a scenario where the background intensity remains nearly constant , @xmath70 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 , from @xmath71 to @xmath15 , i.e. for a fraction of 50% of the age of the universe .",

    "an independent estimate of @xmath76 at high redshifts comes from the statistical study of the proximity effect in the spectra of qsos ( bajtlik , duncan , & ostriker 1988 ; bechtold 1994 ) .",
    "the value recently derived from a large high resolution sample of lyman-@xmath6 forest lines is @xmath82 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 , constant in the redshift range @xmath83 ( giallongo et al .",
    "1996 ) . as a direct consequence , while in a qso - dominated background model the photoionization rate will remain approximately constant from @xmath84 to @xmath85 , to drop by a factor of @xmath86 by the present epoch , in a universe in which star - forming galaxies contribute significantly to the metagalactic flux , @xmath76 may only decrease by a factor @xmath87 from @xmath88 to the present epoch .",

    "the volume filling factor is proportional to the number of systems along the line of sight and depends on the cloud geometry , while the gas density is a measure of the photoionization state of the absorbers ( madau & shull 1996 ) , @xmath106 .",
    "the temperature dependence is very weak for highly photoionized clouds : a value of @xmath107 k has been adopted here . the aspect ratio @xmath108 generalizes the absorber geometry from spheres to disks of transverse radii r to half - thickness @xmath109 . for @xmath110 the usual limit of spherical clouds is obtained .",
    "hence , the cosmological mass density produced by the ly@xmath6 clouds is proportional to @xmath111 where @xmath112 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath2 hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 , @xmath113 kpc , @xmath114 k , @xmath115 is the spectral slope of the ionizing uvb and b(z ) is the number of lines per unit @xmath116 and unit redshift interval derived at given redshifts from the observed spectra as in giallongo et al .",

    "we have adopted a lower @xmath124 cutoff of @xmath91 @xmath2 as derived from high resolution data ( webb et al . 1992 , giallongo et al . 1995 , hu et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the cloud size and geometry are subject to substantial uncertainties .",
    "an estimate of the characteristic size of absorbers is provided by the statistical coincidence of absorption lines in closely separated quasar pairs .",

    "the ensuing cosmological baryon density due to lyman-@xmath6 clouds is shown in figure 2 from @xmath9 to @xmath133 as a function of cosmic time .",
    "the redshift dependence of the baryon density of photoionized gas is associated with the product @xmath134 where the dominant factor is the number density evolution of the clouds .",
    "two different evolutionary scenarios can be envisaged at this point , depending on the sources of the ionizing background . in figure 2_a _   @xmath135 has been computed for a qso - dominated uvb . in figure 2_b",
    "_ both galaxies and qsos contribute to the metagalactic flux .",
    "in the redshift interval @xmath83 , the uvb assumes the constant value @xmath136 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 , as derived from the proximity effect .",
    "the increase of the baryon density at higher redshifts is due to the increase of the number density of lyman-@xmath6 lines , which is partly compensated by the decrease of the average cloud sizes .",
    "lyman-@xmath6 absorbers at @xmath137 can easily account for all the baryons in the universe predicted by nucleosynthesis , @xmath138 ( walker et al .",
    "note that a large aspect ratio , @xmath139 , must be adopted to avoid @xmath120 values significantly in excess of the nucleosynthesis constraints , as outlined by rauch & haehnelt ( 1995 ) .",
    "the residual baryon density is already about 30% at @xmath125 ( i.e. , @xmath140 gyr ) .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath141 the number density of lyman-@xmath6 clouds stays nearly constant and the evolution of the density parameter depends mainly on the evolution of the ionizing sources contributing to the uvb and of the cloud size . in any case , a further decrease of @xmath120 is present in the redshift interval @xmath142 .",
    "this evolution is stronger in the case of a qso - dominated uvb where a value of @xmath143 is found at @xmath144 . in a galaxy - dominated uvb",
    "the evolution is slower and @xmath145 at the same redshift .",
    "these values are larger than the baryonic `` visible '' mass density of galaxies , @xmath146 ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) .",
    "we have presented here two main results .",
    "first , we have computed the integrated emission of ionizing photons from the _ observed _ population of star - forming galaxies at @xmath20 , and shown that it may equal or even exceed the overall qso contribution to the uvb in this redshift range if the mean fraction of uv photons which can escape from individual galaxies into the igm is not negligible .",
    "we have shown in   2 that @xmath147 is constrained to be @xmath148 , in order to satisfy the upper limit on the intensity of the local uvb .",
    "if we adopt @xmath149 as a fiducial value for the escape fraction , the ensuing uvb is found to evolve little in the redshift interval between @xmath71 and @xmath15 .",
    "we have also shown that the baryon fraction which is associated with the photoionized ly@xmath6 clouds appears to decrease rapidly with cosmic time . at @xmath150 ,",
    "@xmath120 may account for all of the nucleosynthesis baryons of the universe . as shown in   3",
    ", the mass density parameter depends only weakly on the intensity , @xmath76 , of the uvb , with @xmath151",
    ". hence tighter constraints on the escape fraction from galaxies are unlikely to change qualitatively the evolution of @xmath120 ( see fig .",
    "the dependence of @xmath120 on the typical cloud radius and geometry is also relatively weak , @xmath152 .",
    "moreover , in cdm scenarios , lines with @xmath153 @xmath2 have typical sizes which appear essentially uncorrelated with the column ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "thus , while the exact normalization of @xmath120 depends on these values , it is difficult to explain the strong evolution inferred in the redshift interval @xmath154 as a simple geometrical effect .",
    "note that photoionization models and the statistics of coincident absorptions in qso pairs suggest a typical cloud thickness in the range @xmath155 kpc , independently of the assumed aspect ratio ( fang et al .",
    "1996 ) . at @xmath150 , the baryon content of the lyman-@xmath6 forest clouds",
    "may then be significant both in the case of spherical or disk - like geometry .",
    "we can parameterize the cosmological evolution of @xmath120 as an exponentially decreasing function with cosmic time , @xmath156 . as shown in figure 2 ,",
    "this yields two characteristic @xmath157-folding timescales , @xmath158 gyr for @xmath159 gyr and @xmath160 gyr at later epochs .",
    "thus , roughly 60% of the photoionized gas in the universe `` disappears '' at early epochs over a timescale which is much shorter that the hubble time .",
    "what is the fate of these `` missing '' baryons ?",
    "they are unlikely to fragment into stars , as the baryonic visible mass density of galaxies today is known to be only a small fraction of the value derived from cosmological nucleosynthesis .",
    "the decrease of @xmath161 observed in the ly@xmath6 line population must mainly reflects either a dilution of the photoionized gas clouds in a general diffuse intergalactic medium or an increase of the fraction of the igm which is collisionally ionized at temperatures @xmath162 k by supernovae shocks .",
    "if a strong evolution in the neutral column density of clouds were present following the hubble flow , it would produce at @xmath163 lines ten times weaker ( @xmath164 ) than at @xmath165 .",
    "however , since the contribution to @xmath161 increases slowly for decreasing @xmath116 ( @xmath166 for @xmath167 ) , lines ten times weaker in @xmath116 increase @xmath168 only by @xmath169 when @xmath18 decreases from @xmath170 to @xmath171 ( i.e. from @xmath172 gyr to @xmath173 gyr ) .",
    "thus the strong @xmath168 evolution derived in the redshift interval @xmath154 can not be mainly due to a decrease ( with decreasing redshift ) of the lower cutoff of the @xmath116 distribution unless the sizes evolved much faster than assumed in this simple model .",
    "a plausible possibility appears to be the additional heating of the absorbing gas at temperatures @xmath174 k by the gravitational accretion into progressively more massive halos , with higher velocity dispersions , or by collisional ionization from supernovae winds .",
    "the easiest way for finding collisionally ionized , cosmologically distributed material at @xmath175 k is to search for absorption .",
    "is most prevalent at these temperatures , while lines are stronger than those of for @xmath176 k. the recent results of the first survey for 1032 , 1038  absorption lines in qso spectra ( burles & tytler 1996 ) suggest the presence of a substantial cosmological mass density of hot , collisionally ionized gas at @xmath21 .",
    "if the bulk heating were mainly due to supernovae explosions in spheroidal systems , as suggested by recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ) , the strong evolution of @xmath120 observed between @xmath88 and @xmath15 could be triggered by the star - formation activity in galaxies at high redshift .",
    "note that , while an @xmath157-folding timescale of only 1 gyr is much shorter than the decay time of star formation , @xmath177 gyr , characteristic of late type spirals , it is comparable with the decay time of star formation characteristic of `` average '' quiescent elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot 1993 ) . various authors have argued in favour of a significant contribution to the uvb by star - forming galaxies ( bechtold et al .",
    "1987 ; miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 ; madau 1991 ; madau & shull 1996 ) .",
    "order - of - magnitude arguments suggest that the overall kinetic energy released in supernova explosions can be about one - third of the radiative uv power ( miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 ) . in this case",
    "a highly photoionized igm at @xmath178 k may be quickly heated to temperatures 10 times larger ( giroux & shapiro 1996 ) .",
    "if this scenario will be confirmed by new observational constraints on @xmath90 and @xmath76 and by detailed theoretical models , then the evolution of the lyman-@xmath6 forest clouds may be used as a probe of the cosmic star formation rate as a function of time ."
