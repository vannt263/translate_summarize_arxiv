    "determining when neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was reionized is an important question in observational cosmology and a precursor to understanding whether star forming galaxies provided the necessary uv photons @xcite .",
    "one of the most practical probes of reionization with current facilities utilizes the frequency of occurrence of ly@xmath0 emission in star forming galaxies . as ly@xmath0 photons",
    "are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , the abundance of ly@xmath0 emitters should decrease as observations probe into the era where there is neutral gas ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the recent discovery of large numbers of candidate galaxies beyond @xmath6 through multi - color imaging undertaken with the infrared wide field camera ( wfc3/ir ) onboard hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) now makes it feasible to track the occurrence of ly@xmath0 line emission to interesting redshifts where neutral hydrogen may be present .    of course ,",
    "astrophysical factors other than a neutral igm can also affect the presence of ly@xmath0 emission . because of this , an alternative approach for gauging when reionization occurred , introduced by @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , is to spectroscopically measure _ the fraction of ly@xmath0 emission within color - selected lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) populations_. tracking the redshift - dependent fraction in a well - defined population avoids consideration of absolute changes in the host galaxy number density such as has been the case in studies based on the luminosity function of narrow - band selected lyman @xmath0 emitters ( laes ) .",
    "furthermore , evolution in dust obscuration can be independently tracked via correlations seen with the colors of the rest - frame uv continuum .",
    "paper i presented a comprehensive survey of over 600 lbgs with deep spectra , mostly undertaken with the deimos instrument on keck , but including published samples from the very large telescope ( vlt , @xcite and references therein ) . in that paper",
    "we demonstrated the utility of the method and discussed the paucity of line emission in gravitationally - lensed @xmath7 candidates from the sample of @xcite .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper ii )",
    ", through ultra - deep exposures with deimos we significantly improved the line emission statistics at @xmath8 , providing a robust measure of the rest - frame ew distribution of ly@xmath0 emission at the highest redshift when the universe is believed to be fully ionized ( @xcite , c.f .",
    "this provides a sound basis for predicting the likelihood of emission at higher redshift and thereby enabling a test of whether there is absorption by neutral gas .",
    "significantly , we found that over 50% of moderately - faint ( @xmath9 ) @xmath8 lbgs exhibit strong emission with rest frame ews @xmath10",
    " . as this fraction increases over @xmath2 , we argued on continuity grounds that we should expect a high success rate in recovering line emission from the newly - found wfc3/ir samples of @xmath7 lbgs _ unless _ we encounter a more neutral igm in the short time interval prior to @xmath11 .",
    "some evidence for this is seen in the recent studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the present paper is concerned with an initial application of this test to the newly - available sample of wfc3/ir candidates with photometric redshifts in the redshift range @xmath3 .",
    "two important factors have motivated and shaped our program .",
    "firstly , it is important to note that ly@xmath0 emission is the only spectroscopic redshift indicator for galaxies beyond @xmath8 . since it is the absence of strong ly@xmath0 emission that provides the basis for considering an increased neutral fraction , it is important to be sure that the targets are truly at the expected redshifts .",
    "many early candidate lbgs believed to lie beyond @xmath12 remained controversial because of their limited or marginal photometry .",
    "the improved filter set and superior performance of wfc3/ir has given us confidence that the current list of @xmath13 candidates is more robust than those based on earlier nicmos data @xcite .",
    "secondly , to match the lower redshift data , sampling from a similarly wide range of lbg luminosities , as we do here , will be advantageous .",
    "as shown in papers i and ii , the fraction of line emission increases in intrinsically fainter sources and so by comparing fractions with respect to their lbg luminosities , we may gain additional evidence for the onset of the neutral era .    throughout the paper , we adopt a @xmath14-dominated , flat universe with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . all magnitudes in this paper are quoted in the ab system @xcite .",
    "in compiling a target list for this program , we are guided by the need for a robust photometric redshift for each galaxy based on improved photometry from wfc3/ir and a range of rest - frame uv luminosities ( @xmath18   ( paper i ) ] ) .",
    "our primary source of targets for the wide - field multi - slit capabilities of the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) on the keck i telescope @xcite equipped with a new red - sensitive ccd was @xmath19 and @xmath20-drop candidates whose photometric redshifts @xmath21 from the hst early release science ( ers ) field @xcite .",
    "the grating for these observations was blazed at 600 lines mm@xmath22 . on january 7 and february 4 2011",
    "we secured 7 hours of on - source integration for 8 suitable targets on a single mask using slit widths of 1@xmath23 , observed through a median seeing of 0.98@xmath23 .",
    "in a more ambitious campaign probing to higher redshift we also targeted 3 @xmath20-drop sources from the hubble ultradeep field ( hudf ) p34 field ( go 11563 , pi : illingworth ) and an additional gravitationally - lensed source in the cluster ms0451 - 03 ( go 11591 , pi : kneib ) using the near - infrared spectrograph nirspec @xcite during november 14 - 17 2010 and jan 14 - 15 2011 .",
    "this extends our search for ly@xmath0 emission up to a redshift @xmath24 . although we undertook extended integrations on all 4 sources with a 0.76@xmath23 slit , tracking difficulties affected some exposures . to determine the effective on - source integration time , we secured our astrometric position for each exposure by locating objects visible in the slit viewing camera to a precision of @xmath25 0.2@xmath23 .",
    "we continued this campaign over may 15 - 18 2011 . during these 4 nights",
    ", we did not encounter any tracking difficulties and , in excellent conditions , successfully used nirspec to study an additional 7 wfc3-ir dropouts drawn from numerous surveys : the borg pure parallel survey @xcite ( also independently discovered by @xcite ) , the egs region in candels ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the lensing clusters abell 1703 ( go 10325 , pi : ford , @xcite ) and abell 2261 ( clash survey , @xcite ) .",
    "we reduce the lris data following standard procedures , with bias subtraction and flat - fielding using dome exposures .",
    "we used the @xcite code to remove spatial and spectral distortion and to model and subtract the sky emission .",
    "wavelength calibration was determined directly from sky lines .",
    "a final two - dimensional spectrum was extracted for each object with pixels binned logarithmically by @xmath26log@xmath27 . as in papers i and ii , we search through the two - dimensional spectrum visually to identify emission lines , and confirm these with a boxcar extracted one - dimensional spectrum .    our exposures with nirspec were conducted with typical spatial dithering of 5@xmath23 . in the case of some lensed sources",
    ", we dithered by longer amounts to ensure the arc was oriented along the slit , and was not spatially coincident with any background objects .",
    "we flat - fielded and sky - subtracted the spectra using idl routines written by g. becker ( 2010 , private communication ) . to compute the camera distortion and spectral curvature",
    ", we fit traces of standard stars along the slit , and skylines perpendicular to the slit . from this , we then derive a wavelength and sky position for all pixels in each two - dimensional spectrum , which were used to align the individual exposures .",

    "two key factors enter into the calculation of the visibility of line emission in a ground - based survey .",
    "firstly , for any target with a particular photometric redshift likelihood function @xmath70 , it may be that the spectral region surveyed by lris or nirspec does not completely cover the expected wavelength range where ly@xmath0 might be present .",
    "secondly , the ew limit for ly@xmath0 emission will be a highly non - uniform function of wavelength due to the mitigating effect of night sky emission .",
    "provided the photometric redshift solution we derive is robust , we can estimate both factors and hence derive the likelihood of seeing ly@xmath0 for each of our 26 sources assuming the relevant wavelength range studied and the exposure time secured , if the particular source of a given @xmath71 has a ew distribution drawn from the sample with @xmath56 .    in the case of those sources for which the wavelength range searched does not fully sample the extended @xmath70 , we reduce the detection likelihood by the fraction of the integrated @xmath70 that lies outside our search range . for each target , we determine its redshift probability function @xmath70 using the photometric redshift code eazy @xcite . to determine the varying visibility function within our search range",
    ", we first estimate the the noise within an aperture encompassing the expected profile of the line , assuming an emission line width of 10   fwhm which is typical of those detected in paper ii .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the 5@xmath4 ew limit as a function of wavelength ( and ly@xmath0 redshift ) for most sources in our 12 hour lris exposure ( @xmath72 ) and a typical source studied with nirspec ( @xmath73 ) during a 5 hour exposure .",
    "we note that although our survey spans a large range in redshift ( @xmath3 ) , the @xmath70 distributions for individual galaxies typically span a much smaller range .",
    "the average 1@xmath4 redshift confidence interval for sources in our sample is only @xmath74 = 0.43 .    since the nirspec exposures were usually single - object exposures ,",
    "the limits vary from source to source depending on the conditions and exposure times .",
    "we then apply a completeness correction to account for the fact that an emission line may fall in a noise trough and lie undetected , despite having an intrinsic flux above the 5@xmath4 limit . to estimate this completeness correction",
    ", we follow the methods discussed in detail in paper ii , where we simulate the addition and recovery of fake line emission in our actual spectra , again assuming a fwhm of 10  .",
    "as the absolute limits vary from source to source our keck survey is not complete to a fixed ew limit but , provided the limits are well - understood for each source , we can readily estimate the probability of seeing ly@xmath0 in our exposures . in the case of the @xcite fors2 survey we estimated the night sky emission from our own lris exposures normalizing the limits from numerical data supplied in that paper .",

    "of course our observed decrease in the ly@xmath0 fraction could also be attributed to an increased opacity arising from dust within the lbgs .",

    "such a complementary campaign targeting luminous lbgs selected from larger volumes will provide further insight into whether reionization is responsible for the declining fraction of line emission .",

    "<S> using deep keck spectroscopy of lyman break galaxies selected from infrared imaging data taken with the wide field camera 3 onboard the hubble space telescope , we present new evidence for a reversal in the redshift - dependent fraction of star forming galaxies with detectable lyman alpha ( ly@xmath0 ) emission in the redshift range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our earlier surveys with the deimos spectrograph demonstrated a significant increase with redshift in the fraction of line emitting galaxies over the interval @xmath2 , particularly for intrinsically faint systems which dominate the luminosity density . using the longer wavelength sensitivities of lris and nirspec , we have targeted 19 lyman break galaxies selected using recent wfc3/ir data whose photometric redshifts are in the range @xmath3 and which span a wide range of intrinsic luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopic exposures typically reach a 5@xmath4 sensitivity of @xmath5   for the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of ly@xmath0 emission . despite the high fraction of emitters seen only a few hundred million years later </S>",
    "<S> , we find only 2 convincing and 1 possible line emitter in our more distant sample . </S>",
    "<S> combining with published data on a further 7 sources obtained using fors2 on the eso vlt , and assuming continuity in the trends found at lower redshift , we discuss the significance of this apparent reversal in the redshift - dependent ly@xmath0 fraction in the context of our range in continuum luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> assuming all the targeted sources are at their photometric redshift and our assumptions about the ly@xmath0 ew distribution are correct , we would expect to find so few emitters in less than 1% of the realizations drawn from our lower redshift samples . </S>",
    "<S> our new results provide further support for the suggestion that , at the redshifts now being probed spectroscopically , we are entering the era where the intergalactic medium is partially neutral . with the arrival of more sensitive multi - slit infrared spectrographs </S>",
    "<S> , the prospects for improving the statistical validity of this result are promising . </S>"
