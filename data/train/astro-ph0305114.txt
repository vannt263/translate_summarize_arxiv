    "when the sample is enlarged to include more distant sne  ia , there are several subluminous events that broaden the variation to about 1  mag .  in @xmath10 ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the bulk of the sne  ia  sample have peak brightnesses within a 0.5  mag .  range in @xmath10 and @xmath5 .",
    "an interesting feature of sne  ia  is that the luminosity is set not by the explosion , for which the deposited energy goes into expansion , but rather by the decay of @xmath0  and @xmath11 that are formed during the nucleosynthesis @xcite . at the time of peak luminosity , @xmath11 has not yet decayed , and hence the peak luminosity is a measurement of the amount of @xmath0  synthesized during the explosion .",
    "this amount presumably depends on the progenitor and on the details of the explosion .",
    "in particular , it has long been known that the amount of @xmath0  synthesized depends in part on the asymmetry between neutrons and protons in the progenitor white dwarf ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we explore how the intrinsic variation in the initial cno abundances of the progenitors translates into a variation in the mass of @xmath0  synthesized ( @xmath12 ) and hence in the peak luminosity of sne  ia .",
    "we show analytically , using mass and charge conservation , that @xmath12 depends _ linearly _ on the initial metallicity @xmath13 , and that the observed variation in the @xmath13 of field dwarfs , from  to 3 times solar , leads to a @xmath14 variation in @xmath12 , with most of the effect occurring at @xmath15 .",
    "this is the expected variation if sne  ia  progenitors uniformly represent the range of cno abundances observed in stars today .",
    "our conclusion rests on ( 1 ) considerations of nuclear equilibrium during the explosion , and ( 2 ) the observed scatter in @xmath13 of stars within the galactic disk .",
    "the dependence of the ejected @xmath0  mass on the progenitor s initial @xmath13 has been investigated previously , both via the evolution of the progenitor ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter d01 ) and the explosion itself ( @xcite ; @xcite ; d01 ) . although these one - dimensional simulations are sophisticated in their treatment of the flame microphysics and the nuclear burning , we desire to elucidate features that are robust to any complicated hydrodynamics .",
    "our demonstration that the mass of nickel depends linearly on the initial @xmath13 of the progenitor serves as a check and stimulus for future numerical studies and provides insight into possible evolutionary effects .    in   [ sec : variation - ni - mass ]",
    "we demonstrate the linear dependence of @xmath12 on the progenitor s @xmath13 , and compare this with detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and previous numerical work .",
    "we speculate on the source of differences between different calculations , and then discuss the intrinsic scatter in cno abundances in the ism (   [ sec : scatter - metallicity ] ) and the implications (   [ sec : implications ] ) of our results .",
    "nearly all one - dimensional chandrasekhar mass models of sne  ia  produce most of their @xmath0  in a burn to nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) between the mass shells 0.2@xmath1@xmath2  and 0.8@xmath1@xmath2(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this region , unlike in the innermost 0.2@xmath1@xmath2  @xcite",

    "the @xmath0  mass is affected only slightly , however , as the charge - to - mass of @xmath16 ( which sets the slope in eq .",

( [ eq : x56 ] ) is robust , as it only relies on basic properties of nse . as a test of this analytical result , we calculated the mass of @xmath0  ejected by w7-like models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) by integrating a 510 isotope nuclear reaction network over the thermodynamical trajectories for a wide range of @xmath13 .",

    "most of the differences between eq .",

    "the difference between the slope given by the detailed w7-like models and the analytical model is less than 5% .",

    "both of these works relied on post - processing the thermodynamical trajectories , as we have done .",
    "recently , d01 investigated the range @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",

    "[ fig : mni56 ] , the largest variation in the mass of @xmath0  occurs at @xmath15 .",
    "we note that the calculations of d01 evolve a main - sequence star into the sne  ia  progenitor , whereas our calculation and those of @xcite start from a given white dwarf configuration .    as a caveat",
    ", we note that our post - processing of the w7 thermodynamic trajectories is not completely self - consistent .",
    "the reason is that the temperature and density profiles of the w7 were calculated using the energy released by burning matter of solar @xmath13 . while @xmath13 is likely to influence the flame propagation ( via the change in the rate of energy production ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , in the mass range under consideration si - burning is complete , so our assumption of nse still holds .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the mass of @xmath0  synthesized was also rather insensitive to the details of the flame microphysics .",
    "it is also possible the density , @xmath57 , at which a transition from deflagration to detonation occurs will influence the amount of @xmath0produced ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". fits to observations seem to require , however , that @xmath58 which corresponds to a lagrangian mass coordinate of @xmath59 1.0@xmath1@xmath2 , which is exterior to the main @xmath0-producing layers .",
    "further numerical studies should elucidate the source of the discrepancy .",
    "in particular they should determine if other effects , such as a systematic change in the mass coordinates where most of the @xmath0  is produced , offsets or enhances the variation in @xmath12 that we find .",
    "the demonstrated linear dependence between @xmath12 and @xmath13 will make it easier to untangle competing physical effects in a fully self - consistent calculation .",
    "stellar abundance determinations are discussed in terms of an elemental abundance relative to iron , @xmath60 $ ] , as a function of the iron to hydrogen ratio @xmath61 $ ] , primarily because @xmath61 $ ]  is relatively easy to measure in stars .",

    "the @xmath13 of local field stars rapidly increased about 1013@xmath1@xmath62@xmath63  ago during formation of the galaxy s disk and then increased much more gradually over the last @xmath64 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . more importantly for our purposes",
    ", however , is the relatively large scatter in stellar metallicities , @xmath65}}\\sim 0.5 $ ] , at any given age .",
    "@xcite constructed an age - metallicity diagram for 5828 dwarf and sub - dwarf stars from the hipparcos catalog using evolutionary tracks to derive ages and strmgren photometry to derive metallicities .",
    "they concluded that the age - metallicity diagram is well - populated at all ages , that old , metal - rich stars do exist , and that the scatter in @xmath13 at any given age is larger than the observational errors .",
    "other surveys of stellar metallicities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are in good agreement with these trends .    the most abundant elements in the galaxy after h and he are cno .",
    "both @xmath66 $ ]  and @xmath67 $ ]  in halo and disk dwarfs are observed to be roughly solar and constant ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath68 $ ]  ratio is larger at low metallicities ",
    "oxygen being the dominant element ejected by sne  ii  and",
    "then slowly decreases due to variations in mass and @xmath13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . within these general trends is a relatively large scatter , @xmath69}}\\sim \\delta{\\ensuremath{[\\mathrm{n / fe}]}}\\sim \\delta{\\ensuremath{[\\mathrm{o / fe}]}}\\sim { \\ensuremath{0.5{{\\ensuremath{\\,}}}\\mathrm{dex}}}$ ] , at any given @xmath61 $ ] .    according to the simple analytical relation ( eq .  [ [ eq : x56 ] ] ) and the detailed w7-like models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mni56 ] ) , a scatter of a factor of 3 about the mean in the initial metallicity ( @xmath70 ) leads to a variation of about 25% ( 0.13@xmath1@xmath2 ) in the mass of @xmath0  ejected by sne  ia  if the @xmath8  and @xmath24 are uniformly distributed within the white dwarf .",
    "the minimum peak brightness variations caused by this variation in @xmath0  mass are @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "thus , the amplitude of this effect can not account for all of the observed variation in peak luminosity of local sne  ia  ( 0.5  magnitude in @xmath10 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the observed scatter in peak brightnesses may be even larger , as cepheid - based distances to the host galaxies of peculiar events such as sub - luminous sn  1991bg or brighter - than - normal sn  1991 t havent been measured yet ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is evidence for a larger scatter when more distant supernovae are included @xcite .",
    "it would take a scatter of about a factor of seven ( @xmath65}}\\sim { \\ensuremath{0.8{{\\ensuremath{\\,}}}\\mathrm{dex}}}$ ] ) in the initial @xmath13 to account for a factor of two variation in the @xmath0  mass and peak luminosity .",
    "using the properties of nse , we find that where weak interactions are unimportant the mass fraction of @xmath0  produced depends linearly upon the initial metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor .",
    "this result is robust : so long as the region that reaches nse does so on a timescale over which @xmath3  is nearly constant , then the mass of @xmath0  produced is largely independent of the detailed physics of the flame front propagation .",
    "this fact offers a check on sophisticated numerical calculations and could be exploited to understand better the disagreements between different codes .",
    "the variation from  to 3 times solar metallicity observed in dwarf stars in the galactic disk implies that sne  ia  should have a minimum variation of 25% in the ejected @xmath0  mass .",
    "this has implications for the brightness variations observed in both near and distant sne  ia  and for galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the most distant sne  ia  observed today have redshifts @xmath72 .",
    "this corresponds to a lookback time of about 47@xmath1@xmath62@xmath63 depending on the cosmological model , and implies a mean @xmath61 $ ]  ratio between -0.1 and -0.3 .",
    "there is , however , still a scatter of @xmath65}}\\sim 0.5 $ ] at these mean @xmath61$]ratios ( see the discussion in   3 ) .",
    "we therefore expect that the variation in peak luminosities of sne  ia  in spiral galaxies at @xmath72 will show the same minimum variation of @xmath71 in peak luminosity as nearby sne  ia .",
    "this variation is superposed on other evolutionary effects , such as that from a reduction in the c / o ratio ( @xcite ; d01 ) .    for combustion to nse with no freeze - out",
    "( see   2 ) , the @xmath0  mass is anticorrelated with the mass of @xmath17  and @xmath16 ejected , and subluminous sne  ia  will tend , therefore , to have larger @xmath73  ratios than brighter ones . because sne  ia  produce @xmath74 of the galactic iron - peak nuclei of iron - group nuclei while type ii sne produce @xmath75 , and the ratio of thermonuclear to core collapse events is about 0.150.27 in the galaxy @xcite . ] , the isotopic ratios among the iron group in sne  ia  ejecta should not exceed the solar ratios by about a factor of two@xcite .",
    "there are several uncertainties with the @xmath73  ratio .",
    "first , some of the @xmath17  is produced in the core where weak interactions are important for determining the final @xmath3  ( although this may be alleviated by the overturning of matter in the core from rayleigh - taylor instabilities ; see @xcite for a recent calculation ) . at high densities",

    "isotopic measurements of cosmic rays , such as with _ ulysses _ ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and _ ace",
    "_ @xcite can probe the evolution of @xmath73  over the past @xmath76 .",
    "since most of the @xmath0  created in one - dimensional sne  ia  models lies in the 0.2@xmath1@xmath20.8@xmath1@xmath2  mass shell , our assumption of a uniform @xmath8  distribution deserves close scrutiny .",

    "the variability in @xmath0  production would increase to 50% , or about @xmath77 .",
