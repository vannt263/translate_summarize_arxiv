    "the formation and binary decay of light nuclear systems in the a@xmath8 @xmath9 60 mass region produced by low - energy ( e@xmath10 @xmath9 7 mev / nucleon ) heavy - ion reactions has been extensively studied both from the experimental and the theoretical points of view @xcite . in most of the reactions studied the binary breakup of the compound nucleus ( cn ) is seen as either a fusion - fission ( ff ) @xcite or a deep - inelastic ( di ) orbiting @xcite process .",
    "the large - angles orbiting yields are found to be particularly strong in the @xmath1si + @xmath2c reaction @xcite , as illustrated by fig .  1 which summarizes some of the experimental results that have been collected for this system ; i.e. , orbiting cross sections  @xcite and total evaporation residue ( er ) cross sections  @xcite .",
    "since many of the conjectured features for orbiting yields are similar to those expected for the ff mechanism , it is difficult to fully discount ff as a possible explanation for the large energy - damped @xmath1si + @xmath2c yields  @xcite . however , ff calculations  @xcite significantly underpredict the cross sections measured in the carbon channel by almost a factor of 3 , thus suggesting an alternative mechanism ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "ff , di orbiting , and even molecular - resonance behavior may all be active  @xcite in the large - angle yields of the @xmath1si + @xmath2c reaction  @xcite .",
    "the back - angle elastic scatterings of @xmath1si ions from @xmath2c displays structured excitation functions and oscillatory angular distributions in agreement with the relatively weak absorption of this system @xcite .",
    "moreover , the resonant gross structure  @xcite is fragmented into very striking intermediate width resonant structure  @xcite .",
    "superdeformed ( sd ) rotational bands have been found in various mass regions ( a = 60 , 80 , 130 , 150 and 190 ) and , very recently , sd bands have also been discovered in the n = z nuclei @xmath11ar  @xcite and @xmath0ca  @xcite .",
    "these new results make the a@xmath8 @xmath12 40 mass region of particular interest since quasimolecular resonances have also been observed in both the @xmath11ar and @xmath0ca dinuclear systems  @xcite .",
    "although there is no experimental evidence to link the sd bands with the higher lying rotational bands formed by known quasimolecular resonances , both phenomena are believed to originate from highly deformed configurations of these systems .",
    "since the detection of light charged particles ( lcp ) is relatively simple , the analysis of their spectral shapes is another good tool for exploring nuclear deformation and other properties of hot rotating nuclei at high angular momenta .",
    "experimental evidence for angular - momentum - dependent spectral shapes has already been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite and , in particular , the @xmath13 mg + @xmath14o reaction  @xcite , which reaches the @xmath0ca cn , has been studied in detail .",
    "strong deformation effects were also deduced from angular correlation data for the fusion reaction @xmath1si(@xmath2c,2@xmath4)@xmath6s@xmath15 at e@xmath10 = 70 mev  @xcite .",
    "we decided to investigate the @xmath0ca nucleus produced through the @xmath1si + @xmath2c reaction at beam energies of e@xmath10 = 112 mev and 180 mev .",
    "as can be observed in fig .  1",
    ", at the lowest incident energy of the present work the orbiting process is dominant whereas at e@xmath10 = 180 mev a large part of the o and n fully - damped yields may also result from a ff mechanism .",

    "the energy calibrations of the different telescopes of the icare multidetector array were done using radioactive @xmath27th and @xmath28am @xmath4-particle sources in the 5 - 9 mev energy range , a precision pulser , and elastic scatterings of 112 mev and 180 mev @xmath1si from @xmath29au , @xmath1si , and @xmath2c targets in a standard manner .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2c(@xmath14o,@xmath4)@xmath13mg@xmath30 reaction at e@xmath10 = 53 mev @xcite was used to provide known energies of @xmath4 particles feeding the @xmath13 mg excited states , thus allowing for calibration of the backward angle detectors .",
    "the proton calibration was achieved using scattered protons from formvar targets bombarded in reverse kinematics reactions with both @xmath1si and @xmath14o beams . on an event - by - event basis , corrections were applied for energy loss of heavy fragments ( a @xmath3 10 ) in the targets and in the entrance window mylar foils of the ic s and thin al - mylar foils of the si diodes , and for the pulse height defect in the si detectors .",

    "@xmath43k + @xmath20h , respectively . the apparent worsening of the agreement between the experimental and calculated @xmath4-particle spectra ( dashed circular arcs ) at larger angle results from the relatively large low - energy thresholds of the most backward - angle telescopes . despite these artifacts ,",

    "where the standard rotating liquid drop model ( rldm )  @xcite as well as the finite - range liquid drop model ( frldm )  @xcite still predict essentially spherical shapes , these sets of transmission coefficients have been found adequate in the considered mass region .",
    "however , in recent years it has been observed that when the angular momentum is increased to values for which frldm predicts significant deformations , statistical - model calculations using such standard parameters can not always predict satisfactorily the shape of the evaporated @xmath4-particle energy spectra @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we empirically modify the phase space open to statistical decay by lowering the yrast line with adjustment of the deformability parameters so as to fit the available experimental data  @xcite .",

    "was suggested earlier by blann and komoto  @xcite , but with the assumption that the deformation is a frozen degree of freedom through the decay chain .",
    "dynamical effects related to the shape relaxation during the de - excitation process have been incorporated into statistical - model codes  @xcite . for the cacarizo calculations done here , it is assumed that memory of formation details are lost after each step , with only the conserved quantities such as total energy and spin preserved during the decay sequence .",

    "once again it can be observed that the statistical - model calculations are able to reproduce the proton coincidences well , but they fail to describe the @xmath4-cl coincidences and the large yields found in coincidence with p and si er s in the most forward direction .",
    "the reason why the experimental anisotropy factor is not well reproduced by the calculations is not well understood .",
    "the angular momentum dependence has been tested by performing calculations with two different angular - momentum windows : 10 - 20@xmath50 and 20 - 30@xmath50 .",

    "the problem of this discrepancy in the out - of - plane angular correlations may need to use a more complete formulation for the angular distribution of the lp which is treated in a semi - classical way .",
    "the main conclusion that can be drawn from the above analysis indicate that the shape of the @xmath0ca nuclear system is expected to be elongated by rather significant deformation effects during the evaporative processes of @xmath4 particles .",
    "this strong deformation is compatible with the previous analysis of @xmath1si(@xmath2c,2@xmath4)@xmath6s@xmath15 angular correlation data  @xcite .",
    "the extent to which these effects can be reasonably well quantified is dependent on the degree of complexity of the experimental device and , in particular , on the power of the coincidence trigger .",
    "it is of particular interest to note that the value of @xmath80 @xmath12 0.5 found for the quadrupole deformation parameter of @xmath1si + @xmath2c ( see table iii ) might be connected with the recent observation of sd bands in the doubly - magic @xmath0ca nucleus by standard @xmath76-ray spectroscopy methods  @xcite .",
    "correlating large deformations in the hot cn with the presence of sd bands in @xmath0ca is obviously not straightforward , since the deformation deduced from the lcp data is the average , while sd bands are one of the possible configurations .",
    "we made the same discussion with the possible comparison between lcp results for the @xmath1si + @xmath1si reaction  @xcite and @xmath76-ray data displaying very deformed bands in the doubly magic @xmath17ni nucleus  @xcite .",
