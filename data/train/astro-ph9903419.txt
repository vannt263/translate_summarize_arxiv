    "r  coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are a small group of hydrogen - deficient carbon - rich supergiants which undergo spectacular declines ( @xmath0 up to 8 magnitudes ) at irregular intervals apparently tied to their pulsation cycles ( clayton 1996 ) . a cloud of carbon - rich dust forms ; temporarily eclipses the photosphere , revealing a rich `` chromospheric '' emission spectrum ; then disperses , allowing the star to return to maximum light .",
    "the dust is thought to form in patches or puffs , not as a complete shell .",
    "only when the dust condenses in the line of sight will a deep decline occur , although clouds may form during every pulsation cycle somewhere over the surface of the star .",
    "thus , the events are irregular and unpredictable .",
    "extensive ground- and space - based observations of r  crb , ry  sgr and v854  cen have pointed to a unified empirical model of the rcb decline ( see clayton 1996 and references therein ) . a close connection between pulsational phase and the time of dust formation  seen in ry  sgr and v854 cen  implies that condensation occurs near the star ( pugach 1977 ; lawson et al .",
    "1992 , 1999 ) . observed timescales for radiative acceleration of the dust , eclipse of the chromospheric region , and dispersal of the dust add further support to the `` near - star '' model .",
    "there are two major evolutionary models for the origin of rcb stars : the double degenerate and the final helium shell flash ( iben , tutukov , & yungelson 1996 ) .",
    "the former involves the merger of two white dwarfs , and in the latter a white dwarf / evolved planetary nebula ( pn ) central star is blown up to supergiant size by a final helium shell flash . in the final flash model",
    ", there is a close relationship between rcb stars and pn .",
    "the connection between rcb stars and pn has recently become stronger , since the central stars of three old pn ( sakurai s object , v605 aql and fg sge ; duerbeck & bennetti 1996 ; clayton & de marco 1997 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "1998 ; kerber 1998 ; kerber et al .",
    "1999 ) have had observed outbursts that transformed them from hot evolved central stars into cool giants with the spectral and dust formation properties of an rcb star .",
    "this establishes a possible connection between rcb stars , central stars of pn and the final flash scenario . on the other hand",
    ", there is evidence that after the final flash a central star acquires rcb characteristics only for a short time : v605  aql was an rcb star in 1921 , but by 1986 it appeared to have a much hotter spectrum @xmath1 50,000 k ( clayton & de marco 1997 ) . if most final flash stars evolve so rapidly , this scenario for the formation of rcb stars may not be able to yield the number of observed rcb stars .",
    "moreover , the recent claim that white dwarf merging times might not be as long as previously thought , has made the double degenerate scenario a valid and appealing alternative to the final flash scenario for the formation of rcb stars ( iben et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "so the presence or absence of nebulae around rcb stars is of great interest .",
    "an old pn that is no longer ionized could still be seen around a cool rcb star in starlight reflected from dust .",
    "an example of such a reflection nebula is the nebulosity observed around uw cen ( pollacco et al .",
    "this is the only cool rcb star known to have a visible nebula .",
    "however , an extended shell - like structure around r crb has been detected at 100  ( walker 1986 ) .",
    "the lightcurve of uw cen has been provided by the american association of variable star observers ( aavso , mattei 1999 , personal communication ) .",
    "the two observational epochs discussed here occurred during very deep declines of uw cen when the star was @xmath26 mag below maximum ( @xmath39.5 ) .",
    "figure 1a shows the v - band image of uw cen obtained on 1990 may 16/17 with the eso new technology telescope when the star was at v=16.5 .",
    "the description of instrument setup and reduction is contained in pollacco et al .",
    "the image scale is 0.3  pixel@xmath4 and the seeing was @xmath21 .",
    "we have obtained new bvr - band images using the 1 m and 2.5 m telescopes at las campanas observatory . at the 1 m swope telescope",
    ", we used the site#1 , chip ( 2048 x 2048 pixels ) which gave a field of view of almost 24  at a scale of 069/pixel . at the 2.5 m du pont telescope , we employed the tek 5 chip ( 2048 x 2048 pixels ) with 24 @xmath5 m pixels resulting in a scale of 026/pixel . in all observations , two or three exposures of 100 to 600 s duration , depending on the filter used ,",
    "were taken and co - added during reduction .",
    "the intensities in the 1 m telescope images were calibrated using observations of the pg1323 - 086 field which were obtained before and after the uw cen images ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the 2.5 m images were then calibrated using the 1 m data . only the v - band image from the 2.5 m telescope is shown in figure 1b .",
    "it was obtained on 12 february 1998 when uw cen was at v=14.4 and the seeing was better than 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows how different the uw cen nebula appears in images taken just 8 years apart .",
    "the nebula is very tenuous with a maximum surface brightness of @xmath221 - 22 mag/@xmath6 . in 1990 ,",
    "the nebulosity is seen predominantly to the west of the star with clumps to the northeast , east and southwest . in 1998 , there is shell - like nebulosity covering about 45  to the north of the star and very little elsewhere .",
    "the nebula has a diameter of approximately 15  centered on the star . the best estimate of the distance to uw cen is 5.5 kpc ( lawson et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the physical radius of the nebulosity is then about 6 x @xmath7 cm or 0.6 ly . in order for material to flow from the star to the edge of the visible nebula in only 8 years",
    ", an outflow velocity of @xmath224,000 km @xmath8 would be necessary .",
    "such a large velocity has never been seen in an rcb star .",
    "outflow velocities of a few hundred kilometers per second are typically seen in the circumstellar gas during declines ( clayton 1996 ) .",
    "if this is a final flash shell , then 30 - 40 km @xmath8 is a more reasonable velocity ( guerrero & manchado 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the apparent changes seen between 1990 and 1998 were not caused by an actual change in the distribution of dust clouds in the nebula .",
    "the likely explanation is that the dust nebula around uw cen is being illuminated through shifting holes in a changing distribution of newly formed dust near the star .",
    "since both images were obtained during deep declines we can surmise that dust had recently formed around uw cen in both instances .",
    "to investigate this idea , we have produced a simple model of uw cen and its circumstellar dust .",
    "we employed the dirty radiative transfer model ( gordon , witt , & clayton 1999 ) .",
    "this model uses monte carlo techniques to calculate the radiative transfer through arbitrary distributions of dust viewed from any angle .",
    "the inputs to dirty are the stellar distribution , in this case one star , the dust distribution , and the dust grain properties .",
    "we have modeled the dust distribution in the uw cen nebula using two concentric shells .",
    "the model inner shell lies near the star representing the new dust clouds which form during a decline episode .",
    "this shell is optically thick , @xmath9=3 , but contains a number of holes through which starlight shines to illuminate the outer shell .",
    "the model outer shell is a 1  thick homogeneous shell of dust located at a distance of 65 to 75 from the star . in between the two shells",
    ", there is a uniform distribution of dust having a density which is a factor of ten below that of the outer shell .",
    "the optical depth of the nebula not including the inner optically thick shell is small , @xmath100.19 .",
    "the dust albedo and scattering phase function are computed assuming amorphous carbon grains similar to those deduced for v348 sgr ( hecht et al .",
    "the size distribution of the dust grains is a modified gamma function over the interval 0.03 - 0.10 .",
    "the resulting dust albedo in the v - band is 0.025 and the henyey - greenstein scattering phase function asymmetry is 0.14 .",
    "very good fits to the two images were produced by varying the number , size and optical depth of the holes in the inner shell .",
    "our model images are shown in figure  2 .",
    "only a few holes in the inner shell are necessary to fit the observed nebula .",
    "the covering factors of the inner shell in these models are 87% and 89% for the 1990 and 1998 images , respectively .",
    "these numbers include a 5% contribution from photons passing through the @xmath9=3 inner shell .",
    "however , the covering factor of the hemisphere facing away from the line of sight is not strongly constrained in this model .",
    "it is possible to uncover a significant proportion of the back of the star , @xmath220% of the surface area of the whole star , without seeing significant variation in the model images .",
    "the dust behind the star contributes less to the scattered light because of the slight asymmetry in the scattering phase function .",
    "the model used here was chosen for simplicity .",
    "it is not unique .",
    "the observations could also be modeled using a clumpy outer shell and a smaller covering factor for the star .",
    "more images obtained during declines of uw cen are needed to fully map the nebula .",
    "when its true morphology is determined , the uw cen nebula can be compared to the final flash stars . in a30 , for example",
    ", the pn is symmetric while its final flash shell is very clumpy ( guerrero & manchado 1986 ) .",
    "the b - v colors of the uw cen nebula are bluer than the star near the star and then progressively redder toward the outer edge .",
    "these colors are typical of those observed in other reflection nebulae .",
    "our model implies that the total optical depth from the star through the visible nebula is @xmath20.2 . assuming the amorphous carbon grains used for our model , the dust mass is @xmath26 x @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "if we assume a normal interstellar gas - to - dust ratio and solar hydrogen abundance for the nebula , then the total mass is @xmath13 ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) .",
    "uw cen is extremely hydrogen deficient and nothing is known about the abundances in the nebula so this estimate in very uncertain .",
    "comparisons of the direct emission and re - radiation from circumstellar dust in the ir give clues to the covering factor of new dust clouds forming around rcb stars ( clayton 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the flux distribution for uw  cen .",
    "the photometry of uw cen were obtained from jones et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , kilkenny & whittet ( 1984 ) and the iras point source catalog .",
    "the optical and near - ir photometry were obtained when the star was at , or near , maximum light .",
    "these fluxes were dereddened assuming a small optical extinction ( @xmath14 0.2 mag ; lawson et al .",
    "1990 ) and using the typical diffuse interstellar extinction law ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .    the stellar ( optical and near - ir ) flux and dust nebula flux ( mid- and near - ir wavelengths ) were fitted by two planck functions with temperatures of 6000 @xmath15 500 k and 650 @xmath15 50 k , respectively .",
    "planck functions tend to underestimate the @xmath16 of the star by 5001000 k. uw cen is an f - type rcb star like r crb and ry sgr , which has @xmath16 of 7000 @xmath15 500 k ( lawson et al . 1990 ) .",
    "wavelengths longer than 12 @xmath5 m probably show the effect of bright ir cirrus towards uw cen .",
    "the cirrus contribution can be fitted with a 100 k planck function .",
    "the luminosity ratio _",
    "f_@xmath17/_f_@xmath18 was calculated for uw cen , where _ f_@xmath17 is the integrated flux of the planck fit to the ir excess and _",
    "f_@xmath18 is that for the star . for uw cen",
    ", we derive a ratio of _",
    "f_@xmath17/_f_@xmath19 0.3 .",
    "this is comparable to values given for uw cen and other rcb stars based on long - term ir photometry ( feast et al .",
    "they find an apparent upper limit of _",
    "f_@xmath17/_f_@xmath18 @xmath2 0.5 for rcb stars .",
    "since the albedo for carbon dust is so low , this ratio is a measure of the covering factor of the star .",
    "so typically , no more than 50% of the stellar radiation is absorbed by the circumstellar clouds and re - radiated in the ir .",
    "no significant change is measured in the ir flux during an rcb decline indicating that the covering factor does not increase by a large amount during any dust formation episode .",
    "several studies of uv extinction due to the rcb circumstellar dust have estimated the covering factor ( f ) of the dust clouds by fitting the extinction and scattering in the dust .",
    "for the cool rcb stars , r crb and ry sgr , hecht et al .",
    "( 1984 ) find f@xmath200.5 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the visible / ir result and imply an upper limit of f=0.5 for rcb stars",
    ". however , the results of our modeling of the uw cen nebula imply a very high covering factor .",
    "this result is softened by the fact that the model is somewhat insensitive to the value of f on the far side of the star and that there are only data from two declines .",
    "the covering factor undoubtedly varies from decline to decline .",
    "if uw cen is a final flash object then it will be an old pn central star and should be surrounded by the now neutral pn as well as the final flash shell .",
    "seven pn in the galaxy , a30 , v605 aql , a78 , sakurai s object , fg sge , iras 183332357 and iras 151545258 are hydrogen deficient and have central stars which have experienced a final helium shell flash ( e.g. , guerrero & manchado 1996 ; clayton & de marco 1997 , jacoby , de marco & sawyer 1998 ; gonzalez et al . 1998 ) . in each of these objects ,",
    "the old pn surrounds a smaller final flash shell .",
    "predicted time scales indicate that the final flash will happen @xmath29000 - 18000 yr after the first ejection depending on mass ( blcker 1995 , iben et al .",
    "1983 ) and that the star will rejoin the agb a few hundred years after the final flash . if we assume",
    "the star becomes an rcb shortly afterwards ( as indicated by sakurai s object ) , and stays that way for @xmath23000 to 10000  yr ( iben et al . 1996 ) and the dust is expanding at 35 km @xmath8 , then we would expect the old pn for uw cen to have a diameter of 24  to 50 , its final flash shell to have a diameter of 8  to 26  and rcb dust inside that .",
    "these diameters agree well with the measured value of 15  for the uw cen nebula .",
    "since only one nebula has been detected around uw cen , it could be either an old pn or the final flash shell .",
    "alternatively , the nebula could be a wind - blown bubble in the ism . at 20 km @xmath8 , wind - blown dust",
    "could form the observed nebula in 9,500 yr . a link between rcb stars and pn",
    ", if it can be established , will be an important step forward in understanding the evolution of post - agb stars .",
    "more observations are necessary to both map out the nebula of uw cen and to resolve the disagreement between the large dust covering factor predicted by the model and the smaller values inferred from uv and ir data .",
