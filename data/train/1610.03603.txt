    ", we quantitatively identify the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) regime and the quantum critical ( qc ) regime in a two - dimensional bose - hubbard model by comparing numerical results from the _ ab initio _ path - integral quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite with results from the effective theories .",
    "more precisely , we define a proper approach to investigate how the correlation length ( @xmath0 ) and the critical exponent ( @xmath1 ) changes as a function of system parameters near the transition boundaries .",
    "we show that the temperature regime for observing the sf - mi transition can be as high as 10nk and the spatial regime can be large to @xmath2 lattice sites in an experiment of rb atoms in a harmonic trap .",
