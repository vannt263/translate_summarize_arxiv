    "while the desire of building code - cracking quantum computers @xcite remains a long standing goal , its pursuit has pushed forward the enormous progress achieved in quantum mesoscopic physics and quantum nanodevices .",
    "these efforts have already resulted in the development of a new class of mesoscopic devices @xcite and even new types of materials known as quantum metamaterials @xcite .",
    "development of such new devices requires a deep understanding of dynamics of single and multi - qubit systems driven both by ac signals ( e.g. , electromagnetic radiation , or ac voltage and/or currents ) and noise . following this direction of research ,",
    "several quantum amplifiers have been recently proposed for one @xcite and two - qubit @xcite systems .",
    "the idea @xcite was to extend the stochastic resonance phenomenon ( amplification by certain amount of noise ) for one or two ac driven qubits to enhance quantum coherence .",
    "further analogy @xcite between two - qubit system , a brownian particle driven in periodic substrate and a parametric amplifier has resulted in a proposal to use two coupled qubits as an amplifier of quantum oscillations .",
    "this work was motivated by the analogy between driven brownian nanoparticles and a system of coupled qubits .",
    "it is well - known that an overdamped particle driven by two harmonic ac signals through the substrate can drift in any desirable direction if frequencies of the two drives are commensurate .",
    "this effect known as harmonic mixing @xcite has been already observed in many systems , including vortices in superconductors @xcite , nanoparticles driven through a pore @xcite , current driven josephson junctions @xcite etc .",
    "this suggests an idea that a coupled two - qubit system also should exhibit a harmonic mixing behaviour , but in contrast to the usual classical harmonic mixing for overdamped particles , quantum harmonic mixing should be via parametric coupling of two drives in the quantum master equation .",
    "this effect can be used to synchronize quantum oscillations in the two qubits and can control the average probability for a qubit to stay in either ground or excited state by changing the relative phase and/or frequencies of the bi - harmonic drive .",
    "further , our results can be applied to the case when one needs to control qubits , which do not have their own control circuitry for the reasons of limiting the decoherence brought in by such extra elements , or because of accessibility ( e.g. , in case of 2d or 3d qubit arrays @xcite with control circuitry placed at the boundary viz . surface of the device ) .",
    "similar problems arise in the so - called indirect quantum tomography ( see e.g. , ref . ) or in quantum computations with access to a limited number of qubits ( see e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "in all these cases , the proposed method of harmonic mixing in qubits allows to control the state of the second ( not directly accessible qubit ) by varying the frequency and/or phase of the first ( accessible ) qubit .",
    "in order to describe a two - qubit system we will use a hamiltonian in a spin - representation for each qubit with the so called @xmath0 coupling : @xmath1 + g\\ ; \\sigma^1_x\\ : \\sigma^2_x \\label{eq - ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are pauli matrices corresponding to either the first ( @xmath4 ) or the second ( @xmath5 ) qubit .",
    "the tunnelling splitting energies @xmath6 are usually determined by the geometry and fabrication details of the specific device , while the bias energies @xmath7 can be driven externally . for simplicity , we consider two identical qubits ; that is , we assume @xmath8 . let us drive the qubits by a controlled bi - harmonic drive : @xmath9 in other words , each qubit is driven by its own signal and amplitudes , frequencies and relative phase of these two signal can be varied at will . the question arises if and under what conditions the second qubit can influence the coherence and occupation of the ground and excited states of the first one .",
    "therefore , we are interested if the second qubit can be used to control the state of the first qubit via dynamic synchronization of their quantum oscillations .",
    "( a ) and @xmath10 ( b ) for two coupled qubits driven by the two harmonic drives ( [ drive1 ] ) with parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the averaging time interval @xmath14 ( thus , averaging time @xmath15 was @xmath16 ) .",
    "other parameters are the simulation step @xmath17 , the number of simulation steps @xmath18 , damping @xmath19 , coupling constant @xmath20 , the tunneling splitting energies @xmath21 . to veryfy our numerical results we simulate by using both euler ( open circles ) and second - order multidirivative methods ( filled circles ) . the time - averaged bloch tensor element @xmath22 responsible for the qubit coherence shows peaks at @xmath23 , while the time averaged component @xmath24 peaks at @xmath25 .",
    "also , pumping of the excited state for incommensurate frequencies is clearly seen : @xmath26 increases for @xmath27 . by simulating the ten times denser point mesh for frequency ratios from 0.01 to 1 ( see inset in ( a ) ) we have obtained extra commensurate resonance frequency ratios but still could not resolve width resonances , which is consistent ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) with zero - width harmonic mixing resonances in classical nonlinear devices , where the response near resonances behave as @xmath28 , where @xmath15 is the observation time , and @xmath29 is detuning . in order to check whether we have a similar behaviour for qubit harmonic mixing",
    ", we have simulated @xmath24 and @xmath22 ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) near resonances @xmath30 and 2 with frequency detuning @xmath31 and observed finite resonance width and oscillations near resonances similar to classical harmonic mixing .",
    ", width=302 ]    the two - qubit density matrix @xmath32 can be written as @xmath33 this is a straightforward generalization of the standard representation of the single - qubit density matrix expression using the bloch vector ; the components @xmath34 thus constitute what can be called the bloch tensor .",
    "then , the master equation , @xmath35+\\hat{\\gamma}\\hat{\\rho } , \\label{poxyj}\\ ] ] can be written down directly , using the standard approximation for the dissipation operator @xmath36 via the dephasing @xmath37 , and relaxation @xmath38 rates , to characterize the intrinsic noise in the system . the master equation ( [ master ] )",
    "can be explicitly written as follows @xcite : @xmath39 also , for simplicity , hereafter we assume that the relaxation rates are the same for both identical qubits , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the temperature is low enough , resulting in @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the equilibrium value of the @xmath44-component of the bloch vector .",
    "this set of ordinary differential equations is an ideal starting point for numerical analysis of the dynamics of two driven and dissipative qubits as it has been proved before @xcite .",
    "we will simulate these differential equations for two differently driven qubits and will study quantum harmonic mixing .    in the limit of zero coupling , @xmath45",
    ", there exists a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ poxy ] ) with no entanglement between the qubits .",
    "this solution can be written as a direct product of two independent density matrices expressed through their bloch vectors : @xmath46 the components of the bloch tensor @xmath34 are all zero with the exception of @xmath47 which are just the separate qubits bloch vector components .",
    "the density matrix components @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 can be often directly accessible in experiments .",
    "for instance , for two coupled flux qubits the circulating currents in each qubit are proportional to @xmath54 or @xmath55 , respectively ( see e.g. , ref . ) , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 determine the occupation probabilities of the upper ( lower ) level for the first and the second qubit : @xmath58 with @xmath4 or 2 .",
    "we simulated the set ( [ poxy ] ) by using the standard euler method which has been proved to converge well for low - noise drives @xcite and analyzed the time - averaged diagonal element of density matrix @xmath59 , responsible for the mean coherence in the first qubit , as well as the time - averaged density matrix element @xmath60 , responsible for the mean occupation of the ground and excited states in the first qubit .",
    "to verify validity of our numerical results we have also used higher - order multiderivative methods to prove the stability of our numerical procedure ( compare the open circles for euler methods and the filled circles for the second order method in fig . 1 and 2 ) .     for two coupled qubits driven by the two harmonic drives ( eq.([drive1 ] ) ) with the same parameters as in fig .",

    ", width=302 ]     and @xmath24 on the relative phase of two drives of the bi - harmonic signal at different frequency ratio @xmath63 ( a ) , 3(b ) , 4(c ) .",
    "all other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "1 . for even frequency ratio , where @xmath22 has a peak ( fig.1 ) ,",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath64 and a week dependence of @xmath65 occurs , while , for odd ratio of @xmath66 , dependence of @xmath65 is clearly seen and @xmath64 is negligible .",
    "the periods of functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 are controlled by the frequency ratio and are equal to @xmath67 ( for @xmath68 ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    as we expected , there is no mean coherence @xmath69 for most of frequency ratio @xmath70 apart from the specific commensurate cases ( e.g. , @xmath71 , see fig.1a ) .",
    "such a situation reminds of a usual classical harmonic mixing for nanoparticles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , however , the frequency ratios where peaks occur , are also tuneable by changing the absolute value of signal frequency in either the first or the second qubit . indeed , choosing the frequency @xmath72 to be equal to the inter - level spacing frequency @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "1a ) or @xmath13 ( fig.2a ) or even away from the inter - level resonances @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "2b ) results in a qualitatively similar peak structure , but showing different sequence of the frequency ratios .",
    "indeed , for @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "2b ) , several new frequency ratios corresponding to the enhancement of qubit coherence occur at @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , some peaks can even change their signs ( compare peaks at @xmath75 in fig .",
    "1a , 2a , 2b ) indicating that both the frequency ratio and the absolute value of frequency can be used to tune qubit harmonic mixing .",
    "such a behaviour is quite unusual with respect to classical harmonic mixing ( see e.g. , @xcite ) where the frequency ratio is defined by nonlinearity of the system .",
    "in contrast , the master equation set ( [ poxy ] ) is linear and harmonic mixing occurs via a mixture of multiplicative drives as in the qubit parametric oscillator . as we have recently shown , this results in a quite unusual spectra of @xmath76 , and in particular @xmath54 and @xmath56 with many harmonic peaks showing complex hierarchy .",
    "this can explain a non - trivial behaviour of harmonic mixing changes when varying @xmath72 or @xmath77 .",
    "note also , that the quantum harmonic mixing occurs in both cases : when ( i ) @xmath72 is equal to inter - level spacing and ( ii ) away from this situation .",
    "therefore , there is no need to tune the parameters of the external drives to any characteristic internal frequency of the two qubit system to observe quantum harmonic mixing .",
    "we have also observed a similar harmonic mixing in time - averaged matrix element @xmath24 responsible for the occupation of the excited and ground states ( fig .",
    "interestingly , the peaks in @xmath24 occur at different ratios of bi - harmonic drive @xmath78 .",
    "however , such a behaviour is perfectly consistent with the harmonic spectra of @xmath24 and @xmath22 studied in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the specrum of @xmath54 contains only odd harmonics , while the spectrum of @xmath56 consist of even harmonics in agreement with the fact that peaks of @xmath22 and @xmath24 have a different parity .",
    "moreover , apart from the peaks at the specific commensurate frequencies , the value of @xmath26 gradually increases with the frequency for @xmath27 indicating pumping in the excited state even for incommensurate frequencies .    following the analogy with classical harmonic mixing @xcite",
    ", we expect the dependence of @xmath22 and @xmath24 on the relative phase @xmath79 of bi - harmonic drive at commensurate frequencies where peaks have been observed .",
    "indeed , we obtained such a dependence @xmath64 and @xmath65 shown in fig .",
    "3(a - c ) for the same simulation parameters as in fig . 1 and for frequency ratios @xmath63 ( a ) , 3 ( b ) , 4 ( c ) .",
    "the well resolved peaks of @xmath22 at even frequency ratios @xmath63 and 4 exhibit a strong dependence on relative phase , while very weak peaks of @xmath24 at these frequency ratios show almost no dependence on @xmath79 . comparing figures 3(a ) and 3(c )",
    ", we also conclude that periodicity of the @xmath64 changes with increasing frequency ratio following the rule : @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the number of full oscillations increases with frequency ratio @xmath66 .",
    "this dependence of the @xmath79-periods of @xmath22 and @xmath24 oscillations on the frequency ratio of the harmonic drives is analogous to the similar dependence of classical harmonic mixing of a brownian particle driven by bi - harmonic drive on nonlinear substrate @xcite .",
    "we have predicted quantum harmonic mixing in a two - qubit system driven by a bi - harmonic drive .",
    "it manifests itself in a set of peaks of time - averaged density matrix components responsible for both qubit coherence and occupation of ground and excited states of the qubits .",
    "these peaks can be controlled not only by the ratio of frequencies of the two signals but also by tuning frequencies themselves and by relative phase of the two signals .",
    "such a quantum harmonic mixing can be used to manipulate one driven qubit by applying an additional ac signal to the other qubit coupled with the one we have to control . indeed , setting the frequency of the second qubit to be three times larger than the one of the first qubit and changing the relative phase of signals in these qubits produces oscillations of the density matrix element @xmath56 with amplitude of about 0.1 according to fig . 3b .",
    "therefore , by changing the driving signal only in the second qubit should allow us to indirectly vary the occupation probabilities of the upper level in the first qubit between 47 and 58 percent ( see eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) ) .",
    "a stronger coupling between the qubits should allow an even larger amplitude of the indirect control of the occupation probability .",
    "this effect is obviously robust to a reasonably strong decoherence and energy dissipation in the system .",
