    "since @xmath7 is only assumed to be continuous , the full range of porous medium nonlinearities is included : @xmath20 for @xmath21 . in particular , also the fast diffusion range . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath7 is only assumed to be nondecreasing , it can be constant on sets of positive measure and then equation is strongly degenerate .",

    "the uniqueness result is hard to prove because of our very general assumptions on the initial value problem combined with a very weak solution concept  merely bounded distributional solutions .",

    "e.g. @xcite for the local case ) , or equivalently , additional regularity in time as in @xcite ( see the uniqueness result for so - called strong solutions ) .",
    "finally , since our solutions are not assumed to have finite energy , the classical uniqueness argument of oleinik @xcite can not be adapted either . for this type of results ,",

    "their argument is quite indirect and rely on a clever idea using resolvents and their integral representations ( fundamental solutions ) . in this paper , we adapt such an approach to our nonlocal setting .",
    "but because of the generality of our diffusion operators , we can not rely on explicit fundamental solutions for our proofs . in stead , we have to develop this part of the theory from scratch , using the equation and the regularity that comes with our solutions concept to obtain the necessary estimates .",
    "to do this , a key tool is to approximate the possibly singular integral operator @xmath8 by a bounded integral operator and then carefully pass to the limit .",
    "this proceedure , and hence also the proof , is truly nonlocal ",
    "there is no similar approximation by local operators .",

    "the techniques are different from ours , and the assumptions imposed are stronger ( less general ) : the ( singular part of ) @xmath8 and the fractional laplacian must be comparable , and for uniquness , the initial data is assumed to belong to @xmath39",

    "because of this , at least the well - posedness is easier to handle in this case .",
    "there are other ways to generalize the porous medium equation to a nonlocal setting . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider a so - called porous medium equations with fractional pressure .",
    "these equations are in a divergence form , and no uniqueness is known except when @xmath40 . finally , we mention that in the presence of ( nonlinear ) convection , additional entropy conditions are needed to have uniqueness as in the local case .",
    "nonuniqueness of distributional solutions is proved in @xcite , and several well - posedness results for entropy solutions are given in @xcite .",
