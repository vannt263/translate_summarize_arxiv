    "classical wormholes are usually considered as euclidean metrics that consist of two asymptotically flat regions connected by a narrow throat ( handle ) .",
    "wormholes have been studied mainly as instantons , namely solutions of the classical euclidean field equations . in general",
    ", such wormholes can represent quantum tunneling between different topologies .",
    "they are possibly useful in understanding black hole evaporation @xcite ; in allowing nonlocal connections that could determine fundamental constants ; and in vanishing the cosmological constant @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "they are even considered as an alternative to the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "consequently , such solutions are worth finding .",
    "unfortunately , they exist for certain special kinds of matter @xcite .",
    "for example , they exist for an imaginary minimally coupled scalar field @xcite , but do not exist for pure gravity . due to",
    "limited known classical wormhole solutions , hawking and page advocated a different approach in which wormholes were regarded , not as solutions of the classical euclidean field equations , but as solutions of the quantum mechanical wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "these wave functions have to obey certain boundary conditions in order that they represent wormholes .",
    "the boundary conditions seem to be that : ( i ) the wave function is exponentially damped for large tree geometries ; ( ii ) the wave function is regular in some suitable way when the tree - geometry collapses to zero .    the first condition express the fact that spacetime should be euclidean when tree geometries become infinite .",
    "the second condition should reflect the fact that spacetime is nonsingular when tree geometries degenerates , namely the wave function should not oscillate an infinite number of time .",
    "therefore , in general , an open and interesting problem is whether classical and quantum wormholes can occur for fairly general matter sources . to the author s knowledge ,",
    "the dark energy as a @xmath0-decaying source has not been received much attention , in this regard .",
    "although there are few works attempting to study such a universe ( in a different formulation ) , using quantum effective action @xcite , we shall consider this model and seek for the classical and quantum wormhole solutions , explicitly .",
    "the reason why classical wormholes may exist is related to the implication of a theorem of cheeger and glommol @xcite which states that a _ necessary _",
    "condition for a wormhole to exist is that the eigenvalues of the ricci tensor be negative _ somewhere _ on the manifold .",
    "this is necessary but not _ sufficient _ condition for their existence .",
    "for example , the energy - momentum tensors of an axion field and of a conformal scalar field are such that , when coupled to gravity , the ricci tensor has negative eigenvalues .",
    "however , for a minimally coupled scalar field with the lagrangian density @xmath1 and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 the einstein equations read @xmath3 which shows @xmath4 can never be negative .    taking this into account , we consider an euclidean friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric @xmath5 , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the scale factor and @xmath7 and @xmath8 account for flat , closed and open universes , respectively . this metric evolves according to the einstein equation . ]",
    "@xmath9 where we take the energy momentum tensor @xmath10 to be perfect fluid @xmath11 the time - time and space - space components of the einstein equation ( [ 2 ] ) leads respectively to @xmath12 @xmath13 where eq.([4 ] ) is the euclidean friedmann equation in which the derivative is with respect to the euclidean time .",
    "there is also a conservation equation @xmath14 whose time component gives the fluid equation @xmath15 wormholes are typically described by the euclidean friedmann equation ( [ 4 ] ) with a scale factor dependent density , typically as @xmath16 .",
    "we now assume a _ flat _",
    "frw universe with a perfect fluid source combined of ordinary matter and a source evolving with the scale factor @xmath17 the first term is the ordinary matter density and the second term is a density playing the role of ( negative ) dark energy - a decaying cosmological term . in fact , there are theoretical and observational motivations for considering models in which @xmath0 decays .",
    "for example , such behaviors as @xmath18 @xcite or @xmath19 @xcite have already been reported . for @xmath20 @xcite ,",
    "the effect of decaying cosmological term on the cosmic microwave background anisotropy is studied and the angular power spectrum for different values of @xmath21 and density parameter @xmath22 is computed .",
    "models with @xmath23 and @xmath24 are shown to be in good agreement with data . for @xmath25 @xcite",
    ", it is shown that in the early universe @xmath0 could be several tens of orders bigger than its present value , but not big enough disturbing the physics in the radiation - dominant epoch in the standard cosmology . in the matter - dominant epoch",
    "such a varying @xmath0 shifts the three space curvature parameter @xmath26 by a constant which changes the standard cosmology predictions reconciling observations with the inflationary scenario .",
    "such a vanishing cosmological term also leads to present creation of matter with a rate comparable to that in the steady - state cosmology @xcite .    to obtain the necessary condition for the existence of wormholes we evaluate the eigenvalues of the ricci tensor @xmath27 which together with the perfect fluid ( [ 3 ] ) and the equation of state ( [ 13 ] ) ( see below ) leads , for example , to @xmath28-\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{\\lambda_0}{a^2}. \\label{12}\\ ] ] it is seen that @xmath29 can be negative at large @xmath30 for any @xmath31",
    "however , it does not guarantee that wormholes certainly do exist for this range of @xmath32 .",
    "it is therefore , necessary to check out the _ sufficient _ condition .",
    "substitution for @xmath33 from ( [ 10 ] ) and @xmath34 into eq.([4 ] ) leads to . ]",
    "@xmath35 in order to have an asymptotically euclidean wormhole @xmath36 must remains positive at large @xmath30 .",
    "this wormhole then represents two separate asymptotically euclidean regions joined together by a throat with the finite size @xmath37 at which @xmath38 . since according to _ strong energy condition",
    "@xmath39 , then we can not have this wormhole for @xmath40 because @xmath36 becomes negative . therefore",
    ", classical euclidean wormholes are possible for @xmath41 , namely if the dark energy has a negative energy density @xmath42 . on the other hand , even for @xmath41 we need @xmath43 to have a positive @xmath36 at large @xmath30 .    to determine the equation of state , we substitute for @xmath33 from eq.([10 ] ) in the conservation equation ( [ 7 ] ) and obtain the following equation of state @xmath44 @xmath45 where the first term describes the standard equation of state for ordinary matter and the second term accounts for equation of state for the dark energy .    in conclusion , considering the _ necessary _ and _ sufficient _ conditions as @xmath43 , one finds that classical euclidean wormholes are possible for the matter source ( [ 10 ] ) if and only if @xmath46 , provided the dark energy has a negative energy density . in the lorentzian sector of the model",
    ", it is easy to show that @xmath47 leads the strong energy condition to hold for the total pressure @xmath48 and total density @xmath33 .",
    "as a matter of fact , the number of known classical wormholes is so limited .",
    "it casts doubt on whether wormholes are important , only in the very restricted class of theories , in which the matter content allows wormhole instantons ? to resolve this problem , hawking and page advocated a different approach and considered that solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation could more generally represent the wormholes @xcite .",
    "they realized that for the mini superspace models one may consider metrics of the euclidean friedmann form @xmath49 if @xmath50 is imaginary , this is the lorentzian metric , and if @xmath50 is real , it is the metric of an euclidean wormhole .",
    "however , solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation are independent of the lapse function @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "so , they can be interpreted either as friedmann universe , or as wormholes according to the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions for wormholes seems to be that the wave functions should decay exponentially for large scale factor @xmath30 , so as to represent euclidean space , and that they be regular in some suitable way as @xmath52 , so that no singularities are present .    by defining @xmath53",
    "we obtain the rescaled friedmann equation @xmath54 with the constant @xmath55 the quantum mechanical version of this equation is given by @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 represents part of the factor ordering ambiguities .",
    "we set @xmath58 and study the potential to get some idea as to when a euclidean domain occurs at large @xmath59 by considering the sign of the potential @xmath60 in the equation @xmath61\\psi(r)=0 . \\label{15}\\ ] ] for positive potential @xmath62 , oscillating solutions occur which represent lotentzian metrics . on the contrary , for negative potential @xmath63 , wormhole solutions can occur which are asymptotically euclidean at large @xmath59 .",
    "the potential is negative for @xmath31 in the case of positive energy density @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , wormholes obeying the hawking - page boundary condition at large @xmath59 , occur when @xmath31 is valid for the source ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the presence of any matter source with @xmath65 will eventually dominate for large @xmath59 and prevent the asymptotically euclidean wormholes to occur .",
    "asymptotically euclidean property of the wave function is not sufficient to make it a wormhole .",
    "it also requires regularity for small @xmath59 . in order to realize this",
    ", we can ignore @xmath66 term in eq.([14 ] ) as @xmath67 , when @xmath31 . in this case , the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 14 ] ) ( for @xmath68 ) simplifies to a bessel differential equation with solution @xmath69 , \\label{16}\\ ] ] where use has been made of @xmath70 .",
    "the wormhole boundary condition at @xmath67 is satisfied for the bessel function of the @xmath71 kind .    in the particular case @xmath72 , the solution of eq.([14 ] ) with @xmath73",
    "is a linear combination of bessel functions @xmath74 which oscillates an infinite number of times at @xmath67 and therefore can not satisfy the required regularity condition for a quantum wormhole .    on the other hand , in the case of @xmath75 which represents radiation ( or equivalently , that of a conformally coupled scalar field ) dominated frw ansatz , eq.([14 ] ) for @xmath58 is written as @xmath76 which is in the form of a parabolic equation with solution in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions @xcite @xmath77.\\ \\label{18}\\ ] ] for example , for @xmath78 with @xmath79 , and @xmath80 with @xmath81 , we obtain regular oscillations at @xmath82 , and euclidean regimes for large @xmath59 , see figs.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .",
    "therefore , hawking - page boundary conditions are satisfied for some special values of @xmath83 and so we have a spectrum of wormholes . considering eq.([12 ] ) , it turns out that for a given equation of state with @xmath31 , the existence of quantum wormholes depends on the special values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in other words ,",
    "the spectrum of wormholes depends on the spectrum of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we notice that there is no such constraint on these values for the occurrence of classical wormholes .",
    "the classical and quantum wormhole solutions have been studied for a flat euclidean friedmann - robertson - walker metric coupled to a perfect fluid combined of an ordinary matter source and a source playing the role of dark energy ( a decaying cosmological term ) .",
    "we have shown that classical and quantum wormholes exist for this matter source for which the strong energy condition could be hold in the lorentzian sector of the model .",
    "an spectrum of quantum wormholes has been obtained , for each of which there is a specific relation ( [ 12 ] ) between the characteristics of matter and dark energy densities .",
