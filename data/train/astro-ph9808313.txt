    "the energy source of a class of powerful far - infrared galaxies ( firgs ) , which emit the bulk of their bolometric luminosity in the far - ir domain ( soifer et al 1984 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 and references therein ) , is still a major issue under debate .",
    "the large luminosity ( @xmath8 ) of the ir emission , which is likely due to dust reradiation , is comparable with that of qsos .",
    "the far - ir energy distribution of the prototype firgs , ngc6240 , mrk273 and arp220 , is similar to starburst galaxies like m82 , unlike the ` warm ' iras colour ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) typical of seyfert galaxies and qsos ( degrijp et al 1992 ) .",
    "the optical spectra of the nuclear regions of firgs resemble liner or seyfert 2s ( sanders et al 1988 ) , but they appear to be weak in x - ray . a search for x - ray sources associated with powerful firgs in the heao-1 a1 all sky survey data failed to detect any ( rieke 1988 ) .",
    "no detectable hard x - rays in the 50700 kev band for arp220 , mrk273 and mrk231 with the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro)osse ( dermer et al 1997 ) rules out luminous compton - thin x - ray sources ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "no detection of strong hard x - ray emission means that x - rays from a central source are attenuated by a heavy obscuration , if agns power firgs .    on the other hand",
    ", various observations suggest that starburts play a significant role .",
    "direct evidence for a massive star population has been provided by the detection of near - ir co bandhead absorption at 2.3 , which is produced in the stellar atmospheres of red giants and supergiants ( rieke et al 1980 , 1985 ; walker lebofsky & rieke 1988 ; lester et al 1990 ; doyon et al 1994 ; ridgway , wynn - williams & becklin et al 1994 ) .    a large ( tens kpc scale ) extended optical emission - line nebula",
    "is often found around firgs ( heckman , armus & miley 1987 ; armus , heckman & miley 1990 ) .",
    "studies of the gas kinematics in the nebulae ( e.g. , split line - profiles ) have revealed galactic - scale outflow ( ` superwind ' , heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) with velocities of a few hundreds1000 .",
    "a collection of supernovae ( sne ) and stellar winds from massive stars in a nuclear starburst can drive this outflow .",
    "the liner - type excitation of the nebular emission - line gas is consistent with shock - heating by the superwind , which is also expected to produce soft x - rays ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ; tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ) .",
    "some firgs show extended soft x - ray emission observed with einstein observatory and rosat ( fabbiano 1988 ; strickland , ponman & stevens 1997 ; heckman et al 1996 ; dahlem et al 1997 ; schulz et al 1998 ; komossa , schulz & greiner 1998 ) . since this process of generating x - rays",
    "is thought to be not very efficient ( log(@xmath11 ) , the x - ray quiet nature of firgs would not be surprising .",
    "the weak reddening - corrected luminosity ( and small equivalent width ) of br@xmath12 and br@xmath13 in some firgs ( e.g. , arp220 ) have raised the ` ionization photon deficit ' problem with a starburst model : ionizing photons predicted from the bolometric luminosity significantly overproduce the near - ir lines observed ( depoy , becklin & geballe 1987 ; goldader et al 1995 ; armus et al 1995 ; leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "although this has sometimes been claimed as evidence against a starburst model , it essentially means that the major energy source ( whether starburst or agn ) is heavily obscured in dust even in the near - ir band .",
    "the mid - ir line spectroscopy of powerful firgs with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) found such a large extinction ( @xmath144050 ) for starburst regions ( lutz et al 1996 ; strum et al 1996 ; genzel et al 1998 ) , and therefore they favour young starbursts as the primary energy source in firgs .    however , the existence of an even more deeply buried agn is still viable .",
    "the intensive starburst in the outer part of an obscuring region may mask agn acitivity .",
    "the nearby firg , ngc4945 , for which the mid - ir properties are starburst - like , harbours a variable x - ray source absorbed by @xmath15  ( iwasawa et al 1993 ; done , madejski & smith 1996 ) , implying a heavily obscured seyfert nucleus .",
    "the asca data on the prototype powerful firg , ngc6240 , suggests the presence of a qso nucleus deeply buried in obscuration ( mitsuda 1995 ; kii et al 1997 ; iwasawa & comastri 1998 and see below ) .",
    "high sensitivity observations in hard x - ray band provides a unique probe to such heavily obscured agns .",
    "the upper - limits of hard x - ray emission for powerful firgs obtained from previous observations ( rieke 1988 ; eales & arnoud 1988 ; dermer et al 1997 ) are still consistent with the hypothesis that the firgs contains compton - thick sources like ngc1068 : this classical seyfert 2 galaxy is believed to harbour a powerful seyfert 1 nucleus behind an obscuring torus ( e.g. , antonucci & miller 1985 ; miller , goodrich & mathews 1991 ) .",
    "the observed hard x - rays are only due to weak reflected light of the central source , whose direct radiation is completely blocked by an extremely thick absorber ( @xmath16 , koyama et al 1989 ; matt et al 1997 ) in the line of sight .",
    "it should be noted that the hard x - ray flux level is three orders of magnitude below the far - ir emission , which implies the detection limits of heao-1 and osse are insufficient for distant firgs .",
    "this classic example makes a sensitive x - ray survey of the firgs searching for agns still worthwhile .",
    "the compton - thick situation can be more likely in firgs than normal seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the large amount of molecular gas concentrated in the central region ( sub - kilo parsec in size ) of powerful firgs ( sanders , scoville & soifer 1991 ; scoville et al 1991 ; solomon , downes & radford 1992 ) and its high density ( @xmath17 , solomon et al 1992 ; bryant & scoville 1996 ; scoville , yun & bryant 1997 ) would easily make up a large column density ( e.g. , @xmath18 ) to suppress the direct x - ray radiation from a central source .",
    "even reflected light would be difficult to detect in the soft x - ray band as observed with rosat , since moderate absorption ( @xmath19 ) would be expected because of the high extinction for the nuclear regions , and it suppresses the soft x - ray light .",
    "therefore x - ray observations above @xmath142 kev are important to observe agn free from absorption .",
    "the reflection - dominated x - ray spectrum is characterized by a flat hard x - ray continuum and a strong iron k line at 6.4 kev , as seen in ngc1068 ( marshall et al 1993 ; ueno et al 1994 ; iwasawa , fabian & matt 1997 ) .",
    "therefore x - ray spectra are also important to assess the origin of observed x - ray emission .    using good spectral resolution and high sensitivity to x - rays above 2 kev , where agn emission would dominate ,",
    "we study four prototype powerful firgs , mrk231 , mrk273 , arp220 and ngc6240 .",
    "we discuss the implications on starbursts and agns from the x - ray data , and the primary energy sources of the firgs .",
    "we present results on four prototype powerful firgs : arp220 , ngc6240 , mrk231 and mrk273 ( table 1 ) .",
    "they are all among the infrared colour - selected sample ( icss ) galaxies ( armus , heckman & miley 1990 ) and lie in a well - defined part of iras colour - colour diagram ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) which is distinctive from where other class of objects occur : their ` tepid ' characteristic temperatures are different from that of normal galaxies or seyferts / qso .",
    "the four galaxies are good representative of the particular class of objects in terms of large ir luminosity ( @xmath22 ) , characteristic far - ir spectrum , distorted host galaxy , and concentrated large molecular gas content ( @xmath23 , sanders , scoville & soifer 1991 ; scoville et al 1991 ) .",
    "a double nucleus is found in all galaxies except mrk231 .",
    "the optical spectra of their nuclear regions are considerably red and the emission - line properties are classified as liner ( ngc6240 ) seyfert-2 ( mrk273 and arp220 ) and seyfert-1 ( mrk231 ) .",
    "kinematic signatures of galactic - scale outflow ( e.g. , split line profiles , heckman et al 1990 ; hamilton & keel 1987 ) have been found in the circumnuclear regions , and large extended h@xmath12 nebulae ( tens kpc ) were imaged for all the galaxies by armus et al ( 1990 ) .",
    "weak soft x - ray emission has been detected from all the galaxies with einstein observatory and rosat .",
    "no detection of x - rays above @xmath143 kev has been reported for them before the asca observations .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        based on the spectral analysis of the asca data , we assume that the observed soft x - ray emission below 2 kev is predominantly thermal emission originating from a starburst in those galaxies . then we compare the soft x - ray luminosities with the other possible indicators of a starburst .",
    "we note that it is premature to claim any correlation from these comparisons because of the small size of the sample , and the trends seen here must be tested by a larger sample .",
    "far - ir luminosity is generally thought to be a good indicator of starburst intensity .",
    "however , arp220 is far more powerful in the far - ir , relative to other bands , e.g. , the soft x - ray emission ( fig .",
    "9 ) , h@xmath6 , optical light ( @xmath24 , see table 1 ) , than the other firgs .",
    "the far - ir excess in arp220 is discussed in section 6.3    conceivably , starburst - driven galactic outflow is a main heating source of the extended optical emission - line nebulae ( heckman et al 1990 ) .",
    "armus et al ( 1990 ) show that more than half of the total h@xmath6+[nii ] luminosity ( not corrected for internal reddening ) comes from outside the central @xmath25 kpc box and the sizes of the nebulae are a few tens kpc in the firgs apart from mrk231 , in which the broad h@xmath6 line observed in the nucleus dominates the total luminosity .",
    "shock heating of the ism by the outflow is also a likely source of the soft x - ray emission , as supported by the soft x - ray morphology aligned with a superwind structure in nearby starburst galaxies like m82 ( e.g. , fabbiano 1988 ; strickland et al 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , the luminosity ratio of the h@xmath6+[nii ] and soft x - ray ( 0.52 kev ) of the firgs are similar to each other ( 2.65.5 ; fig .",
    "10 ) while m82 has a larger value ( @xmath26 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", a starburst stellar population appears to account for the near - ir emission in the firgs except for mrk231 ( ridgway et al 1994 ; shier et al 1996 ) .",
    "a correlation between the 2.2  and the soft x - ray luminosity is relatively good ( fig .",
    "the excess of the 2.2  emission in mrk231 is probably due to a contribution from the agn , as suggested from the near - ir properties ( fig .",
    "12 ; blue @xmath27 colour and the very shallow co absorption feature at 2.3 ) .",
    "it should be noted that optical depths at 2.2  and the soft x - ray band are similar to each other if the standard gas - to - dust ratio is assumed .    in summary ,",
    "the soft x - ray emission , extended optical emission - line nebulae , and near - ir emission are consistent with each other in the context of starburst , but not with the far - ir emission .      at the low quality of the present data ,",
    "a single temperature model is a sufficient description for the starburst soft x - ray emission .",
    "however , some good quality data like of m82 ( tsuru et al 1997 ; strickland et al 1997 ) and ngc6240 ( iwasawa & comastri 1998 ) have provided evidence for multi - temperature gas and absorption for the starburst regions . obscured , hot gas in the near - nuclear region and cooler gas at larger radii are expected from the superwind scenario ( chevarier & clegg 1985 ; tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ) .",
    "high obscuration in starbust nuclei have also been inferred from optical and infrared observations of starburst ( e.g. , m82 , heckman et al 1990 ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( roche et al 1983 ; thronson et al 1990 ; lutz et al 1996 ; dudley & wynn - williams 1997 ) .",
    "the size of the starburst region in far - ir galaxies appears to be compact ( dense molecular disk in mrk231 and arp220 are inferred to be few hundreds pc in radius , bryant & scoville 1996 ; scoville et al 1997 ) .",
    "a compact starburst near the nucleus has also been found in some seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , mrk477 , heckman et al 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , the starburst ring in ngc1068 is on rather large scale ( few kpc ) and well separated from the seyfert 2 nucleus ( neff et al 1994 ) .",
    "the compact starburst regions are likely to be more obscured than the large scale starburst region in ngc1068 .",
    "the much softer spectrum of ngc1068 in the low energy x - ray band than the other firgs ( fig .",
    "8) is therefore suspected to be due to the difference of obscuration .",
    "the correction for absorption would be important for estimating the true starburt luminosity through x - ray data .",
    "high quality data from future observations are required to decompose the gas structure .",
    "the absorption - corrected 210 kev luminosity of mrk273 is only @xmath28 , nearly three orders of magnitude below the far - ir luminosity .",
    "this suggests that mrk273 contains an obscured agn which is not a qso nucleus which would provide the bulk of the bolometric luminosity , but a moderate - luminosity seyfert .",
    "however , note that since a reflection - dominated spectrum is not ruled out by the present data ( see section 4.2.2 ) , the intrinsic luminosity of the hidden agn could be as high as qsos .",
    "the heavily obscured x - ray nucleus in the nearby seyfert 2 galaxy ngc4945 has the 210 kev luminosity of @xmath29  after correction for absorption .",
    "it is also three orders of magnitude below the far - ir luminosity . in these cases ,",
    "the obscured agn do not play a major role in powering the far - ir emission and starbursts are probably the most important energy source .",
    "in fact , the mid - ir properties of ngc4945 are in excellent agreement with those of the other starburst galaxies ( genzel et al 1998 ) .",
    "the lack of agn features in the mid - ir band can easily be understood , considering the extremely thick obscuration of the central source in ngc4945 implied from x - ray observations ( @xmath30 , or @xmath31 , iwasawa et al 1993 ; done et al 1996 ) .",
    "the detection of high excitation mid - ir lines , e.g. , [ oiv ] 26 , [ nev ] 14.3,24.3 , in mrk273 from the iso / sws ( genzel et al 1998 ) is probably due to the smaller obscuration of the central source ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "alternatively , perhaps the x - ray source has now faded to its low state , leaving the large ew ( @xmath34 ev ) of the fe k line from a distant line emitter as a reverberation effect ( e.g. , mrk3 , iwasawa et al 1994 ; ngc2992 , weaver et al 1996 ) .",
    "ngc6240 is suspected of harbouring a qso nucleus , possibly emitting at @xmath35 .",
    "the estimated qso luminosity , almost comparable with the far - ir luminosity , suggests that the hidden qso makes a significant contribution to the far - ir ( bolometric ) luminosity and may even dominate it .",
    "the galaxy is the most powerful soft x - ray emitter among the four firgs presented here , indicating that the starburst is also powerful .",
    "having both powerful an agn and a starburst as energy sources , despite the small far - ir luminosity ( table 7 ) compared to the other firgs may be a problem .",
    "if the superwind heating the soft x - ray / h@xmath6 nebula is mainly driven by a qso instead of starburst , this problem could be relaxed .    the estimate of the intrinsic agn luminosity in ngc6240 relies on the bolometric ( optical to x - ray ) luminosity of a hidden seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc1068 ( @xmath36(14 mpc/@xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the distance to ngc1068 and @xmath39 is the fraction of light from the hidden nucleus reflected into our line of sight ) given by pier et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "the validity of their estimate is justified by the fact that they used polarization measurements , which are expected to be affected little by possible stellar light contamination , otherwise the derived intrinsic luminosity of ngc1068 ( and thus ngc6240 ) would be overestimated .",
    "the central source of ngc6240 should be occulted by thick material with a column density over @xmath40  along the line of sight . since",
    "no strong evidence for an agn has been found in this galaxy , apart from the hard x - ray spectrum , the powerful starburst masks the agn phenomenon in a more heavily - obscured region inside .",
    "although the x - ray emission with the hard spectrum above 3 kev may be attributed to an agn , the observed x - ray luminosity is quite small ( @xmath41 ) , compared to the infrared luminosity and the reddening - corrected optical luminosity ( @xmath42 , boksenberg et al 1977 ) , both of which are in the range of qsos .",
    "the nucleus of mrk231 clearly shows manifestations of a seyfert-1 or bal qso type active nucleus in various wavebands .",
    "the broad ( fwhm@xmath43 ) h@xmath6 was measured at luminosity of @xmath44  by boksenberg et al ( 1977 ) , while armus et al ( 1990 ) measured @xmath45  within the central @xmath25 kpc region .",
    "the observed small x - ray luminosity is difficult to understand as a normal seyfert 1 or qso .",
    "the good correlation between 210 kev and h@xmath6 luminosity ( log[l(210kev)/l(h@xmath12)]@xmath46 ) found in seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos ( ward et al 1988 ) predicts that the 210 kev luminosity of mrk231 would be ( 27)@xmath47 , which is at least 10 times higher than the observed value .",
    "the difference between the two h@xmath6 measurements could be due to variability of the line , and may suggest a declining central source .",
    "an inspection of the x - ray data from earlier mission like heao-1 however suggests that the past activity in the hard x - ray band was also weak ( @xmath48 ; the x - ray flux expected from the ( 210kev)h@xmath6 correlation and the boksenberg et al ( 1977 ) measurement is below the flux limit ( @xmath49from the heao-1 a2 survey by piccinoti et al 1982 ; rieke 1988 gave an upper limit of @xmath50  based on the heao-1 a1 survery ) .",
    "possible explanations for the x - ray quietness are discussed below .",
    "the hard x - ray component may be attributed to high temperature gas produced by a starburst .",
    "a powerful starburst which is two orders of magnitude more luminous than m82 is required if simply scaled .",
    "the lack of detection of of high excitation lines in the iso / sws mid - ir spectrum of mrk231 and inferred large reddening ( rigopoulou et al 1998 ) may support this hypothesis .",
    "however , many properties , not usually seen in starburst galaxies but in agns ( e.g. , broad h@xmath6 , strong optical feii emission , etc . ) , have to be explained by a starburst alone .",
    "the variability in one of the absorption - line systems ( boroson et al 1991 ; kollatschny , dietrich & hagen 1992 ) and nonthermal radio continuum ( condon et al 1991 ) does not favour this hypothesis but a compact single object , i.e. , agn . the dominance of a nonstellar source in the near - ir band is also suggested from the very weak co absorption band ( majewski et al 1993 ; ridgway et al 1994 ; shier et al 1996 ) .",
    "therefore there are many difficulties to explain without a powerful agn .",
    "the weak x - ray luminosity could be explained by a reflection - dominated object .",
    "a similar 210 kev x - ray luminosity to that of ngc6240 implies that the intrinsic luminosity of the hidden central source would be as large as @xmath35 .",
    "this hypothesis is , however , inconclusive without detection of a strong fe k line , and the apparent seyfert 1 nature needs explanation .",
    "the loose upper limit on the ew of the fe k line ( @xmath51 kev ) can not rule out this possibility .    in this hypothesis ,",
    "the central source must be absorbed completely even in the x - ray band .",
    "however , the reddening implied for the uv / optical continuum ( @xmath52 , boksenberg et al 1977 ; hamilton & keel 1987 ; smith et al 1995 ) is far too small . to hide only a central x - ray source behind the optically thick matter",
    ", the obscuration must occur on very small scale ( well inside the broad line region ) .",
    "the variability time scale ( a few years ) of the absorption system ( boroson et al 1991 ) suggests that the inner 1pc of the nucleus is seen .",
    "since x - ray emission appears to be generated within 10 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath53 pc for a @xmath54  black hole ) , the occultation has to occur on scales between @xmath55 pc to 1 pc .",
    "disk warping ( maloney , begelman & pringle 1996 ) may be responsible for this , although how a large column density in the line of sight can be achieved is uncertain .",
    "assuming that we are seeing an intrinsically x - ray quiet qso nucleus through moderate obscuration by low ionization gas , may be a straightforward explanation .",
    "bal qsos have been recognized as significantly weak soft x - ray sources from rosat observations ( green & mathur 1996 ) . whether it is due to large absorption or low luminosity intrinsic to the central sources",
    "is still uncertain ( mushotzky 1997 ) , although there is one example showing that absorption seems to be the case ( mathur , elvis & singh 1995 ) .",
    "if the hard x - ray emission detected with asca is the direct radiation from the nucleus , the x - ray source in mrk231 would be intrinsically x - ray quiet ( @xmath56 ) as well as being absorbed ( @xmath57 , see table 4 ) .",
    "this x - ray quiet hypothesis would also bring a serious problem with the x - ray heating ( photoionization ) model of feii ( e.g. , netzer 1987 ; collin - souffrin et al 1988 ) .",
    "the intrinsic deficit of hard x - ray photons fails to explain the fact that mrk231 is one of the ` extreme feii emitters ' ( feii / h@xmath58 , lipari 1994 ) .",
    "the correlation between soft x - ray slope and ew(feii ) found by wilkes , elvis & mchardy ( 1987 ) using the data from the einstein observatory is also in the opposite sense to the standard photoionization model .    in order to provide sufficient ionizing uv photons to account for the observed large luminosities of balmer lines and the optical  uv continuum , a large excess in the uv  soft x - ray band , which would however be unobservable because of the moderate absorption ,",
    "is required .",
    "this is possibly related to the class of ultrasoft agns ( or narrow - line seyfet 1s , boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) which , too , often show strong feii emission .",
    "alternatively , the bulk of the energy for the optical / uv emission may be supplied from a starburst and mechanical heating by the starburst wind is responsible for the feii excitation , as proposed by lipari , colina & macchetto ( 1994 ) and lipari , terlevich & macchetto ( 1993 ) .",
    "the energy distribution of the arp220 is characterized by the enormous far - ir excess , which places the galaxy at the early stage of the evolution scenario of infrared galaxies proposed by sanders et al ( 1988 ) .",
    "the lack of direct evidence for a qso - like central source favours a powerful , young starburst as the major source of the bolometric luminosity . a handful of hints of agn activity , the high [ oiii]/h@xmath59 ratio in the nucleus ( sanders et al 1988 ) and a compact radio core ( lonsdale",
    ", smith & lonsdale 1995 ) can be reconciled with photoionization by hot stars ( e.g. , ` warmer ' , terlevich & melnick 1985 ) and a cluster of radio supernovae ( smith , lonsdale & lonsdale 1998 ) , respectively .",
    "a highly obscured starburst can account for the ` ionizing photon deficit ' problem ( depoy et al 1987 ; leitherer & heckman 1995 ; armus et al 1995 ) .",
    "no detection of strong hard x - ray emission ( @xmath60 kev ) fails to provide any evidence for a powerful agn .",
    "however , this does not readily rule out the possibility of a deeply buried agn as a major source of the far - ir luminosity , because the starburst in arp220 does not appear to be sufficiently powerful , as discussed below .    the observed h@xmath6 and soft x - ray emission in arp220 are consistent with the superwind scenario ( heckman et al 1996 ; section 6.1.1 ) . importantly , in the superwind model , the luminosity of the nebular emission depends on the mechanical luminosity of starburst winds .",
    "therefore the soft x - ray and h@xmath6 emission in arp220 , one order of magnitude less luminous than ngc6240 , may suggest that the starburst taking place in arp220 is much weaker than in ngc6240 despite the larger far - ir luminosity .",
    "this speculation is consistent with the conclusion of scoville et al ( 1997 ) , based on the weak mm - waveband free - free emission where dust is no longer optically thick",
    ".    a possible explanation for the weak mechanical luminosity can be found if an upper mass cut - off ( say , at 30 ) in the initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed .",
    "this argument has also been discussed for the ionizing photon deficit problem .",
    "the absence of a population of massive stars would result in a smaller kinetic energy of the starburst wind which is provided predominantly by type ii supernovae and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars while low mass stars power the far - ir luminosity .",
    "few wr stars , that evolve from o stars with an initial mass of larger than 2040 , would exist .",
    "the lack of wr feature ( at @xmath61 ) in the optical spectrum is consistent with this .",
    "recombination lines from hii regions would also remain weak because of fewer ionizing stars ( stars with @xmath6220 ) .",
    "the rather ` tepid ' iras colour agrees with the dominance of low mass stars as a primary heating source of the far - ir emission , since dust grains heated by such population of stars mainly contribute to the iras 60  and 100  range ( mouri & taniguchi 1992 ) .",
    "although this idea of a truncated imf may partly solve the problem , the star formation rate estimated from the far - ir luminosity still overproduces the mechanical luminosity by a factor of @xmath635 more than needed to account for the observed soft x - ray / h@xmath6 luminosities ( heckman et al 1996 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the starburst in arp220 is less powerful than the other firgs in terms of the mechanical luminosity .    a deeply buried starburst ( @xmath64 , sturm et al 1996 ) inferred from the iso spectroscopy is not seen in the x - ray data .",
    "the column density @xmath65 , deduced from @xmath64 is no longer opaque in the hard x - ray band ( e.g. , @xmath3 kev ) .",
    "however , no hard x - ray emision expected from such an obscured starburst is detected in the asca spectrum .",
    "the observed 210 kev luminosity of arp220 ( table 7 ) is a factor of 6 smaller than that scaled from the luminosity of m82 using the far - ir luminosity .",
    "at least the x - ray data do not verify a starburst in a heavy ( @xmath64 ) obscuration to be particularly powerful .",
    "if the far - ir emission of arp220 is instead powered by an agn , it must be a compton - thick source .",
    "because of their faintness in x - ray , compton - thick agns are usually hard to detect . only nearby objects like ngc1068 were detectable in the past x - ray surveys .",
    "however , such sources appear to be common . a recent bepposax survey has found a number of compton - thick seyfert 2s ( salvati et al 1997 ) .",
    "the other far - infrared excess galaxies such as ngc4945 ( iwasawa et al 1993 ; done et al 1996 ) , the circinus galaxy ( matt et al 1996 ) and ngc6240 ( iwasawa & comastri 1998 ) also contain agns hidden behind obscuration with @xmath18 .",
    "a difference between these compton - thick sources and arp220 would be the covering factor of the obscuration .",
    "no detection of even the reflection - dominated x - ray spectrum means a central x - ray source to be covered by an extremely thick matter almost completely .",
    "very little hot dust irradiated by a central agn would then be visible , which is consistent with the cool characteristic temperature of the far - ir emission in the iras band .",
    "therefore a starburst taking place at the smaller optical depth ( @xmath66 , or @xmath64 ) would dominate the spectrum from near - ir to mid - ir as observed .",
    "the far - ir dominance in the spectral energy distribution is similar between firgs and seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "there are indications that starbursts can be a significant energy source in seyfert 2 galaxies ( heckman et al 1995 , 1997 ) and the outer parts of the obscuring matter of agns may be the place where the starbursts are occurring . perhaps powerful firgs are even more heavily obscured version of seyfert 2s .",
    "starbursts appear to dominate the emission of firgs in the near - ir to mid - ir band .",
    "however , the optical depth to the starburst regions is still small compared with that to the hidden x - ray sources in some firgs ( ngc6240 , ngc4945 ) .",
    "arp220 might also be the case .",
    "when the obscuration of a central source is not thick enough ( say , a few times of @xmath67  in ) , agn features would emerge in the optical  mid - ir spectrum ( mrk273 ) .",
    "some ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) with a clear seyfert-2 optical spectrum or polarized broad - line region have been found to harbour an absorbed x - ray source with  values of order of @xmath67(mrk273 , this work ; mrk463e , ueno et al 1996 ; iras20460 + 1925 , ogasaka et al 1997 ; iras23060 + 0505 , brandt et al 1997 ) .",
    "they can be considered as luminous versions of classical seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "however , no significant x - ray detection has been reported for hyperluminous galaxies at higher redshift , like iras f15307 + 3252 ( fabian et al 1996 ; ogasaka et al 1997 ) and iras f10214 + 4724 ( no detection with 80 ks asca observations while 2@xmath68 detection with rosat reported by lawrence et al 1994 ) despite clear seyfert-2 characteristics of their optical emission - line spectra ( cutri et al 1994 ; rowan - robinson et al 1991 ; serjeant et al 1998 ) .",
    "no detection , at least in the rosat band , has been reported for a further four hyperluminous galaxies , iras f00235 + 1024 , f12514 + 1027 , f14481 + 4454 and f1537 + 1950 ( wilman et al 1998 ) . for iras",
    "p09104 + 4109 ( kleinmann et al 1988 ) , cluster emission surrounding the hyperluminous galaxy dominates the observed x - rays ( @xmath69 , fabian & crawford 1995 ) .",
    "the lack of strong hard x - ray emission in hyperluminous galaxies poses the same problem as with arp220 .",
    "if a powerful agn exists , only faint scattered light would be emitted and the upper limit of the l(210kev)/l(fir ) ratio for iras f15307 + 3252 ( @xmath70 , ogasaka et al 1997 ) is still consistent with the known cases of ngc1068 and ngc6240 for which the ratio is @xmath71 .",
    "if an agn is intrinsically weak , a central massive black hole may not have grown enough to emit qso luminosity while a powerful starburst provide the bulk of the bolometric luminosity , which would explain the x - ray quiet nature .",
    "fabian et al ( 1998 ) has proposed a nearly spherical obscuring geometry on 100 pc scale rather than a pc scale toroidal one for the major contributors to the x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "ulirgs may be extreme cases of much larger column density .",
    "primary obscuration of a central x - ray source ( e.g. , @xmath72 ) perhaps occurs at small radii ( @xmath73 pc ) otherwise total mass becomes exceedingly large while molecular gas clouds , composing a moderate obscuration on hundreds pc scale , absorb the radiation escaping from the inner region .",
    "the small opening fraction of the large - scale absorbing shroud makes the scattered light weak .",
    "it should be noted that a high covering fraction of obscuration is demanded to explain the xrb with the obscured agn models ( setti & woltjer 1989 ; madau , ghisellini & fabian 1994 ; celotti et al 1995 ; comastri et al 1995 ) .",
