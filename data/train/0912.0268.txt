    "the deviation from scale invariance of the primordial scalar power spectrum is a critical prediction of inflation , and unlike other potential signatures such tensor modes or non - gaussianity , it is the only signature that is _ generic to all inflationary models_. it is therefore a vital test of the inflationary paradigm , and we address it with a minimally parametric approach .",
    "briefly , the idea is as follows . choose a functional form which allows a great deal of freedom in the form of the deviation from scale invariance ( _ e.g. _ smoothing splines ) . naively fitting this to the data will lead one to fit the fluctuations due to cosmic variance and experimental noise , with arbitrary improvement in the chi - square . instead , one performs cross - validation : throw out some of the data ( the validation set ) , fit the rest ( the training set ) , and see how well it predicts the validation set .",
    "a very good fit to the training set , which poorly predicts the validation set , indicates over - fitting of noisy data .",
    "the final ingredient in the algorithm is a roughness penalty , a parameter that penalizes a high degree of structure in the functional form . by performing cross - validation as a function of this penalty",
    ", one can judge when the amount of freedom in the smoothing spline is what the data require without fitting the noise . a minimally parametric power spectrum reconstruction combined with a roughness penalty set by cross - validation",
    "thus provides a method of determining smooth departures from scale invariance which avoids two pitfalls .",
    "firstly , a strong theory prior on the form of the power spectrum ( _ e.g. _ the commonly used power law prescription ) can lead to artificially tight constraints on  even a spurious detection of  a deviation from scale invariance , which is mostly due to the strength of the prior than that of the data . secondly",
    ", simple binning techniques @xcite or direct inversion @xcite of the data to obtain the primordial power spectrum can lead one to fit noisy data with a large improvement in chi - square / d.o.f .",
    "( easily plausible with current data ) , it would not be surprising to see an improvement of @xmath0 relative to a smooth power spectrum by `` fitting the noise '' with a power spectrum containing a high degree of structure . ] . a minimally parametric approach combined with cross - validation",
    "avoids these issues , providing a way to actually determine the strength of the shape prior justified by the quality of the data .",
    "cross - validation would also be helpful for alternative minimally - parametric methods @xcite _ e.g. _ in choosing the number of basis functions .    in this work ,",
    "we use the best available data over a wide range of scales corresponding to the longest `` lever arm '' of wavenumbers currently extant , to reconstruct the shape of the primordial power spectrum in a minimally - parametric way .",
    "esa s planck satellite , which has already begun taking data , is expected to provide superior constraints @xcite on the shape of the primordial scalar power spectrum by 2012 .",
    "our goal here is to establish a benchmark of what was known about the shape of the power spectrum before the planck analysis .",
    "we perform a minimally - parametric reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum based on the method of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the simplest inflationary models , which are consistent with the data , predict the primordial power spectrum to be a smooth function , we search for smooth deviations from scale invariance with a cubic smoothing spline technique ( for details , see refs .",
    "@xcite which we only briefly summarize here ) . in this approach ,",
    "one aims to recover a function @xmath1 from measurements @xmath2 at @xmath3 discrete points @xmath4 .    consider a description of @xmath5 by a piecewise cubic spline @xmath6 .",
    "it is uniquely defined by the values of @xmath7 at @xmath8 `` knots '' once we ask for continuity of @xmath6 and its first and second derivatives at the knots , and two boundary conditions : we require the second derivative to vanish at the exterior knots . in our application",
    ", @xmath6 is the primordial power spectrum @xmath9 , and the data are : the angular power spectrum of the 5 year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap5 ) cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and polarization @xcite ; alone or in combination with higher resolution , ground - based cmb experiments ( quad @xcite and acbar @xcite ) ; or with large scale structure data : the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) power spectrum @xcite ; and the lyman - alpha forest ( ly@xmath10 ) power spectrum constraints from ref .",
    "this work thus represents a significant advance over previous work @xcite , with a new wmap release ( two further years of data and a significant advance in the understanding of systematic errors ) plus substantial improvements in both ground - based cmb data and large - scale structure data .",
    "we use 5 to 7 knots depending on the data set considered ( see table  [ tab : specs ] for details ; the locations of the knots in @xmath11 space are indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig : cvcmb ] and [ fig : cvlss ] ) . if the knot values were allowed infinite freedom and were set simply by minimizing the chi - square , in general the reconstruction would fit features created by the random noise present in the data .",
    "it is therefore necessary to add a roughness penalty which we chose to be the integral of the second derivative of the spline function .",
    "the roughness penalty is weighted by a smoothing parameter : by increasing the smoothing parameter the roughness penalty effectively reduces the degrees of freedom , disfavouring jagged functions that `` fit the noise '' .",
    ".[tab : specs ] the cross - validation set - up and the adopted number of knots for each data set used in the analysis .

    "that is , the data set is split into two halves , say , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "cross - validation is a useful tool to check for indications of unidentified systematic biases in the data .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that the 3 year wmap data ( wmap3 ) by itself favored a primordial power spectrum with a downward deviation from a power law at small scales ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "however , this feature disappeared when combining wmap3 with other data sets ( see figs . 3 and 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) which overlapped wmap3 on the scales corresponding to the feature  an inconsistency suggestive of a small residual systematic effect in the high @xmath25 wmap3 data . ref .",
    "@xcite argued ( based on considerations of frequency dependence ) that the unresolved residual point source contribution to be subtracted from the raw @xmath43 should have been smaller by @xmath44%  and its uncertainty increased by 60%  compared to the wmap3 official values . to judge",
    "if smoothing spline cross - validation could give some insights on possible residual systematic errors , we investigated how the point source subtraction level should have been changed for the aforementioned downturn at small scales to disappear from the reconstructed power spectrum .",
    "we obtained a point source amplitude @xmath45% lower than the wmap estimated value , which is tantalizingly close to the estimate of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we find that wmap5 , cmb experiments at smaller scales , and the lrg power spectrum are all consistent with each other . with the addition of ly@xmath10 data ,",
    "a lower penalty value is allowed .",
    "this could be a tentative indication of possible tension between ly@xmath46 and the other data sets , but not a very significant one : there is a cancellation between the effect of penalty and the effect of the likelihood over a wide range of penalty values as shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fourpanel ] ) . in addition , as lrg and ly@xmath10 scales do not overlap , we can not exclude the possibility of a low - significance local feature in the power spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmbdr7 ] we show the reconstructed @xmath37 for the cmb and lrg data , with optimal penalty @xmath35 .",
    "the cv setup for wmap5 is the same as before , lrgs are added in cv@xmath22 , and quad+acbar are included together in cv@xmath23 .",
    "we have excluded the ly@xmath10 data as it is the only non - overlapping data set . for comparison",
    ", we also show the 95% and 68% @xmath47 constraints @xcite for wmap5@xmath38lrg data when a power - law spectral index is assumed to describe the shape of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "we see no evidence that any @xmath11-dependence of @xmath47 is necessary to describe the data in the cv reconstruction . while @xmath48 is disfavoured , the significance of the departure from scale invariance is weaker than when the `` inflation - motivated '' power law spectral index prior is adopted .",
    "this minimally - parametric reconstruction highlights how constraints relax when generic forms of @xmath9 are allowed .",
