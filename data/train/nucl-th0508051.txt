    "a generalized concept in present theoretical physics is that description of all physical phenomena should be derivable from first principles in a unified way .",
    "however , the bridge towards concrete applications requires elaborated procedures and judicious arguments .",
    "this is the case of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which is the accepted theoretical model for the strong interactions . despite the fact that it is perturbative in the high energy regime , the fundamental state of matter corresponds to the opposite limit , where confinement and the breakdown of symmetries make it mathematically intractable .",
    "different effective models , such as nambu- jona lasinio , skyrme , bag - like , and chiral perturbation theory attempts to translate the main features of qcd into the hadronic phase . on the other hand , lattice simulations and qcd sum - rules share this aim , although using different methods .",
    "+ qcd sum - rules is a ingenious procedure to reveal the foundations of certain hadronic properties .",
    "the method is based on the evaluation of correlation functions in terms of quarks and gluons degrees , then applying the operator product expansion it is possible to express it as combinations of perturbative contributions and condensates ( non - perturbative ) .",
    "finally this expansion is connected with the hadronic counterpart by means of a borel transformation .",
    "the method was developed to study meson @xcite as well as baryon @xcite properties in vacuum , it was subsequently generalized to study finite density systems @xcite .",
    "these calculations provide a useful guide for some static properties of hadrons immersed in a dense medium , as concerning qcd symmetries and phenomenology .",
    "however , they are not able to take into account the dynamical aspects of hadronic matter , which may be achieved by inserting coherently these results into a theoretical model of hadronic interactions .",
    "+ a similar situation was found in the study of nuclear structure , as the standard combination of _ microscopic _ potentials and the relativistic dirac - brueckner approximation for nuclear matter gives rise to reliable , density dependent , nucleon self - energies .",
    "notwithstanding , this procedure was inadequate to treat finite nuclei due to unsurmountable mathematical difficulties . a feasible solution to this dilemma",
    "was proposed in @xcite , by defining density dependent meson - nucleon vertices in terms of the self - energies obtained in dirac - brueckner calculations .",
    "the enlarged hadronic model keeps the mathematical versatility of the quantum hadrodynamic models @xcite , but is equipped with couplings reflecting the properties of the nuclear environment .",
    "the structure of spherical nuclei , in the medium to heavy range , was studied within this framework using the hartree approximation .",
    "+ further improvements , developed in @xcite , replace the density dependence of the meson - nucleon vertices by an expansion in terms of in - medium nucleon condensates .",
    "this conceptual replacement restores the covariance and the thermodynamical consistency of the model , giving rise to the density dependent hadronic field theory ( ddhft ) .",
    "it was recently appended by introducing momentum dependent vertices @xcite , and a expansion of the vertices in terms of meson mean field values @xcite .",
    "+ the validity of the method is only justified _ a posteriori _ , and relies in the flexibility of hadronic field models to accommodate pieces of information provided by another field of research . the enlarged model yields a simpler and more intuitive description , instead of making involved calculations based on first principles interactions .",
    "a significative exemplification of this standpoint was given by the brown - rho scaling of hadronic masses .",
    "taking into account the chiral and scale symmetries of qcd solely , an approximate scaling law for the in - medium hadronic masses was derived in @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis was applied to describe heavy ion collision , reaching an excellent agreement with the experimental results for the low mass dilepton production rate @xcite .",
    "+ given a set of physically meaningful self - energies as input for ddhft , there is room for a full family of hadronic models , according to the field parameterization assumed for the vertices . in principle , this may lead to different predictions for nuclear observables .",
    "this point has not been investigated yet , and it is the main purpose of the present work .",
    "+ in a previous paper @xcite , the author attempted to make use of the scheme outlined above to relate nuclear observables with qcd inspired results . for this purpose we took as input the nucleon self - energies in symmetric nuclear matter obtained in @xcite by using qcd sum rules .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite does not exhaust the physical description given there , as it covers isospin asymmetric nuclear matter also .",
    "so , we aim to complete our theoretical model including isospin degrees of freedom , based on the results presented in @xcite .",
    "we have organized this work presenting in the following section the general features of ddhft , and particularly the meson parameterization of the hadronic vertices . in section [ seciii ]",
    "we present and discuss the results for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "a final summary is given in section [ seciv ] .",
    "as mentioned above , ddhft was designed to incorporate into the hadronic field formalism pieces of information produced by other theoretical frames . strictly speaking",

    "the masses have been fixed at the phenomenological values @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 mev , @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 mev , and @xmath23 mev .",
    "the iso - scalar vertices are assumed to depend on the scalar combinations : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , whereas the isovector @xmath17 could depend linearly on @xmath28 , or @xmath10 , and on the scalars @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",

    "these parameters are very useful in regard to collective phenomena of the dense nuclear environment , as for instance , phase transitions , the giant monopolar and quadrupolar modes , or the sound velocity @xcite . in order to keep track of the momentum dependence , we assume a non - zero spatial component of the self - energy @xmath168 , the baryonic current @xmath169 and the omega meson @xmath170 , taking the zero limit of these quantities at the end of the calculations .",

    "+ for a given model of self - energies , the result for @xmath187 does not depend on the field parameterization of the vertices .",
    "the parameter @xmath188 instead , depends on @xmath189 which certainly differs for each of the instances ( a - c ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the density dependence of both landau parameters is shown , significative departures for @xmath188 are found for densities above @xmath190 .",
    "+ consequently all physical magnitudes depending solely on @xmath187 , such as the nuclear compressibility @xmath191 , do not distinguish among the field parameterization of the vertices .",
    "the same feature is shared by the giant monopole mode energy @xmath192 , with @xmath193 , and the first sound velocity @xmath194 . on the other hand ,",
    "the excitation energy of the quadrupole state is given by @xmath195 , with @xmath196 , therefore it is sensitive to the approach used .",
    "we have obtained in our calculations @xmath197 mev , @xmath198 mev , and @xmath199 mev at the normal density , which must be compared with the empirical values 230 mev @xmath200 270 mev , @xmath201 mev , and @xmath202 mev .",
    "+ another interesting phenomenological property that can be related to the landau parameters , are the zero sound modes .",
    "these are longitudinal collective modes propagating in nuclear matter at zero temperature , whose dispersion relation can be found as the zeros of the longitudinal dielectric function @xmath203 with @xmath204 and @xmath205 the lindhard function .",
    "collective modes have been studied in detail within relativistic field models , see for instance @xcite .",
    "low lying collective modes can be classified as instability modes , in the low density regime , and zero sound modes with a characteristic linear dispersion relation @xmath206 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the dispersion relation in terms of the baryonic density is shown for the standard ddhft treatment and for the approaches ( a - c ) , within the self - energy parametrization of @xcite .",
    "these results are appropriate for the regime @xmath207 , but keeping the linear dispersion relation .",
    "the instability and zero sound modes are clearly distinguishable , as the first one is closely related to the equation of state , all the corresponding curves practically coincide .",
    "the zero sound yields very different behaviors , the extremum values for its threshold are obtained within the approaches ( b ) and the standard ddhft treatment .",
    "we have obtained @xmath208 and @xmath209 , respectively . in all the cases",
    "we have obtained two - folded zero sound , and taking into account that @xmath210 has non zero imaginary part for @xmath211 , only the upper mode is undamped .",
    "we have examined in this work , two definitions for the vertices of a hadronic field model in terms of the self - energies provided by another theoretical framework .",
    "the first one is the standard ddhft treatment , which uses eqs .",
    "( [ ddhft ] ) to define the vertices @xmath212 between nucleon and scalar and vector mesons , respectively .",
    "there , @xmath213 denotes the nucleon self - energies , based on dirac - brueckner calculations with one - meson exchange potentials .",
    "although vector and scalar dependencies have been stated @xcite , most practical applications have used only the first one , similar to our case ( a ) .",
    "this particular choice has the property of reproducing the equation of state of the source calculations , but on the contrary the self - energies formally differ from the inputs @xmath213 .",
    "an alternative definition was proposed in @xcite , it consisted in equating both , the input self - energy and that evaluated within the hadronic model with vertices depending on scalar combinations of hadronic fields .",
    "this procedure ensures a coherent overlap of the effective hadronic field model and a more _ fundamental _ theoretical description , at least in the baryon sector .",
    "three different parametrizations of the vertices , cases ( a - c ) , and two theoretical sources , namely the qcd sum rules of ref . @xcite and the dirac - brueckner parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite , have been examined within this scheme .",
    "+ thermodynamical aspects of symmetric nuclear matter evaluated in mfa , are undistinguishable for the instances ( a - c ) within the approach of @xcite , see eqs.([casea]-[casec ] ) , but they differ noticeably from the standard ddhft results .",
    "although the almost perfect coincidence within the ( a - c ) approaches for the energy and pressure , the vertices obtained present significative deviations in the medium to high densities regime .",
    "the results for @xmath214 are similar in the ( b ) and ( c ) instances , as they use parametrizations in terms of variables strongly related in the mfa .",
    "we have given fittings for all the vertices in terms of its corresponding variables .",
    "+ in reference to the theoretical source for the inputs @xmath213 , the parameterization given in @xcite yields observables in agreement with the nuclear matter phenomenology , as expected .",
    "the qcd sum rules instead , do not provide an acceptable description , at least in its present status .",
    "taking the nucleon self - energies proposed in @xcite , we have presented formal expresions for the vertices of a hadronic field model for both isoscalar and isovector channels .",
    "however , examination of the binding energy obtained for symmetric nuclear matter , show a qualitative mismatching .",
    "this assertion is in opposition to the preliminary results of @xcite , where the vector meson contribution to the energy density was not taken into account correctly .",
    "however we have shown that the functional dependence of the isoscalar self - energies given in @xcite is not completely reasonless , so as a redefinition of its numerical parameters produce a satisfactory equation of state .",
    "+ we have also considered in detail the landau parameters for symmetric nuclear matter , under the four assumptions and the parametrization of @xcite .",
    "the hadronic model yields two non - zero landau parameters @xmath215 and @xmath216 , the first one has a common behavior while the second one strongly depends on the vertices definition .",
    "therefore , nuclear observables depending on @xmath215 only , such as isothermal compressibility , first sound velocity and the giant monopole energy , give almost coincident values . those quantities depending on @xmath216",
    "may discriminate among the different approaches , for instance the zero sound modes exhibit very different threshold densities according to the choice made .",
    "+ to sum up , we have compared several formal schemes of merging external physical information into hadronic field models . for this purpose",
    "we have introduced interaction vertices @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which are functionals of the hadronic fields , and we have determined them by else the standard ddhft procedure or by requiring the reproduction of the self - energies used as input . either of them , yield comparable results for the binding energy and pressure of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "however , physical quantities can be found able to distinguish among the different approaches .",
    "+ qcd sum rules calculations for the nucleon self - energy , do not meet the requirements of the procedure , however further refinements could improve its performance .",
