    "chaos synchronization has been receiving a great deal of interest for more than three decades @xcite . in particular ,",
    "chaos synchronization in arrays of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems has been extensively investigated over the years in view of its diverse applications in spatially extended systems , neural process , networks , etc .",
    "linear arrays with periodic boundary condition ( ring geometry ) have been used widely in modeling physiological , biochemical and biological phenomena @xcite .",
    "for example , morphogenesis in biological context @xcite and transitions between different animal gaits have been explained by considering a model composed of a ring of coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "an important application of the ring geometry is that the resulting spatiotemporal patterns in the ensemble of coupled oscillators can be analyzed through symmetry arguments @xcite .",
    "recently several interesting dynamical properties / collective behaviors including amplitude death and chimera states have been identified in such a ring type configuration  @xcite .",
    "some of the recent studies have considered synchronization dynamics in both ring and linear arrays coupled together in order to understand the dynamics of basic units of networks @xcite .",
    "recently , interesting scaling behavior of correlation properties of interacting dynamical systems in such a configuration has been demonstrated  @xcite",
    ". however , most of the studies have considered unidirectional coupling in both the ring and linear arrays .",
    "because of the diverse nature of interaction in real world phenomena , we have considered diffusively ( nearest - neighbor ) coupled chaotic systems with ring geometry driven by an external identical drive in view of its widespread applications in engineering , robotics , networks , and physiological and biological systems  @xcite . for instance , cultured networks of heart cells are examples of biological structures with strong nearest - neighbor coupling @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of size instability , where a critical size of the number of oscillators upto which a stable synchronous chaotic state exists , of a uniform synchronous state in arrays of coupled oscillators with both periodic and free - end boundary conditions have been widely studied  @xcite . increasing the number of oscillators beyond this limit leads to desynchronization and the occurrence of spatially incoherent behavior ( eg . , high - dimensional or spatiotemporal chaos ) .",
    "the stability of synchronous chaos in coupled dynamical systems plays a crucial role in the study of pattern formation , spatiotemporal chaos , etc .",
    "@xcite . in this connection , using the paradigmatic models of rssler and lorenz oscillators we shall demonstrate in this paper that the maximal number of oscillators in the ring geometry that can support stable synchronous chaos can be increased by integer multiples of the original number of oscillators in the ring with additional couplings from the same drive oscillator .",
    "furthermore , it is also found that the critical coupling strength and the number of oscillators which can be synchronized in the ring exhibit an exponential relation with a scaling exponent and indeed the relation remains unaltered even on increasing the number of couplings between the drive and the ring .",
    "in addition , the synchronization error displays a power law decay as a function of the noise intensity for a fixed value of the coupling strength indicating the existence of noise enhanced / induced synchronization .",
    "it is to be noted that small world networks can be generated by introducing additional couplings between randomly selected nodes to create shortest paths ( links ) between distant nodes  @xcite .",
    "further , recent studies on synchronizability of networks have been employing pinning control in which hubs in the networks are connected to the same drive node  @xcite as in our present study .",
    "in particular , we consider here the rssler and lorenz oscillators in a ring geometry with diffusive coupling between them and driven by an external identical oscillator , whose strength is proportional to a parameter @xmath5 ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) below ) . based on numerical simulations , we find that the critical coupling strength , say @xmath3 , below which no synchronization exists @xmath6 , of the external drive increases exponentially with a scaling exponent , @xmath7 , as a function of the number of oscillators in the array that supports a stable synchronous state .",
    "further we observe that the number of oscillators which supports such a stable synchronous state can be increased in integer multiples by introducing additional couplings at the @xmath0-th oscillator of the ring with same value of the coupling strength , where @xmath1 is the number of couplings and @xmath2 is the maximum number of oscillators in the ring that can sustain stable synchronization with a single coupling .",
    "interestingly , this exponential relation is maintained while increasing the number of couplings , @xmath1 , between the array and the external drive .",
    "in addition , we have found that @xmath3 shows an exponential decay as a function of the number of additional couplings between the drive and the response array for a fixed number of oscillators in the array .",
    "further , we find that these results are robust against gaussian white noise of small intensity and the synchronization error exhibits a power law decay as a function of the noise intensity .",
    "these results also indicate the existence of both the phenomena of noise - enhanced and noise - induced synchronizations depending on the value of the coupling strength @xmath5 beyond certain threshold values of the noise intensity .",
    "it is to be emphasized that all the numerical simulations throughout the manuscript have been repeated with several initial conditions and the results are the averages of a large number of realizations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we study synchronization in rings of diffusively coupled rssler and lorenz systems driven by external identical oscillators with a drive - response configuration . we show that in both the cases the critical coupling strength increases exponentially with the number of oscillators in the response array with a scaling exponent . in addition , the systems exhibit a power law decay of the synchronization error as a function of the noise intensity demonstrating noise - enhanced and noise - induced synchronizations depending on the value of the coupling strength . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we demonstrate that the size of the ring can be increased beyond the size instability limit by integer multiples of the maximum number of synchronized oscillators ( @xmath2 ) in the ring with a single coupling for the same value of coupling strength . we also show that the same scaling relation with a characteristic exponent is valid for the case of arbitrary number of couplings also .",
    "further , we examine the effect of noise on the robustness of the synchronous state for a fixed value of the noise intensity and as a function of the noise intensity for a fixed value of the coupling strength in all the cases . finally , in sec .",
