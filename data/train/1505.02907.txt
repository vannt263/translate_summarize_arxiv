    "we assume the standard @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 = 0.30 , and @xmath13= 0.70 .",
    "several assumptions are made .",
    "first , the clouds mainly consist of hydrogen and are partially ionized .",
    "second , the clouds are blobs at the distance @xmath14 from the central black hole .",
    "dynamical equilibrium corresponds to circular orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "third , the clouds are in the circular orbits .",
    "fourth , the clouds are optically thin to the thomson scattering .",
    "a cloud has a mass @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the total number of hydrogen in the cloud and @xmath17 is the mass of hydrogen atom .",
    "the cloud is subject to the gravity of the central black hole with a mass @xmath3 , and the gravity @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath14 is the orbital radius of this cloud .",
    "the cloud is exerted with a centrifugal force @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the circular velocity .",
    "here , we consider two origins of continuum radiation pressure forces on a cloud : the thomson scattering of the central source radiation by free electrons , and the recombination and re - ionization of hydrogen ions that will continue to absorb ionizing photons to compensate for the recombination . the recombination line photon number per unit time , i.e. , the recombination rate of the ionized hydrogen , is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient , @xmath26 is the number density of the free electrons , @xmath1 is within @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the number of the hydrogen ions . on the hydrogen ionizing timescale @xmath29 , the neutral hydrogen atoms from the recombination are re - ionized into the hydrogen ions with a number @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",

    "the estimated results of @xmath0 are presented in table 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the comparisons of @xmath0 to @xmath2 . for case a ,",
    "four agns with seambhs and three cfhqs quasars have @xmath89 ( see figure 1a and table 1 ) . for case",
    "a , 9 agns match @xmath7 ( see figure 1a ) . for case",
    "b , all agns match @xmath89 , and 30 agns follow @xmath90 ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "these comparisons show that the continuum radiation pressures of the central engines have a significant influence on the black hole virial mass estimates on the basis of the reverberation mapping method .",
    "the masses @xmath0 are sensitive to the percent of ionized hydrogen atoms @xmath1 in the clouds .",
    "for some agns , such as iras f12397 , iras 04416 , and j1641 + 3755 , the continuum radiation pressures can counteract about 3040 percent gravitational forces of @xmath3 ( case a ) .    in the plots of @xmath0 versus @xmath2 ,",
    "the seambh agns , the cfhqs quasars , and the rest of agns populate in the narrow zones ( see figure 1 ) . from this view point , the seambh agns at @xmath91 and the cfhqs quasars at @xmath92 are not essentially different .",
    "this means that their central black holes are likely accreting at the very high rates , regardless of the environments surrounding these agns , but maybe related to the environments surrounding the central black holes , such as dusty tori and accretion disks .",
    "also , some of the rest of agns are at the similar accretion rates to those of the seambh agns and the cfhqs quasars . whether or not the continuum radiation pressure is considered to estimate @xmath3 depends on the ratio of @xmath93 .",
    "the radiation pressure must be considered as @xmath94 that will lead to underestimate @xmath3 by a factor @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 . when @xmath97 , @xmath3 will be underestimated by a factor @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the importance of the continuum radiation pressure can not be neglected in estimating @xmath3 for the high accretion rate agns .",
    "there is a undetermined parameter @xmath1 , the ionization percent of the blr clouds , in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "two values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 are assumed to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "these assumptions may lead to some unreasonable results . following the strmgren radius of a strmgren sphere of ionized hydrogen around a young star @xcite , an ionization depth of a cloud",
    "is defined as the position where the recombination rate equals the ionization rate , and the hydrogen atoms are fully ionized . as",
    "the recombination and ionization are in equilibrium , the ionizing photon number arriving at one cloud per unit time equals the recombination line photon number per unit time .",
    "the ionizing photon number arriving at the cloud per unit time is @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the cross - section area of the cloud , @xmath104 is the ionizing photon number emitted by the central engine per unit time ( @xmath105 the mean energy of photons ) , @xmath106 is the ionization parameter of hydrogen , and @xmath58 is the hydrogen number density of the cloud . at the same time , the ionized region of the cloud produces the recombination line photon number per unit time @xmath107 , where @xmath26 is the electron number density in this region , and @xmath108 is the fully ionized volume of the cloud .",

    "a gas density of @xmath115@xmath116 is required by a very large lyman continuum optical depth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the gas density values are the same as those in @xcite for quasars and seyfert galaxies .",
    "@xcite got @xmath117 .",
    "a density of @xmath118 is set by the presence of broad semi - forbidden line c  iii@xmath119\\lambda 1909 $ ] and the absence of broad forbidden lines such as [ o  iii@xmath119\\lambda \\lambda 4363,4959,5007 $ ] @xcite .",

    "the cloud size of @xmath121@xmath122 was constrained by the smoothness of the emission - line profiles @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed a universal ionization parameter @xmath114 in the inner photoionized layer of the blr clouds , independent of luminosity and distance .",
    "the radiation pressure confinement of the photoionized layer appears to explain the universality of the blr properties in agns , the similar relative line strength over the vast range of @xmath123@xmath124 @xmath70 in luminosity @xcite .",
    "a widely accepted power - law relation has been established between the luminosity @xmath125 and the blr size @xmath14 , as @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "this power - law relation spans over a range of @xmath127 in @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "so , @xmath129 will be independent of @xmath86 , @xmath34 , and @xmath14 .",
    "this independence may lead to a universal ionization parameter as suggested in @xcite .",

    "we have @xmath134 @xmath135 , and then @xmath136 0.20.6 .",
    "thus , it is basically reasonable to take @xmath75 and 0.5 in the calculations of @xmath0 .",
    "so , the masses counteracted by the continuum radiation pressures of the central engines are not negligible compared to , or are comparable to the black hole virial masses at least for some agns ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this counteracting effect of the continuum radiation pressure is significant for quasars at @xmath92 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "j0100 + 2802 at @xmath137 has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath138 and a black hole mass of @xmath139 , and it is the most luminous quasar known at @xmath140 @xcite .",

    "there are the same cases for the cfhqs quasars as in j0100 + 2802 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "their masses @xmath3 are larger than the virial masses @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite suggested for @xmath146 quasars that the supermassive black holes in the early universe likely grew much more quickly than their host galaxies .",
    "the larger black hole masses @xmath3 of the quasars at @xmath92 further strengthen this suggestion .",
    "thus , it is important to consider the radiation pressure effect on the black hole mass estimates for the agns with the high accretion rates .",
    "this importance of the radiation pressure is consistent with that suggested by @xcite who argued for narrow - line seyfert 1 galalxies , and seems to be inconsistent with the suggestions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an assumption of isotropy in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is made for the central source luminosity @xmath35 .",
    "this assumption might be significantly influence the estimated values of @xmath0 , and then the results of this paper .",
    "the anisotropic illumination of a blr by the central radiation was discussed by @xcite , and recently was investigated by @xcite .",
    "the central radiation of quasars are anisotropic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite derived bolometric corrections based on the theoretical accretion disk models of @xcite , and obtained an anisotropic correction factor of @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 is the total source luminosity assuming isotropy .",
    "@xcite got a factor of @xmath150 for quasars .",
    "so , we take @xmath151 , i.e. , @xmath152 to re - estimate @xmath0 , and the re - estimated @xmath0 are compared to @xmath2 in figure 2 .",
    "considering the anisotropy of the central source luminosity @xmath35 , the continuum radiation pressure effects on the black hole masses @xmath3 can not be still neglected for the close- and super - eddington limit accretion rate agns .",
    "thus , the anisotropy of the central source luminosity could not influence significantly the main results assuming isotropy .",
    "@xcite proposed the seambh agns as the most luminous standard candles in the universe .",
    "since a part of the seambh agns and the cfhqs quasars have the same behaviors in the plots of @xmath0 versus @xmath2 , the cfhqs quasars likely have the potential to be the most luminous standard candles in the universe .",
    "this potential will extend the redshifts of the most luminous standard candles from @xmath153 up to @xmath92 , and will be important to study the universe because of extending significantly the cosmic distance beyond the range explored by type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "an average column density of a cloud is @xmath154 ( @xmath120 and @xmath155@xmath156 ) . the electron thomson scattering optical depth of the cloud is @xmath157 , and the cloud is optically thin , which confirms the fourth assumption of the model",
    ". the ionizing optical depth of the cloud is @xmath158 , and the cloud is optically thick to the ionizing photons .",
    "the cloud has the strmgren radius smaller than its thickness .",
    "so , the cloud is partially ionized , confirming the first assumption of the model , and this is consistent with the constraints set by the reverberation mapping observations . the radiation pressure force ratio of the second to the first term in equation ( 3 ) has averages @xmath1596.3 for agns in table 1 .",
    "the first term of the free electron thomson scattering is comparable to the second term of the recombination and re - ionization of the hydrogen ions .",
    "the second term becomes more important as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the partly ionized clouds will be ionized more as @xmath34 increases , and the second term would be more important as the central engines become brighter .",
    "the radiation pressure forces due to absorption of ionizing photons and thomson scattering were used to modify the expression for the black hole virial mass @xmath2 ( see equation 5 in * ? ? ? * ) . as @xmath160@xmath161 , the modified @xmath2 becomes larger by a factor of @xmath162100 for the agns accreting around the eddington limit . in consequence , j0100 + 2802 at @xmath137 will have @xmath3 @xmath163@xmath164 that is nearly impossible to the eddington limit growth of black holes in the early universe because of the larger initial masses of primary black holes .",
    "if considering the line - driven radiation pressure force @xcite , the radiation pressure force due to the gas opacity will be @xmath165 times that due to the electron scattering opacity @xcite .",

    ", the radiation pressures can counteract at least about 3040 percent gravitational forces of the black holes for some agns ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "four seambh agns at @xmath169 and five cfhqs quasars at @xmath170 are around the line @xmath171 for @xmath75 ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "thus , the continuum radiation pressures of the central engines have to be considered in estimating the black hole masses for the agns accreting around the eddington limit , regardless of the redshifts or the surrounding environments of agns . the most luminous quasar j0100 + 2802",
    "likely has the same case as the nine agns ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
