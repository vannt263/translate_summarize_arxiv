    "construction of chiral gauge theories is one of the long - standing problems of lattice field theories . because of the fermion doubling phenomenon , a naively discretized lattice fermion field yields @xmath0 fermion modes , half of one chirality and half of the other , so that the theory is non - chiral .",
    "several lattice approaches have been proposed to define chiral gauge theories , but so far none of them have been proven to work successfully .",
    "kaplan has proposed a new approach@xcite to this problem .",
    "he suggested that it may be possible to simulate the behavior of massless chiral fermions in 2k dimensions by a lattice theory of massive fermions in 2k+1 dimensions if the fermion mass has a shape of a domain wall in the 2k+1-th dimension .",
    "he showed for the weak gauge coupling limit that massless chiral states arise as zero - modes bound to the 2k - dimensional domain wall while all doublers can be given large gauge invariant masses .",
    "if the chiral fermion content that appears on the domain wall is anomalous the 2k - dimensional gauge current flows off the wall into the extra dimension so that the theory can not be 2k - dimensional .",
    "therefore he argued that this approach possibly simulates the 2k - dimensional chiral fermions only for anomaly - free cases .",
    "his idea was tested for smooth external gauge fields .",
    "jansen@xcite showed numerically that in the case of the chiral schwinger model in 2 dimensions with three fermions of charge 3 , 4 , and 5 the anomalies in the gauge currents cancel on the wall .",
    "the chern - simons current far away from the domain wall was calculated in ref .",
    "it is shown that the 2k+1-th component of the current is non - zero in the positive mass region and zero in the negative mass region such that the derivative of the current cancels the 2k - dimensional gauge anomaly on the wall , as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the continuum perturbation theory frolov and slavnov@xcite proposed a gauge invariant regularization of the standard model through an infinite tower of regulator fields .",
    "some similarity between their proposal and the kaplan s approach was pointed out by narayanan and neuberger@xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that the chiral fermion determinant can be nonperturbatively defined as an overlap of two vacua@xcite , which can be extended to lattice theories . using narayanan and neuberger s point of view",
    ", we observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that non - gauge ( chiral ) anomalies are correctly reproduced within the frolov and slavnov s regularization method .",
    "the results above provide positive indications that kaplan s method for chiral fermion may work .",
    "there exists , however , several potential problems in his approach .",
    "since the original 2k+1-dimensional model is vector - like , there always exists an anti - chiral mode , localized on an anti - domain wall formed by periodicity of the extra dimension .",
    "if the chiral mode and the anti - chiral mode are paired into a dirac mode , this approach fails to simulate chiral gauge theories . without dynamical gauge fields ,",
    "the overlap between the chiral mode and the anti - chiral mode is suppressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the size of the extra dimension .",
    "if gauge fields become dynamical , the overlap depends on the gauge coupling . in the original paper@xcite",
    "the strong coupling limit of the gauge coupling in the extra dimension was proposed to suppress the overlap .",
    "however , a mean - field calculation@xcite in this limit indicated that the chiral mode disappears and the model becomes vector - like .",
    "more recently distler and rey@xcite pointed out that the kaplan s method may have a problem in reproducing fermion number non - conservation expected in the standard model . using the 2-dimensional chiral schwinger model they argued that either the 2-dimensional fermion number current is exactly conserved or the light degree of freedom flows off the wall into the extra dimension so that the model can not be 2-dimensional .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a detailed perturbative analysis of the kaplan s proposal for smooth background gauge fields on a finite lattice taking the chiral schwinger model in 2-dimensions as a concrete example . in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we formulate the lattice perturbation theory for the kaplan s method with the periodic boundary condition .",
    "since translational invariance is violated by domain wall mass terms , usual feynman rules in the momentum space can not be used except in the regions far away from the domain wall@xcite . to perform perturbative calculations near or on the wall",
    ", we use the feynman rules in real space of the extra dimension , as proposed in ref .",
    "we calculate the fermion propagator for the periodic boundary condition , which reproduces the fermion propagator in ref.@xcite near the origin of the extra dimension .",
    "a similar calculation is also made for the constant fermion mass with _",
    "free _ boundaries in the 2k+1-th dimension .",
    "as shown by shamir@xcite the constant mass term with this boundary condition can also produce the chiral zero mode on the 2k - dimensional boundary .",
    "the results are similar but simpler than those by the kaplan s method . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2dim ] , using the feynman rules of sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] we calculate a fermion one - loop effective action for the u(1 ) gauge field of the chiral schwinger model simulated by the kaplan s method .",

    "this result is compared with those of the conventional wilson fermion formulation of this model@xcite . in sect .",
