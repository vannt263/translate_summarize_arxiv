    "the breaking of large amplitude electron plasma waves / oscillations has been receiving a great attention since 1959 due to it s basic interest and practical importance @xcite .",
    "it has wide applications to some current research problems ranging from laboratory plasma to astrophysical plasma where breaking of large amplitude electron plasma waves are consistently encountered@xcite .",
    "for example , recent experiments on plasma acceleration @xcite by laser and particle beam have shown that the breaking of excited plasma oscillations / waves plays a major role in the particle acceleration process .",
    "wave breaking is also important for first ignitor concept in inertial confinement thermonuclear fusion@xcite .",
    "the concept of wave breaking in a cold homogeneous plasma was introduced by dawson@xcite , where thermal motion was neglected and ions were fixed .",
    "dawson demonstrated that the amplitude of applied perturbation can not be increased beyond a critical limit , known as wave breaking limit , as the trajectory of the neighbouring electrons constituting the oscillation / wave start to cross each other beyond this limit .",
    "this results in fine scale mixing of various parts of the oscillation which destroys the oscillation / wave@xcite .",
    "but , when non - linear density perturbations are excited in a large amplitude plasma wave , thermal effects may become important as the electron thermal pressure may not allow the density compression to build up as predicted by the simple cold plasma fluid model .",
    "in 1971 , coffey@xcite investigated this phenomena for electron plasma wave in a warm plasma by using the simplest distribution _",
    "i.e. _ `` water - bag '' distribution @xcite for electrons . unlike in the cold plasma case where the wave - breaking limit is defined by trajectory crossing , in the case of warm plasma coffey",
    "defined wave breaking as the trapping of background plasma electrons in the wave potential .",
    "an analytical expression for the maximum electric field amplitude and density amplitude as a function of the electron temperature has been derived which shows that temperature effects significantly reduces the wave breaking limit@xcite .",
    "+ verification of this effect of plasma temperature in reducing the wave breaking amplitude had been attempted by kruer@xcite , mulser@xcite and bergmann _ _ et al.__@xcite using 1d vlasov simulation , for resonantly driven plasma wave in an inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that coffey s limit can not be applied for resonantly excited waves .",
    "here we want to emphasize that coffey s limit was derived for a propagating wave using homogeneous plasma approximation and verification of coffey s limit for a freely running electron plasma wave in a homogeneous plasma where electron distribution is maxwellian has never been carried out to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the results presented by bergmann",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite clearly show that , when a small fraction of particles are trapped in the wave potential , the periodic structure of the wave is still unaffected and wave does not break .",
    "this periodicity dies out when a large number of particles are get trapped .",
    "so , the pertinent question is , how to quantify this number , such that if particles greater than this number get trapped the wave will break ? + in a recent paper , trines _ _ et al.__@xcite has answered this question by giving a very clear definition of wave breaking in a warm plasma . according to these authors , since in a warm plasma electrons have a distribution of velocities , therefore there always exists a small fraction of particles having velocities larger than the phase velocity of the wave .",
    "these particles obviously get trapped sooner or later by the potential ; so if wave breaking is equivalent to the background particle trapping , then every longitudinal plasma wave in a warm plasma will always break . to resolve this conflict , a new quantity ,",
    "electron sound speed @xmath0 has been introduced , which is same as the upper boundary of water - bag distribution@xcite , as shown in the next section . according to trines@xcite",
    ", the particles having initial velocity @xmath1 are contributing to the wave propagation but the particles with velocity @xmath2 are not contributing to the wave propagation . to break the wave the particles which are taking part in the wave motion ( @xmath1 ) has to be",
    "get trapped .",
    "therefore , the longitudinal wave breaking in a warm plasma is defined as the trapping of background plasma electrons having an initial forward velocity @xmath3 .",
    "+ in this present paper , we verify coffey s wave breaking limit for a large amplitude propagating wave in a maxwellian plasma and study its stability towards a small amplitude longitudinal perturbation using particle in cell ( pic ) simulation method@xcite . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we derive an equation for a propagating wave by considering water - bag distribution for electrons .",
    "this equation is already derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we present this for the sake of completeness .",
    "maximum electric field amplitude ( @xmath4 ) and density amplitude ( @xmath5 ) as a function of electron temperature ( @xmath6 ) is also derived in this section . in first portion of section [ section3 ]",
    "we determine the initial conditions needed to excite a large amplitude propagating wave solution and describe how to load them in a pic code . in the second portion of section [ section3 ]",
    "we verify two things , ( i ) does coffey s limit hold for a propagating wave in a maxwellian plasma ? and ( ii ) does the definition of wave breaking as given by trines _",
    "et al . _ in terms of particle trapping holds good ?",
    "finally we conclude in section [ section4 ] .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the breaking of electron plasma wave in the framework of coupled vlasov - maxwell equations which can be written as @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9    the exact analytical solution of the above equations using a maxwellian distribution for electrons is mathematically complicated .",
    "therefore , here we start from a water - bag distribution ( @xmath10 ) as used in the refs .",
    "@xcite . according to this model , electron distribution function is constant in a bounded region ( @xmath11 at @xmath12 , @xmath13 at @xmath14 ) of phase space and is zero outside this region .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to solve the equations at the boundaries of the phase space . for a water - bag distribution",
    "the heat flux is zero @xcite so that there is a closure to the hierarchy of the moments of the vlasov equation .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is determined by @xmath16 , which gives @xmath17 and the value of @xmath18 is determined by requiring that the second order moment of water - bag distribution be as same as that for a maxwellian distribution _ i.e _",
    "@xmath19_{water - bag } = \\left",
    "[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}v^2fdv \\right]_{maxwellian}$ ] which yields , @xmath20 .",

    "now we find the value of maximum electric field @xmath4 supported by this electron plasma wave in the following way : + representing @xmath44 and integrating eq.([eq12 ] ) , we get @xcite @xmath45    where we have used @xmath46 at @xmath47 . + here @xmath48 .",

    "[ fig7 ] shows that as the time progresses the amplitude of the primary mode reduces significantly with the simultaneous growth in higher order modes . as a consequence",

    "[ fig8 ] we present the evolution of particle kinetic energy and electrostatic energy of the wave upto @xmath106 1000 plasma periods and find that as time progresses the wave energy reduces and energetic particles are produced which is a signature of wave breaking as has been reported by several authors@xcite .",

    "[ fig12 ] corresponds to the electron plasma wave with amplitude @xmath110 , perturbed by a small amplitude longitudinal perturbation such that the maximum electric field amplitude after adding perturbation ( @xmath104 ) becomes larger than the coffey s limit . in figs .",

    "a black vertical line is also drawn at electron sound speed @xmath112 ( or @xmath18 ) . as mentioned by trines _ _ et al.__@xcite , it should be noted here , that the particles which are situated on the left of the vertical black line are taking part in the wave motion ( @xmath3 ) . the evolution of evdf in figs .

    "but the results shown in fig . [ fig12 ] show that when the maximum electric field amplitude is larger than coffey s limit , the vertical red line with time moves towards the body of the distribution and stays on the left side of the vertical black line for all instants of time , which implies that some fraction of particles which are effectively taking part in the wave motion are getting trapped by the wave ( the particles between the vertical red line and vertical black line of the distribution ) .",
    "therefore the wave is loses its periodic character and eventually dies out . so the kinetic picture of wave breaking given by trines _",
    "_ is also verified in our simulations .",
    "the breaking of large amplitude electron plasma wave in a warm plasma has been studied where electron s velocity distribution is taken as maxwellian .",
    "it is shown by pic simulation that coffey s propagating wave solution which was derived by using a water bag distribution for electrons also represents a propagating wave in a maxwellian plasma .",
    "therefore coffey s limit @xcite is valid for a propagating wave in a maxwellian plasma as shown in this paper .",
    "it is also shown that , when the particles having forward initial velocity @xmath3 are get trapped , the wave breaks .",
    "some early evidence of our simulation results can be seen in the experiment on the breaking of super - strong electron plasma wave by bauer _",
