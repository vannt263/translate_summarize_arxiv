    "while experimental confirmation of the existence of hybrid states  hadrons with a gluonic excitation ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . )",
    " remains elusive , much has been done theoretically , both on and off the lattice , to determine possible consequences of their existence .",
    "in particular , mixing of ( non - exotic ) hybrids with normal hadronic states ( with the same @xmath4 ) is expected to occur , necessitating a redefinition of the true hadronic ground state in terms of its constituents : e.g. , |=",
    "a_s |b|b+ a_h |b|bg+ .... we offer the bottomonium example for a reason : it is this system which we study with our simulations .",
    "since this system is composed of relatively heavy quarks , we use the nonrelativistic approximation to qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite when we perform the lattice simulations .",
    "nrqcd has been used before to study heavy hybrids @xcite .",
    "the main difference in the current study is the fact that we apply the lowest - order ( in @xmath5 ) spin - dependent interaction ( @xmath6 ) `` perturbatively , '' i.e. , at a single time slice .",
    "then , using different source and sink operators ( quarkonium @xmath7 hybrid , and _",
    "vice versa _ ) , we are able to extract the off - diagonal matrix element of the hamiltonian for this quarkonium - hybrid two - state system .",
    "we then diagonalize this new hamiltonian and find the admixture of hybrid within the true ground state @xcite .",
    "in our implementation of nrqcd , we use a time - step - symmetric form of the heavy quark evolution operator @xcite : & & 1 - ^n u^_t(x ) 1 - ^n & &  ( 1 - _ t,t^ ah ) g ( , t ) , with a value of @xmath8 ( more than sufficient for stability , @xmath9 ) . for simplicity , we use only the lowest - order term of the heavy quark expansion in the diagonal part of our hamiltonian : h_0 = , where @xmath10 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the spin - dependent term appears in the interaction h = c_b^ , which is applied only at a single , intermediate time slice , @xmath11 .    .",
    "meson operators . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for our lattice mesons , we use an incoherent sum of point sources : at the source end , we start with a given quark color and spin at all spatial points , without fixing the gauge ; at the sink end , we sum over all the contributions where the quark and anti - quark are at the same spatial point . since the lattices are not gauge - fixed , we expect the contributions from sources with the quark and anti - quark at different spatial points to average to zero .",
    "we combine the quark and anti - quark sources ( propagators ) with the appropriate spin matrices and gauge fields to construct the meson operators at the source ( and sink ) time slices .",
    "the meson operators we use are displayed in table  [ operators ] .    using identical source and",
    "sink operators , `` unmixed '' meson ( and hybrid ) propagators are constructed .",
    "we use the following form to fit the resulting correlators : c(t ) = a_0 e^-m_0^t + a_1 e^-m_1^t .",
    "for the `` mixed '' propagators , the source and sink operators differ ( quarkonium @xmath7 hybrid , and _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "these are also fit with a two - exponential form . however , since the source and sink operators are different , and since there is the single interaction ( @xmath12 ) at the intermediate time slice ( @xmath11 ) causing the mixing between these configurations , the first exponential in this fit can be expressed as & & a_0,src^1/2a_0,snk^1/2 1| c_b^|1 & &  e^-m_0,src^t e^-m_0,snk^(t - t ) + .... knowing the amplitudes and masses from the unmixed propagators and fitting this correlator in the region @xmath13 , we extract the off - diagonal matrix element .",
    "we then repeat this calculation for larger and larger values of @xmath11 in search of a plateau , indicating the decay of excited - state contributions ( e.g. , from @xmath14s@xmath15 or @xmath14h@xmath15 , depending on the source ) to the mixed amplitude .",
    "the heavy meson propagators are evaluated on a set of quenched , improved lattices ( 100 configurations with symanzik 1-loop - improved gauge action , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; see ref .",
    "the lattice spacing is determined using the spin - averaged 1s-1p mass splitting for bottomonium ; @xmath18 ( 440 mev)@xmath19 mev .",
    "we also construct non - zero - momentum @xmath20 s - wave propagators and use the resulting dispersion relation to determine the kinetic mass for this meson .",
    "this kinetic mass is calculated for two input values of the quark mass ( @xmath21 and 2.8 ) and an interpolation is then performed to match this meson mass to the experimental value for the mass of the @xmath22 ( 9.46 gev ) .",
    "we thus arrive at a ( lattice - regularized ) physical value for the mass of the bottom quark ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "appearing in fig .",
    "[ sigmabfig ] are the results for the off - diagonal matrix element , plotted as a function of the interaction time slice , @xmath11 .",
    "after diagonalization of the hamiltonian , the hybrid content of the ground state is found and expressed in terms of a mixing angle ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "a plot of this quantity versus @xmath11 is shown in fig .  [ sinsfig ] . as can be seen in both of these figures ,",
    "a plateau is reached at rather low values of @xmath11 . using the values at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and interpolating in the quark mass to the physical value",
    ", we find the following configurations for the @xmath22 and @xmath27 ground states : & & -  0.057(1 )  |1(1^ ) , & & +  0.097(2 )  |1(0 ^ -+ ) , with the tree - level value @xmath28 .    in an attempt to determine @xmath29",
    "nonperturbatively , we perform additional runs with the interaction , @xmath12 , applied at _ all _ intermediate time slices and with the values of @xmath28 and 2 .",
    "we then use the @xmath30 mass difference ( a quantity having a quadratic dependence upon the @xmath31 term ) to set the value of @xmath32 . unfortunately , as there is no experimental value for the mass of the @xmath33 , we rely on potential model results @xcite which put this mass difference in the @xmath34 mev range . combining this with our lattice results for the mass difference  @xmath35 and 71.3(2.1 ) mev for @xmath28 and 2 , respectively  suggests @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting probability admixtures of hybrids within the bottomonium ground states thus become |1||^2 ~0.0054 - 0.011 , |1|_b^|^2 ~0.016 - 0.032 . obviously , the uncertainty is dominated by the lack of a reliable value for the @xmath30 mass difference .",
    "note the factor of @xmath37 enhancement for the mixing in the @xmath38 channel , due to spin statistics @xcite .",
    "interested readers can find a more detailed discussion of the results for the @xmath20 channel in ref .",
