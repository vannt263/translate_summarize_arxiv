    "because of recent exciting algorithms , like the factoring algorithm of shor @xcite and the search algorithm of grover @xcite , that solve difficult problems on a quantum computer using algorithms that would be impractical on a classical computer , it is easy to overlook that the original proposals for quantum computers were for the purpose of solving quantum physics problems @xcite . people like feynman @xcite focused on the extent to which such a computer could imitate a specific physical process , suggesting in part that quantum problems were inherently too complex for a classical computer @xcite .",
    "the obvious difficulty with deterministically solving a quantum many - body problem ( of fermions or bosons ) on a classical computer is the exponentially large basis set needed ( i.e. , the dimension of its hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "exact diagonalization approaches ( e.g. , the lanczos method ) suffer from this exponential `` catastrophe '' . viewed the other way around , this basis set scaling is what restricts today s classical computer to simulating only small quantum computers .",
    "this point seems indisputable , but should not be taken as proof that quantum systems can not be simulated on a classical computer . by the same token , the recent claim @xcite that quantum computers can simulate all quantum systems efficiently lacks explicit and detailed algorithms for specific problems , and lacks a generic model of quantum computation including the unitary maps ( quantum gates ) that can be physically implementable . even if a quantum computer existed , some interesting quantum problems , such as finding the ground state of a general quantum hamiltonian , do not yet have efficient quantum algorithms .",
    "finding such a quantity for small systems is relatively routine on a classical computer .",
    "feynman in fact analyzed two alternatives for simulating physics with computers @xcite .",
    "one uses a probabilistic classical computer that would produce from the same input as given to a physical system the same distribution of outputs as observed for the physical system .",
    "the other uses a computer constructed of distinctively quantum mechanical elements that obey the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "this latter proposal is the quantum computer .    to the question ,",
    "`` can quantum systems be probabilistically simulated by a classical computer ? '' , feynman s answer was unequivocally `` no . ''   this answer is surprising for even at that time some quantum systems were being very successfully simulated probabilistically on classical computers , mainly by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods @xcite . to the question ,",
    "`` can quantum systems be simulated with a quantum computer ? '' , his answer was a qualified `` yes . ''",
    "he believed almost certainly that this could be done for a system of bosons but was unsure that it could be done for a system of fermions . in this paper",
    "we present a design for a universal quantum computer that will simulate a system of fermions . before doing so , we first discuss some problems that can be solved by a probabilistic simulation of a quantum system on a classical computer and others that can not .",
    "probabilistic simulations of quantum systems on a classical computer are mainly performed with the use of the monte carlo method .",
    "these statistical approaches were introduced to overcome the difficulty of exponentially growing phase spaces by numerically evaluating the accompanying many - dimensional integrals by sampling from a function assumed to be non - negative . on a classical computer one can probabilistically simulate a quantum system like liquid he@xmath0 @xcite and produce results that accurately compare with experiment .",
    "the situation , however , is far from satisfactory .",
    "an unsatisfactory state of affairs results from the frequent breakdown of the non - negativity assumption and is called `` the sign problem . ''",
    "the sign problem is manifested by the seemingly exponentially hard task of estimating the expectation value of an observable with a given error .",
    "interestingly , feynman s negativism about quantum systems being probabilistically simulated by classical computers was a claim that negative probabilities were unavoidable because of the `` hidden variable '' problem and the possible violation of bell inequalities . the extent to which the sign problem is a hidden variable problem is unclear .",
    "on the other hand , qmc methods do not faithfully adhere to feynman s idea of a probabilistic computer .",
    "two important differences are that most qmc simulations are non - local and performed in imaginary time .",
    "feynman discussed real - time simulations on a local computer .",
    "implications of these differences have been noted by ceperley @xcite who suggests feynman really argues just against simulating quantum dynamics on a local classical computer . in any case ,",
    "probabilistic simulations on a classical computer clearly do not qualify as a _",
    "universal _ computational scheme for general quantum many - body problems .",
    "the limiting factors , for whatever reasons , are negative or complex - valued probabilities whether the simulations are done in real or imaginary time .    to place the sign problem in a better perspective , we will start with a real - time analysis of a collection of interacting quantum particles .",
    "quantum mechanics tells us that these particles either obey bosonic statistics , whereby the wave function is symmetric with respect to the exchange of the states of any two particles , or obey fermionic statistics , whereby the wave function is antisymmetric ( changes sign ) with respect to the exchange of any two particles @xcite .",
    "examples of bosons are photons and gluons ; examples of fermions are electrons , protons , neutrons , and quarks .",
    "often these two quantum statistics conveniently and efficiently map onto a third , quantum spin statistics @xcite .",
    "still in other cases , when particle exchange is unlikely , particle statistics is simply ignored .    for a given initial quantum state @xmath1 ,",
    "a quantum computer solves the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath2 by incrementally propagating the initial state via @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and the hamiltonian @xmath5 is assumed time independent ) .",
    "it should be reasonably apparent that if the monte carlo method is applied to the evaluation of the right - hand side of this equation , it is faced with sampling from oscillatory integrands that are not always positive and have unknown nodal surfaces .",
    "further , as time @xmath6 increases , the integrand fluctuates with increasing rapidity .",
    "while clever stationary - phase forms of the qmc method have been developed , acceptable solutions are possible only for relatively short times .",
    "this form of the sign problem is called the _ dynamical sign problem _ , and we are unaware of any efficient @xcite real - time qmc simulations for bosonic , fermionic , or quantum spin systems .",
    "years ago @xcite , before quantum computers were proposed , it was realized that by transforming schrdinger s equation to imaginary - time @xmath7 via @xmath8 the problem with the rapid fluctuations was eliminated . with this transformation ,",
    "called wick s rotation , one solves the diffusion - like equation @xmath9 by incrementally propagating the initial state via @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and the hamiltonian @xmath5 is assumed time independent . )",
    "this transformation permits qmc simulations of time - reversal invariant interacting boson systems to a high degree of accuracy . for systems of interacting quantum spins and fermions ( or bosons with complex hermitian hamiltonians",
    "@xcite ) , the transformation does not solve the sign problem .",
    "for quantum spin systems , the difficulty is finding a basis in which all matrix elements of the positive - definite operator @xmath12 are positive .",
    "most notably this difficulty occurs for frustrated quantum spins . for fermion systems ,",
    "the problem is the monte carlo process causing state exchanges that because of the anti - symmetrization requirement just happen to produce samples which are as frequently positive as negative . for the sign problem found in both types of systems ,",
    "the statistical error of the measured observables grows exponentially fast with increasing system size .",
    "another difficulty with the imaginary - time approach is analytically continuing the results back to real - time if real - time , i.e. , truly dynamical , information is needed @xcite .",
    "this continuation is an ill - posed problem whose solution places extraordinary demands on the simulation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the dynamical sign problem for a system of fermions , seemingly the most challenging case .",
    "eventually we will give a detailed implementation of a simulation of the dynamical properties of a collection of interacting fermions on a quantum computer .",
    "the implementation avoids the sign problem .",
    "first , in section [ section2 ] we will discuss more fully the mathematical origin of the dynamical sign problem in classical computation and show why a quantum algorithm overcomes the problem . in section [ section3 ] we will give the elements required for deutsch s quantum network model of a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the quantum gate in this model conveniently allows the propagation of systems of local two state objects , e.g. , a localized quantum spin-@xmath13 particle called qubit .",
    "we also propose a universal set of quantum gates ( unitary operators ) that allows generic propagation of systems of fermions ( the fabled `` grassmann chip '' @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting fermion algebra has been the main technical tool for studying the classical ising model in two spatial dimensions @xcite , a prototype lattice model that had an enormous impact on our understanding of phase transitions .",
    "next , in section  iv , we show how this propagation can be effected by the quantum spin gate .",
    "we will demonstrate the polynomial scaling of the construction of the initial state , its subsequent time propagation , and the measurement of some observable .",
    "here we will also demonstrate the control of the error in the results . in section [ section4 ] , we apply our model of dynamical fermion computation to a toy problem to illustrate our procedures in more detail .",
    "the exact solution of this toy problem will be given in the appendix ; however , if one were to solve this problem in the obvious hilbert space , its solution would require a quantum computer for a sufficiently large system .",
    "finally , in section [ section5 ] , we summarize and make some remarks about future research directions .    our universal fermion gate and its mapping to the standard universal quantum gate is very similar to the one recently discussed by bravyi and kitaev @xcite who actually propose that a quantum computer built from fermions might be more efficient than one built from distinguishable two state systems .",
    "in order to understand the mathematical origin of the dynamical sign problem we use the feynman path integral formulation @xcite for continuum systems in the first quantization representation . in this formalism one maps a quantum problem in @xmath14 dimensions into a classical one in @xmath15 dimensions and then simulates that problem probabilistically on a classical computer .",
    "the algorithm is efficient except for the repetition needed to obtain sufficiently good statistics .",
    "the `` distinguishable particle '' quantum mechanical propagator of a system represented by the hamiltonian @xmath16 is expressed as @xcite @xmath17 \\",
    "e^{i s \\left[{\\cal r}(t ) \\right ] } \\ , \\label{prop}\\ ] ] where the measure @xmath18 =   \\lim_{m \\rightarrow \\infty } ( 2 \\pi i t / m)^{-m d/2 }",
    "\\ d{\\cal r}_1 \\cdots d{\\cal r}_{m-1}$ ] , and the action @xmath19 = \\int_0^t d \\tau \\left \\ { \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{d { \\cal r}(\\tau)}{d \\tau } \\right ) ^2 - v({\\cal r}(\\tau ) ) \\right\\ } \\ .\\ ] ] bosonic or fermionic statistics are introduced by applying the corresponding symmetrization operator to the propagator , eq .",
    "however , because the dynamical sign problem occurs for any particle statistics , we will ignore particle statistics for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the description of the properties of different physical systems in terms of correlations of physical observables is the natural way to compare with available experimental information . in this",
    "regard , linear response theory provides a way to compute the response of a system to a weak external dynamical perturbation @xcite .",
    "this linear response is always expressed in terms of a time correlation function of the dynamical variables that couple to the perturbation .",
    "for example , if we were to apply an external time - dependent magnetic field and we wanted to calculate the average induced magnetization , we would have to compute a time - dependent magnetization - magnetization correlation function .",
    "the two - time correlation function between arbitrary local dynamical variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 is @xmath22 if the hamiltonian is time independent .",
    "expressed in integral form @xmath23 where the `` distinguishable particle '' density matrix @xmath24 specifies the way the system was initially prepared .",
    "the next step consists of writing eq .",
    "[ cab ] in path - integral form using eq .",
    "[ prop ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real - valued functions .",
    "generically , a stochastic estimate of @xmath28 is @xmath29 where the configurations @xmath30 are sampled from the probability distribution @xmath26 ( positive semidefinite measure ) .",
    "one immediately sees that the origin of the dynamical sign problem is the oscillatory phase factor @xmath31 that leads to large phase fluctuations at long times .",
    "manifestly , @xmath32 in an exponential fashion as @xmath6 gets larger .",
    "therefore , the total statistical error for the evaluation of @xmath28 grows exponentially with time because of large cancellations both in the numerator and denominator .",
    "the so - called `` fermion sign problem '' is a particular case of this problem when @xmath33 and time is imaginary @xcite .",
    "will a quantum computer solve this problem ? at first glance",
    "it appears that it will .",
    "a quantum computer is a physical system , whether a system of fermions or not , and physical systems have no dynamical or fermion sign problems .",
    "furthermore it has been argued that there are means for mapping most physical systems to a quantum computer in such a way that the quantum computer s controlled evolution mimics that of the physical system  @xcite",
    ". a closer look , however , makes the situation less clear .",
    "a quantum computer is a computer , and as such it suffers from limited accuracy .",
    "more importantly this type of computer predicts results stochastically , meaning each measurement is one member of the ensemble of measurements possible from a distribution specified by the modulus squared of the wave function for the hamiltonian @xmath5 modeled by the quantum computer . for a fixed physical time",
    "@xmath34 , how accurate is an individual measurement , how accurate is the expectation value of these measurements , and how controlled is their estimated variance ? is the level of accuracy and control achievable polynomially with complexity and @xmath6 ?",
    "there is an area where a problem similar to the sign problem has been recognized and resolved by quantum computation .",
    "recently it was shown that quantum computation is polynomially equivalent to classical probabilistic computation with an oracle for estimating the value of simple sums of rational numbers called _ quadratically signed weight enumerators _ ( qwgts ) @xcite . in other words , if these sums could be evaluated , one could use them to generate the quantum statistics needed to simulate the desired quantum system .",
    "more specifically , what was demonstrated was the obtainability of expectation value of operators in quantum computation by evaluating sums of the form @xmath35 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath36-@xmath37-matrices with @xmath21 of dimension @xmath38 and @xmath20 of dimension @xmath39 .",
    "the variable @xmath40 in the summand ranges over @xmath36-@xmath37-column vectors of dimension @xmath41 , @xmath42 denotes the transpose of @xmath40 , @xmath43 is the _ weight _ of @xmath40 ( the number of ones in the vector @xmath40 ) , and all calculations involving @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath40 are done modulo @xmath44 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath45 is bounded by @xmath46 .",
    "quantum computation corresponds to the problem of determining the sign of @xmath47 with the restrictions of having @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 being positive integers , and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is a diagonal matrix formed from the diagonal elements of @xmath20 and @xmath53 is a lower triagonal matrix formed from the lower triangular elements of @xmath20 .",
    "details of this quantum algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main point is that these sums are similar to the numerator of eq .",
    "[ cab2 ] , and attempts to estimate them by random sampling result in exponentially bad signal to noise ratios . in the case of qwgts",
    ", quantum computers can estimate the sum exponentially better than classical computers , but the estimate is not exact .",
    "the situation for the dynamical sign problem is similar : quantum computers can not obtain exact values for the desired correlation functions , but can obtain estimates sufficiently exact to avoid the sign problem suffered by the known classical algorithms and to yield usable information about the physical models simulated .    in this paper",
    "we will show explicitly how the sign problem is avoided in the case of simulating fermions .",
    "below we will give a means for translating local fermion hamiltonians into the hamiltonians available in the standard model of quantum computation .",
    "in contrast to quantum simulations on a classical computer this translation prevents uncontrolled exchange processes that are the dominant source of the fermion sign problem . with respect to the dynamical sign problem ,",
    "we then argue by using standard error correction analysis developed for the standard model of quantum computing that these gates will enable sufficiently accurate measurements of correlation functions so the accuracy of the average of these measurements will be dominated by the statistical error .",
    "the statistical error is problem dependent but polynomially bounded , so that the difficulty associated with phase - weighted averages is eliminated .",
    "the _ quantum control _ model of quantum computation assumes the existence of physical systems that can be controlled by modulating the parameters of the system s hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "the control possibilities are abstracted and used to implement specific _ quantum gates _ that represent the unitary evolution of the physical system over a time step obtained by specific modulations of the hamiltonian . in most treatments , the physical systems , together with the gates ,",
    "are then taken as the abstract model of quantum computation .",
    "the quantum control and quantum gate viewpoints are effectively equivalent , but to tie the computational model to the physics simulation problem more closely , we choose to describe quantum computation from the point of view of quantum control ; that is , we will assume an @xmath54 . in this context",
    "we begin by giving the standard model of quantum computation and then defining an alternative model based on fermions .    defining a model of quantum computation",
    "consists of giving an algebra of operators , a set of controllable hamiltonians ( hermitian operators in the algebra ) , a set of measurable observables , and an initial state of the physical system . in the simplest case ,",
    "the observables are measured by the method of projective measurements , and the initial state of the physical system is an expectation value of the algebra s operators .",
    "the standard model of quantum computation ( deutsch s quantum network representation ) is based on an assembly of two state systems called _ qubits _ , controlled by one- and two - qubit hamiltonians , and on a measurement process determined by one - qubit observables .",
    "* operator algebra : * it is convenient to define the standard model through the algebra of operators acting on the qubits .",
    "this algebra is generated by the unit and pauli matrices @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for each qubit @xmath58 , @xmath59 these matrices represent quantum operators with mixed commutation relations and span the space of complex - valued @xmath60 matrices . for qubits @xmath61 , the @xmath62 s commute , and for qubits @xmath63 , they satisfy the relation @xmath64 , ( @xmath65 ) . for a _ quantum register _ with @xmath41 qubits , one may take the operator @xmath66 defined in terms of a kronecker product @xmath67 of matrices acting on @xmath41 two - dimensional linear spaces .",
    "thus @xmath66 admits a matrix representation of dimension @xmath68 .",
    "* control hamiltonians : * control of qubits is achieved by applying hamiltonians that act on either one or two qubits .",
    "a theorem @xcite in quantum information processing says that a generic operation on a single qubit and any interaction between two qubits is sufficient for building any unitary operation .",

    "however , it is often simpler to design the required control by assuming that only one of the @xmath70 is non - zero at any time . a quantum algorithm for this model of quantum computation consists of prescribing the control functions  @xcite .",
    "a convenient measure of the complexity of such an algorithm is the integral @xmath71 ( the _ action _ of the algorithm ) .",
    "the quantum gates are simply specific unitary evolutions that may be implemented in terms of @xmath54 .",
    "a convenient universal set of gates is given by operators of the form @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the quantum network representation of the standard model , an algorithm is a specific sequence of these operators applied to the initial state of the qubits .",

    "it is unnecessary to give an initial state explicitly , as the desired state can be prepared by using measurement and operations . to learn the expectation of an observable at the end of an algorithm , one repeats the algorithm and measurement procedure many times and averages over the measurements until the desired accuracy is achieved .    for a description of the standard model of quantum computation in terms of quantum turing machines ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "quantum networks are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "introductory descriptions of the standard model may be found in  @xcite .",
    "somewhat analogously , we now describe a standard model of fermion computation . for simplicity",

    "any other hamiltonian for a system of interacting spinless fermions can be generated by it .",

    "in particular it is possible to efficiently map the fermion hamiltonians to pauli operators which can be simulated using the control hamiltonians of the standard model .",
    "this establishes that these two models of computation are polynomially equivalent . here",

    "it is relevant to mention that the transformation just presented is a particular case of a more general set of mappings that we would like to name generalized jordan - wigner transformations @xcite .",
    "it is possible to imagine a quantum computer implemented , for example , with a three state unit ( @xmath99=1 ) instead of a qubit .",
    "in such a case , these generalized transformations still allow one to simulate fermions or particles with arbitrary statistics .",
    "two additional comments are in order : the mapping for @xmath78 and @xmath100 described above corresponds to a one - dimensional array of spins .",
    "the extension to higher spatial dimensions can be done @xcite in various ways .",
    "a straightforward extension to two dimensions is to re - map the sites of a two dimensional array onto a one dimensional string and proceed as before .",
    "also there is nothing special about using the fermion instead of a quantum spin as an alternative model of computation .",
    "one could have just as well used the hard core boson @xcite .",
    "the main question is whether different algebras admit a physical realization . for hard - core bosons",
    "this realization is he@xmath0 atoms .",
    "given a fermion model algorithm , it is necessary to efficiently obtain a corresponding standard model algorithm that at least approximates the desired evolution .",
    "the general principle is to map the time - dependent fermion hamiltonian @xmath101 to the standard model operators via the jordan - wigner transformation , express the result in terms of a sum of simple products of pauli operators , and then use the trotter approximation @xmath102 each time step @xmath103 is chosen so that the final error of the simulation is sufficiently small .",

    "requires additional steps that are proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "this number scales polynomially with the complexity so the construction is efficient if the standard model is efficient .",

    "the procedure for measuring @xmath28 can now be summarized as follows : first express @xmath214 and @xmath215 as a sum of unitary operators @xmath216 and @xmath217 . a convenient unitary operator basis that works well for the local observables of interest consists of all the products of pauli operators , as each such product",

    "@xmath201 may be implemented by simulating the evolution under @xmath5 , applying @xmath222 , and then undoing the evolution under @xmath5 .",
    "an alternative approach to the measurement process is von neumann s projection method .",

    "the second comes from the discretization of the evolution operator and the use of the trotter decomposition .",
    "the third is due to the statistics in measuring the desired correlation function using the technique given above .",
    "the problem of gate imperfections can be dealt with by using quantum error correction  @xcite and fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite . according to the accuracy threshold theorem , provided the physical gates have sufficiently low error , it is possible to quantum compute arbitrarily accurately . the fault tolerant computation implements unitary operations and measurements on encoded qubits with overheads bounded by @xmath242 for some @xmath49 .",
    "this exponentially efficient convergence implies that the effects of physical noise can in principle be ignored .",
    "a second type of error is the one introduced by the discretization of the evolution operator .",

    "our technique for measuring the correlation function @xmath247 requires measuring the expectations of unitary operators @xmath248 associated with the implemented evolution . in most cases , the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 are a sum of @xmath249 products of pauli matrices , so that @xmath250 @xmath251 s and @xmath252 @xmath253 s are needed .",
