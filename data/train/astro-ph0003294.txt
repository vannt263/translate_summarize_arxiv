    "emission - line nebulae in galactic nuclei are generally considered to fall into three major categories : star - forming or nuclei , seyfert nuclei , and low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions , or liners .",
    "the formal divisions between these classes are somewhat arbitrary , as the observed emission - line ratios of nearby galactic nuclei fall in a continuous distribution between liners and seyfert nuclei and between liners and nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "traditionally , liners have been defined as those nuclei having emission - line flux ratios which satisfy the relations [ ] @xmath33727/ [ ] @xmath35007 @xmath4 and [ ] @xmath36300/ [ ] @xmath35007 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is possible to construct alternative but practically equivalent definitions , based on other line ratios , which can be applied to datasets that do not include the wavelengths of the [ ] , [ ] , or [ ] lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a sizeable minority of galactic nuclei has emission - line ratios which are intermediate between those of `` pure '' liners and those of typical regions powered by hot stars ; these galaxies would be classified as liners except that their [ ] @xmath36300 line strengths are too small in comparison with other lines to meet the formal liner criteria",
    ". objects falling into this category have been dubbed `` transition '' galaxies by @xcite , and although this nomenclature is somewhat ambiguous we adopt it here for consistency with the spectroscopic survey of @xcite .",
    "that survey defined the transition class in terms of the following flux ratios :    [ ] @xmath35007/h@xmath6  @xmath7 3 , + 0.08 @xmath8 [ ] @xmath36300/h@xmath9  @xmath7 0.17 , + [ ] @xmath36583/h@xmath9  @xmath10 0.6 , + [ ] @xmath116716 , 6731 /h@xmath9  @xmath10 0.4 .",
    "@xcite have used the term `` weak- [ ] liners '' to refer to galaxies having [ ] @xmath36583/h@xmath9  @xmath12 ( typical of liners ) but which have [ ] @xmath36300/h@xmath9  @xmath13 .",
    "this category is essentially identical to the transition class of @xcite , and we will refer to these galaxies as transition objects in this paper .    according to the survey results of @xcite , this transition class accounts for 13% of all nearby galaxies , making them about as numerous as seyfert nuclei .",
    "the hubble type distribution of transition galaxies is intermediate between that of liners , which are most common in e / s0/sa galaxies , and that of nuclei , which occur most often in hubble types later than sb @xcite .",
    "roughly @xmath14 of galaxies with hubble types ranging from s0 to sbc belong to the transition class .",
    "there is not a consensus , however , as to whether these transition objects should be regarded as star - forming nuclei , as accretion - powered active nuclei , or as composite objects powered by an agn and by hot stars in roughly equal proportion .",
    "there is a large body of literature on the subject of the excitation mechanism of liners which is relevant to the similar transition class .",
    "a variety of physical mechanisms has been proposed to explain the emission spectra of liners , including shocks , photoionization by a nonstellar ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray continuum , and photoionization by hot stars .",
    "( see filippenko 1996 for a review . )",
    "the possibility that liners ( and seyfert nuclei as well ) might be photoionized by starlight was raised by @xcite , who suggested that very hot ( @xmath15 k ) wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars in a metal - rich starburst could give rise to an ionizing continuum with a nearly power - law shape in the extreme - uv .",
    "more recent atmosphere models have indicated substantially lower temperatures for w - r stars , however , casting doubt on the warmer hypothesis @xcite .",
    "subsequent photoionization models have attempted to explain liner and transition - type spectra as resulting from massive main - sequence stars .",
    "@xcite found that the spectra of weak- [ ] liners could be explained in terms of photoionization by o3o4 stars having effective temperatures of @xmath16 k , at ionization parameters of @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite carried this line of argument farther , proposing that genuine liner spectra could be generated by early o stars with @xmath19 k , provided that a high - density component ( @xmath20 @xmath2 ) is present in the nlr ; the high densities are needed to boost the strengths of high critical - density emission lines , most notably [ ] @xmath36300 .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by @xcite , who explored the effects of absorption by ionized gas as a means to harden the effective ionizing spectrum .",
    "recent observations , particularly in the uv and x - ray bands , have provided convincing evidence that many liners are in fact agns , particularly the `` type 1 '' liners which have a broad component to the h@xmath9  emission line ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility has remained , however , that some liners and transition nuclei are powered entirely by bursts of star formation .",
    "an important shortcoming of the model calculations performed by @xcite and @xcite is that the ionizing continua used as input were those of single o - type stars ; these studies did not address the question of whether a liner or transition - type spectrum could result from the the _ integrated _ ionizing continuum of a young stellar cluster .",
    "compared with these single - star models , the contribution of late - o and b stars will soften the ionizing spectrum , making the emission - line ratios tend toward those of normal regions .",
    "w - r stars , on the other hand , will harden the ionizing spectrum during the period when these stars are present , roughly @xmath21 myr after the burst .",
    "another drawback of the o - star models is that they require the presence of stars with effective temperatures higher than are thought to occur in regions of solar or above - solar metallicity , in order to produce a liner or transition - type spectrum rather than an region spectrum .",
    "their applicability to galactic nuclei is therefore somewhat unclear .",
    "other mechanisms have been proposed for generating liner or transition - type spectra .",
    "shock excitation by supernova remnants in an aging starburst may give rise to some transition objects ; the nucleus of ngc 253 is a likely candidate for such an object @xcite .",
    "also , post - agb stars and planetary nebula nuclei will produce a diffuse ionizing radiation field which could be responsible for the very faint liner emission ( with h@xmath9  equivalent widths of @xmath22  ) observed in some ellipticals and spiral bulges @xcite .",
    "an alternate possibility is that the transition galaxies may simply be composite systems consisting of an active nucleus surrounded by star - forming regions . for a galaxy at a distance of 10 mpc , for example ,",
    "a 2-wide spectroscopic aperture will include regions within 50 pc of the nucleus .",
    "galaxies having emission lines both from a liner nucleus and from surrounding star - forming regions , in roughly equal proportions , will appear to have a transition - type spectrum .",
    "this interpretation was advocated by @xcite as the most likely explanation for the majority of transition galaxies , and is consistent with the observed hubble type distribution for the transition class .",
    "other authors have similarly contended that transition galaxies are agn/ region composites , based on optical line - profile decompositions @xcite and near - infrared spectra @xcite .",
    "two of the 65 transition nuclei observed in the @xcite survey have a broad component to the h@xmath9  emission line , indicating the likely presence of an agn , and it is probable that many more transition nuclei contain obscured agns which were not detected in the optical spectra . on the other hand , radio observations do not appear to support the composite agn / starburst interpretation . in a vla survey of nearby galactic nuclei , nagar et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find compact , flat - spectrum radio cores in more than 50% of liner nuclei , but in only 6% ( 1 of 18 ) of transition objects .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that the simple picture of an ordinary liner surrounded by star - forming regions may not apply to the majority of transition objects .",
    "recent results from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) have shed new light on the question of the excitation mechanism of transition nuclei .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the uv spectrum of the well - known transition nucleus in ngc 4569 over 1200 - 1600   is virtually identical to that of a w - r knot in the starburst galaxy ngc 1741 , indicating that o stars with ages of a few myr dominate the uv continuum .",
    "@xcite find that the nuclear star cluster in ngc 4569 is producing sufficient uv photons to ionize the surrounding narrow - line region , a key conclusion which provides fresh motivation to study stellar photoionization models .",
    "the brightness of the ngc 4569 nucleus , and the consequently high s / n observations that have been obtained , make it one of the best objects with which to study the transition phenomenon .",
    "the recent availability of the starburst99  model set @xcite has prompted us to reexamine the issue of ionization by hot stars in liners and transition nuclei .",
    "these models give predictions for the spectrum and luminosity of a young star cluster , for a range of values of cluster age , metal abundance , and stellar initial mass function ( imf ) properties . using the photoionization code cloudy @xcite in combination with the starburst99  model continua",
    ", we have calculated the expected emission - line spectrum of an region illuminated by a young star cluster , to test the hypothesis that some liners and transition nuclei may be powered by starlight .",
    "similar calculations have been performed by @xcite , but for the physically distinct case of metal - poor objects representing galaxies .",
    "other examples of photoionization calculations for regions using evolving starburst continua are presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "before describing the photoionization modeling , we review the properties of ngc 4569 , as it is among the best - known examples of the transition class .",
    "ngc 4569 is a virgo cluster spiral of type sab , with a heliocentric velocity of @xmath23 km s@xmath24 , and we assume a distance of 16.8 mpc for consistency with the catalog of @xcite .",
    "its nucleus is remarkably bright for a non - seyfert , and so compact in the optical that @xcite suspected it to be a foreground galactic star .",
    "it is also an unusually bright uv source , with the highest 2200   luminosity of the liners and transition objects observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ hst _  faint object spectrograph ( fos ) spectra show that the uv continuum is dominated by massive stars , with prominent p cygni profiles of @xmath31549 , @xmath31400 , and @xmath31240 @xcite .",
    "the uv spectrum is nearly an exact match to the spectrum of one of the starburst knots in the w - r galaxy ngc 1741 , an object with a likely age in the range 36 myr @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of the ngc 4569 nucleus is dominated by the light of a - type supergiants , providing additional evidence for recent star formation @xcite .    one key result of the @xcite study was the conclusion that the nuclear starburst in ngc 4569 is producing sufficient numbers of ionizing photons to power the narrow - line region , assuming that the surrounding nebula is ionization - bounded , _ even without correcting for the effects of internal extinction on the uv continuum flux_. in fact , there appears to be substantial extinction within ngc 4569 , as demonstrated by the uv continuum slope as well as the presence of deep interstellar absorption features @xcite . @xcite",
    "derive an internal reddening of @xmath25 mag from the h@xmath9/h@xmath6  ratio , while @xcite estimate a uv extinction of @xmath26 mag at 1300   by comparison of the observed uv slope with the expected spectral shape of an unreddened starburst .",
    "despite the fact that ngc 4569 is often referred to as a liner , and in some cases presumed to contain an agn on the basis of that classification , there is no single piece of evidence which conclusively demonstrates that an agn is in fact present at all .",
    "the _ hst _  images and spectra are all consistent with the nucleus being a young , luminous , and compact starburst region .",
    "no broad - line component is detected on the h@xmath9  emission line @xcite , and no narrow or broad emission lines are visible at all in the uv spectrum other than the p cygni features that are generated in o - star winds @xcite .",
    "only the optical emission - line ratios point to a possible agn classification . in a thorough study of optical and _ iue _ uv spectra ,",
    "@xcite concluded that there was at best weak evidence for the presence of an agn in ngc 4569 , and that any agn continuum component , if present , must have an unusually steep spectrum .",
    "furthermore , while the nucleus of ngc 4569 is certainly extremely compact , the uv and optical _ hst _  images show that the nucleus is not dominated by a central point source . at 2200  ,",
    "the nucleus appears extended in wfpc2 images with fwhm sizes of 13 and 9 pc along its major and minor axes @xcite .",
    "optical wfpc2 images have been discussed recently by @xcite , who state that the nucleus is unresolved by _",
    "we have obtained these same images from the _ hst_archive . while the nucleus is certainly compact , we find that it is clearly extended even at the smallest radii .",
    "a 12-second , cr - split exposure in the f547 m ( @xmath27-band ) filter is unsaturated and allows a radial profile measurement .",
    "we find a fwhm size of 14 pc by 8 pc along the major and minor axes , consistent with the size of the nuclear cluster measured at 2200  .",
    "@xcite estimated that at most 23% of the nuclear uv flux could come from a central point source . from the equivalent widths of stellar - wind features in the uv spectrum ,",
    "@xcite give a similar upper limit of @xmath28 to the possible contribution of a truly featureless continuum to the observed uv flux .",
    "x - ray observations of ngc 4569 with _",
    "rosat _ have revealed a source coincident with the nucleus which is unresolved at the 2  resolution of the hri camera @xcite .",
    "this does not necessarily indicate that an agn is present , however , as the optical / uv size of the starburst core is an order of magnitude smaller than the hri resolution .",
    "asca _ observations show that the x - ray emission is extended over arcminute scales in both the hard ( 27 kev ) and soft ( 0.52 kev ) bands @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the compact source seen in the _ rosat _ image is detected only in the soft _ asca _ band , while there is no detectable contribution from a compact , hard x - ray source .",
    "the spectral shape of the compact soft x - ray component is consistent with an origin either in an agn or in x - ray binaries @xcite , but the lack of a compact hard x - ray source argues against the agn interpretation . if an agn is present , it must be highly obscured even at hard x - ray energies , with an obscuring column of @xmath29 @xmath30  @xcite . in radio emission ,",
    "vla observations show that the ngc 4569 nucleus is an extended source with a size of 4  and no apparent core @xcite , in contrast with the compact , agn - like cores found in some liners @xcite .",
    "shock excitation has often been considered as a mechanism to power the narrow emission lines in liners",
    ". however , the lack of narrow emission features in the uv spectrum of ngc 4569 argues against shock - heating models for this object , as existing shock models generally predict strong uv line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "shock - excited filaments in supernova remnants show strong emission in high - excitation uv lines such as @xmath31549 and @xmath31640 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which are altogether absent from the ngc 4569 spectrum .",
    "similarly , the shock - excited nuclear disk of m87 @xcite has a high - excitation uv line spectrum which bears no resemblance to the ngc 4569 spectrum . from an analysis of infrared spectra",
    ", @xcite proposed that the ngc 4569 nucleus is powered by an 811 myr - old starburst , by a combination of stellar photoionization and shock heating from supernova remnants .",
    "while this hypothesis may be applicable to some liners and transition galaxies , the uv spectrum of ngc 4569 shown by @xcite is inconsistent with a burst of such advanced age , as the p cygni features of , , and would have disappeared from a single - burst population after about 6 myr .",
    "the overall picture emerging from these observations is that the ngc 4569 nucleus is a compact , luminous , and young starburst .",
    "the only reason to invoke the presence of an agn at all would be to explain the higher strengths of the low - ionization forbidden lines in comparison with values observed in normal nuclei .",
    "if it were indeed possible for a young starburst to produce transition or liner - type emission lines in the surrounding gas , then there would be no reason to consider agn models for ngc 4569 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the key ingredient necessary for generating a liner or transition - type emission - line spectrum is an ionizing continuum which is harder than that produced by typical clusters of ob stars .",
    "a harder continuum will produce a more extended partially - ionized zone in the surrounding region , boosting the strength of the low - ionization lines which are typical of liner spectra : [ ] @xmath36300 , [ ] @xmath33727 , [ ] @xmath3@xmath36548,6583 , and [ ] @xmath3@xmath36716,6731 .    to represent the ionizing continuum of a young starburst",
    ", we have chosen the starburst99  model set ; we refer the reader to @xcite for the details of the methods used to construct these models .",
    "briefly , the starburst99  code employs the geneva stellar evolution models of @xcite , with enhanced mass - loss rates , for high - mass stars .",
    "atmospheres are represented by the models compiled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figures 112 of @xcite display the spectral energy distributions of the starburst99  model clusters for a range of burst ages and for a variety of initial conditions . from the figures ,",
    "some important trends are readily apparent . during the first 2 myr after an instantaneous burst ,",
    "the continuum is dominated by the hottest o stars , and there is essentially no emission below 228  , corresponding to the ionization energy of he@xmath31 .",
    "the appearance of w - r stars during the period 35 myr after the burst results in a dramatic change in the uv continuum , as these stars emit strongly in the he@xmath32 continuum below 228  . from 6 myr onwards ,",
    "the w - r stars disappear and the uv continuum rapidly fades and softens as the burst ages . only the models with an upper mass limit of @xmath33  = 100@xmath34",
    "generate the hard , w - r - dominated uv continuum ; the model sequences with @xmath33  = 30@xmath34  do not generate significant numbers of photons below 228   for any ages because the progenitors of w - r stars are not present in the initial burst .",
    "constant star - formation rate models with @xmath33  = 100@xmath34  form w - r stars continuously after 3 myr , but the overall shape of the uv continuum is softer than in the instantaneous burst models , because of the continuous formation of luminous o stars .    these results provide a useful starting point for the photoionization calculations .",
    "if it is possible for the region surrounding a young cluster to resemble a liner or transition object , then this is most likely to occur when the ionizing continuum is hardest , when w - r stars are present during @xmath35 myr after a burst .",
    "very massive stars ( in the range 30100 @xmath34  or greater ) must be present in the burst or else the requisite w - r stars will not appear .",
    "the formation of w - r stars is enhanced at high metallicity , so the ability to generate a liner or transition - type spectrum may be a strong function of metal abundance as well as age .      to create grids of photoionization models , we fed the uv continua generated by the starburst99  models into the photoionization code cloudy ( version 90.04 ; * ? ? ?",
    "for each time step , a grid of models was calculated by varying the nebular density and the ionization parameter , which is defined as the ratio of ionizing photon density to the gas density at the ionized face of a cloud .",
    "real liners and transition nuclei are likely to contain clouds with a range of values of density and ionization parameter , and more general models incorporating density and ionization stratification can be constructed as linear combinations of these simple single - zone models .",
    "all models were run with the following range of parameters : burst age from 1 to 10 myr at increments of 1 myr , with log @xmath36 ranging from @xmath37 to @xmath38 at increments of 0.5 , and a constant density ranging from log ( @xmath39/@xmath2 ) = 2 to 6 at increments of 1 . as a starting point",
    ", we computed a grid for an instantaneous burst with an imf having a power - law slope of @xmath40 , @xmath33  = 100 @xmath34 , solar metallicity in stars and gas , and a single plane - parallel slab of gas with no dust ; we will refer to this as model grid a. the solar abundance set was taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other grids were computed as variations on this basic parameter set , with the following modifications made in different model runs : a constant star - formation rate ; metallicity 0.2 , 0.4 , or 2@xmath41  in both stars and gas ; and spherical geometry for the nebula . to assess the effects of the highest - mass stars ,",
    "we also ran custom model grids , via the starburst99web site , with @xmath42 and 120 @xmath34 .    the depletion of heavy elements onto grains can result in marked changes to the emergent emission - line spectrum of an region , both by removing gas - phase coolants from the nebula and by grain absorption of ionizing photons , which will modify the effective shape of the ionizing continuum . in metal - rich regions",
    ", these effects will tend to boost the strengths of the low - ionization emission lines relative to the dust - free case @xcite . to assess the effects of dust in transition nuclei",
    ", we calculated additional model grids which included dust grains with a galactic ism dust - to - gas ratio along with the corresponding gas - phase depletions .",
    "the dusty models were all calculated using the solar abundance set for the undepleted gas .",
    "dust grains were assumed to have the optical properties of galactic ism grains , as described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . from the cloudy output files , we tabulated the strengths relative to h@xmath6  of the major emission lines which are prominent in liners .",
    "the calculations were performed under the assumption that the region is ionization bounded .",
    "for this case , the outer extension of the cloud was set to be the radius at which @xmath43 falls to 4000 k , beyond which essentially no emission is generated in the optical or uv lines . as a test , we ran a grid of models with the stopping temperature set to 1000 k , and we verified that the emission - line ratios were essentially identical to the default case of 4000 k stopping temperature .",
    "we also verified that the important diagnostic line ratios differed by @xmath44 dex between the spherical and plane - parallel cases when all other input parameters were unmodified , and all results discussed in this paper refer to the plane - parallel models . in the calculations ,",
    "the longest timescales for atomic species to reach equilibrium were of order @xmath45 years , much shorter than the evolution timescale of the stellar cluster , justifying the assumption that each time step of the cluster evolution could be used independently to calculate the nebular conditions .",
    "table [ table1 ] gives a summary of the model parameters , for the model grids which appear in the following discussion .",
    "the model results are displayed in figures [ oratio][ohimetal ] . to compare the model outputs with the observed properties of a variety of galaxy types , we have used the emission - line data compiled by @xcite .",
    "this catalog has the advantages of a homogeneous classification system , small measurement aperture ( @xmath46 ) , and careful starlight subtraction to ensure accurate emission - line data . in order to reduce confusion and to keep the sample of comparison objects to a reasonable number",
    ", we included only objects with unambiguous classifications as , liner , transition , or seyfert .",
    "objects with borderline or ambiguous classifications , such as `` liner / seyfert , '' were excluded for clarity .",
    "the comparison sample was further reduced by excluding galaxies in which any of the emission lines h@xmath9 , h@xmath6 , [ ] @xmath35007 , [ ] @xmath36300 , [ ] @xmath36583 , or [ ] @xmath3@xmath36716,6731 was undetected or was flagged as having a large uncertainty in flux ( `` b '' or `` c '' quality flags ) .",
    "the measured line ratios are corrected for both galactic and internal reddening .",
    "figure [ oratio ] plots the ratio [ ] @xmath35007/h@xmath6against [ ] @xmath36300/h@xmath9  at a burst age of 4 myr , for the solar - metallicity model grids a , b , c , and d. the model results are plotted for a density of @xmath47 @xmath2 , as an approximate match to the density of @xmath48 @xmath2  measured for ngc 4569 @xcite .",
    "the diagram shows that the instantaneous burst models ( a and b ) are a good match to the line ratios of the transition nuclei , for log @xmath49 . the dusty models from grid b fall more centrally within the region defined to contain transition objects , but the models without dust still closely match transition nuclei having lower [ ] @xmath36300/h@xmath9  ratios .",

    "we find that the single - burst models span the region occupied by transition nuclei in the diagnostic diagrams .    in the constant star - formation rate models ( c and d ) , the uv continuum remains softer than in the w - r - dominated phase of the instantaneous burst models , because of the ongoing formation of luminous o stars . as a result , the low - ionization emission lines are significantly weaker than in the instantaneous burst models at 4 myr .",
    "these constant star - formation rate sequences are a reasonable match to the region of nuclei in the diagram , and for [ ] /h@xmath9and [ ] /h@xmath9  the agreement with nuclei is improved at lower densities of @xmath50 @xmath2 , a value more typical of nuclei .",
    "these constant star - formation rate models are probably appropriate for galaxies having spatially extended , ongoing star formation in their nuclei .",
    "we note that the model curves shown in the figures should not be expected to follow the locus of nuclei in each plot , despite the fact that the models are generated with a starburst continuum .",
    "the range of line ratios observed in regions is primarily a sequence in metal abundance @xcite , while our models are shown as sequences in @xmath36 for a given metallicity and density .",
    "another point to note about the diagrams is that some of the transition galaxies fall outside the region nominally defined for transition objects , particularly in the [ ] /h@xmath9  ratio ( figure [ oratio ] ) .",
    "these galaxies were classified as transition objects by @xcite on the basis of meeting the majority of the classification criteria .",
    "similarly , some overlap can be seen in the diagrams between the regions occupied by liners and seyfert nuclei ; this again reflects the fact that galaxies span a continuous range in the values of these emission - line ratios .",
    "the variation of [ ] line strength as a function of density is shown in figure [ odensity ] for model grid a at @xmath51 myr .",
    "for the range of densities considered ( @xmath52 to @xmath53 @xmath2 ) , the models closely overlap the transition region in the diagram at log @xmath49 . introducing ism depletion and dust grains to the nebula primarily increases the [ ] /h@xmath9  ratio at low density .",
    "as expected , the [ ] /h@xmath9  ratio increases with @xmath39  up to densities of @xmath54 @xmath2 , while at densities approaching the critical density of the @xmath36300 transition ( @xmath55 @xmath2 ) this ratio saturates and begins to turn over .",
    "figure [ oage ] shows the [ ] /h@xmath9  ratio as a function of burst age ( at @xmath56 @xmath2 ) for model grid a , for ages of 2 to 6 myr .",
    "this diagram highlights the dramatic changes that w - r stars generate in the surrounding nebula . from 3 to 5 myr after the burst , when w - r stars dominate the uv continuum , the harder ionizing continuum boosts the strength of [ ] by an order of magnitude and the model sequences appear adjacent to the transition region , with relatively little evolution in the line ratios during this period . as the burst ages beyond 6 myr , the [ ] /h@xmath9  ratio continues to fall , and the emission - line strengths drop rapidly as the ionizing continuum softens and its luminosity decreases . at @xmath57 ,",
    "the wr - dominated phase occurs slightly later , during time steps 4 , 5 , and 6 myr .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath9  and [ ] /h@xmath9  ratios have a similar dependence on burst age , and are displayed in figures [ nage ] and [ sage ] , respectively ; these results are quite similar to the calculations presented by @xcite to illustrate the effects of the w - r continuum on the [ ] /h@xmath9  ratio . while the [ ] /h@xmath9  ratios in the models at @xmath58 are too low by @xmath59 dex to fit within the nominal transition region , they still closely match those transition nuclei having relatively low values for [ ] /h@xmath9 , and the low - ionization line strengths can be further enhanced by the inclusion of dust and depletion ( as in figure [ oratio ] ) .",
    "one puzzling aspect of figure [ oage ] is that for ages outside the range 35 myr , the models predict [ ] /h@xmath9  ratios too low to match the majority of nuclei .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss this same problem in the context of low - metallicity starburst galaxies .",
    "they propose that shocks generated by supernovae and stellar winds provide the additional [ ] emission , without making a significant contribution to the [ ] or [ ] line strengths .",
    "shocks could play a similar role in transition galaxies , as in the model of @xcite , although the lack of high - excitation uv line emission in transition nuclei is problematic for the shock hypothesis .",

    "although our results suggest that transition galaxy spectra may be attributed to a starburst with a high w - r / o - star ratio , the demographics of transition nuclei and nuclei indicate that many transition galaxies are probably not formed by this mechanism . in the starburst99  models ,",
    "the w - r - dominated phase in an instantaneous burst lasts for @xmath80 myr ( i.e. , 3 time steps in the calculations ) .",
    "an region surrounding an instantaneous burst will be visible for @xmath81 myr , after which the emission lines will fade rapidly ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , for an instantaneous burst population , the transition phase and the nucleus phase will have approximately equal lifetimes . if all nuclei consisted of instantaneous burst stellar populations with nebular conditions conducive to the formation of transition - type spectra , then nuclei and transition nuclei should be roughly equal in number .",
    "in reality , it is likely that a large fraction of star - forming nuclei contain multiple bursts of star formation and/or conditions of low density or low metallicity , so all star - forming nuclei should not be expected to evolve through a transition - type phase .",
    "although it is difficult to make specific predictions , it is probably safe to conclude that for a given hubble type , transition nuclei generated solely by starbursts should be considerably less numerous than ordinary nuclei .",
    "the statistics compiled by @xcite provide a basis for comparison .",
    "in early - type galaxies ( e and s0 ) , transition nuclei outnumber nuclei by a 3-to-1 margin . only for hubble types",
    "sb and later do nuclei begin to outnumber transition nuclei by a factor of 2 or more .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of this trend is that in early - type host galaxies , the majority of transition nuclei are actually agn/ region composites , as proposed by @xcite and others . at intermediate and late hubble types ,",
    "the population of transition nuclei may consist of both composite objects and `` pure '' starbursts evolving through the w - r - dominated phase .",
    "the presence of transition nuclei in a small fraction ( @xmath82 ) of elliptical galaxies @xcite presents a particularly intriguing problem . the ho et al .  survey detected five transition nuclei in ellipticals but not a single case of an elliptical galaxy hosting an nucleus .",
    "given that the models which have been considered for transition nuclei involve star formation , either alone or in combination with an agn , this observation is rather puzzling .",
    "perhaps faint agns in elliptical nuclei can produce transition - type spectra without substantial star formation activity .",
    "four of the five transition nuclei found in ellipticals by @xcite have borderline or ambiguous spectroscopic classifications , however , so `` pure '' transition nuclei in ellipticals are evidently quite rare .",
    "given these results , one might expect to see transition - type emission spectra in some fraction of disk regions in spiral galaxies , but in fact such spectra are never found .",
    "single - burst models for disk region spectra are only compatible with observed line ratios for model ages of @xmath70 myr @xcite , as the harder ionizing spectrum after 3 myr makes the models overpredict the strengths of the low - ionization lines .",
    "bresolin et al .  suggest that either current stellar evolution models are at fault , or that disk regions are disrupted before reaching an age of 3 myr , in which case the w - r phase would not be observed in the nebular gas .",
    "an alternate ( and perhaps more attractive ) possibility is that the majority of nuclei , as well as disk regions , are better described by the models with constant star - formation rate , or contain multiple bursts of star formation with an age spread of a few myr , which would result in a spectrum similar to the constant star - formation rate models .    for understanding the physical nature of transition objects ,",
    "the observational challenge is to search for any unambiguous signs of nonstellar activity .",
    "detection of broad h@xmath9  emission , or a compact source of hard x - ray emission with a power - law spectrum , would provide evidence for an agn component .",
    "high - resolution optical spectra ( from _ hst _ ) could provide a means to spatially resolve a central agn - dominated narrow - line region from the surrounding starburst - dominated component . since direct evidence for accretion - powered nuclear activity in transition nuclei is generally lacking",
    ", it should not be assumed that any given transition object actually contains an agn unless observations specifically support that interpretation .    one further effect that should be considered in starburst models in the future is photoionization by the x - rays generated by the starburst .",
    "x - ray binaries and supernova remnants will provide high - energy ionizing photons , resulting in a spatially extended source of soft x - ray emission as observed in the nucleus of ngc 4569 @xcite , for example .",
    "( the massive main sequence stars will contribute only a negligible amount to the total x - ray luminosity of a starburst ; see helfand & moran 1999 . )",
    "photoionization by x - rays will naturally lead to an enhancement of the low - ionization forbidden lines , and this could contribute to the excitation of some transition galaxies .",
    "the strength of [ ] @xmath36300 is the key distinguishing factor between liners and transition nuclei , and matching the observed strength of this line is the major challenge of starburst models for liners .",
    "our calculations show that liner spectra can only be generated by the starburst99  clusters under a very specific and limited range of circumstances .",
    "model grids a and b , while matching the [ ] / h@xmath9  ratio of transition nuclei quite well , do not overlap at all with the main cluster of liners in figure [ oratio ] , even at high densities and even when depletion and dust grains are included .",
    "only grid g with @xmath57 is able to replicate the high [ ] / h@xmath9  ratios of most liners , and only during @xmath83 46 myr and at densities of @xmath39  @xmath84 @xmath2 . in agreement with previous models",
    ", we find that values of log @xmath85 @xmath86 to @xmath87 reproduce the observed [ ] / h@xmath9ratios of liners .",
    "however , at such high densities the models underpredict the strengths of [ ] and [ ] relative to h@xmath9 .",

    "observations of near - infrared emission indicate the presence of clouds having @xmath94 @xmath2  in the galactic center region @xcite , so it is plausible that other galactic nuclei may contain ionized gas at similarly high densities even in the absence of an observable agn . a starburst origin for some liner 2 nuclei would provide a natural explanation for the lower values of the x - ray / h@xmath9  flux ratio seen in these objects , in comparison with agn - like liner 1 nuclei @xcite .",
    "it seems unlikely , however , that many liners are generated by this starburst mechanism . about 15% of liners",
    "are known to have a broad component of the h@xmath9  emission line , indicating a probable agn @xcite . by analogy with the seyfert population ,",
    "a much larger fraction of liners is likely to have broad - line regions which are either obscured along our line of sight , or are simply too faint to be detected in ground - based spectra against a bright background of starlight .",
    "many liners show signs of nuclear activity that can not be explained by stellar processes : compact flat - spectrum radio sources or jets , compact x - ray sources with hard power - law spectra , or double - peaked broad balmer - line emission , for example . as an increasing body of observational",
    "work supports the idea that many liners are in fact agns , there is less incentive to consider purely stellar models for their excitation .",
    "demographic arguments , similar to those given above for transition nuclei , can be applied for the liner population .",
    "since the liner phase only occurs for instantaneous bursts at high density and high metallicity , the starburst scenario implies that nuclei should be considerably more numerous than starburst - generated liners for a given hubble type .",
    "while liners are common in early - type hosts , nuclei are not found in elliptical hosts and are seen in fewer than 10% of s0 galaxies",
    "this disparity is a strong argument against a starburst origin for those liners in early - type galaxies . in",
    "later hubble types the situation is less clear , however .",
    "nuclei occur in @xmath95 of spirals of type sc and later , while liners occur in just 5% of these galaxy types @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that some of the liners in intermediate to late - type hosts could have a starburst origin , and this issue could be resolved by further uv and x - ray observations in the future .",
    "interestingly , the ho et al .  survey did not find any examples of broad h@xmath9  emission in liners or transition objects with hosts of type sc or later ; perhaps star formation plays a more prominent role than accretion - powered activity in these objects .",
    "while a few liners show spectral features of young stars in the uv @xcite , the quality of the observational data is poor in comparison with the ngc 4569 uv spectrum , and it is difficult to set meaningful constraints on the age of the young stellar population .",
    "ngc 404 is a possible candidate for a starburst - generated liner , but in its uv spectrum the p cygni features are weak in comparison with ngc 4569 , indicating either an older burst population or dilution by a featureless agn continuum @xcite .",
    "the liners having uv spectral features from massive stars may also host obscured agns which can be detected in other wavebands .",
    "for example , the uv continuum of the liner ngc 6500 appears to have its origin in hot stars @xcite , but observations of a parsec - scale radio jet unambiguously demonstrate that nonstellar activity is occurring as well @xcite .",
    "the starburst models presented here run into two obvious problems .",
    "first , w - r galaxies are almost never known to have liner or transition - type spectra .",
    "second , liners and transition nuclei almost never show w - r features in their spectra .",
    "is there any way to reconcile the starburst models with these facts ?",
    "w - r galaxies are identified by the appearance of the 4650   blend in their spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the formation of w - r stars is enhanced at high @xmath63 , the strength of this feature relative to h@xmath6  increases dramatically with metallicity , from @xmath44 at @xmath96 to @xmath97 at @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "however , in the nuclei of early - type spirals where high metallicities are expected , a nuclear starburst will be surrounded by the old stellar population of the galactic bulge , making the detection of the w - r bump extremely difficult @xcite .",
    "most of the currently known w - r galaxies are late - type spirals or irregular galaxies @xcite in which the w - r bump is visible against the nearly featureless starburst continuum . when the w - r bump is detected in galaxies , its amplitude above the continuum level is generally far smaller than that of h@xmath6  or even h@xmath99(e.g .",
    ". in most of the liner and transition galaxy spectra in the catalog of @xcite , however , h@xmath6  barely appears and h@xmath99  is too weak to be visible at all prior to continuum subtraction . even in a high - metallicity environment , where the total intensity of the w - r bump can be comparable to that of h@xmath6 , the amplitude of the w - r bump above the continuum will be much lower than that of h@xmath6  because the flux in the w - r feature is spread over @xmath100  .",
    "thus , the detection of w - r emission in galactic nuclei is strongly biased toward late - type , bulgeless galaxies . in late - type or dwarf irregular galaxies where the w - r bump is visible",
    ", the w - r / o - star ratio is expected to be much smaller owing to the lower metallicity , and the resulting softer ionizing spectrum will tend to produce an region spectrum rather than a transition object . the gas density as a function of hubble type may play a role as well ; in a study of nuclei , @xcite find a weak trend toward lower nebular densities in later - type host galaxies .",
    "observational detection of w - r features in transition nuclei is perhaps the clearest test of the starburst models , if sufficiently sensitive observations can be obtained .",
    "the uv spectrum of ngc 4569 is consistent with an age of @xmath101 myr , an age at which w - r stars are expected to be present .",
    "previous optical spectra have not revealed the 4650   w - r bump in ngc 4569 , but further observations with high s / n and small apertures would be worthwhile .",
    "the lack of @xmath31640 emission in the uv spectrum of ngc 4569 is potentially a more serious problem since the burst population should dominate at short wavelengths .",
    "the models of @xcite predict an equivalent width of at least 2   in the w - r - generated @xmath31640 line during the period 36 myr for an instantaneous burst of solar or higher metallicity , while the observed upper limit of @xmath102 erg s@xmath24  @xmath30  @xcite corresponds to an equivalent width limit of @xmath103  .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the @xmath31640 line lies at the extremely noisy blue end of the fos g190h grating setting , in a region where detection of emission or absorption features is difficult .",
    "two w - r galaxies may provide useful points of reference for the starburst models .",
    "ngc 3367 is classified by @xcite as an nucleus on the basis of its [ ] /h@xmath9  and [ ] /h@xmath9  ratios , although its [ ] /h@xmath9  ratio of 0.83 is more consistent with a liner or transition - type classification and its emission lines are markedly broader than those of typical nuclei .",
    "@xcite describe ngc 3367 as a starburst - dominated transition object ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the 4650   w - r bump was noted by @xcite , who also suggested a liner/ classification and a composite source of ionization .",
    "as a borderline nucleus / transition object with clear evidence for w - r stars , this object deserves further study , to determine whether there is indeed an agn or whether the enhanced low - ionization emission may be the result of ionization by the w - r population .",
    "the electron density of 835 @xmath2  measured from the [ ] doublet @xcite is also noteworthy , as this is among the highest densities found for an nucleus in the ho et al .  survey .",
    "another intriguing object is the nucleus of ngc 6764 , which has been classified variously as a seyfert , a liner , and a starburst by different authors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this galaxy exhibits prominent emission in the 4650   w - r blend @xcite .",
    "a recent study by @xcite demonstrates that the narrow emission lines are consistent with a liner classification , but there are no unambiguous signs of nonstellar activity in the nucleus .",
    "@xcite find that the nucleus contains @xmath104 w - r stars , and that the overall properties of the object are consistent with ionization by the starburst alone , rather than by a starburst / agn composite .",
    "if this conclusion is confirmed by further observations , ngc 6764 could be considered the best candidate for a liner photoionized by a starburst during its w - r - dominated phase .",
    "@xcite derived an age of 910 myr for the starburst in ngc 6764 based on near - infrared emission - line diagnostics , but this age is inconsistent with the presence of w - r stars , at least for the case of an instantaneous burst .",
    "compared with typical liners and transition nuclei , conditions for detection of w - r spectral features in these two objects are perhaps more favorable .",
    "both host galaxies are of late hubble types ( sbc for ngc 3367 and sbbc for ngc 6764 ) in comparison with the majority of liners and transition nuclei , so the level of contamination by the surrounding old stellar population is relatively low . furthermore ( and partly as a result of this ) , the emission - line equivalent widths in these two nuclei are relatively high for liners or transition nuclei . if the emission - line spectra of ngc 3367 or ngc 6764 had been superposed on a luminous early - type spiral bulge , the w - r emission might never have been noticed .",
    "the detection of w - r emission in a liner does not automatically imply a purely starburst origin for the emission lines , of course , since starbursts and agns are often known to coexist .",
    "mrk 477 is a well - known example of a seyfert 2 galaxy having a large population of w - r stars in its nucleus @xcite . in the context of the starburst model , however , the crucial test is to search for additional examples of liners or transition nuclei which exhibit a high ratio of w - r to o stars but no signs of accretion - powered activity .",
    "the most important limitation of these calculations comes from the accuracy of the input continua .",
    "the conclusion that the starburst models are able to reproduce transition or liner spectra under some circumstances depends crucially on the presence of w - r stars to provide a hard and luminous ionizing continuum . unfortunately , the continuum shape and luminosity of w - r stars in the extreme - uv band are quite uncertain , particularly in the he@xmath32 continuum where stellar winds have a dramatic effect .",
    "several up - to - date reviews of the numerous difficulties involved in modeling w - r spectra can be found in the volume edited by @xcite .",
    "the starburst99  model grid uses the w - r atmospheres of @xcite , which are calculated for a pure helium composition , but more recent atmosphere models are beginning to include the effects of line - blanketing , as well as clumping and departures from spherical symmetry . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the w - r / o - star ratio is also extremely model dependent , and may be revised in future generations of models .",
    "this would have a direct effect on the strength of the extreme - uv continuum and consequences for the nebular emission lines .",
    "furthermore , the starburst99  models neglect binary evolution , although this is more likely to affect the w - r / o ratio at low metallicity .",
    "since the results of the transition - object models are highly dependent on the most uncertain portion of the w - r spectrum , new photoionization calculations should be computed to assess the impact of different w - r evolution and atmosphere models in the future .",
    "the shape of the imf in starburst regions is a subject of some debate , and the possible variation of the imf with metallicity is of particular importance for galactic nuclei , which are likely to have @xmath105 . @xcite and @xcite suggested that @xmath33  should be lower in regions of higher metal abundance , but this issue has not been settled definitively .",
    "star - count observations demonstrate that the imf slope and @xmath33  do not appear to vary with metallicity @xcite , at least for @xmath106 .",

    "such a low value for @xmath33  would pose serious difficulties for any starburst models of liners and transition nuclei , as the massive progenitors of w - r stars would not be present . counterbalancing this trend",

    "<S> motivated by the discovery of young , massive stars in the nuclei of some liner/ `` transition '' nuclei such as ngc 4569 , we have computed photoionization models to determine whether some of these objects may be powered solely by young star clusters rather than by accretion - powered active nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the models were calculated with the photoionization code cloudy , using evolving starburst continua generated by the the starburst99  code of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the models are able to reproduce the emission - line spectra of transition nuclei , but only for instantaneous bursts of solar or higher metallicity , and only for ages of @xmath0 myr , the period when the extreme - ultraviolet continuum is dominated by emission from wolf - rayet stars . for clusters </S>",
    "<S> younger than 3 myr or older than 6 myr , and for models with a constant star - formation rate , the softer ionizing continuum results in an emission spectrum more typical of regions . </S>",
    "<S> this model predicts that wolf - rayet emission features should appear in the spectra of transition nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> while such features have not generally been detected to date , they could be revealed in observations having higher spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> demographic arguments suggest that this starburst model may not apply to the majority of transition nuclei , particularly those in early - type host galaxies , but it could account for some members of the transition class in hosts of type sa and later . </S>",
    "<S> the starburst models during the wolf - rayet - dominated phase can also reproduce the narrow - line spectra of some liners , but only under conditions of above - solar metallicity and only if high - density gas is present ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) . this scenario could be applicable to some `` type 2 '' liners which do not show any clear signs of nonstellar activity . </S>"
