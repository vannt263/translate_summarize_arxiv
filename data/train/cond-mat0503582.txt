    "nonequilibrium wetting can be modeled by a kpz growth process combined with a hard - core substrate that gives rise to an additional potential term in the kpz equation .",

    "for numerical studies of nonequilibrium wetting transitions we advocate the use of the single - step model because of its simplicity and efficency .    with large - scale simulations presented in this paper we have improved numerical estimates of the surface exponent @xmath0 .",
