    "understanding the chemical make - up of stars like the sun is fundamental to our understanding of star formation and stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite undertook a classical study of the chemical evolution of the galactic disc , deriving abundances for a sample of 189 nearby field f and g dwarfs .",
    "they found a number of interesting relationships in the data , for example , that the strongest age dependent abundance comes from ba , which they attribute to the efficient s - element synthesis in low - mass agb stars that enrich the interstellar medium long after star formation .",
    "they confirmed that metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 0.4dex ) are relatively overabundant in @xmath4-elements .",
    "since the [ @xmath4/fe ] for these stars shows a gradient that decreases with increasing galactocentric distance of the orbits , they show that star formation was probably more vigorous and started first in the inner parts of the galactic disc .",
    "since this work , various other samples have been studied , a number of which were performed by the exoplanet community ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these works have concentrated on studying the abundance distributions of exoplanet host stars compared with non - exoplanet hosts and a number of interesting trends have been found . along with the well established dependence of giant planet detection probability on host star metallicity @xcite",
    "these abundance analyses indicate that various other atomic abundances are likely enhanced in exoplanet hosts compared to non - exoplanet hosts ( e.g. si & ni ) , at least for the gas giant population .",
    "these over - abundances are explained in the framework of the core accretion scenario of planet formation @xcite where the more disc material present , the higher the probability of planet formation .    in general",
    ", the relative yields of different elements in the atmospheres of stars change with time , due to the processes of nucleosynthesis in the galaxy .",
    "these processes are still poorly known , yet performing high quality analyses of homogeneous stellar samples can shed light on the fine underlying processes that are occurring , following the formation of planetary systems .",
    "in recent years , series of large - scale abundance analyses have been published @xcite , mainly driven by the availability of high resolution spectral data from observational campaigns that are dedicated to searching for planets and the proliferation of software that allows us to automatically process the spectra of hundreds of stars in an automatic , or semi - automatic , manner .",
    "the analysis we provide here is used to determine the chemical abundances in the atmospheres of metal rich stars , along with their relative behaviour versus iron .",
    "it is worth noting that our sample is one of the generally homogeneous samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in comparison to similar studies , which cover up to a thousand stars , but obtained using different instruments with different resolutions and pipeline reduction techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , some homogeneous studies cover rather smaller number of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or with lower resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this work we combined both large enough sample and high resolution to provide us with a good statistical sample to investigate .",
    "the layout of the manuscript is as follows , in section [ _ observations ] we discuss the observational data , in section [ _ abundance_method ] we describe the method used to derive the abundances , and , our selection criteria of the examined lines , the influence of the microturbulence and rotation .",
    "section [ _ results ] contains the description of our results , and in section [ _ comparison ] we compare these results to the previously published works .",
    "finally , in section [ _ discussion ] we discuss the implication of our results in the field , and summarise our findings in section [ _ summary ] .",
    "the calan - hertfordshire extrasolar planet search ( cheps ) program @xcite is monitoring a sample of the metal rich stars in the southern hemisphere , to improve the statistics for planets orbiting such stars , along with searching for short period planets that have a high probability to transit their host star .",
    "all stars in the sample were initially selected from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue to have @xmath5-band magnitudes in the range 7.5 to 9.5 .",
    "this range ensures that the sample is not overlapping with existing planet search programs , since most solar - like stars with magnitudes below 7.5 are already being examined as part of other planet search programs , and the upper limit is set to ensure that the stars are bright enough to allow the best follow - up to search for secondary eclipses and transmission spectroscopy , essentially bridging the gap between the long - term precision radial velocity programs , and the fainter samples that photometric transit surveys are generally biased towards .",
    "more specifically , the cheps sample primarily contains objects that were drawn from a larger southern sample observed using the eso - feros spectrograph ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary selection of these targets was focused on the inactive ( log@xmath6 - 4.5dex ) and metal rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath00.1dex ) subset of this sample @xcite to ensure the most radial velocity stable targets , and to make use of the known increase in the fraction of planet - host stars with increasing metallicity , mentioned above .",
    "we note that , recent work has shown that the fraction of metal rich stars hosting low - mass planets may not follow the metallicity trend observed in the gas giant population @xcite .",
    "our subset of targets have been followed - up using the harps at la silla in chile . in our analysis , we use high s / n ( @xmath7100 ) and high - resolution spectra ( r@xmath8120,000 ) of predominantly single stars from the cheps sample that have been well characterised photometrically based on _ hipparcos _ data @xcite .    the general properties of the sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ _ figure_general_properties ] .",
    "@xcite carried out the photometric determinations of the surface gravity parameter for our stars ( shown with open circles ) , and we compare these values to our spectroscopically measured ( filled circles ) .",
    "we work within a narrow range between 5200 to 6200k , with the majority of our stars being metal rich and on the main sequence ( @xmath74.1 ) , although a few are slightly metal deficient ( [ fe / h]@xmath7 - 0.2 ) .",
    "most of the stars in our sample belong to the thin disc galactic population ; see the toomre diagram at the bottom right of fig .",
    "[ _ figure_general_properties ] .",
    "we used a modified numerical scheme developed by @xcite that allows to determine the atomic abundances , rotational velocities , microturbulences and surface gravities in the stellar atmospheres from high resolution and high s / n spectra , all in the framework of iterative approach , i.e. at each new step , the model atmospheres and synthetic spectra were recomputed for the metallicities and gravities derived before in our procedure , and for the fixed effective temperatures that were set photometrically .",
    "the method is based on the minimisation of differences in the profiles of computed and observed lines .",
    "we used the two independent procedures for the final model parameters .",
    "firstly , we required there to be no dependence of the fe abundance on the line strengths to obtain .",
    "secondly , we required the agreement between the abundances of fe and fe obtained for the previously found to determine .    for our starting point we used the photometrically determined metallicities and",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then we ran a few iterations to determine [ fe / h ] , , [ fe / h ] and .",
    "the final step was the determination of abundances and for the model atmosphere parameters found in the procedure before .",
    "all synthetic spectra were computed by the wita6 program @xcite using 1d local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) model atmospheres computed with sam12 code @xcite combined with the minimization routine abel8 @xcite .",
    "the lines to be fitted in the stellar spectra were compiled using the solar spectrum by @xcite and atomic line data from vald-2 and vald-3 @xcite .",
    "in our analysis we made a few basic assumptions : the level of activity is low in these atmospheres , in other words , the continuum in the optical range forms in the photosphere of the star .",
    "both the micro- and macroturbulent velocity fields are similar to the solar case . for simplicity",
    "we adopt that @xmath9 and do not change with the depth in these atmospheres .",
    "the convection zone is similar to the solar convection zone , even in the case of super metal rich stars .",
    "the minimum of the atmospheric temperature is located above the line formation region .",
    "spots on the surface of these stars are not sufficiently numerous to contribute to the formation of absorption lines or continuum , in terms of the emitted fluxes .",
    "naturally , if any of these assumptions is not valid for the physical state of the studied stars , we will obtain a spread of abundances and other determined parameters , even in the case of ideally determined and .",
    "the effective temperatures were estimated using the photometric methods ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , exploiting the existing large photometric databases , along with the latest relationships between stellar broad - band colours and their photospheric effective temperatures .",
    "namely , we used the johnson @xmath5-band photometry that was taken from the _ hipparcos _ database @xcite as our optical anchor point , and combined this with near - infrared photometry from the 2mass database @xcite , in particular the @xmath10-band magnitude that gives a sufficiently large wavelength baseline to sample the shape of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "we then used the relationships provided in @xcite to calculate accurate effective temperatures and place the stars on an hr - diagram to calculate the photometric values using the y2 evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "we choose to use these photometric for the computations , rather than update them spectroscopically .",
    "we believe this constrains uncertainties which may come from the quality of fits to the spectra and atomic line data , and these may also affect the results of our determination of abundances , microturbulent velocities , and surface gravities .",
    "we provide our analysis for the pre - selected list of spectral lines extracted from vald-2 and vald-3 @xcite . to create the list of reliable lines for each element , we computed the solar synthetic spectra and convolved them to get the effective resolving power of r@xmath870,000 , which is the effective resolution due to macroturbulent velocity field in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the theoretical spectra were fitted to the selected observed lines using the minimization routine abel8 . at this stage , we excluded severely blended lines , too weak lines with residual fluxes lower than 20 per cent and strong lines with @xmath110.7 to minimize the distortion of the results due to noise and possible nlte effects in the cores of the strong lines @xcite .",
    "we computed our synthetic spectra using the damping constants provided by vald @xcite . for the absorption lines without damping constants we computed them using the unsold formulas @xcite .",
    "the fitting part of each line profile was adopted manually to reduce the uncertainties introduced by wing blending . in some cases",
    ", very close blends of the lines of the same element were fitted together , resulting in a single spectral range to fit multiple lines . the final list of fitting ranges for the neutral and ionized atoms available on cds .",
    "the microturbulent velocity is an important parameter in 1d line - profile fitting techniques as there is an evident trend with abundances that causes uncertainties in their measurements .",
    "the dependence of fe and fe abundances on microturbulent velocity for hd 102196 is shown in fig .",
    "[ _ figure_method_microturbulence ] . here ,",
    "fe and fe abundances differ by up to @xmath10.1dex at @xmath121.0but the same at 1.4 .",
    "we carried out a set of synthetic spectra fits to fe and fe lines independently , using the grid of adopted microturbulent velocities in range from 0.0 to 2.6 , with a step of 0.2 .",
    "in fact , we followed the procedure of @xcite , but here we investigated the dependence of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the abundance and the central intensity of the corresponding iron absorption line computed for the grid of , the @xmath16 is known to show the dependence on .",
    "therefore , we determine our at @xmath16=0 .    our procedure is based on fitting to the line profiles , excluding the shallow parts of the wings , which could be more affected with blending by the weak lines of other elements .",
    "furthermore , the wings of lines are more affected by the pressure broadening than the microturbulent velocities .",
    "accounting both these factors should improve the determination of ( see fig .",
    "[ _ figure_microturbulence_comparison ] ) .",
    "the profiles of absorption lines in the stellar spectra affected by the rotation of a star , depending on the magnitude of rotation .",
    "the rotational profile , in our case , determined by the formula of @xcite , is of a different shape compared to the instrumental broadening and macroturbulence . in our analysis ,",
    "each line of the synthetic spectra was convolved with a profile of a different , and was fitted to the observed spectra until the best result was found .",
    "despite we used only fe lines for the determination of , the procedure was also applied for every other line of all our elements to get a better fit to the observed line profiles .",
    "we found that the majority of our stars are slow rotators , with @xmath34(fig . [ _ figure_rotation ] ) .",
    "likely , a few stars with larger rotational velocity present the cases where sin@xmath171 , rather than large @xmath18 itself , since these stars are of lower activities , with only a few fast rotating active stars left over .    on the other hand ,",
    "correlates with , older stars rotate slower , in agreement with the theory , and vice versa , which is in line with their ages given by the preliminary cheps selection .",
    "we can see an uprising trend of for the stars of lower , which represent a younger population .",
    "for the elements other than fe , was used rather as the adjusting parameter . nevertheless , it agreed for the properly fitted lines of different elements within an uncertainty of less than 1 .",
    "we can claim a clear measurement for the values of @xmath72 .",
    "uniform results for the iron lines give credibility to our results .",
    "we carried out a differential analysis with respect to the sun as a star , since our line lists were selected based on a comparison of the synthetic spectra to the observed solar spectrum by @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to minimize possible blending effects , at least in the solar case .",
    "we performed a quantitative analysis of the solar abundances to verify our procedure .",
    "computations were done for the initial model atmosphere with //[fe",
