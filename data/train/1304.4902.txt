    "the chlorosome is a light - harvesting antenna found in green sulfur and most of green non - sulfur bacteria . unlike the antenna complexes from other types of phototrophic bacteria , where the light - absorbing pigment bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) molecules are held by protein scaffolding , in the chlorosome bchls are self - aggregated in multiple supramolecular assemblies .",

    "the chlorosome is considered to be the largest and most efficient light - harvesting antenna systems found in nature  @xcite .",
    "this observation motivates a strong interest in the design of artificial light - harvesting systems that uses aggregates of pigment or dye molecules  @xcite .    in the light - harvesting complex ( lhc ) of green photosynthetic bacteria the light energy absorbed by the chlorosome is transferred through two consequent units ( the baseplate  @xcite and fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complexes  @xcite in green sulfur bacteria and the baseplate and b808-b866 complexes in green non - sulfur bacteria ) to reaction centers , where exciton dissociation occurs . unlike the chlorosome , which contains bchls @xmath0 , or @xmath1 depending on the species ,",
    "the other functional units of the lhc contain bchls @xmath2 embedded in a protein environment .",

    "et al_.  @xcite have proposed a structure of molecular aggregates composing the chlorosome from mutant @xmath5 @xmath4 bacteria , which synthesize bchl  @xmath6 chlorosomes .",
    "the bchls packing in these chlorosomes is more regular as compared to the wild type of bacteria , thus the intermolecular distance can be estimated with a higher accuracy . in order to reveal molecular alignment in bchl aggregates the authors utilized a solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance technique combined with cryo - em imaging .",
    "linear dichroism spectra of individual chlorosomes  @xcite confirm that the chlorosomes from the mutant bacteria are less disordered than those from the wild type .",
    "additionally , the aggregate structure proposed in  @xcite have been supported by two - dimensional polarization fluorescence microscopy experiments  @xcite .",
    "we utilize the aggregate model from  @xcite to calculate excitation dynamics and optical response of @xmath5 @xmath4 assuming that the structural dissimilarity between the mutant and the wild type of bacteria is small and its influence on eet within the chlorosome is negligible . in the model of ganapathy _",

    "we characterized the eet by combining all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) excited - state calculations , and open quantum system approaches . in this paper , we revise the excitation structure model in order to obtain more reliable optical and transport properties . to the sake of consistency we provide a detailed discussion of the model .",

    "our simulations allow for a unified description of the coherent and incoherent energy transfer and depict the overall time evolution of eet processes in the chlorosome .",

    "has also yielded four time measurements of 120 fs , 1.1 - 1.2 ps , 12 - 14 ps , and 46 - 52 ps  @xcite , while the authors have regarded all time components as the eet within bchl @xmath0 aggregates .",

    "here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the kinetic energy and the ground - state potential energy for the nuclear coordinates , respectively . as the next step ,",

    "the time dependence of the site energies @xmath13 comes from the dependence of their coordinates @xmath14 on time @xmath27 .",
    "this dynamic disorder arising from the nuclear motions is determined by the atomistic simulations .",
    "we use md simulations to generate @xmath28 and tddft excited - state calculations to obtain @xmath29 , which is consistent with the models proposed previously  @xcite thus , in contrast to many studies based on a quantum master equation , this approach can describe the system - bath coupling in complete atomistic detail .",
    "in addition to the dynamic disorder , there is another disorder among excitation energies of the bchls which does not change on the time scales of the exciton dynamics .",
    "the physical origins of this static disorder are due to the existence of different homologues of the bchls  @xcite , structural imperfections of supramolecular arrangements , and variations among individual chlorosomes .",
    "experimentally , the disorder among individual chlorosomes is estimated from low temperature spectral hole burning  @xcite and single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to predict this static disorder from md simulations .",
    "thus we account for the static disorder by introducing random shifts in the average site energy from a gaussian distribution @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the standard deviation for the static disorder .",
    "the @xmath31 is assumed to be identical for all bchls .",

    "it is computationally unfeasible to calculate site energies of all pigment molecules along an md trajectory . here , we take an approximate approach to obtain the site energy fluctuations by solving a set of langevin equations with white noise : @xmath37 where the stochastic force @xmath38 is determined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "one possibility is that the modifications stabilize formation of larger bchl aggregates which can be assembled into a large chlorosome containing a greater number of bchl @xmath0 .",
    "another possibility is that the modifications increase disorder in the aggregates and allow a much higher packing density of bchl @xmath0 in the chlorosomes without causing crystallizations .",
    "our theoretical calculations show that the peak position of the absorption maximum becomes red - shifted as the static disorder increases .",
    "this tendency agrees with the experimental observations .",

    "in contrast , methylation of bchl molecules will have an influence on both site energies and excitonic couplings by distorting the supramolecular arrangements .",

    "the coherences increase and decay within 40 - 50 fs ; these values give an estimate of a decoherence time .",
    "the results suggest that the exciton is coherently delocalized within 40 - 50 fs after the initial excitation of a localized state on a single site , and the coherent propagation is quickly damped due to the dynamic disorder .    in figure 7",
    ", we show the population and coherence dynamics among the roll at selected times . by comparing figures 7a and 7b",
    ", the coherences spread and are suppressed more rapidly than the populations , while transport directions are the same .",
    "these features are qualitatively similar for all examined values of the static disorder .",
    "the results show that the most of the excitation is distributed over neighboring bchls during the 100 fs after initial excitation , which is comparable to the sub-100 fs exciton diffusion model recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to quantify exciton transport on a timescale longer than the decoherence time we compute second moments of the site populations as a function of time .",

    "both components of the second moment initially scale quadratically and then linearly in time .",

    "the hsr is different from the classical hopping model only within the first 30  fs that correspond to the ballistic exciton propagation .",
    "in contrast , the ka model gives a sufficiently faster spread of exciton population over the roll .",
    "this effect can be attributed to the non - zero memory of the bath fluctuations as we discussed it in section ii .",
    "the mechanism by which the memory effects enhance the diffusion can be explained by considering site - to - site hopping rates .",
    "the hopping rate is determined by the overlap between donor fluorescence and acceptor absorption spectra .",
    "if the correlation function of the site energy is a delta function ( hsr model ) , absorption and fluorescence lineshapes become lorentzian so that the franck - condon factor is an overlap of two lorentz functions ( eq  [ eqn : lorentz ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the correlation function is exponential like the kubo - anderson model , lineshapes are closer to the gaussian  @xcite .",
    "it follows that the ka model gives larger overlap between the donor absorption and the acceptor fluorescence spectra .",
    "therefore , the memory effects of the bath fluctuations give larger hopping rates between pigments and thus lead to the larger exciton diffusion .",
    "note that the memory effects is more pronounced if the bath correlation time is larger than the present value as suggested from the experimental study  @xcite .",
    "finally , we investigate the dependence of the exciton diffusion on the static disorder .",
    "diffusion coefficients in the circumference and coaxial directions were calculated as a function of @xmath31 and are shown in figure 9 .",
    "the hsr model gives almost the same diffusion constants as the hopping model : the difference is only in the initial ballistic propagation up to around 30 fs .",
    "the ka models gives about twice as large diffusion coefficients as those from the hsr without the static disorder , while the memory effects become small with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "the time when an exciton arrives at the opposite site of the roll from the initial site excitation can be used as the time scale of exciton equilibration over the single - layer roll , where the exciton populations are equal for all sites .",
    "this time can be calculated as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the radius of the roll . for the roll of radius @xmath80  nm ( 60 bchl molecules per a ring ) with the static disorder of 300 @xmath59",
    "we obtain the equilibration time to be 8.1  ps .",
    "so far we have focused on the single - layer roll , yet chlorosomes may consist of several multi - layer rolls as suggested from em images  @xcite . here",
    "we explore the eet among different layers and rolls .",
    "we set up two - concentric ten - stacked ( 2x10 ) rings and two - roll system consist of 2x10 rings for analysis of the inter - layer and inter - roll eet .",
    "rings from the inner and outer layers consist of 60 and 80 bchls , respectively .",
    "their structures and initial conditions for exciton dynamics are shown in figure 10b and 11b . in order to speed up our quantum dynamics simulations ,",
    "we have developed a code for large systems which can propagate wavefunctions in parallel .",
    "the simulation conditions are same as those in the earlier sections , and exciton populations were obtained with @xmath31 = 300 @xmath59 .",
    "figure 10a shows the populations of the inner and outer layers in the 2x10 rings .",
    "the single exponential fitting of the inner population yields the time constant of 1.1 ps , and double exponential fitting does not improve the fit .",
    "the time of the inter - layer eet is faster than that of the exciton equilibration within the layer .",
    "the time scale of exciton equilibration over the outer layer can be estimated as 14.4 ps by taking into account the diameter of the outer layer .",
    "the result suggests that for a localized initial excitation the exciton is first distributed among different layers with the characteristic time of 1.1 ps and then equilibrated over the roll in 8.1 - 14.4 ps , respectively for the inner and outer rolls .",
    "figure 11a shows the population dynamics between the two double rolls .",
    "exponential fitting for the population of the left roll gives two time constants of 1.4 ps ( 26% ) and 69.8 ps ( 76% ) .",
    "the faster time component of 1.4 ps is compared to that of inter - layer transfer and thus describes the energy transfer between outer layers of the left and right rolls . because of the small contact between the rolls , the inter - roll energy transfer becomes slower after the exciton diffuses over the left roll .",
    "the inter - roll eet transfer occurs on major time scale of 69.8 ps , which is much larger than the exciton equilibration over the single roll .",
    "note that the two - roll system is an extreme structure . in chlorosomes ,",
    "a roll may be surrounded by other rolls or lamellar layers  @xcite .",
    "thus , the estimated time constants 1.4 and 69.8  ps can be considered as the lower and the upper bounds of the inter - layer energy transfer time scale .",
    "= 300 @xmath59.,width=302 ]    transient anisotropy decay directly probes the orientational dynamics of transition dipole moments in a system consisting of multiple chromophores and has been used in the analysis of the lifetimes of coherent energy transfer and associated quantum coherence  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the fluorescence anisotropy decay based on the exciton dynamics . in the exciton propagation model",
    "we have added the ground state and the off - diagonal system - radiation hamiltonian , @xmath81 to eq  [ eqn : h_system ] . here",
    "@xmath82 is an electric field for an excitation pulse , and @xmath83 is a dipole moment operator .",
    "an ( @xmath74,@xmath84 ) component of polarization tensor @xmath85 is defined as the @xmath74-th component of the dipole moment after applying an electric field polarized in the @xmath84 direction .",
    "the anisotropy decay @xmath86 can be calculated as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are isotropic and anisotropic tensor invariants of polarization tensor , respectively  @xcite .",
    "an initial condition was chosen as the ground state @xmath90 , and an 8 fs gaussian - enveloped electric field of frequency 14890 @xmath59 was applied as the excitation pulse .",
    "we use the three - stacked rings to calculate the anisotropy decay .",
    "figure 12 shows the polarization anisotropy decay for the three - stacked rings structure .",
    "the initial value of the anisotropy is close to 0.8 , and the residual value is about 0.18 . the anisotropy shows the oscillatory behavior within 50 fs after the excitation pulse , reflecting wavelike motion of the exciton .",
    "single exponential fitting to the anisotropy profile yields 30 fs as the depolarization time .",
    "the depolarization time can be compared to the decoherence time estimated from the coherences in site basis in section iv c. note that the ultrafast depolarization time of sub-100 fs has not been resolved by earlier time - dependent polarization anisotropy experiments  @xcite .",
    "for example , the one - color ta anisotropy in the wavelength region of 720 - 790 nm has given a single decay time of 1.7 - 3.9 ps  @xcite .",
    "the lack of the ultrafast component in the earlier experiments is probably due to there limited time resolution .",
    "in this final section , we summarize the various time scales of eet obtained from our simulations .",
    "table ii shows the theoretical time scales in comparison with experimental time scales measured for chlorosomes from wild type of @xmath62 .",
    "it should be noticed that the eet time scales may be affected by the presence of the baseplate acting as an exciton drain , which lies outside the scope of this paper .",
    "exciton dynamics in the whole light - harvesting system , which is composed of the chlorosome , baseplate , and fmo complexes , is being studied in our group , which will be submitted elsewhere .",
    "the experimental studies  @xcite have suggested that there are four major time constants in the eet processes .",
    "here , we compare our results with the time components of 120 fs , 1.1 - 1.2 ps , 12 - 14 ps , and 46 - 52 ps which were obtained with 685 nm pump and 758 nm probe  @xcite , which should have a minimal contribution from the baseplate bchl @xmath2 .",
    "our simulations show the coherent propagation of excitons for the initial 50 fs after excitation .",
    "the lifetime of this coherent energy transfer can be estimated from the decoherence time and the depolarization time .",
    "the first component of 120 fs can be associated with the coherent eet which describes wavelike motions of the exciton .",
    "the depolarization times of 30 fs is smaller than the first component of the ta experiments .",
    "a possible reason for this is that in terms of the bloch equation interpretation , the time components of the ta experiments will describe the population decay ( @xmath91 ) time , while the depolarization time includes a pure dephasing time ( @xmath92 ) as well  @xcite .",
    "the incoherent eet subsequently takes places after the ultrafast process .",
    "we have obtained 1.1 ps for the inter - layer eet within a single roll and 1.4 ps for the energy transfer between neighboring layers of the double rolls .",
    "the time scale of 1.1 - 1.4 ps is in good agreement with the second time component of 1.1 - 1.2 ps ; the second component describes the inter - layer energy transfer .",
    "the 8.1 - 14.1 ps time is comparable to the third component of 12 - 14 ps , suggesting that the third component reflects the exciton equilibration within a single roll .",
    "the time constant of 69.8 ps corresponds qualitatively to the 46 - 52 ps .",
    "the forth time component is tentatively assigned as the exciton equilibration over different rolls , while this would not be the case if a roll were surrounded by lamellar layers .",
    "based on the interpretations above , we speculate on the corresponding time scales of the eet in the chlorosomes based on the structure from the three - point mutant .",
    "the first component describes the lifetime of the coherent energy transfer which largely depends on the exciton - vibration coupling .",
    "reorganization energies will be similar for the wild type and the three - point mutant as long as the local packing structure is the same .",
    "therefore , the first component reflecting the coherent energy transfer may be similar for the wild type and the three - point mutant .",
    "we also expect that the second component describing the inter - layer eet is similar for the wild type and the three - point mutant , because the same 2.1 nm spacing was observed for both the wild type and the three - point mutant  @xcite .",
    "the third component describing the energy equilibration over the roll is sensitive to a radius of the roll .",
    "the em study  @xcite finds that the diameter of the roll of the three - point mutant is larger than that of the wild type .",
    "according to our interpretation and the experimental observation , the third time component of the three - point mutant will be larger than that of the wild type .",
    "this could be an experimental verification of our assignment of the experimental time scales .",
    "the model introduced in section  ii utilizes several basic assumptions .",
    "firstly , eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : schrodinger ] ) and ( [ eqn : langevin ] ) are equivalent to the quantum langevin equation for the exciton wave function  @xcite written in a site basis .",
    "this equation is strictly applicable in a weak exciton - vibration coupling regime .",
    "however , for natural light - harvesting structures an intermediate strength interaction between the electronic excitations and the high - frequency bchl vibrational modes of the range of @xmath93  @xmath59 has been suggested  @xcite . in order to account for this effect polaron models",
    "have been proposed  @xcite . in general , a strong coupling between the exciton and vibrations renormalizes the exciton energy and also reduces its mobility . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors investigated the effects of polaron formation in absorption spectra of lhii of purple bacteria complexes , using a combined molecular dynamics / quantum chemistry approach .",
    "they found that the interaction of the excitation with the intramolecular vibrations at about @xmath94  @xmath59 can be described as a weakly coupled polaron .",
    "the estimated polaron binding energy was about a half of the exciton bandwidth . in the case of a chlorosome",
    "we expect this effect to be weaker .",
    "while the polaron binding energy should be about the same , the electronic excitation couplings between the molecules should be stronger due to about 30% closer packing of bchls .",
    "then , comparing the intermolecular couplings in lhii and the chlorosome within a same model one gets about three times stronger an intermolecular interaction in the latter case .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the red shift of the chlorosome and the lhii absorption lines as compared to the corresponding monomers .",
    "secondly , our classical phonon bath model accounts for dephasing processes only and no feedback of the system on the bath is included .",
    "thus , the long time population dynamics calculated within this model corresponds to an infinite temperature case .",
    "however , similar approaches based on classical phonon baths have been compared with reduced density matrix methods  @xcite , and they can yield reasonable results compared to exact calculations for a wide range of parameters .    finally , the supramolecular structure that we use corresponds to mutant bacteria . thus one can argue that it may be different from the structure of a chlorosome in wild type _ c. tepidum_. for instance in @xcite the authors suggested a different aggregation of bchl @xmath0 and bchl @xmath6 in green sulfur bacteria .",
    "we expect that the different aggregation can introduce additional corrections to the excitation dynamics that have to be studied in more details .",
    "in this work , we have characterized the eet in the chlorosome by combining md simulations , excited - state calculations with tddft , and stochastic propagation of an excitonic wave function .",
    "our study shows that the coherent energy transfer occurs for 50 fs after the initial excitation , and the wavelike motion of the exciton is damped to vanish in 100 fs due to the dynamic disorder .",
    "the incoherent energy transfer subsequently takes place in the characteristic time constants from 1 ps to several tens of ps .",
    "the existence of multiple time scales reflects a hierarchy of the structures in the chlorosomes .",
    "we have interpreted the experimental time scales in terms of the theoretical results and also presented a possible verification of our assignment .",
