    "numerical continuation of solutions to boundary value problems ( bvps ) has been used extensively to study periodic orbits and their bifurcations , including homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits , in a wide variety of systems . for a recent overview",
    "see the articles in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , these techniques have been applied to compute families of periodic orbits in the circular restricted 3-body problem ( cr3bp ) ; see , for example ,  @xcite . in recent years",
    "invariant manifolds such as those in the lorenz system have also been computed in detail using numerical continuation  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", continuation methods have been developed for computing and continuing homoclinic and heteroclinic connecting orbits between periodic orbits and equilibria or periodic orbits  @xcite . in the current work we use a combination of these techniques to illustrate their effectiveness in computing stable and unstable manifolds and connecting orbits in the cr3bp .",
    "there is much literature on invariant manifolds and connecting orbits in the cr3bp ; see for example @xcite",
    ". in particular , connecting orbits in the planar cr3bp are well understood .",
    "the existence of connecting orbits in the planar problem has been proved analytically in @xcite , and by computer assisted methods in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these orbits have been extensively studied numerically using initial - value techniques and semi - analytical tools ; see @xcite and references therein . in the case of initial - value techniques",
    "the initial conditions are varied in order for an appropriately chosen end point condition to be satisfied .",
    "this approach is commonly referred to as a `` shooting method '' and , for a more stable version , `` multiple shooting '' .",
    "initial - value techniques can also be very effective in the computation of invariant manifolds in the cr3bp .",
    "however , sensitive dependence on initial conditions may leave parts of the manifolds unexplored , unless very high accuracy is used .",
    "other efficient methods for computing invariant manifolds include semi - analytical approximations @xcite .",
    "the latter methods are very precise in a neighborhood of the center of expansion , and rely on other methods to extend the manifolds outside these neighborhoods @xcite .",
    "invariant manifold techniques around libration points have been used successfully in mission design @xcite .",
    "the genesis spacecraft mission , designed to collect samples of solar wind and return them to the earth @xcite , is often considered as the first mission to use invariant manifolds for its planning , while other missions have used libration point techniques @xcite . having a precise idea of",
    "the geometry of invariant manifolds and their connections is desirable in the design of complex low thrust missions .    using our continuation approach",
    "we construct a continuous solution family in the manifold as the initial value is allowed to vary along a given curve .",
    "the continuation step size governs the distance between any computed trajectory and the next trajectory to be computed .",
    "here `` distance '' includes the change in the entire trajectory , and not only in the initial conditions .",
    "in fact , this distance typically also includes other variables in the continuation process , such as the integration time and the arclength of the trajectory .",
    "this formulation allows the entire manifold to be covered , up to a prescribed length , integration time , or other termination criterion , even in very sensitive cases .",
    "special orbits , such as connecting orbits to saddle - type objects , can be detected during the continuation .",
    "for example , a straightforward computation of the lorenz manifold in this fashion yielded up to 512 connecting orbits having extremely close initial values , as reported in @xcite . in related work ,",
    "the intersections of the lorenz manifold with a sphere are studied in @xcite and @xcite . in the case of the lorenz manifold , the sensitivity on initial conditions results from the significant difference in magnitude of the two real negative eigenvalues of the zero equilibrium that give rise to this manifold .",
    "fixed precision integration in negative time may cover only part of this manifold , missing a portion in and near the direction of the eigenvector of the smaller negative eigenvalue .",
    "in this paper we give an overview of continuation techniques , as used to compute periodic orbits , invariant manifolds , and connecting orbits .",
    "we also give several examples that illustrate how these techniques provide an effective and relatively easy - to - use tool for exploring selected portions of phase space .",
    "the richness of the solution structure of the cr3bp limits the extent of our illustrations .",
    "however , the techniques presented here are expected to be useful in further studies . in this respect ,",
    "the current version of the freely available auto software @xcite includes demos that can be used to re - compute some of the numerical results presented here , including their graphical representation .",
    "these demos can also be adapted relatively easily to perform similar numerical studies of stable and unstable manifolds of other periodic orbits in the cr3bp that are not considered in this paper , as well as for entirely different applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cr3bp ] we recall some well - known facts about the cr3bp , namely , its equilibria , the libration points , and the basic periodic solution families that will be considered in this paper , namely the planar lyapunov orbits and the vertical , halo and axial families . in sect .",
    "[ sec : periodic - orbits ] we review how boundary value techniques are used to compute periodic orbits in conservative systems , and how these techniques can also be used to compute the eigenfunctions associated with selected floquet multipliers .",
    "these data provide a linear approximation of the unstable manifold of the periodic orbit .",
    "[ sec : manifold - algorithm ] describes the continuation method used for computing unstable manifolds of periodic orbits .",
    "this involves first setting up an extended system with both the periodic orbit and its eigenfunction . using the resulting information an initial orbit within the manifold is computed .",
    "this orbit is then continued , as its starting point is free to vary along a line that is tangent to a linear approximation of the unstable manifold , thereby tracing out the manifold .",
    "the algorithm , using pseudo - arclength continuation , is not guaranteed to compute the whole manifold in a single computation , because obstacles may be encountered during the continuation . in such cases the manifold",
    "may be completed , for example , by additional continuations from different starting orbits , or by using a suitably adapted continuation procedure as is done in @xcite .",
    "however , the obstacles themselves are also of interest .",
    "they may correspond to orbits in the unstable manifold that require an arbitrary long time interval to reach a specified termination plane , because they pass arbitrarily close to a connecting orbit between the original unstable periodic orbit and another invariant object . in this way",
    "connecting orbits can be detected , as was done to detect the 512 heteroclinic connections presented in @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : manifold - examples ] we show the results of computations of unstable manifolds of vertical @xmath0 and halo @xmath1 orbits .",
    "when the manifolds are computed to a sufficient distance from the original periodic orbit , we find what appear to be heteroclinic connecting orbits from the original periodic orbit to an invariant torus . the tori found this way must have saddle - type instability , since the connecting orbit approaches it , but ultimately also leaves the neighborhood of the torus .",
    "such connecting orbits may be more difficult to find with initial value integration .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : connecting - orbits ] we describe a method for continuing the periodic - orbit - to - torus connections as solutions of an @xmath2-dimensional ode , when the energy is allowed to vary .",
    "these computations lead to the detection of other interesting connecting orbits .",
    "[ sec : connecting - orbits - examples ] discusses three representative examples .",
    "first we consider a family of connections from @xmath1 halo orbits .",
    "these connections loop once around the earth before approaching an invariant torus , which is itself close to the @xmath1 orbit .",
    "we refer to such a torus as a quasi-@xmath1 torus . during the continuation , with",
    "changing energy of the originating @xmath1 halo orbit , we encounter a number of interesting connecting orbits .",
    "specifically , we find a homoclinic orbit from an @xmath1 halo orbit to itself that loops once around the earth , a heteroclinic connection from a northern @xmath1 halo orbit to its southern counterpart , a heteroclinic connection to a planar @xmath3 lyapunov orbit , and a connection to a 5:1 resonant orbit on a torus near the corresponding southern halo orbit .",
    "we also find a connecting orbit from an @xmath1 halo orbit to a torus on which the orbit bounces back and forth between a northern axial @xmath4 orbit and its southern counterpart .",
    "each of these special connecting orbits occurs for a specific energy of the originating @xmath1 halo orbit ( and of course , by conservation of energy , the orbit it connects to has the same energy ) .",
    "secondly we study a family of connecting orbits from an @xmath1 halo orbit that loop four times around the earth .",
    "we find connections to an @xmath5 lyapunov orbit , an @xmath6 halo orbit , and to a 5:1 and a 6:1 resonant torus near the libration point @xmath7 .",
    "thirdly , we consider a family of connecting orbits on the moon - side of the unstable manifold of the @xmath1 halo orbits that connect directly ( without looping around the earth ) to a torus near @xmath7 .",
    "we find an example of a direct connecting orbit from an @xmath1 halo orbit to a planar @xmath5 lyapunov orbit . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these connecting orbits have not been found before .",
    "we must stress , however , that from a space mission design point of view , these orbits are sensitive to initial conditions and would require control techniques to stay on them .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss global theoretical aspects of our results and their relation to the existing literature . in particular we see that the connecting orbits from @xmath1 halo orbits to @xmath4 axial orbits or to @xmath3 or @xmath5 planar lyapunov orbits are codimension - one in the dynamical systems sense , and hence should occur for specific values of the energy of the originating @xmath1 halo orbit , as we observed numerically .",
    "in contrast , homoclinic and heteroclinic connecting orbits between @xmath1 halo orbits , which were observed numerically , are codimension - two , and so should not normally occur .",
    "we show that the connecting orbits from the @xmath1 halo orbits to quasi-@xmath1 tori are generic , and suggest that the numerically observed homoclinic and heteroclinic connecting orbits between @xmath1 halo orbits are actually connections to quasi-@xmath1 tori where the minor radius of the torus is so small as to make the torus visibly ( and for the purpose of space mission design ) indistinguishable from the @xmath1 halo orbit that it envelopes .    finally in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerical - aspects ] we discuss some computational aspects of our numerical computations , such as the discretization used , and typical computer time needed .",
    "the cr3bp describes the motion of a satellite @xmath8 with negligible mass in three - dimensional physical space .",
    "the motion is governed by the gravitational attraction of two heavy bodies , which are assumed to rotate in circles around their common center of mass ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : r3bp](a ) . in this paper",
    "we call the heaviest body the `` earth '' @xmath9 , and the other heavy body the `` moon '' @xmath10 , and we use their actual mass ratio , namely , @xmath11 . any other mass ratio is allowed , such as for the sun - jupiter system , with a mass ratio of @xmath12 . without loss of generality",
    "the total mass can be scaled to @xmath13 , so that the earth and moon have mass @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the equations of motion of the cr3bp as given in  @xcite are @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the position of the zero - mass body , and where @xmath18 denote the distance from @xmath8 to the earth and to the moon , respectively .",
    "the cr3bp has one integral of motion , namely , the energy @xmath9 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the effective potential .",
    "astronomers also often use the _ jacobi constant _",
    "c , defined as @xmath21 .",
    "libration points , in both the planar and three - dimensional spatial system , are equilibrium points in a co - rotating frame ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : r3bp](b ) .",
    "as already used , we denote the libration points by @xmath22 , @xmath7 ,  @xmath23  , @xmath24 .",
    "there are families of periodic orbits ( in the co - rotating frame ) that bifurcate from each of these libration points , and we refer to these as the _ primary families_. many more families subsequently bifurcate from the primary families .",
    "we refer to the bifurcation points as _ branch points_. several families of periodic solutions of the earth - moon system are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : families ] ; see also @xcite and references therein . in the present work we focus on four families , namely , the vertical orbits @xmath25 , the planar lyapunov orbits @xmath26 , the halo orbits @xmath27 , and the axial orbits @xmath28 . the families of planar lyapunov orbits @xmath26 and the vertical orbits",
    "@xmath25 emanate directly from the libration points @xmath29 ; these are primary families ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l1v1 ] ) .",
    "the families of halo orbits bifurcate from the families of lyapunov orbits @xmath26 , while the families of axial orbits connect and bifurcate from the @xmath25 and @xmath26 families .",
    "we refer to the halo and axial orbits as _ secondary families _",
    "[ fig : h1a1 ] ) .",
    "these families are all well - documented in the literature , but their names are sometimes different .",
    "for example , the halo , axial , and vertical orbits are known as type `` a '' , `` b '' , and `` c '' , respectively , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite coined the name `` halo '' for that family .",
    "the term `` axial '' comes from @xcite , whereas @xcite used the term `` y '' for `` yellow '' .",
    "in this and the next section , we describe the algorithms used in the various stages of the computations in some detail , so that it will be possible for the reader to replicate the algorithms in other applications , and to better understand the functioning of the downloadable cr3bp demos @xcite .",
    "specifically , in this section we explain the preliminary computations that precede the actual computation of stable and unstable manifolds of periodic orbits , namely , the computation of the periodic orbits themselves and of their associated eigenfunctions .",
    "the discussion follows that in @xcite .    to formulate a suitable boundary value problem in auto , the second order system of odes first needs to be rewritten as a six - dimensional first order system , @xmath30 where @xmath31 . as usual , when we plot the orbits graphically we project into @xmath32 by only plotting the spatial coordinates @xmath17 .",
    "time is scaled to the interval @xmath33 $ ] in the bvp formulation for computing a periodic orbit , which changes the system of differential equations to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the period of the periodic orbit .",
    "in addition , for a conservative system with one conserved quantity , we need to add a term with an `` unfolding parameter '' in order for the bvp continuation computations to be formally well - posed @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "a suitable and convenient choice in the specific case of the cr3bp is the term @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "the vector field with the unfolding term then becomes @xmath38 which from here on we simply write as @xmath39 also omitting the mass - ratio parameter @xmath40 , as it is typically fixed in the computation of families of periodic orbits .",
    "notice that the specific choice of unfolding term @xmath41 used here would represent a damping ( or forcing ) term if @xmath42 , which would preclude the existence of periodic orbits .",
    "however , the unfolding parameter @xmath43 is one of the unknowns in the continuation procedure , and will always be zero ( to numerical precision ) once solved for .",
    "thus the unfolding term is simply a technical device necessary to obtain well - posedness of the bvp , and we do not force or damp the equations of motion .    written in full , the system is therefore given by @xmath44 + \\sigma v_x~,\\\\ \\dot v_y & = t~[-2 v_x + y - ( 1-\\mu ) y r_1^{-3 }                - \\mu y r_2^{-3 } ] + \\sigma v_y~,\\\\ \\dot v_z & = t~[-(1-\\mu)z{{r_1}^{-3 } } - \\mu z{{r_2}^{-3 } } ] + \\sigma v_z~. \\end{split } \\label{eq : writtenout}\\ ] ] to complete the bvp formulation we need to add the periodicity equations @xmath45 if @xmath46 solves eqs .",
    "and   then @xmath47 is also a solution for any time - translation @xmath48 . to specify a unique solution",
    "we impose the phase constraint @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the preceding computed solution along the solution family .",
    "furthermore , for the purpose of continuing a family of periodic solutions , we add keller s pseudo - arclength constraint @xcite , which in the current setting takes the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 corresponds to a computed solution along a solution family , @xmath53 is the next solution to be computed , and @xmath54 is the continuation step size .",
    "the notation `` @xmath55 '' denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath54 at @xmath56 and @xmath57 denotes the dot product .",
    "since we are dealing with a conservative system , we already have families of periodic solutions even when the mass - ratio @xmath40 is fixed . for a computed solution @xmath52 , and a given step @xmath54 , the unknowns to be solved for in any continuation step are the periodic orbit @xmath46 , its period @xmath35 , and the unfolding parameter @xmath43 .",
    ".  [ eq : pseudo ] forces all of these unknowns to be close to those of the previous solution .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 must be close to @xmath50 for _ all _ @xmath58 , and not just for @xmath59 .",
    "we reiterate that the unfolding parameter @xmath43 is an active unknown in the computations that regularizes the boundary value formulation , although it will be found to be zero to numerical precision . during the continuation",
    "the floquet multipliers of the periodic solution are monitored by computing a special decomposition of the monodromy matrix that arises as a by - product of the decomposition of the jacobian of the collocation system @xcite .    for the purpose of computing a stable or unstable manifold of a periodic orbit",
    "we need the corresponding floquet eigenfunction .",
    "specifically , we assume that the periodic orbit has a single , real , positive floquet multiplier outside the unit circle in the complex plane , which gives rise to a two - dimensional unstable manifold of the periodic orbit in phase space .",
    "the eigenfunction corresponding to this multiplier provides a linear approximation to the manifold close to the periodic orbit . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that this eigenfunction can be obtained as a solution @xmath60 of the bvp @xmath61 where @xmath62 in the case of a positive multiplier , and @xmath63 in the case of a negative multiplier . here",
    ", @xmath64 is the characteristic exponent and the corresponding floquet multiplier is given by @xmath65 .",
    ".   represents the floquet eigenfunction / eigenvalue relation for the linearization of eq .   about a periodic orbit @xmath46 .",
    "the norm of the value of the eigenfunction at time @xmath59 is normalized to be @xmath66 , where typically we use @xmath67 .",
    "if only one floquet multiplier is real and greater than one in absolute value , this gives a unique ( up to sign ) unstable eigenfunction @xmath60 .",
    "likewise , a unique stable eigenfunction is obtained if only one floquet multiplier is real and less than one in absolute value . in our illustrations",
    "we only compute unstable manifolds , so we have @xmath68 in eq .  ; however all algorithms apply equally well to stable manifolds .",
    "we also restrict to the case where the floquet multiplier of interest is positive , so @xmath62 in eq .  , and the corresponding manifold is orientable rather than twisted . a linear approximation of the unstable manifold at time zero is then given by @xmath69 for @xmath70 small .",
    "an alternative formulation is to put the actual floquet multiplier in the boundary condition rather than in the linearized differential equation , using the variational equation @xmath71 and boundary condition @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the actual floquet multiplier .",
    "however , the formulation in eq .  , as used here , has been found to be more appropriate for numerical purposes @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that the multipliers , _ i.e. _ , the values of @xmath74 , can be very large or very small .    the algorithmic steps that lead to the linear approximation of the unstable manifold are then as follows ; here described for the case of a halo orbit in the @xmath1 family .    1 .   the libration points , which are the equilibria of eq .",

    "[ fig : h1-to - h2-torus ] , [ fig : h1-to - h1-torus ] , [ fig : h1-to - h2-direct ] , and  [ fig : h1-poincare ] .",
    "we have mentioned that the center manifold of a libration point @xmath29 restricted to the energy surface is a three - dimensional nhim , so we can do a dimension counting analysis similar to those above .",
    "the main observation is that for a fixed value of the energy , these quasi - halo orbits are lower dimensional whiskered quasi - periodic solutions ( see @xcite ) that lie inside the three - dimensional center manifolds of the collinear libration points .",
    "now , the halo orbit is a one - dimensional normally hyperbolic object with one unstable direction .",
    "the halo orbit itself also belongs to the center manifold of @xmath29 and its unstable manifold is a two - dimensional object in the energy surface . finally , by dimension",
    "counting , we notice that a transversal intersection between the unstable manifold of the halo orbit of @xmath159 and the stable manifold of the center manifold of @xmath159 is a one - dimensional object .",
    "-0.1truein    several authors @xcite have explored the center manifolds of collinear libration points by means of lindstedt - poincar expansions of the hamiltonian restricted to each center manifold .",
    "these computations suggest that for the energy levels under consideration in this paper there exist large regions in the center manifold that exhibit quasi - periodic motions .",
    "the @xmath75 sections of the center manifolds reveal that most of these quasi - periodic obits are two - dimensional invariant tori in the center manifold ( see for instance figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "these invariant tori are also normally hyperbolic and their corresponding stable manifolds are two - dimensional objects inside the four - dimensional stable manifold of the center manifold .",
    "these codimension - one stable manifolds separate the four - dimensional stable manifold into regions .",
    "a trajectory in the intersection of the unstable manifold of the halo orbit and the stable manifold of the center manifold has a positive probability of being either on the stable manifold of an invariant torus or in a region bounded by stable manifolds of invariant tori .",
    "it is even possible that the trajectory belongs to the stable manifold of a periodic orbit ( _ e.g. _ , a halo orbit ) in the center manifold of @xmath159 .",
    "however , this is unlikely since the stable manifold of a periodic orbit is a two - dimensional object inside a four - dimensional stable manifold .",
    "thus , it is more likely that a trajectory in the intersection of the unstable manifold of a halo orbit with the stable manifold of the three - dimensional center manifold of a libration point passes close to a two - dimensional hyperbolic quasi - periodic orbit in the center manifold .",
    "[ fig : h1-poincare](a ) and ( b ) show two connections from a halo orbit to a quasi - halo orbit nearby , from the continuation displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1 - 1loop ] , where the energy value @xmath162 matches the value @xmath163 used for figure 1 in @xcite and figure 3 in @xcite , where @xmath164 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1-poincare](c ) and ( d ) we show the intersections of these trajectories with the plane @xmath75 .",
    "if we compare these intersections to the corresponding ones in @xcite and @xcite , we discover that the trajectory seems to approach one of these quasi - halo orbits and then drift away from it .",
    "we conclude that the trajectory computed by our methods is shadowing a connecting orbit in the intersection of the unstable manifold of the halo orbit and the stable manifold of the corresponding normally hyperbolic lower dimensional torus .",
    "in our computations we used the continuation and bifurcation software auto @xcite for computing families of periodic orbits , associated floquet eigenfunctions , unstable manifolds , and connecting orbits .",
    "orbits are continued in auto as solutions to a suitable boundary value problem ( bvp ) , as described in this paper . to compute approximate solutions of bvps",
    ", auto uses the method of gauss - legendre collocation with piecewise polynomials on adaptive meshes @xcite .",
    "these calculations can be fast ; for example the _ entire _ vertical family of periodic orbits @xmath0 can be computed in 0.12 seconds on a dual core laptop , using as few as @xmath165 mesh intervals with 4 gauss collocation points each , and using @xmath166 continuation steps . in our actual computations we use more mesh intervals to ensure high accuracy , _",
    "e.g. _ , with @xmath167 mesh intervals the family @xmath0 can be computed in 0.25 seconds .",
    "we also often use more continuation steps , for example for the purpose of generating data for computer animations .",
    "two - dimensional unstable manifolds computed as a solution family by continuation , as done in sect .",
    "[ sec : manifold - algorithm ] , require more mesh intervals and continuation steps when the orbits in the family wind many times around a torus .",
    "for example , a connection from the halo orbit @xmath1 to a torus near @xmath6 , winding around the torus 12 times , can be reached easily in 15 seconds , using 200 mesh intervals and 1000 continuation steps . however , we also computed such connections with a much higher number of windings , which requires a correspondingly higher number of mesh intervals and continuation steps .",
    "in fact , we have used up to @xmath168 mesh intervals in such cases .",
    "furthermore , to ascertain the correctness of our results , we have computed these manifolds with various choices of the number of mesh intervals .",
    "similarly , the continuation of solutions to the @xmath2-dimensional system to follow periodic - orbit - to - torus connections , as given in sect .",
    "[ sec : connecting - orbits ] and used in sect .",
    "[ sec : connecting - orbits - examples ] , requires a correspondingly high number of mesh intervals . since the dimension of the system is then @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , three times the dimension of the systems used for continuing periodic orbits and unstable manifolds , the computation time would increase by a factor @xmath169 , that is @xmath170 .",
    "however , this is reduced since auto takes into account the zero structure of the submatrices of the full jacobian matrix that correspond to individual mesh intervals . on the other hand ,",
    "the connecting orbit requires significantly more mesh intervals then the base periodic orbit and its floquet eigenfunction , and auto does not take advantage of this .",
    "thus the continuation of the coupled system ( periodic orbit , floquet eigenfunction , connecting orbit ) in sect .",
    "[ sec : connecting - orbits ] can take significant computer time , also because such continuation with varying energy requires many continuation steps .",
    "in extreme cases the calculations have taken up to @xmath171 hours computer time .",
