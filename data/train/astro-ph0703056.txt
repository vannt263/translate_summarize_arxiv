    "in an accompanying letter ( noeske et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter paper i ) , we have studied star formation ( sf ) rates ( sfr ) as a function of stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath1 , for field galaxies in the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) out to @xmath3 .",
    "star - forming galaxies form a defined `` main sequence '' ( ms ) with a limited range of sfr at a given @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this smooth sequence suggests that the same set of few physical processes governs sf in galaxies , unless quenching of their sf occurs .",
    "the evolution of sf along the ms appears dominated by a gradual decline of sfr in individual galaxies since @xmath10 , not by an evolving frequency or amplitude of starbursts . the dominant process that governs sf since @xmath11 is hence likely a gradual one , an obvious candidate being gas exhaustion .",
    "sf histories ( sfhs ) are known to depend on galaxy mass and morphological type , both from studies of local galaxies ( e.g. tinsley 1968 , searle et al .",
    "1973 , sandage 1986 , heavens et al . 2004 ) , and from distant galaxy surveys ( see references in ",
    "i of paper i ) .",
    "the common picture is that massive galaxies formed the bulk of their stars early and on shorter timescales , while numerous less massive galaxies evolve on longer timescales , a phenomenon generally linked to the `` downsizing '' reported by cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we show that a simple model of gas exhaustion with mass - dependent parameters can reproduce and parametrize the observed sfr as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "gas exhaustion may thus be responsible for the gradual decline of sfr that dominates sfhs since @xmath11 along the ms , i.e. in star - forming field galaxies .",
    "following previous authors , we consider specific sfr ( ssfr ) , i.e. sfr/@xmath0 , a simple but powerful indicator of galaxy sfhs ( e.g. kennicutt et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we argue that the onset of major sf occurs systematically later in less massive galaxies .",
    "as in paper i , we take advantage of the sensitivity and panchromatic nature of aegis ; combined sfrs from deep spitzer mips @xmath12 m images and deep2 spectra recover obscured sf in ir - luminous galaxies , and achieve a large dynamic range in sfr by including galaxies not detected at @xmath12 m . for a description of the data , sfr tracers and @xmath0 measurements ,",
    "see section 2 of paper i. we consider all galaxies with robust sfr tracers a ms galaxy - either @xmath12 m detected , or blue sequence galaxies with @xmath13 emission lines ( h@xmath14 , h@xmath15 , or [ oii]3727 ) , thereby excluding red liner / agn candidates ( see paper i ) .",
    "as shown in paper i , this selection likely misses at most @xmath16 of the normally star - forming ms galaxies at @xmath17 , likely less .",
    "we tested the effects of using different combinations of sfr and @xmath0 measures , including galex uv based sfrs , and @xmath0 values from the color - m / l relation of bell et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "all qualitative results of this work are robust against the choice of sfr tracer or @xmath0 estimate , yet quantitative results will vary ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "interpreting the ssfr vs ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) diagrams in terms of mass - dependent sfh is not straightforward , as @xmath0 grows with time for sf galaxies . here",
    "we present the use of a simple exponential model sfh ( @xmath5 models , eq .",
    "1 ) with mass - dependent parameters to quantify mass dependences of sf timescales , and to account for @xmath0 growth .",
    "previous authors have successfully employed @xmath5 models with different @xmath6-folding times @xmath5 to reproduce the spectrophotometric and chemical evolution of different hubble types and masses ( e.g. tinsley 1968 , searle et al .",
    "1973 , koo et al .",
    "1993 , bicker et al .",
    "2004 , savaglio et al .",
    "2005 , weiner et al .",
    "the apparent dominance of smoothly declining sfr in individual galaxies ( paper i ) supports the use of @xmath5 models , which are a one - zone approach to describe sf through continuous gas exhaustion .",
    "we adopt simple closed - box conditions where galaxies have a baryonic mass @xmath18 that is initially gaseous , later the sum of gas ( @xmath19 ) and stellar mass @xmath0 . for instantaneous recycling , with a recycled gas fraction @xmath20 ( kroupa imf ,",
    "bell et al . 2005 ) , and a sf efficiency @xmath21 such that the sfr @xmath22 , one obtains : @xmath23 where @xmath8 is the `` formation redshift '' where sf begins and @xmath24 is the cosmic time at redshift @xmath1 the initial sfr at a given @xmath5 is then @xmath25^{-1 } m_b$ ] .",
    "we parametrize the mass dependence of @xmath5 as a power law of the baryonic mass of the galaxy @xmath26 : @xmath27 fig .",
    "1 ( left column ) shows examples of eq . 1 in the ssfr-@xmath0 plane , compared to the median ssfr of the ms , for different @xmath8 , @xmath28 and @xmath14 .",
    "1 ( left column ) shows that models with mass - dependent @xmath5 can crudely reproduce the median ms of sf galaxies and its redshift evolution for galaxies with @xmath29 out to @xmath10 , if formation redshifts @xmath30 are adopted for all galaxies .",
    "however , the models fall short of reproducing the high ssfr of less massive galaxies .",
    "the model ssfr remain systematically too low , unless we adopt a very low @xmath31 , unphysical for massive galaxies .",
    "the reason is the monotonic decline of the sfr of @xmath5 models .",
    "their present - to - past average sfr ( kennicutt et al . 2005 ) , @xmath32 is always @xmath33 .",
    "the limit for @xmath34 is @xmath35 , which corresponds to the constant sfr that would have formed a galaxy s @xmath0 since @xmath8 .",
    "empirically , the behavior of the ms suggests declining sfhs ( @xmath36 ) , which causes a conflict between the high ssfr for low mass galaxies and the assumption that all galaxies started forming stars at high @xmath37 .",
    "adopting such high @xmath8 , an early start of sf , implies low past - average sfr : @xmath35 then corresponds to low ssfr , reflected in the low upper limits to the ssfr of @xmath5 models .",
    "for these @xmath8 , the high ssfr of many less massive galaxies would imply @xmath38 , a current sfr above the past - average level , i.e. an episode of enhanced sf ( fig .",
    "1 , left ; fig .",
    "the increase of the highest ssfr towards less massive galaxies can be reproduced by allowing the onset of sf to be delayed to lower @xmath8 in less massive galaxies ( see the models for different @xmath8 in fig . 1 , left ) .",
    "we parametrize @xmath8 as a function of mass , similarly to @xmath5 , an approach we refer to as _ staged _ @xmath5 models .",
    "@xmath39 this model interprets high ssfr as the early epoch of smooth sfhs with lower @xmath8 , rather than late episodes of enhanced sf .",
    "it is physically motivated , not an attempt to force an oversimplified model to fit complex sfhs ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "staged @xmath5 models ( right column in fig .",
    "1 ) provide a better description of the median of the ms than @xmath5 models with fixed @xmath8 in the @xmath0 range where the sample is complete , and appear to describe the data also towards lower @xmath0 . staged",
    "models that consider a moderate range of @xmath8 and @xmath5 at a given mass ( dashed red curves ) also reproduce the upper envelope of the ms , which is complete at all observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the lower envelope and apparent broadening of the ms towards lower masses .",
    "models with a range of @xmath8 but no trend with mass would merely introduce a scatter and an offset in the asymptotic ssfr at low masses , but would not change the slope of ssfr(@xmath0 ) to first order ( see the models for different @xmath8 in fig . 1 , left column ) .    the staged @xmath5 model in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) is given by @xmath40 we calculated @xmath41 to scan the model parameter space , but eq . [ best ] is hand - adjusted to reproduce the median and upper and lower limits of the data .",
    "results of a simple @xmath41 minimization to the median would be misleading : best values for all four parameters in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) depend considerably on systematics of , e.g. , sfr and @xmath0 estimates , and the imf ; also , the @xmath42 dependence is mainly constrained by massive galaxies ( fig .",
    "1 ) where our number statistics are poor , and the @xmath43 relation at low masses , where data are incomplete .",
    "an evaluation of the relevant uncertainties must incorporate scatter in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , or a scatter about smooth sf histories , and is postponed to a forthcoming paper .",
    "by direct measurement of sfr and @xmath0 over a large range in mass and @xmath1 , we confirm that the commonly adopted exponential model sfhs can reproduce the average sfh of ms galaxies .",
    "this model can quantify the mass dependence of the associated sf timescales @xmath5 and of the @xmath8 .",
    "the mass dependences of @xmath5 and @xmath8 , and @xmath0 growth through sf , conspire to reproduce the decline of sfr that is similar over a wide @xmath0 range ( paper i ; zheng et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "notably , @xmath5 models are a simple approximation of sf that declines due to gradual gas exhaustion .",
    "their ability to reproduce the evolution of the ms of sf galaxies , along with the limited range of sfr on the ms , implies that gradual gas exhaustion with mass - dependent timescales is a plausible driver of the dominant evolution of sf in galaxies @xmath44 since @xmath11 .",
    "we chose a closed box model which is sufficient to reproduce the coevolution of sf and @xmath0 .",
    "linking the model @xmath0 to , e.g. dark matter halo masses should involve the observed relation between both values at a given @xmath1 , to account for gas accretion and removal in galaxies , which are both not well understood .",
    "the @xmath5 models similarity to the data does _ not _ imply a closed box scenario where gas is merely turned into stars .",
    "additional processes that gradually deplete cold gas  heating or loss  and scale roughly with sfr would also produce sfhs that resemble exponentials .",
    "these processes include feedback from sf , and conceivably agn , given the likely co - evolution of stellar bulges and black holes ( e.g. granato et al .",
    "short @xmath5 obtained for massive galaxies may largely reflect such gas loss processes rather than very efficient sf .",
    "we have considered the depletion of an existing gas reservoir , but the decline of sfr at a given mass is also compatible with the cosmological decline in accretion onto dark halos .",
    "this can be approximated for halo masses near @xmath45 by @xmath46 ( birnboim et al .",
    "2007 ) , giving a factor of @xmath47 between @xmath11 and @xmath48 , similar to the observed decline .",
    "the mean virial accretion in this mass range is predicted to vary as @xmath49 .",
    "if we adopt @xmath50 ( dekel & woo 2003 for sn feedback ) , and , naively , @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 , compatible with the observed mass dependence ( paper i ) .",
    "1 shows the previously described increase of the highest ssfr towards lower @xmath0 .",
    "high ssfr have been interpreted as episodes of sfr above the past average level ( @xmath38 ) , based on the assumption that all galaxies had a relatively high @xmath8 ( see  3 ) ( e.g. , bell et al . 2005 , juneau et al .",
    "2005 , feulner et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "our data indicate that high ssfr often do not represent such irregular or periodic episodes late in the sfh of a galaxy . in fig .",
    "2 , we show ssfr vs @xmath0 as in fig .",
    "1 . we express ssfr in terms of the _ doubling times _ , @xmath53 = [ ( 1-r)\\,ssfr]^{-1}$ ] , within which the current sfr would produce the observed @xmath0 .",
    "small @xmath54 corresponds t high ssfr ; for a declining sfh , a galaxy can be at most as old as @xmath54 .",
    "consider the galaxies at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where the data are @xmath57 complete .",
    "incompleteness affects mostly red galaxies , hence the plot shows @xmath57 of the sf galaxies .",
    "their current sfr would generate their observed @xmath0 within @xmath54 of @xmath58 to @xmath59 , yr , mostly @xmath60yr . these @xmath54 are smaller than half of the age of the universe at @xmath55 .",
    "if we assume a high @xmath61 , @xmath62 of the galaxies have a sfr above the past average @xmath63 , and @xmath64 a starburst ( @xmath65 , kennicutt et al 2005 ) .",
    "would still be 57(21)% .",
    "] at face value , this is contradictory ; it should not be possible for a majority of galaxies to simultaneously undergo a starburst , which by definition should occupy a short part of a duty cycle .",
    "however , these galaxies form the ms , and their sfr show a gradual decline on gyr timescales since @xmath11 ( paper i ) , likely even since @xmath66 , _ not _ an enhancement of sfr in the @xmath1 range shown in fig .",
    "2 . these galaxies therefore do not seem to simultaneously undergo a brief ( @xmath67gyr ) episode of elevated sfr on top of lower - level sfhs ; instead , their high ssfr represent the early , strongly star - forming phase of a sfh that smoothly declines on gyr timescales to @xmath4 .",
    "their high ssfr ( short @xmath54 ) imply ( i ) that this gradually declining epoch must form the bulk of their @xmath0 , and ( ii ) that the galaxies must be observed @xmath68 after the onset of this epoch , suggesting @xmath69 for @xmath70 of these galaxies ; otherwise the produced @xmath0 would be higher than observed",
    ".    these lines of evidence suggest that the observed high ssfr of many galaxies are not due to a periodic or irregular burst , late in their sfh . instead",
    ", many such galaxies seem to be observed shortly after their `` initial burst '' phase , the early stage in their predominantly smooth sfh which forms most of their @xmath0 . moreover , the average ssfr increases smoothly to lower masses , at all @xmath1 .",
    "this points to a smooth dependence of the average @xmath8 on galaxy mass .",
    "based on this evidence , we propose a scenario of _ `` staged galaxy formation '' _ , where the _ average _ onset of the major sf ( @xmath8 ) decreases smoothly with galaxy mass .",
    "this scenario achieves high ssfr without requiring that a large fraction of galaxies at any epoch are elevated in sfr ( @xmath38 ) or starbursting ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "allowing lower @xmath8 for a fraction of less massive galaxies is the only possibility to avoid this contradiction between burst fraction and duty cycle .",
    "the staged @xmath71 models we use to approximate these sfhs parametrize both the decline timescales ( @xmath5 ) , and the onset ( @xmath8 ) , of the main sf episode as a function of mass .    the range of @xmath54 in fig .",
    "2 shows that the staged scenario only requires a fraction of less massive galaxies to form later : the range of @xmath8 must reach to lower @xmath1 for less massive galaxies .",
    "in addition , the model does not exclude some low level sf prior to the onset of the major sf episode , effectively the epoch of assembly .",
    "this allows it to be consistent with the presence of old ( @xmath72gyr ) stars in many low mass local galaxies ( e.g. grebel 2004 ) .",
    "a relation between the galaxy mass and the onset time of the dominant sf episode is observationally and theoretically supported : see heavens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; iwata et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; thomas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for early - type galaxies ; feulner et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , reddy et al . ( 2006 ) and erb et al . (",
    "2006 ) report a systematic decrease of stellar age with @xmath0 up to @xmath73 .",
    "cdm structure formation provides a framework for a systematic relation between the dominant sf epoch and present - day galaxy mass ( neistein et al .",
    "finally , insofar as `` downsizing '' means that a characteristic epoch of high ssfr occurs early in high mass galaxies , while at low @xmath1 only low mass galaxies exhibit high ssfr ( cowie et al 1996 ) , a delayed onset of major sf in less massive galaxies is a natural part of this process .",
