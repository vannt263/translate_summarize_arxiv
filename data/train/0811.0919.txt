    "<S> in this work , we find exact wormhole solutions in the context of noncommutative geometry , and further explore their physical properties and characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density of these wormhole geometries is a smeared and particle - like gravitational source , where the mass is diffused throughout a region of linear dimension @xmath0 due to the intrinsic uncertainty encoded in the coordinate commutator . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also analyze these wormhole geometries considering that the equation governing quantum fluctuations behaves as a backreaction equation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the energy density of the graviton one loop contribution to a classical energy in a traversable wormhole background and the finite one loop energy density is considered as a self - consistent source for these wormhole geometries . </S>",
    "<S> interesting solutions are found for an appropriate range of the parameters , validating the perturbative computation introduced in this semi - classical approach . </S>"
