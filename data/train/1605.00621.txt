    "the derivation of the formula is based on a property of polynomials referred as _ geometric modulus principle _ proved in @xcite , a result that characterizes the cone of ascent and descent directions of polynomial modulus at an arbitrary point in the complex plane .",

    "ascent and descent directions centered at @xmath18 can be used to give a partitioning of a disc of certain radius centered at @xmath18 .",
