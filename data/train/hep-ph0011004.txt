    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is expected to become an important ingredient of new physics beyond the standard model . in particular",
    ", susy provides the most attractive mechanism to stabilize the scale hierarchy between the planck scale , @xmath2 , and the electroweak scale @xmath3 .",
    "because we have not yet observed superparticles up to the order of @xmath3 , susy should be broken at scales above @xmath3 , but not far from @xmath3 .",
    "the phenomenology of susy depends on the mechanism of susy - breaking and on the manner in which susy - breaking in the hidden sector is transmitted to the observable sector .    recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new scenario of susy - breaking mediation was proposed in the framework of a weakly - coupled heterotic string on the calabi - yau compactification . in this scenario ,",
    "the breakdown of supersymmetry in the hidden sector is transmitted to anti - generation fields by gravitational interactions , and subsequent transmission of the breaking to the observable sector occurs through gauge interactions .",
    "it has been shown that the spectra of the superparticles given by the model are phenomenologically viable .    in the mssm , we are confronted with the @xmath0-problem .",
    "the supersymmetric @xmath0 term is the only dimensional parameter in the superpotential @xmath4 the higgs scalar potential is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are soft susy - breaking higgs masses , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12 and @xmath13 gauge coupling constants , respectively .",
    "the @xmath1 term is the soft susy - breaking term for higgs bilinear couplings .",
    "the two higgs fields acquire the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the minimization condition of the scalar potential leads to the relations @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking occurs naturally in the mssm , because @xmath18 becomes negative due to the dominant contribution of top yukawa coupling @xmath19 in the rg evolution as @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the stop mass and @xmath22 is the renormalization scale . for @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) becomes @xmath24 therefore , phenomenologically , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 should satisfy the condition @xmath25 an important question in the mediation of susy - breaking is whether or not we can obtain @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms to be consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath0-problem .",
    "we would like to determine the dynamical mechanism by which @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms are generated .    in the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath1 term is generated by a two - loop diagram through gauge interactions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where anti - generation fields propagate the inner loop , and the remaining internal line has the fermion mass insertion , the @xmath0 term .",
    "it has been shown that this model exhibits a phenomenologically viable solution to the @xmath0-problem .",
    "we now give some comments on the @xmath0-problem .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms are of different characters . since the @xmath0 term is supersymmetric , it can not be generated by quantum effects , as shown by the non - renormalization theorem .",
    "namely , @xmath0 arises only at tree level . on the other hand ,",
    "since the @xmath1 is a soft susy - breaking term , it can be generated by quantum effects associated with susy - breaking .",
    "for example , a simple model for generating these terms has been proposed in the gauge - mediation scenario . in this model ,",
    "the superpotential contains the term @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the singlet superfield .",
    "when @xmath27 develops a nonzero vev , i.e. , @xmath28 , then we obtain @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this scenario ,",
    "the gaugino mass is given by @xmath31 .",
    "when we take @xmath32 , this implies @xmath33 , which is phenomenologically unacceptable .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms have their origin in the same coupling .",
    "thus , it is difficult to avoid this problem , unless we introduce a new symmetry and additional fields by hand .",
    "@xcite however , we choose not to introduce new symmetry and additional fields only for the purpose of solving the @xmath0-problem .",
    "rather , we rely on the flavor symmetry , which is favorable for explaining the quark / lepton mass hierarchy . in this situation , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are represented by independent parameters . as discussed below ,",
    "we show that the magnitude of each term is controlled by flavor symmetry .",
    "for supergravity to be a low energy effective theory of superstrings , all soft terms must depend strongly on the form of the khler potential .",
    "although it is difficult to study the definite form of the khler potential in generic calabi - yau compactification , typical forms are known in special cases , such as the large radius limit and orbifold compactification ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) , and the relation @xmath36 can be derived by approximating the scalar potential .",
    "for this reason , approaches to the @xmath0-problem have been tried only by carrying out suitable modification of forms of the khler potential .",
    "in contrast to such approaches , assuming that khler potential is of the minimal form , we explore an alternative approach to the @xmath0-problem .",
    "in this paper we consider the scenario in which susy - breaking is mediated by anti - generation fields , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and discuss the possibility of generating a @xmath1 term with a seesaw - type mechanism as well as with a loop diagram through gauge interactions , as shown in fig .",
    "further , we study the @xmath0-problem in this scenario .",
    "the model discussed here is based on a string - inspired model .",
    "@xcite the effective theory in the observable sector from the weakly - coupled calabi - yau string is characterized by @xmath38 susy , the @xmath39 gauge group , and massless matter fields which belong to @xmath40 and @xmath41 representations in @xmath39 .",
    "the massless chiral superfields consist of @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the family number at low energies . here",
    ", @xmath44 sets of vector - like multiplets are included in the massless sector .",
    "the numbers @xmath45 and @xmath44 are the generation number and anti - generation number , respectively . we set @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the sake of simplicity . in the effective theory , in general , there appear certain discrete symmetries @xmath48 as a stringy selection rule associated with symmetric structure of the compactified space .",
    "@xcite let us consider the case @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the flavor symmetry and @xmath51 is the @xmath52-parity .",
    "the @xmath52-parity distinguishes @xmath53 from a vector - like set .",
    "it is assumed that ordinary quarks and leptons are included in the chiral multiplets @xmath53 and that the @xmath52-parity of all @xmath54 are odd . because light higgs scalars are even under @xmath52-parity",
    ", light higgs doublets must reside in the set @xmath55 , whose elements are vector - like multiplets .",
    "for this reason we assign even @xmath52-parity to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "hence , through the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry , gauge superfields possibly mix with the vector - like multiplets @xmath56 and @xmath57 but not mix with the chiral multiplets @xmath53 .",
    "no mixing occurs between the vector - like multiplets and the chiral multiplets .",
    "hence , in the low energy region , ordinary quarks and leptons arise from @xmath53 and ordinary higgs fields from @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , there appear a dilaton field @xmath58 , k@xmath59hler class moduli fields @xmath60 , and complex structure moduli fields @xmath61 .",
    "the vev of the dilaton field @xmath58 determines the gauge coupling constant and the vevs of the moduli fields @xmath61 and @xmath60 parametrize the size and shapes of the compactified manifold .",
    "we choose @xmath62 as a typical example of the unification gauge group . with this gauge group , chiral superfields ( @xmath63 ) in the @xmath40 representation of @xmath39",
    "are decomposed as @xmath64 the @xmath62 model has the following attractive features .",
    "@xcite the first feature is that without introducing additional adjoint fields , the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to the standard model gauge group in two steps at scales @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the second feature is that this model is free from triplet - doublet splitting problem , because the light higgs doublets @xmath67 and @xmath68 and the color - triplet higgs @xmath69 and @xmath70 belong to different irreducible representations .",
    "it is assumed that the susy - breaking resulting from gaugino condensation in the hidden sector is only transmitted to the @xmath71-component of the moduli field @xmath72 .",
    "specifically , the moduli field @xmath72 develops a susy - breaking vev , @xmath73 , while both @xmath58 and @xmath74 have vanishing @xmath71-components @xmath75 .",
    "this situation is the same as that in the moduli - dominated susy - breaking scenario . @xcite at present , it is unknown how to specify the seeds of susy - breaking through non - perturbative dynamics in superstring theory .",
    "therefore , we make an assumption regarding the source of susy - breaking .",
    "the superpotential @xmath76 in the observable sector is described in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "since we are interested in the @xmath0-problem , we concentrate our attention on the terms incorporating @xmath79-doublet higgs , @xmath80 where the exponents @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are non - negative integers , which are governed by the flavor symmetry .",
    "hereafter we assume @xmath84 . for a calabi - yau string , generation fields and anti - generation fields in the trilinear terms couple separately to the @xmath74 moduli and the @xmath72 moduli , respectively . in view of this feature of the trilinear terms",
    ", we assume that @xmath85 and @xmath86 depend only on the complex structure moduli @xmath74 and the khler moduli @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath87 and @xmath88 develop nonzero vevs , the above superpotential induces the bilinear terms @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 we now consider the @xmath0 term , which is the first term on the r.h.s . of eq .",

    "moreover , the discrete symmetry ( flavor symmetry ) as a stringy symmetry places strong constraints on the low energy physics , such as the fermion mass hierarchies , mixing angles , and so on .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the discrete symmetry plays an important role also in solving the @xmath0-problem .",
    "furthermore , the seesaw - type mechanism also generates the soft higgs masses .",
