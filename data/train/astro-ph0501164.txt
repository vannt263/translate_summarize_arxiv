    "several solutions have been proposed for the discrepancies .",
    "@xcite showed that temperature fluctuations within nebulae can lead to a @xmath3 ( [ ] ) which overestimates the average emission temperature of the recombination spectrum and the [ ] nebular lines .",
    "as a consequence , the o@xmath6/h@xmath7 ionic abundance ratio derived from the intensity ratio of the [ ] nebular lines to h@xmath8 , assuming @xmath3 ( [ ] ) as the electron temperature , may be grossly underestimated .",
    "the presence of temperature fluctuations will also lead to a @xmath3 ( [ ] ) that is systematically higher than @xmath0 ( ) , the temperature derived from the recombination spectrum .",
    "evidence in favor of this was first presented by @xcite who measured values of @xmath0 ( ) in several h  ii regions and planetary nebulae ( pne ) from the observed magnitude of the h  i balmer jump and found that they are systematically lower than the corresponding values of @xmath3 ( [ ] ) of the same nebulae .",
    "a parameter @xmath9 was introduced by @xcite to characterize the magnitude of temperature fluctuations in a given nebula .",

    "moreover , recent observational studies of several samples of pne show that typical values of @xmath9 derived by comparing @xmath0 ( [ ] ) and @xmath3 ( ) are so large that they are well beyond the predictions of any photoionization models @xcite unless extra energy input ( such as from magnetic reconnection or from shocks ) is considered .    a more plausible solution for the discrepancies of temperature and abundance determinations using cels and orls is the two - component nebular model with hydrogen - deficient inclusions embedded in the diffuse nebula first proposed by @xcite .",
    "unlike the purely phenomenological temperature fluctuations scenario , the two - component nebular model provides a physical explanation for the temperature and abundance determination discrepancies .",
    "the model assumes that there is a small amount of h - deficient material embedded in the diffuse nebula of `` normal '' composition . due to the much enhanced cooling rates by ir fine - structure lines of heavy element ions as a result of the high metallicity , hydrogen - deficient inclusions have so low an electron temperature that they emit copiously in orls but essentially not at all in cels . in this scenario ,",
    "the high heavy elemental abundances yielded by orls simply reflect the enhanced metallicity in those h - deficient inclusions , rather than representing the overall chemical composition of the whole nebula .",
    "detailed two - abundance photoionization models incorporating h - deficient inclusions have been constructed by @xcite .",
    "the models provide a satisfying explanation for the apparent large discrepancies between the results of temperature and abundance determinations using cels and orls , for the pne , and .",
    "contrary to the temperature fluctuations scenario , the two - component nebular model does not need any extra energy input to reproduce the large temperature inhomogeneities within pne . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of such h - deficient inclusions is not predicted by any of the current theories of the nucleosynthesis and evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars and their nature and origin remain unclear .",
    "one possibility is that they are evaporating icy planetesimals ( liu 2003 ) .",

    "the intensity ratio of a recombination line to that of h@xmath8 , @xmath115 observed from a nebula is given by @xmath116_h+[n_{\\rm e}n({\\rm he}^+)\\varepsilon_iv]_l}{[n_{\\rm e}n({\\rm h}^+)\\varepsilon_{{\\rm h}\\beta}v]_h+[n_{\\rm e}n({\\rm h}^+)\\varepsilon_{{\\rm h}\\beta}v]_l}\\frac{4861}{\\lambda_i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is the he@xmath7/h@xmath7 ionic abundance ratio determined assuming a chemically homogeneous nebula . from the above equation we find , @xmath118\\left[\\frac{n({\\rm he}^+)}{n({\\rm h}^+)}\\right]_l.\\ ] ]    for the small amount of h - deficient material as hypothesized in the two - abundance model , the average he@xmath7/h@xmath7 ionic abundance ratio for the entire nebula is essentially identical to the value for the diffuse material , i.e. @xmath119_l$ ] .",
    "in such a case , the traditional method of abundance analysis assuming a chemically homogeneous nebula will overestimate the he / h abundance by a factor of [ @xmath120 . for the representative values of @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath121 , the he@xmath7/h@xmath7 ionic abundance ratio will be overestimated by a factor of 1.25 .",
    "for example , the empirical analysis of ngc6153 by @xcite assuming a chemically homogeneous nebula yields a he / h elemental abundance ratio of 0.136 , which is a factor of 1.35 higher than the average he / h abundance ratio for the entire ionized region derived from the detailed two - abundance photoionization modeling of this nebula by @xcite .",
    "the much lower he / h abundance ratio obtained by two - abundance photoionization modeling is supported by observations of the collisional excitation dominated 2s@xmath11s ",

    "many pne are known to show enhancement of helium with respect to the sun .",
    "for example , the average he / h ratio obtained by @xcite for a large sample of galactic pne is a factor of 1.35 solar .",
    "the enhancement is often ascribed to the second and third dredge - up processes that occur during the post - main - sequence evolution stages of the progenitor stars of pne .",
    "however , the extremely high he abundances deduced for pne such as @xcite are difficult to explain by the current theories of nucleosynthesis and dredge - up processes .",
    "it is possible therefore that the very high he / h abundances observed in those extreme he - rich pne are actually caused by the contribution of h - deficient inclusions embedded in the nebulae .",
    "the cel / orl abundance discrepancy and the bj / cel temperature discrepancy which are ubiquitously observed amongst pne are also found in regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the determination of @xmath0 ( ) for regions is much more difficult than for pne due to the generally much lower surface brightness of h  ii regions and the strong contamination of scattered star light to the nebular spectrum in dusty h  ii regions .",

    "they derived @xmath0 ( ) of @xmath122k and @xmath0 ( [ ] ) of @xmath123  k , in agreement with the general pattern observed amongst pne that @xmath0 ( ) is systematically lower than @xmath0 ( [ ] ) . on the other hand , from the @xmath124 line",
    "fluxes reported in their paper , we obtain @xmath0 ( ) of @xmath125k , which is consistent with @xmath0 ( ) within the errors .",
    "note that has a relatively small orl / cel abundance discrepancy ( a factor of 1.8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 ( ) and @xmath3 ( ) in more h  ii regions are needed , especially for those exhibiting large orl / cel abundance discrepancies in order to have a better picture of this problem in h  ii regions .",
    "for a few metal poor extragalactic regions , @xcite find that the electron temperatures derived from recombination lines are also systematically lower than the corresponding values deduced from the [ ] forbidden line ratio .",
    "if we ascribe the discrepancy to the presence of h - deficient inclusions in these nebulae , then the effects of these inclusions on the determination of the primordial helium abundance can be estimated roughly from eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 15 ) . using the line fluxes presented by @xcite and assuming that the h - deficient material in these metal - poor h  ii regions have similar composition as those postulated to exist in pn",
    ", we estimate that the primordial he abundance could have been overestimated by as much as 5% .",
    "in this paper , we show that recombination lines can be used to probe nebular thermal structures and provide vital information regarding the nature and physical causes of the long - standing orl / cel temperature and abundance determination discrepancies .",
    "we present electron temperatures derived from the @xmath31 ratio for 48 pne .",
    "the temperatures are found to be systematically lower than those deduced from the balmer jump of the recombination spectrum .",
    "the result is exactly opposite to the predictions of the scenarios of temperature fluctuation and density inhomogeneities but in good agreement with the expectations of the two - abundance nebular model proposed by @xcite .",
    "we estimate that a filling factor of the order of @xmath5 of the ultra - cold , h - deficient material is sufficient to explain the observed differences between the and temperatures .",
    "we show that the possible presence of h - deficient inclusions in pne may indicate that current estimates of he / h abundances in pne may have been overestimated by a factor of @xmath126 .",
