    "by necessity , the calculation of radiative corrections ( rc ) to spin-1/2 baryon semileptonic decays ( bsd ) requires that definite charges be chosen for the participating particles . in previous calculations  @xcite we have chosen a negatively charged emitted lepton and either a neutral or a negatively charged decaying baryon .",
    "this covers all of hyperon semileptonic decays , with the exception of @xmath0 .",
    "if the polarization of the baryons is not involved , the previous results can be extended  @xcite to cover this latter decay using a very practical rule , which also applies to @xmath1 . however , when heavy quarks are involved several other charge arrangements for the baryons appear , and then one faces the problem of having to recalculate the accompanying rc . in particular doubly - charged baryons must also be considered .",
    "recently , preliminary evidence for double - charm baryons has been reported  @xcite , so it is also timely to study the rc to semileptonic decays of such baryons .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to obtain the rc to bsd with all the charge assignments to the baryons allowed when heavy quarks are involved .",
    "our main result will show that with proper adaptations , the previous results obtained with the initial choices of baryon charges can also be used to obtain the rc to the other charge assignment possibilities .",
    "let us list the several types of bsd we have to discuss .",
    "for definiteness we shall take as a heavy quark the charm quark , i.e. , we shall consider the four quarks @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "their charges are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 and their strong flavors are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath9 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath9 , @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "their semileptonic decays are @xmath15 in parentheses we display the selection rules these decays obey , in terms of the charges and strong flavors involved .",
    "in addition , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements should accompany these selection rules .    at the hadron level these quarks can form twenty baryons .",
    "eight carry no charm , nine carry single charm , and three carry double charm .",
    "the semileptonic decays of these baryons are grouped into @xmath16    the bsd of the eight hyperons fall in the groups ( 5 ) or ( 6 ) , with the exception of @xmath0 which falls in group ( 7 ) .",
    "many charm baryon ( or bottom baryon ) decays will fall in some of the groups ( 5)-(7 ) , but the last groups ( 8)-(10 ) necessarily require the intervention of charm . for completeness ,",
    "let us list the bsd with appreciable phase - space according to the above groups .",
    "we use the naming scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , whose greek symbol indicates isospin and subindex indicates heavy quark content .",
    "all of these decays are driven , at the quark level , by the semileptonic decays ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , or ( 4 ) , @xmath17    we have omitted above those decays with very small phase space driven by ( 1 ) and also those decays which are overwhelmed by strong decays , like @xmath18or by electromagnetic decays , like @xmath19 .",
    "in what follows we shall obtain model - independent rc , according to the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite , which include terms of zeroth and first order in @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the four - momentum transfer and @xmath23 is the mass of @xmath24 we shall not impose any kinematical constraint on the four - momentum of the bremsstrahlung photon , so that our results will be useful both in what in previous papers we referred to as the three - body and four - body regions .",
    "we shall allow for non - zero polarization @xmath25 of the decaying baryon @xmath26 .",
    "our first task is to extend the rc with polarized @xmath26 obtained for @xmath27 emission in groups ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , to decays with @xmath28 emission in groups ( 7 ) and ( 8) .",
    "this is done in sect .",
    "a simple and practical rule is obtained , analogous to the rule of ref .",
    "the groups of decays involving double charge of one of the baryons will be discussed in sect .",
    "although this requires more effort , again a simple rule is obtained . finally , in sect .",
    "iv we discuss our analysis .",
    "when @xmath26 is not polarized the rc with @xmath28 emission in groups ( 7 ) and ( 8) are easily obtained from the final results of groups ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) when @xmath29 is emitted , using the rule of ref .",
    "however , this rule does not apply to the rc to the part of the differential decay rate , and along with it to the dalitz plot ( dp ) containing the polarization of @xmath26 .",
    "it is the purpose of this section to obtain the corresponding rule . to do this",
    "requires that we review the calculation of rc at intermediate steps and trace the changes introduced by @xmath28 emission .",
    "the rule will allow us to use the final expressions with @xmath27 emission to obtain directly the final result with @xmath28 emission .",
    "we shall first discuss the decays @xmath30 of group ( 8) . the calculation of its virtual rc follows the same steps of the corresponding calculation of @xmath31 of group ( 6 ) .",
    "these corrections are split into a finite , calculable , and model - independent part and into a model - dependent one , which can be absorbed into the form factors of the uncorrected amplitude @xmath32 .",
    "this last is indicated by putting primes on the form factors and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the decay amplitude with virtual radiative corrections turns out to be @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , whereas @xmath38 , after integrations over the virtual photon four - momentum , is given by @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",

( 47 ) @xmath184    this equation is the same as @xmath185    in the last term on the rhs the contributions of zeroth order in @xmath186 , that is contributions of order @xmath187 , are the same in both amplitudes @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "therefore this difference of amplitudes is of order @xmath128 .",
    "accordingly , its square is of order @xmath190 and should be neglected .",
    "hence , the differential decay rate with bremsstrahlung radiative corrections has the form @xmath191    repeating the same analysis , we obtain for processes @xmath146 @xmath192    adding eqs .  ( 35 ) and ( 51 ) for the process @xmath193 , and adding eqs .",
    "( 36 ) and ( 52 ) for @xmath194 , we get the complete differential decay rates with radiative corrections up to order @xmath128 ,",
    "@xmath195 @xmath196 this completes our study of rc to decays in groups ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "bsd with heavy quarks involved present many choices for the charges of the participating baryons .",
    "all these decays can be classified into six different groups , ( 5)-(10 ) .",
    "the rc to these decays were calculated assuming the specific charge assignments of groups ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . to cover the other assignments one faces the need of recalculating the rc .",
    "this can be avoided by reviewing the previous calculations . in this paper",
    "we obtained first the changes to be made in the final results of the calculations for decays in groups ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) to obtain the final results of the charge assignments in groups ( 7 ) and ( 8) when @xmath26 is polarized .",
    "these changes take the form of a very practical rule , which complements the rule when @xmath26 is unpolarized .",
    "second , we proceeded to determine the changes required in the final results of decays in groups ( 5)-(8 ) to obtain the final results of decays in groups ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "the final results for the latter are given as simple linear combinations of the final results of decays in the four former groups .",
    "in short , the rc to decays in groups ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) can be directly used to obtain the final results of all charge assignments of bsd involving heavy quarks .",
    "although we studied specifically the case of charm being the heavy quark , our conclusions also apply if bottom is the heavy quark and if several heavy quarks , one charm and one bottom , both bottom , etc . , are present .",
    "the case of top being one of the heavy quarks would also be covered by the charge assignments ( 6)-(10 ) , although it is not expected that top will form bound baryonic states .",
    "this last possibility is only of academic interest .",
    "our results are model - independent and they are not compromised to particular values of the form factors .",
    "the charged lepton is not restricted in any way , so @xmath197 may be @xmath198 , @xmath199 , or @xmath200 .",
    "both cases of polarized or unpolarized decaying baryon @xmath26 are covered .",
    "the three - body and four - body regions of the dp are also covered . for unpolarized @xmath26 ,",
    "previous results for ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are complete to orders @xmath187 and @xmath128 . when @xmath26 is polarized they are complete to order @xmath187 . in the near future",
    "we hope to include contributions of order @xmath128 .    before closing let us discuss the practical usefulness of our results . for this purpose",
    "we must assess the validity of our approximations with respect to experimental error bars of observables in bsd . by low , medium , and high statistics experiments",
    "we mean those with several hundreds , thousands , and hundreds of thousands of events , respectively .",
    "the corresponding error bars of the observables are around 6 - 10% , 2 - 5% , and 1% or better , respectively .",
    "our model - independent rc must be discussed also in percentage .",
    "it is convenient to separate the rc in the coulomb and in the non - coulomb contributions , when the former is present .",
    "the reason for this is that it is appreciably larger than the latter by a factor two and even close to five in some cases . from previous numerical calculations we know that the non - coulomb part is around 1% and",
    "may come close to 2% .",
    "conservatively , we can then take this part to be 2% .    let us further clarify our approximations .",
    "they consisted in neglecting the model - dependent terms of order @xmath190 and higher in the rc .",
    "this of course does not mean that we have neglected all terms of such orders in the model - independent part .",
    "in particular , it must be noted that the coulomb part arising from the pole in the amplitude of fig .  1a , whose position is fixed by the velocity @xmath201 of @xmath113 , gets its @xmath202 and higher order corrections from the uncorrected differential decay rate . therefore all of these higher order contributions are accounted for .",
    "it is then clear that our approximations apply only to the non - coulomb part .",
    "the variation of @xmath203 in processes ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) is quite important .",
    "taking @xmath204 one can make estimates for this ratio in different bsd . in ( 1 ) @xmath205 , in ( 2 ) @xmath206 , in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) @xmath207 . in decays",
    "when the heavier bottom quark is involved this ratio may become even larger . for @xmath208 one",
    "has @xmath207 again , but for @xmath209 one has @xmath210 . to make an estimate of the percentage theoretical error involved in our approximations it is not convenient to use the product @xmath211 with @xmath212 because one obtains very small numbers this way .",
    "it is better to multiply the above conservative estimate of 2% of the non - coulomb rc [ involving the order @xmath211 with @xmath213 and multiply it by @xmath214 with @xmath212 . for ( 1 )",
    "these numbers are negligibly small . for",
    "( 2 ) they are @xmath215 and @xmath216 for @xmath212 , respectively , and are also negligible .",
    "for ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) they are @xmath217 and @xmath218 , and adding them one has @xmath219 .",
    "the case @xmath208 repeats ( 3 ) . when @xmath220 one has @xmath221 and @xmath222 for @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "the sum gives an estimate of @xmath223 .",
    "it is customary that the theoretical error ( or bias ) be folded in quadratures with the experimental error bars .",
    "one can then ignore this bias if the latter is not changed appreciably . a change of no more than @xmath224 is reasonable .",
    "this means that the theoretical bias should not exceed one - half of the experimental error bars . to remain conservative",
    "we shall require that the former does not exceed one - fourth of the latter .",
    "we can draw conclusions comparing the above estimates with the expected error bars of experiments .",
    "when ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are involved our results are very good in high statistics experiments . for ( 3 ) ,",
    "( 4 ) and @xmath208 they are good in low and still acceptable medium statistics experiments .",
    "however , they are no longer good for high statistics experiments .",
    "the same occurs in the cases @xmath220 , they are quite good in low statistics experiments and are still acceptable in medium statistics experiments .",
    "however , in high statistics ones they are no longer acceptable in general .",
    "it is in these latter cases that terms of order @xmath225 and higher should be added to our results .",
    "this should be done in the future when eventually it becomes necessary .",
    "although , then one will have to face problem of the model - dependence of rc .",
    "however , rc can be rendered smaller in particular cases because of cancellations due to the values of the form factors involved .",
    "this must be checked case by case .",
    "thus , it may still be possible to use our results in high statistics experiments when such fortuitous cancellations occur . finally , let us stress that our results use previous expressions that are either analytical or presented in a form ready to be integrated numerically .",
    "previous numerical results can not be used because masses and form factors were given particular values .",
    "the authors wish to express their gratitude to consejo nacional de ciencia y tecnologa ( mexico ) for partial support .",
    "two of us ( amv and jjt ) express their gratitude to comisin de operacin y fomento de actividades acadmicas ( instituto politcnico nacional ) ."
