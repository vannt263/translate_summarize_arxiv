    "spherically symmetric perfect - fluid models admitting a homothetic killing vector has attracted considerable attention during the last couple of decades ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that the homothetic killing vector reduces the field equations of spherically symmetric perfect - fluid models from partial to ordinary differential equations .",
    "this simplification does not mean that these so - called self - similar models do not contain interesting physical phenomena  quite the contrary . the possibility of violation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis @xcite and the existence of sonic surfaces ( shock waves ) @xcite are some examples .",
    "the growth of primordial black holes and the evolution of voids can also be studied using self - similar perturbations of the flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model @xcite . in recent years",
    "it has become clear that self - similar models are of crucial importance for the understanding of black hole formation through gravitational collapse . in the full space of spherically symmetric solutions , certain self - similar solutions are separatrices between dispersive solutions and solutions developing black holes @xcite .",
    "self - similar spherically symmetric perfect - fluid models exhibit several preferred geometric structures .",
    "there are two preferred directions corresponding to the 4-velocity of the fluid and the homothetic killing vector , respectively .",
    "adapting the coordinates to the 4-velocity of the fluid leads to the ` comoving fluid approach ' @xcite . adapting the coordinates to the homothetic killing vector leads to the ` homothetic approach ' @xcite .",
    "the spherical symmetry surfaces also constitute a preferred geometric structure .",
    "the area of the spherical symmetry surfaces is used as a coordinate in the ` schwarzschild approach ' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also some other possibilities , e.g. synchronous coordinate systems and null coordinates , which are useful for discussing singularities @xcite .",
    "all these approaches are complementary and a full understanding probably relies on a combination of results obtained in the various approaches .    in this paper we will use the diagonal homothetic approach .",
    "this has the advantage of yielding equations which are very similar to those of hypersurface homogeneous models .",
    "there exists a wealth of literature on how to treat such models .",
    "thus many of the ideas obtained in this area can be carried over into the realm of self - similar spherically symmetric models . however , there are of course disadvantages as well .",
    "the symmetry surfaces will in general change causality .",
    "thus , in the diagonal homothetic approach the spacetime has to be covered with two coordinate patches ; one for when the homothetic killing vector is spacelike and one for when it is timelike .",
    "then these two regions must be joined where the homothetic killing vector is null .    in a previous paper @xcite we considered the spatially self - similar ( sss ) spherically symmetric models . in the present paper",
    "we consider the case of timelike symmetry surfaces , constituting the so - called timelike self - similar ( tss ) spherically symmetric models .",
    "we obtain a full phase space picture which leads to a more complete understanding of these models than has been previously obtained",
    ". thus the work presented here confirms , corrects and expands the analysis of several authors @xcite .",
    "the tss spherically symmetric models are characterized by a four - dimensional homothetic symmetry group @xmath0 acting multiply transitively on three - dimensional timelike hypersurfaces .",
    "the line element , written in diagonal form where one of the coordinates is adapted to the homothetic symmetry , takes the form @xcite @xmath1 .\\ ] ] we will consider perfect - fluid models .",
    "the energy momentum tensor , @xmath2 , is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy density , @xmath5 is the pressure , and @xmath6 the 4-velocity of the fluid .",
    "we will assume @xmath7 as an equation of state where the parameter @xmath8 takes values in the interval @xmath9 , which include radiation ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we have excluded dust ( @xmath11 ) and stiff fluids ( @xmath12 ) as they behave quite differently compared to those in the above interval and need special treatment .",
    "the dust solutions are explicitly known ( these models are just special cases of the general spherically symmetric dust solutions , which are all known explicitly , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    the outline of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "einstein s field equations are rewritten in terms of a dimensionless set of variables , in order to obtain a maximal reduction of the coupled system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the variables are chosen so that they take values in a compact phase space . in section 3 the equations are subsequently analysed by using the theory of dynamical systems . in section 4 a numerical investigation is undertaken and global dynamical features are considered .",
    "appendix a describes the properties of the fluid congruence and also the condition for the spacetimes to belong to petrov type 0 .",
    "appendix b gives the relation between various coordinates and the relation between the present variables and other variables used in the literature .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce @xmath13 where a dot denotes @xmath14 .",
    "the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath16 describe the kinematical properties of the normal congruence of the symmetry surfaces in the static @xmath17 spacetime that is conformally related to the physical spacetime @xmath18 with the homothetic factor @xmath19 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; @xmath15 is the expansion while @xmath16 describes the shear of the normal congruence of the symmetry surfaces in @xmath17 .",
    "expressed in an orthonormal frame , the fluid 4-velocity is parametrized by @xmath20 .",
    "einstein s field equations , @xmath21 , and the equations of motion for the fluid , @xmath22 , lead to a set of evolution equations for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in addition , a constraint equation , and equations for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are obtained .",
