    "atom interferometry is emerging as a very important avenue of precision metrology .",
    "it has been used as a gyroscope  @xcite as well as an accelerometer  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used for accurate measurements of gravity  @xcite , gradients in gravity  @xcite , as well as gravitational red - shift  @xcite .",
    "other applications include measurement of fine structure constants with high precision  @xcite , as well as the realization of a matter - wave clock  @xcite .",
    "the rotation sensitivity of an atom interferometric gyroscope ( aig ) is due to the phase difference between two paths arising from the sagnac effect  @xcite .",
    "this phase difference is proportional to the area enclosed by the interferometer as well as the mass of each atom .",
    "motivated by this mass dependence of the rotation sensitivity of an aig , we have recently proposed an interferometer that exploits the collective excitation of an ensemble of atoms  @xcite . to explain the principle behind this briefly",
    ", we consider an assembly of @xmath0 non - interacting identical two - level atoms , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) . for a practical atomic interferometer ,",
    "these levels are actually metastable hyperfine ground levels , coupled to an intermediate state via off - resonant counter - propagating optical fields .",
    "however , the basic concept can be illustrated by considering these two states to be coupled by a single , traveling laser field  @xcite .",
    "the atoms are initially prepared in quantum state @xmath8 , denoting that in this state the atoms are stationary along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "a laser beam propagating along the @xmath9-axis will impart a momentum @xmath10 to an atom upon absorption of a single photon , driving it to a superposition of the states @xmath8 and @xmath11 , with the amplitude of each state depending on the intensity of the laser beam , @xmath12 , and the time of interaction , @xmath13 .    in a single atom interferometer ,",
    "a two - level atom is first split into an equal superposition of @xmath8 and @xmath11 by a @xmath14-pulse ( so that @xmath15 ) . after letting this split atom drift freely for time @xmath16 ,",
    "the two states are inverted and redirected by a @xmath17-pulse . at the end of another free drift time , @xmath16",
    ", the two paths are recombined by another @xmath14-pulse .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](b ) . a possible phase difference , @xmath18 between the two paths manifests itself in the amplitude of the states at the end of the @xmath19 sequence .",
    "for example , the amplitude of @xmath20 at the end of the interferometric sequence varies as @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to make a similar interferometer using only a single zone excitation  @xcite    ( a ) ensemble of @xmath0 two - level atoms in a classical laser field propagating the @xmath9-direction , ( b ) a single atom interferometer produced via @xmath19 sequence of excitation . ]",
    "we have shown in ref .   how an ensemble of @xmath0 atoms can be used to make a collective state atomic interferometer ( cosain ) which also makes use of the @xmath19 pulse sequence employing counter propagating raman excitations in a @xmath22 system , but has properties that differ very significantly from the conventional raman atomic interferometer ( crain ) employing the same pulse sequence .",
    "for example , the width of the fringes generated as a function of the differential phase between the two paths ( or , equivalently , a rotation applied perpendicular to its plane ) is reduced by a factor of @xmath23 , when compared to the same for the crain . the minimum measurable phase shift , under quantum noise limited ( qnl ) operation ,",
    "is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of interrogations per unit time , @xmath26 is the total observation time , and @xmath27 is the quantum efficiency of detecting one of the collective states .",
    "this is to be compared with the same for a crain , which is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the flux of atoms per unit time , and @xmath30 is the quantum efficiency of detecting each atom . for comparison , we consider a situation where @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 can be substantially smaller than @xmath33 , since @xmath27 can be very close to unity , while @xmath30 is generally very small because of geometric constraints encountered in collecting fluorescence from the atoms  @xcite .",
    "in order to understand the basic principles of operation of such an interferometer , it is instructive to recall first the dicke states  @xcite .    in ref .",
    ", dicke showed that for a dilute ensemble of n atoms where the atoms do not interact , the ensemble evolves to a superposition of @xmath6 symmetric states ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "some of the possible dicke states are defined as follows @xmath34 etc .",
    "where @xmath35 .     schematic illustration of some of the possible symmetric collective states and coupling strength to their adjacent states . ]",
    "a cosain is configured essentially the same way as the crain , with two exceptions .",
    "first , it must make use of trapped atoms , released sequentially to the interferometer .",
    "second , the detection process is designed to measure the probability of finding all the atoms in one of the collective states , such as @xmath36 .",
    "the reduction in the width of the fringe occurs due to a combination of the interferences among all the collective states , which follow different paths .",
    "details of this process can be found in ref .  .",
    "we have also shown how a collective state atomic clock ( cosac ) can be realized in this way , also with a @xmath23 reduction in the width of the fringes  @xcite . just as the cosain is a variant of the crain ,",
    "the cosac is a variant of the conventional raman atomic clock ( corac )  @xcite . in ref .",
    ", we show how a conventional microwave clock  @xcite can also be converted into a cosac .",
    "as noted above , the cosain makes use of counter - propagating raman transitions . as such",
    ", the characteristic wave number is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the wave numbers of the two laser beams .",
    "the non - zero temperature of a mot provides a spread in the velocity of the constituent atoms .",
    "therefore , each atom in the ensemble experiences a doppler shift leading to a spread in detuning , with a zero mean value . due to the finite size of the ensemble ,",
    "each atom may experience a slightly different rabi frequency depending on the spatial variation in the intensity profile of the laser beam .",
    "these factors contribute to a complex picture of an ensemble in a practical experiment .",
    "furthermore , a semiclassical treatment of a quantum mechanical problem is not adequate .",
    "the wavepacket nature of the atoms must also be taken into account by considering the center of mass ( com ) momentum of the atomic states .    in this paper , we present a description of collective states under generalized and non - ideal conditions , including a situation where the motion of the center of mass ( com ) of each atom is treated quantum mechanically .",
    "such a comprehensive model of the collective states currently does not exist in literature , and is important for understanding the behavior of the cosain .",
    "this comprehensive model of collective states , including the case where the com motion is quantized , is also likely to help advance the analysis and optimization of spin squeezing  @xcite , under non - idealities that are unavoidable in any practical scheme . the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiclass ] we describe the semiclassical model of generalized collective excitation to lay down the mathematical framework on which our analysis is based . for the sake of simplicity and transparency ,",
    "we introduce the concepts first with the example of a @xmath41-atom ensemble identical to the dicke formalism of collective excitation .",
    "next , we analyze how variable rabi frequencies and atomic velocities affect this simple ensemble . in sec .",
    "[ sec : natom ] , this investigation is extended to a general @xmath0-atom ensemble .",
    "in particular , we show that under certain conditions , the generalized asymmetric states of an ensemble are not decoupled from the symmetric set .",
    "we develop the general method of finding the generalized collective symmetric and asymmetric states in an ensemble of arbitrary size . in sec.[sec : quantizedcom ] , we consider the com motion degree of freedom of the atoms and investigate the implications of the wavepacket nature of the atoms , and therefore , of the ensemble .",
    "without loss of generality , we consider a collection of @xmath0 two level atoms , released from a cold trap , excited by a laser field traveling in the * z * direction , assuming the field amplitude to be of gaussian profile in * x * and * y * directions , and constant in the * z * direction . each atom is modeled as having two energy levels , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as mentioned earlier , a @xmath22-type atomic system excited by a pair of optically off - resonant laser fields propagating in opposite directions can be modeled as an effective two level system of this type  @xcite , so that the decay rate of the @xmath43 state can be set to zero .",
    "this effective two - level system is shown in fig 1(a ) , where @xmath44 is the frequency of the laser field , assumed to be resonant for stationary atoms .",
    "each atom , however , experiences a different doppler shift due to the thermal motion of the atoms , and consequently , a different effective laser frequency , @xmath45 .",
    "the net consequence of this is that the @xmath1-th atom picks up a detuning of @xmath4 depending on its velocity .",
    "the rabi frequency , @xmath2 experienced by the @xmath1-th atom depends on its position .",
    "the laser field is assumed , arbitrarily , to be polarized in the * x * direction . in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the electric field at any point @xmath46 , defined arbitrarily with respect to an origin , can be expressed as @xmath47\\cos(\\omega_0t - kz)$ ] , where @xmath48 represents the width of the laser beam in the transverse directions .",
    "assume now that , at @xmath49 , the @xmath1-th atom is positioned at @xmath50 , and is moving at a velocity @xmath51 .",
    "we ignore for now any change to this velocity due to the interaction with the laser field .",
    "this issue will be addressed later when we consider the motion of the com of the atom quantum mechanically . in the reference frame of this atom , which is defined by the vector @xmath52 , the electric field",
    "can be expressed as @xmath53\\cos[\\omega_0t - k(z_{0i}+v_{zi}t)]$ ] .",
    "the transverse motion of the atom will lead to a time dependent variation of the amplitude of the rabi frequency .",
    "we assume that , for typical systems of interest , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so that this variation can be ignored . we can then write the field seen by the atom in its reference frame as @xmath56\\cos(\\omega_{0i}t-\\xi_i)$ ] , where @xmath57 is the doppler shifted frequency seen by the atom , and @xmath58 is a reference phase relation , determined by the initial position of the atom , between the atom and the field for all values of @xmath13 .    in the electric dipole approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath1-th atom can be written as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the com momentum in the z - direction , @xmath61 is the internal energy of the atom , @xmath62 is the position of the electron with respect to the nucleus , @xmath63 is the electronic charge , and @xmath29 is the mass of the atom . as mentioned above , we are treating the motion of the com of the atom semiclassically , deferring the quantum mechanical model thereof to a later part of this paper . as such , the com term in the hamiltonian can be ignored . upon making the rotating - wave approximation , @xmath64 can then be expressed in the bases of @xmath42 and @xmath43 as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "the state of this atom , @xmath68 evolves according to the schrdinger equation , @xmath69 .",
    "we define a transformed state vector @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a unitary transformation , defined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian for this state vector is then @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 . to render @xmath77 time independent , we set @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "now , setting @xmath80 , @xmath81 makes @xmath77 independent of any phase factor as well . in this frame , the @xmath82-transformed hamiltonian thus becomes @xmath83 the new basis vectors , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are related to the original basis vectors as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "assuming that the @xmath1-th atom is initially in the state @xmath88 , its quantum state can be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the effective coupling frequency of this atom .",
    "since we assume no interaction among the atoms , the ensemble hamiltonian is the sum of all the individual hamiltonians corresponding to each atom in the ensemble , @xmath91 .",
    "the state of the ensemble , therefore , evolves according to the schrdinger equation , @xmath92 .",
    "for illustrative purposes , as well as transparency , let us consider first the case of @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94 can be expressed as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the identity operator in the basis of @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the @xmath1-th atom .",
    "for instance , @xmath97 . using this process , we can now express @xmath94 in the basis of product states of the two atoms , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 as @xmath102    consider first the case where all the rabi frequencies are the same , and there are no detunings .",
    "the @xmath82-transformed hamiltonian for each atom is then formally identical , since the phase factors due to different positions are encoded in the transformed basis states @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the coupled collective states would now be formally identical to the symmetric dicke states .",
    "for example , @xmath103    it should be noted that each of the constituent individual atomic states in these expressions include the temporal and spatial phase factors .",
    "thus , these states behave the same way as the conventional dicke symmetric collective states , independent of the distance between the two atoms .",
    "it should also be noted that there exists another collective state , @xmath104 which remains fully uncoupled from the symmetric set .",
    "the states @xmath105 and @xmath106 result from a @xmath107 rotation in the hilbert subspace spanned by @xmath99 and @xmath100 , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig_3](a ) .    consider next the case where there is still no detuning , but the rabi frequencies are unequal .",
    "it is not obvious what the form of the symmetric collective states should be in this case .",
    "consider first the task of finding the first excited symmetric collective state ( scs ) .",
    "since the @xmath108 state will , by definition , be coupled only to this state , we can define this state , in general , as @xmath109 where the denominator ensures that this state is normalized .",
    "when applied to the particular case at hand , we thus get @xmath110 .    a rotation operator , @xmath111 , rotates the hilbert sub - space , @xmath112 , formed by @xmath99 and @xmath100 by an angle @xmath113 , such that one of the resulting states is @xmath105 .",
    "this also produces a state @xmath114 , which is orthogonal to @xmath105 . in this rotated frame ,",
    "the ensemble hamiltonian , @xmath115 becomes @xmath116 thus , the asymmetric collective state ( acs ) , @xmath106 does not remain isolated but is coupled to @xmath117 , which , in turn is coupled to @xmath105 .",
    "consider next the case where we also allow for potentially different detunings for the two atoms , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "it is easy to see , based on the general definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq_e1_from_g ] ) of the first excited scs , that @xmath105 has the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq_e1_from_g ] ) .",
    "similarly , the expression for @xmath106 is also the same as above , and these states are generated by the same rotation operator , @xmath111 , as given above .",
    "however , the coupling between the states in this rotated basis are now modified .",
    "explicitly the ensemble @xmath82-transformed hamiltonian in the rotated frame becomes @xmath120 thus , the acs @xmath106 is now coupled directly to the scs @xmath105 , in addition to being coupled to the state @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , the energies of the states are also shifted with respect to @xmath108 .",
    "these couplings and shifts are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](b ) .",
    "( a ) rotation of basis states to form collective states in a two - atom ensemble , ( b ) the complete set of all collective states and relevant couplings and detunings in a two - atom ensemble . ]    in an ensemble with a large number of atoms , the number of asymmetric states is far larger than that of the symmetric states . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss a more generalized view of collective states , considering the variations in different parameters and manifestations thereof in the behavior of the collective states .    in the preceding discussions , we have taken into account the facts that each atom is at a unique position ( which means that it sees a unique phase of the laser ) , sees a potentially unique rabi frequency , and is moving with a particular velocity which in turn produces a doppler shift .",
    "a natural question that may arise is whether we are taking into account the fact that the position of each atom is changing with time , so that it would see a time varying rabi frequency and laser phase .",
    "the temporal variation in rabi frequency can be ignored because the velocity of each atom is assumed to be very small . in appendix",
    "[ sec : append ] , we show that the temporal change in the laser phase seen by the atom is akin to taking into account the doppler shift .",
    "the hamiltonian of an ensemble of @xmath0 non - interacting and non - overlapping atoms is simply given by the sum of the hamiltonians of the constituent atoms as noted above .",
    "it is convenient to express these as a sum of three parts : raising , lowering and detuning : @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . the raising part of the hamiltonian ,",
    "@xmath125 couples @xmath126 to its adjacent higher scs , @xmath127 .",
    "similarly , the lowering part of the hamiltonian , @xmath128 couples @xmath126 to its adjacent lower scs , @xmath129 .",
    "the function of the third term , @xmath130 is two fold .",
    "first , it leads to a shift in the energy of the collective states ( symmetric and asymmetric ) .",
    "second , under certain conditions , it leads to a coupling between the scs and all the acs s , as well as among all the acs s , within the same manifold ( i.e. , the set of collective states corresponding to the absorption of a given number of photons ) .",
    "analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq_e1_from_g ] ) , @xmath127 can be generated from @xmath126 , for any value of @xmath25 , using the following prescription @xmath131    to illustrate the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq_en+1_from_en ] ) , we first consider the ideal case where each atom sees the same rabi frequency , and experiences no doppler shift , but still allowing for the fact that different atoms see different spatial phases . since @xmath132 , the asymmetric states remain fully uncoupled from the symmetric states . using eq .",
    "( [ eq_en+1_from_en ] ) , we can now easily find @xmath105 , noting that @xmath133 .",
    "application of @xmath134 to @xmath108 , upon normalization , then leads to the result that @xmath135 .",
    "this is essentially the same as the well - known first - excitation dicke state , with the exception that the spatial phases seen by the individual atoms are incorporated in the constituent states @xmath136 and @xmath137 , as noted before in the context of @xmath93 .",
    "it is now easy to see how to generate @xmath126 for any value of @xmath25 , by repeated application of @xmath134 , and allowing for the normalization , as prescribed by eq .",
    "( [ eq_en+1_from_en ] ) . specifically , we get @xmath138 where @xmath139 , and @xmath140 is the permutation operator @xcite .    under the ideal condition being considered here , the acs s",
    "remain fully decoupled from the symmetric set at all times , as noted above . as such",
    ", an explicit description of the forms of the acs s is not necessary for understanding the behavior of the ensemble .",
    "however , when we consider non - idealities later , it will be important to understand the form of the acs s .",
    "therefore , we discuss here how to determine these states explicitly in the ideal case , and a simple modification of this approach will then be used later on for the non - ideal cases , where the acs s are relevant .    consider a particular manifold corresponding to the absorption of @xmath25 photons .",
    "the scs is @xmath126 , and there are @xmath141 acs s , denoted as @xmath142 for @xmath143 to @xmath141 . to find these states , we consider @xmath144 , the hilbert sub - space of dimension @xmath145 spanned by the states @xmath146 .",
    "the elements of @xmath144 are arbitrarily labeled @xmath147 .",
    "the scs is a particular vector in this hilbert space , and the acs s are any set of mutually orthogonal vectors that are all normal to the scs .",
    "thus , the set of acs s is not unique , and there are many ways to construct them .",
    "the standard procedure for finding such a set of orthonormal vectors is the gram - schmidt orthogonalization ( gso ) process . from a geometric point of view",
    ", the gso process can be seen as a set of generalized rotations ( with potentially complex angles ) in the hilbert space .",
    "given that the scs consists of a superposition of the basis vectors with real coefficients , these rotations can be viewed in terms of physical angles for @xmath93 and @xmath148 , whereas for @xmath149 , the angles have to be interpreted in an abstract manner . in order to elucidate our understanding of the acs s , we first formulate the construction of acs s for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath25 , by successive rotations of the hilbert subspace , @xmath144 .",
    "we then illustrate the application of this model for @xmath150 for constructing some explicit version of the acs s ( noting that the @xmath93 case has only a single acs which can be found trivially and has been explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiclass ] ) .",
    "the elements of @xmath144 , labeled @xmath147 , form the coordinate axes of this hilbert space . in this picture",
    ", we can represent the scs as @xmath151 , a vector that makes an angle , @xmath152 with each of the axes .",
    "thus , to find all the collective states of @xmath144 , including the scs and all the acs s , we proceed as follows .",
    "we start with the original set of coordinate axes : @xmath147 .",
    "we then carry out a set of @xmath141 rotations , producing a new set of coordinate axes that are mutually orthogonal .",
    "the rotation angles are chosen to ensure that after the @xmath141 rotations , one of the coordinate axes is parallel to @xmath153 ( which is the scs ) , so that the remaining set of coordinate axes can be identified as the acs s .",

    "as mentioned earlier , we have been investigating the use of atomic ensembles for a collective state atomic interferometer ( cosain ) . in a conventional raman atomic interferometer ( crain ) , one must take into account the quantum nature of the com motion .",
