    "a subgame perfect equilibrium is one of the fundamental solution concepts in game theory .",
    "its characterization is very simple : a strategy profile is a subgame perfect equilibrium if it constitutes a nash equilibrium of every subgame of the original game . in extensive form games with perfect information ,",
    "subgame perfect equilibrium coincides with backward - induction and can be easily determined .    in this work",
    "we study the distribution of the subgame perfect equilibrium outcome in random two - player extensive form games . in these games there",
    "are two potential natural degrees of randomness that may be considered .",
    "the first is random payoffs where the payoffs at the leaves of the tree are randomly drawn .",
    "the second is random assignment of players to nodes , where one of the two decision makers at every node is drawn at random in accordance with a certain distribution .",
    "we restrict attention to binary trees with two players and focus on the case where the payoffs are i.i.d .",
    "uniform random draws over a given domain @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis combines the two potential sources of randomness and relates properties of the subgame perfect equilibrium outcome to a solution concept in the theory of bargaining .",
    "the existing literature on random games focuses on normal form games and studies properties such as the expected number of nash equilibrium @xcite , the distribution of pure nash equilibria @xcite or the maximal number of equilibria @xcite .",
    "here we restrict our attention to random extensive form games .",
    "we consider binary random games and study the asymptotic properties of the subgame perfect equilibrium outcome when the depth is increasing .",
    "the fundamental natural question that arises is under which condition the limit exists and whether in some sense the subgame perfect distribution _ concentrates _ around a certain point , i.e. , whether the subgame perfect equilibrium outcome is close to a certain point with probability close to 1 , for sufficiently deep trees . such a concentration point ,",
    "if exists , may serve as a benchmark solution for a bargaining problem with @xmath0 as its feasible set .",
    "indeed this point has quite solid strategic justification : for _ _ almost all _ _ for the correct dimension @xmath1 ) .",
    "note that analyzing probability under i.i.d .",
    "uniform distribution is equivalent to analyzing the lebesgue measure . ]",
    "strategic interactions of a quite natural type with outcomes in @xmath0 , the solution of the interaction will be close to this concentration point , i.e. , for large enough perfect information games over binary trees ( with a particular assignment of players to control the nodes ) and with payoffs in @xmath0 . hence we are interested in characterizing the cases where concentration occurs , and these cases will induce interesting incites into bargaining theory .    our main theorem introduces the _ random extensive form _ bargaining solution that naturally arises from random extensive form games ( see section [ section : atb ] ) .",
    "we characterize our solution concept by introducing a sequence of increasing random extensive form games for which concentration around a point holds .",
    "this point defines our solution concept and satisfies the three core axioms of a standard solution concept in bargaining : symmetry , efficiency and scale invariance .      starting with nash  @xcite in 1950",
    ", the bargaining problem has been widely studied from different perspectives .",
    "two complementary trusts of the bargaining theory are the _",
    "axiomatic approach _ and _ implementation theory_. the axiomatic approach aims to understand what should be the solution of a bargaining problem by introducing basic properties that it should satisfy .",
    "however , this approach provides no strategic reasoning for how this solution arises .",
    "the so - called  nash program \" aims to support solutions in a non - cooperative framework .",
    "this is exactly where implementation theory comes to play , where the goal is to design a game ( i.e. , a bargaining mechanism ) whose equilibrium is the solution .",
    "many axioms have been suggested in the context of bargaining . among the suggested axioms , the _ standard",
    "_ axioms that are satisfied by most of the classical solutions ( e.g. , nash solution @xcite , kalai - smorodinski solution @xcite , and others ) are pareto efficiency , symmetry , and invariance with respect to positive affine transformations .",
    "the terminology of kalai - smorodinsky @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , defines a solution to be _ standard _ if it satisfies these three axioms",
    ". our focus will be on implementing a standard solution .",
    "implementation theory in bargaining , and in particular implementation in subgame perfect equilibrium , has been widely studied .",
    "several mechanisms @xcite have been suggested for implementing standard bargaining solutions .",
    "all these mechanisms are based on the idea that players sequentially offer an allocation that should be approved by the other players .",
    "we take a different approach to the implementation problem , and we pose the question : can a random extensive form game serve as an implementation to a standard bargaining solution ?",
    "theorem [ theo : bar ] constitutes a positive answer to this question .",
    "this approach differs from the above @xcite in the following aspects .",
    "first , the designed game is _ not _ based on offers and approvals .",
    "second , it has minimalistic requirements about the abilities of the designer : it is sufficient that the designer will be able to draw outcomes from the bargaining set uniformly at random ( as outcomes of the game ) in order to design a game whose equilibrium outcome is ( close to ) a standard solution .",
    "third , our result , in some sense , answers the following type of questions : how hard is it to implement a standard solution ?",
    "how structured should the designed game be ?",
    "our result can be interpreted as follows , _ almost all _ binary choice large enough extensive form games ( with a particular random structure of the decision maker over the nodes ) implement a standard bargaining solution .      for ease of clarity of the presentation , throughout the paper",
    "we focus on a specific simple setting .",
    "as shown in comment 1 of section [ sec : discussion ] , our analysis holds in much more general settings .",
    "we let @xmath2 be a compact convex set is not essential ; see comment 1 of section [ sec : discussion ] . ] .",
    "let @xmath3 be the uniform distribution over with positive density over @xmath0 ; see comment 1 of section [ sec : discussion ] . ]",
    "the game is played over a complete binary tree of depth @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 payoffs at the leaves are random independent draws in accordance with @xmath3 .",
    "we consider two benchmark models of assigning players to control nodes in the tree :    1 .   _ the alternating game .",
    "_ player 1 controls all nodes at depths @xmath6 player 2 controls all nodes at depths @xmath7 .",
    "such a game ( with random payoffs ) will be denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   _ the random controlling player game . _",
    "each player @xmath9 controls each node with probability @xmath10 , where the controlling player at each node is drawn independently across the nodes and independently of the payoffs . such a game ( with random controlling players and random payoffs )",
    "will be denoted by @xmath11 .    in section",
    "[ sec : bar ] we consider additional assignments of players to nodes , which combines these two models .    for both players @xmath9 , both random games @xmath8 and",

    "therefore , both @xmath8 and @xmath11 have almost surely unique subgame perfect equilibrium .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 and @xmath14 the random variable of the _ games value _ , which is the payoff profile at the unique subgame perfect equilibrium .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic properties of the values @xmath13 and @xmath14 when @xmath15 .",
    "in particular are interested in the phenomena of _ concentration of the value _ which holds if there exists a point @xmath16 such that the probability that @xmath17 lies in a given neighborhood of @xmath18 goes to one as the depth of the tree goes to infinity .",

    "@xmath20 if the sequence @xmath17 weakly converges to the dirac measure on the singleton @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "we start our analysis with the zero - sum case , namely @xmath22 .",
    "the results for random zero - sum games are as follows :    * for the alternating game , @xmath13 concentrates around the point @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( theorem [ th : zs ] ) .",
    "* for the random controlling player model , however , we do not have a concentration result .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath25 , i.e. , the value is distributed according to the distribution of the initial payoffs for all @xmath4 ( proposition [ pro : zs ] )",
    ".    then we turn to the non - zero sum case where @xmath0 is a convex set with non - empty interior .",
    "the results for this case are as follows :    * for the alternating game , @xmath13 concentrates around a pareto efficient point ( theorem [ th : gd ] ) .",
    "* for the random controlling player game , although we do not have a concentration around a point , we do have a concentration of @xmath14 around the pareto efficient boundary ( proposition [ pro : gen ] ) .",

    "the set @xmath0 can be considered as the feasible set of alternatives .",

    "concentration of the value around a point .",
    "another two natural properties that are common to most solution concepts in bargaining ( the _ standard axioms _ ) are :    1 .",

    "2 .   symmetry : for every symmetric sets @xmath0 the solution should be symmetric .    by considering the results mentioned so far , we see that none of the suggested random extensive form games enjoys all three properties .",
