    "a large class of soft matter systems can be described generically as massive charged particles immersed in a neutralizing medium of lighter particles .",
    "@xcite two well - known examples are colloidal suspensions  @xcite and complex ( dusty ) plasmas .",
    "@xcite the interaction between the massive particles is a key issue to adequately understand most of the phenomena in these systems .",
    "although it can be rather complex in real situations , it is often assumed that the electrical interactions between the particles can be described , in the zero approximation , by the yukawa ( also known as the screened coulomb or debye - hckel ) repulsive potential @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle charge , @xmath2 is the debye screening length associated with the neutralizing medium , and @xmath3 is the distance between a pair of particles .",
    "the effect of the neutralizing medium on the effective interactions between the particles can involve more than only screening .",
    "this is particularly relevant in complex plasmas , where continuous absorption of plasma electrons and ions on the particle surface result in inverse - power - law asymptotes of interaction at large interparticle separations .",
    "@xcite plasma production and loss processes can also produce a double - yukawa interaction potential characterized by two different screening lengths .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , many experimentally observed trends can be already reproduced by the simplest model considering point - like particles interacting via the repulsive yukawa potential ( [ yukawa ] ) , at least qualitatively .",
    "for this reason this model , which we will refer to as the single component yukawa system , has received a great deal of interest .",
    "another remarkable property , which makes the model yukawa interaction particularly important for the soft condensed matter research , is that by varying @xmath2 an extremely broad range of interaction steepness can be explored .",
    "the two limiting cases correspond to extremely soft unscreened coulomb interaction ( one - component - plasma limit ) for @xmath4 and extremely steep hard - sphere - like repulsion for @xmath5 .",
    "depending on the strength of the interparticle interaction , yukawa systems can be regarded as weakly or strongly coupled .",
    "weak coupling corresponds to the situation when the energy of the interaction at a characteristic mean interparticle separation @xmath6 is much smaller than the system temperature @xmath7 ( expressed in energy units ) , so that @xmath8 . in this regime",
    "the interaction provides only small corrections to the thermodynamic quantities of an ideal gas .",
    "these corrections can be relatively easy evaluated ( e.g. by means of the second virial coefficient ) . in the opposite regime , @xmath9 ,",
    "the interaction produce significant ( or dominant ) contribution to the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the particles form either the fluid phase or , at even stronger coupling , the solid phase .",
    "evaluation of thermodynamic properties becomes less trivial than in the limit of weak coupling .",
    "the focus of the present paper is , therefore , on the strong coupling regime .",
    "thermodynamic properties and phase diagram of strongly coupled yukawa systems are relatively well investigated using various computational and analytical techniques .",
    "some relevant examples include monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) numerical simulations ,  @xcite as well as integral equation theoretical studies  @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "@xcite in particular , accurate results for the excess internal energy obtained in md and mc simulations have been tabulated in refs .   for a number of state points in the phase diagram of yukawa systems . however , since the calculation of other thermodynamic functions requires knowledge of certain integrals and derivatives of the excess energy ( see examples below ) , these data are very useful as reference points , but less appropriate as a practical tool for estimating thermodynamic properties .",
    "semi - empirical fitting formulas  @xcite and simplistic approaches  @xcite to estimate thermodynamics of yukawa systems have been also discussed in the literature .",
    "these can be useful in certain situations , but are not very helpful when sufficient accuracy is required .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to describe simple practical approach to evaluate thermodynamic properties of yukawa systems at strong coupling , _ both in the fluid and solid phases_. the approach is based on simple phenomenological arguments , which can be also relevant to a wider class of soft repulsive interactions .",
    "the accuracy of the approach is tested by calculating the compressibility factor and comparing this with available as well as new results from direct computer simulations .",
    "we also use the recently proposed shortest - graph method ,  @xcite which allows to calculate the radial distribution function and , hence , pressure in crystals .",
    "the relative deviations between theoretical and simulation results normally do not exceed one part in one thousand for dense fluids not too far from crystallization and solids not too close to the melting point .",
    "the largest deviations are documented for the solid phase near melting transition and superheated solid , but even there they are below @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the proposed approach represents very convenient and accurate tool to estimate thermodynamics of yukawa and other related systems in a very broad parameter regime .",
    "the main thermodynamic quantities of interest here are the internal energy @xmath11 , helmholtz free energy @xmath12 , and pressure @xmath13 of the system of @xmath14 yukawa particles , occupying volume @xmath15 and having temperature @xmath7 .",
    "these thermodynamic functions are related via  @xcite @xmath16 we will use conventional reduced units : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the latter ratio , @xmath20 , is also known as the compressibility factor .",
    "the single component yukawa system is conventionally characterized by two dimensionless parameters .",
    "the first is the coupling parameter , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the wigner - seitz radius and the temperature @xmath7 is expressed in energy units throughout this paper .",
    "the second is the screening parameter , @xmath23 .",
    "it is useful to express reduced thermodynamic functions in terms of yukawa system phase state variables , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for a fixed number of particles we have @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this implies @xmath28 the following equations for the reduced thermodynamic functions are then obtained : @xmath29 and @xmath30    to conclude this section we remind that in this paper we consider exclusively the single component yukawa system , where thermodynamics is completely determined by particle - particle interactions and correlations . in real systems ( e.g. complex plasmas or colloidal suspensions ) neutralizing medium is normally present to neutralize and stabilize like - charged particles . in this case",
    ", particle - medium interactions also affect thermodynamics",
    ". however , the effect of particle - medium interactions is additive to that of particle - particles interactions and can be easily evaluated .",
    "@xcite for example , the excess ( free ) energy associated with the presence of neutralizing medium ( e.g. plasma ) is @xmath31 note that the contribution of the neutralizing medium is negative and dominant at strong coupling , implying that the excess energy and pressure of the corresponding system are also negative in this regime .",
    "for the single component yukawa system these quantities are obviously positive .",
    "the reduced excess energy of a solid in the harmonic approximation is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the corresponding lattice sum ( madelung constant ) .",
    "the reduced helmholtz free energy of a solid is related to the excess energy by the standard integration [ eq .  ( [ f_def ] ) ] , which yields @xmath34 where the integration starts from @xmath35  the coupling parameter at the fluid - solid phase transition , and @xmath36 .",
    "according to the ross melting criterion ,  @xcite which he obtained by reformulating the celebrated lindemann melting law in terms of the statistical - mechanical partition function @xmath37 where @xmath38 is some constant .",
    "in other words , the thermal component of the reduced excess free energy remains _ approximately _ constant at melting .",
    "et al_.  @xcite observed that @xmath39 for several inverse - power - law ( ipl ) repulsive potentials .",
    "more recently , agrawal and kofke  @xcite documented some dependence of @xmath38 on the potential softness ( @xmath38 somewhat increases for softer potentials ) for a wide range of ipl potentials .",
    "however , this variation remains relatively weak , with @xmath40 in a very wide range of softness investigated .",
    "we have calculated the values of @xmath38 at melting of the bcc and fcc yukawa solids , in the harmonic lattice approximation , using the data tabulated in refs .  .",
    "in addition to neglecting anharmonic corrections , we assumed that fluid - bcc and fluid - fcc transition lines are very close to each other in the parameter regime of present interest ( for the confirmation see fig .",
    "7 of ref .  )",
    "so that a unique value of @xmath35 can be used ( this is further justified by the fact that @xmath35 appears under the logarithm when calculating @xmath38 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . taking into account some scattering in the data points ,",
    "it is reasonable to apply linear fitting procedure .",
    "this yields @xmath41    the resulting expression for the reduced free energy of the solid phase is @xmath42+{\\mathcal c}(\\kappa).\\ ] ] to use eq .",
    "( [ f_sol ] ) for practical evaluations we need to specify the dependence @xmath43 . a simple expression proposed by vaulina _",

    "a simple practical approach to estimate thermodynamic properties of strongly coupled yukawa systems , both in the fluid and solid phases is presented .",
    "the excess free energy is obtained by a standard integration of the expressions for the excess internal energy using the rt scaling in the dense fluid phase and harmonic lattice approximation in the solid phase .",
    "the integration starts from the freezing / melting point ( where the fluid and solid free energies are equal by the conventional definition of this phase transition in yukawa systems ) and requires the knowledge about the location of this point and excess free energy at this point .",
    "this information is available from earlier numerical simulations .",
    "the accuracy of the approach is verified by calculating the compressibility factors in a wide parameter regime and comparing the results with those from direct md and mc computer simulations .",
    "the relative deviations are documented to be less than @xmath10 for solids in the near - melting and superheated regimes and more than one order of magnitude smaller in other regimes investigated . given the simplicity and accuracy of the approach , it represents very convenient practical tools to estimate thermodynamic properties of yukawa systems in a very broad range of parameters .",
    "the important reason behind the success of the present approximation is that the static component of the internal energy dominates over the thermal component for soft repulsive interactions .",
    "this ensures that some deviations from the quasi - universal behavior of @xmath54 for yukawa fluids lead only to very minor corrections of the total internal energy .",
    "this also guarantees that anharmonic corrections to @xmath54 in the solid phase do not play very important role .",
    "to get an idea how soft the repulsion should be , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the static component of the internal energy at freezing , @xmath55 , along with the rough estimate of the thermal energy at freezing , @xmath56 , as functions of the screening parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the two curves intersect around @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the absolute upper boundary of the approach applicability can be estimated as @xmath58 . for larger @xmath24",
    "the thermal energy plays significant or dominant role , the rt scaling in its simple form used here is no more applicable ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , anharmonic corrections can play certain role .    taking into account certain universal scalings in the behavior of simple condensed matter systems",
    "@xcite we can suggest a more general criteria of the applicability of the approach described in this paper .",
    "we conjecture that it should ( possibly with some minor modifications ) be applicable to soft repulsive systems with the generalized softness parameter @xmath59 above certain threshold .",
    "the generalized softness parameter introduced in ref",
    ".   reads @xmath60^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 characterizes the mean interparticle distance and @xmath61 is the pairwise interaction potential .",
    "for example , for the inverse - power law ( ipl ) interactions @xmath62 we get the conventional definition @xmath63 . using the yukawa potential and adopting @xmath58",
    "we obtain the threshold @xmath64 .",
    "this implies for instance , that thermodynamics of the ipl systems with @xmath65 can be treated in a manner similar to that applied here to yukawa systems .",
    "indeed , the rt scaling [ eq .  ( [ fit ] ) with constant @xmath66 works well for ipl with @xmath67 , is slightly less appropriate for @xmath68 , and significant deviations are observed for @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see fig . 1 of ref .  ) .",
    "we expect that the present approach can also be helpful in connection with the thermodynamics of systems exhibiting water - like anomalies ( gaussian core , exp-6 , hertz and related model potentials ) in the regime of sufficiently soft interaction ( high density ) , but this requires proper verification .",
    "another interesting question is to which extent the shortest - graph method is applicable for these model systems taking into account their rich solid polymorphism .",
    "this is also left for future studies .",
    "the last remark concerns the relevance of the single component yukawa model to real systems , like complex ( dusty ) plasmas or colloidal suspensions .",
    "first of all , the effect of neutralizing medium has to be properly taken into account .",
    "this should not constitute a major problem as we briefly discussed in sec .",
    "second , the idealized model considered here does not account for some important properties of real systems .",
    "for example , the openness of complex plasma systems is known to be responsible for some deviations from the model yukawa interaction ( as was pointed out in the introduction ) and variability of the particle charge .",
    "these issues have been repeatedly discussed in recent publications and we refer the reader to refs .  .",
    "it is not clear at the moment how large the related modifications to thermodynamic properties can be and whether they can be evaluated using conventional methods .",
    "nevertheless , the present approach can be an important element in constructing more realistic and accurate models for the thermodynamics of real systems .",
