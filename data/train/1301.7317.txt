    "before the gradual definition of galaxies that took place one century ago , the formation , evolution , and structure of the universe were put into question in europe , with a special intensity during the early modern period . to the 18@xmath0 centuries . ] many authors , even without enough observational data of the most basic physical properties of distant objects , attempted to give explanations to the nature and constitution of the cosmos far beyond the solar system .",
    "one can not expect to find in the 17@xmath0 and 18@xmath0 centuries precise definitions of the characteristics of galaxies in terms that we now understand .",
    "the lack of scientific information at that time makes this an impossible task .",
    "therefore , when reading astronomical texts from this period we must be aware of the huge gap that separates us from them with regard to the state of astronomy and , consequently , we can not demand that they provide in this context useful , measurable , or testable ideas for current astronomers .",
    "notwithstanding , the debates and hypotheses from this period fueled the further development of science .",
    "even the discourses that remained within a religious or philosophical context triggered a field for discussion , pointing out topics and research areas that were the grounds for future theories and observations .",
    "some authors may be considered from our perspective obscure thinkers or defenders of erroneous pseudo - scientific statements ; however , they were also significant , insofar as they dealt with non - established  and , sometimes , non - accepted  ideas nevertheless containing key elements for setting the right ( big ) questions astronomy had to answer .",
    "subjects from the 17@xmath0 and the 18@xmath0 centuries such as the plurality of worlds , the vortex hypothesis , or the ( in most of the cases highly intuitive ) ideas around the nature of the milky way and the nebulae , are usually disregarded for not having significant scientific value . however , without these debates , the formulation of ` right ' theories could not have taken place .    in this text",
    "i present some basic considerations for a better understanding of certain aspects from the history of astronomy in the early modern period that made possible a gradual awareness of the actual structure of the universe : the vortex hypothesis , the plurality of worlds , and the first speculations on the milky way and the nebulae , which were discussed in europe by many scientists and philosophers , such as descartes , swedenborg , or kant , during the 17@xmath0 and 18@xmath0 centuries . just after this period william herschel focussed the investigations on nebulae , finally leading to modern galaxy studies .",
    "one of the most radical starting points for the ` new astronomy ' that arose at the end of the 16@xmath0 century and consolidated in the course of the 17@xmath0 and 18@xmath0 centuries in europe was the idea that the cosmos is composed of a plurality of worlds .",
    "this notion involved many innovative ideas , which were widely discussed together or separately but , in any case , which were perceived by the authors of that time as a single and solid tradition .",
    "it generated a trend in scientific and philosophical texts that contributed , on the one hand , to put emphasis on the question about the structure of the universe and , on the other , to popularize scientific topics in an unprecedented way .",
    "the russian - french historian of science alexandre koyr ( 18921964 ) proposed in the middle of the 20@xmath0 century a very lucid approach to early modern science based on the ideas around the structure of the universe as a whole @xcite .",
    "his inquiry was basically centered on how authors from the 17@xmath0 and 18@xmath0 centuries tackled the question of the infinitude of the universe .",
    "this way of approaching history , in which giordano bruno ( 15481600 ) is more relevant and revolutionary than copernicus ( 14731543 ) , puts forward important ( and until then mostly forgotten ) elements to comprehend the change of mentalities that gradually led to the modern world .",
    "while koyr attracted our attention to the radical transformation that took place during this time with regard to the general notions on the structure of the universe ( his famous statement  from a closed world to an infinite universe \" ) , a critical approach to the tradition of the plurality of worlds can provide the most relevant clues for understanding how the particular constitution of this new ( infinite or , at least , unprecedentedly enormous ) universe was defined .    in the early 1980s",
    "the tradition of the plurality of worlds was subjected to two major examinations that are still a reference for the field : the well - known investigations by steven j. @xcite and michael j. @xcite . in spite of the significance of these texts in pointing out the necessity of integrating this topic within a serious history of astronomy",
    ", they both put the emphasis on one of the aspects regarding the plurality of worlds , namely the possible existence of extraterrestrial life .",
    "however , even though it was a very important topic in the history of astronomy , the most groundbreaking element of this tradition concerned the specific notions around the structure of the universe , from which the possible existence of life in other heavenly bodies was a side - effect , and not the core of the hypotheses .",
    "the scientific , philosophical , and even literary tradition of the plurality of worlds generated a general debate about the possible constitution of the cosmos beyond the solar system that stimulated much research , conjecture , and passionate discussion on the topic throughout europe .    from our perspective , at first glance one may be tempted to undervalue these contributions for not being based on reliable scientific data .",
    "however , these ideas can seem astonishing if we put it this way : in spite of the lack of information , only starting from very simple observations and mainly proceeding by reasoning , these authors managed to foresee that the universe goes far beyond the solar system and the observable stars , that there are many autonomous and interconnected systems similar to ours ( as hypothesized in the first stages of the plurality of worlds ) , and that the milky way and the nebulae are evidence for understanding the general structure ( such as wright of durham or kant considered , at a time when the intense investigation of nebulae had not yet started around 964 . for a brief introduction to the main pre - messier studies on nebulae",
    "see @xcite . ] ) .",
    "most of these authors were not able to give precise ( or accurate ) explanations of the physical properties of the other systems , nor to determine their size or their distances with respect to us .",
    "but , in view of the state of the astronomical knowledge within this context at that period , this is not a surprise .",
    "these early notions , though imprecise or inaccurate compared to our current understanding , were nevertheless crucial in establishing the framework of the field that had to be explored in the future .",
    "the discussions on the plurality of worlds were not specific references dispersed in various books . instead , this set of ideas constituted a historical tendency , a body of knowledge that put specific topics into question and generated a particular tradition of authors and texts .",
    "as a matter of fact , without taking this chapter of our history into serious consideration , it is impossible to fully understand the early roots of modern notions on the structure of the universe .",
    "a similar role to giordano bruno in koyr s analysis is played by ren descartes ( 15961650 ) within the history of the plurality of worlds , even though he did not focus on the ` worlds ' themselves , but rather on the vortices . with his physical model",
    ", descartes revolutionized the way of thinking about the structure of the universe .",
    "furthermore , unlike bruno , he was not prosecuted for his thinking , such that this kind of debate became generally accepted .    in his major scientific texts",
    "@xcite developed the first serious attempt in early modern europe to understand the nature and physics of extrasolar systems .",
    "he postulated the probable existence of many entities outside the solar system , which should be similar to it in their basic characteristics but , at the same time , independent , autonomous , and able to interact among each other .",
    "descartes not only described a universe made up of independent and distant systems , but also how these vortices were formed and were subjected to an ongoing evolution .",
    "thus , the works mentioned above were entirely devoted to explaining the formation , evolution and construction of the universe . during the centuries that preceded him , the origin of the universe",
    "was sometimes discussed , but mostly within the religious framework of the bible ( more precisely the book of genesis ) . through his works , descartes initiated the trend of taking cosmology into consideration strictly within a scientific perspective .",
    "afterward , other authors tackled the origin and evolution of the universe as a normal topic in astronomy , while there were still authors who confused them with religious notions .",
    "this was not the case with descartes ; he kept religious explanations out of his understanding of the physical world .",
    "fascinated by the idea of a vast universe composed of a multitude of systems , many authors embraced the vortices as the most revolutionary hypothesis in astronomy so far , which became the paradigm for a secularized science .",
    "this new corpus of ideas achieved exceptional popularity mainly owing to the great success of the book _",
    "conversations on the plurality of worlds _ , published by bernard le bovier de fontenelle ( 16571757 ) in paris in 1686 and republished again and again in many countries and languages throughout the course of several centuries ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fontenelle , following descartes ideas , helped in a significant way to change the general opinion of europeans regarding the structure of the universe .    at that point in history , neither the milky way nor the nebulae had a prominent position in the explanations on the structure of the universe .",
    "instead , the solar system  or the solar vortex , which according to the cartesian terminology , contained the solar system  was the paradigmatic piece in the constitution of the cosmos .",
    "in other words , in the pre - galactic cosmos , the solar system was the referential unit .",
    "although the cartesian vortices and the worlds were not defined according to the dimensions or properties of the galaxies , they represented a necessary initial step within a gradual change of paradigms regarding the constitution of the universe .",
    "one century after the publication of descartes texts , his vortex hypothesis was still considered a valid model .",
    "this was in spite of the supporters of newton , who usually set them in opposition and , as a result , systematically discarded all ideas coming from the french scientist .",
    "one of the late advocates of the vortices was the swedish scientist and theologian emanuel swedenborg ( 16881772 ) , a ` mystic scientist ' in a similar way to thomas wright of durham ( in fact they were contemporaries ; see sect .",
    "[ mw ] ) , as he was also driven by scientific and religious motivations without making any distinction between them .",
    "nevertheless , the most analytical and scientific part of their hypothesis was relevant in view of the later development of science , especially in the context of cosmology .    in _ the first principles of natural things _",
    "@xcite , swedenborg developed a complete description of the formation and evolution of the universe according to the vortices , while providing many of the details that had remained unelaborated by descartes .",
    "he described the universe in terms of its transformation processes : the many systems are ( after descartes ) in a constant process of collision , merging , vanishing , and change .",
    "the systems of his cosmos were being created or destroyed at all times .",
    "he conceived the cosmic structure as a russian doll , in which all elements were contained within larger structures :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ hence may arise new heavens one after the other ; in these heavens , new vortices and mundane [ i.e. planetary ] systems ; in these vortices and systems , new planets ; around the planets , new satellites ( vol .  2",

    "he insisted on the fact that this explanation concerns only the visible aspect of the universe that is accessible to our senses ( i.e. as an optical effect ) , but is not its real structure .",
    "he presented this hypothesis as a possible explanation of what we see in the sky but , as he asserted , ",
    "i do nt mean to affirm that it really is so in fact \" @xcite .",
    "for him , what was really important was to reconcile the real structure of the cosmos with  the visible order of its parts , \" in this case , the observed milky way .",
    "this task was obviously hard to fulfill , since his cosmic model was founded on false grounds and was extremely complex due to mixing physical phenomena with religious elements .",
    "wright failed to outline a correct ( and even reasonable ) structure of the universe , but he did foresee that the solar system , as traditionally argued in the plurality of worlds by then , was not the proper unit to consider regarding the general scale ; instead , it was an element of a larger structure composed of systems with a much bigger size .",
    "these aspects of his hypothesis ( or ` theory ' according to his own terminology ) , although being secondary elements within his worldview , acquire relevance in view of the future development of astronomy .    only five years after the publication of _ an original theory _ by wright , and at the age of 31 , immanuel kant ( 17241804 ) brought out the _ allgemeine naturgeschichte und theorie des himmels _ [ universal natural history and theory of heaven ] @xcite .",
    "contrary to popular opinion , the term ` island universes ' never appears as such in the _ theorie des himmels _ , although the idea behind it has a notable presence .",
    "kant did discuss other systems that are similar to the milky way , and he referred to them using expressions like  similar systems \" ( hnliche systeme ) ,  systemata \" ,  world systems \" ( weltgebuden , weltsystemen ) ,  world orders \" ( weltordnungen ) ,  heavenly hosts\"(himmelsheere ) , or  solar systems \" ( sternensysteme ) .",
    "the word ` island ' ( insel in german ) appears a couple of times in this book , but to refer to a real island ( jamaica ) , or as a metaphor applied to planets without inhabitants .    by the middle of the 18@xmath0 century , when kant published this book , the concept of the plurality of worlds was already well - established and was a common topic of discussion in both specialized and popular literature . in fact , he used the same expressions ( see the terms listed above ) that were usual in this field to designate the structural components of the universe .",
    "but kant went further and gave the best description ( in a contemporary sense ) of the cosmic structure so far .    instead of talking about the concept of island universes , kant defined what he called a  systemic constitution of the universe .",
    "\" in essence , it involved the definition of the components of the universe s structure as ` systems ' : the solar _ system _ was the basic element ; it belonged to the category of planetary _ systems _ , which were associated with the stars seen in the sky ( each star was considered to be a sun , in the sense of forming a planetary system ) ; a group of many planetary _ systems _ , including ours , forms the milky way , which was also defined as a _ system _ ( and described as a plane that constitutes an area of relationships  or  relational area \"  caused by its gravitational forces , in which all elements are rotating round its center and whose general shape is elliptic ) ; finally , the nebulae are also _ systems _ with similar characteristics to the milky way and which are so far away from us that their constitutive heavenly bodies blur themselves in a misty appearance . therefore , kant s worldview was an intermediary step between the plurality of worlds and more modern day conceptions .",
    "he defined our galaxy as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the shape of the heavens of the fixed stars has no other principle than the same system constitution in large that the planetary world - edifice [ i.e. the solar system ] has in small , inasmuch as all suns form a system whose general relational plane is the milky way @xcite . _",

    "he recognized that our galaxy generates an  area of relationships \" which , by virtue of gravitational forces , bunch all the galactic celestial bodies and systems together .",
    "he explained how the gravity generated by the galaxy acts upon the systems belonging to it in a similar way such that the gravity produced by the sun acts upon the celestial bodies of the solar system , and likewise the gravity of the other stars has an effect on the respective planetary systems that they form .    in a third step , he followed wright s hypothesis that nebulae are systems that are similar to the milky way . after explaining some of the characteristics of nebulae",
