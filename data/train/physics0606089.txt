    "nowadays there is a constant interest to use the partially coherent light in optical systems . among the important problems related to partially coherent light are study of light propagation , image formation , pulse shaping , light interaction with nonlinear media , etc .",
    "all of these problems require adequate models of radiation , which should describe its spatial , spectral and statistical properties ; at the same time analytically described models are advantageous . for stationary beams",
    "such model is well - known : it is the shell model @xcite , especially gaussian shell - model ( gsm ) and its generalizations .",
    "pulsed partially coherent beams is also described by various generalizations of the shell - model @xcite , usually with the gaussian profile of temporal dependence of correlation function .    in the present work , another model of partially coherent pulses",
    "is presented .",
    "it is based on the concept of `` hidden coherence '' , introduced recently by picozzi and haelterman @xcite in the framework of parametric wave mixing .",
    "such radiation is completely coherent along some spatio - temporal trajectories in 4d space , but is neither completely spatially nor temporally coherent ( from the point of view of usual interferometric experiments , such as young double - slit interferometer ) . in the other words , wavefields with complex spatio - temporal structure are `` operationally '' equivalent to partially coherent beams @xcite .    as an example",
    ", nonuiform and nonstationary phase shift ( completely deterministic , such as in non - linear self - phase modulation @xcite , or , for relatively large characteristic time intervals  by mechanical motion of lenses , mirrors , or phase screens @xcite ) results in the beam properties , which are typical for partially coherent light  low contrast of interference effects , increase of spectral width and so on  i.e. light becomes effectively non - coherent .    in present paper , a quite a simple model of effectively partially coherent pulses",
    "is studied in framework of coherent mode decomposition , its main properties and limitations of the model are discussed .",
    "a complex field ( analytic signal ) of a light beam cross - section is considered as sum of factorized , mutually orthogonal ( and normalized ) components @xmath0 @xmath1 is amplitude of @xmath2th component .    *",
    "envelopes and modal amplitudes are calculated as eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of dual integral equations where kernels are spatial and temporal correlation functions @xmath3 @xmath4 * decomposition gives optimal representation ( most fast converging expansion ) .",

    "light pulse with the spatially nonuiform and nonstationary phase shift : @xmath10{4\\pi^2 a^2 \\tau^2 } }   \\exp\\left(- \\frac{x^2}{4 a^2 } - \\frac{t^2}{4 \\tau^2 }   + i t\\,x/\\eta",

    "note , that an observer , moving with a constant velocity @xmath18 across the beam , will treat it as fully coherent .",
    "* fully deterministic . * spatio - temporal symmetry . * any degree of coherence . * could be used in quasi-1d ( or @xmath19d ) problems , e.  g. with strip - source illumination .",
    "* disadvantage : * the proposed model requires large phase shifts at beam edges and on pulse rise and fall .    * generation : * using specially designed moving doe ( diffractive optical element ) .",

    "spatial and temporal decomposition functions are already known  hermite - gaussian functions @xmath24 @xmath25 and modal weights @xmath26 where @xmath27 are hermitian polynomials , @xmath28 and @xmath29    number of coherent modes @xmath30",
    "one more disadvantage of the model : difficulty of its generalization to more realistic case of 2d aperture .",
    "it is preferable , that field is rotationally invariant , then use of term like @xmath31 leafs to a phase singularity near @xmath32 .",
    "an alternative variant with @xmath33 does not lead to gaussian shape of spatial correlation function .",
    "moreover , in general , taking into account properties of modal decomposition of 1d ( temporal @xmath34 ) and 2d spatial @xmath35 kernels , it is possible to show , that _ deterministic _ double - gaussian shell - model pulsed beams are impossible .",
