    "the in - plane lattice constant of ( 001)@xmath7 ndgao@xmath0 is 3.865  , which leads to a 1.65% compressive strain to the pseudocubic srruo@xmath0 ( 3.93  ) .",

    "consequently , closing / opening the sr / ru shutters according to the rheed intensity curve can intentionally control the thickness of thin film . in this way",
    ", the thicknesses of all srruo@xmath0 films in this work were well controlled . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1(c ) , the morphology of a typical 4-uc - thick film measured by atomic force microscope illustrates a surface roughness of only 0.13 nm , which guarantees the well - controlled thickness of the ultrathin films and following arpes measurements . the typical x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) of the srruo@xmath0 film is shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath8 - 2@xmath8 scan result is consistent with the growth of phase - pure ( 001)@xmath7-oriented srruo@xmath0 .",
    "the clear kiessig interface fringes indicate the sharp and smooth interfaces between the thin film and substrate .",
    "the scheme of the thickness control could be further confirmed by the explicit fitting of keissig fringes in the xrd pattern@xcite .",
    "for example , the best fit to the @xmath8 - 2@xmath8 scan around the 002 diffraction peak [ fig .",
    "1(d ) ] gives a thickness of 21 uc , which is in good agreement with that determined by counting rheed oscillations .",
    "after growth , the film was cooled down to 200 @xmath17c and then immediately transferred to the arpes chamber within 5 minutes through a transfer chamber bridging the mbe and arpes with a vacuum of around 1.0 @xmath11 @xmath18 torr .",

    "2(a1 ) displays the band dispersion of one typical 14-uc - thick srruo@xmath0 film along the ( 0,0)-(0,@xmath21 ) high symmetry direction ( see the inset ) .",
    "consistent with the previous report@xcite , the quasi-1d band @xmath27 exhibits sharp quasi - particle peaks , indicating that the sample is indeed in the fermi liquid regime .",
    "the overlaid black curve is the exacted dispersion by fitting momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) with lorentzian functions .",
    "it is evident that the slope of the dispersion near @xmath5 is significantly smaller than that of high - binding - energy part ( -0.15 ev to -0.25 ev ) .",
    "such an abrupt change of the slope is the key characteristic of the kink structure signalling significant electron - boson coupling@xcite . as displayed in figs .",
    "2(a1-a6 ) , while the film thickness keeps decreasing , the kink structure persists in the dispersion of the band @xmath27 , and can even be observed in a 4-uc - thick film [ fig .",
    "2(a6 ) ] , aside from the broader background and smaller slope of high - binding energy part partially due to the increasing electron correlations induced by reducing the dimensionality@xcite . for films with less than 4 uc",
    ", the dispersion is too broad to extract the kink structure , while finite spectral weight near the @xmath5 still remains in 2-uc - thick films ( not shown ) .    to identify such kink evolution with dimensionality in an accurate way",
    ", quantitative self - energy analysis was carried out@xcite . here",
    "the self - energy is handled in a practical way , which was proved to be effective in identifying the kink@xcite .",
    "we first fitted the band @xmath27 ( specifically the high binding - energy part ) with a polynomial function with an order of two to approximately yield the bare band dispersion marked by red dotted lines in figs .",
    "2(b1-b6 ) ; consequently , by subtracting the exacted band with the fitted bare band , we can obtain the the real part of the self - energy @xmath22@xmath23(@xmath24 ) , as marked by yellow shadows in fig .",
    "3(a ) illustrates the thickness dependence of @xmath22@xmath23(@xmath24 ) .",
    "each curve evidently shows a maxima which can be used to mark the energy position of the kink .",
    "it is found that the kink structure is always located at around 62 mev below @xmath5 , as highlighted by the gradient cyan shadow .",
    "such a result can be also confirmed by the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath22@xmath26(@xmath24 ) analysis , which is directly related with momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) peak widths [ see fig .",
    "3(b ) ] . as we can see ,",
    "each @xmath22@xmath26(@xmath24 ) curve exhibits a characteristic step - like increase , implying the sudden change of the scattering rate of electrons . with",
    "the decreasing of the film thickness , the step - like feature s characteristic energy remains around 62 mev ( binding energy ) as well , in line with the @xmath22@xmath23(@xmath24 ) analysis .",
    "we can further estimate the kink energy of each film by applying gaussian fitting to the maxima region of the @xmath22@xmath23(@xmath24 ) , given that the maxima region of the @xmath22@xmath23(@xmath24 ) qualitatively adopts the gaussian function shape .",
    "as shown by the left axis of fig .",
    "4a , the kink energy qualitatively remains unchanged with film thickness .",
    "perovskite srruo@xmath0 was reported to host a fundamental thickness limit of the long - range ferromagnetism : the curie temperature t@xmath28 keeps decreasing with thinning the film @xcite , as illustrated by the reproduced data in fig .",
    "4(a ) ( the right axis ) . in a typical itinerant ferromagnet",
    ", the effective exchange interaction @xmath29 is expected to be proportional to the @xmath30 , and thus the energy of spin waves or magnons , which is proportional to the spin wave stiffness @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath29 , would be reduced as the @xmath30 decreasing .",
    "if the kink structure of srruo@xmath0 indeed originates from the electron - magnon coupling , the energy of the kink should have shown an evident downward trend with thinning the film .",
    "however , by contrast , the binding energy of the kink shows negligible thickness dependence as illustrated in fig .",
    "4(a ) ( the left axis ) . in addition , for another two members of ruddlesden - popper ( rp ) series of ruthenates , sr@xmath33ruo@xmath34 and sr@xmath9ru@xmath33o@xmath35 , whose the magnetic ground states are totally different from srruo@xmath0 , the spectral behaviors of the kinks are similar to that of srruo@xmath0@xcite . therefore , we suggest that the collective magnetic excitations may have little contribution to the kink of srruo@xmath0 . alternately , it was proposed that strong electron - electron interaction could solely lead to the formation of a kink in the electron band@xcite as well , which however is not the case of srruo@xmath0 since srruo@xmath0 is known as a moderately correlated without well - separated sub - hubbard bands@xcite .    . ( a ) left axis : measured negligible thickness dependence of the energy position of the kink .",
    "the kink energy is extracted by applying gaussian function fitting to maxima region of the real part of self energy .",
    "right axis : reported thickness dependence of the curie temperature ( ref .",
    "the black rectangular marker displays the energy scale of in - phase stretching phonon mode proposed by the combined studies of raman spectroscopy and calculation ( ref .",
    "( b ) schematic of in - phase stretching phonon mode ( associated with the movement of in - plane oxygen atoms as marked by blue arrows ) ( ref .",
    "36 ) , based on the perovskite structure of srruo@xmath0 which is constituted of oxygen octahedra connected by oxygen atoms ( note that sr atoms are not drawn for simplicity ) . , width=321 ]    on the other hand , the combined study of raman spectroscopy and lattice dynamical calculations revealed that perovskite srruo@xmath0 films possess the prominent in - phase stretching mode in the phonon spectra [ as illustrated in fig .",
    "4(b ) schematically ] , the energy scale of which ( 540@xmath36 67 mev ) is remarkably close to our measured kink s binding energy 62 mev@xcite . besides",
    ", such bonding - stretching phonons with similar energy scale have been well identified as the origin of the kink structure in the band dispersion of rp - structured manganite la@xmath37sr@xmath38mn@xmath2o@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is most probable that the coupling of electrons to the bond - stretching phonons plays a dominant role in the formation of kink in perovskite srruo@xmath0 films .",
    "indeed , since in - plane phonon mainly involves in - plane movements of atoms , its mode energy should not notably change with driving srruo@xmath0 to two - dimensional limit .    as mentioned above , for two other members of rp - structured ruthenates , sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath0ru@xmath2o@xmath4",
    "both show the kink structure with the same binding energy in the band dispersion@xcite . considering their more two - dimensional electronic structure and negligible thickness dependence of kink in perovskite",
    "srruo@xmath0 think films , it is natural to assign these phenomena to the coupling of electrons to the _ in - plane _ stretching phonon branch . moreover ,",
    "such kink structure in the band dispersion was also observed in many other correlated oxides , such as various cuprate superconductors@xcite and srvo@xmath0@xcite . in terms of crystal structure ,",
    "these compounds belong to perovskite and layered perovskite oxide family , which are constituted of oxygen octahedra / tetrahedra connected by oxygen atoms [ see the structure of srruo@xmath0 in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) as an example ] . the vibration of oxygen atoms , together with various tilts and distortions of similar oxygen octahedra would lead to considerable phonon modes .",
    "once such phonon modes couple with electrons , renormalization with cut - off binding energies may occur and scattering rate near the @xmath5 may be changed as well , thus forming a kink in the band dispersion .",
    "thus , we suggest that the interaction between electrons and phonons may be ubiquitous ( in many cases even form a kink in the band dispersion , as discussed above ) and then impact the physical performance of correlated oxides with the transition metal - oxygen octahedra units . particularly , this kind of coupling has also been considered to be important in understanding the the formation of cooper pairs in cuprates@xcite , and the colossal magnetoresistance effect in manganites@xcite .",
    "the studies of electron - phonon coupling in ruthenates may provide opportunities to uncover the roles phonons play in these novel materials .",
    "to summarize , we have utilized the delicate combo of reactive mbe and _ in situ _ arpes to systematically study the kink structure of srruo@xmath0 thin films with various well - controlled thicknesses .",
    "the kink structure exists in all srruo@xmath0 films ( even in 4-uc - thick films ) .",
    "moreover , through quantitative self - energy analysis , we observed that all kinks approximately occur at around 62 mev below the e@xmath25 .",
    "this observation , and comparisons with other oxides , together with reported transport and raman studies , demonstrate that the kink originates from the the strong electron - phonon coupling other than electron - magnon coupling .",
    "in addition , we discussed the possible ubiquity of electron - phonon coupling in correlated oxides .",
    "our work not only uncovers the kink origin of srruo@xmath0 ( for the first time ) and gives a hint on fundamental exploration of other correlated oxides , but also demonstrates that the _ in situ _ mbe and arpes system could be a powerful toolkit in studying novel quantum materials .",

    "<S> perovskite srruo@xmath0  a moderately correlated conductive ferromagnet@xcite  has attained continuous interests . on the application side , it is widely utilized as conductive electrodes due to the good stability and structurally compatibility with other correlated oxides@xcite ; meanwhile , it is explored to be a key integrant in fabricating oxide heterostructures / superlattices@xcite , which may contribute to new functionalities in electronics and spintronics@xcite . from the viewpoint of fundamental studies , srruo@xmath0 is a simple but profound model system to explore how many - body interactions determine the physical properties@xcite , and the underlying mechanism may provide a hint on novel physics of other correlated oxides including the unconventional superconductivity in sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3@xcite and quantum criticality in sr@xmath0ru@xmath2o@xmath4@xcite .    for correlated oxides , </S>",
    "<S> a kink in the low - energy band dispersion reflects the unusual electron dynamics  the scattering rate of electrons has been altered within a narrow energy range  which usually implies the existence of pronounced coupling between electrons and various collective excitations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interpretation of the kink is of significance to understand the essential effects on physical properties of correlated systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there have been lasting and intense debates on whether the kink - like feature discovered in the dispersion of cuprate superconductors stems from spin fluctuations or lattice waves ( phonons ) , which is intimately related with the fundamental understanding of the pairing mechanism of high-@xmath1 superconductivity@xcite . for srruo@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> previous studies have reported a kink - like feature in its band dispersion@xcite , which suggests remarkable renormalization of low - energy electrons by some collective modes . </S>",
    "<S> however , the details of which mode is most relevant , has not been completely explored yet till now .    in this article , we took advantage of the reactive molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) to fabricate a series of high - quality srruo@xmath0 thin films with well - controlled thickness . through tuning the extra knob of dimensionality , we can effectively adjust the ferromagnetism and meanwhile keep the basic crystal structure of films , which is expected to result in the pronounced dichroism between the possible electron - phonon and electron - magnon interactions in films . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we performed a systematic _ in situ _ angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) study of the kink structure to pin down which boson modes are most relevant . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the kink persists in the film as thin as 4 unit cells ( uc ) . through quantitative self - energy analysis , we found that , while the film thickness was progressively reduced , the kink energy remained to be around 62 mev below the fermi level ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this observation , together with reported thickness dependent curie temperature ( @xmath6 ) and raman studies of phonons , suggests that the kink in srruo@xmath0 originates from the the strong electron - phonon coupling , and the collective magnetic excitations may have little contribution . by referring other correlated oxides exhibiting similar kink - like structure </S>",
    "<S> , we infer that the electron - phonon coupling may be ubiquitous in correlated oxides . </S>"
