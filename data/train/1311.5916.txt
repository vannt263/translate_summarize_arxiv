    "recent quantitative studies have yielded richer details on sf dependence on halo mass and environment , probing their relationships at higher redshifts .",
    "for example , using a large group catalog from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 2 , @xcite find that at fixed luminosity the fraction of early - type galaxies increases with increasing halo mass and this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire mass range probed without any break or feature at any mass - scale . from a spectral analysis of galaxies at @xmath6 based on the eso distant cluster survey , @xcite find that the incidence of k+a galaxies increases strongly with increasing velocity dispersion of the environment from groups to clusters . @xcite , examining the sf properties of group and field galaxies from sdss at @xmath7 and from ultraviolet imaging with galex at @xmath8 , find that the fraction of passive galaxies is higher in groups than the field at both redshifts , with the difference between the group and field growing with time and larger at low masses .",

    "@xcite , analyzing galex imaging of a statistically representative sample of 23 galaxy groups at @xmath14 , suggest an average quenching timescale of @xmath15gyr .",
    "@xcite , with deep gmos - s spectroscopy for 11 galaxy groups at @xmath16 , show that the strongest environmental dependence is observed in the fraction of passive galaxies , which make up only @xmath17 per cent of the field in the mass range @xmath18 but are the dominant component of groups . using sdss ( @xmath19 ) and",
    "the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ; @xmath20 ) data , @xcite find a strong environmental dependence of quenching in terms of halo mass and distance to the centrals at both redshifts .",
    "the widespread observational evidence of environment quenching is unsurprising theoretically . in regions of overdensity , whether around a large collapsed halo or unvirialized structure ( e.g. , a zeldovich pancake or a filament ) , gas is gravitationally shock heated when converging flows meet . in regions filled with hot shock - heated gas , multiple gasdynamical processes would occur .",
    "one of the most important gasdynamical processes is ram - pressure stripping of gas , when a galaxy moves through the ambient hot gas at a significant speed , which includes , but is not limited to , the infall velocity of a satellite galaxy .",
    "the theoretical basis for the ram - pressure stripping process is laid down in the seminal work of @xcite .",
    "recent works with detailed simulations of this effect on galaxies ( in non - cosmological settings ) include those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . even in the absence of ram - pressure stripping , ubiquitous supersonic and transonic motions of galaxies of complex acceleration patterns through ambient medium ( intergalactic or circumgalactic medium )",
    "subject them to the raleigh - taylor and richtmyer - meshkov instabilities .",
    "large shear velocities at the interfaces between galaxies and the ambient medium allow the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability to play an important role .",
    "when these processes work in tandem with ram - pressure displacements , the disruptive effects are amplified .",
    "for example , the kh instability time scale is substantially shorter for a non - self - gravitating gas cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) than for one sitting inside a virialized dark matter halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another important process in hot environments is starvation of cold gas that is fuel for sf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in regions with high - temperature and high - entropy cooling of hot gas",
    "is an inefficient process for fueling sf , an important point noted long ago to account for the basic properties ( mass , size ) of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this phenomenon may be understood by considering the dependence of cooling time on the entropy of the gas : the gas cooling time can be written as @xmath21 $ ] @xcite .",
    "it follows that the minimum cooling time of a gas parcel just scales with @xmath22 . as a numerical example , for a gas parcel of entropy @xmath23k  @xmath24 ( say , for temperature @xmath25k and density @xmath26@xmath27 ) and metallicity @xmath28 , its cooling time is no shorter than the hubble time at @xmath29 hence the gas can no longer cool efficiently to fuel sf .",
    "it may be that the combination of cold gas removal and dispersal by ram - pressure stripping , hydrodynamic instabilities , and cold gas starvation , all of which are expected to become increasingly important in more massive environments , plays a primary role in driving the color migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence .",
    "in dense environments , gravitational tidal ( stripping and shock ) effects and relatively close fly - bys between galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also become important . to understand the overall effect on sf quenching by these external processes in the context of the standard cold dark matter model , a realistic cosmological setting is imperative , in order to capture complex external processes that are likely intertwined with large variations of internal properties of galaxies . in this paper",
    "we perform _ ab initio _ * l*arge - scale * a*daptive - mesh - refinement * o*mniscient * z*oom-*i*n cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , called * laozi simulations * , to obtain a large sample of galaxies to , for the first time , perform a chronological and statistical investigation on a very large scale . the large simulated galaxy sample size and very high resolution of laozi simulations provide an unprecedented opportunity to undertake the study presented .",
    "our study shares the spirit of the work by @xcite , who examine the evolution of a dozen galaxies falling onto a forming group of galaxies , with a substantial improvement in the statistical treatment , the simulation resolution , the range of environment probed , and the analysis scope .",
    "feedback from agn is not included in this simulation , partly because of its large uncertainties and present lack of definitive driving sources and primarily due to our intention to focus on external effects .",
    "internal effects due to sf are automatically included and we find no evidence that sf or merger triggered sf plays a primary role in quenching from our study .",

    " 3.4 gives an example of consequences of the found color migration picture - galaxy age - mass relation .",
    "we present observable environmental dependence of galaxy makeup at @xmath2 in  3.5 .",
    "conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "we perform cosmological simulations with the amr eulerian hydro code , enzo @xcite .",
    "first we run a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of @xmath30mpc ( comoving ) on a side .",
    "we identify a region centered on a cluster of mass of @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",
    "we then resimulate with high resolution of the chosen region embedded in the outer @xmath33mpc box to properly take into account the large - scale tidal field and appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of a refined region .",
    "the refined region has a comoving size of @xmath34mpc@xmath35 and represents a @xmath36 matter density fluctuation on that volume .",
    "the dark matter particle mass in the refined region is @xmath37 .",
    "the refined region is surrounded by three layers ( each of @xmath38mpc ) of buffer zones with particle masses successively larger by a factor of @xmath39 for each layer , which then connects with the outer root grid that has a dark matter particle mass @xmath40 times that in the refined region .",
    "we choose the mesh refinement criterion such that the resolution is always smaller than @xmath41pc ( physical ) , corresponding to a maximum mesh refinement level of @xmath42 at @xmath32 .",
    "an identical comparison run that has four times better resolution of @xmath43pc / h was also run down to @xmath44 and some relevant comparisons between the two simulations are made to understand effects of limited resolution on our results .",
    "the simulations include a metagalactic uv background @xcite , and a model for self - shielding of uv radiation @xcite .",
    "they include metallicity - dependent radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "our simulations also solve relevant gas chemistry chains for molecular hydrogen formation @xcite , molecular formation on dust grains @xcite , and metal cooling extended down to @xmath45k @xcite .",
    "star particles are created in cells that satisfy a set of criteria for sf proposed by @xcite .",
    "each star particle is tagged with its initial mass , creation time , and metallicity ; star particles typically have masses of @xmath46@xmath47 .",
    "supernova feedback from sf is modeled following @xcite .",
    "feedback energy and ejected metal - enriched mass are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the star particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell , which is to mimic the physical process of supernova blastwave propagation that tends to channel energy , momentum and mass into the least dense regions ( with the least resistance and cooling ) .",
    "the primary advantages of this supernova energy based feedback mechanism are three - fold .",
    "first , nature does drive winds in this way and energy input is realistic .",
    "second , it has only one free parameter @xmath48 , namely , the fraction of the rest mass energy of stars formed that is deposited as thermal energy on the cell scale at the location of supernovae .",
    "third , the processes are treated physically , obeying their respective conservation laws ( where they apply ) , allowing transport of metals , mass , energy and momentum to be treated self - consistently and taking into account relevant heating / cooling processes at all times .",
    "we allow the entire feedback processes to be hydrodynamically coupled to surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes , such as cooling and heating .",
    "the total amount of explosion kinetic energy from type ii supernovae with a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) is @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the speed of light ) , for an amount @xmath51 of star formed .",
    "taking into account the contribution of prompt type i supernovae ,",
    "we use @xmath52 in our simulations . observations of local starburst galaxies indicate that nearly all of the sf produced kinetic energy is used to power galactic superwinds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "supernova feedback is important primarily for regulating sf and for transporting energy and metals into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the extremely inhomogeneous metal enrichment process demands that both metals and energy ( and momentum ) are correctly modeled so that they are transported in a physically sound ( albeit still approximate at the current resolution ) way .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap7-normalized @xcite @xmath53cdm model : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with those from planck first - year data @xcite if we average planck derived @xmath60 with sn ia and hst based @xmath60 .",
    "we note that the size of the refined region , @xmath34mpc@xmath35 , is still relatively small and the region biased .",
    "this is , of course , designed on purpose .",
    "because of that , however , we are not able to cover all possible environment , such as the center of a void . also because of that",
    ", we have avoided addressing any measures that requires a precise characterization of the abundance of any large galaxy systems , such as the mass function or luminosity function of massive galaxies or groups . despite that , measures that are characterized as a function of environment / system masses should still be valid .",
    "our environment coverage is substantially larger than probed in , for example , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we show that the present simulation box ( c box ) ( run to @xmath32 with a lower resolution previously ) spans a wide range in environment from rich clusters to the field , and there is a substantial overlap in the field environment with another simulation centered on a void ( v box ) .",
    "it is the density peaks higher than we model here ( i.e. , more massive clusters of galaxies ) that we fail to probe . as it should be clear later",
    ", this shortcoming should not affect any of our conclusions , which may be appropriately extrapolated .",
    "we identify galaxies in our high resolution simulations using the hop algorithm @xcite operating on the stellar particles , which is tested to be robust and insensitive to specific choices of concerned parameters within reasonable ranges .",
    "satellites within a galaxy down to mass of @xmath61 are clearly identified separately in most cases .",

    ", we will examine gasdynamic processes , e.g. , cold gas loss or lack of cold gas accretion , under the working hypothesis that ram - pressure stripping and gas starvation are the primary detrimental processes to star formation .",
    "we should assume that other processes , such as hydrodynamical instabilities ( e.g. , rt , kh , tidal shocks , etc ) , may either be  lumped together \" with ram - pressure stripping or play some role to enhance cold gas destruction that is initiated by ram - pressure stripping .",
    "a word on tidal stripping may be instructive .",
    "it is noted that while tidal stripping would affect both stars and gas , ram - pressure operates only on the latter . as one",
    "will see later , in some cases the stellar masses of galaxies decrease with time , which are likely due to tidal effects .",
    "a simple argument suggests that ram - pressure effects are likely to be more far - reaching spatially and are more consistent with the environment effects becoming effective at 2 - 3 virial radii than tidal stripping that we will show later .",
    "let us take a specific example to illustrate this .",
    "let us assume that the primary and infalling galaxies have a velocity dispersion of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , and that they both have isothermal sphere density profiles for both dark matter and baryons .",
    "the virial radius is proportional to its velocity dispersion in each case .",
    "under such a configuration , we find that the tidal radius for the satellite galaxy at its virial radius is equal to the virial radius of the primary galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "the ram - pressure force on the gas in the satellite at its virial radius is already equal to the gravitational restoring by the satellite , when the satellite is ( @xmath75 ) virial radii away from the primary galaxy . in reality , of course , the density profiles for dark matter and baryons are different and neither is isothermal , and the gas may display a varying degree of non - sphericity .",
    "but the relative importance of ram - pressure and tidal strippings is likely to remain the same for relatively diffuse gas .",
    "the relative situation is unchanged , if one allows the gas to cool and condense . as an example",
    ", if the gas within the virial radius of the satellite and the primary galaxies in the above example is allowed to shrink spherically by a factor of 10 in radius ( we will continue to assume that the velocity dispersion or rotation velocity remains flat and at the same amplitude ) , we find that the tidal stripping radius is now a factor of 10 smaller than before ( equal to 0.1 times the virial radius of the primary galaxy ) , while the new ram - pressure stripping radius is @xmath75 times the new tidal stripping radius . as a third example , if the gas within the virial radius of the satellite galaxy in the above example is allowed to shrink spherically by a factor of 10 in radius but the gas in the primary galaxy does not shrink in size , it can be shown that in this case the tidal stripping radius is equal to 0.1 times the virial radius of the primary galaxy , while the new ram - pressure stripping radius is now 0.1 times ( sigma1/sigma2 ) times the virial radius of the primary galaxy .",
    "as the last example , if the gas within the virial radius of the satellite galaxy in the above example is allowed to shrink by a factor of 10 in radius to become a disk but the gas in the primary galaxy does not shrink in size , it can be shown that in this case the tidal stripping radius is equal to 0.1 times the virial radius of the primary galaxy .",
    "the new ram - pressure stripping radius depends on the orientation of the motion vector and the normal of the disk : if the motion vector is normal to the disk , the tidal stripping radius is 0.1 times @xmath75 times the virial radius of the primary galaxy ; if the motion vector is in the plane to the disk , the tidal stripping radius is zero .",

    "we see that the simulated galaxies have a higher abundance than observed by a factor of @xmath140 in the low mass end and the difference increases towards higher mass end .",

    "the outcome that @xmath121 only very weakly anti - correlates with @xmath99 indicates that the onset of quenching is some  threshold \" event , which presumably occurs when the ram - pressure exceeds gravitational restoring force ( i.e. , the threshold ) , thus strongly re - enforcing the observation that ram - pressure is largely responsible for the onset of quenching .",
    "threshold \" type mechanism fits nicely with the fact that the dispersion of @xmath121 at a given @xmath99 is substantially larger than the correlation trend , because galaxies that cross the  threshold \" are expected to depend on very inhomogeneous internal properties among galaxies ( see figure  [ fig : tauminsigma ] below ) .",

    "this is naturally explained as follows .",

    ", the ram - pressure stripping effect may be minimized .",
    "needless to say , given many factors involved , the onset of ram - pressure stripping effect will be multi - variant .",

    "the top - panel of figure  [ fig : tauminsigma ] shows @xmath121 as a function of the stellar surface density @xmath170 within the effective stellar radius @xmath171 .",
    "we see a significant positive correlation between @xmath121 and @xmath170 in the sense that it takes longer to ram - pressure - remove cold gas with higher central surface density ( hence higher gravitational restoring force ) galaxies . while this positive correlation between @xmath121 and @xmath170 is consistent with observational indications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the underlying physical origin is in a sense subtle . since ram - pressure stripping is a",
    " threshold \" event , as noted earlier , when ram - pressure force just exceeds the internal gravitational restoring force , one would have expected that a high surface density would yield a shorter dynamic time hence a shorter @xmath121 .",
    "this is in fact an incorrect interpretation .",
    "rather , the gas in the central regions where @xmath170 is measured is immune to ram - pressure stripping in the vast majority of cases ( see figure ( [ fig : rat ] ) below ) . instead , a higher @xmath170 translates , on average , to a larger scale where gas is removed , which has a longer dynamic time hence a longer @xmath121 .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.5 cm    taken together , we conclude that , while a high ram - pressure provides the conditions for ram - pressure stripping to take effect , the effectiveness or timescale for gas removal by ram - pressure stripping also depend on the internal structure of galaxies .",
    "it is very interesting to note that , unlike between @xmath82 and @xmath170 , @xmath96 ( the time interval between the onset of quenching @xmath82 and the time when the galaxy turns red ) and @xmath170 shown in the bottom - panel of figure  [ fig : tauminsigma ] , if anything , is weakly anti - correlated .",
    "we attribute this outcome to the phenomenon that galaxies with higher central surface density have a shorter time scale for consuming the existing cold gas hence , once the overall cold gas reservoir is removed .",
    "this explanation will be elaborated more later .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.5 cm    -0.0 cm -0.0 cm    we have made the case above that ram - pressure stripping is primarily responsible for the onset of quenching process based on evidence on the dependence of exponential decay time of sfr at the onset of quenching on environment variables .",

    "figure ( [ fig : tqtram ] ) shows the histograms of @xmath172 .",
    "we see that the time difference between the two is centered around zero , indicating a casual connection between the onset of sfr quenching and the rapid rise of ram - pressure .",
    "the width of the distribution of a few hundred myrs reflects the fact that the exact strength of ram - pressure stripping required to dislodge the gas varies greatly , depending on many variables as discussed above .",
    "this is as yet the strongest supporting evidence for ram - pressure stripping being responsible for the onset of quenching , especially considering the conjunctional evidence that the onset of quenching could occur outside the virial radius of a larger neighboring galaxy where tidal stripping is expected to be less effective and yet ram - pressure is expected to become important .",
    "-0.0 cm -1.7 cm -2.15 cm -0.5 cm    evidence so far supports the notion that ram - pressure stripping is the initial driver for the decline of sfr in galaxies that are en route to the red sequence .",
    "the immediate question is then : what region in galaxies does ram - pressure stripping affect ? to answer this question , we need to compare the amount of cold gas available at @xmath82 with the amount of star formation that ocurrs subsequently . we compute the following ratios : the ratios of the amount of stars formed during the time interval from @xmath82 to the time the galaxy turns red ( @xmath77 ) to the difference between the amount of cold ( @xmath173k ) gas at @xmath82 and @xmath77 , denoted as ( @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) within three radii @xmath177kpc .",
    "the minus signs are intended to make the ratios positive , since stellar mass typically increase with time , whereas the cold gas mass for galaxies being quenched decreases .",
    "note that @xmath125 could be negative .",
    "we set a floor value to the above ratios at @xmath26 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : rat ] ) shows the distributions of @xmath178 , where @xmath179 .",
    "we see that for @xmath180kpc the peak of the distribution ( red histograms ) for all stellar masses is at @xmath181 , typically in the range of @xmath182 , with the vast majority of cases at @xmath183 . for a larger radius @xmath184kpc the distribution ( green histograms ) for all stellar masses",
    "is now peaked at @xmath185 with about 50% at @xmath186 , while for a still larger radius @xmath187kpc the distribution ( green histograms ) it is now shifted to @xmath188 and more than 50% at less than @xmath189 for galaxies of stellar mass @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "this is unambiguous evidence that ram - pressure stripping removes the majority of cold gas on scales @xmath191kpc , while the cold gas within @xmath144kpc is unaffected by ram - pressure stripping and consumed by subsequent in situ star formation .",
    "it is noted that the lack of effect on the cold gas at @xmath192kpc by ram - pressure stripping seems universal , the gas removal by ram - pressure stripping at larger radii @xmath193kpc varies substantially from galaxy to galaxy , which we argue is consistent with the large variations of @xmath121 seen in figure  [ fig : tauminsfq ] .",
    "we thus conclude that there is continued nuclear sf in the quenching phase .",
    "@xcite , based on a smaller sample of simulated galaxies that form a group of galaxies with a spatial resolution of @xmath104pc ( compared to @xmath194pc here ) , find that in situ star formation is responsible for consuming a substantial fraction of the residual gas on small scales after gas accretion is stopped subsequent to the infall , consistent with our results .",
    "this outside - in ram - pressure stripping picture and continuous sf in the inner region that emerges from the above analysis has important implications and observable consequences , consistent with the latest observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we quantify how centrally concentrated the star formation is at the outset of sf quenching in figure ( [ fig : r50his ] ) , in part to assess our ability to resolve sf during the quenching phase .",
    "the left panel shows the distribution of the effective radius of stars formed in the last @xmath195myrs prior to @xmath82 , denoted as @xmath196 , for galaxies in two stellar mass ranges .",
    "the right panel shows the distribution of the ratio of the decline of @xmath196 with respect to the decline of sfr , @xmath197 at @xmath82 .",
    "it is evident from figure ( [ fig : r50his ] ) that more massive galaxies tend to have larger @xmath196 , as expected .",
    "it is also evident that the recent formation for the vast majority of galaxies occurs within a radius of a few kiloparsecs .",
    "it is noted that ongoing sf in a significant fraction of galaxies with stellar masses @xmath198 is under - resolved , as indicated by the vertical dot - dashed line in the left panel . however , none of our subsequent conclusions would be much altered by this numerical effect , because ( 1 ) all of our conclusions appear to be universal across the stellar mass ranges and ( 2 ) the inner region of @xmath144kpc is not much affected by ram - pressure stripping anyway ( thus under - resolving a small central fraction within @xmath144kpc does not affect the overall ram - pressure stripping effects ) .",
    "what is interesting is that more than 50% of galaxies in both stellar mass ranges have negative values of @xmath197 at @xmath82 , indicating that , when the sfr decreases in the quenching phase , star formation proceeds at progressively larger radii in the central region .",
    "this result , while maybe somewhat counter - intuitive , is physically understandable .",
    "we attribute this inside - out star formation picture to the star formation rate surface density being a superlinear function of gas surface density in the kennicutt - schmidt @xcite law .",
    "the picture goes as follows : when gas supply from large scales ( @xmath199kpc ) is cut off and under the assumption that gas in the central region does not re - distribute radially , the sfr diminishes faster with decreasing radius in the central region where sf occurs , causing the effective sf radius to increase with time and star formation rate to decline faster than cold gas content , while the overall sfr is declining .    in summary ,",
    "ram - pressure stripping is ineffective in removing cold gas that is already present on scales of @xmath5kpc but most effective in removing less dense gas on larger scales of @xmath191kpc .",
    "the chief role played by ram - pressure stripping appears to disconnect galaxies from their cold reservoir on scales that are much larger the typical stellar radii .",
    "the time scale in question is then on the order of the dynamical time of galaxies at close to the virial radius .",
    "the previous subsection details some of the effects on galaxies being quenched due to gas removal by ram - pressure stripping ( in conjunction with other hydrodynamical processes ) along with consumption by concurrent sf .",
    "our attention is now turned to the subsequent evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : taubrsfq ] plots @xmath96 against four environmental variables at @xmath82 . from all panels",
    "we consistently see the expected trends : the time interval @xmath96 from onset of quenching @xmath82 to turning red @xmath77 , on average , decreases with increasing environmental pressure , increasing environmental entropy , increasing environmental overdensity and decreasing distance to the primary galaxy .",
    "while there is a discernible difference in @xmath96 between satellite galaxies and central galaxies , the difference is substantially smaller than that in the initial exponential decay time scale of sfr @xmath121 ( see figure  [ fig : tauminsfq ] ) .",
    "this observation makes it clear that the onset of quenching initiated by ram - pressure stripping does not determine the overall duration of quenching .",
    "since all the environment variables used tend to broadly correlate with one another - higher density regions tend to have higher temperatures , higher gas entropy and higher pressure - it is not surprising that we see @xmath96 are correlated with all of them in the expected sense .",
    "earlier we have shown that @xmath96 is weakly anti - correlated with the stellar surface density at @xmath200 , @xmath170 ( see bottom - panel of figure  [ fig : tauminsigma ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the overall duration from onset of quenching to turning red is not a matter of a galaxy s ability to hold on to its existing cold gas but rather the extent of the external gas supply condition , i.e. , environment .",
    "this hypothesis is significantly affirmed by noticing that the strongest anti - correlation is found between @xmath96 and @xmath109 , among all environment variables examined .",
    "thus , we conclude , given available evidence , that the eventual ",
    "push \" of galaxies into the red sequence is not as a spectacular event as the initial onset of quenching that is triggered by a cutoff of large - scale gas supply due to ram - pressure stripping , and is essentially the process of gas starvation , when the galaxy has entered a low cold gas density and/or high temperature and/or high velocity dispersion environment .",

    "third , comparing @xmath226gyr to the interval from onset of quenching to the time galaxy turning red of @xmath227gyr , it indicates that , from the onset of quenching to turning red , typical galaxies spend about 25% of the time in the green valley .",

    "figure  [ fig : migrate ] shows the color - stellar mass diagram for 30 semi - randomly selected red galaxies .",

    "one can see easily that the blue tracks are mostly moving from lower left to upper right with time for @xmath228 , indicating that galaxies grow when in the blue cloud . in the blue cloud",
    "it is seen that there are occasional horizontal tracks , representing mergers that maintain overall color .",
    "these are mergers that do not result in red galaxies .",
    "the examples of these include the two most massive galaxies in the plot with final stellar masses of @xmath229 , where there is a major binary merger of @xmath230 at @xmath231 .",
    "there are also cases where the tracks temporarily go from north - west to south - east , indicating significant / major mergers that trigger starbursts that render the remnant galaxies bluer .",

    "\\(1 ) environment quenching is shown to be responsible for making the vast majority , if not all , of red galaxies .",
    "two environmental conditions appear to be necessary in the making of a typical red galaxy : ram - pressure stripping and cold gas starvation .",
    "the ram - pressure stripping disconnects a galaxy from its large - scale cold gas reservoir , while existing cold gas in the central ( @xmath292  kpc ) region is unaffected by ram - pressure but consumed by diminishing sf with an exponential time of several hundred myr . subsequently , gas starvation in the high - velocity environment guards against further significant sf , pushing it through the green valley to the red sequence .",
    "the total duration from the initial sharp drop of sfr to the time of entry into the red sequence is @xmath293gyr ( see eq  [ eq : tqr ] for a fitting formula ) with the median of @xmath211gyr for red galaxies at @xmath2 . we suggest that adopting a spread in quenching time in the semi - analytic modeling may result in an improved treatment in that approach .",
    "\\(2 ) the radius of a galaxy s quenching sphere depends on properties of the infalling galaxy being quenched , causing large variations in the quenching time scales at a given radius and large variations in the quenching radius at a given mass of infalling galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , the vast majority of red galaxies are found to be within three virial radii of a larger galaxy , at the onset of quenching when the specific star formation rate experiences the sharpest decline to fall below @xmath294gyr@xmath4 ( depending on the redshift when it occurs ) .",
    "the exponential decay time of sfr at the onset of quenching is , on average , about a factor of two shorter for events occurring within the virial radius of the quenching galaxy than for those outside the virial radius of the quenching galaxy , which may be evidence of enhanced quenching with the additional aid of tidal stripping when the onset of quenching takes place within the virial radius .",
    "however , it is stressed that the overall duration from the onset of quenching to the time entering the sequence does not depend much on environment .",
    "\\(3 ) not all galaxies in the green valley migrate to the red sequence ; ( 40%,40%,48% ) of green valley galaxies of stellar mass @xmath295 do not proceed to become red galaxies at @xmath2 after having turned green for @xmath15gyrs . for those galaxies that are en route to the red sequence ,",
    "the time spent in the green valley is brief , typically of @xmath104myr .",
    "\\(4 ) throughout the quenching period and the ensuing period in the red sequence galaxies follow nearly vertical tracks in the color - stellar - mass diagram , which correspond most closely to  c tracks \" proposed by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , individual galaxies of all masses grow most of their stellar masses in the blue cloud , prior to the onset of quenching , and progressively more massive blue galaxies with already relatively old mean stellar ages continue to enter the red sequence .",
    "consequently , correlations among observables of red galaxies - such as the age - mass relation - are largely inherited from their blue progenitors .",
    "the age - mass relation of simulated red galaxies is found to be in good agreement with observations .",

    "overall , the excess ( deficit ) of red ( blue ) galaxies occurs within about three virial radii , in good agreement with a wide range of observations .",
    "our detailed examination suggests that the excess of quenched galaxies in progressively denser environment ( groups , clusters , etc ) is , for the most part , a result of quenching _ being more efficient _ , _ not faster _ , on average , in denser environment .",
    "physically , this comes about because most of the time it takes to drive a blue star - forming galaxy to the red sequence is spent during the starvation phase , not the initial gas removal phase by ram - pressure stripping that displays a stronger dependence on environment .",

    "<S> an analysis of more than @xmath0 galaxies resolved at better than @xmath1pc / h at @xmath2 in a  * laozi * \" cosmological adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulation is performed and insights gained on star formation quenching and color migration . </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of red galaxies are found to be within three virial radii of a larger galaxy , at the onset of quenching when the specific star formation rate experiences the sharpest decline to fall below @xmath3gyr@xmath4 ( depending on the redshift ) . </S>",
    "<S> we shall thus call this mechanism  environment quenching \" , which encompasses satellite quenching . </S>",
    "<S> two physical processes are largely responsible : ram - pressure stripping first disconnects the galaxy from the cold gas supply on large scales , followed by a longer period of cold gas starvation taking place in high velocity dispersion environment , during the early part of which the existing dense cold gas in the central region ( @xmath5kpc ) is consumed by _ in situ _ star formation . </S>",
    "<S> quenching is found to be _ more efficient _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. , a larger fraction of galaxies being quenched ) , _ but not faster _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. , duration being weakly dependent on environment ) , on average , in denser environment . throughout this quenching period and </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing one in the red sequence galaxies follow nearly vertical tracks in the color - stellar - mass diagram . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , individual galaxies of all masses grow most of their stellar masses in the blue cloud , prior to the onset of quenching , and progressively more massive blue galaxies _ with already relatively older mean stellar ages _ continue to enter the red sequence . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , correlations among observables of red galaxies - such as the age - mass relation - are largely inherited from their blue progenitors at the onset of quenching . while the color makeup of the entire galaxy population strongly depends on environment , which is a direct result of environment quenching , physical properties of blue galaxies as a sub - population show little dependence on environment . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of predictions from the simulation are shown to be in accord with extant observations .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1 </S>"
