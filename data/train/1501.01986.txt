    "even if the viewing angle is larger than the jet opening angle , off - axis afterglows , called orphan afterglows , can be observed at late times when the relativistic jet slows down and its emission is less beamed .",
    "as the frequency of the peak flux of afterglows decreases with time , at sufficiently small viewing angles the off - axis afterglows in the optical to radio bands can be a good potential candidate of electromagnetic counterparts to gw events  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the grb beamed emission and its late more isotropic orphan afterglow , electromagnetic waves will be emitted quasi isotropically at different stages from material that is ejected during the merger .",
    "most notable one is a macronova ( also called kilonova ) , an optical  infrared transient driven by the radioactive decay of the heavy nuclei synthesized in the ejecta  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the _ hubble space telescope _ detected a near infrared bump at 9  days after the _ swift _ short grb 130603b  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is consistent with the theoretical expectation of macronovae . while the identification hinges on a single data point if correct this is the first observational evidence for a significant mass ejection with a high velocity from a ns@xmath2 merger .",

    "depend on the density of the ism surrounding the merger but for modest densities the radio signals can be observed up to the detector horizon  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that mass ejection from mergers is driven by several different processes .",
    "the most robust one , that appears in numerical merger simulations , is the dynamical mass ejection .",
    "if mergers are accompanied by grbs then clearly relativistic grb jets are another component .",
    "other mass ejection mechanisms that have been proposed are merger shock - breakout material , viscous / neutrino / magnetically driven winds , and a possible cocoon that forms when the jet propagates within the other components of the ejecta .",
    "the different components have different masses and kinetic energies .",
    "their characteristics depend on the nature of the progenitors , in particular on their relative sizes , on the nature of the merger remnant , which could be either a black hole or a massive neutron star  ( mns ) , as well on the , unknown yet , neutron star matter equation of state ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the different components will interact with each other and these interactions will affect their dynamics  @xcite , possibly producing electromagnetic signatures ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in this paper",

    "one of the strongest sources of the uncertainties arises from lack of precise estimates of the mass and energy of the different components . to demonstrate the possible variability of the light curves with these unknown parameters , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the dependence of the radio flares on the kinetic energy of the different components .",
    "here we show the light curves of the fiducial model  ( thick curves ) and those with kinetic energies larger and smaller by a factor of 3  ( thin curves ) than those of the fiducial model . above  ( below ) the self - absorption frequency",
    ", the amplitude of the light curves scales as @xmath157  ( @xmath158 ) and the timescale of the light curves behaves as @xmath159  ( @xmath160 ) as expected ( see sec .  [ sec : mild ] ) .    while the overall peak luminosity and peak flux depend mostly on the global properties of the outflow component , the details depend also on the spatial distribution and on the velocity distribution .",
    "for instance , the light curve of an off - axis jet rises steeply because of the collimation of the jet and relativistic beaming effect .",
    "the detailed shapes of this rise will depend on the angular structure of the jet .",
    "the light curves of the spherical components rise slowly compared to that of off - axis afterglows .",
    "the slope of the light curve depends on the velocity distribution @xmath161 .",
    "the rise of light curves will be shallower for lower values of @xmath60 .",
    "examination of the numerical simulations reveals that the mildly and sub - relativistic components that we have examined do not satisfy indeed the spherical symmetry assumption that we have made here .",
    "@xcite have estimated the effects of a - sphericity on the emission , focusing on the dynamical ejecta .",
    "they found that , for a given total mass , energy , and external density , a - sphericity typically delays the peak emission and reduces the peak flux .",
    "this can be understood intuitively as follows .",
    "if more mass and energy are concentrated in one direction the matter propagating in that direction will slow down later .",
    "this longer deceleration time results in a longer and weaker radio flare compared with the isotropic one .",
    "note that , however , as the outflow is only mildly relativistic , even from a highly a - spherical ejecta , the emission will be roughly isotropic and viewing angle effects will be small .",
    "it is worth noting that the effect of a - sphericity is more relevant for black hole neutron star mergers , which can result in highly a - spherical mass ejection ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "while the macronova identification is based only on one observed data point in the @xmath169-band at about @xmath170  days  ( in source frame ) after the burst , this is the first , even though rather weak , evidence of the significant mass ejection from a ns@xmath171 . using this data point",
    ", one can estimate , from the observed luminosity of the macronova , the minimal ejecta mass as @xmath172  @xcite , where @xmath173 is the conversion efficiency from the total energy generated by radioactive decay into the thermal energy of the ejecta .",
    "the velocity can be also estimated as @xmath174 from the condition that radiation can diffuse out from the ejecta with a mass @xmath175 and an opacity of @xmath176 @xcite at about @xmath170  days after the burst .",
    "assuming that the ejecta mass and average velocity is @xmath177 and @xmath178 , the estimated kinetic energy is about @xmath12  erg .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the expected radio flares from the dynamical ejecta at 150mhz , 1.4  ghz , and 6.7  ghz as well as the observed early radio afterglow of grb 130603b at 6.7  ghz by the vla  @xcite .",
    "here we also show a grb afterglow light curve which is obtained with parameters @xmath179  erg , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "the light curve is consistent with the observed data points and upper limits - band  ( the macronova candidate ) and in the x - ray band . ] within a factor of 2 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the parameters can change by orders of magnitude and still fit the data .",
    "for instance , the external density lies in the range @xmath180  ",
    "@xmath181  @xcite . for modeling the radio flare from the dynamical ejecta , we assume an external density to be @xmath182 and @xmath167 and we use an ejecta mass @xmath183 and a kinetic energy @xmath184  erg .",
    "the predicted dynamical ejecta light curves at 6.7  ghz are well below the upper limits @xmath185 at @xmath186 days .",
    "however , later observations may detect a signal .",
    "specifically the peak flux at 1.4  ghz can be as high as @xmath187 ( depending on the external density ) .",
    "the expected sensitivity of the evla at 1.4  ghz is also shown in the figure .",
    "for the higher range of external densities @xmath188 , the radio flare might be detectable with the evla .",
    "the signal at 150  mhz can be @xmath189 , which might be also detectable with the lofar . a positive detection of a varying radio signal will confirm the identification of this event as a ns@xmath2 merger and will establish the observed infrared bump as a macronova .",
    "a ns@xmath2 merger ejects a significant amount of mass in several different components : a dynamical ejecta , a shock - breakout material , a wind from a black hole / neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk , and a relativistic jet , producing a grb . as a result of the interaction of the relativistic jet with the earlier and slower ejecta along the rotational axis",
    ", a cocoon is expected to be formed and expands nearly spherically . among the different components of the ejecta , the dynamical ejecta , which is also the most robustly found in numerical simulations , has the largest amount of kinetic energy up to @xmath190  erg .",
    "this is comparable to the `` isotropic equivalent '' energy of the highly beamed grb jet .",
    "somewhat surprisingly the beamed grb jet is among the least energetic .",
    "overall we have three important distinct components , the dynamical ejecta , which is mostly sub - relativistic , the mildly relativistic shock - breakout material and cocoon ,  erg . ] and the ultra - relativistic beamed jet .",
    "we have calculated the expected radio signals produced via synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated in the shocks formed between the different components of the ejecta and the ism .",
    "this would be a low frequency ( as opposed to the x - ray or optical grb afterglow or the optical  infrared macronova ) electromagnetic counterpart of the gw event .",
    "this process is similar to grb afterglows and radio emission of some early supernova remnants .",
    "in contrast with the high frequency counterparts , this emission lasts much longer and may even peak a few years after the merger .",
    "we focused on the expected radio flux at two frequencies of 150  mhz and 1.4  ghz .",
    "we found that there are three types of the radio flares : ( i ) the ultra - relativistic jet produces the earliest bright radio flare with a timescale of @xmath191  days for an observer along the jet axis or close to it .",
    "( ii ) a radio flare with a timescale of a few dozen days is produced by the mildly relativistic components such as the shock - breakout material , the off - axis jet , and the cocoon .",
    "the latter flare from the cocoon is significant only when the cocoon is energetic enough so that it has a relativistic velocity .",
    "( iii ) finally the sub - relativistic dynamical ejecta produces a radio flare with a timescale of a few years . at 150  mhz , however , the radio flare is strongly suppressed by synchrotron self absorption for @xmath192 until a few months .",
    "hence the earlier signals are much weaker at low frequencies .",
    "depending on the external density and the distance to the source , these radio flares could be detectable as gw counterparts .",
    "such a detection can reveal the nature of ns@xmath171 mergers .",
    "although the modeling of radio emission from mergers contains uncertain parameters such as the kinetic energy of the ejecta and the external density , it is worth to estimate these values from the nature of the short grb 130603b .",
    "the detection of a macronova candidate associated with this event allows us to estimate the ejecta mass @xmath172 . assuming the velocity of the ejecta is @xmath193 , the estimated kinetic energy is about @xmath12  erg .",
    "the detection of the afterglows implies that the external density is in the range of @xmath180  ",
    "@xmath181  @xcite .",
    "the radio afterglow of grb 130603b , that arose from the relativistic jet , decayed quickly and it was below @xmath194 at @xmath195 days with a similar upper limit at 80  days .",
    "however it is still possible to observe the late - long lasting radio signal arising from the dynamical ejecta . this signal could be as high as @xmath196 at 1.4  ghz depending mostly on the external density .",
    "for the higher range of external densities @xmath188 , this would be detectable at 1.4  ghz with the evla . at 150  mhz ,",
    "the expected flux is about @xmath197 , which depends weakly on the external density and peaks at late times",
