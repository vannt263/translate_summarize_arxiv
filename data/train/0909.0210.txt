    "the multifractal properties of local dimensions of fractal measures have been studied for more than twenty years . some problems",
    "are already completely solved ( for example , the local dimension spectra for gibbs measures on a conformal repeller , see @xcite ) .",
    "however non - conformal systems turn out to be much less tractable and only some specific examples have been solved .    by the local dimension spectrum of a measure we mean",
    "the function @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the set of all points with local dimension @xmath2 .",
    "there exists a well - developed technique for calculating the local dimension spectra of invariant measures for dynamical systems .",
    "one begins by introducing a symbolic description on the attractor and defining a suitable _ symbolic _ local dimension of the measure .",
    "the first step is usually first to compute the multifractal spectrum for the symbolic local dimension .",
    "this is done by constructing a suitable auxiliary measure which is exact - dimensional and only supported on the set of points where the symbolic local dimension of the original measure takes a prescribed value , say @xmath2 .",
    "if the auxiliary measure has been correctly chosen then the hausdorff dimension of points with symbolic local dimension @xmath2 will be the dimension of the auxiliary measure .",
    "the final step is to show that the multifractal spectrum for the symbolic local dimension of the original measure is the same as the spectrum for the real local dimension .",
    "once again , we refer the reader to @xcite , where this technique is explained in detail .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the local dimension spectra for bernoulli measures on bedford - mcmullen carpets .",
    "this problem has already been studied in several papers .",
    "king calculated the symbolic local dimension spectrum in @xcite , this result was then generalized to gibbs measures by barral and mensi @xcite and to higher dimensional generalized sierpiski carpets by olsen @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , in all those papers authors were unable to make the last step , from symbolic to real local dimension .",
    "for that reason , these papers had to assume some strong additional assumptions ( e.g. a very strong separation property ) guaranteeing the equality of symbolic and real local dimension spectra .",
    "however in @xcite it is shown the symbolic and real local dimension spectra are the same for the decreasing part of the spectrum .",
    "naturally , it was conjectured ( for example by olsen in @xcite ) that these additional assumptions are not necessary for the increasing part of the spectra also to be the same .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present this missing argument .",
    "unfortunately our arguments only apply to the two - dimensional case . for simplicity",
    "we just look at the bernoulli measures studied in @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to formally state our results . to define the bedford - mcmullen carpets",
    "@xcite we introduce a digit set @xmath3 where @xmath4 . for each @xmath5",
    "we define @xmath6 by @xmath7 .",
    "we let @xmath8 be the unique non - empty compact set which satisfies @xmath9",
    ". we will also let @xmath10 .",
    "the hausdorff and box counting dimension of @xmath8 were calculated by mcmullen and bedford in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we introduce a positive probability vector @xmath11 with element @xmath12 for each @xmath5 .",
    "we also define the related probability vector @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "thus we can define a self - affine measure @xmath15 which is the unique probability measure satisfying @xmath16 for any borel subset of @xmath17 . for any @xmath18 the local dimension of @xmath15 at @xmath19",
    "is defined by @xmath20 if this limit exists .",
    "for @xmath21 the level sets @xmath1 are defined by @xmath22 in king @xcite the function @xmath23 was calculated under the condition that for any pair @xmath24 we have that @xmath25 and if @xmath26 then @xmath27 . in @xcite",
    "this assumption is weakened : they are also able to allow digit sets @xmath28 where @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore arbitrary digit sets can be considered as long as the probability vector @xmath31 is chosen so that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 .",
    "we will only assume that the digit set has elements in more than one row and more than one column , without this assumption the measure @xmath15 is effectively a self - similar measure on the line and the singularity spectrum is computed in @xcite .",
    "the formula we obtain for @xmath34 is exactly the formula obtained in @xcite . to recall the definition we fix @xmath33 and let @xmath35 .",
    "we then define @xmath36 to be the unique solution to @xmath37 we will let @xmath38 and @xmath39 our main result is that    [ main ] for any @xmath40 we have that @xmath41 in other words @xmath42 is the legendre transform of @xmath43 . furthermore @xmath42 is differentiable with respect to @xmath2 and is concave .     where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the endpoints of the graph are @xmath47 and @xmath48.,width=288,height=288 ]    we are not going to rewrite all of the king s paper @xcite , so we will frequently make use of his partial results , referring the reader to his paper . in particular",
    ", the properties of @xmath49 can be found in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "the rest of paper is divided as follows . in section [ lb ]",
    "we will show how to obtain the lower bound for arbitrarily digit sets . the main argument , calculating of the upper bound ,",
    "is presented in section [ ub ] .",
    "the lower bound we need was obtained by barral and mensi in @xcite however for completeness we give a proof here . the lower bound",
    "can be proved following the method of king , @xcite , with the addition of just one simple lemma .",
    "first of all we need to introduce of a natural symbolic coding . if we let @xmath50 it is possible to define a natural projection @xmath51 .",
    "initially we let @xmath52 be defined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 by @xmath55 .",
    "this allows us to define @xmath56 by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the @xmath59-th element of the sequence @xmath60 .",
    "it is usual in the study of self - similar sets or conformal systems to study cylinder sets . in this self - affine",
    "setting there is a related idea of approximate squares . to construct them we let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be defined by @xmath53 and @xmath55 . for @xmath63",
    "we let @xmath64 $ ] ( where @xmath65 $ ] denotes the integer part ) . for @xmath66",
    "we define @xmath67 \\times   \\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\pi(i_j)m^{-j } , \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\pi(i_j)m^{-j}+m^{-k}\\right ]       .\\ ] ] the shorter side of @xmath68 is always of length @xmath69 .",
    "as the ratio between the sides of this rectangle is clearly between @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we can let @xmath72 and note that for all @xmath73 we have that @xmath74 .",
    "an approximate square @xmath68 can contain elements @xmath75 where @xmath76 . to help keep track of these elements",
    "we denote the set of their possible initial segments of symbolic expansions : @xmath77    for each @xmath73 we will define @xmath78 if this limit exists . under the separation conditions imposed in @xcite if @xmath79 then @xmath80 as long as one of these two limits exists . however without these assumptions this is not always the case .",
    "the following lemma shows that in terms of calculating the lower bound this poses no problem .",
    "we fix @xmath81 and let @xmath82 be the bernoulli measure defined by the probability vector @xmath83 where for @xmath5 @xmath84 we also let @xmath85 and @xmath86    for @xmath87 almost all @xmath60 we have that @xmath88    the fact that @xmath89 for @xmath87 almost all @xmath60 follows from lemma 4 of @xcite ( in the formula given for @xmath90 in lemma 5 in @xcite @xmath91 should read @xmath92 ) .",
    "thus we only need to show that @xmath93 for @xmath87 almost all @xmath60 .",
    "we let @xmath94 and note that by the borel - cantelli lemma @xmath95 for @xmath87 almost all @xmath60 ( here we use the assumption that the digit set has elements in two distinct rows and two distinct columns ) .",
    "we now fix @xmath73 such that @xmath96 and let @xmath97 .",
    "we have that for any @xmath98 @xmath99 the result now follows by considering @xmath98 sufficiently large .    we can now conclude that @xmath100 however in @xcite it is shown in lemma 5 that @xmath101 and that @xmath102 .",
    "technically this result in king is proved with additional assumptions about @xmath28 however the formula for the dimension of a bernoulli measure is still valid without these assumption ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we can now deduce that @xmath103 and the proof of the lower bound is complete .",
    "in this section we will find efficient coverings of @xmath1 by considering appropriate sets of approximate squares .",
    "in particular we want to show that @xmath104 for any @xmath105 .",
    "combining this with the lower bound completes the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "we will fix @xmath105 for the rest of this section . for any @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    "we will denote @xmath108 for a sequence @xmath73 we will define @xmath109 this function will be used to bound the distance between @xmath19 and the horizontal boundary of @xmath68 .        fix @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath110 then we can find @xmath119 such that if @xmath120 we have that @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "we choose @xmath98 such that @xmath122 and let @xmath111 satisfy @xmath123 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath124 .",
    "furthermore there are at most @xmath125 sequences @xmath126 where @xmath127 which means that one of these sequences @xmath126 must satisfy @xmath128 .",
    "parts 1 and 2 of the assertion now follow easily .",
    "this means that any @xmath66 which satisfies @xmath131 must also satisfy @xmath118 hence the ball @xmath132 satisfying @xmath133 must be contained in the union of two approximate squares @xmath134 which both satisfy @xmath135 .",
    "this implies that one of these approximate squares has measure not smaller than @xmath136 .",
    "this together with the upper bound proved for the measure in part ( 2 ) means that one of these approximate squares is contained in @xmath137 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "it should be noted that while this lemma indicates that @xmath138 this would not provide an efficient cover in terms of hausdorff dimension . to get the efficient cover we define",
    "a function @xmath139 by        @xmath143 @xmath144 is essentially the logarithm of the function @xmath145 defined on page 6 of @xcite .",
    "the upper bound in @xcite uses covering of approximate squares , @xmath68 , where @xmath146 for some small @xmath147 .",
    "more precisely for any @xmath107 we let @xmath148 and note that in @xcite it is shown that for any @xmath73 where @xmath149 , there exist infinitely many @xmath98 such that @xmath150 .",
    "we are going to show that these covers can be modified so that the result holds for any @xmath151 even if @xmath152 with @xmath153 does not satisfy @xmath149 . to be able to do this",
    "we need the following proposition :            if we fix @xmath63 , @xmath60 and write @xmath159 then @xmath160 however for any @xmath161 we have that @xmath162 .",
    "thus since @xmath163 we have that for @xmath161 @xmath164 to complete the proof simply note that @xmath165 is uniformly bounded by some constant @xmath166 and thus it is enough to choose @xmath98 large enough so that @xmath167 .",
    "we now choose @xmath107 . as @xmath172",
    ", we have @xmath173 . for any @xmath174 and @xmath113",
    "we have that by using the definition of @xmath175 , using lemma [ cylinder ] and applying the multinomial theorem @xmath176 ( where @xmath177 ) .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath178 and @xmath179 can be arbitrarily small .",
    "we start with the case where @xmath73 , @xmath180 and for some @xmath98 , @xmath181 .",
    "we assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath182 for all @xmath183 and that @xmath184 and let @xmath107 . if we fix @xmath185 and consider @xmath186 level approximate squares @xmath187 which have points within @xmath188 of @xmath19 then @xmath59 must satisfy @xmath189 for all @xmath190 or @xmath191 for all @xmath192 . in both of these cases if @xmath193 is sufficiently large then @xmath194 ( @xmath195 is a converging sequence at such points ) .",
    "it follows from parts 1 and 2 of lemma [ close ] that if @xmath193 is sufficiently large one of these sequences @xmath59 must satisfy that @xmath196 .",
    "let @xmath107 and @xmath73 such that @xmath197 for all @xmath60 .",
    "it is possible to find bounds @xmath201 such that @xmath202 .",
    "we now prove the assertion by contradiction .",
    "assuming @xmath60 does not satisfy the assertion , we can find @xmath113 such that for all @xmath114 we have that @xmath203 or @xmath204 .",
    "firstly let us consider how large @xmath205 can be . by definition",
    ", @xmath206 is the sequence of birkhoff averages for the locally constant function @xmath207 .",
    "since we have that @xmath208 is constant and equal to @xmath209 for @xmath210 , we have                1 .",
    "if @xmath224 then the procedure terminates and we let @xmath225 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath226}<-\\epsilon$ ] then let @xmath227 $ ] and note that @xmath228 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath226}\\geq-\\epsilon$ ]",
    "then since @xmath229 we know that @xmath230}(\\underline{i})>0 $ ] .",
    "we let @xmath231:v_{\\eta}(\\underline{i})=0\\}\\text { and } b=\\max\\{\\eta\\leq [ \\sigma n_j]:v_{\\eta}(\\underline{i})=0\\}.\\ ] ] now choose @xmath232 since we have that @xmath208 is constant for @xmath233 it follows that @xmath206 is monotonic for @xmath234 . hence at either @xmath235 or @xmath236 the value of @xmath237 is going to be not greater than @xmath238}(\\underline{i})$ ] .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath239 .",
    "moreover implies that @xmath240 .",
    "we now have a sequence @xmath241 such that for each @xmath222 where @xmath242 we have that @xmath243 and @xmath244 . as @xmath245 and @xmath246",
    ", it follows that @xmath247 and we can bound @xmath248 this contradicts the definition of @xmath249 .",
    "we now fix @xmath151 and let @xmath73 satisfy @xmath79 .",
