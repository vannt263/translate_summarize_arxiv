    "the presence of multipartite entanglement in the deutsch - jozsa algorithm and in the initial step of the grover algorithm was pointed out recently @xcite . moreover ,",
    "multipartite entanglement was shown to be present at each computational step in grover s algorithm and a scale invariance property of entanglement dynamics was proved @xcite . lately , the notion of quantum hypergraph states was put forward and their link to states employed in the deutsch - jozsa and grover algorithms was proved @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the initial states employed in the grover algorithm for a small number of searched solutions , study their entanglement content ( in terms of the geometric measure of entanglement ) and show the explicit connection to hypergraph states .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ s2 ] we review the notion of multi - qubit real equally weighted states and their link to hypergraphs . in sect .",
    "[ s3 ] we consider the grover algorithm and analyse the entanglement content of the corresponding states in the initial step of the algorithm for different numbers of solutions .",
    "we derive the hypergraphs underlying these symmetric initial states for one and two solutions in sect .",
    "[ s4 ] , and we finally summarise the main results in sect .",
    "the @xmath0-qubit register employed in the deutsch - jozsa @xcite and in the grover @xcite algorithms is initially prepared in state @xmath1 which corresponds to the equally weighted superposition of all possible @xmath2 states @xmath3 in the computational basis . the next step in both algorithms",
    "consists in applying a unitary transformation @xmath4 which generates the state @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath7 boolean function that needs to be evaluated in the considered algorithm .",
    "notice that @xmath8 is just a real phase factor .",
    "the above states are referred to as multi - qubit `` real equally weighted states '' ( rew ) @xmath9 .",
    "the rew states were recently linked to hypergraphs and the set of rew states was proved to be the same as the one of quantum hypergraph states @xcite .",
    "a quantum hypergraph state is defined as follows .",
    "a hypergraph @xmath10 is a set of @xmath0 vertices @xmath11 with a set of hyperedges @xmath12 of any order @xmath13 ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath0 ( a hyperedge of order @xmath13 connects a set of @xmath13 vertices ) .",
    "given a mathematical hypergraph , the corresponding quantum state can be found by following the three steps : assign to each vertex a qubit and initialise each qubit as @xmath15 ( the total initial state is then denoted by @xmath16 ) . wherever there is a hyperedge ,",
    "perform a controlled-@xmath17 operation between all connected qubits . formally ,",
    "if the qubits @xmath18 are connected by a @xmath13-hyperedge , then perform the operation @xmath19 .",
    "the gate @xmath19 introduces a minus sign to the input state @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 , and leaves all the other components of the computational basis unchanged . in this way we get the quantum state @xmath22 where @xmath23 means that the @xmath13 vertices are connected by a @xmath13-hyperedge . notice that the product concerning the index @xmath24 accounts for different types of hyperedges in the hypergraph .",
    "we remind the reader that the well known graph states constitute a subset of quantum hypergraph states : they correspond to ordinary graphs , namely hypergraphs with all hyperedges being of order @xmath25 . in the following sections we will discuss some explicit examples of hypergraph states that appear in grover s algorithm .",
    "in this section we focus on the case of grover s algorithm .",
    "the state ( [ psif ] ) is achieved after the first application of the oracle . in this case",
    "the function @xmath26 has output 1 for entries @xmath27 that correspond to solutions of the search problem and output 0 for values of @xmath27 that are not solutions .",
    "we denote with @xmath28 the number of solutions , which typically is much smaller than the total number of entries @xmath2 .",
    "we will now study the entanglement properties of states ( [ psif ] ) as functions of the number of qubits @xmath0 for a fixed small number of solutions , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "we will quantify the amount of entanglement by the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite , which for a pure @xmath0-partite state @xmath30 reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the set of @xmath33-separable states , i.e. states that are separable with respect to @xmath33 partitions .",
    "notice that @xmath34 quantifies the amount of entanglement of any kind contained in the global system , i.e. it is non - vanishing even for states showing entanglement just between two subsystems , while @xmath35 quantifies genuine multipartite entanglement . in the paper",
    "we will compute @xmath34 .",
    "we first review the case of a single solution to the search problem ( @xmath36 ) , considered in @xcite . without loss of generality , as will be proved later , we consider the state representing the solution to be invariant under any permutation of the @xmath0 qubits ( e.g. @xmath37 ) . therefore , the state @xmath38 after the oracle call , is also permutation invariant .",
    "we first compute @xmath34 for this set of states , as a function of the number of qubits @xmath0 . due to the symmetry property , the search for the maximum in eq . can be restricted to symmetric separable states @xmath39 @xcite , so that the maximisation involves only the two parameters @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] that define the single qubit state @xmath42 .",
    "the geometric measure of entanglement @xmath34 for @xmath36 , i.e. for one solution of the search algorithm , thus reads @xmath43 the optimal value of @xmath44 can be shown to be zero by induction over the number @xmath0 of qubits , while the optimal @xmath45 can be determined by explicitly calculating the derivative of the overlap , and then finding the root of a polynomial in @xmath46 .    in fig .",

    "we introduce a classification of these states based on the hamming distance @xmath49 between the two computational basis states representing the solutions .",
    "we will show that the entanglement properties of the regarded states depend crucially on the number of digits in which the two solutions differ , i.e. on their hamming distance @xmath49 .    without loss of generality , as will be proved below , we consider first the case in which the two @xmath0-qubit states representing the solutions differ in the first @xmath49 digits and are invariant under permutations of the first @xmath49 and last @xmath58 qubits , respectively ( e.g. @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "we first compute @xmath34 for this set of states , as a function of @xmath0 . due to the permutation invariance property",
    ", the search for the closest separable state , appearing in the geometric measure of entanglement , can still be restricted to separable states that show the same symmetry @xcite , i.e. @xmath61 . therefore the maximisation involves only the four parameters @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] that define the two single qubit states @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    the geometric measure of entanglement @xmath34 for two solutions with hamming distance @xmath49 then takes the form @xmath66 notice that when @xmath67 the maximisation procedure involves only two parameters : in this case the state is completely invariant under any permutation of the qubits , and thus only two parameters are needed .    as before ,",
    "the optimal parameters @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be computed by maximising the squared overlap numerically .",
    "the corresponding results are reported in fig .",
    "[ entm ] ( right ) , where the geometric measure of entanglement is plotted versus the number of qubits @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the state of two qubits is always separable for @xmath57 and that @xmath48 for three qubits collapses to the single value @xmath70 . as in the case @xmath36",
    ", we can see that @xmath34 approaches zero exponentially fast for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour holds for any finite value of the hamming distance @xmath49 .",
    "notice also that for fixed finite number of qubits @xmath0 the hamming distance plays a crucial role for the amount of entanglement , since states with two solutions with higher distance @xmath49 exhibit a higher amount of entanglement .",
    "finally , notice that all the results presented so far , even if they were explicitly derived for partially permutation invariant states , hold for any grover search algorithm with two searched items .",
    "actually , analogously to the case of a single solution discussed above , also for @xmath57 all these states with fixed hamming distance @xmath49 can be reached from a partially symmetric one by applying tensor products of @xmath54 pauli operators and identity operators @xmath55 and/or permutations of the @xmath0 qubits . as for the single solution case ,",
    "since these operations are local , they do not change the entanglement content of the resulting state .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ s2 ] all the above states are rew states and therefore they correspond to hypergraphs . in the next section",
    "we show how to relate states with @xmath29 to hypergraphs .",
    "quantum hypergraph states , as reviewed in sect . [ s2 ] , allow us to describe the initial states employed in the grover algorithm in a very convenient way . indeed",
    ", entanglement properties and the gates ( of the @xmath71 type ) that we explicitly need in order to generate them from the separable state @xmath16 emerge very naturally from their hypergraph structure .",
    "consider first the initial symmetric state @xmath38 ( with a minus sign in front of the component @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that it corresponds to the hypergraph with the unique hyperedge of order @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it has a very simple structure in the light of hypergraphs , showing clearly the presence of multipartite entanglement .",
    "in order to discuss the case with two minus signs , we first notice that the hyperedge of order @xmath0 will never appear now . hence , even though states @xmath72 might have a much more complicated hypergraph structure than @xmath38 , the gate @xmath73 will never be involved .",
    "this is because the state @xmath72 has an even number of minuses , while any product of @xmath74 operators involving the gate @xmath73 is diagonal in the computational basis with an odd number of minus signs .",
    "we now discuss the general rule to find the hypergraph associated to the initial symmetric state @xmath72 with general hamming distance @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the two states with negative sign , then the hypergraph associated to @xmath72 can be derived as follows : group the last @xmath58 vertices with a hyperedge of order @xmath58 .",
    "then , connect the whole group to the remaining @xmath49 vertices in any possible way , namely by exploiting hyperedges of any order greater than @xmath58 except the hyperedge of order @xmath0 .",
    "the above procedure is needed because , after we have generated the desired minus signs in front the two components @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we then have to correct the undesired by - product minuses in front of the other components that contain states @xmath78 for all the last @xmath58 qubits .",
    "notice that both the extreme cases @xmath50 and @xmath67 fit into this scheme . regarding the former , since we are not allowed to draw the hyperedge of order @xmath0 , we only group the last @xmath79 vertices without connecting them to the remaining one .",
    "the biseparability of the state then follows trivially . for the latter",
    ", we do not apply the first step of the procedure above , but we connect all possible vertices according to the second step . notice that , in order to derive the hypergraph corresponding to @xmath72 with @xmath67 , we have to recast @xmath72 into the hypergraph state with a plus sign in front of @xmath80 , by multiplying all amplitudes by a factor @xmath81 . as an example , the hypergraphs associated to the four - qubit symmetric states @xmath72 with hamming distance @xmath82 and @xmath83 are shown in fig .",

    "the hamming distance between the items is found to play a crucial role with respect to the entanglement content : for a fixed number of qubits the state turns out to be more entangled for a larger hamming distance .",
    "the connection with quantum hypergraph states has then been worked out , showing the mathematical hypergraphs associated to symmetric initial states with one or two solutions .",
