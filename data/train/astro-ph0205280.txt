    "the binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 resides in the strong gravitational field of its companion . as a result ,",
    "a wide variety of relativistic phenomena are observable , including advance of periastron , gravitational redshift , and , most notably , orbital decay due to gravitational radiation emission ( taylor & weisberg 1989 ; taylor et al .",
    "1992 ) . here",
    "we report on an additional general relativistic phenomenon , the gravitomagnetic spin ",
    "orbital coupling known as geodetic precession .",
    "this precession provides a unique opportunity to study the pulsar beam along the latitude direction , orthogonal to the usual longitude dimension revealed by pulsars spinning across our line of sight .",
    "geodetic precession and resulting pulseshape changes in psr b1913 + 16 were predicted shortly after the pulsar s discovery in 1974 ( damour & ruffini 1974 ; barker & oconnell 1975a , b ; esposito & harrison 1975 ) . the expected signature of this phenomenon would be a change in the longitude separation of the two main pulse components , which are thought to be emitted from opposite sides of a hollow cone , as the line of sight slowly precesses across the cone .",
    "the first observational searches for evidence of geodetic precession were reported by weisberg , romani , & taylor ( 1989 ) and weisberg & taylor ( 1992 ) .",
    "the expected component separation variation was _ not _ observed , although a secular change in the relative _ intensity _ of the two main components was detected .",
    "these observations were interpreted by the authors as resulting from our line of sight fortuitously precessing across the _ middle _ ( to explain the constancy of component separation ) of a patchy ( to justify the relative intensity variation ) emission beam . @xcite then predicted on the basis of these observations that the beam will precess out of our line of sight in the year @xmath0 .",
    "the expected component separation change was finally detected by @xcite , using data from the effelsberg 100m dish combined with our earlier results .",
    "kramer used data on the separation between the two profile peaks as a function of time to fit a model for the geometry of the precession and of the beam . here",
    "we augment our earlier measurements with new arecibo post  upgrading observations over the last few years .",
    "we measure the beamwidth as a function of time at fourteen different intensity levels , and we fit these data to a model of the beam geometry to arrive at a picture of the two  dimensional structure of the emission region .",
    "all data were gathered at arecibo observatory at frequencies near 1400 mhz with one of a series of dedicated pulsar backends , called the mark i , ii , and iii systems [ see @xcite for details ] . in all cases , two orthogonal circularly polarized signals were sampled , detected , dedispersed , folded at the apparent pulsar period , and integrated on ",
    "line for five minutes .",
    "the resulting total power pulse profile was stored to tape as the basic processing unit , a `` scan . ''",
    "the scans from a given observing session , typically consisting of fourteen 23 h daily blocks of data acquisition , were then summed to create a `` session  average '' profile .",
    "all subsequent analyses used these twenty  two session average profiles , acquired between 1981 and 2001 .    in order to make the mark i , ii , and iii data as closely intercomparable as possible , we simulated in software some of the on - line hardware .",
    "we chose to smooth the mark i and ii data to match the coarser resolution of the mark iii system , with its @xmath1 exponential time constant , 1.25 mhz individual frequency channels , and 512 phase bins .",
    "( the mark i and mark ii data had already been made effectively equivalent by convolving the mark ii data with a @xmath2 time constant@xcite .",
    "the mark i and equivalent mark ii data were convolved with a decaying exponential function of @xmath3 time constant to match the mark iii hardware exponential time constant , and with an 11-bin ( @xmath4 ) boxcar function to simulate the dispersion smearing across the individual mark iii filter channels .",
    "adjacent pairs of the resulting 1024bin waveform were combined to create final 512bin mark i and mark ii profiles equivalent to the mark iii profiles .",
    "[ fig : rawprof ] shows the resulting profiles as a function of time , displayed as a contour plot with the right peak arbitrarily normalized to constant longitude and intensity .",
    "there are several notable items revealed in the fig .",
    "[ fig : rawprof ] contour plot .",
    "first , the leading to trailing  component peak intensity ratio @xmath5 continued its secular decline of @xmath6 yr , which @xcite attributed to our line of sight slowly precessing across a patchy beam .",
    "in addition , the peaks have clearly been moving together with time in the last decade , as first announced by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is evident that the saddle is filling in with time .",
    "surprisingly , however , the separation and shape of much of the profile outside the peaks remain virtually unchanged over the twenty - year timespan of data . while precession across a circular , hollow ",
    "cone beam would naturally be expected to result in more pronounced changes on its inner portions where the radius of curvature is small than on its outer segments , we will show below that our data can not be explained in this fashion alone .",
    "instead we will find from model fits that the beam must be elongated in the meridional ( i.e. , north  south ) direction , and hourglass  shaped .",
    "following up on our finding that our line of sight is slowly precessing across a patchy beam , we decomposed each epoch s profile into an odd and an even part , associating the former with the beam patchiness and the latter with the overall hollow  cone beam structure .",
    "[ fig : oddprof ] and [ fig : evenprof ] display the odd and even components , respectively .",
    "all subsequent global beam analysis was performed on the even parts alone .",
    "the pulsar beamwidth @xmath7 at various intensity levels was determined from these even profiles , providing the raw data for the analysis ( see below ) .      in our model , the beam half ",
    "width @xmath8 for a given @xmath9 constant intensity level is a function of scale factor @xmath10 ( of order unity ) ; fiducial half  width @xmath11 ; elongation parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; and north  south ( i.e. , meridional ) offset from beam axis @xmath14 ; as follows :    @xmath15    of the two elongation parameters , @xmath12 is essentially the axial ratio of the elongated beam , i.e. , approximately the ratio of its north  south to east  west extent ; while @xmath13 gives a @xmath14dependent adjustment on the shape",
    ".      eq .",
    "1 alone is not sufficient to relate our measured @xmath7 s in longitude units to our beam model , because we do not know the full observing geometry _ a priori_. for example ,",
    "the angle of the beam axis with respect to the observer , to the spin axis , and to the orbital axis are unknown .",
    "[ note that the _ sine _ of the orbital inclination , @xmath16 , is already known from pulse timing measurements @xcite , as discussed below . ]",
    "consequently we have to fit simultaneously for several additional geometrical quantities in addition to the elongated beam quantities delineated in eq .",
    "1 . in what follows we will use the work of @xcite as a general guide , but we will adhere to a right  handed coordinate system notation as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] . )",
    "the inclination @xmath17 is the angle between the orbital angular momentum vector @xmath18 ; and the line of sight vector from the observer to the pulsar , @xmath19 .",
    "the spin  orbit misalignment angle @xmath20 is measured between @xmath18 and the pulsar spin angular momentum vector @xmath21 , also called the north spin pole . and @xmath20 are operationally the same as kramer s ,",
    "although he actually defines each as the angle between two vectors , each of which points exactly oppositely to the two that we use .",
    "the @xmath20 of @xcite represents a different angle . ]",
    "geodetic precession of @xmath21 about @xmath18 occurs in the @xmath22 direction at a rate of @xmath23 yr [ see @xcite ; @xcite for the formula ] .",
    "the emission beam colatitude @xmath24 is the angle between @xmath21 and the visible magnetic axis @xmath25 , is the supplement of ours since he measures it with respect to his @xmath26 , which points oppositely to our pulsar spin angular momentum vector @xmath21 ] while line  of  sight colatitude @xmath28 is the angle between @xmath21 and the line of sight from the pulsar to observer @xmath29 , where @xmath30 . , which he calls @xmath31 .",
    "his @xmath31 , which is measured from the _ negative _ pulsar spin angular momentum axis , is the supplement of our @xmath28 .",
    "note that our angle @xmath32 defined below is a different angle from kramer s @xmath32 . ]",
    "now set up a right  handed coordinate system @xmath33 where @xmath34 points along the orbital angular momentum @xmath18 ; and the @xmath35vector points such that the plane defined by the @xmath35 and @xmath34 vectors contains the observer  pulsar line  of  sight vector @xmath19 ( with @xmath35 pointing more toward @xmath19 than toward its opposite , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the reference time @xmath36 is defined as the time when the ( precessing ) spin angular momentum vector @xmath21 lies in this same plane containing @xmath35 and @xmath34 ( and @xmath19 ) and points most directly toward @xmath35 and away from the observer .",
    "is the same as ours .",
    "it is defined to be the time when his pulsar spin axis , @xmath26 ( which points _ oppositely _ to our pulsar spin angular momentum vector @xmath21 ) , points most directly _ toward _ the observer .",
    "] we can then define a precessional phase @xmath37 . pointing _",
    "oppositely _ to our pulsar spin angular momentum vector @xmath21 , in a coordinate system whose @xmath38 and @xmath34 axes are inverted with respect to ours .",
    "] the position of the precessing spin axis , @xmath21 , can be resolved onto the cartesian coordinate system as follows :    @xmath39    while @xmath19 is resolved onto the same system as    @xmath40    the observer s line of sight colatitude @xmath28 can then be found at any epoch because the definition of the dot product requires that    @xmath41    so that we have    @xmath42    finally , @xmath31 , the impact parameter of the pulsar  observer line of sight @xmath29 with respect to the visible magnetic axis @xmath25 , is given by in the context of emission beam models .",
    "kramer s impact parameter @xmath43 differs from our angle @xmath31 by a sign since the two angles in the equation are the supplements of kramer s . ]",
    "@xmath44      for our quantitative beam modelling , we first determined the pulse width @xmath7 at fourteen intensity levels @xmath45 for each of twenty - two epochs in the even profiles , and we then fitted to these data the elongated , north  south symmetric beam model of eq . 1 plus the geometrical model delineated in the last section .",
    "the fourteen @xmath11 were fixed at values determined iteratively to optimize the fits described below .",
    "are an arbitrary set that is associated with the @xmath46 ( arbitrarily ) selected intensity levels . ]",
    "the orbital inclination @xmath17 was fixed at a value of @xmath47 or its supplement , as determined from pulse timing measurements of @xmath16 .",
    "the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 were then determined from a weighted least  squares fitting procedure .",
    "@xcite also fitted for quantities similar to the first three and four of these parameters with his azimuthally symmetric beam model and data on the separation between the profile _ peaks _ only .",
    "we are able to fit for two additional parameters quantifying the shape of the beam because of our measurements of beamwidth at many different intensity levels , rather than only at the profile peaks .    as also found by @xcite , there are four equivalent beam solutions : two of them result from the ambiguity in @xmath17 discussed above , based on the fact that pulse timing yields @xmath16",
    "then each of these two solutions is also degenerate in that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are indistinguishable .",
    "[ fig : data&fit ] displays the measured pulse widths , and the contours of constant intensity resulting from our final best fits to these data .",
    "( all four of the degenerate fits yield the same results on this figure , which is why they are degenerate . )",
    "fortunately we can rule out the two high@xmath20 solutions because of evolutionary considerations : the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors were almost certainly aligned due to mass exchange before the last supernova occurred , and asymmetries in that explosion that would misalign the two vectors are constrained by the observed pulsar velocity distribution ( bailes 1988 ; kramer 1998 ; wex et al 2000 ) .",
    "table 1 records quantitatively the two surviving low@xmath20 fits .",
    "because some of the fitted parameters are highly covariant , the formal errors must be read with caution . in order to further examine the uncertainties in fitted quantities",
    ", we explored @xmath52space two parameters at a time in the following fashion .",
    "we stepped the two chosen parameters through a grid of values in the vicinity of the @xmath52minimum , holding them fixed at each grid point while allowing all other parameters to be fitted .",
    "the resulting @xmath52 at each such grid point was then calculated and a contour map of @xmath52 as a function of the two parameters was generated .",
    "we display the two maps showing the most serious covariance in fig .",
    "[ fig : chisq ] .",
    "note especially that @xmath52 contours associated with @xmath24 and @xmath20 indicate that the possible range of their errors is much larger than indicated in our formal uncertainties .      in an effort to provide additional information on the emission beam geometry ,",
    "we have also measured the polarization properties of the pulse profile starting with our 1998 observing session , using the princeton mark iv backend @xcite .",
    "early pulsar observations revealed a characteristic @xmath53shaped sweep of polarization position angle across many pulse profiles . according to the rotating vector model ( rvm ) of @xcite , this signature",
    "can be understood as the projection of the rotating neutron star s magnetic field lines onto the observer s line of sight , because the emission is locally polarized in ( or perpendicular to ) the plane of the field lines . in theory , it is possible to fit linear polarization position angle data to the rvm in order to derive the emission beam geometry . in practice , however , it has been shown that unambiguous geometrical solutions from rvm fits to linear polarization data are rare , for two principal reasons @xcite : first , the observable emission from most pulsars occupies such a narrow longitude range that rvm fit parameters are highly covariant ; and second , many pulsars emission does not conform simply to the rvm itself .",
    "our polarized profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stokes ] ) , indeed exhibit a complicated form .",
    "@xcite also measured and remarked on the complicated nature of the position angle curve .",
    "they noted that its overall sweep of @xmath54 is not allowed in the rotating vector model , and that the rapid swings indicate switching between orthogonal emission modes .",
    "these features have prevented us from being able to perform rvm fits to the position angle data that yield unique values for geometric parameters .    despite these complications ,",
    "the position angle data do provide critical information that enables us to select one and reject one of our two remaining beam model solutions .",
    "to do so , we calculated position angle curves for the best ",
    "fitting parameter values of both solutions listed in table 1 .",
    "for each solution , we first calculated the observers line of sight colatitude for the observing epoch @xmath28 , from eq .",
    "we then determined the expected rvm linearly polarized position angle follows the observers convention , increasing counterclockwise on the sky . ]",
    "@xmath55 with longitude @xmath56 curve from the classic rvm equation [ corrected for signs ; see @xcite ] :    @xmath57    note that @xmath24 and @xmath28 go to their supplements in the alternate solutions , which also causes the impact parameter @xmath31 to flip sign ( see eq . 6 ) .",
    "this has crucial implications for the rvm and the polarized profile , since the slope of the polarized linear position angle curve , @xmath58 at the center of the pulse , also changes sign because our line of sight moves from one side of the magnetic axis to the other [ see @xcite for details ] .    the results for both solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stokes ] atop the data .",
    "as expected , one model ( solution 2 , with @xmath59 ) clearly gives a grossly wrong position angle sweep with the wrong sign .",
    "the complementary model , ( solution 1 , @xmath60 ) sweeps in position angle in the same sense as the data .",
    "it appears especially heartening that solution 1 matches the observed position angles in the central regions of the pulse , not just in the sign of the slope but also in a more detailed fashion . as a result , we closely studied the position angle measurements in our data as well as the earlier polarimetry of cordes et al ( 1990 ) .",
    "the precession should cause the position angle curve to vary with time as @xmath61 changes .",
    "the predicted changes are rather small over the timespan of our mark iv data .",
    "however , we were disappointed to note that the cordes et al .",
    "data from epoch 1988.5 , which should show a position angle curve measurably different from current data , do _",
    "not_. rather , the much earlier cordes et al .",
    "position angle curve is essentially indistinguishable from our mark iv curves to within the noise .",
    "we conclude that the pulsar s emission is not following the rvm in detail .",
    "nevertheless , it seems likely that the slope of the position angle curve near the symmetry axis of the pulse should still be related to the apparent rotation of the magnetic field lines emanating from the magnetic pole as they sweep across our line of sight , and hence successfully chooses the sign of @xmath32 and thus solution 1 .",
    "the fitted equal  intensity contours alone , without the data , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamlong ] , over a much larger north  south range than we have directly observed .",
    "we delineate the portion of the beam that we have directly sampled over the past twenty years with two horizontal lines .",
    "note that we have observed only a small part of the beam in the vertical direction .",
    "consequently our model is by no means unique , and it is probably incorrect in its details .",
    "most notably , our assumption of north  south beam symmetry is currently untestable since all observations probe only the northern side of the beam .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that _ any _ successful beam model must be able to match the striking features shown in the data and in our model : a shrinkage with time of the inner and peak equal  intensity contours , combined with uniform or even slightly growing outer contour widths .    the apparent north - south asymmetry in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamlong ] is an artefact of displaying the horizontal axis in directly measurable longitude units ( where @xmath62 pulsar rotation ) , which are portions of small circles whose arc length varies as one approaches a pole .",
    "[ fig : beamarc ] displays the best fitting beam model in true great  circle arc units on both axes , and the expected north  south ( and east  west ) symmetries are evident in this display .",
    "it is surprising that the beam takes on an `` hourglass '' shape in order to match our observations of pulsewidth that varies strongly at small radii and remains virtually unchanged or even growing slightly at larger radii .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite have also derived an hourglass  shaped beam for psr b1828 - 11 , an isolated pulsar that is also undergoing spin axis precession .",
    "thus the only two pulsars whose beams have been mapped in the meridional direction show qualitatively similar beamshapes .",
    "others have investigated pulsar beamshapes .",
    "most studies are based on rather indirect observational arguments , usually involving analyses of position angle and pulsewidth data in the pulsar population . @xcite and @xcite found significant north  south beam elongation .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite indicated that the emission is consistent with a circular cone .",
    "@xcite also supported circular cones although finding marginal evidence for meridional _ compression_. @xcite and @xcite also point out that the beam will be meridionally compressed if its boundary is defined by the last closed field lines in a spinning neutron star with a tilted magnetic axis .",
    "there is clearly no consensus on the overall beam elongation .",
    "in addition , we are not aware of any observational or theoretical studies indicating the hourglass shape , other than ours and @xcite .",
    "we have used twenty years of pulse profile measurements on psr b1913 + 16 to detect geodetic precession of the spin axis and to model the emission beam geometry .",
    "evolutionary considerations and polarization measurements enable us to choose a single preferred model from four equivalent solutions .",
    "while we have only sampled a limited portion of the beam to date , our model indicates that the beam is elongated and hourglass  shaped in the latitude direction .",
    "future observations will enable us to study the two dimensional beam structure at larger impact parameters , further constraining the details of the beamshape .",
