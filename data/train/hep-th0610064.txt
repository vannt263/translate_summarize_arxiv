    "the function @xmath113 is not invertible in general and different @xmath1 s can lead to the same com(@xmath1 ) .",
    "let us look at the type iiia trajectory in fig .  1 as an example .",
    "first we concentrate on its part close to the turning point , staying away from the spiraling regime in the uv , and the ir region where the einstein - hilbert truncation breaks down .",
    "we observe then that for every scale @xmath114 below the turning point there exists a corresponding scale @xmath115 which has the same @xmath116- and therefore @xmath101-value . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding cutoff modes are equal at the two scales : com(@xmath1)=com(@xmath117 ) .",
    "if the turning point is sufficiently close to the gaussian fixed point , and @xmath1 is not too far from @xmath118 , we may use the linearization ( [ run ] ) for an approximate determination of @xmath117 . because of the  duality symmetry \" ( [ du ] ) it is given by @xmath119 . in the `` spiraling '' regime many different @xmath1-values have the same @xmath38 and com(@xmath1 ) .",

    "thanks to the symmetry of the sphere it is neither position nor direction dependent .    taking the result @xmath128 , it seems as if nothing remarkable had happened .",

    "however , in region ii ) , the sphere starts to _ shrink _ , due to a growing cosmological constant @xmath18 . at the turning point scale @xmath118 at which @xmath135 assumes its minimum @xmath30 ,",
    "the shrinking becomes faster than the improvement of the resolution ( @xmath136 in region iii ) ) .",
    "although we can resolve smaller and smaller proper distances , this is of no use , since the sphere is shrinking so fast that a _ smaller _ proper length corresponds to a _ larger _ angular distance .",
    "finally , in the fixed point regime ( at large angles although this is an ultraviolet fixed point ! ) , the shrinking slows down to a rate that cancels exactly the improved resolution of the microscope ( @xmath137 ) so that the angular resolution approaches a constant value @xmath138 after the oscillations have been damped away .",
    "the minimum of @xmath107 at the turning point is equivalent to a maximum of the @xmath101 quantum number the coms can have : @xmath139 .",
    "this result does _ not _ mean that in the fundamental path integral underlying the flow equation not all quantum fluctuations are integrated out when @xmath1 is lowered from infinity to @xmath6 .",

    "in fact , the argument leading to the finite resolution @xmath132 is fairly independent of the high energy behavior of the theory .",
    "the crucial ingredient in the above reasoning was the occurrence of a minimum value for @xmath38 .",
    "this minimum occurs as a direct consequence of the @xmath33-running of @xmath18 given in eq .",
    "( [ run ] ) .",
    "however , this @xmath33-running occurs already in standard perturbation theory , simply reflecting the quartic divergences of all vacuum diagrams . from this point of view",
    "our argument is rather robust .",
    "the upper bound on the angular momentum like quantum number @xmath101 is reminiscent of the  fuzzy sphere \" constructed in ref .",
    "while in the case of the fuzzy sphere the finite angular resolution is put in  by hand \" , in the present case it emerges as a consequence of the quantum gravitational dynamics .",
