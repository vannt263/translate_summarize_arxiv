    "in 2013 the besiii and belle collaborations reported the observation of a charged state in the charmonium sector called @xmath0 @xcite ( this state was also seen at cleo @xcite ) .",
    "the measured mass and width are @xmath2 soon after its discovery it was proposed that these states are @xmath1-wave hadronic molecules @xcite . later a further analysis in this",
    "framework and different approaches for the substructure like tetraquarks were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    ", we will assume that the @xmath3 is indeed a hadronic molecule .",
    "a comparison with combinations of charm mesons shows that this states lies close to a specific threshold and thus favors this interpretation .",
    "denoting the wave function with the respective particle name , one can identify their main component to be @xcite @xmath4 first , the constituents are charm mesons whose masses are far above @xmath5 and second , their binding energy is rather small , i.e. below the pion mass @xmath6 or at least of that order .",
    "hence , for the description of these states one can use in a first approximation a pionless effective field theory where the constituents are treated as non - relativistic , point - like particles which only interact via contact interactions . such an short - range effective theory is called eft(@xmath7 ) and is a commonly used tool in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "its expansion parameter is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scale of the modulus @xmath10 of the internal momenta @xmath11 of the involved particles which are - according to the small binding energy of the molecule , @xmath12 - below the pion mass @xmath6 .",
    "we already remark here that the characteristics of the @xmath3 are such that eft(@xmath7 ) is barely applicable , but it still allows for some first insights into the electromagnetic structure of this exotic particle .    in particular , using the charm meson masses from ref .",
    "@xcite the ( averaged ) binding energy @xmath13 can be obtained as @xmath14 \\nonumber\\\\     & = & ( -23.13 \\ : \\pm \\ : 6.01 ) \\ : \\rm{mev } \\label{binding_energy_z_c } \\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the negative value implies a resonance instead of a charm meson bound state solution . neglecting the imaginary part of the binding momentum @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "[ sec : forma ] ) , we treat the @xmath0 as a virtual state with negative scattering length . the binding momentum obtained from the extracted binding energy , eq .",
    "( [ binding_energy_z_c ] ) , is @xmath16 where the uncertainty is entirely from the one in the binding energy . in leading order ,",
    "the electromagnetic properties are independent of the sign of @xmath15 .",
    "our eft expansion parameter is @xmath17 and since the binding momentum @xmath15 should be a low - energy scale proportional to @xmath9 to provide a proper counting scheme , one concludes that @xmath18 must be smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "this is not the case for our estimate of @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ binding_momentum ] ) .",
    "however , one can use the predictions for the @xmath3 as first , _ rough _ model estimations and we will do so in the following .",
    "our predictions can be made more quantitative by explicitly including pions in the theory .",
    "for the charm molecule @xmath3 the analysis of its decay channel shows that the quantum numbers @xmath20 are favored @xcite , which agrees with the @xmath1-wave hypothesis .",
    "thus the @xmath3 can be described by an effective field theory with @xmath1-wave contact interactions similar to the loosely - bound charm molecule @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the structure of the @xmath3 state can then be calculated analog to the deuteron treated in eft(@xmath7 ) as a baryonic molecule of nucleons in a relative @xmath1-wave with total spin @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "besides this analogy , there is also a conceptual connection to the so - called halo eft developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and in particular to its application in ref .  @xcite .",

    "mesons simply reproduce the free schrdinger equation which is linear in the time derivative .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 is an auxiliary field describing the molecular state @xmath0 , @xmath27 is the coupling constant for @xmath28 interactions , @xmath29 is a constant and @xmath30 is a phase whose sign depends on the effective range .",
    "we stress that the @xmath3 is not treated as a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "we use the `` dimeron '' formalism of kaplan @xcite which is convenient to treat non - perturbative contact interactions .",
    "if the auxilliary field is integrated out , the langrangian ( [ z_lagrangian ] ) reduces to one with contact interactions between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 mesons .",
    "if the phase @xmath31 is negative , the @xmath26 field is a ghost but the scattering amplitude for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 mesons is unitary and sensible .",
    "this method is well established in effective field theory treatments of resonant interactions in nuclear and particle physics @xcite .",
    "note also that the spin structure of the @xmath25 and @xmath3 is hidden in eq .",
    "( [ z_lagrangian ] ) since the interactions are spin - independent .",
    "since there are only @xmath1-wave interactions , the spin state of the @xmath3 is always equal to the spin state of the constituent @xmath25 and remains unchanged in the @xmath28 interaction vertex .    minimal substitution with electric charge @xmath32 induces an @xmath33 interaction with the constituents and the molecule itself , leading to the feynman diagrams which contribute to the charge form factor .",
    "the magnetic form factor instead comes from the terms in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ z_lagrangian ] ) , where @xmath34 is the magnetic field and @xmath35 is the spin-1 generalization of the pauli vector for spin-1/2 particles , with @xmath36 being the generators of the rotation group .",
    "those terms are proportional to the magnetic moment @xmath37 of the respective charged particle and describe purely magnetic interactions of the spatial part of the vector potential @xmath38 with both the charged @xmath24 mesons and @xmath3 .",
    "other contributions to the lagrangian , for instance those relevant for the quadrupole form factor or effects due to the anomalous magnetic moment of neutral @xmath24 mesons , are at least one order higher and thus not shown .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath3 binding energy scale of order 20 mev is small compared to the @xmath24-@xmath25 mass splitting of about 140 mev .",
    "our lagrangian is only valid in a small energy region close to the @xmath3 mass and thus heavy quark symmetry is not relevant .",
