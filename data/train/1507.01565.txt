    "interestingly , the conjecture is remarkably close to being true in these counterexamples , with the maximum points occurring in almost but not quite the same location .",
    "we can not explain this unexpected closeness .",
    "a fascinating open problem is to bound the difference in location of the maximum points of two semilinear poisson equations in terms of the difference between their nonlinearity functions and geometric information on the shape of the domain .",
    "also , note that for both the half - disk and right isosceles triangle , our results show that the maximum point of the torsion function lies to the left of the maximum for the ground state ( when oriented as in ) , which perhaps hints at a general principle for a class of convex domains .",
