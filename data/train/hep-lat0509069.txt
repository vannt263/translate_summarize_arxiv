    "a change of variables of the non - abelian gauge potential in yang ",
    "mills theory was proposed by cho @xcite and faddeev and niemi @xcite .",
    "the cho - faddeev - niemi ( cfn ) decomposition or change of variables introduces a color vector field @xmath17 enabling us to extract explicitly the magnetic monopole as a topological degree of freedom from the gauge potential without introducing the fundamental scalar field in yang  mills theory .",
    "the cfn decomposition has been formulated and extensively studied on the continuum spacetime . for non - perturbative studies , however , it is desirable to put the cfn decomposition on a lattice",
    ". this will enable us to perform powerful numerical simulations to obtain fully non - perturbative results .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to propose a lattice formulation of the cfn decomposition and to perform the numerical simulations on the lattice , paying special attention to the magnetic monopole .",
    "the magnetic monopole is the indispensable ingredients for the dual superconductivity scenario @xcite for quark confinement .",
    "the idea of abelian projection due to t hooft @xcite is that the partial gauge fixing can extract the physical degrees of freedom relevant in the long - distance of qcd .",
    "it has been shown that a magnetic monopole appears as a defect ( singularity ) of the partial gauge fixing at degenerate points of the operator to be diagonalized through the abelian projection .",
    "the most efficient partial gauge fixing from this viewpoint is known to be the maximally abelian gauge ( mag ) @xcite , although we can consider other abelian gauges @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations @xcite have confirmed that only this gauge leads to the abelian dominance predicted by @xcite and the magnetic monopole dominance @xcite for the string tension .",
    "this is also the case of chiral symmetry breaking .    in defining the monopole on the lattice ,",
    "the degrand - toussaint ( dt ) method @xcite has been extensively used so far .",
    "however , it is not clear that the dt monopole agrees with the qcd monopole a la t hooft , in the sense that i ) dt method defines a monopole by counting the number of dirac strings coming out from an elementary cube without examining the singularities of the gauge fixing condition @xcite , and that ii ) there is no correlation between the existence point of the dt monopole and the degenerate point of the eigenvalues of the diagonalized operator in the abelian projection .",
    "furthermore , iii ) the monopole dominance can not be seen in abelian gauges other than mag , but the mag breaks explicitly the color symmetry ( global gauge invariance ) .",
    "this disadvantage of the mag yields the dubious reputation that the qcd magnetic monopole might be a gauge artifact .",
    "recently , some ideas of defining gauge invariant monopole on a lattice were submitted , e.g. , @xcite . these approaches",
    "could be compared with confinement on a lattice based on other definitions @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a method of implementing the cfn decomposition on a lattice .",
    "our lattice formulation reflects a new viewpoint proposed by three of the authors in a previous paper @xcite , which enables us to retain the local and global gauge invariance even after the new type of mag .",
    "then , within this framework of the cfn decomposition , we give a definition of the gauge invariant monopole on a lattice .",
    "the comparison of our construction with the dt one in the conventional mag reveal that two methods give nearly the same result for the monopole density .",
    "moreover , if the lattice version of the gauge - invariant field strength @xmath18 defined in @xcite is separated into the electric and magnetic parts , the magnetic part gives the dominant contribution to the cfn monopole and the cfn monopole is determined by the hedgehog - like configuration of the color vector field @xmath19 in the cfn decomposition , confirming the expectation in the previous work @xcite .",
    "we adopt the cho - faddeev - niemi ( cfn ) decomposition for the non - abelian gauge field @xcite : by introducing a unit vector field @xmath17 with three components , i.e. , @xmath20 @xmath21 , the non - abelian gauge field @xmath22 in the su(2 ) yang - mills theory is decomposed as @xmath23 in what follows , we use the notation : @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . by definition , @xmath27 is parallel to @xmath17 , while @xmath28 is orthogonal to @xmath17 .",
    "we require @xmath29 to be orthogonal to @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "we call @xmath27 the restricted potential , while @xmath29 is called the gauge - covariant potential and @xmath28 is called the non - abelian magnetic potential . in the naive abelian projection , @xmath27 corresponds to the diagonal component , while @xmath29 corresponds to the off - diagonal component , apart from the vanishing magnetic part @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , the non - abelian field strength @xmath31 is decomposed as @xmath32 where we have introduced the covariant derivative in the background field @xmath33 by @xmath34   \\equiv \\hat{d}_\\mu   : = \\partial_\\mu    + g \\mathbb{v}_\\mu \\times   , $ ] and defined the two kinds of field strength : @xmath35 due to the special definition of @xmath36 , the magnetic field strength @xmath37 is rewritten as @xmath38 where we have used a fact that @xmath37 is parallel to @xmath19 .",
    "we define the cfn - yang ",
    "mills theory as the yang - mills theory written in terms of the cfn variables @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the su(2 ) cfn - yang - mills theory has the enlarged local gauge symmetry @xmath39_{local}^{\\theta}$ ] larger than the local gauge symmetry @xmath40 in the original yang  mills theory .",
    "this is because we can rotate the cfn variable @xmath17 by angle @xmath41 independently of the gauge transformation of @xmath22 by the parameter @xmath42 . in order to fix the whole enlarged local gauge symmetry @xmath43",
    ", we must impose sufficient number of gauge fixing conditions .",
    "recently , it has been clarified @xcite how the cfn - yang ",
    "mills theory can be equivalent to the original yang - mills theory by imposing a type of gauge fixing called the new maximal abelian gauge ( nmag ) for fixing the extra local gauge invariance in the continuum formulation .",
    "now we discuss how the cfn decomposition is implemented on a lattice by defining the unit color vector field @xmath44 to generate the ensemble of @xmath19-fields . in the whole of this paper",
    ", we restrict the gauge group to su(2 ) .",
    "first of all , we generate the configurations of su(2 ) link variables @xmath45 , @xmath46 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the standard wilson action based on the heat bath method @xcite where @xmath47 is the lattice spacing and @xmath48 is the coupling constant .",
    "we use the continuum notation for the lie - algebra valued field variables , e.g. , @xmath22 , even on a lattice .",
    "next , we define the new maximal abelian gauge ( nmag ) on a lattice . by introducing a vector field @xmath49 of a unit length with three components , we consider a functional @xmath50 $ ] written in terms of the gauge ( link ) variable @xmath51 and the color ( site ) variable @xmath44 defined by @xmath52    : = \\sum_{x,\\mu }   { \\rm tr}({\\bf 1}-{}^{\\theta}\\bm{n}_{x } { } ^{\\omega}u_{x,\\mu } { } ^{\\theta}\\bm{n}_{x+\\mu } { } ^{\\omega}u_{x,\\mu}^\\dagger ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced the enlarged gauge transformation : @xmath53 for the link variable @xmath51 and @xmath54 for an initial site variable @xmath55 where gauge group elements @xmath56 and @xmath57 are independent su(2 ) matrices on a site @xmath58 .",
    "the former corresponds to the @xmath59 gauge transformation @xmath60 of the original potential : @xmath61\\omega^\\dagger(x ) = \\mathscr{a}_\\mu(x)+d_\\mu[\\mathscr{a}]\\bm{\\omega}(x ) + o(\\bm{\\omega}^2)$ ] for the @xmath62 , while the infinitesimal form of the latter reads @xmath63 for the adjoint @xmath64^{\\theta}$ ] rotation @xmath65 .    after imposing the nmag",
    ", the theory still has the local gauge symmetry @xmath66 , since the diagonal gauge transformation @xmath67 does not change the vaue of the functional @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 configuration can not be determined at this stage . in order to completely fix the gauge and to determine @xmath49",
    ", we need to impose another gauge fixing condition for fixing @xmath68 . in this paper",
    "we choose the conventional lorentz - landau gauge or lattice landau gauge ( llg ) for this purpose .",
    "the llg can be imposed by minimizing the function @xmath69 $ ] : @xmath70 = \\sum_{x,\\mu } { \\rm tr}({\\bf 1}-{}^{\\omega}u_{x,\\mu } )     \\rightarrow 1/4 \\int d^4x \\   [ ( \\mathscr{a}_\\mu)^{\\omega}(x)]^2      \\quad ( \\epsilon \\rightarrow 0 ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with respect to the gauge transformation @xmath56 for the given link configurations @xmath45 , @xmath71     \\rightarrow     \\min_{\\omega } \\int d^4x \\   [ ( \\mathscr{a}_\\mu)^{\\omega}(x)]^2   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] see fig .",
    "[ fig : gf - orbit ] . in the continuum formulation , this is equivalent to imposing the gauge fixing condition @xmath72 .",
    "the llg fixes the local gauge symmetry @xmath73 , while the llg leaves the global symmetry su(2)@xmath74 intact .        once the link variable is identified with the cfn version : @xmath75\\ }   ,    \\label{lcfn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to show that the functional @xmath50 $ ] reduces in the naive continuum limit @xmath76 to the functional of the nmag in the continuum formulation given in @xcite : @xmath77    \\rightarrow \\min_{\\omega , \\theta } \\int d^4x \\   [ ( \\mathbb{x}_\\mu)^{\\omega , \\theta}(x)]^2   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we define the _ lattice nmag _ by minimizing the functional @xmath50 $ ] with respect to the enlarged gauge transformation @xmath78 and @xmath79 . we call ( [ lcfn ] ) the _ lattice cfn",
    "decomposition_.    then a remaining issue to be clarified is how to construct the ensemble of the color @xmath19-fields used in defining @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 . in what follows ,",
    "we show that the desired color vector field @xmath44 is constructed from the interpolating gauge transformation matrix @xmath57 by choosing the initial value @xmath80 and @xmath81/2    \\quad   ( a=1,2,3).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a basic observation is that the functional @xmath50 $ ] has another equivalent form @xmath82=f_{nmag}[u , { \\bm n } ; \\omega , \\theta]$ ] : @xmath83     : = \\sum_{x,\\mu }   { \\rm tr}({\\bf 1}-\\sigma_3 \\ { } ^{g}{}u_{x,\\mu } \\",

    "the minimization of @xmath82 $ ] with respect to the gauge transformation @xmath85 leads to the same form as the conventional mag in the naive continuum limit : @xmath86       \\rightarrow     \\min_{\\alpha } \\int d^4x \\   [ ( a^a_\\mu)^{\\alpha}(x)]^2   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the cartan decomposition for @xmath22 has been used under the identification : @xmath87 \\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are respectively called diagonal and off - diagonal gauge fields with su(2 ) generators @xmath90 .",
    "this procedure determines the configurations @xmath91 achieving the minimum of @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : gf - orbit ] .    on a gauge orbit ,",
    "two representatives on the two gauge - fixing hypersurfaces ( mag and llg ) are connected by the gauge transformation @xmath92 .",
    "thus we can determine a set of interpolating gauge - rotation matrices @xmath93 to construct @xmath49 ensemble .",
    "in fact , the color vector @xmath44 constructed in this way represents a real - valued vector @xmath94 of unit length with three components , and transforms in the adjoint representation under the gauge transformation ii . by imposing simultaneously the nmag and the llg in this way",
    ", we can completely fix the local gauge invariance @xmath43 of the lattice cfn - yang  mills theory .",
    "it is remarkable that , even after the complete gauge fixing , the global gauge ( color ) symmetry @xmath95 is unbroken .",
    "our numerical simulations are performed as follows . in the continuum formulation ,",
    "the cfn variables were introduced as a change of variables in such a way that they do not break the global gauge symmetry @xmath96 or `` color symmetry '' , corresponding to the global gauge symmetry @xmath97 in the original yang - mills theory .",
    "hence the nmag can be imposed in terms of the cfn variables without breaking the color symmetry .",
    "this is a crucial difference between the nmag based on the cfn decomposition and the conventional mag based on the ordinary cartan decomposition which breaks the @xmath98 explicitly .",
    "therefore , we must perform the numerical simulations so as to preserve the color symmetry as much as possible .",
    "this is in fact possible as follows .",
    "remember that the nmag on a lattice is achieved by repeatedly performing the gauge transformations . in order to preserve the global su(2 ) symmetry ,",
    "we adopt a random gauge transformation only in the first sweep among the whole sweeps of gauge transformations in the standard iterative gauge fixing procedure for the llg .",
    "this procedure moves an ensemble of unit vectors @xmath44 to a random ensemble of @xmath44 which is far away from @xmath99 .",
    "then we search for the local minima around this configuration of @xmath44 by performing the successive gauge transformations .",
    "the first random gauge transformation as well as the subsequent gauge transformations are accumulated to obtain the gauge transformation matrix @xmath100 by which @xmath19 is constructed .    beginning with the mag and ending with the llg in this way , we can impose both nmag and llg simultaneously .",
    "our numerical simulations are performed on the lattice with the lattice size @xmath101 and @xmath102 by using the standard wilson action for the gauge coupling @xmath103 and periodic boundary conditions . staring with cold initial condition and thermalizing 30 * 100 ( resp .",

    "the two - point correlation functions @xmath110 ( no summation over @xmath111 ) exhibit almost the same behavior in all the directions ( @xmath112 ) , while @xmath109 ( @xmath113 ) vanish .",

    "according to our viewpoint @xcite , the @xmath44 field must respect the global @xmath117 symmetry .",
    "if this is not the case , the field @xmath44 can not be identified with the color vector field in the cfn decomposition of the original gauge potential from our viewpoint @xcite . this is a crucial point .",

    "although the similar technique of constructing the unit vector field @xmath118 from a @xmath116 matrix @xmath119 has already appeared , e.g. , in @xcite , there is a crucial conceptual difference between our approach and others .",
    "we can perform the global su(2 ) rotation at will , since it is not prohibited in our setting .",
    "however , the previous numerical simulations are performed only in a restricted setting where llg and mag are close to each other @xcite by imposing llg as a preconditioning , in the sense that the matrices @xmath100 connecting llg and mag are on average close to the unit ones .",

    "this implies that the color vector @xmath17 is not aligned in the same direction in the color space so that it fails to produce the non - zero magnetic current @xmath189 through @xmath159 .",
    "rather , the color vector @xmath17 represents the hedgehog like configuration to produce the whole magnetic current through @xmath160 .",
    "the configuration of @xmath19 obtained in our simulations does not lead to the singularities in the electric part @xmath159 and that the electric part @xmath159 does not contribute to the monopole current .",

    "in this paper , we have shown how to implement the cfn decomposition ( change of variables ) of su(2 ) yang  mills theory on a lattice , according to a new viewpoint proposed in @xcite .",
    "a remarkable point is that our approach can preserve both the local su(2 ) gauge symmetry and the color symmetry ( global su(2 ) symmetry ) even after imposing a new type of gauge fixing ( called the nmag ) which is regarded as a constraint to reproduce the original yang - mills theory .",
    "moreover , we have succeeded to perform the numerical simulations in such a way that the color symmetry is unbroken .",
    "we have given a new definition of the magnetic monopole - current called the cfn monopole current by using the cfn variables on a lattice just constructed .",
    "an advantage of our definition of magnetic monopole is that it is su(2 ) gauge invariant .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the cfn monopole gives nearly the same value as given by dt monopole , suggesting the equivalence of two definitions on a lattice .",
    "therefore , the cfn monopole is expected to be used , instead of dt monopole , to study the confinement phenomena of su(2 ) qcd and reproduce the monopole dominance in the string tension , the monopole action as a low - energy effective action of qcd , finite - temperature phase transition ( confinement - deconfinement transition ) .",
    "our construction of the magnetic current is more similar to the original abelian projection of t hooft rather than that of dt .",
    "however , the construction of the cfn monopole current given in this paper does not guarantee the integer - valued magnetic charge realized by dt monopole .",
    "the magnetic charge is indeed the real valued , in contrast with the conventional dt monopole .",
    "this disadvantage can be cured by converting it to the compact variable so as to guarantee the quantized magnetic charge from the beginning , as given in a subsequent paper",
    ". it will be interesting to examine the contribution of the cfn monopole to the wilson loop for confirming the monopole dominance in confinement .",
