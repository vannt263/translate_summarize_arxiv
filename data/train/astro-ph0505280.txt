    "accreting stellar - mass black holes appear in a number of respects to be scale models of the accreting supermassive black holes that power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "in particular , these sources , which have been dubbed microquasars @xcite , display power - law non - thermal spectra and jets that are not infrequently strongly relativistic ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of microquasars presumably indicates that the physics of accreting black holes is dominated by classical gravity and electromagnetism , which are entirely scale - free theories .",
    "whatever its theoretical significance , the scaling from quasars to microquasars implies that the evolution of a source in the milky way is similar to that of an agn but speeded up by a factor of order @xmath0 ( the ratio of the masses of the black holes ) .",
    "hence by studying a stellar - mass object over a human lifetime one can gain insights into the variability of agn over time - scales in excess of @xmath1 , and thus extrapolate from observed properties of agn to the long - term time - averaged properties of these objects .",
    "it is conventional to divide the most luminous agn into radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars @xcite . despite considerable effort over several decades",
    ", it remains unclear what determines the radio - loudness of a given quasar .",
    "only a small minority of quasars are radio - loud @xcite .",
    "it is widely suspected that large - scale radio emission of quasars is variable on time - scales of @xmath2 @xcite , and a possibility that has often been discussed is that many quasars that are now radio - quiet are at times radio - loud , while currently radio - loud quasars may often be radio - quiet .",
    "it is then natural to associate different modes of radio emission of microquasars with radio properties of agn @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use data on the x - ray and radio variability of microquasars to identify the stellar - mass analogues of radio - loud quasars , and demonstrate that the microquasars cygx-3 and grs1915 + 105 spend a few percent of their time in the radio - loud mode .",
    "by contrast cygx-1 shows no sign of entering the radio - loud regime .",
    "we present data that suggest that two distinct physical modes are at work in the radio emission of microquasars .",
    "one , which we call the ` coupled ' mode , causes the x - ray and radio fluxes to vary approximately together @xcite and never causes the system to become radio - loud .",
    "the other , which we call the ` flaring ' mode , dramatically boosts the radio luminosity of the source , making it radio - loud , by causing dramatic ejection events .",
    "these events have little impact on the x - ray luminosity ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "this paper is based on radio and x - ray monitoring data of the x - ray binaries grs1915 + 105 , cygx-3 , scox-1 and cygx-1 taken respectively from the archive of the us national radio astronomy observatory green bank interferometer ( gbi ) and the rossi x - ray timing explorer all - sky monitor ( asm ) . in particular , we consider daily - averaged 2 - 10 kev asm light - curves and daily - averaged 2.25 ghz gbi light - curves .",
    "the x - ray light - curves of the four sources refer to the period @xmath3 ( j.d.@xmath4 ) ; the periods covered by the radio light curves differ from source to source ( @xmath5 for grs1915 + 105 , @xmath6 for cygx-3 , @xmath7 for scox-1 , @xmath8 for cygx-1 ; j.d.@xmath4 ) .",
    "we estimated the power - spectra of the unequally spaced light curves by computing lomb s periodgrams @xcite , and subtracting statistical noise due to observational uncertainties .",
    "we adopt the usual normalization , so the power spectrum is in units of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the average luminosity .    the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ xrpsh ] shows for cygx-1 the power spectrum of emission in the radio ( filled points ) and x - ray ( open points ) bands .",
    "the power spectra have very similar normalizations and there is at most a suggestion that the radio points define a slightly flatter slope .",
    "thus the power spectrum of this source is the same in the radio and x - ray bands .",
    "the ( filled ) histogram of radio powers on the right indicates that cygx-1 is not highly variable .",
    "the corresponding distribution of x - ray luminosity ( empty histogram ) is somewhat wider than the radio distribution .",
    "the top panels in fig .",
    "[ xrpsh ] tell a very different story for grs1915 + 105 .",
    "the radio power spectrum still has a similar shape to the x - ray one , but its normalization is higher by a factor @xmath11 .",
    "the histogram of radio luminosities in the top right panel reveals a hump of low - luminosity events that is very similar to that seen in the histogram for cygx-1 , but in the case of grs1915 + 105 there is a long tail to high luminosity that is absent in the case of cygx-1 .",
    "it is this tail of high - luminosity radio flares that lifts the radio power spectrum clear of the x - ray power spectrum of the same object .    the second layer of panels in fig .",
    "[ xrpsh ] shows that cygx-3 has radio and x - ray statistics that mirror those of grs1915 + 105 rather than those of cygx-1 .",
    "the third layer of panels shows data for the neutron - star powered source scox-1 . as in the cases of grs1915 + 105 and cygx-3 ,",
    "the radio power spectrum lies well above the x - ray power spectrum , but the offset is now slightly smaller , though still larger than an order of magnitude .",
    "the cause of the offset is again a tail of events that have high radio luminosity .",
    "this tail is not as prominent as in the top two histograms .",
    "none of the x - ray histograms has a high - luminosity tail .",
    "the x - ray histograms of the three black - hole candidates are all slightly wider than the peaks in the corresponding radio histograms , and it is possible that the underlying x - ray distributions are themselves bimodal , especially in the case of cygx-3 and cygx-1 .",
    "this is consistent with the well known existence in these sources of two distinct x - ray states ( ` low / hard ' and ` high / soft ' ) .",
    "scox-1 , unlike the three black - hole candidates , has an x - ray histogram that is distinctly narrower than the peaked part of the radio histogram .",
    "the narrowness of the x - ray histogram for scox-1 may indicate that the fluctuating x - ray luminosity from the accretion flow and jet is superimposed on a steady contribution @xmath12 to the x - ray luminosity from the surface of the neutron star @xcite . then at a given frequency the normalized power spectrum of scox-1 in fig .",
    "[ xrpsh ] would be shifted downwards by a factor @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the fluctuating accretion luminosity .",
    "the figure suggests that this factor is @xmath15 , so we infer that in scox-1 about @xmath16 of the mean x - ray luminosity comes from the surface of the neutron star .",
    "a natural interpretation of the data in fig .  [ xrpsh ] is that , apart from steady emission of the neutron star in scox-1 , the x - ray emission of all four sources is produced by the same , mildly fluctuating , mechanism .",
    "this mechanism produces radio luminosity that fluctuates with similar amplitude ( although not necessarily with the same phase ) as the x - ray luminosity . on top of this baseline activity",
    ", some strongly variable process contributes to the radio luminosity but not to the x - ray luminosity .",
    "a few percent of the time , the radio luminosities of grs1915 + 105 and cygx-3 are completely dominated by this second process .",
    "the radio luminosity of scox-1 is more rarely dominated by the second process , while the radio luminosity of cygx-1 never is .",
    "this difference in the radio properties of the sources is apparent from fig .",
    "[ cumul ] , which shows the fraction of the time each source spends above any given radio luminosity .",
    "there is only a one percent probability of finding cygx-1 more luminous than twice its median luminosity , while there is about the same chance of catching cygx-3 with a radio luminosity 70 times the median value .",
    "[ subh ] reinforces the picture that two distinct modes contribute to radio activity by showing that most of the cluster of low - luminosity events in grs1915 + 105 can be accounted for by subtracting the histogram of radio events in cygx-1 after shifting it horizontally and scaling it vertically but not horizontally .",
    "a similar subtraction of the data for cygx-1 works only slightly less well in the case of cygx-3 .",
    "thus all three black - hole candidates have extremely similar distributions of low - luminosity radio events .",
    "the three microquasars that have strong radio variability are observed to have intermittent relativistic jets : grs1915 + 105 @xcite , cygx-3 @xcite and scox-1 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is no compelling evidence that cygx-1 has ever produced relativistic jets : some elongated radio features are plausibly interpreted as indicative of outflow @xcite , but existing data do not warrant the claim that it is relativistic .",
    "certainly , flares in the radio light curve of cygx-1 are extremely rare @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that in jet - producing microquasars , the mechanical luminosity of the jets probably dominates the total energy output of the system regardless of the system s state .",
    "thus changes in the system s luminosity are expected to be closely coupled to changes in the rate at which energy is carried outwards by jets .",
    "moreover , episodes of enhanced radio luminosity are quickly followed by episodes in which fast - moving knots of emission are seen in radio images @xcite .",
    "while x - ray emission from quasars is invariably a core phenomenon , radio emission from quasars sometimes extends over many kiloparsecs and involves extended radio lobes , that are generally agreed to be powered by relativistic jets .",
    "we think it is helpful to define radio - loud quasars to be those with extended radio emission , and radio - quiet quasars to be those with at most compact radio emission .",
    "since x - ray emission is invariably a core phenomenon , it can be closely coupled with total radio luminosity only in radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this consideration strongly suggests a parallel between radio - loudness in quasars and the flaring mode in microquasars , and hence an association of radio - quiet quasars with non - flaring states of microquasars ( either low / hard or high / soft ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the proposed association of radio - quiet agn with high / soft states @xcite , but it conflicts with the suggested association @xcite of fri radio sources with low / hard states .",
    "we suggest that the radio emission in quasars that is associated with the coupled mode , is confined to what is referred to as the core emission from quasars , and is most readily detectable at ghz frequencies .",
    "indeed , this core emission is observed from many quasars classified as radio - quiet @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the ` flaring ' mode leads to the formation of the large - scale ( @xmath17 ) jets that are the hallmark of radio - loud quasars , be they fris or friis .",
    "the radio luminosity to which jets give rise may be proportionally smaller in microquasars than in radio galaxies because the ambient medium around microquasars may not provide a working surface on which a jet can randomize its bulk kinetic energy to produce hot spots , as happens in the case of a radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus the near - perfect scaling of black hole accretion from microquasar to quasar is broken by a failure of the environment to scale in the same way , with the result that equivalent enhancements in the jet power of a microquasar and a quasar do not produce equivalent enhancements in the radio luminosity .    this failure of perfect scaling",
    "should be borne in mind when comparing the fraction of quasars that are radio - loud with the fraction of the time that a typical microquasar is flaring . specifically we should set the threshold in radio luminosity at which we deem a microquasar to be flaring at a smaller multiple of the median luminosity than the ratio of the median radio luminosities of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars",
    ". the chosen threshold should be large enough that it excludes all states in which the radio and x - ray luminosities are coupled . the data for cygx-1 , in which flaring is extremely rare @xcite , together with fig .",
    "[ subh ] which demonstrates the similarity in all microquasars of the radio emission associated with the coupled mode , suggests that a suitable threshold is three times the median luminosity .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ cumul ] show that grs1915 + 105 is over this threshold 21 percent of the time , while the corresponding time fractions for cygx-3 and scox-1 are 10 and 3 percent , respectively .",
    "@xcite find that 8 per cent of the bright ( @xmath18 ) sloan quasars are radio - loud in the sense that the ratio @xmath19 of radio to x - ray flux exceeds unity .",
    "in addition , the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "2 in @xcite shows that the distribution of @xmath19 is bimodal .",
    "this distribution is qualitatively similar to the distribution of the radio to x - ray flux from grs1915 + 105 we show in fig .  1 .",
    "in detail the distribution of @xmath19 in @xcite is wider , but this finding is consistent with the expected higher efficiency of quasars in producing high radio luminosity .    in this picture , it is not surprising that the black - hole mass to radio luminosity relation for agn is observed to have a large scatter at fixed black - hole mass @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the radio luminosity function of agn will be dominated by the effects of variability @xcite .",
    "the presented data indicate that two distinct modes of energy output are at work in microquasars : one producing relatively steady radio emission coupled with x - ray emission , the other responsible for strongly variable , flaring radio emission , apparently decoupled from the x - ray emission .",
    "these two types of radio emission have been referred to in the literature as ` steady jets ' and ` transient jets ' , respectively .",
    "whether the physical circumstances of these phenomena are the same as one another is still debated and is made less likely by our findings . in particular it may be premature to assume that the steady / coupled emission is generated by a jet as the transient / flaring emission is .",
    "phenomenological studies yield information that may help us to answer this question .",
    "coupled radio emission is characteristic of the low / hard x - ray state .",
    "flares often occur during a switch from the low / hard to the high / soft state .",
    "steady radio emission has a flat or inverted radio spectrum and small lorentz factors , while flaring activity has often optically thin synchrotron spectrum and lorentz factors @xmath20 @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", there is a natural dichotomy in that energy may be extracted either from the accretion disk , or from the black hole s",
    "spin @xcite .",
    "the observation that both the coupled and flaring mechanisms are active in the neutron - star powered source scox-1 indicates that neither mechanism is associated with the extraction of energy from black - hole spin , as also pointed out by @xcite who observed an ultra - relativistic outflow from the neutron - star microquasar cirx-1 .    in a plausible physical picture ,",
    "the coupled mode comprises emission from a dense non - thermal plasma at the base of a steady outflow from the system @xcite , while the flaring mode comprises emission from a shocked relativistic outflow at significant distance from the binary .",
    "the highly relativistic electrons produced in these shocks are much less likely to produce x - ray photons by the inverse - compton process than are electrons at the base of the flow , because the ambient density of photons rapidly diminishes with distance from the accretion disk .",
    "consequently , synchrotron emission from a flare is associated with negligible inverse - compton radiation , and the flare is evident only at radio frequencies .",
    "histograms of the x - ray and radio power from four microquasars show similar pronounced peaks at the low - power ends of the distributions . in three of the four histograms of radio power",
    ", there is a long tail to high luminosity that is lacking in the x - ray histograms .",
    "we interpret this finding as indicating that two modes are active in these systems .",
    "the ` coupled ' mode fluctuates only mildly and produces both x - rays and radio power .",
    "the ` flaring ' mode is highly variable , and produces exclusively radio power .",
    "even though the flaring mode is active only a few percent of the time , it typically dominates the mean radio - luminosity of the system .    what we refer to in this paper as the coupled mode",
    "comprises , in the picture of @xcite , radiation by a dense non - thermal plasma that usually occupies a hole at the centre of the accretion disk , while the flaring mode comprises synchrotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated when the residue of this plasma is expelled at relativistic speed as the hole in disk is intermittently filled in .",
    "the absence of significant x - ray emission during these episodes is natural if the electrons are shock accelerated far from the accretion disk .",
    "it seems likely that radio - quiet quasars are the analogues of microquasars that are currently not flaring .",
    "this interpretation implies that all radio - quiet quasars should display the radio emission characteristic of the coupled mechanism .",
    "there are indications that this is indeed the case , in that sensitive observations of radio - quiet quasars do reveal core radio emission for example the sample of palomar - green radio - quiet quasars observed with milli - arcsec resolution by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fraction @xmath21 of quasars that are radio - loud should be the same as the fraction of the time in which a typical microquasar has a ratio of radio to x - ray flux densities that is above an appropriate threshold .",
    "results from the sdss @xcite indicate that @xmath22 , which is consistent with the mean fraction of the time that the three flaring microquasars are radio - flare - dominated .",
    "the apparent absence of extended low - frequency radio lobes associated with radio - quiet quasars ( left - over from a putative previous radio - loud phase ) does _ not _ conflict with this picture , given the short radiative lifetimes of synchrotron particles in extending lobes when all plasma loss mechanisms are properly accounted for ( blundell & rawlings  2000 ) .",
