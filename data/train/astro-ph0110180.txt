    "the final stage of the inspiral and the subsequent coalescence of a neutron star binary system is among the prime candidates for ground based gravitational wave detection via the laser interferometers currently under construction such as ligo @xcite , tama @xcite , virgo @xcite and geo @xcite .",
    "the neutron star merger scenario could also provide the energy reservoirs to power cosmological gamma ray bursts ( grb ; @xcite ) and is in addition one of the two most discussed production sites of the heavy , rapid neutron capture elements @xcite . whether this scenario can fulfil all these promises or not , neutron star binary systems are known to exist and to inevitably coalesce @xcite .",
    "this fact alone - apart from all further promises - justifies a careful study of the coalescence process and its possible implications .",
    "+ the coalescence is an intrinsically three - dimensional phenomenon and therefore analytical guidance is rare although very welcome and one has to resort to large scale computations .",
    "additional complications arise from the fact that there is almost no field of astrophysics that does not enter at some stage during the coalescence process : the last stages and the merger are certainly dominated by strong - field general relativistic gravity , the neutron star material follows the laws of hydrodynamics , particle physics enters via possible condensates of `` exotic '' matter in the high - density interiors of the neutron stars and the copiously produced neutrinos in the hot and dense neutron star debris , questions concerning element formation require detailed information on nuclear structure and reactions ( often far from stability ) to be included and also magnetic fields might play a decisive role since they may , via transport of angular momentum , determine whether and/or when the central , coalesced object collapses into a black hole . + due to this complexity current investigations follow one of two `` orthogonal '' lines : either ignoring microphysics , resorting to the simplest equations of state ( eos ) , polytropes , and thereby focusing on solving the complicated set of general relativistic fluid dynamics equations ( or some approximation to it ) or , along the other line , using newtonian self - gravity of the fluid and investigating the influences of detailed microphysics and relating the merger event to astrophysical phenomena . +",
    "many groups have performed 3d calculations of the merger scenario .",
    "the first work , using a polytropic eos and newtonian gravity , was performed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) using eulerian finite difference codes .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method ( sph ) to further explore various aspects of the scenario .",
    "+ the strong - field gravity aspect of the event was explored again by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) using post - newtonian hydrodynamics in eulerian formulation .",
    "recently , post - newtonian calculations have also been performed using sph by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several groups have worked on general relativistic formulations where the metric has been treated in the conformal flatness approximation @xcite .",
    "recently , much progress has been made towards a stable implementation of the fully relativistic equations of hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "+ the line relying on ( basically ) newtonian gravity and investigating the microphysics of the event has been explored by @xcite and @xcite using a grid code based on the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) and by @xcite using sph .",
    "+ in this paper we want to continue to explore the impact of the microphysics on the outcome of the coalescence .",
    "we use a new equation of state that overcomes previous restrictions in the temperature and density .",
    "since the high density regime of the nuclear physics is only poorly known to date this work will unfortunately not provide the final answer , but further broaden our understanding of the large effects that can be expected from the nuclear physics input .",
    "the calculations to be described below were performed on parallel computers allowing for an unprecedented hydrodynamic resolution . + the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the basic ingredients like the hydrodynamics or the equation of state of our model .",
    "section 3 describes the initial conditions of our calculations , the overall hydrodynamic evolution , and then focuses on aspects concerning the central object and the debris , referred to as `` disk '' .",
    "the summary and a discussion of the results are provided in section 4 .",
    "to follow the dynamical evolution of the neutron star fluid we use a lagrangian particle scheme , the so - called smoothed particle hydrodynamics method ( sph ; @xcite ) .",
    "since it is independent of any prescribed geometry ( e.g. grid ) it is perfectly suited to handle the intrinsically three - dimensional merger process .",
    "in addition , the lagrangian nature of the scheme makes it easy to carefully track the evolution of interesting portions of the fluid ( e.g. possible ejecta ) .",
    "voids are treated in a natural way ( i.e. no particles ) and do not present any difficulty for the method , the interesting parts of the simulation do not have to be embedded in an artificial background medium like in other methods ( e.g. ppm ) .",
    "the use of a background medium leads to further difficulties like emerging ( artificial ) shock waves at the stellar surfaces that have to be treated by additional remedies @xcite .",
    "if the corresponding parameters are not chosen carefully , the artificial medium may also lead to a damping of ( physical ) oscillations @xcite .",
    "since sph is well - known we will only describe the basic ingredients of our code .",
    "the basic set of equations may be found in @xcite . rather than the `` standard '' form of _ artificial viscosity _",
    "( av ; @xcite ) we use a hybrid method that profits from two improvements : the viscosity parameters are time dependent @xcite and have non - negligible values only in the presence of shocks .",
    "additionally , a switch is applied that suppresses spurious forces in pure shear flows @xcite .",
    "this hybrid method @xcite has been shown to resolve shocks with the same accuracy as the standard formulation of av , but exhibits much better behaviour in shear flows . in test calculations of differentially rotating stars",
    "the viscous time scales @xmath5 obtained with the new scheme were two orders of magnitude longer than those from the standard form of av . for details and test calculations",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "+ since it is a widespread belief that sph is always extremely viscous by nature , we want to measure the effective `` alpha - viscosity '' , @xmath6 , defined by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath9 the sound velocity and @xmath10 the disk thickness . in 3d the sph bulk viscosity parameter , @xmath11 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , can be related to the kinematic viscosity via ( @xcite ) @xmath12 where h is the smoothing length . due to the modifications in our hybrid",
    "av - scheme we use @xmath13 in the above formula rather than the bulk viscosity parameter of particle @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "here @xmath16 is the balsara - factor implemented in our code , @xmath17 .",
    "this factor suppresses av in pure shear flows ( @xmath18 for @xmath19 ) where it is unwanted , and @xmath20 in the case of pure shocks ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "equating ( [ shakura ] ) and ( [ james ] ) one finds @xmath22 i.e. apart from the numerical value @xmath23 it is the resolution of the disk that determines the effective alpha - viscosity @xmath6 .",
    "it should , however , be noted that this relation is only approximate since the effects of av and the @xmath11-viscosity prescription are not necessarily exactly the same and due to the way the balsara - factor is taken into account . to obtain numerical values",
    "we insert the average thickness of the central object and disk of run b ( see below ; table [ runs ] ) into equation ( [ a_sph ] ) . by averaging according to @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the particle masses",
    ", we find @xmath26 for details of concerning `` debris '' and `` central object '' see below .",
    "these values are very low in comparison with the values that are derived from observations of cataclysmic variables , @xmath27 , and it is certainly possible that the physical viscosity of a hot neutron star debris disk is much higher than the values of the above determined numerical viscosity .",
    "+ the ( newtonian ) forces of the _ self - gravity _ of the fluid are efficiently calculated using a binary tree @xcite . since the computationally most expensive part of the code is the evaluation of gravitational forces we implemented an _ integrator _ for the set of differential equations that only needs one force evaluation per time step .",
    "we decided to implement an adams - bashforth method which is third order accurate in time .",
    "this allows for a very accurate conservation of energy and angular momentum even with relative large step sizes . in a calculation with @xmath28 100 000 particles",
    "these quantities are conserved to a few parts in @xmath29 over @xmath28 10000 time steps . for reasons of comparison : other schemes @xcite lose up to 10 @xmath30 of the total angular momentum by numerical artifacts despite excellent energy conservation . +",
    "the amount of noise present in sph depends , of course , on the particle distribution . for the worst case , a stochastic particle distribution , it scales like @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of neighbours a particle interacts with . therefore while increasing the total particle number , @xmath33 , one should also increase the number of neighbours in order to reduce the noise level . on the other hand one",
    "is not interested in too large an increase of the neighbour number and therefore the smoothing length , @xmath34 , since it would compromise the spatial resolution and the numerical error ; remember that the sph - equations are accurate to order @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 should increase slower than n. in the calculations presented here typical neighbour numbers are 100 - 120 .",
    "+ our whole code is parallelized for use on shared memory machines using openmp . for particle numbers above @xmath28 400 000",
    "we find an almost linear speedup for up to 120 processors .",
    "the forces emerging from the emission of gravitational waves that drive the binary towards coalescence are treated in the point mass limit of the quadrupole approximation and are applied until the stars come into contact .",
    "since each particle in a star is subject to the same back - reaction force the conservation of the fluid circulation is guaranteed .",
    "for a further discussion of this approach we refer to @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is one of the most crucial ingredients of a neutron star simulation and the microscopic behaviour of matter decisively determines the overall , macroscopic evolution of the system ( compare , for example , the calculations using a polytrope versus those with the nuclear eos of @xcite [ ls - eos ] in @xcite ) . since the stiffness of the eos varies over a wide range as a function of density , temperature and composition ( see below ) and the release of nuclear binding energy when nucleons form nuclei has important dynamical consequences , a simple polytropic eos is only a poor approximation of the involved microphysics .",
    "all neutron star merger calculations that used a nuclear equation of state @xcite relied on the lattimer - swesty - eos .",
    "this eos , however , has been designed for the use in supernova - calculations and therefore suffers from some deficiencies in our context : the electron fraction , @xmath36 , is restricted to values above @xmath37 , temperatures to values above @xmath38 k and densities above @xmath39 gcm  @xmath40 . the electron fraction in a neutron star in @xmath41-equilibrium ,",
    "however , dips down to values of @xmath42 near the neutron star surface ( see below ) and temperatures in old neutron stars are expected to be negligible with respect to typical nuclear energies ; viscous heating during the inspiral is expected to increase the temperatures to only @xmath43 k @xcite . therefore , once outside the eos - range , these investigations either used extrapolation @xcite or kept the eos - quantities at the boundary values @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we use an eos based on the tables of @xcite that overcomes all above mentioned restrictions , in the electron fraction as well as in temperature and density .",
    "shen et al .",
    "follow a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach which reproduces the basic features of more complicated relativistic dirac - brckner - hartree - fock calculations .",
    "the starting point is a relativistically covariant lagrangian that contains , apart from the nucleon fields , the scalar @xmath44 , and the @xmath45 and @xmath46 vector mesons . for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 meson fields non - linear terms",

    "is chosen in a way that experimental data of finite nuclei in the ground as well as in excited states are satisfactorily reproduced . with",
    "this parameter set the compression modulus , @xmath47 , has a value of 281 mev , whereas in the lattimer - swesty eos in @xcite , @xcite and all comparisons in this paper @xmath48 mev has been used . since many - body interactions at high densities are only poorly constrained to date , no effort is made to include more `` exotic '' physics such as hyperons , various mesons or quark matter in the high density regime .",
    "+ at densities above @xmath49 protons and neutrons form a homogeneous `` nucleon fluid '' , below this density matter may become inhomogeneous , i.e. the presence of nuclei may become energetically favorable .",
    "this phase is modelled using the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "matter is assumed to consist of a mixture of nucleons , alpha - particles and spherical nuclei arranged on a lattice .",
    "the heavy nucleus ( representative of a distribution of heavy nuclei ) is assumed to be centered in a charge neutral cell consisting of vapor of the neutrons , protons and alpha particles . above @xmath50 g cm  @xmath40 the nucleons",
    "are treated by the rmf theory , below this density they are assumed to form a maxwell - boltzmann gas .",
    "the alpha - particles are treated as a non - interacting boltzmann gas , their occupied volume is accounted for in the calculation of the free energies .",
    "the density distribution in the wigner - seitz cell is parametrized and the free parameters are determined by minimizing the free energy density with respect to the densities of all ingredients .",
    "+ shen et al . only provide the baryonic part of the eos .",
    "their tables range from 0 to 100 mev in temperature , 0 to @xmath28 0.56 in @xmath36 and 5.1 to 15.4 in @xmath51 ) ( @xmath46 in cgs - units ) .",
    "we therefore add the contributions from photons and electron - positron pairs to the baryonic components . for the electron - positron pairs we use the code of @xcite .",
    "apart from disregarding interactions , which is perfectly justified at the high densities of interest , the electron - positron - pairs are treated in full generality without any approximation . in the low density regime ,",
    "@xmath52 g cm  @xmath40 , we extend the eos with a gas consisting of neutrons , alpha - particles , electron - positron pairs and photons . the smooth transition is demonstrated in figure [ press_ext ] .",
    "the eos described above is tabulated with 32 entries in temperature , 72 in electron fraction and 151 in density .",
    "we store the following quantities : total pressure , internal energy , difference in the nucleonic chemical potentials @xmath53 , sound velocity , entropy , mass fractions of protons ( @xmath54 ) , alpha particles ( @xmath55 ) and the heavy nucleus ( @xmath56 ) , the proton to nucleon ratio , @xmath57 , and the nucleon number @xmath58 of the heavy nucleus .",

    "the pressure curves for different temperatures converge indicating the diminishing relevance of thermal pressure contributions .",
    "again , the shen et al .",
    "eos yields considerably higher pressure values .",
    "+ the shen - eos also yields larger values for @xmath53 .",
    "since the neutrino - less @xmath41-equilibrium value of the electron chemical potential is given by @xmath64 , @xmath65 being the neutron proton mass difference , and @xmath36 is a monotonic function of @xmath66 the shen - eos yields higher values for @xmath36 than the ls - eos .",
    "the emission of neutrinos provides a very efficient cooling mechanism for hot neutron star matter and the related electron and positron captures change the electron fraction @xmath36 which in turn determines the matter composition .",
    "we include the most important neutrino reactions where we ensure , via effective rates , that only the amount of neutrinos is produced that is actually able to leave the dense surrounding material .",
    "our scheme takes careful account of the energy dependence of the neutrino opacities by integrating over the neutrino distributions .",
    "+ for the emission processes we include electron captures ( ec ) @xmath67 and positron captures ( pc ) @xmath68 which produce electron flavour neutrinos and the pair producing reactions , pair annihilation @xmath69 and plasmon decay @xmath70 here @xmath71 refer to anti-/neutrinos of all types .",

    "binary systems can become dynamically unstable ( i.e. they coalesce on a _ dynamical _ time scale ) due to entirely newtonian tidal effects @xcite .",
    "this means that orbital decay changes abruptly from the secular orbital decay driven by the emission of gravitational waves to a rapid plunging of both components towards each other on just the orbital time scale .",
    "the reason for this instability is the steeping of the effective interaction potential between both components due to tidal effects .",

    "the systems start immediately to shed hot material with rather low density from the interaction region .",
    "this is closely followed by mass shedding via the outer lagrangian points .",

    "since the inspiral behaviour changes qualitatively at this point from a quasi - stationary , quasi - periodic motion to a dynamic `` plunge '' towards each other the gravitational wave signal will change correspondingly at this point . for a corotating system of 1.4 m@xmath77",

    "+ once the neutron stars come into contact a kelvin - helmholtz unstable vortex sheet forms between both stars leading to the formation of vortex rolls . in the case of an initially corotating system two such vortices form which remain present and well - separated until the end of the calculation . in the more important irrotational case , several vortices form which merge within an orbital time scale leaving behind a differentially rotating central object .",
    "it is within these vortex roles that the highest temperatures of the merged configuration are found , reaching peak values of 30 mev for the case of an irrotational system , while in the corotating case only a moderate temperature increase is observed . in a test calculation using two stars of 2.0 m@xmath77 temperatures of up to 45 mev",

    "we find generally comparable but slightly lower temperatures than previous investigations that used the lattimer - swesty eos .",
    "+    the disks have a vertical height comparable to their radial extension .",
    "we find the vertical disk structure to be determined by an equatorial inflow of cool material that becomes shock heated in the innermost , dense disk regime .",
    "this goes along with an outflow of hot material in the vertical direction . in the dense inner torus around the central object we find temperatures of 3 - 4 mev as compared to 5 - 10 mev in the lattimer - sesty case . despite the high temperatures we find a substantial amount ( a mass fraction of @xmath158 ) of heavy nuclei present even in the inner parts of the torus",
    "this is enough to dominate the neutrino scattering opacities which therefore play a crucial role for the neutrino transport .",
    "this has important consequences for the enormously temperature sensitive neutrino reactions and will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "+ the masses of the central objects are roughly 0.1 m@xmath77 lower than in previous calculations where we used the lattimer - swesty - eos , leading to masses of the central object that are comparable to the maximum masses that most recent nuclear equations of state can support for cold , non - rotating configurations . since several stabilizing effects like thermal pressure contributions , rotation and , most likely , magnetic fields are active during the coalescence , we suspect the central object will remain stable on at least the simulation time scale of 20 ms .",
    "probably the most important stabilisation comes from differential rotation . for the most probable case , where the neutron star spins are negligible with respect to the orbital motion",

    "can not be drawn .",
