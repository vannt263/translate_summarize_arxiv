    "the evolutionary study of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is now one of the most active fields in astrophysics .",
    "especially , the cosmic reionization history of the igm attracts many researchers in recent years ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "peterson trough shortward of the ly@xmath4 resonance @xcite in the spectrum of quasars with redshift @xmath5 indicates that the end of the reionization epoch is @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the recent observation of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by _ wmap _ suggests that the beginning of the reionization is @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one might think that there is a discrepancy between both observations .",
    "the detailed simulation of the six - dimensional radiative transfer shows that the reionization process proceeds slowly in an inhomogeneous universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the reionization began at @xmath7 , the neutral fraction in the universe decreased gradually , and the universe was ionized almost completely at @xmath5 , the apparent discrepancy can be resolved @xcite .",
    "the scenario that the initial partially ionized epoch was simply followed by the complete ionization can explain the large thomson scattering opacity observed from the cmb polarization and also is consistent with the previous picture in which the end of the reionization is @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite recently proposed a new scenario of the reionization ; the universe was reionized twice . even in an inhomogeneous universe ,",
    "enough strong intensity of the ultra - violet ( uv ) background radiation can ionize the universe quickly . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the first reionization was made by the population iii ( pop iii ) stars ( metal - free stars ) with a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) which yields a much higher uv emissivity than that of normal pop i and ii stars .",
    "then , the universe was partially recombined at @xmath8 when the transition from the pop iii to ii was occurred and the uv emissivity was suddenly suppressed because of the different imf . finally , the uv photons from the pop ii stars increased gradually and ionized the universe again at @xmath5 .",
    "cen s scenario can also resolve the discrepancy , but it is different from others in the history of the cosmic reionization ; the first complete ionization was followed by the partially ionized epoch and then the second complete ionization .",
    "we should assess whether cen s scenario is favored by using other observations . in this paper ,",
    "an assessment by using the afterglows of the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is discussed .",
    "the usefulness of grbs to investigate the high-@xmath2 universe is pointed out by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is strongly suggested that the long duration grbs arise from the collapse of a massive star @xcite .",
    "hence , the grbs can occur at very high-@xmath2 once the massive stars are formed .",
    "for example , the _ swift _ satellite is expected to detect @xmath9 grbs per year occurring at @xmath10 @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if we fix an observing time from the prompt emission , the observed afterglow flux does not become so faint even for the extremely high-@xmath2 grbs because the earlier phase of the afterglow is observed in the cosmological rest frame @xcite .    in this paper , we show that the near - infrared ( nir ) photometric follow - ups of the grb afterglows are very useful to investigate how many times the cosmic reionization occurred .",
    "although many techniques to prove the reionization history have been proposed so far , for example , hydrogen 21 cm line tomography @xcite , ly@xmath4 damping wing measurement @xcite , metal absorption lines @xcite , cmb polarization anisotropy @xcite , and dispersion measure in grb radio afterglows @xcite , the nir photometric colors may be the most promising technique using the _ current _ facilities .    in order to investigate the reionization history using our photometric method",
    ", we need to determine redshifts of grbs by other ways , e.g. , detections of iron lines in x - ray afterglow spectra @xcite and of the ly@xmath4 break in nir spectra , or empirical methods by using only the @xmath11-ray data @xcite .",
    "even if redshifts of grbs are unknown prior to follow - up observations , it is worth performing nir photometry as early phase as possible since @xmath9% of grbs are expected to be located at @xmath10 @xcite . in practice ,",
    "such follow - up observations against every grb are possible .",
    "even after the early nir follow - up , we will be able to determine the redshifts .",
    "in this paper , we show that the near - infrared ( nir ) photometric follow - ups of the grb afterglows provide a significantly important information on the cosmic reionization history .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : we start from a brief summary of the igm opacity by the neutral hydrogen in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "the possible scenario of a very low neutral fraction at very high-@xmath2 is discussed .",
    "then , we examine the nir spectra and colors of the grb afterglows in section 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "finally , we discuss a way to obtain the cosmic reionization history and advantage / disadvantage of our method in section 6 .",
    "we adopt a standard set of the @xmath12cdm cosmology throughout the paper : @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "suppose an observer at @xmath18 who observes a source with @xmath19 at the observer s frequency @xmath20 .",
    "the radiation from the source is absorbed by the lyman series lines and the photoionization of the intervening neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen cross section at the rest frame frequency @xmath21 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cross section for the lyman continuum photons ( @xmath24 13.6 ev ) and @xmath25 is the cross section for the @xmath26-th line of the lyman series , i.e. , @xmath27 ly@xmath4 , ly@xmath28 , ly@xmath11 , etc . here",

    ", @xmath34 is the hubble constant at the redshift @xmath2 , and @xmath35 is the light speed .    the cross section for the lyman continuum photons is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 @xmath38 and the lyman limit frequency @xmath39 hz @xcite .",

    "the effect of the inhomogeneity of the universe can be expressed in the definition of @xmath46 ( see section 3 below ) . since we need the condition @xmath47 to integrate eq .",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "the line cross section @xmath25 has a very sharp peak at the line center frequency .",
    "the width is well characterized by the doppler width , @xmath50 .",
    "that is , @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the cross section and the frequency of the @xmath26-th line center , respectively .",
    "since @xmath57 , we integrate the rhs of equation ( 4 ) over a narrow redshift width of @xmath58 around @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath60    \\left[\\frac{c n_{\\rm hi}(z_i)}{h(z_i)}\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] where we have substituted @xmath61 , in which @xmath62 is the electric charge , @xmath63 is the absorption oscillator strength of the @xmath26-th line , and @xmath64 is the electron mass .",
    "the values of @xmath63 and @xmath56 are taken from @xcite .",
    "this time also we are restricted by @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the above equation is valid only when @xmath66 , otherwise @xmath67 .    for the ly@xmath4 line ,",
    "the opacity becomes @xmath68 where we approximate @xmath69 and adopt @xmath70 .",
    "this is the gunn - peterson optical depth @xcite . from this equation",
    ", we realize that if @xmath71 , the igm is opaque for the photon bluer than the source ly@xmath4 line .",
    "conversely , we can estimate @xmath46 if @xmath72 is determined observationally ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in the following sections , we will assume a neutral fraction of hydrogen , @xmath73 at @xmath6 for calculations of spectra and colors of grb afterglows . before such calculations",
    ", we show , here , that @xmath74 is possible at a very high-@xmath2 universe .. however , it is an artificial limit in his calculation ( cen 2003 , private communication ) . ]    in general , the neutral fraction , @xmath41 , is spatially variable .",
    "however , we discuss only its mean value for simplicity . the averaged @xmath46 is determined by the uv intensity of the background radiation and the inhomogeneity of the hydrogen number density at the redshift @xmath2 . even at very high-@xmath2 universe ,",
    "the recombination time - scale is much less than the hubble time - scale .",
    "thus , we assume the ionization equilibrium . in that case , the mean neutral fraction for a highly ionized medium ( i.e. @xmath75 ) is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the clumping factor , @xmath78 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath4 is the recombination coefficient , and @xmath79 is the hi photoionization rate where @xmath80 is the photon number density per frequency .",
    "therefore , the uv background intensity is required to estimate @xmath46 even if we know the clumping factor from the model of the cosmological structure formation .",
    "how much photons are required to control the hydrogen neutral fraction in a very low level ?",
    "approximately , the hi photoionization rate is estimated to be @xmath81 with @xmath82 being the number density of ionizing photons .",
    "hence , we find @xmath83 where the case b recombination rate @xmath84 @xmath85 s@xmath14 is adopted @xcite .",
    "now , we are interested in a very high redshift universe ( @xmath86 ) . in there",
    ", the clumping factor is an order of unity .",
    "therefore , we find that only one photon per a hydrogen nuclei is sufficient to keep @xmath73 .",
    "then , we examine how much stars are required to maintain the photon density . since a proton recombines with an electron in a certain time - scale , continuous supply of ionizing photons",
    "is needed to keep @xmath87 .",
    "since the recombination time - scale is @xmath88 for @xmath75 , the required photon emissivity per unit volume is estimated to be @xmath89 .",
    "on the other hand , the emissivity is given by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the escape fraction of lyman continuum from primordial galaxies , @xmath92 is the lyman continuum photon emissivity per unit stellar mass , and @xmath93 is the star formation density per unit time per unit comoving volume .",
    "therefore , the required star formation density is @xmath94    although the photon emissivity at high-@xmath2 is very uncertain because we do nt know the stellar mass distribution , we estimate the emissivity by starburst 99 model @xcite by assuming the salpeter mass function with various mass ranges .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath92 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the pop iii stars are likely to have a top - heavy mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the case of 10100 @xmath95 in table 1 may be suitable . in this case",
    ", the required star formation density to maintain @xmath96 is @xmath97 @xmath95 yr@xmath14 mpc@xmath98 ( comoving ) when @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "is this star formation density possible ?",
    "the latest observations suggest that the star formation density retains a level of @xmath101 @xmath95 yr@xmath14 mpc@xmath98 from @xmath102 to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such a level of star formation may be kept toward more high-@xmath2 universe . moreover",
    ", a semianalytic model shows 0.010.1",
    "@xmath95 yr@xmath14 mpc@xmath98 at @xmath6 depending on the assumed star formation efficiency @xcite .",
    "thus , we can sufficiently expect @xmath97 @xmath95 yr@xmath14 mpc@xmath98 , and then , @xmath96 at @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , we note that the escape fraction may be much larger than 0.1 assumed above if the pop iii stars are formed in low - mass halos .",
    "let us discuss the observed spectra of the grb afterglows in the nir bands . to do so , an afterglow spectral model is required .",
    "we adopt a simple afterglow model ; the synchrotron radiation from the relativistic shock @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we adopt equations ( 1)(5 ) in @xcite who take into account the effect of the cosmological redshift .",
    "the adopted parameters are the magnetic energy fraction of @xmath103 , the electron energy fraction of @xmath104 , the spherical shock energy of @xmath105 erg , the ambient gas number density of @xmath106 cm@xmath98 , and the power - law index of the electron energy distribution @xmath108 .",
    "first we consider the observed afterglow spectra in the hypothetical perfectly neutral universe for comparison . in figure 1 , we show the expected afterglow spectra in the neutral universe observed 1 hour after the burst in the observer s frame . due to the ly@xmath4 line absorption , the continuum bluer than the ly@xmath4 line in the source frame ( the observed wavelength 0.1216[@xmath109 ) is completely damped .",
    "thus , we can find the ly@xmath4 break clearly . from the observed wavelength of the ly@xmath4 break",
    ", we can determine the redshift of the grbs .",
    "if we observe the afterglow through a filter , the radiation from the source with the redshift higher than the characteristic redshift of the filter can not be detected because of the ly@xmath4 break .",
    "for example , the effect starts from @xmath110 for the @xmath111-band and the source with @xmath112 can not be seen through the filter , i.e. @xmath111 _ drop - out_. these characteristic redshifts are summarized in table 2 . however , we have a chance to see the source beyond the drop - out redshift if the universe is highly ionized as we will show later .",
    "next we examine what is observed if the very high-@xmath2 universe is ionized completely as proposed by @xcite .",
    "let us set the neutral fraction , @xmath46 , of the universe in the redshift range @xmath113 to be very small and @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "that is , we assume that the pop iii stars ionized the universe at @xmath117 and the sudden change of the imf due to the transition from the pop iii to ii was occurred at @xmath118 .",
    "the neutral fraction is determined by the background uv intensity produced by the pop iii stars .",
    "however , the intensity is quite uncertain , so that we choose two cases as @xmath119 and @xmath120 for instance ( see also fig.5 in section 5 ) . we will present a way to constrain @xmath46 from the observations later .    in figure 2 , we show the expected spectra of the grb afterglows .",
    "the solid , short - dashed , long - dashed , dot - dashed , and dotted curves are the expected afterglow spectra of the grb at @xmath121 , 20 , 18 , 15 , and 13 , respectively .",
    "the observing time is assumed to be 1 hour after the prompt emission in the observer s frame .",
    "we find the clear ly@xmath4 breaks in the spectra .",
    "since @xmath119 ( or @xmath120 ) at @xmath113 is assumed in the panel ( a ) ( or ( b ) ) , the igm opacity is an order of unity ( or 0.1 ) in the redshift range ( see eq.[7 ] ) .",
    "thus , the continuum bluer than the ly@xmath4 break of the grbs with @xmath122 still remains of the order of @xmath123 @xmath124jy ( or 100 @xmath124jy ) in @xmath1252.5 , i.e.,in @xmath126-band ( see the thin solid curve indicated as @xmath126 ; we adopt the filter system of @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral break at 1.94(=0.1216[1 + 15 ] )  is due to the neutral hydrogen below @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the continuum less than the break wavelength in the observer s frame from the @xmath127 source is completely extinguished .",
    "the spectra of the source with @xmath128 are the same as those shown in figure 1 . for @xmath121 case ,",
    "the spectrum shows the second break at 2.36(=0.1026[1 + 22 ] ) .",
    "this is the ly@xmath28 break due to the neutral hydrogen near the grb .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "the structure corresponding to the reionization history appears in the spectra of the grb afterglows as shown in figure 2 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if we could detect the continuum rising at 2.55(=0.1216[1 + 20 ] ) in the spectrum of the grb with @xmath121 , we would find the starting epoch of the first reionization as @xmath117 . on the other hand , the end of the first reionization , in other words , the transition epoch from the pop iii to ii is realized from the spectral break at 1.94(=0.1216[1 + 15 ] ) .    the suitable band to determine the ionization history depends on the redshift of the reionization epoch .",
    "from figure 1 ( see also table 2 ) , we find that the @xmath131 , @xmath111 , @xmath132 , and @xmath126-band spectroscopies are suitable for the reionization epoch at @xmath1337 , 811 , 1114 , and 1520 , respectively . in any case , observations to detect the spectral signatures in the nir afterglow spectra of the grbs are strongly encouraged .",
    "if @xmath46 is smaller than @xmath3 , we can clearly see the difference from fig .  1 and confirm the double reionization .",
    "in the above discussion , we assumed @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "let us argue what will happen for different values of @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath134 , the remaining flux decreases exponentially because the igm opacity becomes much larger than unity ; for example , the flux is about 1 njy for @xmath135 , and about 1 pjy for @xmath136 .",
    "it is quite difficult to detect such a low - level flux .",
    "the photometric observations are available easier than the spectroscopy .",
    "we examine the expected apparent nir colors of the grb afterglows .",
    "although we can discuss the apparent magnitude of the afterglows in one photometric filter , their dispersion is very large because the luminosity of the afterglows depends on many uncertain parameters such as the jet opening angle , the ambient matter density , the magnetic energy fraction and the relativistic electron energy fraction . on the other hand",
    ", the dispersion of the apparent colors can be quite small because the color does not depend on the absolute luminosity but only the spectral shape which does not change significantly in the observed nir bands .",
    "the apparent magnitude in a filter band denoted as @xmath26 is defined by @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the zero point flux density of the filter and @xmath139 is the mean flux density through the filter which is @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the transmission efficiency of the filter and @xmath142 is the flux density entering the filter . if there is no intervening absorber between the source and the telescope , @xmath143 .    the observed color between two filter bands , @xmath26 and @xmath144 ( the filter @xmath26 is bluer than the filter @xmath144 ) , is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the intrinsic color of the source , and @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the absorption amounts in the filters @xmath26 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "when we consider the nir filter bands and high-@xmath2 grbs ( for example @xmath118 ) , the intrinsic afterglow spectrum is predicted to be proportional to @xmath149 from @xmath150 minute to several hours after the burst occurrence and proportional to @xmath151 for later time in the standard afterglow model @xcite .",
    "other parameters adopted are described in the beginning of the section 3 . in table 3 , we tabulate the intrinsic colors of the sources for the two cases of the spectral shape .    the absorption amount in the filter @xmath26 is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the intrinsic ( no absorption ) apparent magnitude . in a certain band width",
    "@xmath154 , the difference in the optical depth @xmath155 is estimated as @xmath156 , and also @xmath157 , @xmath158 , that is , the term @xmath159 in the integral of the numerator in equation ( 13 ) can be regarded as almost constant . hence",
    ", we obtain approximately @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the effective igm opacity in the filter @xmath26 .",
    "now we can estimate the observed color by equation ( 12 ) if @xmath147 is known . to know @xmath147 is equivalent to know the igm effective opacity @xmath161 .",
    "this opacity is one between the redshift at which the ly@xmath4 break comes into the filter band width ( @xmath162 , see table 2 ) and the source redshift ( @xmath163 ) because the neutral hydrogen in @xmath164 can not absorb the photons passing through the filter @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the neutral hydrogen lying beyond the redshift at which the ly@xmath4 break goes out of the filter band width ( @xmath165 , see table 2 ) absorb the photons through the filter @xmath26 because of the higher - order lyman series lines like ly@xmath28 , ly@xmath11 , etc . , and the photoionization process .",
    "as a result , @xmath161 is determined by the neutral fraction @xmath46 in the redshift range @xmath166 . since @xmath46 at high-@xmath2 is uncertain , we assume that @xmath46 is constant in the above range for simplicity .",
    "the real @xmath46 might vary significantly in the redshift range , so that the assumed @xmath46 should be regarded as an effective mean value including such a variation ( hereafter @xmath167 ) .    in figures 3a3d ,",
    "we show @xmath147 for the @xmath131 , @xmath111 , @xmath132 , and @xmath126-bands as a function of the source redshift .",
    "the continuum in the observer s @xmath168-band is not absorbed by the igm neutral hydrogen at all when the source redshift is less than about 25 .",
    "although we assumed that the spectral shape is proportional to @xmath149 in the panels , the results are much robust for the change of the spectral shape as noted above .",
    "the solid curves in these panels are loci of @xmath147 for a given @xmath167 as a function of the source redshift @xmath163 .",
    "for example , since @xmath169 for @xmath131-band , the igm absorption in @xmath131-band is about 5 mag for the source at @xmath170 if the effective neutral fraction @xmath167 in the redshift range @xmath171 is @xmath172 .",
    "two dotted vertical lines in each panel of figure 3 indicate the redshifts when the ly@xmath4 break enters and goes out of the each band width ( @xmath162 and @xmath165 , respectively ) .",
    "as seen in figure 1 , if the igm is significantly neutral , the source with @xmath173 can not be detected through the filter @xmath26 ( i.e. _ drop - out _ ) .",
    "however , we can detect such a source if the universe is highly ionized .",
    "this is because the continuum below the ly@xmath4 break remains as shown in figure 2 .",
    "suppose we observe a source with @xmath174 through the @xmath26 and @xmath144 filters and assume that the radiation through @xmath144 filter is not affected by any intervening absorption ( i.e. @xmath175 ) . from equation ( 12 ) ,",
    "the expected magnitude through the @xmath26 filter is @xmath176 for example , we consider the case of @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath170 .",
    "we find that the apparent @xmath168 magnitude of the afterglow of the grb at @xmath170 for 1 hour after the prompt burst is about 14 mag from figure 4 .",
    "thus , the apparent @xmath131 magnitude is expected to be 22 mag because the intrinsic @xmath179 mag for 1 hour ( i.e. the case @xmath180 in table 3 ) and @xmath181 mag if @xmath182 in the redshift range @xmath171 .",
    "we can reach 5-@xmath183 detection of the source with @xmath184 mag by only three minutes exposure with a 8-m class telescope .",
    "interestingly the assumed @xmath167 is similar to the value reported by @xcite from the gunn  peterson trough in the spectra of @xmath185 quasars .",
    "similar argument can be done for other bands .",
    "therefore , in general , the detection of the source with @xmath174 through the filter @xmath26 is the very good evidence that the universe in the redshift range @xmath186 is highly ionized , i.e. @xmath187 in that redshift range .",
    "conversely , the detection enables us to estimate @xmath161 and @xmath167 .",
    "finally , we note here that figure 3 is also useful for any other sources ( e.g. , qsos ) because @xmath147 is almost independent of the source spectrum .",
    "here we discuss how we can confirm or refute cen s scenario : the universe was reionized twice . in the scenario , the first complete ionization at @xmath6",
    "is followed by the partially ionized epoch at @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , we should check whether the neutral fraction at @xmath6 is very low or not and whether the fraction at @xmath188 is almost unity or not . to do so",
    ", the best observation is the spectroscopy in the nir bands . as shown in fig . 2 of section 3",
    ", the reionization history is imprinted in the observed continuum . however",
    ", the sensitivity of the spectroscopy is in general much less than that of the photometric observations .",
    "hence we discuss the way using the nir photometries .    in the previous section",
    ", we have shown that the detection of the grb afterglows through a filter @xmath26 beyond the ly@xmath4 drop - out redshift ( @xmath165 ) proves the ionization of the universe around @xmath165 . from the characteristic redshifts for the nir filters summarized in table 2 ,",
    "the @xmath131 , @xmath111 , @xmath132 , and @xmath126 filters are the suitable to check the ionization state at @xmath1898 , 811 , 1115 , and 1520 , respectively .",
    "thus , the null detection of the grb afterglows of @xmath190 in @xmath111-band indicates an high neutral fraction in @xmath191 . on the other hand",
    ", we detect the grb afterglows of @xmath192 in @xmath126-band if the igm in @xmath193 is ionized . @xmath131 and @xmath132-band surveys are also very important to assess the reionization history of the universe .",

    ", we can examine the reionization history by checking whether the high-@xmath2 grb afterglows drop out of the nir filters or not .    in the rest of this subsection , we discuss what is the difference between cen s scenario and others . to demonstrate the main feature , we assume two schematic reionization histories ; ( 1 ) single gradual reionization and ( 2 ) double sudden reionizations , which are shown in figure 5 as the solid and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "these histories are based on two observational constraints ; ( 1 ) the neutral fraction of hydrogen @xmath195 at @xmath5 from the gunn - peterson trough found in the @xmath185 quasars spectra @xcite , and ( 2 ) the beginning of the reionization is @xmath6 from the large opacity of the electron scattering suggested by _",

    "we also consider different values of @xmath46 in the first reionization epoch .    in figure 6 , we show the expected nir colors as a function of the source redshift for the afterglow spectrum @xmath196 case ( the observing time less than several hours , see table 3 ) .",
    "we find differences between the single and double reionizations in the @xmath197 ( panel [ a ] ) and @xmath198 ( panel [ d ] ) colors . in panel",
    "( a ) , the grb afterglows up to @xmath199 can be seen in both of the @xmath131 and @xmath111 bands for the single reionization case , whereas the @xmath197 color of @xmath200 afterglows diverges in the double reionization case , i.e. the sources drop out of the @xmath131-band .",
    "this reflects the difference of the increasing rate of the neutral fraction around @xmath201 in two reionization histories .",
    "the drop - out redshift in the double reionization case is determined by @xmath202 , where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are the rest - frame wavelength of the ly@xmath4 and ly@xmath28 lines , and @xmath205 is the sudden reionization redshift @xcite . in our case ,",
    "it is worth to noting that the grb afterglows beyond the drop - out redshift of the @xmath131-band ( @xmath207 ) can be seen through the filter in both of reionization histories .    in panel",
    "( d ) of figure 6 , we find a significant difference between the two reionization scenarios .",
    "while the afterglows beyond the drop - out redshift of the @xmath126-band really drop out of the filter for the single reionization , we can see such afterglows in the twice reionized universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the afterglows with @xmath208 drop out of the @xmath126-band even in the double reionization case because the ly@xmath28 break goes out of the filter transmission width , i.e. @xmath209 $ ] , where @xmath210 is the maximum wavelength of the @xmath126-band filter .",
    "we note here that @xmath211 in this time , whereas @xmath212 in the above case .",
    "any difference between the single and double reionizations can not be found in the @xmath213 ( panel [ b ] ) and the @xmath214 ( panel [ c ] ) colors because the neutral fractions in both cases are high enough ( @xmath215 ) to extinguish the continuum bluer than the ly@xmath4 break completely .",
    "that is , the grb afterglows beyond the drop - out redshift can not be seen in the @xmath111 and @xmath132-bands for both of reionization histories .",
    "let us summarize how to confirm or refute cen s scenario : we can conclude that the universe was reionized twice if ( 1 ) the grb afterglows with @xmath216 is detected in the @xmath126-band and ( 2 ) the afterglows with @xmath217 or @xmath218 drop out of the @xmath111 or @xmath132-bands .",
    "however , the null detection of the @xmath216 grb afterglows in the @xmath126-band does not reject cen s scenario at once .",
    "the null detection only shows the neutral fraction at @xmath6 larger than @xmath219 . in any case",
    ", the deep and prompt @xmath126-band photometry of the high-@xmath2 grb afterglows is useful to examine the ionization state at @xmath6 very much .      in the above discussions",
    ", we assumed that the grb redshifts are known from other methods .",
    "although the spectroscopy of the optical afterglow or the host galaxies is used to determine the redshift of the low-@xmath2 grbs , it may be difficult for the high-@xmath2 grbs .",
    "the fe line in the x - ray afterglow @xcite or some empirical ways using the @xmath11-ray data alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be useful for the high-@xmath2 grbs .",
    "in addition , the search for the ly@xmath4 break is considered to be useful .",
    "indeed , the spectroscopic detection of the sharp ly@xmath4 cut - off ( see figs.2 and 3 ) is an accurate method to determine the redshift .",
    "however , the color selection technique which is often used to find the @xmath220 galaxies @xcite may not be good for the high-@xmath2 grbs .",
    "this is because the grb afterglows beyond the drop - out redshift of the considered filter can be detectable if the universe is ionized enough .",
    "for example , if we use @xmath221 mag as a criterion to select the high-@xmath2 grbs , the selected objects have @xmath222 indeed ( see fig.3a and table 3 )",
    ". however , a number of real @xmath222 objects escape the criterion if the neutral fraction is less than @xmath219 .",
    "therefore , we can not use a simple color selection technique for the high-@xmath2 grbs .",
    "spectroscopic observations to detect the ly@xmath4 break feature , fe line @xcite or empirical methods by using only the @xmath11-ray data @xcite are required .",
    "the largest advantage of the nir color method is its easier availability and higher sensitivity than other methods .",
    "the limiting magnitude with a high signal - to - noise ratio of the broad - band nir photometry reaches much deeper than 20 mag by only a few minute exposure with a 8-m class ground based telescope . for example , the ircs ( infrared camera and spectrograph ) equipped with the subaru telescope ( japanese 8-m class telescope ) can reach the 2-@xmath183 upper limit of 22 mag by only five minutes exposure in @xmath126-band .",
    "this magnitude corresponds to @xmath223 mag based on the expected @xmath168 magnitude of @xmath224 mag for the @xmath225 grb afterglows at 1 hour after the burst ( fig.4 ) and @xmath226 ( table 3 ) , and also corresponds to the neutral fraction of @xmath227 .",
    "thus , we can put this value as a lower limit of the neutral fraction at @xmath6 for null detection .",
    "a more strict lower limit can be obtained if we detect the emission from the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "some grbs show a very bright early afterglow from the reverse shock .",
    "interestingly , the apparent magnitude becomes @xmath2286 mag brighter than that shown in figure 4 . in this case",
    ", we can reach @xmath229 corresponding to @xmath230 .",
    "a very early observation is highly desired .    from the detected magnitude or the limiting magnitude for the null detection ,",
    "the neutral fraction or its lower limit in the corresponding redshift range can be estimated .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the obtained neutral fraction may be large if we have only one photometric data .",
    "this is because the apparent dispersion of the afterglow luminosities is large . even in that case",
    ", the uncertainty can be controlled in a low level if we use more than two photometric data , i.e. colors , which are independent of the absolute luminosity .",
    "this point is one of the important advantages of the nir color method .",
    "therefore , the nir multi - colors follow - ups of the grb afterglows are strongly encouraged .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that the detailed spectroscopy of the red damping wing of the ly@xmath4 break provides us with the optical depth for the line , i.e. , the neutral hydrogen column density to the source .",
    "however , the spectral resolution required is @xmath231 . for a lower opacity",
    ", a much higher resolving power is needed .",
    "the limiting magnitude for such observations becomes significantly shallow .",
    "that is , the method of damping wing measurement do not have sensitivity for a low opacity case . on the other hand , the nir colors method is practically sensitive against @xmath232 .",
    "therefore , these two methods are complementary each other ; if @xmath96 ( @xmath233 ) , the nir colors method becomes very useful , whereas the damping wing method is promising when @xmath234 ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "measurement of the cmb polarization anisotropy is also useful .",
    "@xcite show that we can distinguish how much times the universe is reionized by using ee spectrum with planck sensitivity in 3@xmath183 level .",
    "since the sensitivity of _ wmap _ is not enough , we must await the launch of planck to reveal the reionization history by the cmb measurement",
    ".    moreover , metal absorption lines like o i @xmath236 can be useful to prove the reionization history @xcite .",
    "however , the expected equivalent width is very small as @xmath237  .",
    "we require the spectroscopy with a resolving power @xmath238 .",
    "unfortunately , observations with a ground - based telescope may be difficult because a huge number of earth s atmospheric oh lines conceal the metal lines . only jwst ( james webb space telescope )",
    "will have such a high spectral resolution among the future space telescopes having the nir spectrograph .",
    "thus , we need to await its launch to discuss the metal absorption lines .",
    "technique using the hydrogen 21 cm absorption line is also proposed ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "however , the brightness of grb afterglows is too faint to use them as a background light source for the present and future radio facilities because the absorption line is very weak @xcite .",
    "thus , we need to look for other sources . although carilli et al .  ( 2002 ) proposed luminous high-@xmath2 radio - loud quasars as a candidate of the background source , it is very uncertain that they exist at @xmath6 .",
    "the dispersion measure in grb radio afterglows may be promising in near future @xcite .",
    "if we observe the radio afterglow at about 100 mhz within about 1000 s after the burst occurrence , the delay of the arrival time of the low frequency photons may be detectable by the square kilometer array . as well as the measurement of the red damping wing of the ly@xmath4 line ,",
    "this technique is sensitive to @xmath239 ( i.e. , @xmath240 ) .",
    "thus , this technique and our nir color method are also complementary each other .",
    "the disadvantage of the nir color method is the coarse redshift resolution .",
    "as discussed in section 4 , the neutral fraction obtained by the color method is an averaged one in the redshift range of @xmath241 .",
    "thus , we can not determine the so - called reionization redshift .",
    "only the redshift range in which the reionization occurred is obtained .",
    "however , even such a rough redshift resolution is enough to discuss whether the universe was reionized once , twice , or more .    to know the detailed history of the reionization , the spectroscopy is needed . for this purpose",
    ", the japanese astronomical satellite astro - f can be useful .",
    "the satellite will have the spectroscopic sensitivity of @xmath242 @xmath124jy around @xmath125 , which can detect the grb afterglows of @xmath192 if @xmath74 ( see fig.2a ) .",
    "sirtf ( spece infrared telescope facility ) may not be useful because it has the sensitivity only in the wavelength longer than 5 . in future , jwst is much promising .",
    "finally , we note that the narrow - band photometry may be useful because its narrow transmission width provides us with a moderate resolution of redshift keeping a higher sensitivity than that of spectroscopy .",
