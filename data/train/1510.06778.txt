    "in contrast , electrons throughout a biased superlattice may occupy quasibound states , with no simple relationship between the particle energy and wave vector . considering that the rates derived based on fermi s golden rule rely on a well - defined kinetic energy pre- and post - scattering , it is clear that a boltzmann collision integral fails to capture scattering in superlattices .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce a model collision integral suitable for analyzing dissipative quantum transport in superlattices within the wigner function formalism .",

    "the choice of smoothed barriers can also be justified by physical reasoning : the lattice constant of gaas is about @xmath60  nm , which sets the length scale for the most abrupt variation in the conduction band profile .",
    "we solve the wte   by using a particle - based method with affinities  @xcite .",

    "we note that by including the collision term in the time evolution of affinities , the particle method is entirely deterministic , and does not require discretization of the rapidly oscillating diffusive term , which is difficult to deal with using a finite difference method  @xcite .    in order to simulate superlattices ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are implemented by simply removing particles when they exit the simulation domain and injecting them with the same wave vector at the other side .",
    "this approach is valid as long as the simulation domain is large enough that the coherences are not artificially cut off @xcite .",
    "this condition is tested by increasing the number of simulated periods until the simulation converges , typically 100 nm ( two periods ) .",
    "a good choice of the initial state @xmath69 is important for faster convergence to a steady state , as well as to ensure the steady - state wf is a valid wf  @xcite . here",
    ", we will note that , given a valid initial state , the wf will remain valid at later times as long as the model collision integral does not violate the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "in this work , we choose the thermal equilibrium wf as the initial state .",
    "the steady state is reached in @xmath70  ps , after which the simulation is continued for additional @xmath71  ps to calculate averages of physical observables , such as the current density .",
    "in this section , we take a closer look at the collision integral @xmath22 $ ] for the wigner transport equation , because superlattices pose challenges that are not nearly as dire when addressing other common structures .",
    "thus far , considerable work has been done on resonant - tunneling diodes ( rtds ) using the wigner transport equation @xcite .",
    "this structure has a relatively small region where tunneling or the formation of bound states is important , and where the relationship between @xmath34 and the kinetic energy can not be written .",
    "therefore , throughout most of the simulation domain , the concept of the kinetic energy is well defined and the use of the scattering rates based on fermi s golden rule is justified .",
    "in contrast , in superlattices , tunneling and quasibound - state formation are important in the entirety of the structure , and the rates calculated based on fermi s golden rule can not be reliably used . employing these rates for superlattices can result in unphysically high currents and negative particle densities .",
    "for example , with the use of the common rates for all standard scattering mechanisms @xcite , we have been unable to match the experiment for the structure from fig .",
    "1 : the closest match obtained for current densities  even after allowing for very high electronic temperatures or artificially increased deformation potentials  is still several times higher than experiment .",
    "yet , we know that materials parameters are not the issue , because the calculations for the rtds on the same gaas / algaas system are quite accurate @xcite .    in this paper , we abandon the semiclassical rates based on fermi s golden rule and instead present a simple model collision operator comprising three terms , each with a solid intuitive foundation and no requirement for an @xmath72 vs @xmath34 relationship .",
    "all three are necessary in order to match the measured current - field characteristics , which is indicative of the interactions that the electrons undergo in superlattices at relatively low temperatures .",
    "( we note that a more rigorous form of the collision operator could , for example , be derived based on a markovian master equation for the single - particle density matrix @xcite and performing the wigner - weyl transform to obtain the wte ; thereby , the lindblad dissipative term from the master equation would yield the collision operator in wte . )",
    "the model collision integral we introduce here is given by    [ eq : collision integral ] @xmath73 = & - & \\frac{f(z , k , t)-f_\\mathrm{eq}(z , k)}{\\tau_r}\\label{eq : dissip}\\\\ & -&\\frac{f(z , k , t)-f(z ,- k , t)}{\\tau_m}\\label{eq : mom relax}\\\\    & + & \\lambda \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial k^2 } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : local}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as pointed out earlier , the time evolution induced by the collision integral is included in the time evolution of particle affinities according to eq .  .",
    "the second order @xmath34-derivative is evaluated using a second - order centered finite - difference scheme .      the first term , , has the form of the relaxation - time approximation collision integral in semiclassical transport .",
    "this term describes relaxation towards equilibrium with a relaxation time @xmath74 .",
    "this term dissipates energy and also partially randomizes momentum . even in semiclassical transport",
    ", this term technically holds only in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "it turns out that superlattices have a particular feature that make this approximation  relaxation to equilibrium as opposed to an _ a priori _ unknown steady state ",
    "applicable up to high current densities .",
    "figure  [ fig : popinversion ] shows the wfs for a few relevant subbands ( upper lasing , lower lasing , and injector states from fig .",

    "the spread over @xmath34 is of order inverse well width and is considerably greater than the drift wave vector ( the approximate shift of the state wfs along the @xmath34-axis ) up to very high current densities .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of forming an approximate collision integral , the nonequilibrium steady - state wigner function in superlattice can be approximated by the equilibrium form even under appreciable current .    ) .",
    "see figure [ fig : bandstructure ] for the spatial profile of the corresponding wave functions.,width=316 ]    to calculate the equilibrium wigner function @xmath79 , we first calculate the equilibrium density matrix . after the weyl - wigner transformation in the parallel @xmath80 variables and integration over parallel wave vector @xmath81 ,",
    "the equilibrium density matrix @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a normalization factor and @xmath85 are the envelope bloch wave functions obtained from a solution of the time - independent schrdinger equation for the considered periodic potential .",
    "the fermi level @xmath86 is determined from @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the electron density averaged over a period and @xmath89 is the density of states for the superlattice .",
    "the equilibrium wf is then calculated using eq .  .",
    "in general , momentum and energy relax at different rates , and the discrepancy is accommodated by an explicit term that randomizes momentum at a rate of @xmath90 , but does not dissipate energy .",
    "this term would be very important in the presence of nearly elastic mechanisms , especially if they are efficient at randomizing momentum , such as in the case of acoustic phonons that should be accounted for down to a few kelvin . without this term",
    ", current density can be orders of magnitude higher than experimental results , regardless of the choice of the relaxation time @xmath74 .",
    "this term also preserves the positivity of the density matrix .      the third term in eq .",
    "describes the decay of the spatial coherences of the density matrix , namely , @xmath91 this term describes the decay of the off - diagonal terms in the density matrix , i.e. , spatial decoherence @xcite , while preserving the positive - definiteness of the density matrix  @xcite . as a result of the action of this term ,",
    "the density matrix becomes increasingly diagonal over time and we can speak of well - defined position .",
    "therefore , we will use the terms spatial decoherence and localization of the density matrix inerchangaby ; @xmath92 has previously been referred to as the localization rate @xcite , and we adopt the term here as well , even though it is technically a misnomer ( @xmath92 has the units of inverse length squared and time , rather than the units of inverse time , which a quantity called rate generally has ) . in the wigner function formalism , coherence over large spatial distances corresponds with fast oscillations of the wf in the @xmath34-direction  @xcite .",
    "the localization term depicts diffusion in phase space and tends to smooth out the wf . in simple cases , it is possible to calculate the localization rate @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "here , we will treat it as a phenomenological parameter that is determined based on comparison with experiment .",
    "there is an additonal , fairly subtle reason why this form is particularly well suited for the description of spatial decoherence in nanostructures that carry current .",
    "namely , nanostructures that carry current are open systems with densely spaced energy levels and generally strong coupling with the contacts @xcite . within the framework of the open systems theory @xcite ,",
    "this limit  smaller energy spacing ( per @xmath0 ) than the typical relaxation rate of the system  corresponds to the brownian motion limit .",
    "the spatial decoherence term has indeed been used to study quantum brownian motion  @xcite due to coupling of an open system with an ohmic bosonic bath by caldeira and legget  @xcite .",
