    "overcoming critical slowing down in monte carlo simulations of lattice field theories is imperative to approach the continuum limit .",
    "collective mode algorithms have improved the quality of numerical studies for systems with bosonic degrees of freedom substantially during the last years . besides many other things the important role played by autocorrelation functions has been recognized and in particular strong finite size effects present in the decay of autocorrelation functions have been observed .    on the other hand it is fair to say , that the improvements of fermionic simulation algorithms for lattice field theories since the introduction of the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm @xcite ten years ago have not been overwhelming .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the hmc algorithm has been possible in the free field case @xcite while the practical analysis to compare the performance of variants of the hmc algorithm and other dynamical fermion algorithms for lattice qcd has only be done for wilson fermions @xcite .    the work reported here is a first step to obtain reliable estimates for integrated autocorrelation times of different operators in lattice qcd with dynamical staggered fermions using two different simulation algorithms .",
    "in lattice quantum field theory one evaluates expectation values of observables @xmath0 @xmath1 with @xmath2 the action and @xmath3 a field on a lattice @xmath4 by a dynamic monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the _ dynamics _ of the numerical algorithm is a stochastic process which is realized on a computer by a markov process .",
    "the transition probability matrix @xmath5 leaves the equilibrium distribution invariant .    _",
    "detailed balance _ is equivalent to the selfadjointness of @xmath6 as an operator on @xmath7 with real spectrum @xmath8 , and the stationarity condition @xmath9 may be read as an eigenvalue equation with eigenvalue @xmath10 and eigenvector @xmath11 .",
    "all other eigenvalues @xmath12 have the upper bound 1 .    the exponential autocorrelation time @xmath13 parameterizes the gap between @xmath14 and the subleading ( unwanted ) modes .",
    "the _ expected error _",
    "@xmath15 of an observable @xmath0 is @xmath16 with the autocorrelation function @xmath17 and the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath18    the performance of dynamic monte carlo algorithms for a finite system with linear size @xmath19 and correlation length @xmath20 is described by _ empirical dynamical scaling laws",
    "introduce a set of `` fictitious momenta '' @xmath22 and a hamiltonian @xmath23 then the hmc alternates two markov steps : _ momentum refreshment _ and _ monte carlo molecular dynamics _ which contains molecular dynamics and a global metropolis step to correct for the discretization errors in hamilton s equations .    the first step is momentum refreshment , where momenta @xmath22 are replaced by new values chosen at random from a gaussian distribution .",
    "horowitz @xcite suggested a generalized momentum refreshment ( kramers equation ) by adding a gaussian noise @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    "one obtains full momentum refreshment , while @xmath28 gives exact generalization of the second order langevin algorithm .",
    "detailed balance will be satisfied if the new phase space configuration is accepted with probability @xmath29=      \\min ( 1 , e^{h(\\phi,\\pi ) - h(\\phi',\\pi')}).\\ ] ]",
    "all our results are for lattice qcd with four flavours of dynamical staggered fermions and gauge group @xmath30 .    in the hmc algorithm",
    "there are two free parameters : the integration step size @xmath31 and the trajectory length @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of integration steps .",
    "@xmath31 must be adjusted to keep @xmath34 reasonably large .",
    "optimal choice for @xmath35 is less clear . in the _ gaussian model _ with @xmath36 the dynamical critical exponent @xmath37 is @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and @xmath40 if @xmath41 . for constant @xmath35",
    "the dynamical critical exponent @xmath37 becomes @xmath38 for @xmath42 .    for dynamical fermions with @xmath43 we measured autocorrelation times for the plaquette , polyakov loop , and the chiral order parameter with trajectory length @xmath44 on various lattices with sample sizes of  @xmath45 .    in fig",
    "1 we show the autocorrelation function of the plaquette on a lattice of size @xmath46 for both algorithms . for the kramers equation algorithm @xmath47 ( see below ) and on the horizontal axis @xmath48 is given in units of molecular dynamics time .",
    "the straight lines are fixed exponentials to guide the eye .    for the kramers equation",
    "algorithms the second exponential in the decay of the autocorrelation function seemed to be stronger coupled .",
    "this observation has been found for local as well as nonlocal observables .      through the generalized momentum refreshment",
    "a new tunable parameter @xmath49 is introduced .",
    "detailed balance requires that the momenta must have their sign flipped after every rejected step .",
    "the monte carlo molecular dynamics step can be performed @xmath50 times . for dynamical fermions with @xmath43 we measure autocorrelation times @xmath51 for the plaquette , polyakov loop and the chiral order parameter with @xmath52 , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we compare the cost in molecular dynamics time for the polyakov loop operator as a function of stepsize for both algorithms .",
    "data with @xmath55 and @xmath56 are included and compared with hmc using a trajectory length @xmath57 .",
    "we consider the pattern of this plot similar to the findings of @xcite in their figure 2 .",
    "the computational demands of our study let us move to the massively parallel processing cray t3d with a peak rate of 150 mflops in 64 bit arithmetic per node .",
    "we decided to implement the shared memory routines because they show less overhead than parallel virtuell machine or message passing interface .",
    "we found the expected speedup within a few percents for 4 pes up to 128 pes on a @xmath58 lattice .",
    "for our present implementation of the hmc algorithm 5 pes on a t3d are equivalent to one ymp processor indicating the improvment of the performance to cost ratio @xcite .",
    "we find that reasonable high statistics are absolutely necessary to obtain reliable error bars for the integrated autocorrelation times .",
    "we consider the different decay behaviour of the integrated autocorrelation functions for the observables studied so far as an indication for different efficiency . up to",
    "now we did not find a competitive set of parameters for the kramers equation algorithm .",
