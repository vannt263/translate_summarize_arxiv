    "the cdm model of structure formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) postulates that galaxies form when initial perturbations in a sea of cold ( non - relativistic ) dark matter particles seed the growth of larger dark matter haloes characterised by a central density cusp @xmath3 , where @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , the rotation curves of massive galaxies almost invariably suggest that haloes have a flat density core rather than a sharp cusp ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it has been suggested that an initial cusp may be destroyed by feedback mechanisms that couple supernovae driven winds to the dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but models of this sort have had mixed success .    the dsph galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surrounding the milky way provide a good laboratory in which to test cdm predictions on small scales : most are sufficiently nearby to allow us to measure the velocities of hundreds of member stars , and most have such meagre baryonic content that their internal dynamics is everywhere dominated by the dark matter .",
    "although it has argued for some time that cdm greatly overpredicts the number of dwarfs , some recent work @xcite suggests that cdm is actually in good agreement with the local dsph population .",
    "ursa minor is , with draco , one of the two most dark matter dominated dsphs of the local group , with a central mass to light ratio @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "umi s stars appear to have been formed in a single burst @xcite , and its size , stellar velocity dispersion , and luminosity resemble those of draco , which has been shown to have a _",
    "mean _ mass to light ratio @xmath7 within three core radiii @xcite .",
    "unlike most other dsphs , however , umi has substantial morphological distortions : umi is highly elongated , and appears to possess a secondary clump or shoulder on the northeast side of the major axis @xcite .",
    "it is often argued that this clump can not be a persistent feature because the @xmath8 year stellar crossing time of the system is orders of magnitude shorter than its @xmath9 year age , so that stellar orbits within an unbound clump will diverge over hundreds of dsph crossings .",
    "umi s relatively circular orbit @xcite weighs against the common explanation that the clump is a temporary artefact generated through ongoing tidal disruption by the galaxy .",
    "generally , models that attempt to explain the dsphs large velocity dispersions by tidal disruption still require dark matter , or else must postulate an unseen supply of dsphs to replace those that are disrupted @xcite , or require that dsphs are disintegrated remnants viewed along a very fortuitous line of sight @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use a data set consisting of new and extant umi stellar velocities to argue that the second peak in umi s stellar distribution has a cold kinematical signature , and we demonstrate that a plausible explanation is that the clump is a disrupted stellar cluster sloshing back and forth within umi s halo .",
    "we use numerical simulations and analytical arguments to show that persistent substructure is consistent with a cored halo , but not with a cusped cdm halo .",
    "in may 2002 , we obtained spectra of 63 stars in umi using the wyffos multifibre spectrograph at the william herschel telescope on la palma .",
    "we cross - correlated the spectra with a synthetic template of the ca triplet lines at @xmath10 nm to measure velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the median velocity error was 5 @xmath11 , less than the umi s 8.8 @xmath11 central velocity dispersion .",
    "as our stars were mostly at large projected radii in umi , we combined our data with the more centrally concentrated sample of armandroff et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , after subtracting the mean velocity difference of the two data sets .",
    "the combined data set contains 134 stars . because the observing run was curtailed by bad weather , the data did not extend to a sufficiently large radius to allow a fit to the halo shape and anisotropy ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we noted that a histogram of stellar velocities near the clump on the northeast side of umi s major axis appeared narrower than the @xmath12 gaussian describing umi s overall line of sight velocity distribution ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this observation suggested constructing a model of umi s population consisting of the sum of two gaussians , one representing the underlying @xmath13 gaussian , and the other representing a sub - population of unknown fraction @xmath14 , velocity offset @xmath15 , and velocity dispersion @xmath16 . assuming an observational velocity uncertainty @xmath17 , the probability of observing a particular velocity in this model is    @xmath18 }   \\over \\sqrt{2\\pi ( { \\sigma_s}^2 + \\sigma_{\\rm obs}^2 ) }   } \\,\\ , + \\\\ & & ( 1-f)\\times   { \\exp { \\left[-{1\\over 2 } { v^2\\over \\sigma_0 ^ 2 + \\sigma_{\\rm obs}^2 }   \\right ] }   \\over \\sqrt{2\\pi ( \\sigma_0 ^ 2 + \\sigma_{\\rm obs}^2 ) }   } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the likelihood of obtaining a ensemble of velocities @xmath19 with errors @xmath20 is @xmath21 next we scanned the face of umi in ra and dec in @xmath22 increments . at each point , we collected all velocities in a @xmath23 radius aperture , and computed the statistical likelihood of drawing these velocities from an 8.8 @xmath11 gaussian ( equation 2 with @xmath24 ) , as well as the likelihood of drawing the velocities from each member of a grid of two - guassian models ( equation 2 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) . when the likelihood of the best - fitting two - gaussian model exceeded the likelihood of the single gaussian model by a large factor , we deemed that aperture to contain a kinematic subpopulation distinct from the rest of umi s stars .",
    "figure 2 shows the result of the scanning procedure .",
    "large dots are apertures where we found a significant ( likelihood ratio @xmath28 ) sub - population . at the largest dot , the best two - gaussian population",
    "( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) is @xmath32 times more likely than the default 8.8 @xmath33 single - gaussian model .",
    "moreover , the largest dot is very close to where the isopleth contours indicate the presence of a secondary peak in the stars .",
    "the small value of @xmath15 suggests that the sub - population is either on a radial orbit or a face - on circular orbit .",
    "we note that our best - fit @xmath16 is ill - determined because it is much smaller than the velocity measurement errors .",
    "also , this small value of @xmath16 applies only to the surviving phase space region of the progenitor cluster - any faster stars may have joined umi s general population .",
    "we verified the statistical significance of the second kinematical population with a monte - carlo test : we repeatedly generated artificial data drawn from an 8.8 k m / s gaussian at the same locations and with the same velocity uncertainties as our actual data , and subjected it to the scanning procedure described above .",
    "we found that only 11 of 2000 ( 0.055% ) artificial data sets give as large a likelihood ratio as the actual data anywhere in umi .",
    "only one of these false positives suggested an orbit in the plane of the sky , and all of the others had @xmath34 .",
    "to investigate the survival of a cold kinematical sub - population in a dsph , we integrated the motion of a group of unbound stars inside a plausible halo model .",
    "we assumed a halo density law @xmath35 , which has a core for @xmath36 and a @xmath37 cusp for @xmath38 .",
    "we dropped an unbound clump modelled as a three dimensional spatial gaussian with a three dimensional gaussian velocity dispersion into this halo , and followed its evolution with an adaptive stepsize runge - kutta code for 12 gyr . using the mass of draco as a reference @xcite , we normalised the enclosed mass of the model to @xmath39 inside @xmath40 , where @xmath40 corresponds to 600 pc , approximately the maximum extent of the stellar distribution . in our dimensionless units ,",
    "the clump orbits within @xmath41 , or 150 pc in physical units .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of the simulations .",
    "when a clump with an initial one dimensional dispersion @xmath42 and a one - sigma radius of 0.02 ( 12 pc ) is dropped at an initial radius @xmath43 into a halo with an @xmath44 core ( top panel ) on near - radial orbit with a tangential velocity equal to 0.07 times the circular speed at @xmath45 , the resulting sub - structure is visible for many gyr .",
    "even at 12 gyr , nearly the age of the universe , the remnants of the clump are spatially concentrated and asymmetrical .",
    "when an identical clump is dropped into a @xmath38 cusped halo ( bottom panel ) the clump dissipates completely within 1 gyr .",
    "the total velocity @xmath46 histograms of figure 3 demonstrate that the stars remain cold for much of the evolution of the cored model , whereas they quickly achieve a flat distribution in a cusp .",
    "however , the fact that the orbit is constructed to be approximately in the plane of the sky implies that the measured line - of - sight @xmath47 distribution remains cold for both the core and cusp .",
    "the distinguishing observable feature of the cored model , therefore , is a _",
    "localized _ population that is cold in the line - of - sight .",
    "further simulations demonstrate that this conclusion holds good both for more circular orbits and for triaxial haloes .",
    "cusps shallower than @xmath37 only slightly increase the longevity of the clump : for example , a clump in a @xmath48 cusp survives approximately twice as long as in a @xmath37 cusp .",
    "if the halo core is an order of magnitude larger than the clump s orbit , a clump can survive almost unalterned for a hubble time . if the core radius is equal to or smaller than the clump s orbit , however , the clump is destroyed within one or two gyr .",
    "we conclude that a clump can survive for a large fraction of a hubble time only if it is embedded in a core at least two or three times the size of its orbit .",
    "an additional concern is the possibility that galactic tides may destroy substructure in a cored halo . to address this point , we added the effect of tides to our simulation .",
    "we modelled the galaxy as an isothermal sphere of mass @xmath49 inside 50 kpc , somewhat more massive than the value of @xcite ; at a 60 kpc apogalacticon , the tidal force from this galaxy model is 0.02 times as strong as the dwarf s gravity at a unitless dsph radius @xmath40 .",
    "we then created a varying tidal force in the dwarf s @xmath50 plane by moving the isothermal galaxy model around the dsph on 1.6 gyr orbits with eccentricities between 0 and 0.5 . in no instance did this weak tidal force significantly affect the survival of substructure either in a core or in a cusp .",
    "indeed , we could safely make the tidal force an order of magnitude larger without causing the clump to disintegrate in the above @xmath44 core .",
    "we emphasize that these simulations are not in any sense a fit to the umi data .",
    "rather , they demonstrate that substructure can easily persist for many gyr in a plausible cored halo , but is quickly erased in a cusp .",
    "several unconstrained parameters affect the survival of substructure in a core .",
    "in addition to increasing the core size , for example , one can decrease the dsph s mass , slowing the internal time scale and decreasing the number of orbits over which a clump can dissipate .",
    "similarly , one can increase the longevity of the clump by decreasing its initial size or velocity dispersion .",
    "we find that strong substructure continues to persist for 12 gyr when we double or treble the size or dispersion of our model clump in figure 3 , although the final distribution is less compact than in our illustrative example .",
    "we note that there is a simple explanation for the persistence of a clump in any cored halo : a generic feature of dark matter haloes with cores is that the potential is close to that of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the one dimensional @xmath51 motion of a particle with position @xmath52 and velocity @xmath53 at time @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "then the @xmath51 distance between two particles dropped into a harmonic potential at positions and @xmath56 with velocities @xmath57 is given for all time as @xmath58    the cosine term is bounded by the initial separation , and the sine term is bounded by the orbital amplitude times the ratio of the relative speed ( dispersion ) to the orbital speed , in the approximation that the dispersion is smaller than the orbital speed .",
    "because the three dimensions of the harmonic oscillator are independent , this result does not depend on spherical symmetry and is valid for any triaxial harmonic potential .",
    "hence , if the non - harmonic terms of the taylor expansion of the potential are sufficiently small , an unbound stellar clump with a small but finite internal dispersion can persist over a long time , pulsating in size without disintegrating .    in view of the above discussion",
    ", the fact that the tidal force only weakly affects clump survival is not surprising .",
    "the lowest order term of the tidal force arises from a rotating quadratic effective potential .",
    "this quadratic potential changes adiabatically , because the dwarf s orbit around the galaxy is @xmath59 times longer than the internal time scale .",
    "thus particles on adjacent sinusoidal orbits remain on adjacent sinusoidal orbits as the potential evolves .",
    "the low - dispersion substructure that we observe in umi is consistent with a clump progenitor similar to star clusters seen elsewhere in the local group . by rescaling the number of stars in the best aperture by the best - fit subpopulation fraction @xmath31",
    ", we estimate that the clump contains @xmath60 of umi s population .",
    "if we assume that umi has a normal stellar mass to light ratio @xmath61 and a total v - band luminosity @xmath62 , the clump has a luminosity of @xmath63 @xmath64 and a mass @xmath65 .",
    "these parameters are similar to the low mass globular clusters in the smc and lmc .",
    "a cluster with the mass of our clump and a half - mass radius @xmath66 has a characteristic one - dimensional internal velocity @xmath67 , cold compared to umi s overall population .",
    "such low - mass clusters can become unbound immediately after formation when supernovae expel the gas content @xcite , or possibly slowly though tidal interactions with the parent galaxy s halo @xcite .",
    "ursa minor is known to possess a second peak in its stellar distribution .",
    "we demonstrate that the stars in the vicinity of this peak comprise a kinematically distinct cold sub - population ; the probability of obtaining a similarly strong false positive in the absence of a sub - population is @xmath68 .",
    "we show that the properties of this clump are consistent with the remnants of a disrupted stellar cluster orbiting in the plane of the sky within the harmonic potential of cored dark matter halo .",
    "although a clump can persist for a hubble time in a harmonic potential , the potential of a cdm cusped halo would destroy the clump within @xmath69 gyr .",
    "this finding suggests that the haloes of even the least massive , most dark matter dominated galaxies possess a core rather than a cusp .",
