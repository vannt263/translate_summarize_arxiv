    "the square lattice quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( slqha ) with spin @xmath0 is one of the paradigmatic models in condensed matter physics and has been extensively investigated in the last two decades , mainly in connection with the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite good agreement with experimental data is obtained from the analysis of an effective continuous field theory , rigorously justified in the limit of large spin @xmath2 , given by the @xmath3-dimensional nonlinear @xmath4 model ( nl@xmath4m).@xcite the coupling @xmath5 in the nl@xmath4 m controls the transition between nel - ordered and quantum disordered phases and it can be shown that the slqha maps to the renormalized classical regime of the nl@xmath4 m ( @xmath6 ) , which therefore has a long - range ordered ground - state .",
    "@xcite    the proximity to a quantum critical point may , however , lead to a crossover to a finite temperature quantum critical regime where thermodynamic quantities are affected by strong quantum fluctuations and display universal behavior.@xcite nevertheless , numerical simulations@xcite indicate that this crossover may be too narrow to be detectable , possibly due to the fact that the slqha is deep inside the renormalized classical regime .",
    "this difficulty has motivated the investigation of antiferromagnets defined on _ decorated _ square lattices where the proximity to a quantum critical point separating singlet - disordered and nel - ordered phases is controlled by adjusting couplings in the hamiltonian.@xcite     ( @xmath7 ) , represented by thick ( thin ) continuous lines [ see eq .",

( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ] by capponi _ et al._.@xcite we extend their results by deriving a longer - ranged core expansion",
    ". we also notice that our core expansion is essentially a strong coupling ( on - site repulsion @xmath56 ) version of the one derived in ref .  , where an effective hamiltonian for the hubbard model on the square lattice was obtained , but we have the advantages of a more natural motivation for choosing the plaquettes as elementary blocks and of the absence of charge degrees of freedom .",
    "we start by noticing that the original spin model described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is particularly amenable to a core analysis , for the strongly coupled plaquettes are a natural choice as the elementary blocks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] ; for details on the core procedure the reader is referred to refs .   and ) .",
    "the retained low - lying block states are the plaquette s singlet ground - state @xmath57 and the triplet states @xmath58 , with @xmath59 denoting the total @xmath60 component .",
    "this choice for the restricted local basis is justified by the fact that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the lowest block s eigenstates and also , as shown by capponi _",
    "et al._,@xcite by their large weight in the density matrix of a plaquette embedded in a larger cluster .",
    "effective couplings between these retained block states are obtained by subsequently diagonalizing a cluster comprised of connected plaquettes : a matching number of cluster s low - lying eigenstates are projected upon the basis formed by the tensor products of local singlets and triplets , an effective hamiltonian being obtained by imposing the constraint that the cluster s low - energy spectrum is exactly reproduced and by subtracting interactions previously obtained from clusters involving lesser plaquettes .",
    "we employ the clusters highlighted in fig .",

    "the effective model resulting from the above procedure is expected to evidence dominant microscopic mechanisms at play in the original model and physically sound results are ideally obtained by means of a simplified subsequent analysis .",
    "we stress that our approach differs from the previous one @xcite in a crucial way : while capponi _",
    "et al._@xcite restricted their core expansion to the shortest - range and studied the resulting range-1 effective hamiltonian by means of exact diagonalizations , we expect that good results are obtainable in a simpler way from an extended core expansion including longer - ranged interactions .",
    "accordingly , we locate the quantum critical point by determining the value of @xmath18 where the gap for triplet excitations ( @xmath61 ) vanishes and estimate @xmath61 from the effective core hamiltonian simply as @xmath62 @xmath63 is the chemical potential for triplet excitations above the singlet ground - state for low @xmath18 and the second term accounts for the triplons kinetic energy : @xmath64 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) , @xmath65 the next - nn and @xmath66 the third - nn hopping amplitudes.@xcite in other words , eq .",

    "fig : core ] , compared with the ones obtained from the plaquette series expansion derived in ref .",
    ".@xcite as expected , all results mutually agree in the limit of small @xmath18 , where they are essentially exact ; for larger @xmath18 , range-@xmath9 and -2 core underestimate @xmath61 . however , the values of @xmath18 where range-@xmath9 and -2 results for @xmath61 vanish are in surprisingly good agreement with the qmc results for @xmath20 presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmc ] : @xmath68 for range-@xmath9 and @xmath69 for range-2 .",
    "these values are seemingly converging very fast to a result consistent with the qmc estimates and this suggests that the procedure employed here might lead to more precise estimates for the critical point than the one employed in refs .   and , where @xmath70 was obtained .",
    "we conjecture that this unexpected accuracy is related to level - crossings observed close to the point where @xmath61 vanishes .",
    "however , obviously we can not discard the possibility that this remarkable agreement is coincidental and remark that poorer results are obtained for intermediate values of @xmath18 , with the consequence that @xmath61 from core does not follow a power law ( as seen from a logarithmic plot , not shown ) .",
    "however , it is desirable to further test the procedure employed here by considering similar spin models.@xcite",
    "summarizing , we have investigated an @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a  plaquettized \" square lattice ( fig .  [ fig : lattice ] ) by means of qmc and core .",
