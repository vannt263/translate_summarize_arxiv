    "this problem , @xcite ( hereafter denoted as paper i ) devised a monte - carlo method to estimate stellar metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) which appears particularly good at both metal - rich and metal - poor ends .",

    ", the ratio has the maximum value of 1.536 when comparing with others .",
    "this panel corresponds to the fainter and bluer stars that are reasonably belong to the galactic halo .",
    "the central idea for converting sdss @xmath0 to scuss @xmath0 is that we obtain the color distribution of converted @xmath7 according to the inputting distribution of @xmath34 and the scatter diagram in each panel of figure [ color_scatter ] .",
    "the scatter diagram of @xmath35 versus @xmath34 is now explained as the consequence of probability .",
    "more points in a small region imply that a star have higher probability to locate in it .",
    "we reproduce a given distribution by the monte - carlo method .",
    "the converted @xmath7 should be considered as same as @xmath35 . here , in order to distinguish the converted @xmath7 from original @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we denoted converted @xmath7 with a subscript , namely @xmath43 .    for @xmath44 stars corresponding to @xmath45 , @xmath46 , we generate @xmath44 random numbers according to the distribution exhibited by the 15 numbers from @xmath47[b][0]$ ] to @xmath47[b][15]$ ] .",

    "it is explained as follows .",
    "suppose that there are two stochastic variables , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which can be assigned a random number generating function @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "in each trial , we obtain a random number pair ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , where @xmath49 is modulated to take the uniform - probability distributed random real number from 0 to 15 . for any star , whose @xmath27 and @xmath12 has determined , @xmath50 is modulated to take the uniform - probability distributed random real number from 0 to @xmath36[i]$ ] .",
    "when @xmath53[i][int(x)]$ ] ( @xmath54 , the integer portion of @xmath49 ) , we record @xmath49 as a useful value , and otherwise discard it . by numerous trials ,",
    "we obtain a sequence of random numbers @xmath55 that follow the same probability distribution as those recorded in @xmath30[i][:]$ ] . here , because @xmath30[i][j]$ ] can be equal to zero for some @xmath32 values , we can discard them and record the non - zero elements and their positions in a new array . through this method ,",
    "the sampling efficiency can be improved greatly .",
    "versus @xmath34 .",
    "main - sequence stars with @xmath1 and @xmath56 are selected .",
    "the data are fitted with a linear line , with the expression shown in the figure .",
    "the slope almost equal to 1 . ]    from the top three two - color diagrams of figure [ color_scatter ] , we find that @xmath34 may be expressed as a linear function of @xmath35 .",
    "for the selected stars with @xmath37 , the error of @xmath0 plays the minor role for the distribution of points in these diagrams . if the @xmath0-band ( both sdss and scuss ) magnitudes were absolutely precise , the resulting transformation relation is supposed as follows :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the slope and @xmath59 represents a constant .    in evaluating",
    "which color ( either @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) has greater error , the reliability of the standard deviation ratio shown in figure [ color_scatter ] depends on the assumption of @xmath60 . in figure [ color_scatter_fitting ]",
    ", we plot a two - color diagram of @xmath35 versus @xmath34 for main - sequence stars with @xmath1 and @xmath56 .",
    "we also notice that the error of @xmath0-band magnitude at the bright magnitude @xmath61 is small , and therefore its effect on the color distribution in figure [ color_scatter_fitting ] can be neglected .",
    "the trend of @xmath34 versus @xmath35 is fitted by a line , with the expression shown in the figure .",
    "the slope @xmath62 is almost equal to 1 .",
    "the assumption of @xmath60 holds on . we can evaluate which @xmath0 has greater error by dispersion degree of points in figure [ color_scatter ] .",
    "in addition , for convenience we may also approximately assume that sdss @xmath0 and scuss @xmath0 are from the same photometric system , since they are almost similar if neglecting the error , as shown in figure [ color_scatter_fitting ] .        in order to evaluate the effect of this conversion",
    ", we plot the histograms of distribution of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath43 for main - sequence stars with different magnitude and color ranges in figure [ color_histogram ] .",
    "the top three panels show color distribution of stars with @xmath63 , the middle three with @xmath64 , and the bottom three with @xmath65 . corresponding with the color range , stars for panels from left column to right column are with @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the histograms in each panel are normalized to the maximum , with the actual peak values labeled .",
    "it is clear that the profiles of the histograms of @xmath43 in each panel are almost same as those of @xmath35 .",
    "this effect indicates that the conversion has the ability to make the error of @xmath66 smaller , as small as that of @xmath67 .",
    "actually , the distribution of @xmath43 will completely coincide with that of @xmath35 as long as the number of stars selected is large enough for the histogram .",
    "after all the convertor arrays are constructed by the data of scuss @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for larger sky area in which there have no scuss @xmath0 , the convertor array could be used to make the error of sdss @xmath0 smaller . as a result , the error of the converted @xmath0 magnitude when @xmath4 is equal to the original error of sdss @xmath0 when @xmath3 .",
    "however , we are still cautious that to what extent this conversion method can diminish the @xmath0 magnitude error can not be fully tested until a deeper survey is available .",
    "as we all know , @xmath0-band measurements is very important to derive the photometric metallicity and therefore to construct a precise mdf .",
    "because of the relatively shallow survey limit ( @xmath68 ) and the relatively large error in the sdss @xmath0-band near the faint end , the application of the photometric metallicity estimates is greatly restricted in the range of @xmath16 , an insufficient depth to explore the distant halo and substructures . however , the scuss @xmath0 is 1.5 mag deeper than sdss @xmath0 , and its error is smaller than sdss @xmath0 error on the whole .",
    "the potential application of the conversion from sdss @xmath0 to scuss @xmath0 is very important to derive relative accurate photometric metallicities of distant stars . in paper",
    "i , we developed a new method to estimate the photometric metallicity distribution of large number of stars .",
    "compared with other photometric calibration methods , this method in paper i effectively reduces the error induced by the method itself , and therefore enables a more reliable determination of the photometric mdf .",
    "however , another error source still matters : the error of sdss @xmath0-band magnitude .",
    "this error behavior limits the application of the method in the range of @xmath16 in paper i. this range is same as that of ivezi et al.s ( 2008 ) photometric metallicity estimator .",
    "the more accurate scuss @xmath0-band measurements guarantee the accuracy of the stellar distribution in @xmath7 versus @xmath8 panel , and it extends the application of method in paper i to even fainter stars . thus",
    ", the photometric mdf of distant stars such as halo stars or some stream stars can be estimated .    however , only the stars in south galactic cap are surveyed by scuss which have relatively more accurate @xmath0 band magnitude , how to derive the photometric metallicity of stars in the north galactic hemisphere ?",
    "the conversion from sdss @xmath0 to scuss @xmath0 statistically diminish the error of @xmath0-band magnitude , which make it possible to estimate the photometric mdf of stars in the whole sky . in this study",
    ", we have done the conversion for stars in @xmath5 .",
    "the conversion combined with the method introduced in paper i enable us to estimate the photometric metallicity distribution function for stars at least in the range of @xmath17 , which is 1 mag deeper than that of spectroscopically - surveyed stars .",
    "so we can study the chemical structure of the galactic halo more detailed . besides the application described above , the more accurate @xmath0 band magnitude from the conversion ,",
