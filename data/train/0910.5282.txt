    "during and just after the epoch of planet formation , a significant number of planetesimals were left that had not accreted into planets .",
    "some of the planetesimals near the giant planets were ejected to orbits with large semi - major axes , and many more were hurled hyperbolically into interstellar space . those objects which formed beyond proto - neptune",
    "would probably remain near the ecliptic plane and became part of the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "up to the present , more than 1000  kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) have been discovered .",
    "the estimated total mass of the kuiper belt from observations to date is @xmath1m@xmath2 , which is a few orders of magnitude less than the mass predicted for the minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "theoretical simulations show that in order to assemble 1000-km size objects between 30 and 50  au , initially there must have been much more mass in this region @xcite than the current observations suggest .",
    "many surveys indicate a kuiper belt `` cliff '' beyond 50  au @xcite . given that more than 99% of the original disk mass appears to have been depleted , some sort of dynamical perturbations must have removed objects from this region .    furthermore , the origin of @xmath3vb@xmath4 ( sedna , with orbital parameters of @xmath5=531  au , @xmath6=76  au , @xmath7 ) is puzzling @xcite .",
    "searches for thermal radiation from sedna with the iram 30  m telescope and spitzer have put an upper limit on its diameter of @xmath8 km @xcite .",
    "the mass of sedna , from the upper limit on the size and mean density of kbos , is estimated to be @xmath9m@xmath2 . given its large size and highly eccentric orbit , in situ formation seems unlikely .",
    "sedna is unique because its perihelion at 76  au is far outside the reach of dynamical perturbation by neptune , and the aphelion of @xmath101000  au is also too small for sedna to be affected sufficiently by giant molecular clouds or galactic tides in the solar neighborhood .",
    "meanwhile , recent observations have shown that sedna is likely to have methane , water and nitrogen ices .",
    "the similarity of the spectroscopic features between sedna and triton suggests its formation near the giant planet region .",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain the existence of sedna in its present orbit .",
    "for instance , a close stellar encounter @xcite could have depleted the kuiper belt and excited outer solar system objects , such as sedna , to their present orbits .",
    "other possibilities have also been suggested , including rogue mars - sized bodies , or multiple stellar encounters in the sun s birth cluster @xcite .",
    "note that all of these theories also predict that many more objects would be found in _ sedna - like _ orbits , i.e. orbits with perihelia large enough to be unaffected by neptune and aphelia small enough to be unaffected by galactic tidal forces or giant molecular clouds .",
    "furthermore , the fact that sedna was discovered very close to perihelion , where it spends a very small fraction of its orbital period , led @xcite to infer that there may be as much as many as 500 objects in similar orbits with the same size as sedna or larger . however , recent search attempts @xcite did not find any new member of this population .",
    "in their recent survey , @xcite modeled objects with the same semi - major axis and eccentricity as sedna .",
    "a best fit of 40 objects brighter than or equal to sedna in that region is consistent with their results of detecting one object with a perihelion past 70  au .",
    "most objects in sedna - like orbits would have escaped from direct detection due to their enormous distances from the earth .",
    "direct detection of this kind of object is limited to relatively close objects and by large telescopes , so the majority of the population is still well beyond the detection limit for most ground - based telescopes .",
    "@xcite suggested that the existence of the `` invisible '' objects in this region might be inferred by stellar occultation , and the utility of using robotic telescopes to search for occultations by outer solar system objects has been demonstrated @xcite .    the taiwanese - american occultation survey ( taos ) aims to investigate the size distribution of small ( @xmath101  km ) kbos @xcite .",
    "four 50  cm robotic telescopes have been installed at lulin mountain in central taiwan .",
    "each telescope is a fast f/2 system with a 3 deg@xmath11 field of view , equipped with a 2k@xmath122k ccd camera that can perform 5  hz photometric sampling on a few hundred stars simultaneously .",
    "multiple telescopes are used to reduce the false positive event rate .",
    "the taos system has been in routine operation with three telescopes since february 2005 , and four - telescope observations began in august 2008 .",
    "taos was designed to search for kbos near 50  au , for which a typical occultation by a kbo of a few km across would manifest itself as a flux reduction in only one or two consecutive time series measurements . with a null detection , a stringent constraint has been set on the number and size distribution of kbos by @xcite .",
    "however , the same data set can be used to detect objects in the distant solar system all the way to @xmath101000  au ; i.e. , the survey is also sensitive to objects in sedna - like orbits . for objects at 100  1000  au , the fresnel scale and the projected size of the background star are larger than for objects in the kuiper belt , resulting in occultation events with longer durations @xcite .",
    "thus a distant occultation event would have flux reductions spanning _ several _ lightcurve points and requires a different analysis pipeline on the taos data from that reported in @xcite . here",
    "we present our analysis of the taos data to search for objects on sedna - like orbits .",
    "an estimate of the number of such objects detected would help constrain the population of bodies beyond 50  au , thereby confronting theoretical models of the early solar system , and address the puzzle of mass deficit in the region .",
    "stellar occultations by solar system objects fall into the domain of fresnel diffraction @xcite if the object diameter @xmath13 , the _ fresnel scale _ , which is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the observing wavelength and @xmath16 is the distance from the object to the observer . for the taos system , where @xmath17  nm , this corresponds to objects with @xmath18  km at 100  au or @xmath19  km at 1000  au .",
    "a high cadence system like taos will translate diffraction profile into several time - sampled lightcurve points every second as the shadow of a stellar occultation sweeps across a telescope .    shows examples of diffraction profile for a 10  km diameter object occulting a 0.01  milli - arcsecond ( mas ) background star ( v=11 a0v star ) at 200 and 1000  au , with a zero impact parameter ( defined as the line - of - sight distance between the centers of object and background star ) .",
    "note that we integrated every 0.2  sec with a random starting time to simulate the 5  hz sampling of the taos observations . in order to find possible events in the taos lightcurves ,",
    "our task is to detect such shallow flux reductions in consecutive lightcurve points .    to detect occultation events by objects in sedna - like orbits ,",
    "we have applied an algorithm to identify consecutive , relatively shallow flux drops .",
    "the key is to recognize systematic , weak flux reduction with an unknown duration . for each point in the lightcurve , we defined two windows consisting of a set of consecutive photometric measurements centered on that point .",
    "first , a window ( _ background _ window ) of a certain size is selected , in which the median value serves as the local nominal flux level .",
    "then , at the center of the background window , a smaller window ( _ signal _ window ) is chosen that is relevant to the size and distance of the objects we want to search for ( see ) .",
    "the sum of deviations of all data values from the local nominal value within the signal window then is a measure of systematic brightening or dimming in the lightcurves .",
    "a large cumulative deviation occurring simultaneously in multiple telescopes suggests the possibility of an occultation event within the signal window .",
    "the concept is similar to the equivalent width ( ew ) in spectroscopy for the strength of a spectral line relative to local continua and is similar to what @xcite used in their work .",
    "we define the ew index as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the median value from all the measurements within the background window , and @xmath22 is the flux of the @xmath23 lightcurve point within the signal window @xmath24 centered at @xmath25 .",
    "the ew algorithm works because flux reductions of consecutive lightcurve points , albeit weak , accumulate to result in a small ew index . to search for events",
    ", these windows were centered at each point in the lightcurve set , except the beginning and end of a lightcurve set where we can not define a complete background window , and the corresponding @xmath26 value was calculated .",
    "the size of the signal window is determined by the occultation event width and the relative velocity between the observer and the object .",
    "the relative velocity is estimated as @xmath27 where @xmath28  km / sec is the orbital speed of the earth , @xmath29 is the distance from the object to the observer in units of au , and @xmath30 is the opposition angle defined as angle from opposition to the line of sight to the background star .",
    "@xcite gave an approximation of the occultation event width as @xmath31^{\\frac{2}{3}}+         \\delta \\ , \\theta_{*}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the diameter of the object , and @xmath33 is the angular size of the occulted star .",
    "the size of the signal window is given by @xmath34 , in which @xmath35  hz is the taos sampling rate . as an example , @xmath36 for a 0.05  mas star and 3  km diameter object at 300  au and @xmath37 .",
    "we have confirmed empirically that the choice of the width of the background window is not critical , as long as it is sufficiently larger than the signal window but not so large as to average over any slowly varying trends .",
    "a typical value is about four times the size of the signal window .",
    "a noticeable negative ew index indicates a significant local cumulative flux drop over the signal window , possibly due to an occultation event .",
    "however , with single telescope data , one can not rule out the possibility that this signal has been caused by some random or other unknown processes .",
    "the advantage of a multiple - telescope system , like taos , is the ability to discriminate against such false positive events .",
    "we identify simultaneous low ew indices by _ ranking _ the ew indices in each telescope from the lowest to highest , that is , in a single lightcurve , the lowest ew measurement in the time series would have a rank @xmath38 , and the largest ew index would have rank @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the total number of ew indices from each telescope .",
    "we then calculate the parameter    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the rank of @xmath26 from telescope @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the total number of telescopes",
    ". if the ew indices are low on each telescope at a single time point , the rank product should also be very low , giving rise to a large value of @xmath45 .",
    "this is illustrated in .",
    "the left panel shows a small section of a long _ simulated _ lightcurve ( 27,000 lightcurve points for a typical taos observing run ) with an occultation by a 10  km diameter object at 1000  au with @xmath46 .",
    "an occultation was implanted at @xmath47  seconds , and is not obvious at all in any of the single lightcurves . however , after processing with the ew algorithm on the three lightcurves , the event stands out clearly ( , right ) , demonstrating the power of multi - telescope data and our analysis pipeline .",
    "the values @xmath42 are uniformly distributed and discrete over @xmath48 . if we make the approximation that the values are continuous , it can be shown ( see * ? ? ? * for example ) that if there is no correlation between the data from different telescopes , and if the variance of the ew index in a filtered lightcurve remains constant throughout the duration of a data run , the distribution of @xmath45 follows the @xmath49-distribution of the form @xmath50 this is illustrated in , which shows a histogram of @xmath45 for a single data run , along with a histogram of @xmath45 where one synthetic event was added to each lightcurve set and the test was repeated 22139 times to get the distribution . while many of the synthetic events are marginal and have low values of @xmath45 , there is clearly a significant population of events at large values of @xmath45 . to set a cut on the parameter @xmath45",
    ", we note that @xmath45 depends strongly on the value of @xmath40 , the length of the lightcurve set .",
    "since , as discussed in , this value can vary significantly due to data runs which are shortened by bad weather , we can derive a parameter which would be valid for all data runs by integrating the tail of the distribution to calculate    @xmath51    in this paper we use @xmath52 to select possible events .",
    "@xmath52 is well - suited to this application , as illustrated in which shows the histogram for a data run in which there are no evident events , and also a histogram of @xmath52 for the same data run , but with artificial events inserted into the same data .",
    "we can choose a threshold value of @xmath53 that will give a few ( if any ) candidate events yet still ensure a sufficiently high event detection efficiency .",
    "we thus set a threshold of @xmath54 , which was chosen empirically after analysis of a subset of data .",
    "the validity of this approach is demonstrated in , where we show that our detection algorithm gives a significant detection efficiency in the absence of any actual detected events .    with further analysis",
    "we will be able , in principle , to use this approach to put a rigorous upper bound on the expected false positive rate .",
    "we do not do this in this paper , and the absence of detected events , as shown below , legitimizes our decision .",
    "we determine our detection efficiency ( see section 4 ) by direct simulation , and thus translate our absence of detections into a formal upper limit on the populations of objects with orbits similar to sedna s .",
    "a customized pipeline using aperture photometry was developed to process the taos image data .",
    "this process is described in detail in @xcite , but a short summary is given below .    at the beginning of every data run , a series of stare - mode images is collected .",
    "these images are used to find the position of target stars using _ sextractor _",
    ". then these stars are cross - matched with usno - b1 star catalog @xcite and the position of all stars in the image with taos instrumental magnitude @xmath55 are extracted .",
    "an aperture mask is then created for each star identified in the stare mode image .",
    "the aperture size for each target star is optimized by the signal - to - noise ration ( snr ) of the lightcurves from first 1000 photometric measurements , and the aperture size that gives the highest snr is chosen and used .",
    "the first step in analysis of the time series zipper mode images is the subtraction of the sky background and the streaks from the brighter stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of zipper mode imaging and the origin of the streaks in the images ) .",
    "this was done by subtracting the median value of each column which effectively removed the background and streaks simultaneously .",
    "shows a subsection of a raw zipper mode images and the same image after the background and streak subtraction .",
    "the next step in the photometry process is to apply the aperture mask and add the photon counts .",
    "the position of the masks was adjusted at each timestamp to correct for any offset due to tracking errors .",
    "the offset is calculated by calculating the centroids of 20  bright stars collected at each epoch in the data run .    during the photometry pipeline process",
    ", various flags were assigned to reflect known effects that would cause faulty photometric measurements , for example , for stars that are near or at the ccd image boundary or with incorrect exposure times due to system timing errors .",
    "these errors were all recorded and the corresponding lightcurve points were flagged and removed .",
    "a complete taos data set from 2005 february 7 to 2006 december 31 , which amounts to @xmath56 three - telescope measurements was used to search for possible events by objects in sedna - like orbits .",
    "only measurements from observing runs with more than 10,000 measurements were included in the analysis , because short duration runs could not provide long enough baseline to derive significant statistics .",
    "( the duration of a normal data run is 90  minutes , however , occasional interruptions by system failures or bad weather would prevent the system from taking data with the normal duration . )",
    "removing these data runs leaves a total of 199 data runs which amounts to @xmath57  star - hours . a plot of the number of star - hours versus snr for this data set is shown in .",
    "furthermore , an additional 26  data runs were found to have significant correlations among the lightcurves for each star @xcite .",
    "removing these runs leaves us with 173  data runs , corresponding to a total of @xmath57  star hours .    meanwhile , some of the earlier observing runs suffered from guiding problems in the beginning of each run .",
    "they all happened near the first 20 seconds when the guider tried to adjust the tracking for the first time .",
    "the common feature for this problem is a large displacement in both ra and dec coordinates of every star .",
    "hence , the first minute of data runs with these large positional offsets were removed .",
    "after all bad lightcurve points were removed , the ew filter was applied to the remaining lightcurves . any rank triplets beyond our threshold of @xmath54 are flagged as candidate events .",
    "most of the candidate events identified by the ew  filter turned out to be _",
    "time coherent_. shows two such cases of the number of candidate events within a short period of time ( ten seconds ) . for example , a run with possible high altitude clouds or cirrus would cause overwhelming flux reductions for most stars at the same time .",
    "data runs exhibiting such effects are removed from further analysis .",
    "a total of 31  data runs were removed by this cut . on the other hand , during a run with low - lying moving clouds , coherent events would happen only sporadically , when the clouds cover some of the stars in the target field .",
    "data that show such time dependent patterns , which are well characterized and understood , would not be analyzed further for event detection .    as a final selection criterion , we required all candidate events to have at least three consecutive flux measurements below the nominal background level @xmath58 used to calculate @xmath59 . in the end",
    ", no candidate occultation events from objects in sedna - like orbits were found in the first two years of the taos data .",
    "for a given lightcurve set @xmath60 , the differential occultation event rate @xmath61 as a function of diameter @xmath32 and distance @xmath16 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number density of objects with diameter @xmath32 at distance @xmath16 , @xmath64 is the relative velocity between occulting object and observer during the data run ( see ) , and @xmath65 is the event width , which is assumed to be the diameter of the first airy ring of the diffraction profile as discussed in .",
    "( the subscript on @xmath66 indicates that the relative velocity depends on the angle between the target star and opposition during the data run , and the subscript on @xmath67 indicates that the event cross section depends on the angular size of the target star . )    with the event rate , we can now calculate the number of events expected to be seen for a _ given star _ during a given data run , as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the duration of the data run , and @xmath70 is the _ efficiency _ for which occultations by objects of diameter @xmath32 at distance @xmath16 are detected in the lightcurve set during the data run .    the efficiency @xmath70 was estimated by a simulation , in which we implanted occultation events in the actual light curves , and processed with the same ew filter .",
    "if we added @xmath71 events with diameter @xmath32 and distance @xmath16 to a lightcurve set and recover @xmath72 of them , the detection efficiency is simply @xmath73 .",
    "even though the impact parameter and epoch at which an occultation takes place affect if a particular event can be detected , by choosing these parameters randomly over their true distributions , we automatically average the efficiency over these parameters , and they can be ignored .",
    "we thus chose the impact parameters uniformly in the interval @xmath74 $ ] , and the event epoch uniformly in the interval @xmath75 $ ] , where @xmath76 is the start time of the data run .    with",
    "@xmath70 known , the total number of events expected to be seen in the entire data set can be estimated from .",
    "that is , @xmath77 where the sum is taken over all lightcurve sets in the taos data set .",
    "given the extremely large number of lightcurve sets , we found we could calculate a statistically significant value of the detection efficiency by adding _ only one _ simulated event to each lightcurve set .",
    "if we add events with diameter @xmath32 to a fraction @xmath78 of all lightcurve sets , and events at distance @xmath16 to a fraction @xmath79 of all lightcurve sets , we can write @xmath80 we thus choose a set of diameters @xmath32 and a set of corresponding values of @xmath78 such that @xmath81 , and a second set of distances @xmath16 and corresponding values of @xmath79 such that @xmath82 .",
    "now there would be only one event in a given lightcurve set , so , taking into account of the weighting factors of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we have the total number of expected events , expressed in the fully expanded form , @xmath83 where the sum is now over all lightcurve sets where an event of diameter @xmath32 and distance @xmath16 is recovered .",
    "this expression can be simplified as @xcite , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the _ effective solid angle _ of the survey .",
    "shows that the number of expected events @xmath86 in our survey depends on two factors , a _ model dependent _ factor @xmath87 and a _ survey dependent _ factor @xmath88 .",
    "this indicates that the number of events detected in the survey and the value of @xmath88 determined by the efficiency calculation can thus be used to place constraints on @xmath63 .    as in @xcite",

    "the distances , diameters , and weighting factors used are shown in .",
    "the weights were chosen to give preference to smaller objects where the detection efficiency is expected to be low in order to improve the statistical accuracy of @xmath88 . after implanting simulated events ,",
    "the exact same selection criteria described above were applied to find which events are recovered .",

    "we plan to modify the detection algorithm to facilitate an exact calculation of the statistical significance of candidate events , and we will subsequently complete the analysis of the second taos data set ( january 2007 to december 2008 ) and report its results in a future paper .",
    "we will also expand the analysis to include limits on the populations of scattered disk and inner oort cloud objects .",
