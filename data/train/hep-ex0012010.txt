    "one of the main goals of heavy flavour physics is to improve our knowledge of quark mixing and establish whether the standard model can describe precisely cp violating phenomena .",
    "quark mixing is given by the ckm matrix , which can be written using the wolfensteing parameterisation in terms of the three parameters @xmath2 and the cp violating phase @xmath3 : @xmath4 neutral @xmath5 meson oscillations are described by the `` box diagrams '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fey ] ) .    the oscillation frequency in the @xmath6 system , which is proportional to the mass difference of the two eigenstates , can be translated into a measurement of @xmath7 , and therefore it yields information on the cp violating phase @xmath3 ( see eq .",

    "is damped not only by the natural exponential decay , but also by the effect of the experimental resolution in the proper time determination .",
    "the proper time is derived from the measured decay length and the reconstructed momentum of the decaying meson .",
    "the resolution on the decay length @xmath15 is to first order independent of the decay length itself , and is largely determined by the tracking capabilities of the detector .",
    "the momentum resolution @xmath16 depends widely on the final state chosen for a given analysis , and is typically proportional to the momentum itself .",
    "the proper time resolution can be therefore written as : @xmath17 where the decay length resolution contributes a constant term , and the momentum resolution a term proportional to the proper time .",
    "examples of the resulting difference are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] , for the simple case of monochromatic @xmath5 mesons of momentum @xmath18 , resolutions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( gaussian ) , and for different values of the true oscillation frequency . for low frequency several periods can be observed .",
    "as the frequency increases , the effect of the finite proper time resolution becomes more relevant , inducing an overall decrease of observed difference , and a faster damping as a function of time ( due to the momentum resolution component ) . in the example given for a frequency of @xmath21 only a small effect corresponding to the first half - period can be seen .",
    "the first step for a @xmath5 meson oscillation analysis is the selection of final states suitable for the study .",
    "the choice of the selection criterion determines also the strategy for the tagging of the meson flavour at decay time .",
    "then , the flavour at production time is tagged , to give the global mistag probability    finally , the proper time is reconstructed for each meson candidate , and the oscillation is studied by means of a likelihood fit to the distributions of decays tagged as mixed or unmixed . the different selection methods and the techniques to tag the flavour at production time are briefly discussed below .",
    "up - to - date references for all the @xmath22 and @xmath23 analyses can be found at    .",
    "a variety of selection methods have been developed for @xmath10 and @xmath9 oscillation analyses , which offer different advantages in terms of statistics , signal purity and resolution .",
    "fully inclusive selections are used by sld for both @xmath22 and @xmath23 analyses . at lep",
    "they have been attempted by aleph for @xmath22 and delphi for @xmath23 .",
    "these methods yield very high statistics ( @xmath24 decays at lep , @xmath25 at sld ) .",
    "the signal fraction is what is given by nature ( @xmath26 for @xmath10 and @xmath27 for @xmath9 ) .",
    "there is no straightforward method for tagging the flavour at decay time . at lep",
    "many different variables are combined by means of a neural network , while at sld the excellent tracking capabilities allowed the development of the dipole technique , discussed later in section  [ sec : sldip ] .",
    "semi - inclusive selections rely on the identification of one specific @xmath5 meson decay product .",
    "this is typically a lepton , ( electron or muon ) , but it can be a fast kaon in the case of @xmath22 analyses ( used by sld ) .",
    "the charge of this particle gives the flavour at decay time , with small mistag probability .",
    "as for fully inclusive methods , there is no enhancement in signal fraction from the selection , and statistics are typically a factor of ten smaller .",
    "these methods are used by all experiments . in some cases",
    "an attempt is made to select a second @xmath5 meson decay product in order to enhance the signal fraction .",
    "this is typically a `` soft '' pion from the decay @xmath28 for @xmath22 analyses , a kaon with charge opposite to the lepton , or a @xmath29 , in the case of @xmath23 analyses .    in semi - exclusive selections the charmed meson from the @xmath5 meson decay",
    "is fully reconstructed : a @xmath30 or @xmath31 for @xmath22 analyses , a @xmath32 for @xmath23 analyses .",
    "the charmed meson reconstruction can be combined with the tagging of the lepton from the @xmath5 meson decay , in which case only the neutrino is undetected .",
    "these methods have substantially lower statistics , but the signal purity goes up to @xmath33 and the final state mistag probability is very small",
    ".    at lep , aleph and delphi have also attempted full reconstruction of @xmath9 decays .",
    "the selections yield only about 50 candidates , with @xmath34 estimated signal purity .",
    "nevertheless , since all the decay products are identified , these events have excellent proper time resolution , and therefore give useful information in the high frequency range .",
    "all particles of the event except those tagged as the @xmath5 meson decay products can be used to derive information on the @xmath5 meson flavour at production time .    in the hemisphere containing the b meson candidate , charged particles originating from the primary vertex , produced in the hadronization of the @xmath35 quark , may retain some memory of its charge .",
    "either the charges of all tracks are combined , weighted according to the track kinematics , or the track closer in phase space to the @xmath5 meson candidate is selected , requiring that it be compatible with a kaon for @xmath23 analyses , with a pion for @xmath22 analyses .    in the opposite hemisphere ,",
    "the charge of the other @xmath35 hadron can be tagged , exploiting the fact that @xmath35 quarks are produced in pairs .",
    "tracks from the @xmath35-hadron decay can be distinguished from fragmentation tracks on a statistical basis , from their compatibility with the primary vertex or with an inclusively - reconstructed secondary vertex .",
    "inclusive hemisphere - charges can be formed assigning weights to tracks according to the probability that they belong to the primary or the secondary vertex , complemented with more `` traditional '' jet - charges , where track weights are defined on the basis of track kinematics .",
    "furthermore , specific decay products , such as leptons or kaons , can be searched for also in the opposite hemisphere , and their charge used as an estimator of the quark charge .    finally , both at lep and at sld , the polar angle of the @xmath5 meson candidate is also correlated with the charge of the quark , because of the forward - backward asymmetry in the z decays .",
    "this correlation is particularly relevant at sld , due to the polarisation of the electron beam .",
    "many of the production - flavour estimators mentioned above are correlated among themselves .",
    "the most recent and sophisticated analyses have attempted to use efficiently all the available information by combining the different estimators using neural network techniques . in fig .",
    "[ fig : is ] the combined initial state tag variable @xmath36 is shown , for the case of the recent @xmath23 analysis with inclusive lepton tag from aleph .",

    "the lowest values for the production flavour mistag obtained at lep are just below @xmath37 , while at sld values smaller than @xmath38 are achieved .",
    "the difference is mostly due to the beam polarisation .",

    "[ fig : opal ] , for both charge combinations , together with the curve predicted for the fitted value of @xmath22 .",
    "the analysis of all the available @xmath44 peak statistics , including those collected in the years 1996 - 2000 for the detector calibration , yields : @xmath45      all the @xmath22 measurements reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd_world ] require to some extent input from simulated events .",
    "quantities derived from the simulation are affected by uncertainties on the physics processes that are simulated .",
    "these sources are common to all measurements , and they have to be treated as correlated when averaging individual results . furthermore , in order to produce consistent measurements , and hence meaningful averages , the input physics parameters used in the simulation must be the same for all analyses in all experiments . for these reasons ,",
    "all results are first adjusted to a common set of relevant input parameters , (  @xmath35-hadron lifetimes and production fractions ) .",
    "then results from sld , cdf , and the lep experiments are averaged , obtaining a first value for @xmath22 . following that , time - integrated measurements of @xmath46 from experiments at the @xmath47 resonance are considered , and translated to @xmath22 measurements .",
    "measurements of the average time - integrated mixing parameter at the @xmath44 energy ( @xmath48 ) are also considered and translated to a constraint for the @xmath9 production rate at the @xmath44 .",

    "they are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : mybd ] to the averages of the other experiments .",
    "the two babar results should not be averaged since they have some statistical and systematic correlation that has not been estimated .",
    "the asymmetric @xmath5 factories have already exceeded the statistical precision of the world average . at the moment",
    "they are quoting rather large systematic errors , which are however dominated by uncertainties on parameters that are also measured in their data .",
    "therefore the large statistics expected in the near future will allow very precise measurements to be made .",
    "the analyses completed so far are not able to resolve the fast @xmath9 oscillations : they can only exclude a certain range of frequencies .",
    "combining such excluded ranges is not straightforward , and a specific method , called `` amplitude method '' has been introduced for this purpose@xcite . in the likelihood fit to the proper time distribution of decays tagged as mixed or unmixed , the frequency of the oscillation is not taken to be the free parameter , but it is instead fixed to a `` test '' value @xmath51 .",

    "the amplitude has well - behaved errors , and different measurements can be combined in a straightforward way , by averaging the amplitude measured at different test frequencies .",
    "the excluded range is derived from the combined amplitude scan .",
    "some examples of recent and relevant analyses are presented in the following , and their statistical power discussed and compared .

    "the reconstructed mass structure consists of a narrow peak at the nominal @xmath9 mass plus a broad shoulder at lower masses due to the decays involving a with the photon undetected ( see fig .  [",

    "these methods represent a good compromise between statistics , signal purity and resolution .",
    "the signal purity achieved is typically around or above @xmath56 , with about @xmath57 combinatorial background and @xmath42 physical background from @xmath58 decays , with @xmath59 .",

    "statistics are typically a few hundred candidates .      these analyses give the highest sensitivity both at lep and at sld .",
    "lepton candidates from direct @xmath35-hadron decays are selected on the basis of the lepton kinematics ; non-@xmath35 background is suppressed by applying lifetime - based @xmath35 tagging algorithms . the charmed particle is reconstructed inclusively and intersected with the lepton to find the @xmath35 decay vertex . at lep , the resolution has typically a core of @xmath61 with tails up to 1  mm , worse than for @xmath62 final states , due to the contribution of missing or misassigned tracks . at sld",
    ", the small and precise ccd vertex detector allows a core resolution of about @xmath63 to be achieved .",
    "the neutrino momentum is estimated from the missing energy , with resolution similar to the @xmath62 case .",
    "the sensitivity of the analysis can be further improved by estimating the probability that each event be signal , instead of using the average @xmath9 fraction ( about @xmath42 ) .",
    "the total charge flowing out of the @xmath35 vertex is a good discriminant between @xmath64 and neutral @xmath35 hadrons .",
    "the presence of kaons from the primary vertex , or among the tracks assigned to the @xmath65 meson , can discriminate between @xmath9 mesons and other @xmath35 hadrons .",
    "such information can be combined into a single discriminating variable ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : enr ] ) and the signal fraction evaluated event by event , as a function of such variable .",
    "this procedure enhances the statistical power of the analyses by up to @xmath37 .      in a fully inclusive analysis , both the @xmath65 and the @xmath35 decay vertices are reconstructed topologically",
    "this requires excellent tracking capabilities , to keep the contribution of missing or misassigned tracks at an acceptable level .",
    "the method is particularly suitable for sld , where the available statistics are ten times smaller than in a lep experiment , but with much more precise tracking .    since no specific @xmath35 decay product is tagged , the flavour at decay time has to be identified with a dedicated method .",
    "sld takes advantage of the good separation between the @xmath5 and the @xmath30 meson vertices to build a variable which measures the `` charge flow '' between the two , ( `` charge dipole '' ) which exploits the fact that a @xmath9 meson decays to a @xmath66 meson , while a @xmath67 decays to a @xmath68 .",
    "the kind of separation achieved can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole ] .",
    "the statistics collected are four times larger than for the inclusive lepton analysis , which compensates for the slightly worse decay length resolution ( core of @xmath69 ) and the larger dilution in the flavour tag at decay time , yielding a very similar statistical power .",
    "the available @xmath62 and inclusive lepton analyses at lep are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : complep ] , for what concerns their statistical power .",
    "a striking feature is that the @xmath62 analysis from delphi has a slightly smaller statistical error than the aleph one at low frequency , but it becomes much worse at high frequency ( the statistical error is larger by more than a factor of two ) .",
    "similarly the slope of the error curve for the aleph inclusive lepton analysis is substantially more flat than for delphi .    a plausible reason for that is demonstrated in fig .  [ fig : comp2]a , where the aleph inclusive lepton analysis is compared with the same analysis if the event - by - event treatment of the decay length bias correction and error assignment is dropped . in the analysis",
    "the decay length is reconstructed by intersecting the charm meson candidate direction with the lepton track , and its uncertainty is estimated from the fit error .",
    "the fitted decay length needs to be corrected for a small bias caused by the selection ( bias correction ) , and the fit error must be enlarged to account for the contribution of missing or misassigned tracks ( pull correction ) .",
    "these corrections , taken from the simulation , depend strongly on the event topology : they are negligible for well measured decays where the charmed meson is almost fully reconstructed , they can be very large in other cases .",
    "parametrising carefully such corrections as a function of the event topology is mandatory to achieve a good sensitivity at high frequency .",
    "that is valid , to some extent , also for @xmath62 analyses , although the variety of topologies is more limited .",
    "these considerations suggest that a big factor could still be gained in the statistical power of the delphi analyses at high frequency analysis the fit error is not used to estimate event - by - event the decay length uncertainty : the average resolution is taken instead . ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2]b , the two best analyses from sld , the inclusive lepton and fully inclusive analyses , are compared with the corresponding best available at lep .",
    "compared to the aleph analysis , the sld inclusive lepton analysis at low frequency has errors larger by more than a factor of two , due to the smaller statistics , only partially compensated by the better flavour tag at production time ( see section  [ sec : incll ] ) .",
    "as the frequency increases , the decay length resolution becomes more and more relevant , and the two analyses become eventually equivalent .",
    "the comparison of the sld and delphi fully inclusive analyses shows the difficulty of such a method at lep .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : compexp ] the combinations of the analyses from each experiment are compared . at high frequency",

    "[ fig : ampw ] . a lower limit of is derived , while the expected limit ( sensitivity ) is .",
    "the difference is due to the positive amplitude values measured around , compatible with one , as expected in the presence of signal .",
    "the error on the amplitude at high frequency ( ) is reduced by about a factor of two compared to the world combination of summer 1999 , mostly because of the progress of the sld and aleph analyses .",
    "the amplitude spectrum can be translated to a likelihood profile , referred to the asymptotic value for ( see fig.[fig : like ] ) .",
    "a minimum is observed at @xmath70 .",
    "the deviation of the measured amplitude from @xmath71 around the likelihood minimum is about @xmath72 .",
    "such a value can not be used to assess the probability of a fluctuation , since it is chosen _ a posteriori _ among all the points of the frequency scan performed . on the other hand because the amplitude measurements at different frequencies are correlated , the probability of observing a minimum as or more incompatible with the hypothesis of background than the one found in the data , needs to be estimated with toy experiments@xcite .",
    "such a probability is found to be about @xmath73 .",
    "an interesting issue is to which extent the observation is compatible with the hypothesis of signal .",
    "this can not be assessed quantitatively in a non - trivial way . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl ] the expected amplitude shapes , calculated analytically@xcite , are shown for the simple case of monochromatic @xmath9 mesons of @xmath74 which oscillates with a frequency of @xmath75 , with different ( gaussian ) resolutions in momentum and decay length .",

    "many analyses contribute , which have very different momentum and decay length resolution . in the most sensitive analyses ,",
    "even , each event enters with its specific estimated resolutions , therefore contributing with a different expected amplitude shape .",
    "calculating the expected amplitude shape for the world combination in the hypothesis of signal is therefore , at the moment , completely impractical .",
    "it can certainly be stated , however , that qualitatively the shape observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampw ] is well compatible with the hypothesis of a signal at @xmath78 .",
