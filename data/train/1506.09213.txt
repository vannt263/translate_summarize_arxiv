    "strong couplings involving three mesons are complicated objects posing a great challenge for their theoretical study .",
    "the @xmath6 coupling , for which most theoretical analyses predicted values sizably smaller than the one later measured by cleo @xcite , illustrates this statement very well . in this letter",
    ", we address the strong three - meson couplings involving @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "these quantities can not be measured directly in strong @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays , but they are important for our understanding of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 properties in a hadronic medium @xcite .    most results for charmonium couplings arose from rather detailed qcd sum - rule calculations @xcite . in the past , however , the application of qcd sum rules to three - meson couplings faced a great problem : qcd sum rules strongly underestimated the @xmath6 coupling ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the origin of this discrepancy has not been fully clarified .",
    "we thus present an alternative analysis of the family of @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings using the relativistic dispersion approach @xcite , one of the approaches which managed to predict correctly the @xmath6 coupling @xcite before the cleo measurement .",
    "the strong couplings in the focus of our interest , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined by @xmath9 with momentum transfer @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath11 is dimensionless whereas @xmath7 has inverse mass dimension .",
    "these strong couplings are related to the residues of the poles in the transition form factors at time - like momentum transfer arising from contributions of intermediate meson states in the transition amplitudes @xmath12 channel .",
    "we study the form factors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 related to the transition amplitudes induced by vector quark currents @xmath16 or axial - vector quark currents @xmath17 : @xmath18 where dots stand for other lorentz structures .",
    "the poles in the above form factors are of the form @xmath19 in these relations , @xmath20 and @xmath21 label pseudoscalar and vector resonances with appropriate quantum numbers ; @xmath22 and  @xmath23 are the leptonic decay constants of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons , respectively , defined in terms of the amplitude of the meson - to - vacuum transition induced by the axial - vector or vector quark currents according to @xmath24",
    "relativistic constituent quark models @xcite proved to constitute an efficient tool for the study of hadron properties ,  in particular of meson decay constants and transition form factors .",
    "an essential feature of the constituent quark picture is the appropriate matching of the quark currents in qcd ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , etc . ) and the associated currents formulated in terms of constituent quarks ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , etc . ) . for light quarks , for instance , partial conservation of the axial - vector current requires the appearance of the pseudoscalar structure in the axial - vector current of the constituent quarks , similar to the case of the axial - vector current of the nucleon @xcite . for the currents containing heavy quarks ,  the matching conditions are simpler : @xmath29 where the dots indicate contributions of other possible lorentz structures @xcite .",
    "constituent quarks @xmath30 and @xmath31 have masses @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . in general , the form factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on the momentum transfer .",
    "vector current conservation requires @xmath36 at zero momentum transfer for the elastic current and at zero recoil for the heavy - to - heavy quark transition .",
    "the specific values of the form factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 and their momentum dependences belong to the parameters of the model , as well as the quark masses and the wave functions of mesons regarded as relativistic quark  antiquark bound states . a relativistic treatment of two - particle contributions to the bound - state structure may be consistently formulated within a relativistic dispersion approach which takes into account only two - particle intermediate quark - antiquark states in feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "such a formulation is explicitly relativistic - invariant : hadron observables like form factors or decay constants are given by spectral representations over the invariant masses of the quark - antiquark intermediate states .",
    "application of the dispersion formulation of the constituent quark picture to heavy - to - light meson form factors has convincingly demonstrated the reliability of this approach @xcite .      within the dispersion formulation of the constituent quark model , the decay constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 of pseudoscalar and vector mesons",
    "are expressed  in the form of relativistic spectral representations , over the invariant masses of the intermediate quark ",
    "antiquark states ,  of the spectral densities involving the nonperturbative meson wave functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively @xcite : @xmath39 with @xmath40 . the wave functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 can be written as @xmath43 with @xmath44 normalized according to @xmath45 notice that eqs .",
    "( [ fpv ] ) may be rewritten as the fourier transform of the meson relativistic wave function at the origin .",
    "similarly , the @xmath46 transition form factors induced by the constituent - quark transition current @xmath47  in the kinematical region @xmath48 is given by the double spectral representation @xmath49 the function @xmath50 is the double spectral density of the relevant feynman diagrams with constituent  quarks in the loop ( fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] ) .",
    "it contains the @xmath51-functions corresponding to the quark - antiquark thresholds and a specific constraint coming form the triangle feynman diagram .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath50 are given in sect .",
    "3.2 of @xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "we point out that at @xmath52 , the form factors obtained within the dispersion formulation are equal to the form factors of the light - front relativistic constituent quark model ( ref .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "correspondingly , the double spectral representation ( [ ff ] ) at @xmath52 may be rewritten as the convolution of the light - cone wave functions of the initial and the final hadrons ( see eq .",
    "( 2.86 ) of @xcite ) , or , equivalently , as the fourier transform in the transverse variables of the overlap of these wave functions .",
    "the merit of having explicitly relativistic - invariant spectral representations compared to other formulations is the possibility to obtain the form factors in the decay region @xmath53 by the analytic continuation in @xmath12 which was shown to lead to the appearance of the anomalous cut @xcite .",
    "noteworthy , both the normal and the anomalous contributions involve the @xmath54 and @xmath55 integrations over the corresponding two - particle cuts , i.e. for @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 given by ( [ k2 ] ) . as the result , the form factors in a broad kinematical region @xmath48 are expressed in terms of the relativistic wave functions of the participating mesons @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in this region , the precise form of the wave functions @xmath61 is not crucial ; essential is only that the confinement effects have been taken into account .",
    "that is why , as shown in the applications to meson transition form factors @xcite , a simple gaussian parameterization can be adopted : @xmath62 the spectral representation ( [ ff ] ) is based on constituent - quark degrees of freedom and we apply it to calculate the form factors in the region @xmath63 .",
    "we then numerically interpolate the results of our calculations and use the obtained parameterizations to study the form factors at @xmath64 , where one expects the appearance of meson resonance at @xmath65 .",
    "the use of the dispersion formulation of the constituent quark model allows us to reveal the intimate connection between different decay modes and to perform the calculations in the broad range of @xmath12 which includes the scattering region @xmath52 and the physical region of the quark weak decay @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , quark models are the only approach that leads to relations between the decays of different mesons through the meson wave functions  and provides the form factors in the @xmath12-range indicated above .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the form factors ( [ ff ] ) reproduce correctly the structure of the heavy - quark expansion in qcd for heavy - to - heavy and heavy - to - light transitions if the radial wave functions @xmath44 are localized in a region of the order of the confinement scale @xmath67 i.e. , @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "we also investigated the @xmath69-breaking effects in the strong couplings .",
    "the replacement of the light quark by the strange quark leads to the increase of the considered transition form factors and of the corresponding residues . at  the same time , however , also the leptonic decay constants of the charmed strange mesons considerably exceed those of their non - strange counterparts . the three - meson strong couplings are derived as ratios of the form - factor residues  and the leptonic decay constants , and , eventually , the replacement of the non - strange quark by the strange quark leads to a reduction of the three - meson couplings at the level of some @xmath70 in contrast , qcd sum rules observe an enhancement of the three - meson couplings when the light quark is replaced by the strange one .      30 s.  ahmed _ et al . _",
