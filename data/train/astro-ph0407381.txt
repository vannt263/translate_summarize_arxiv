    "recent x - ray observations show that some source of heating inhibits cooling of intracluster plasma to temperatures below roughly one - third of the average cluster temperature ( peterson et  al 2001 , peterson et  al 2003 , bhringer et  al 2001 , tamura et  al 2001 , molendi & pizzolato 2001 ) .",
    "one of the relevant heating mechanisms is conduction of heat from a cluster s hot outer region towards cluster center .",
    "fabian et  al ( 2002 ) , voigt et  al ( 2002 ) , and zakamska & narayan ( 2003 ) showed that thermal conduction can balance radiative cooling in many clusters if the thermal conductivity  @xmath0 is in the range @xmath1 , where  @xmath2 is the spitzer thermal conductivity .",
    "however , models in which cooling is balanced entirely by conduction face some difficulties .",
    "different clusters need different values of  @xmath0 to fit the observations , and it is not clear why @xmath0 would vary in the required way . relatively cool",
    "cluster plasmas can require values of  @xmath0 in excess of  @xmath2 for conduction to balance cooling , values which are difficult if not impossible to justify .",
    "theoretical studies of heat transport in tangled intracluster magnetic fields find values of  @xmath0 towards the lower end of the range of required values ( narayan & medvedev 2001 , chandran & maron 2004 , bessho , maron , & chandran 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , pure conduction models are thermally unstable , although the implications for clusters are debated since the instability growth time is long ( @xmath3  gyr for @xmath4 ) ( kim & narayan 2003 , soker 2003 ) .",
    "other heating mechanisms include dissipation of turbulent motions ( loewenstein & fabian 1990 , churazov et  al 2004 , dennis & chandran 2004 ) and turbulent mixing ( cho et  al 2003 , voigt & fabian 2004 , kim & narayan 2003 , dennis & chandran 2004 , narayan & kim 2004 ) .",
    "observational evidence of plasma motion in the perseus cluster at roughly half the sound speed  @xmath5 ( churazov et  al  2004 ) provides support for models invoking turbulent heating , but also poses a theoretical challenge for the following reason . as the rms turbulent velocity  @xmath6 varies from  @xmath7 to  @xmath5 , and as the dominant velocity length scale at radius  @xmath8 varies from  @xmath9 to  @xmath8 , the turbulent heating rate in a typical cluster varies from a value much smaller than the radiative cooling rate  @xmath10 to a value much larger than  @xmath10 ( dennis & chandran 2004 ) .",
    "if turbulent heating in fact balances radiative cooling , an explanation is needed for how the turbulence amplitude is fine - tuned to the required value .",
    "a number of authors have considered plasma heating by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) at a cluster s center .",
    "several mechanisms have been considered for transferring agn power to the ambient plasma , including buoyantly rising bubbles of cosmic rays or centrally heated gas ( tabor & binney 1993 , churazov et  al  2000 , churazov et  al  2001 , begelman  2001a , 2001b , reynolds  2001 , bruggen et  al  2002 , begelman  2002 , ruszkowski & begelman  2002 , fabian et  al  2003 , mathews et  al  2003 , reynolds et  al  2004 ) , wave - mediated plasma heating by cosmic - ray electrons ( rosner & tucker  1989 ) or cosmic - ray protons ( bhringer & morfill  1988 , loewenstein , zweibel , & begelman  1991 ) , turbulence ( loewenstein & fabian  1990 , churazov et  al  2004 ) , compton heating ( binney & tabor 1995 , ciotti & ostriker  1997 ,  2001 ) , and jet mechanical luminosity and shocks  ( binney & tabor  1995 ) . an attractive feature of agn - heating models is that the heating rate increases with the mass accretion rate of intracluster plasma , which allows the models to produce globally stable equilibria . if the mass accretion rate rises above the equilibrium value , agn heating increases , and radiative cooling of the icm is less able to cause the net cooling that drives mass accretion onto the central supermassive black hole . if the mass accretion rate falls below the equilibrium value , the net cooling rate rises , restoring the mass accretion rate to its equilibrium level . if the thermal conductivity is not dramatically reduced relative to the spitzer value , small - scale thermal instabilities are also suppressed ( rosner & tucker 1989 , ruszkowski & begelman 2002 , zakamska & narayan 2003 ) . a powerful motivation for agn - heating models is the observation that almost all clusters with strongly cooling cores possess active central radio sources ( eilek 2003 ) .",
    "the present paper builds upon previous studies of turbulent heating and agn feedback in clusters , and explores one possible explanation for how the turbulent velocity could achieve the value needed to balance radiative cooling .",
    "a steady - state model of the icm is presented in which radiative cooling causes inflow of intracluster plasma and accretion onto a central supermassive black hole , leading to cosmic - ray production by a central radio source .",
    "the cosmic - ray luminosity  @xmath11 is taken to be proportional to the mass accretion rate  @xmath12 , and it is assumed that the cosmic - rays mix completely into the thermal intracluster plasma .",
    "since the cosmic rays provide pressure without noticeably increasing the density of the icm , they increase the buoyancy of the plasma , eventually leading to convection .",
    "convection heats the plasma in three ways , through the viscous dissipation of turbulent motions , by mixing hot plasma from the outer regions of a cluster in towards cluster center , and by providing a vehicle for cosmic - ray pressure to do work on the thermal plasma .",
    "convection is treated with a two - fluid ( thermal plasma and cosmic ray ) mixing length theory developed in section  [ sec : mod ] .",
    "the turbulent velocity and turbulent heating rate increase with increasing  @xmath12 and  @xmath11 . in equilibrium , @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath11 attain those values for which turbulent heating and thermal conduction balance radiative cooling .",
    "this equilibrium is expected to be stable for the same reasons as other agn - feedback / thermal - conduction models .",
    "once the outer temperature and density are specified , the model can be used to calculate the density , temperature , and cosmic - ray pressure throughout the cluster .",
    "the model density profiles , however , are not as steep as observed profiles within the central  @xmath13  kpc , where the icm is convective .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that the cosmic - ray pressure has to be comparable to or greater than the thermal pressure within the convective region in order for cosmic - ray buoyancy to make the icm convectively unstable .",
    "the large cosmic - ray pressure gradient provides much of the support of the icm against gravity , reducing the thermal pressure gradient , and decreasing the central plasma density .",
    "a similar discrepancy was found in an mhd - wave - mediated cosmic - ray heating model ( loewenstein et  al  1991 ) , which also involved significant nonthermal pressure .",
    "the present model also provides a self - consistent calculation of the profiles of the turbulent velocity and turbulent heating rates in the  icm .",
    "the resulting velocities are subsonic , implying that convective regions are fairly close to marginal convective stability .",
    "however , because the cosmic - ray pressure modifies the stability criterion , the specific entropy of thermal plasma still increases outwards .",
    "the discrepancy between the model and observations may be linked to the assumption that cosmic rays are completely mixed into the thermal plasma .",
    "this assumption , which is made to simplify the analysis , is inconsistent with the x - ray cavities ( depressions in x - ray emission often associated with enhanced synchrotron emission ) observed in roughly one - fourth of the clusters in the chandra archive ( birzan et  al  2004 ) .",
    "when mixing is incomplete , cosmic - ray pressure is less able to support the thermal plasma , the thermal pressure gradient has to be larger , and therefore the central plasma density has to be larger . a model that accounts for incomplete mixing may have greater success .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mod ] , the model is described in detail and example solutions are compared to observations of abell  478 .",
    "section  [ sec : dis ] summarizes the results of the paper .",
    "in the cooling flow model of intracluster plasmas ( fabian 1994 ) , entropy - generating heat sources are neglected , and radiative losses are balanced by inward advection of plasma internal energy as well as gravitational and @xmath14  work .",
    "the resulting average radial velocity corresponds to mass accretion rates above  @xmath15 in some clusters .",
    "in contrast , in the present model , radiative cooling is balanced by heating from turbulence and thermal conduction , leading to much smaller radial velocities and mass accretion rates .",
    "the average fluid velocity is neglected in the fluid equations , and the mass accretion rate is set equal to bondi ( 1952 ) rate corresponding to the equilibrium plasma parameters at cluster center , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of a supermassive black hole at cluster center , @xmath18 is the central density , and @xmath19 is the adiabatic sound speed at cluster center .    the inferred mass accretion rate is used to determine the cosmic - ray luminosity through the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a dimensionless efficiency factor .",
    "the spatial distribution of cosmic - ray injection into the icm is a major uncertainty in the model .",
    "some clues are provided by radio observations , which show that cluster - center radio sources ( ccrs ) differ morphologically from radio sources in other environments . as discussed by eilek ( 2003 ) ,",
    "roughly half of the ccrs in a sample of 250 sources studied by owen & ledlow ( 1997 ) are `` amorphous , '' or quasi - isotropic , presumably due to jet disruption by the comparatively high - pressure cluster - core plasma . with the exception of hydra  a , the ccrs in the owen - ledlow ( 1997 ) study are smaller than non - cluster - center sources , with most extending less than 50  kpc from cluster center ( eilek 2003 ) . complicating matters is the possibility that cosmic - ray bubbles rise buoyantly away from their acceleration site before mixing into the thermal plasma , effectively distributing cosmic - ray injection over a larger volume . in this paper ,",
    "the cosmic - ray energy introduced into the intracluster medium per unit volume per unit time is taken to be @xmath22 where the constant  @xmath23 is a free parameter and the constant  @xmath24 is determined from the equation @xmath25 and equation  ( [ eq : lcr ] ) .",
    "the magnetic pressure is taken to be much less than the thermal pressure .",
    "magnetic terms are then neglected in the fluid equations , and the effects of the magnetic field on convection are ignored . although the magnetic field does not affect the bulk fluid velocity , for any plausible field strength the field plays an important role in heat transport by constraining charged particles to move primarily along field lines . since the magnetic field in clusters is disordered and probably turbulent ( kronberg 1994 , taylor et  al  2001 , 2002 )",
    ", chaotic field - line trajectories inhibit large radial particle excursions , suppressing radial heat transport to some degree . in this paper ,",
    "the thermal conductivity is set equal to the spitzer  ( 1962 ) value for a non - magnetized plasma ,  @xmath2 , multiplied by a suppression factor  @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 is the electron density ,  @xmath30 is the temperature , @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath32 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "recent theoretical studies suggest that  @xmath33 ( narayan & medvedev 2001 , chandran & maron 2004 , maron , chandran , & blackman  2004 ) .",

    "radiative cooling of cosmic rays is ignored , which is reasonable if protons make the dominant contribution to the cosmic - ray pressure .",

    "the thermal plasma and cosmic rays are treated as co - extensive fluids that interact only in limited ways .",
    "wave pitch - angle scattering causes the two fluids to move with the same bulk fluid velocity  @xmath41 , although the finite efficiency of scattering allows for cosmic - ray diffusion as already discussed .",
    "collisional and microphysical collisionless energy exchange between the two fluids is neglected , but the cosmic rays can heat the plasma , and vice versa , through  @xmath42 work .",

    "thermal conduction and cosmic - ray diffusion into and out of the parcel are neglected at this stage , so that the parcel expands adiabatically .",
    "the parcel is then mixed with its surroundings .",

    "the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : e3 ] ) is reminiscent of the divergence of the convective heat flux that appears in standard mixing length theory and discussions of forced turbulent mixing in clusters .",

    "in fact , @xmath158 vanishes as @xmath159 , because the total pressure perturbation in a fluid element is assumed to vanish .",
    "however , the approach taken in this paper would be similar to standard mixing length theory in the @xmath160 limit if the average velocity were retained . in a convectively unstable region , downward falling fluid elements are denser on average than upwardly rising fluid elements .",
    "the random velocities are thus associated with an inward mass flux . in standard mixing length theory , the total mass flux vanishes because a steady state without mass sources or sinks is assumed ( cox & giugli 1968 ) .",

    "one can write @xmath175 this ratio is small for the following reasons .",
    "convective regions must be close to marginal convective stability to produce the subsonic turbulent velocities required to balance cooling , which implies @xmath176 .",

    "a mean molecular weight per electron  @xmath230 of  1.18 is assumed , where  @xmath231 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , and the ratio  @xmath232 is set equal to  0.9 . and a helium fraction @xmath233 , with fully ionized hydrogen and helium ( zakamska & narayan 2003 ) . ] the values @xmath234 and  @xmath235  kev at  @xmath236  kpc are determined by linear interpolation between data points for abell  478 .",
    "density and temperature data for abell  478 from chandra observations , provided by s.  allen , are also plotted in figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "abell  478 is a highly relaxed , x - ray luminous cluster , with a cooling - flow - model mass accretion rate of  @xmath237 , and a comparatively weak central radio source ( allen et  al  1993 , sun et  al  2003 ) .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the the model density is too small for  @xmath238  kpc .",
    "this discrepancy arises because the specific entropy of the thermal plasma increases outwards , and thus the cosmic - ray pressure gradient must be large in order for the icm to be convectively unstable and for turbulent heating to help balance radiative cooling . when cosmic rays contribute a large fraction of the total pressure support , the thermal pressure gradient does not have to be as large , and thus the central plasma density does not have to be as large .",
    "a variety of model parameters have been investigated with similar results .",
    "the turbulent velocity in figure  [ fig : f1 ] is also surprisingly small .",
    "this is in part because the model underestimates the plasma density in the central  @xmath239  kpc , which weakens radiative cooling and the need for turbulent heating .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2 ] shows a numerical solution for the parameters @xmath240  km / s , @xmath241  kpc , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244  km / s , and @xmath245 , with other parameters the same as in figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the enhanced gravitational acceleration increases the density and radiative cooling , which results in the need for greater turbulent heating and a larger  @xmath246 .",
    "these parameters , however , are unrealistic since they imply a velocity dispersion of  @xmath247  km / s within the central galaxy at  @xmath248  kpc , which is much larger than observed velocity dispersions in giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "a further difficulty with the model is that a critical point is encountered for sufficiently large  @xmath40 and/or  @xmath39 , or for sufficiently small  @xmath26 .",
    "it can be shown that a sufficient condition for avoiding a critical point is that @xmath249 is everywhere less than @xmath250 , the diffusion coefficient of heat - carrying electrons , and the models plotted in figures  [ fig : f1 ] and  [ fig : f2 ] satisfy this inequality .",
    "the potential for a critical point raises a number of interesting questions , but these lie beyond the scope of this paper .    for reference , in the numerical solution plotted in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , the bondi accretion rate is @xmath251 , @xmath252  ergs / s , the radiative luminosity out to 200  kpc is  @xmath253  erg / s , and the radiative luminosity out to 600  kpc is @xmath254  ergs / s . for the model plotted in figure  [ fig : f2 ] ,",
    "the bondi accretion rate is  @xmath255 , @xmath256  erg / s , the radiative luminosity out to 200  kpc is @xmath257  erg / s , and the radiative luminosity out to 600  kpc is @xmath258  erg / s .",
    "( the luminosity out to 600  kpc is smaller in the model of figure  [ fig : f2 ] because the larger gravitational acceleration causes the density to drop off faster at large  @xmath8 . )",
    "agn feedback is a promising explanation for the heating of intracluster plasmas on both observational and theoretical grounds : there is an active radio source at the center of almost every strongly cooling cluster ( eilek 2003 ) , and agn feedback in combination with thermal conduction can lead to globally stable equilibria ( rosner & tucker 1989 , ruszkowski & begelman 2002 ) .",
    "the recent detection of moderately subsonic plasma motions in the perseus cluster ( churazov et  al  2004 ) further suggests that turbulent mixing and/or turbulent dissipation plays an important role in heating the intracluster medium .",
    "this observation also poses a theoretical challenge . for",
    "velocities in the range of those observed , turbulent heating can either overwhelm radiative cooling or be too small to offset cooling , depending on the precise value of the rms velocity  @xmath6 and the velocity length scale .",
    "if turbulent heating indeed balances radiative cooling , an explanation is needed for how  @xmath6 is fine - tuned to the required value .",
    "the model presented in this paper connects agn feedback to turbulent heating , and seeks to explain the fine - tuning of  @xmath6 . in the model ,",
    "radiative cooling of intracluster plasma is balanced by a combination of turbulent heating and thermal conduction .",
    "the turbulence is generated by convection , which in turn is produced by the buoyancy of cosmic rays generated by a central radio source .",
    "convection is a natural way for a central relativistic jet to generate turbulence due to the jet s small momentum - flux - to - energy - flux ratio : rather than a relativistic outflow stirring intracluster plasma like an oar in water , the radio source inflates the central region , allowing gravity to generate plasma momentum after parcels of plasma and cosmic rays in the central region become buoyant .",
    "a two - fluid ( plasma and cosmic ray ) mixing length theory is developed to treat convection in the  icm . by linking the turbulence amplitude to the mass accretion rate and agn feedback luminosity",
    ", the model provides an explanation for how the turbulent velocity achieves the value required for heating to balance cooling .",
    "although stability is not investigated in this paper , it is expected that the model equilibria are stable for the same reasons as other agn - feedback / thermal - conduction models .",
    "the model provides equilibrium solutions for @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and  @xmath246 once the plasma temperature and density are specified at some suitably large outer radius . for typical cluster parameters",
    ", the icm stays fairly close to marginal convective stability in convective regions , implying subsonic turbulent velocities .",
    "the principal shortcoming of the model is that the model density is too small within the central  @xmath13  kpc , where the model icm is convective .",
    "the reason is that the cosmic - ray pressure gradient must be large for cosmic - ray buoyancy to generate convection .",
    "this in turn reduces the thermal pressure gradient in the central region and decreases the central plasma density .",
    "a more realistic model of convection in the icm in which relativistic and thermal plasmas are only partially mixed may have greater success .",
