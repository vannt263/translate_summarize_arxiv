    "with the advent of the lhc particle physics will once again break into new territory at the high energy frontier . with @xmath2 tev available in the center of mass",
    ", one would naively expect that the dynamics of confinement and low - energy qcd would decouple and , thanks to factorization , have a minimal influence on high-@xmath3 observables ( a typical figure of merit being @xmath4 ) .",
    "in general , this expectation is not fulfilled . even at very high energy , for example ,",
    "no hadronic cross section can be precisely determined without a detailed knowledge of parton distributions in the colliding hadrons .",
    "furthermore , a wide range of observables of interest for both standard model and bsm physics must rely upon a definition of hadronic jets and a measurement of the jet energy scale .",
    "experience gained at the tevatron @xcite shows , for example , that a @xmath5 uncertainty in the jet energy scale causes a @xmath6 gev uncertainty in the top quark mass determination , and is reflected in a @xmath7 uncertainty in the single inclusive jet @xmath3 distribution at @xmath8 gev .    assuming a jet has been reconstructed with an infrared and collinear safe algorithm , dependent upon a parameter @xmath0 defining its size in the rapidity - azimuth plane",
    ", the energy of the jet will differ from the energy of the hard parton that originated it because of a variety of physical phenomena .",
    "radiation from the underlying event and from pileup will spill inside the jet cone , increasing its measured energy ; on the other hand , radiation produced during hadronisation will spill outside the jet cone , leading to a negative correction .",
    "it is important to realize that , while some of these corrections are definitely outside the reach of perturbative calculations ( this is certainly the case for pileup , and to a certain extent for the underlying event ) , hadronisation corrections can be explored with perturbative methods , supplemented by soft gluon resummation and power correction technology .",
    "these methods have been successfully applied to simpler processes such as @xmath9 annihilation and dis ( for a review , see  @xcite ) , where studies of event shapes showed that power corrections to distributions can be efficiently parametrized in terms of a limited number of non - perturbative parameters , enjoying a remarkable degree of universality @xcite . here",
    "we will apply for the first time these methods to jet distributions in hadron collisions , a much more challenging environment .",
    "we consider , as an example , the single inclusive jet @xmath3 distribution : we show that perturbative methods lead to a prediction for the @xmath0 dependence of the leading power correction , which turns out to be singular ( behaving as @xmath1 ) for hadronisation corrections , while , as might be expected , it grows as @xmath10 for the underlying event .",
    "we go on to compare the analytic result to monte carlo models , finding broad agreement as well as some interesting differences in the details .",
    "soft gluon resummation for the single - inclusive jet @xmath3 distribution was first performed in  @xcite , using techniques developed in   @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "since jet production in hadron collisions generically involves at least four colored partons , this is the first case in which nontrivial mixing of colour structures occurs .",
    "formally , the structure of the resummed cross section is e_j =  .",
    "[ sinclu ] the factors @xmath11 and @xmath12 exponentiate collinear logarithms associated with initial state radiation of the colliding partons , and with the measured and the recoil outgoing jets , respectively . at the level of power corrections , these factors are expected to generate contributions of order @xmath13 , associated with jet mass effects .",
    "these corrections are negligible , and therefore we will concentrate on the contributions of soft gluons emitted at wide angles from the jet , embodied in the last factor in . here",
    "the trace is taken in the space of representations of the color group that can be constructed out of the scattering hard partons , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are matrices containing hard and soft gluon contributions respectively .",
    "the exponentiation of soft radiation and the structure of color mixing can be simply understood  @xcite by resorting to the eikonal approximation .",
    "one can show that all soft logarithms can be organized in terms of eikonal colored dipoles , given by _",
    "ij ( q , q_0 ) _ q_0^q d _",
    "^(i j ) _ ^(i j ) ( _ ^(i j ) ) d t_i t_j  , [ logdip ] where the indices @xmath16 label hard partons , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the color generators in the corresponding representation , and @xmath19 is the transverse momentum with respect to the emitting dipole . for @xmath20",
    "hard partons , all products of color matrices can be expressed in terms of casimir operators , and thus there is no mixing of color structures .    before extending the discussion to power corrections",
    ", it should be noted that usage of resummations such as requires great care both in the choice and in the definition of the observable .",
    "in general jet cross sections , which involve an explicit slicing of phase space , are affected by nonglobal logarithms @xcite . in the present case , it turns out that the @xmath3 distribution is a global observable .",
    "nonglobal logarithms will generically spoil at nll level , and might influence power correction in a way which is not currently understood .",
    "one should also note that the choice of jet algorithm may affect the results quite drastically : ir safety is a must ; furthermore , we will work assuming that the jet momentum is reconstructed using four - momentum recombination .",
    "in order to analyze the structure of power corrections using the resummation , we consider separately each dipole in . for the sake of simplicity we place the measured jet at zero rapidity , which does not qualitatively affect our results .",
    "let @xmath21 be the contribution of a soft gluon with momentum @xmath22 to the observable , which we normalize as @xmath23 .",
    "note that the contribution is different if the gluon is recombined with the jet ( @xmath24 ) , or is left out of it ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "[ masterop ] note that @xmath24 is integrated inside the jet cone , and @xmath25 outside of it .",
    "the result is then a function of the jet radius @xmath0 .",
    "different dipoles give different @xmath0 dependences , with a transparent physical interpretation .",
    "the dipole constructed out of the two incoming partons has a leading power correction growing like @xmath10 , and it is natural to interpret it as the way in which the buildup of the underlying event begins to be seen from perturbation theory .",
    "dipoles involving the measured jet , on the other hand , behave as @xmath1 for small r. this behavior arises from gluons which are not recombined with the jet : at small @xmath0 , they are allowed to be emitted very close in phase space to the radiating parton , and they begin to see the corresponding collinear singularity .",
    "all dipole integrals are expressed in terms of a low - energy moment of the strong coupling , @xmath28 , which in principle could be related to the analogous quantity measured in @xmath9 annihilation . as an example",
    ", we consider the contribution of the @xmath29 channel to the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "the dipole comprising the two incoming quarks gives _ in - in ( r ) = - a ( _ f ) r j_1 ( r ) = - a ( _ f ) ( 2 r^2 - r^4 + ( r^6 ) )  . [ fin12 ] the dipole involving an incoming leg and the measured jet , on the other hand , gives _ in - j ( r ) = a ( _ f ) ( - r + r^3 + ( r^5 ) )  .",
    "[ finfin1j ] notice that , as expected , this corresponds to a _ negative _ shift in the @xmath3 distribution , given the definition of @xmath26 .",
    "we remark also that all singular contributions are essentially abelian in nature and can be directly collected into an overall shift in the physical distribution , weighed by @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) for a quark- ( gluon- ) initiated jet .",
    "terms subleading in @xmath0 , however , including , must be recombined taking color mixing into account , and their contribution is more intricate than a simple shift .",
    "a powerful cross - check of the validity of the above discussion is provided by examining hadronisation corrections for a range of jet algorithms in monte carlo simulations .",
    "we consider dijet events from both pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite and select events whose highest-@xmath3 jet at parton - level has @xmath32  gev .",
    "the selection at parton level is intended to eliminate selection bias associated with non - perturbative effects , as is appropriate for comparison with our analytical formulae . for each event",
    "we examine the average difference in @xmath33 for the two leading jets at hadron - level as compared to parton level .",
    "this difference is separated into a hadronisation component and an underlying event contribution , the latter ` defined ' as that obtained when switching on underlying event ( ue ) and/or multiple - interactions in each monte carlo program , using the default parameters of each .",
    "the ue contribution is expected to be uniform in rapidity and azimuth , scaling as @xmath34 for small @xmath0 , or as @xmath35 for general @xmath0 with @xmath36-scheme ( 4-momentum ) recombination .     associated with hadronisation and underlying - event contributions for the two leading jets in pythia 6.410 and herwig 6.510 dijet events .",

    "the rough factor of two between the hadronisation corrections for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 is consistent with the @xmath40 ratio expected from sect .",
    "one notes that the cone - type algorithms have more negative corrections , differing from the sequential recombination algorithms by a term roughly independent of @xmath0 whose explanation is beyond the scope of the single - gluon calculation given above .",
    "the ue event contribution to the jet @xmath3 is positive , as expected , and for the typical range of @xmath0 studied experimentally , @xmath41 , similar in magnitude to the hadronisation correction .",
    "it is largely identical for all algorithms , and roughly independent of the hard scattering channel .",
