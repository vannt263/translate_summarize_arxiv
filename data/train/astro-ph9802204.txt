    "classical heat transport theory applied to stars suggests that fully stably - stratified radiative transport occurs for unevolved stars with hotter effective temperatures , while cooler stars have increasingly deep convective envelopes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "astronomers have searched extensively for clear observational evidence of a transition region between those with radiative and those with convective upper layers .    in particular , @xcite suggested that stars with convective atmospheres would be approximately 0.08 magnitudes redder in @xmath4 than stars with radiative upper layers for models with the same @xmath5 , at least in the radiative - convective transition range .",
    "this implies that a population of main sequence stars with a continuous range of effective temperatures could exhibit a 0.08 magnitude jump in @xmath4 at some critical transition effective temperature @xmath6 .",
    "this theoretical phenomenon has been referred to as the `` the abrupt onset of convection '' and the apparent gap is referred to as the bhm - vitense gap .",
    "although a gap was apparent in the local population of main sequence field stars as far back as 1953 ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite first associated the gap with the onset of convection . observations of this gap in the field population ( @xcite , bhm - vitense & canterna 1974 , jasniewicz 1984 ) have generally been obtained by using spectroscopically determined luminosity classes to select only main sequence ( luminosity class v ) objects . for field stars",
    "the gap is typically in the @xmath3 range , which is consistent with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "one would imagine that such a gap , as obvious as it is in the field population , would be easily detected in open clusters .",
    "observations of clusters , however , have produced ambiguous results .",
    "for example , @xcite finds no gaps in the pleiades , while @xcite , using stricter selection criteria , does note a gap .",
    "the latter author observes the position in color of the blue edge of the bhm - vitense gap to apparently differ with cluster age .",
    "@xcite and @xcite note that there are many different gaps , while @xcite find hints of a gap , but conclude that it may not be significant .",
    "even @xcite do not see a gap in all clusters . evidently , the statistical significance , location in color space , and density depression of the gaps appears to change from cluster to cluster .",
    "one might account for the differing positions of the gaps in different clusters if rapid rotation of the stars in some clusters systematically retarded the onset of convection ( bhm - vitense & canterna 1974 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that differing rotations , and thus different critical temperatures for the onset of convection , would cause a spread in a plot of @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 .",
    "based on a sample of about 50 stars , the paper finds evidence for two branches of late a and early f stars . here",
    ", @xmath5 was determined from ultraviolet observations which probe higher atmospheric layers which were claimed by @xcite to be a better predictor of a star s @xmath5 than the @xmath4 color index .",
    "recently , however , @xcite obtained more uv observations of a and f stars and find no evidence for a bifurcation in the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) plane , and suggest that there may be no such phenomenon .",
    "an alternate explanation of the apparent gaps is suggested by figure 4 of @xcite . here",
    "one can see two depletions in the distribution of over 3500 luminosity class iv and v field stars : one at @xmath7 , and one at @xmath8 .",
    "these depletions are depicted to coincide with a relative excess of stars identified as luminosity class iii . in this letter",
    ", we use the recent publication of the full hipparcos data set ( @xcite ) to investigate whether systematics of the classification could be responsible for the gaps found by other authors .",
    "the catalog of wbvr magnitudes of northern sky bright stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) provides uniform and highly accurate photometry for @xmath9 of the stars with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . of the 9253 wbvr stars which match these criteria , 8896 stars have hipparcos proper motions . the resulting catalog is a ( @xmath0 complete ) flux - limited sample of field stars with @xmath12 derived from parallaxes .",
    "the h - r diagram for this set of stars ( fig .",
    "1a ) does not show any gaps or under - densities in the @xmath3 region of the main sequence , but rather shows a smooth distribution of stars .    over half of the stars ( 5717 ) have luminosity classes assigned to them .",
    "the h - r diagrams for luminosity class iii , iv , and v stars for which luminosity classes exist are plotted in fig 1 ( b , c , d ) .",
    "note that in figure 1d there are depletions in the stellar density at @xmath8 and at @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear from figure 1b that luminosity class iii stars fill in the @xmath13 gap in the luminosity class v h - r diagram , but it is not clear what happened to the stars in the bhm - vitense gap . examining the number of stars with luminosity classes as a function of @xmath4 , we find that for stars preceding the gap on the blue side , 60%-80% have luminosity classes ; for stars following the gap 60% have luminosity classes ; but for stars in the gap , only 35%-40% are classified . of the stars in the gap that do not have a luminosity class designation , 27% have spectral type am or ap .    in order to demonstrate the existence of a gap",
    ", @xcite used a @xcite diagram ( rank ordered plot of stars @xmath4 ) for a flux - limited sample of stars .",
    "they argue that _  for a narrow region of @xmath14 the main - sequence stars have a small range in mass so that we may expect a uniform distribution over masses and therefore over @xmath5 .",
    "any non - uniformity in the distribution over @xmath4 can then only be due to a nonuniform relation between @xmath5 and @xmath4 . \"",
    "_ we generate this rank diagram for luminosity class v field stars in figure 2 ( plotted as a thin line ) . with a factor of 20 more stars ,",
    "we still find a depletion in stellar density in the @xmath15 range which is consistent with the results of @xcite and subsequent authors .",
    "main sequence stars might naturally be defined as those stars to the left of the hertzsprung gap in the h - r diagram .",
    "we have approximated this division between main sequence and giants with the diagonal line in figure 1a .",
    "we will refer to the set of stars with @xmath16 as the `` h - r main sequence '' to distinguish it from the spectroscopic identification of luminosity class v stars .",
    "when one plots all h - r main sequence stars in the same rank diagram ( figure 2 , heavy line ) , then there is no depletion observed , and thus no confirmation that there is a nonuniform distribution of @xmath4 for these stars .",
    "the hipparcos data allows one to derive for the first time a color - magnitude diagram of a complete volume - limited sample of all stars in our solar neighborhood out to about 100 pc and down to fluxes of about @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the michigan spectral survey ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) identifies spectral types and luminosity classifications for essentially all stars in the southern hemisphere ( @xmath18 ) , complete to about @xmath19 .",
    "our volume - limited sample consists of 8156 stars with hipparcos parallax @xmath20 mas and parallax errors typically @xmath21 1 mas ( stars with errors above 30 mas are excluded ) that have been classified in the michigan spectral survey .",
    "figure 3 shows the h - r diagram by luminosity class .",
    "the magnitudes used are those included with the hipparcos input catalog ( @xcite ) , and have photometric errors of typically 0.02 mag in @xmath4 .",
    "since the houk classifications are essentially complete , we do not have the problems with missing giants or dwarfs that were apparent in figure 1 .",
    "it is apparent from figure 3 that luminosity class iii draws some a - f stars from the h - r main sequence population , leaving a well - defined gap in the luminosity class v h - r diagram .",
    "figure 4 shows the probability , as a function of @xmath4 , that a star in the h - r main sequence will be assigned a given luminosity class . in the region @xmath3 , only about @xmath22 of the h - r main sequence objects",
    "are assigned to luminosity class v. the stars with missing classifications in the @xmath4 gap are primarily of type am or ap ( a few are fm or fp ) with no luminosity class assigned . only about 5% of the luminosity class ii / iii , iii , and iii / iv stars in the gap have m or p designations . as noted by @xcite and jasniewicz ( 1984 ) , the metallic - lined a stars",
    "only partially fill the gap .",
    "the exquisite parallaxes obtained from the hipparcos mission suggest a resolution to puzzling gaps seen in the main sequence of field populations and clusters .",
    "in fact , there are no gaps in the main sequence color - magnitude diagram afforded by hipparcos parallaxes and precision photometry",
    ". highly significant instances of the bhm - vitense gap are only found in studies where the sample of stars has been separated by luminosity class .",
    "the exclusion of spectral luminosity class iii stars and stars with no luminosity class ( such as those of type am or ap ) depletes main sequence stars with @xmath23 , leaving a density shortfall or gap .",
    "unless these excluded stars are physically different from other main sequence stars and coincidently fill the gap , there is no gap caused by the sudden onset of convection .",
    "the exact place in mass , temperature and @xmath4 color where stars change over from a radiative to a convective atmosphere remains undetermined from broad band photometry .",
    "studies of stellar chromospheric activity , which is thought to be linked to convection , are also ambiguous ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting that @xcite finds a transition in the equivalent widths of the d3 absorption feature at @xmath24 , indicating that this may be the boundary between radiative and convective stars .",
    "he notes that neither his activity indicator nor those using c ii or x - rays correlates with luminosity class , suggesting that the luminosity classes may have similar surface gravities .",
    "the reason for the unexpected luminosity class identifications for late a stars remains to be investigated .",
    "we find it unlikely that the majority of h - r main sequence , luminosity class iii objects in the gap are the low surface gravity , evolved stars associated with the term  giant \" for two reasons .",
    "first , stars in the @xmath3 region have notoriously weak and ambiguous spectral luminosity class indicators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "second , the relatively large number of these objects compared to luminosity class v stars is not consistent with evolutionary tracks and lifetimes of a stars . the luminosity class iii stars in figure 3b which appear in the h - r main sequence may not , however , be mis - classified .",
    "the goal of the mk system was not to determine physical properties of stars , but rather to present a consistent evaluation of their spectra ( @xcite ) . with our analysis",
    ", we can not distinguish between misclassifications in this region ( from low signal - to - noise spectral features ) , and real physical differences in the stellar spectra .",
    "the luminosity classes in this region might be telling us more about subtle physical characteristics of the stars ( such as rotation , magnetic fields , convection , chemical composition , or binarity ) than about their surface gravities or evolutionary stages .",
    "the more global properties of the stars , based on broad band photometry , allow us to place these stars on the h - r main sequence .",
