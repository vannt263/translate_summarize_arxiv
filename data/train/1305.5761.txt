    "it is by and large agreed that the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has discovered the higgs boson predicted in the standard electroweak theory , or at any rate a particle with close resemblance to it  @xcite . at the same time , driven by both curiosity and various physics motivations , physicists have been exploring the possibility that the scalar sector of elementary particles contains more members than just a single @xmath7 doublet .",
    "a rather well - motivated scenario often discussed in this context is one containing at least one complex scalar @xmath7 triplet of the type @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "a small vacuum expectation value of the neutral member of the triplet , constrained as it is by the @xmath9-parameter , can lead to majorana masses for neutrinos , driven by @xmath10 yukawa interactions of the triplet .",
    "such mass generation does not require any right - handed neutrino , and this is the quintessential principle of the type  ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "one of the most phenomenologically striking features of this mechanism is the occurrence of a doubly - charged scalar .",
    "its signature at tev scale colliders is expected to be seen , if the triplet masses are not too far above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the most conspicuous signal consists in the decay into a pair of same - sign leptons , i.e. @xmath11 . the same - sign dilepton invariant mass peaks resulting from this make the doubly - charged scalar show up rather conspicuously .",
    "alternatively , the decay into a pair of same - sign @xmath0 bosons , i.e. @xmath12 , is dominant in a complementary region of the parameter space , which  though more challenging from the viewpoint of background elimination  can unravel a doubly - charged scalar  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall discuss the situation where a third decay channel , namely a doubly - charged scalar decaying into a singly - charged scalar and a @xmath0 of the same sign , is dominant or substantial .",
    "such a decay mode is usually suppressed , since the underlying @xmath7 invariance implies relatively small mass splitting among the members of a triplet .",
    "however , when several triplets of a similar nature are present and mixing among them is allowed , a transition of the above kind is possible between two scalar mass eigenstates .",
    "apart from being interesting in itself , several scalar triplets naturally occur in models for neutrino masses and lepton mixing based on the type  ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that in such a scenario a realization of viable neutrino mass matrices with two texture zeros  @xcite , using symmetry arguments  @xcite , requires two or three scalar triplets  @xcite . in this paper , we take up the case of two coexisting triplets . we demonstrate that in such cases one doubly - charged state can often decay into a singly - charged state and a @xmath0 of identical charge .",
    "this is not surprising , because each of the two erstwhile studied decay modes is controlled by parameters that are rather suppressed . in the case of @xmath11 ,",
    "the amplitude is proportional to the @xmath1 yukawa coupling , while for @xmath12 , it is driven by the triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the restrictions from neutrino masses as well as precision electroweak constraints makes both of these rates rather small . on the other hand , in the scenario with two scalar triplets with charged mass eigenstates @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , the decay amplitude for @xmath16 , if kinematically allowed , is controlled by the @xmath7 gauge coupling .",
    "therefore , if one identifies regions of the parameter space where it dominates , one needs to devise new search strategies at the lhc  @xcite , including ways of eliminating backgrounds .",
    "we note that the mass parameters of the two triplets , on which no phenomenological restrictions exist , are _ a priori _ unrelated and , therefore , as a result of mixing between the two triplets , the heavier doubly - charged state can decay into a lighter , singly - charged state and a real @xmath0 over a wide range of the parameter space . in that range",
    "it is expected that this decay channel dominates for the heavier doubly - charged state . by choosing a number of benchmark points ,",
    "we demonstrate that this is indeed the case .    in section  2",
    ", we present a summary of the model with a single triplet and explain why the decay @xmath17 is disfavoured there .",
    "the details of a two - triplet scenario , including the scalar potential and the composition of the physical states , are presented in section  [ 2-triplet ] .",
    "we select several benchmark points and show the decay patterns of the corresponding doubly - charged scalars in section  [ benchmark ] , where their production rates at the lhc are also presented .",
    "we point out the usefulness of @xmath16 at the lhc in the context of our model with two scalar triplets in section  [ usefulness ] .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section  [ concl ] . in appendix  [ bps ]",
    "the input parameters for the benchmark points are listed while appendix  [ expressions ] contains the formulas for the decay rates of the doubly - charged scalars .",
    "in this section we perform a quick recapitulation of the scenario with a single triplet field , in addition to the usual higgs doublet @xmath18 , using the notation of  @xcite .",
    "the higgs triplet @xmath19 is represented by the @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 the vevs of the doublet and the triplet are given by @xmath22 respectively .",
    "thus , the triplet vev is obtained as @xmath23 .",
    "the only doublet - dominated physical state that survives after the generation of gauge boson masses is a neutral scalar @xmath24 .    the most general scalar potential involving @xmath18 and @xmath25 can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 . for simplicity , we assume both @xmath28 and @xmath29 to be real and positive , which requires @xmath30 to be real as well . in other words , all cp - violating effects are neglected in this study .    the choice @xmath31 , @xmath32 ensures that the primary source of spontaneous symmetry breaking resides in the vev of the scalar doublet . without any loss of generality , we assume the following orders of magnitude for the parameters in the potential : @xmath33 small due to the @xmath9-parameter constraint , 3 .   the need to keep doublet - triplet mixing low in general , and 4 .",
    "the urge to ensure perturbativity of all quartic couplings .",
    "the mass lagrangian for the singly - charged scalars in this model is given by @xmath34 with given here is correct , whereas in equation  ( 42 ) of reference  @xcite the 11 and 22-elements of the same mass matrix are exchanged by error .",
    "] @xmath35 the field @xmath36 is the charged component of the doublet scalar field of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the eigenvalues of this matrix is zero corresponding to the goldstone boson which gives mass to the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the mass - squared of the singly - charged physical scalar is obtained as @xmath37 whereas the corresponding expression for the doubly - charged scalar is @xmath38 thus , in the limit @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40    it is obvious from the above that a substantial mass splitting between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is in general difficult .",
    "this is clear from figure  [ fig ] where we plot the mass difference between the two states for different values of @xmath43 .",
    "sufficient splitting , so as to enable the decay @xmath44 to take place with appreciable branching ratio , will require @xmath45 , @xmath46gev and a correspondingly smaller @xmath47",
    ". the limits from lep and tevatron disfavour triplet states with such low masses .",
    "thus one concludes that the phenomenon of the doubly - charged scalar decaying into a singly - charged one and a @xmath0 is very unlikely .",
    "there may , however , be some situations where a single triplet is phenomenologically inadequate .",
    "this happens , for example , when one tries to impose texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix within a type  ii seesaw framework by using abelian symmetries  @xcite .",
    "having this is in mind , we venture into a model consisting of one complex doublet and two @xmath48 triplet scalars @xmath49 , @xmath50 , both written as 2@xmath512 matrices : @xmath52 the vevs of the scalar triplets are given by @xmath53 the vev of the higgs doublet is as usual given by equation  ( [ vev ] ) .",
    "the scalar potential in this model involving @xmath18 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be written as @xmath54 where summation over @xmath15 is understood .",
    "this potential is not the most general one , as we have omitted some of the quartic terms .",
    "this is justified in view of the scope of this paper , as laid out in the introduction .",
    "moreover , due to the smallness of the triplet vevs , the quartic terms are not important numerically for the mass matrices of the scalars . as in the case with a singlet triplet",
    ", we illustrate our main point here taking all the vevs @xmath55 as real and positive , and with real values for @xmath56 as well .",
    "again , the following orders of magnitude for the parameters in the potential are assumed : @xmath57 , keeping in mind the constraint on the @xmath9-parameter .    in general , the scalar potential  ( [ pot ] ) can only be treated numerically . however , since the triplet vevs @xmath58 are small ( we will have @xmath59gev in our numerical part ) , it should be a good approximation to drop the quartic terms in the scalar triplets . in the following",
    "we will discuss the vevs and the mass matrices of the doubly and singly - charged scalars in this approximation , so that our broad conclusions are transparent .",
    "however , the numerical results presented in section  [ benchmark ] are obtained using the full potential  ( [ pot ] ) , including even the effects of the small triplet vevs .",
    "we find that the results are in very good accordance with the approximation .    for the sake of a convenient notation",
    "we define the following @xmath20 matrices and vectors : @xmath60 with this notation the conditions for a stationary point of the potential are given by @xmath61 where we have used the notation @xmath62 .",
    "these two equations are exact if one neglects all terms quartic in the triplet vevs in @xmath63 . in equation  ( [ vev2 ] ) we have already divided by @xmath28 , assuming @xmath64 . using equation  ( [ vev1 ] ) ,",
    "the small vevs @xmath58 are obtained as @xmath65 now we discuss the mass matrices of the charged scalars .",
    "a glance at the scalar potential equation  ( [ pot])neglecting quartic terms in the triplet scalars  reveals that the first two lines of @xmath66 make no difference between the singly and doubly - charged scalars .",
    "thus , the difference in the respective mass matrices originates in the terms of the third line .",
    "the mass matrix of the doubly - charged scalars is obtained as @xmath67 as for the singly - charged fields @xmath68 , one has to take into account that they can mix with @xmath36 of the higgs doublet .",
    "writing the mass term as @xmath69 equation  ( [ pot ] ) leads to @xmath70 obviously , this mass matrix has to have an eigenvector with eigenvalue zero which corresponds to the would - be - goldstone boson . indeed , using equations  ( [ vev1 ] ) and  ( [ vev2 ] )",
    ", we find @xmath71 which serves as a consistency check .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath72 largely controls the mass of the triplet scalars and the order of magnitude of its elements ( or of its eigenvalues ) is expected to be a little above the electroweak scale , represented by @xmath73gev .",
    "on the other hand , the quantities @xmath74 trigger the small triplet vevs , so they should be considerably smaller than the electroweak scale .",
    "therefore , in a rough approximation one could neglect the @xmath74 and the triplet vevs in the mass matrix @xmath75 . in that limit ,",
    "also @xmath76 and the charged would - be - goldstone boson consists entirely of @xmath36 , without mixing with the @xmath77 .",
    "the mass matrices  ( [ m++ ] ) and  ( [ m+ ] ) are diagonalized by @xmath78 respectively , with @xmath79 we have denoted the fields with definite mass by @xmath13 and @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the charged would - be - goldstone boson .",
    "the gauge lagrangian relevant for the decays considered in this paper is given by @xmath82 w_\\mu^-   \\nonumber \\\\   & &   -\\frac{g^2}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sum_{k=1}^2 w_k w^-_\\mu { w^-}^\\mu \\delta_k^{++ } + \\mbox{h.c . }",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath83 is the @xmath7 gauge coupling constant . inserting equation  ( [ uv1 ] ) into this lagrangian allows us to compute the decay rates of @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the corresponding formulas are found in appendix  [ expressions ] .",
    "the @xmath10 yukawa interactions between the triplets and the leptons are @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the charge conjugation matrix , the @xmath89 are the symmetric yukawa coupling matrices of the triplets @xmath90 , and the @xmath91 are the summation indices over the three neutrino flavours .",
    "the @xmath92 denote the left - handed lepton doublets .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is generated from equation  ( [ ll ] ) when the triplets acquire vevs : @xmath93 this connects the yukawa coupling constants @xmath94 , @xmath95 and the triplet vevs @xmath96 , @xmath97 , once the neutrino mass matrix is written down for a particular scenario . in our subsequent calculations ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first of all , the neutrino mass eigenvalues are fixed according to a particular type of mass spectrum . in this work",
    "we illustrate our points , without any loss of generality , by resorting to normal hierarchy of the neutrino mass spectrum and setting the lowest neutrino mass eigenvalue to zero .",
    "furthermore , using the observed central values of the various lepton mixing angles , the elements of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath98 can be found by using the equation @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the pmns matrix given by  @xcite @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the diagonal matrix of the neutrino masses . in equation  ( [ mnu ] ) we have dropped possible majorana phases .",
    "one can use the recent global analysis of data to determine the various entries of @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "we have taken the phase factor @xmath103 to be zero for simplicity . then , using the central values of all angles , including that for @xmath104 as obtained from the recent daya bay and reno experiments  @xcite , the left - hand side of equation  ( [ ll ] ) is completely known , at least in orders of magnitude .",
    "the actual mass matrix thus constructed has some elements at least one order of magnitude smaller than the others , thus suggesting texture zeros .    for each of the benchmark points used in the next section , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the vevs of the two triplets ,",
    "are determined by values of the parameters in the scalar potential . of course ,",
    "the coupling matrices @xmath105 and @xmath106 are still indeterminate . in order to evolve a working principle based on economy of free parameters",
    ", we fix the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath106 by choosing one suitable value for all elements of the @xmath107@xmath108 block and another value , a smaller one , for the rest of the matrix .",
    "that fixes all the elements of the other matrix .",
    "although there is a degree of arbitrariness in such a method , we emphasize that it does not affect the generality of our conclusions , so long as we adhere to the wide choice of scenarios adopted in the next section , including both small and large values of the @xmath109 yukawa couplings .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the expected changes in the phenomenology of doubly - charged scalars when two triplets are present . in general",
    ", the two scalars of this kind , namely , @xmath110 and @xmath111 can both be produced at the lhc via the drell - yan process , which can have about 10% enhancement from the two - photon channel .",
    "they will , over a large region of the parameter space , have the following decays : @xmath112 with @xmath113 in equation  ( [ hll ] ) . as we discussed in section  [ 1-triplet ] , in the context of the single - triplet model",
    "the decay analogous to equation  ( [ hhw ] ) is practically never allowed , unless the masses are very low . on the other hand ,",
    "mixing between two triplets opens up situations where the mass separation between @xmath110 and @xmath114 kinematically allows the transition  ( [ hhw ] ) . denoting the mass of @xmath115 by @xmath116 and that of @xmath117 by @xmath118 ( @xmath86 ) and using the convention @xmath119 and @xmath120 , this decay is possible if @xmath121 .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that this can naturally happen , by considering three distinct regions of the parameter space and selecting four benchmark points ( bps ) for each region .",
    "we have seen that , in a model with a single triplet , the doubly - charged higgs decays into either @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "the former is controlled by the @xmath1 coupling constants @xmath124 , while the latter is driven by the triplet vev @xmath29 . since",
    "neutrino masses are given by @xmath125 , large ( @xmath126 ) values of @xmath124 imply a small vev @xmath29 , and vice versa .",
    "accordingly , assuming @xmath127 , three regions in the parameter space can be identified , where one can have    1 .",
    "@xmath128 , 2 .",
    "@xmath129 , 3 .",
    "@xmath130 .    in the context of two triplets ,",
    "we choose three different ` scenarios ' in the same spirit , with similar relative rates of the two channels @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "four bps are selected for each such scenario through the appropriate choice of parameters in the scalar potential .",
    "the parameters for each bp are listed in appendix  [ bps ] .",
    "the resulting masses of the various physical scalar states are shown in tables  [ charged ] and  [ neutral ] .",
    "although our study focuses mainly on the phenomenology of charged scalars , we also show the masses of the neutral scalars .",
    "it should be noted that the lightest cp - even neutral scalar , which is dominated by the doublet , has mass around 125 gev for each bp .",
    "all the twelve bps ( distributed among the three different scenarios ) have @xmath133 sufficiently above @xmath134 to open up @xmath2 .",
    "the branching ratios in different channels are of course dependent on the specific bp .",
    "we list all the branching ratios for @xmath110 and @xmath111 in table  [ branching ] , together with their pair - production cross sections at the lhc with @xmath135tev .",
    "the cross sections and branching ratios have been calculated with the help of the package feynrules ( version 1.6.0 ) @xcite , thus creating a new model file in comphep ( version 2.5.4 )  @xcite . cteq6l",
    "parton distribution functions have been used , with the renormalisation and factorisation scales set at the doubly - charged scalar mass . using the full machinery of scalar mixing in this model ,",
    "the decay widths into various channels have been obtained , for which the relevant expressions are presented in appendix  [ expressions ] .",
    "the results summarised in table  [ branching ] show that , for the decay of @xmath110 , the channel @xmath136 is dominant for two of the four bps in scenario  1 and all four bps in scenarios  2 and  3 .",
    "this , in the first place , substantiates our claim that one may have to look for a singly - charged scalar in the final state that opens up when more than one doublet is present .",
    "this is because , for the bps where @xmath2 dominates , the branching ratios for the other final states are far too small to yield any detectable rates .",
    "table 3 contains the rates for pair - production of the heavier as well as the lighter doubly - charged scalar at the 14 tev run of the lhc",
    ". a quick look at these rates revals that , for the heavier of the doubly - charged scalars , it varies from about 1.4fb to 3.6fb , for masses ranging approximately between 400 and 550gev . therefore ,",
    "as can be read off from table  [ branching ] , for ten of our twelve bps , an integrated luminosity of about 500fb@xmath138 is likely to yield about @xmath139 to @xmath140 events of the @xmath141 type . keeping in mind the fact that @xmath114 mostly decays in the channel @xmath142 , such final states should _ prima facie _ be observed at the lhc , although event selection strategies of a very special nature may be required to distinguish the @xmath114 from a @xmath143 decaying into @xmath144 .",
    "the primary advantage of focusing on the channel @xmath137 is that it helps one in differentiating between the two kinds of type  ii cases , namely those containing one and two scalar triplets , respectively . in order to emphasize this point",
    ", we summarize below the result of a simulation in the context of the 14 tev run of the lhc . for our simulation ,",
    "the amplitudes have been computed using the package feynrules ( version 1.6.0 ) , with the subsequent event generation through madgraph ( version 5.12 )  @xcite , and showering with the help of pythia 8.0 .",
    "cteq6l parton distribution functions have been used .",
    "we compare the two - triplet case with the single - triplet case . in the first case",
    ", there are two doubly charged scalars , and one has contributions from both @xmath145 and @xmath146 to the leptonic final states following their drell - yan production .",
    "while the former , in the chosen benchmark points , decays into @xmath147 , the latter goes either to a same - sign @xmath0-pair or to same - sign dileptons .",
    "if one considers two , three and four - lepton final states with missing transverse energy ( met ) , there will be contributions from both of the doubly - charged scalars , with appropriate branching ratios , combinatoric factors and response to the cuts imposed .",
    "we have carried out our analysis with a set of cuts listed in table  4 , which are helpful in suppressing the standard model backgrounds .",
    "thus one can define the following ratios of events emerging after the application of cuts : @xmath148    the values of these ratios for the three scenarios of bp  3 are presented in table  5 . in each case",
    ", the ratios for the two - triplet case is presented alongside the corresponding single - triplet case , with the mass of the doubly charged scalar in the latter case being close to that of the lighter state @xmath146 in the former .",
    "both of the situations where , in the later case , the doubly charged scalar decays dominantly into either @xmath149 or @xmath150 are represented in our illustrative results .",
    "one can clearly notice from the results ( which apply largely to our other benchmark points as well ) that both @xmath151 and @xmath152 remain substantially larger in the two - triplet case as compared to the single - triplet case .",
    "one reason for this is an enhancement via the combinatoric factors in the two - triplet case .",
    "however , the more important reason is that the 4@xmath153 events survive the met cut with greater efficiency . in the single - triplet case ,",
    "the survival rate efficiency is extremely small when @xmath154 decays mainly into same - sign dileptons , the met coming mostly from energy - momentum mismeasurement ( as a result of lepton energy smearing ) or initial and final - state radiation . in the two - triplet case ,",
    "on the other hand , the decay @xmath137 leaves ample scope for having met in @xmath0-decays as well as in the decay @xmath155 , thus leading to substantially higher cut survival efficiency .",
    "thus , from an examination of such numbers as those presented in table 5 , one can quite effectively use the channel @xmath137 to distinguish a two - triplet case from a single - triplet case , provided the heavier doubly - charged state is within the kinematic reach of the lhc .    .charged scalar masses .",
