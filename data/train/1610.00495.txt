    "the h  i  kinematics are complex .",
    "there is a velocity gradient extending from southwest to northeast along a position angle of roughly 20  ( east of north ) .",

    "the h  i  moment two map shows velocity dispersions ranging from 7 - 12 kms@xmath5 , in good agreement with characteristic values determined from h  i  observations of many types of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and in particular for values determined for local volume dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the h  i  column density maximum is coincident with gas with @xmath25 @xmath8 8 kms@xmath5 .",
    "similarly , in the inner regions of the disk with active star formation , the h  i  velocity dispersion remains below 10 kms@xmath5 .    in terms of h  i  content , ngc5238 can be directly compared with the sample of 12 shield galaxies presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ngc5238 has an h  i  mass comparable to the most massive shield galaxies ; only agc749237 is more h  i - massive . the peak h  i  column density in ngc5238 is equal to the peaks found in agc110482 and in agc749237 . in the following sections we further contextualize ngc5238 against the shield sources .",

    "log(sfr@xmath29 ) = @xmath142.01 m@xmath9yr@xmath5 . averaged over a longer timescale of @xmath2100 myr , the galex far - uv emission indicates a star formation rate that is @xmath260% higher : log(sfr@xmath31 ) = @xmath141.81 m@xmath9yr@xmath5 .",
    "each of these star formation rates are higher than those of any of the shield galaxies .    to compare the neutral gas properties with the locations of recent star formation in ngc5238 , in figure  [ figcap5 ] we show multi - wavelength imaging compared to the h  i  mass surface density .",
    "the fields of view are the same in all panels .",
    "the h  i  column density contours highlight regions above 10@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "this mass surface density level has been empirically identified as the requisite level for massive star formation as traced by h@xmath1  emission @xcite ; note that more recent studies have shown that such a surface density is not universal ( e.g. , bigiel etal .",
    "2008 , elmegreen & hunter 2015 , teich etal .",
    "2016 , and the various references therein ) .",
    "the aforementioned crescent - shape morphology is very prominent in the highest column density gas .",
    "the hst images shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ figcap5 ] dramatically resolve the stellar populations in ngc5238 .",
    "the legus image @xcite shown in panel ( a ) clearly highlights the youngest stellar clusters .",
    "the most prominent of these structures is located in the southern region of the galaxy ( coincident with the southern - most extension of the 1.4@xmath1610@xmath3 @xmath4 column density contour ) ; nebular emission ( arising from the h@xmath1  spectral line , which falls in the f606w filter ) surrounds this cluster in the optical image shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "smaller young clusters , identified by a comparison of panels ( a ) and ( b ) , are located in the regions of highest h  i  column density ( n@xmath18 @xmath33 16@xmath1610@xmath32 @xmath4 , in the northeast region of the optical body ) as well as in the optical center .",
    "a close inspection of panel ( b ) reveals that nebular emission is associated with all of these clusters , and is brightest near the central , bright cluster .    as expected , the nebular emission visible in the hst image matches the morphology of the continuum - subtracted h@xmath1  image shown in panel ( d ) .",
    "the ground - based h@xmath1  image has better surface brightness sensitivity due to the comparatively narrow filter width ; this image clearly reveals widespread h@xmath1  emission throughout the galaxy .",
    "the most h@xmath1-luminous region is the central stellar cluster , followed closely by the strong h@xmath1  emission from the young stellar cluster in the southern disk .",
    "in addition to these two major maxima , there is h@xmath1  emission throughout the disk ( including regions associated with obvious uv clusters in the legus hst image ) and also multiple dramatic loops and arcs that extend significantly beyond the locations of the most luminous clusters ( for example , the nearly circular structure extending to the western edge of the disk ) .",
    "ngc5238 harbors widespread uv emission in both the galex fuv and the nuv bands .",
    "as panel ( c ) of figure  [ figcap5 ] shows , the uv emission peaks in two prominent clusters that match with the highest surface brightness h@xmath1  regions and with the the prominent uv clusters in the legus images .",
    "there is also widespread uv emission throughout the rest of the stellar disk , including emission from young , blue stars that trace the loop structure that is seen in h@xmath1  on the western side of the disk .",
    "when interpreting figure  [ figcap5 ] , it is important to note that there is a bright foreground star in close angular proximity to the central young cluster .",
    "this object appears somewhat pink in the legus image in figure  [ figcap5 ] , and is evident as an imperfectly - subtracted image artifact in the h@xmath1  image .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic aperture contains this source ; emission lines are nonetheless very prominent in the resulting spectrum ( not shown here ) , which is centered on the h@xmath1  surface brightness maximum that is slightly offset to the east .",
    "as discussed in the preceding sections , the widespread recent star formation in ngc5238 is occurring in a variety of physical conditions .",
    "the regions of highest h  i  mass surface density are h@xmath1  and uv - luminous ; however , the h  i  column density maximum is not coincident with the uv or with the h@xmath1  maxima .",
    "similarly , there is some recent star formation occurring in regions of lower h  i  column densities ( i.e. , outside of the lowest contour shown in figure  [ figcap5 ] , n@xmath18 @xmath7 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) ; such emission is especially prominent in the western portion of the disk .",
    "we now seek to quantify the degree of co - spatiality ( or lack thereof ) between h  i  mass surface density and the tracers of recent star formation ( fuv and h@xmath1  emission ) .",
    "numerous recent works have investigated empirical thresholds for star formation in the neutral and molecular ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; no single prescription has yet been identified that holds in all environments . for uniformity , thus we follow the procedures outlined in @xcite by deriving the index of the `` schmidt - kennicutt '' relation @xcite , which relates a star formation rate surface density to a gas surface density :    @xmath35    where the star formation rate surface density ( @xmath36 ) is in units of m@xmath9yr@xmath5kpc@xmath34 , the gas surface density ( @xmath37 ) in units of m@xmath9pc@xmath34 , and @xmath38 is a positive number . specifically , we compare the star formation rate surface densities ( hereafter , @xmath39 for fuv and @xmath40 for h@xmath1 ) against the h  i  mass surface densities ( hereafter , @xmath41 ) on both a radially - averaged and on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "note that because of the comparatively low star formation rates ( and correspondingly low h@xmath1  fluxes ) of the shield galaxies , @xcite did not significantly interpret h@xmath1-based radial profiles and did not show the h@xmath1-based pixel - by - pixel correlation functions .",
    "in contrast , in ngc5238 the higher star formation rate and more widespread h@xmath1  emission allows us to examine trends using both instantaneous and longer - timescale metrics .    in order to extract these diagnostics , the fuv , h@xmath1 , and h  i  moment 0 images are placed on the same coordinate grid . for the radially averaged profiles , the hst f606w image is used to fit stellar surface brightness as a function of radius with the cleangalaxy code @xcite .",
    "this program identifies a central aperture location ( in this case , spatially coincident with the fuv and h@xmath1  surface brightness maxima ) , the major and minor axis lengths of concentric ellipses in the fit , and the position angle of those ellipses . for ngc5238",
    ", the ellipses are centered at ( @xmath1,@xmath42 ) = 13@xmath1034@xmath1142.7@xmath12 , @xmath6513650.5  ( j2000 ) , with an axial ratio of 1.54 and a position angle ( measured east of north ) of 160 . following the discussion in @xcite , this corresponds to an optical inclination of 50 , which is used to deproject values per unit area .",
    "surface brightnesses in h  i , fuv , and h@xmath1  are then extracted using either these concentric apertures ( for the radially - averaged method ) or in individual , matched pixels ( for the pixel - by - pixel method ) .",
    "the results of the radially - averaged analysis are shown in figure  [ figcap6 ] . as expected based on the qualitatively similar morphologies and the similar global star formation rates in the fuv and in h@xmath1 , these radial profiles are",
    "are effectively the same using either tracer .",
    "the h  i  profile is less centrally peaked and follows a shallower slope as a function of increasing galactocentric radius . in general",
    ", this plot demonstrates that low h  i  mass surface densities are typically associated with lower star formation rate surface densities .",
    "however , it also makes clear that the regions of highest star formation rate surface density are associated with gas at a range of h  i  mass surface densities ; in the inner @xmath2500 pc of the disk , the star formation rate surface densities vary by an order of magnitude in annuli where the h  i  mass surface density is effectively constant .",
    "the radial integration used to create figure  [ figcap6 ] smears out localized variations in star formation rate surface density and h  i  mass surface density . to overcome this limitation",
    ", we quantify the localized relations between h  i , h@xmath1 , and fuv emission using the pixel - by - pixel correlation analysis shown in figure  [ figcap7 ] .",
    "the top and bottom panels show the fuv and the h@xmath1-based star formation rate surface densities as functions of the h  i  mass surface density on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "these plots quantify the local star formation law via the schmidt - kennicutt formalism ; the power - law index using each tracer is shown in each panel . the fuv slope",
    "( n @xmath7 1.46@xmath00.02 ) is slightly steeper than the h@xmath1  slope ( n @xmath7 1.17@xmath00.01 ) , suggesting a slightly stronger correlation between fuv - bright regions and the highest h  i  mass surface densities .",
    "however , these plots also highlight the ongoing and recent star formation in ngc5238 that is occurring outside the regions of densest h  i  gas .",
    "the `` canonical '' 10@xmath3 @xmath4 column density threshold ( corresponding to 7.9 m@xmath9pc@xmath34 ) is denoted by a vertical dotted line ; while most of the highest star formation rate surface densities occur above this h  i  mass surface density level , this is not a requirement .",
    "a significant amount of star formation is associated with h  i  gas that is `` sub - critical '' .",
    "low - mass galaxies such as ngc5238 offer a unique opportunity to populate the low - mass , low - velocity end of the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ; see also mcgaugh 2012 , mcnichols etal .",
    "2016 , and the various references therein ) .",
    "these low - mass systems are critical for our understanding of this fundamental scaling relation that holds over many orders of magnitude for more massive galaxies .",
    "importantly , gas - rich systems in this mass regime allow us to determine the rotational dynamics by spectral lines ; gas - poor systems must rely on dispersion measurements from stars .",
    "as discussed at length in @xcite , extracting unambiguous information about the dynamics of low - mass galaxies is notoriously difficult .",
    "that work identifies an empirical threshold of 15 kms@xmath5 , below which pressure support and coherent rotation can no longer be differentiated .",
    "modeling in three spatial dimensions is preferable to using collapsed two - dimensional representations of the data ( compare , for example , the channel maps shown in figure  [ figcap2 ] to the intensity weighted velocity field shown in figure  [ figcap4 ] ) .",
    "however , in most cases , degeneracies between inclination and rotation velocity make three - dimensional work insufficiently constrained for unambiguous solutions .    following the methodologies in @xcite , which include both two- and three - dimensional modeling approaches , we are not able to produce an unambiguous model of the rotational dynamics of ngc5238 with the present data .",
    "attempts were made to model the system as an asymmetrically distributed gas disk exhibiting coherent rotation with a strong warp .",
    "these challenges may be expected based on the narrow h  i  line width and the complex kinematics apparent in the two - dimensional velocity field ( figure  [ figcap4 ] ) .    for uniformity",
    "we thus perform a spatially resolved position - velocity ( hereafter , p - v ) analysis in ngc5238 .",
    "we first identify the kinematic major axis by inspection as that axis along which the projected velocity extent is largest . this major axis p - v slice ( of width equal to the h  i  beam size , 18 ) is centered at @xmath1,@xmath42 = ( 13@xmath1034@xmath4342.5@xmath44 , @xmath6513649.0 , j2000 ) and follows a position angle of 20  east of north ; this axis is evident in the two - dimensional velocity field shown in figure  [ figcap4 ] .",
    "note that this kinematic major axis not aligned with the optical major axis identified in   [ s3.3 ]",
    "( 160  east of north , or 20  west of north ) ; the two axes differ by @xmath240 .",
    "such misalignments of the optical and h  i  major axes are common in the shield galaxies .",
    "minor axis p - v slices ( position angle @xmath7 290  east of north ) are extracted at positions along the kinematic major axis , separated by the h  i  beam width ( 18 ) .",
    "each minor axis slice has a width equal to the h  i  beam size . in total",
    ", nine such minor axis slices are extracted ; the central minor axis slice passes through the center of the major axis slice .",
    "these minor axis slices show the intensity - weighted h  i  velocity and dispersion at a given position in the disk . as demonstrated in @xcite , @xcite , and",
    "@xcite , if projected rotation is present in a system , then the minor - axis slices will identify any such gradient as a change in the velocity of the h  i  centroid as a function of position of the slice .",
    "in figure  [ figcap8 ] we present the results of this spatially resolved p - v analysis .",
    "the major axis p - v slice identifies a total velocity gradient of 48 kms@xmath5 , spanning 60  ( 1.3 kpc at the adopted distance of 4.51 mpc ) .",
    "this is confirmed in the minor axis slices , which show a similar total velocity gradient across the disk .",
    "note that the asymmetries of the ngc5238 neutral gas disk result in some turnover in the centroid velocities of the h  i  gas in the most distant minor axis slices ( numbers @xmath64 and @xmath144 in figure  [ figcap8 ] ) ; these slices are 72  ( 1.57 kpc ) from the slice center . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that ngc5238 has a projected rotational velocity of 24 kms@xmath5 , and that this rotation can be unambiguously identified to a maximum physical radius of 1.3 kpc .",
    "as discussed at length in @xcite , the correction of the observed velocities for inclination is the most significant uncertainty in the analysis of the dynamics of low - mass galaxies . following that work",
    ", we use the optical inclination derived in   [ s3.3 ] to correct the observed h  i  for projection effects and thus to determine the true rotational velocity .",
    "our inclination value of ( 50@xmath05 )  compares favorably with the value of 55  implied by the axial ratios derived from the uv images in @xcite ; our measurement agrees within @xmath25  with the implied inclination of 40  from the @xcite ir apertures .",
    "the resulting circular velocity of ngc5238 is 31@xmath05 kms@xmath5 , measured to a maximum physical radius of 1.3 kpc using gas detected at 3@xmath25 significance or higher .",
    "the implied dynamical mass using @xmath45 is ( 3@xmath01)@xmath1610@xmath46 m@xmath9 .",
    "this can be compared to 3.7@xmath1610@xmath46 m@xmath9  when also explicitly accounting for random motions in the h  i  gas as demonstrated in @xcite ; for this calculation we assume the average h  i  velocity dispersion throughout the disk ( 8.5 kms@xmath5 ; see figure  [ figcap4 ] ) . correcting the total h  i  mass for helium and other metals ( a 35% correction ) ,",
    "the total gas mass of ngc5238 is ( 3.7@xmath00.3)@xmath1610@xmath17 m@xmath9 . using the stellar mass in table  1 ,",
    "the total baryonic mass is 1.3@xmath1610@xmath46 m@xmath9 ; ngc5238 is dark - matter dominated at a roughly 2.4:1 ratio , a value like those found for the shield galaxies in @xcite .",
    "these values allow us to place ngc5238 on the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btfr ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figcap9 ] , ngc5238 agrees with the calibration of the btfr presented in @xcite and updated to include the shield sample in @xcite .",
    "ngc5238 follows the same scaling relation between rotational velocity and baryonic mass as the shield galaxies .",
    "ngc5238 shares many physical characteristics with the most massive galaxies from the shield sample .",
    "formally , if the right ascension and declination of ngc5238 placed it inside the alfalfa survey footprint @xcite , it would not have been not met all of the shield survey selection criteria .",
    "it would meet the w@xmath20 @xmath47 65 kms@xmath5  line width criterion but would fail the h  i  mass criterion ( log[m@xmath48 @xmath47 10@xmath22 ) ; ngc5238 is @xmath275% too h  i - massive to have been selected for shield .",
    "note , however , that stellar - based distances to many of the shield galaxies @xcite moved them further than the initial distance estimates upon selection .",
    "the final shield sample presented in @xcite and @xcite contains 4 sources with log(m@xmath49 ) @xmath50 10@xmath22 ; one of these sources ( agc749237 ) is more h  i - massive than ngc5238 .",
    "qualitatively , the physical properties of ngc5238 bridge the regime between the extremely low - mass shield galaxies and the more massive dwarf irregular galaxies in the local group and beyond . as figure  [ figcap9 ] demonstrates , this source populates the region of the btfr that is sparesly populated by the highest - mass shield galaxies and the lowest - mass galaxies studied in @xcite .",
    "the h  i  disk of ngc5238 is larger ( physical diameter @xmath84 kpc at largest extent ) than those of all of the shield galaxies except for agc749237 , which is of comparable size .",
    "the peak h  i  column density in ngc5238 is the same as the highest peaks seen in the shield galaxies ( agc110482 and agc749237 ) .",
    "interestingly , the kinematics of ngc5238 are significantly more confused than those of the most massive shield galaxies ; agc749237 , agc112521 , and agc110482 show comparatively ordered rotation in two - dimensional velocity fields .",
    "ngc5238 , in contrast , shows complex kinematics ; two- and three- dimensional rotationally - supported disk modeling fails in this comparatively massive source .    as discussed in section  [ s3.2 ] ,",
    "the fuv and h@xmath1 star formation rates of ngc5238 are higher than those of any of the shield galaxies @xcite .",
    "the origin of the high star formation rate in ngc5238 compared to those in the shield galaxies is not immediately clear .",
    "there are no known galaxies cataloged in the nasa extragalactic database within a projected separation of 300 kpc whose recessional velocities are within 100 kms@xmath5  of the v@xmath18 @xmath7 232@xmath01 kms@xmath5  derived in this work ( see discussions in lelli etal .",
    "2014 and martinkus etal .  2015 ) .",
    "while the outer h  i  disk of ngc5238 does show some asymmetries , we do not detect unambiguous evidence for an ongoing tidal interaction at the current sensitivity and angular resolution of our vla observations .",
    "we note that recent work suggests that interactions at large distances may not be important for star formation rates in dwarf galaxies ( see , e.g. , pearson etal .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the distributed recent star formation in ngc5238 differentiates it from most of the shield galaxies . in those systems ,",
    "almost all of the galaxies show h@xmath1  emission that is concentrated to a few isolated hii regions or at most some faint diffuse emission .",
    "in contrast , ngc5238 harbors widespread h@xmath1  emission with both clustered and diffuse morphology . from the far - uv perspective , the shield galaxies show a variety of morphologies ; some sources have widespread far - uv emission throughout most of the inner disk , while others show only very faint far - uv emission .",
    "again ngc5238 stands out in a comparative sense : the entire inner disk is uv - bright , which is unlike the shield galaxies .",
    "we have presented new vla h  i  spectral line observations of the nearby star - forming dwarf irregular galaxy ngc5238 .",
    "the data resolve the structure and dynamics of the neutral gas on spatial ( @xmath2400 pc ) and spectral ( 1.56 kms@xmath5ch@xmath5 ) scales that can be meaningfully compared to other major h  i  survey results .",
    "the outer portions of the neutral gas disk show significant asymmetries . the high mass surface density h  i  gas displays an interesting crescent - shaped morphology , with the highest h  i  column densities in excess of 1.5@xmath1610@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the new h  i  images are compared with images from hst , galex , and the bok 2.3 m telescope in order to study the nature of the recent star formation in ngc5238 .",
    "the stellar disk is resolved into multiple stellar clusters by the hst legus images @xcite , and there is an exquisite match between the uv - bright stellar population and the h@xmath1  emission that permeates much of the inner disk .",
    "the most luminous uv clusters are associated with high column density gas ( n@xmath18 @xmath8 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) , but there are a significant number of uv - bright stars in regions of lower column densities as well .",
    "the regions of highest h  i  mass surface densities are not co - spatial with the most luminous uv and h@xmath1  sources .",
    "we quantify the degree of co - spatiality between h  i  and star formation tracers using both radially averaged and pixel - by - pixel star formation rate density analyses .",
    "the far - uv results are qualitatively similar to those found for the properties of star formation in the shield galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1  emission in ngc5238 is significantly more widespread than in the shield galaxies .",
    "the kennicutt - schmidt indices are n @xmath7 1.46@xmath00.02 and n @xmath7 1.17@xmath00.01 in the fuv and in h@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath1-based value is steeper than the value found for the composite shield sample ( n @xmath7 0.68@xmath00.04 ) in @xcite , but is in good agreement with the values found in the individual shield galaxies with the highest star formation rates and the highest h  i  mass surface densities .",
    "the complex neutral gas dynamics of ngc5238 preclude an unambiguous two or three - dimensional model of the rotation of the source ; degeneracies persist between inclination and rotation velocity . as for the shield galaxies analyzed in @xcite , we use spatially - resolved position velocity analysis to estimate the projected rotation velocity of the galaxy .",
    "we correct this value for inclination based on an elliptical fit to the red stellar population seen by hst .",
    "the resulting rotational velocity v@xmath51 @xmath7 ( 31@xmath05 ) kms@xmath5  implies a total dynamical mass of 3@xmath1610@xmath46 m@xmath9 . comparing to the sum of the neutral gas and stellar masses , ngc5238 is dark matter dominated at a ratio of roughly 2.4:1 .",
    "the galaxy falls on the baryonic tully - fisher relation as presented in @xcite .",
    "ngc5238 is an intriguing system that warrants further study .",
    "higher angular resolution h  i  imaging could reveal small - scale feedback processes between the multiple stellar clusters and the surrounding neutral gas .",
    "the stellar population is well - resolved by hst , making possible a detailed study of the recent star formation history .",
    "the significant nebular emission would facilitate detailed and resolved analysis of the chemical composition of the system .",
    "the preliminary estimates of the metallicity ( z @xmath8 19%z@xmath9 ; moustakas & kennicutt 2006 ) place this system near the empirical boundary below which co emission becomes extremely difficult to detect in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while single - dish co observations by @xcite failed to detect ngc5238 , the high star formation rate and significant h  i  mass surface densities suggest that targeted interferometric observations could be fruitful .",
