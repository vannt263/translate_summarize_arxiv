    "following  @xcite , we further pursue the goal of an axiomatization of the category of categories based on the comprehensive factorization system ( cfs for short ) . here",
    ", the emphasis is on the simultaneous consideration of both the cfs s @xmath4 and @xmath5 on @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the class of final ( initial ) functors and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the class of discrete ( op)fibrations . rather than on the duality functor @xmath11",
    ", we rest on the following  reciprocal stability \" property : _ the pullback of an initial ( final ) functor along a discrete ( op)fibration is itself initial ( final ) _ ( proposition  [ 4 ] ) .",
    "a  balanced factorization category \" is a finitely complete category @xmath0 with two factorization systems on it , which are reciprocally stable in the above sense and generate the same subcategory of  internal sets \" : @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that these simple axioms are remarkably powerful , allowing to develop within @xmath0 some important aspects of category theory in an effective and transparent way .",
    "in particular , the reflection of an object @xmath13 in @xmath14 gives the internal set of components @xmath15 , while the reflections of a ",
    "point \" @xmath16 in @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the slice @xmath19 and the coslice @xmath20 , with their maps to @xmath1 .",
    "one can define two functors @xmath3 , which on @xmath13 give the  underlying \" categories @xmath21 and @xmath22 . furthermore , if @xmath23:= x\\bs x \\times_x x / y$ ] , the internal set @xmath24 $ ] enriches both @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "also composition in @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be enriched to a natural  symmetrical \" composition map @xmath29 , and it follows in particular that the underlying categories are dual .",
    "in fact , the term  balanced \" is intended to reflect the fact that the objects of @xmath0 carry two dual underlying categories , coexisting on the same level .",
    "it is the choice of one of the two factorization systems which determines one of them as  preferred \" : in fact , we will make only terminologically such a choice , by calling  final \" (  initial \" ) the maps in @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and  discrete fibrations \" (  opfibrations \" ) those in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . for example",
    ", we will see that the underlying functor @xmath3 determined by @xmath4 preserves discrete fibrations and opfibrations , final and initial points , slices and coslices and left and right adjunctible maps , while the other one reverses them .",
    "the structure of balanced factorization category also supports the notion of  balanced \" cylinder and  balanced \" homotopy .",
    "in particular , for any @xmath30 we have a cylinder ( see  @xcite ) @xmath31^i\\ar@<-.5ex>[r]_e & x[x , y ] \\ar[r]^c &   x(x , y ) } \\ ] ] with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and pulling back along an element of @xmath35 ( corresponding to an arrow @xmath36 as defined above ) we get the  arrow interval \" @xmath37 $ ] : @xmath38^i\\ar@<-.5ex>[r]_e & [ \\alpha ] } \\ ] ] which in @xmath6 is the category of factorizations of @xmath39 with the two factorizations through identities .",
    "another consequence of the axioms is the following exponential law ( proposition  [ 78 ] ) : if @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the exponential @xmath42 exists in @xmath2 , then it is in @xmath18 . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath40 has a  complement \" ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) : @xmath43 then it is valued in @xmath18 ( and conversely ) . in the balanced factorization category of posets ( see section  [ ex ] ) , the internal sets are the truth values and the above enrichment gives the standard identification of posets with @xmath44-categories , while the complement operator becomes the usual ( classical ) one , relating upper - sets and lower - sets .",
    "we here stress some properties of @xmath6 and of the comprehensive factorization systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 , on which we will model the abstraction of sections  [ emcat ] and  [ bal ] .",
    "recall that given two functors @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the map ( or  comma \" ) construction @xmath47 yields as particular cases the slices @xmath48 or coslices @xmath49 , for any object @xmath16 .",
    "more generally , @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be obtained as the pullbacks [ 1 ] @r=4pc@c=4pc p / x & x / x + p ^p & x @r=4pc@c=4pc xq & xx + q ^q & x in particular , the pullback [ 2 ] @r=4pc@c=4pc [ x , y ] & x / y + xx & x is the category of factorizations between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which has as objects consecutive arrows @xmath54 and @xmath55 in @xmath1 , and as arrows the diagonals @xmath56 as below : [ 3 ] @r=3.5pc@c=3.5pc x ^ _ & z ^ + z ^^ & y applying the components functor @xmath57 we get @xmath58=x(x , y)$ ] .",

    ", there is an obvious  slice functor \" of @xmath66 at @xmath52 : [ 3b ] e_f , x : x / xy / fx      recall that a functor is a discrete fibration if it is orthogonal to the codomain functor @xmath67 , or , equivalently , if the object mapping of the slice functor @xmath68 is bijective , for any @xmath65 .",
    "a functor @xmath45 is final if @xmath69 for any @xmath65 .",
    "for example , an object @xmath70 is final iff it is terminal ( @xmath71 ) , the identity ( or any isomorphism ) @xmath72 is final ( @xmath73 , since @xmath20 has an initial object and so it is connected ) and @xmath74 is final iff @xmath1 is connected ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "final functors and discrete fibrations form the  left \" comprehensive factorization system @xmath4 on @xmath6 , which is in fact the ( pre)factorization system generated by @xmath76 . since any @xmath4-factorization gives a reflection in @xmath17 ( see section  [ emcat ] ) we have a left adjoint @xmath77 to the full inclusion of @xmath78 in @xmath79 .",
    "the  reflection formula \" ( see  @xcite and  @xcite , and the references therein ) [ 3a ] ( p)x ( xp ) gives its value at @xmath52 .",
    "dually , the domain functor @xmath80 generates the  right \" cfs @xmath5 : initial functors and discrete opfibrations ( this is the cfs originally considered in  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the reflection of an object @xmath16 in @xmath17 is the slice projection @xmath81 ( corresponding to the representable presheaf @xmath82 ) and the universal property of the reflection reduces to the ( discrete fibration version of the ) yoneda lemma .",
    "so , a functor to @xmath1 is isomorphic in @xmath79 to the slice projection @xmath83 iff it is a discrete fibration whose domain has a terminal object over @xmath52 .",
    "dually , if @xmath84 is the reflection in discrete opfibrations , @xmath85 in @xmath18 is the coslice projection .",
    "on the other hand , the reflection of @xmath86 in @xmath87 gives the components of @xmath1 , that is , @xmath88 can be identified with the components functor @xmath89 .",
    "the same of course holds for @xmath90 .    [ 4 ] the pullback of an initial ( final ) functor along a discrete ( op)fibration is itself initial ( final )",
    ".    the two statements are clearly dual .",
    "if in the diagram below @xmath91 is final , @xmath66 is a discrete opfibration , both squares are pullbacks and @xmath92 is a @xmath5-factorization of @xmath16 , [ 5 ] @r=4pc@c=4pc & xp & p _",
    "p & q ^q + 1^i & xx ^x & x ^f & y we want to show that @xmath93 is connected .",
    "since @xmath94 is a discrete opfibration whose domain has an initial object , it is a coslice of @xmath95 : @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is a @xmath5-factorization ) ; then the vertex of the pullback rectangle is @xmath98 , which is connected by hypothesis .",
    "throughout the section , @xmath0 will be an @xmath4-category , that is a finitely complete category with a factorization system on it .      for a brief survey on factorization systems and the associated bifibrations on @xmath0",
    "we refer also to  @xcite . we just recall that an @xmath4-factorization of a map @xmath64 in @xmath0 @xmath99^e\\ar[dr]_f   & z \\ar[d]^m \\\\                        & y            } \\ ] ] gives both a reflection of @xmath100 in @xmath101 ( with @xmath102 as reflection map ) and a coreflection of @xmath103 in @xmath104 ( with @xmath105 as coreflection map ) .",
    "conversely , any such ( co)reflection map gives an @xmath4-factorization .",

    "then by orthogonality there is a unique map in @xmath107 $ ] from any left point to any right one , and an @xmath4-factorization of @xmath66 is a  middle point \" of the interval @xmath107 $ ] : it is final among left points and initial among right ones .",
    "the above point of view may be reinforced by geometrical intuition ( as discussed at length in  @xcite ) .",
    "a map @xmath64 is a figure in @xmath95 of shape @xmath1 ( or a cofigure of @xmath1 in @xmath95 )",
    ". a left point of @xmath107 $ ] factorizes the figure through an  infinitesimal modification \" of @xmath1 , while a right point factorizes it through a  local aspect \" of @xmath95 .",
    "the middle point of the interval @xmath107 $ ] @xmath99^{e_f } & n(f ) \\ar[r]^{m_f } & y } \\ ] ] factorizes the figure through its  neighborhood \" @xmath110 .",
    "if monic maps are concerned , a left point is an  infinitesimal enlargement \" of @xmath1 with respect to the embedding @xmath66 in @xmath95 , while a right point is an",
    " open \" part of @xmath95 which contains @xmath66 .",
    "then the ( infinitesimal ) neighborhood @xmath110 is both the smallest open part of @xmath95 containing @xmath66 and the biggest infinitesimal enlargement of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath66 . in this vein , maps @xmath111 in @xmath9 are characterized as  local homeomorphisms \" ( if @xmath112 is a figure of @xmath1 , then @xmath113 gives the neighborhood @xmath114 ) ; on the other hand , maps @xmath115 in @xmath7 preserve  global aspects \" : if @xmath116 is a cofigure of @xmath95 and @xmath117 is the corresponding maximal infinitesimal enlargement of @xmath95 in @xmath118 , then @xmath119 is a maximal  infinitesimal enlargement \" @xmath120 of @xmath1 in @xmath118 .",
    "however , our intuition of  infinitesimal modification \" should be broad enough to include , say , the dense inclusion of a part of a topological space in another one , and also the reflection map of a space in its set of components @xmath121 .",
    "for example , if @xmath122 , components are one of the  global aspects \" preserved ( in the above sense ) by final functors .",
    "we now define and analyze several @xmath4-concepts , which assume their usual meaning when @xmath122 with the left comprehensive factorization system ( see also  @xcite , where the same topics are treated in a slightly different way , and other classical theorems are proved ) .",
    "we say that a map @xmath33 is * final * , while a map @xmath123 is a * discrete fibration * ( df ) .",
    "we assume that a  canonical \" factorization of any arrow in @xmath0 has been fixed , and denote by @xmath77 the corresponding left adjoint to the full inclusion @xmath124 .",
    "if @xmath125 is a discrete fibration , we say that @xmath126 is an * internal set * or also a * @xmath0-set * ( or simply a set ) and we denote by @xmath127 the reflective full subcategory of @xmath0-sets ; @xmath14 is closed with respect to limits in @xmath0 , and so is itself finitely complete .",
    "the reflection @xmath128 is the * components * functor .",
    "so a final map @xmath129 to a set , that is a factorization of the terminal map @xmath86 , gives the set @xmath130 of components of @xmath1 , with the following universal property :    [ 6 ] @r=3pc@c=3pc x ^e@/^1.5pc/[rr ] & s ^m @ .. >[r ] & s ^n + & 1 & that is , @xmath131 is initial among _ sets _ with a map from @xmath1 and , as remarked in section  [ fact ] , it is also final among objects with a _ final _",
