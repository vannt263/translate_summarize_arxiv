    "recent theoretical and experimental advances in optics have raised the prospect to realize nonhermitian systems with a real spectrum but nonorthogonal wave functions .",
    "these efforts are based on the concept of @xmath0 symmetry , originally formulated as a variant of quantum mechanics in which potentials can be complex @xcite . in the optical context",
    "such potentials can be realized via absorbing and amplifying regions . in a @xmath0-symmetric situation , a discrete unitary operation ( such as a reflection or inversion )",
    "maps the absorbing onto the amplifying parts , with matching absorption and amplification rates . on the level of classical optics , absorption and amplification",
    "are related by an antiunitary time - reversal operation .",
    "if the absorption and amplification rates are low enough , the spectrum of the composed system is real , but beyond a threshold pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues appear .",
    "this transition ( known as spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking ) can be exploited to realize a number of exotic optical effects , such as unidirectional transmission @xcite , absorption - enhanced transmission @xcite , power oscillations @xcite , nonlinear switching @xcite , and coexistence of lasing and perfect absorption @xcite . at the transition point ,",
    "eigenvalues coalesce , resulting in an _ exceptional point _ where the two eigenmodes become degenerate not only in frequency , but also share the same wave function @xcite .",
    "this singular scenario receives considerable attention also for optical systems without @xmath0 symmetry @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate how the unavoidable consequences of _ leakage _ , _ instability _ , and _ quantum noise _ affect the characteristics of realistic @xmath0-symmetric resonators . in combination ,",
    "we find that these effects offer a window to directly access the signatures of nonhermiticity .",
    "in particular , they allow to detect mode nonorthogonality , which discriminates these systems from ordinary hermitian systems that possess a real spectrum but feature mutually orthogonal eigenmodes .",
    "in realistic devices , additional losses arise due to _ leakage _ , as radiation needs to be coupled out of the system .",
    "even though these losses break exact @xmath0-symmetry , signatures of the associated peculiar spectral characteristics are still present in the complex resonance frequencies of the open system .",
    "the coalescence of eigenvalues at the spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking transition then translates to situations where two resonance frequencies approach each other very closely in the complex plane .    in actively amplifying optical systems",
    ", the appearance of real eigenfrequencies indicates an _ instability _ , the onset of lasing .",
    "the consequences for @xmath0-symmetric systems have been explored only since very recently . in these systems ,",
    "the lasing threshold is either reached in the limit of the closed system ( if the spectrum in this limit is real ) @xcite , or at finite leakiness ( if @xmath0 symmetry in the closed system is spontaneously broken , i.e. , beyond an exceptional point ) @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the system is in practice stabilized by saturation in the amplifying parts , thereby assuring that the output intensity remains finite .",
    "this saturation provides a physical mechanism that breaks the balance of amplification and absorption required for @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "an ordinary laser emits coherent radiation with a narrow emission line that can be well approximated by a lorentzian . according to general laser theory @xcite",
    ", the width @xmath1 of the lorentzian arises due to noise , of which a certain amount , _ quantum noise _ , is an unavoidable consequence of the quantum nature of microscopic emission events .",
    "investigations on purely amplifying ( not @xmath0-symmetric ) systems established a direct link of nonhermiticity and an enhanced line broadening ( known as excess noise ) , which are both captured by a measure of mode nonorthogonality , the petermann factor @xmath2 @xcite . at an exceptional point , @xmath2 diverges because of the coalescence of resonance wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-symmetric systems offer an ideal venue where the consequences for the radiated intensity in this singular case can be explored .",
    "more generally , one should expect for such systems that the excess noise provides a probe of the level of nonhermiticity also away from an exceptional point .",
    "the preceding observations capture our principal motivation for this work .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to formulate a theory of the quantum noise and radiation of leaky @xmath0-symmetric optical systems in the full range of situations far below , near , and beyond the reconfiguration of the spectrum at an exceptional point , up to the point where the lasing threshold is reached .",
    "this requires a quantum optical treatment , which we base on the scattering input - output formalism @xcite , as previously applied to purely amplifying systems @xcite . taking the absorbing parts of the system into account",
    ", we establish general relations for the output intensity as for the previously studied case of a homogeneously amplifying resonator , but find that this involves a nontrivial combination of aspects from mode nonorthogonality and excess noise . as one approaches an exceptional point , the partial intensities of the two near - degenerate resonances still diverge , but the combined amplitude remains finite , which signals a change in the lineshape from a lorentzian to a squared lorentzian ( as also observed at exceptional points in passive scattering theory @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate these general results on quantum noise for a specific quasi one - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric resonator , which displays the generic spectral properties of previously studied resonators @xcite and offers additional control via a variable leakage to the exterior .",
    "this application extends the investigation in ref .",
    "@xcite , which used the input - output formalism to study a @xmath3-symmetric resonator with well isolated resonances and did not address the relation to mode nonorthogonality . throughout our derivations , we also present general expressions that apply to systems with amplifying and absorbing regions , even when these are not related by @xmath0 symmetry ( as recently investigated , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : ii ] reviews the spectral features of closed and open @xmath0-symmetric systems , as well as the signatures of excess quantum noise for conventional , amplifying resonators , with the discussion based in both cases on the common framework of ( first- and second - quantized ) scattering theory . in section [ sec : iii ] we adapt the scattering input - output formalism to resonators with absorbing parts and derive general expressions for the output radiation intensity . in the central section [ sec : iv ] , we analyze this radiation near resonance and establish the link to mode nonorthogonality .",
    "section [ sec : v ] sees our general results applied to a specific @xmath0-symmetric resonator set - up .",
    "we first study the classical wave problem and determine the resonance frequencies and exceptional points .",
    "we then analyze the output radiation in the vicinity of these frequencies and verify the sensitivity to the nonorthogonality of modes , as well as the emergence of a squared lorentzian at the exceptional points .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly review the ( ` first - quantized ' , classical - wave ) scattering approach to the determination of eigenfrequencies and resonances in closed and open nonhermitian @xmath0-symmetric systems , as well as the application of the ( ` second - quantized ' , quantum - optical ) scattering input - output formalism to the problem of excess noise in purely amplifying systems .",
    "sections  [ sec : iii ] and [ sec : iv ] then extend the latter to partially absorbing systems , including those with @xmath0 symmetry . throughout , we identify @xmath4 with the energy of photons ( effectively setting @xmath5 ) .",
    "while scattering appears most naturally in the context of transport through open systems , the scattering framework can also serve as a convenient technique to determine spectral properties , such as the resonance eigenfrequencies of these systems , or even the bound - state spectrum of closed systems @xcite . in scattering theory",
    "the eigenfrequencies are determined efficiently using a small number of basis functions , which are the on - shell ( fixed energy or frequency ) solutions in various , artificially separated ( and therefore open ) parts of the system , which then are coupled together using their scattering matrices .",
    "the quantization condition follows from the consistency requirement of the matching conditions . in the present work",
    ", the use of scattering theory is further motivated by the fact that it also can serve as a framework for introducing quantum noise .",
    "indeed , we will find that the steps in the derivation of the quantization condition ( given here ) and in the implementation of quantum noise in composed systems ( given in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] ) closely resemble each other . in this first part of background material , we therefore review the general ideas of spectral analysis in scattering theory , and also describe the consequences for systems with @xmath0 symmetry @xcite ( for other aspects of @xmath0-symmetric scattering theory see refs .",

    "we start with the definition of the relevant scattering matrix . consider a classical wave equation , e.g. , the helmholtz equation @xmath6 for tm polarized light in a two - dimensional dielectric resonator , where scattering , absorption , and amplification enter via the dielectric index @xmath7 ( here @xmath8 is the speed of light in vacuum ) .",
    "assuming @xmath9 , we have @xmath10 in amplifying regions , while in absorbing regions @xmath11 .",

    "@xmath15 is the scattering matrix , whose dimensions depend on the number of incoming and outcoming propagating modes at the given frequency @xmath4 . for a system where modes are coupled in from a left or right entrance ,",
    "the scattering amplitudes can be collected into reflection blocks @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as well as transmission blocks @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( where the prime discriminates whether the incident radiation comes from the left or right , respectively ) , such that @xmath20    in the special case that amplification and absorption are absent ( so that the refractive index @xmath21 is real ) , and if the frequency is real as well , the scattering matrix is unitary , @xmath22 .",

    "these solutions are identical to the eigenvalues of the ( possibly nonhermitian ) underlying hamiltonian .",
    "the interest in @xmath0 symmetry for nonhermitian systems arises because this provides a mechanism where at least part of the spectrum can still be real . in the scattering formalism",

    "however , the quantization condition can also have complex solutions , which then occur in complex - conjugated pairs .",
    "the transition between both situations involves pairs of frequencies that coalesce on the real axis , and then move into the complex plane , where they remain related by complex conjugation .",
    "typically , this transition is driven by increasing the nonhermiticity ( the trend does not need to be strict ; sometimes pairs of resonance frequencies become real when the nonhermiticity is increased ) .",
    "however , the transition also depends on the coupling of the absorbing and amplifying regions , and indeed can be induced by reducing this coupling @xcite .",
    "( in the trivial limit where the two regions are decoupled , they both possess a fully complex spectrum . )",
    "while @xmath39 symmetry leaves wavefunctions of real eigenvalues invariant , it interchanges those of complex - conjugated pairs , which are therefore not @xmath39-symmetric when taken each on their own @xcite .",
    "this entails that at the point of degeneracy the two wavefunctions have to collapse , thereby resulting in an exceptional point , which is the generic degeneracy scenario in nonhermitian systems @xcite . for the case of the helmholtz equation , this behavior can be quantified on the basis of the bi - orthogonality relation @xmath40 which holds for any two resonance modes @xmath41 , @xmath42 , even if the refractive index is complex .",
    "as one approaches the exceptional point , @xmath43 is shared between the two degenerate eigenvalues , and the wave function becomes self - orthogonal , @xmath44      for a leaky ( geometrically open ) system , such as a resonator confined by semitransparent mirrors , the eigenfrequencies are generally shifted into the complex plane , corresponding to resonance frequencies of quasibound states with decay rate @xmath45 .",
    "these quasibound states fulfill the wave equation with purely outgoing boundary conditions . for a passive system ,",
    "their decay rates are positive . in the presence of amplification counteracting the leakage",
    ", individual resonances can cross from the lower to the upper half of the complex plane .",
    "this signifies an instability , which in optics corresponds to the laser threshold @xcite .",
    "the complex resonance spectrum can again be obtained from scattering theory @xcite . including the leakage channels to the outside , the scattering matrices of the left and right parts assume a natural block structure @xmath46 which now also contains scattering amplitudes related to reflection and transmission from and to the exterior regions [ i.e. , from the left and right entrances into these subsystems ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "the internal matching conditions still only involve the reflection blocks @xmath47 of the left system and @xmath48 of the right system , and thus remain of the form .",

    "when the system is almost closed , the eigenfrequencies are only slightly shifted downwards into the complex plane .",
    "the transition of the spectrum from real to complex is then replaced by a spectral rearrangement in which complex resonance frequencies approach each other very closely by moving together roughly parallel to the real axis , and then depart from each other into the direction of the imaginary axis @xcite .",
    "when two complex frequencies meet in an exact degeneracy , one again reaches an exceptional point , where the wavefunctions of two resonance modes collapse and become self - orthogonal , in accordance to eq .  .",
    "a practical method to probe the spectrum of a resonator is to fill it with an active , amplifying medium and observe the ensuing emitted radiation intensity . far above the lasing threshold",
    ", one then observes coherent radiation with a narrow lorentzian emission line @xcite @xmath56 where the line width @xmath57 is dictated by noise . for the reference point of an almost closed purely amplifying resonator ( the prototypical _ good - cavity laser _ ) ,",
    "the quantum limit of the line width is given by the schawlow - townes relation @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 , while @xmath60 is the cold - cavity decay rate in the passive resonator [ corresponding to a real refractive index in eq .  ] .",
    "this noise is due to spontaneous emission events , which are incoherent and result in phase fluctuations , while amplitude fluctuations are suppressed by the feedback from the medium @xcite . in the linear regime just below the lasing threshold , on the other hand , where the emitted radiation is incoherent , amplitude and phase fluctuations are both present and equal each other , so that the schawlow - townes relation reads @xmath61    both versions of the schawlow - townes relation require absence of absorption and assume orthogonal resonator modes , so that crosstalk between photons emitted into different modes can be ignored . in order to identify corrections due to the violation of these assumptions , it is advantageous to concentrate on the linear regime just below threshold , where the emitted intensity can be calculated conveniently in the scattering input - output formalism @xcite",
    ". results can be translated to the lasing regime by the simple rule that there the quantum - limited line width is still reduced by a factor of two @xcite . in the remainder of the background section",
    "we collect results for the previously studied case of purely amplifying systems @xcite , focussing only on some key points as the details of the derivation are encompassed by our more general considerations in secs .",
    "[ sec : iii ] and [ sec : iv ] .",
    "the formalism starts with the classical wave equation , e.g. , the helmholtz equation . for a passive system ( with a real refractive index )",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath15 is unitary , @xmath62 , but in presence of amplification this condition no longer holds .",
    "a physical consequence is the appearance of quantum noise .",
    "when amplitudes are promoted to annihilation operators @xmath63 , eq.([eq : inout1 ] ) with nonunitary @xmath64 is not compatible with the bosonic commutation relations for both sets of operators .",
    "this problem can be fixed by introducing auxiliary bosonic operators @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 the commutation relations for @xmath67 and @xmath68 are now compatible if @xmath69 .",
    "this constraint has the status of a fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "it admits solutions when @xmath70 is equipped with at least as many columns as rows , but does not fix @xmath70 completely .",
    "however , subject to reasonable physical assumptions , the constraint is sufficient to calculate the output intensity of the system in terms of its classical wave scattering properties .    for illustration",
    "we consider the case of total population inversion ( @xmath71 ) and no incoming radiation .",
    "the frequency - resolved output intensity is then of the form @xcite @xmath72 the final expression no longer contains the matrix @xmath70 and therefore can be calculated purely based on the classical wave problem . in the vicinity of resonant emission frequencies , where the scattering matrix diverges",
    "[ see eqs .   and ]",
    ", the radiated intensity is large .",
    "linearizing in the deviation from the resonance condition , one generally finds a lorentzian line shape @xmath73 which features an extra factor @xmath2 so that the schawlow - townes relation eq .",
    "is replaced by @xmath74 the factor @xmath2 is known as the petermann factor @xcite , and can often be related to mode nonorthogonality @xcite . for the helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helm ] ) , this factor takes the explicit form @xcite @xmath75 which holds also in presence of inhomogeneity in the refractive index and the gain . for a homogeneously amplifying resonator",
    ", this reduces to siegman s original expression @xcite @xmath76    the connection of the excess noise to mode nonorthogonality becomes apparent when one considers the combination ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] ) @xcite @xmath77 which appears in the numerator of eq .  .",
    "the self - orthogonality condition implies that this combination diverges at an exceptional point . in general , the integral in the denominator of eq .",
    "can be interpreted as a suitably weighted overlap integral of the left eigenfunction @xmath78 and the right eigenfunction @xmath79 , which represents the scalar product between these two types of eigenfunction ( the stated simple relation of left and right eigenfunctions holds because the potential in the helmholtz equation is scalar , but breaks down in the presence of vector potentials @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , expressions and both imply @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is only obtained in the limit of a passive , closed system , in which the wave function is real . in more physical terms , on the other hand , expression ( [ eq : k ] ) signifies that the excess noise is generated in the amplifying parts of the system , since the passive parts ( with real refractive index ) do not contribute to the integrals .",
    "clearly , this duality of interpretations of the petermann factor in terms of mode nonorthogonality and excess quantum noise breaks down in presence of absorbing parts of the system .",
    "the mode nonorthogonality is then also induced by the absorbing regions with a positive imaginary part of the refractive index , but these on their own do not create any radiation .",
    "one of the main goals of the present work is to identify the role of the petermann factor in the presence of such absorbing elements .",
    "we focus on @xmath0-symmetric systems , as their peculiar spectral properties imply that one can also easily steer close to an exceptional point , and examine how the total output intensity is regularized despite a divergent petermann factor . in the remainder of this paper , we therefore first set up a theory of quantum noise in simultaneous presence of absorbing and amplifying regions , and then identify signatures of nonhermiticity , mode - nonorthogonality , and exceptional points in the output radiation intensity , followed by an illustration for a specific @xmath0-symmetric system .",

    ", we assume that the absorbing and amplifying regions are spatially separated . for @xmath0-symmetric systems , this assumption is rather natural , as the @xmath87 symmetry is usually of a geometric nature , such as a reflection @xmath88 about a plane perpendicular to the @xmath89-axis . to be specific ,",
