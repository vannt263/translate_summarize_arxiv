    "the weak decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark are employed for tests of the standard model and measurements of its parameters .",
    "they offer the most direct way to determine the weak mixing angles , to test the unitarity of the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , and to explore the physics of cp violation .",
    "at the same time , hadronic weak decays also serve as a probe of that part of strong - interaction phenomenology which is least understood : the confinement of quarks and gluons inside hadrons .",
    "the structure of weak interactions in the standard model is rather simple .",
    "flavour - changing decays are mediated by the coupling of the charged current to the @xmath2-boson field . at low energies ,",
    "the charged - current interaction gives rise to local four - fermion couplings , whose strength is governed by the fermi constant @xmath3 according to the structure of the these interactions , the weak decays of hadrons can be divided into three classes : leptonic decays , in which the quarks of the decaying hadron annihilate each other and only leptons appear in the final state ; semileptonic decays , in which both leptons and hadrons appear in the final state ; and non - leptonic decays , in which the final state consists of hadrons only .",
    "representative examples of these three types of decays are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : classes ] .",
    "the simple quark - line graphs shown in this figure are a gross oversimplification , however . in the real world",
    ", quarks are confined inside hadrons , bound by the exchange of soft gluons .",
    "the simplicity of the weak interactions is overshadowed by the complexity of the strong interactions .",
    "a complicated interplay between the weak and strong forces characterizes the phenomenology of hadronic weak decays . as an example , a more realistic picture of a non - leptonic decay is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlep ] .",
    "clearly , the complexity of strong - interaction effects increases with the number of quarks appearing in the final state .",
    "bound - state effects in leptonic decays can be lumped into a single parameter ( a `` decay constant '' ) , while those in semileptonic decays are described by invariant form factors , depending on the momentum transfer @xmath4 between the hadrons .",
    "approximate symmetries of the strong interactions help to constrain the properties of these form factors . for non - leptonic decays , on the other hand , we are still far from having a quantitative understanding of strong - interaction effects even in the simplest decay modes .",
    "= 8.5 cm    over the last decade , a lot of information on heavy - quark decays has been collected in experiments at @xmath5 and hadron colliders .",
    "this has led to a rather detailed knowledge of the flavour sector of the standard model and many of the parameters associated with it .",
    "there have been several great discoveries in this field , such as @xmath6@xmath7 mixing  @xcite , charmless @xmath1 decays  @xcite@xmath8@xcite , and rare decays induced by penguin operators  @xcite .",
    "the experimental progress in heavy - flavour physics has been accompanied by a significant progress in theory , which was related to the discovery of heavy - quark symmetry and the development of the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the excitement about these developments is caused by the fact that they allow ( some ) model - independent predictions in an area in which `` progress '' in theory often meant nothing more than the construction of a new model , which could be used to estimate some strong - interaction hadronic matrix elements . in these notes",
    ", we explain the physical picture behind heavy - quark symmetry and discuss the construction , as well as simple applications , of the heavy - quark expansion . because of lack of time",
    ", we will have to focus on some particularly important aspects , emphasizing the main ideas and concepts of the hqet .",
    "a more complete discussion of the applications of this formalism to heavy - flavour phenomenology can be found in some recent review articles  @xcite .",
    "the reader is also encouraged to consult the earlier review papers  @xcite@xmath8@xcite on the subject .",
    "hadronic bound states of a heavy quark with light constituents ( quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) are characterized by a large separation of mass scales : the heavy - quark mass @xmath9 is much larger than the mass scale @xmath10 associated with the light degrees of freedom .",
    "equivalently , the compton wave length of the heavy quark ( @xmath11 ) is much smaller than the size of the hadron containing the heavy quark ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "our goal will be to separate the physics associated with these two scales , in such a way that all dependence on the heavy - quark mass becomes explicit .",
    "the framework in which to perform this separation is the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite .",
    "the hqet provides us with a convenient technical tool to construct the ope .",
    "before we start to explore in detail the details of this effective theory , however , we should mention two important reasons why it is desirable to separate short- and long - distance physics in the first place :    * a technical reason is that after the separation of short- and long - distance phenomena we can actually calculate a big portion of the relevant physics ( i.e.  all short - distance effects ) using perturbation theory and renormalization - group techniques . in particular , in this way we will be able to control all logarithmic dependence on the heavy - quark mass . *",
    "an important physical reason is that , after the short - distance physics has been separated , it may happen that the long - distance physics simplifies due to the realization of approximate symmetries , which imply non - trivial relations between observables .",
    "the second point is particularly exciting , since it allows us to make statements beyond the range of applicability of perturbation theory .",
    "notice that here we are not talking about symmetries of the full qcd lagrangian , such as its local gauge symmetry , but approximate symmetries realized in a particular kinematic situation .",
    "in particular , we will find that an approximate spin  flavour symmetry is realized in systems in which a single heavy quark interacts with light degrees of freedom by the exchange of soft gluons .",
    "at this point it is instructive to recall a more familiar example of how approximate symmetries relate the long - distance physics of several observables .",
    "the strong interactions of pions are severely constrained by the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd . in a certain kinematic regime , where the momenta of the pions are much less than 1  gev ( the scale of chiral - symmetry breaking ) , the long - distance physics of scattering amplitudes is encoded in a few `` reduced matrix elements '' , such as the pion decay constant . an effective low - energy theory called chiral perturbation theory",
    "provides a systematic expansion of scattering amplitudes in powers of the pion momenta , and thus helps to derive the relations between different scattering amplitudes imposed by chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we will find that a similar situation holds for the case of heavy quarks .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry implies that , in the limit where @xmath13 , the long - distance physics of several observables is encoded in few hadronic parameters , which can be defined in terms of operator matrix elements in the hqet .",
    "there are several reasons why the strong interactions of systems containing heavy quarks are easier to understand than those of systems containing only light quarks .",
    "the first is asymptotic freedom , the fact that the effective coupling constant of qcd becomes weak in processes with large momentum transfer , corresponding to interactions at short - distance scales  @xcite . at large distances ,",
    "on the other hand , the coupling becomes strong , leading to non - perturbative phenomena such as the confinement of quarks and gluons on a length scale @xmath14  fm , which determines the size of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath15 gev is the energy scale that separates the regions of large and small coupling constant . when the mass of a quark @xmath16 is much larger than this scale , it is called a heavy quark .",
    "the quarks of the standard model fall naturally into two classes : up , down and strange are light quarks , whereas charm , bottom and top are heavy quarks . for heavy quarks ,",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath17 is small , implying that on length scales comparable to the compton wavelength @xmath11 the strong interactions are perturbative and similar to the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "in fact , the quarkonium systems @xmath18 , whose size is of order @xmath19 , are very much hydrogen - like .",
    "systems composed of a heavy quark and light constituents are more complicated , however .",
    "the size of such systems is determined by @xmath20 , and the typical momenta exchanged between the heavy and light constituents are of order @xmath10 .",
    "the heavy quark is surrounded by a most complicated , strongly interacting cloud of light quarks , antiquarks , and gluons . in this case",
    "it is the fact that @xmath21 , i.e.  that the compton wavelength of the heavy quark is much smaller than the size of the hadron , which leads to simplifications . to resolve the quantum numbers of the heavy quark",
    "would require a hard probe ; the soft gluons exchanged between the heavy quark and the light constituents can only resolve distances much larger than @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the light degrees of freedom are blind to the flavour ( mass ) and spin orientation of the heavy quark .",
    "they experience only its colour field , which extends over large distances because of confinement . in the rest frame of the heavy quark , it is in fact only the electric colour field that is important ; relativistic effects such as colour magnetism vanish as @xmath23 .",
    "since the heavy - quark spin participates in interactions only through such relativistic effects , it decouples . that the heavy - quark mass becomes irrelevant",
    "can be seen as follows : as @xmath23 , the heavy quark and the hadron that contains it have the same velocity . in the rest frame of the hadron ,",
    "the heavy quark is at rest , too .",
    "the wave function of the light constituents follows from a solution of the field equations of qcd subject to the boundary condition of a static triplet source of colour at the location of the heavy quark .",
    "this boundary condition is independent of @xmath9 , and so is the solution for the configuration of the light constituents .",
    "it follows that , in the limit @xmath23 , hadronic systems which differ only in the flavour or spin quantum numbers of the heavy quark have the same configuration of their light degrees of freedom  @xcite@xmath8@xcite .",
    "although this observation still does not allow us to calculate what this configuration is , it provides relations between the properties of such particles as the heavy mesons @xmath1 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , or the heavy baryons @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( to the extent that corrections to the infinite quark - mass limit are small in these systems ) .",
    "these relations result from some approximate symmetries of the effective strong interactions of heavy quarks at low energies .",
    "the configuration of light degrees of freedom in a hadron containing a single heavy quark with velocity @xmath29 does not change if this quark is replaced by another heavy quark with different flavour or spin , but with the same velocity .",
    "both heavy quarks lead to the same static colour field .",
    "for @xmath30 heavy - quark flavours , there is thus an su@xmath31 spin  flavour symmetry group , under which the effective strong interactions are invariant .",
    "these symmetries are in close correspondence to familiar properties of atoms : the flavour symmetry is analogous to the fact that different isotopes have the same chemistry , since to a good approximation the wave function of the electrons is independent of the mass of the nucleus .",
    "the electrons only see the total nuclear charge .",
    "the spin symmetry is analogous to the fact that the hyperfine levels in atoms are nearly degenerate .",
    "the nuclear spin decouples in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry is an approximate symmetry , and corrections arise since the quark masses are not infinite . in many respects ,",
    "it is complementary to chiral symmetry , which arises in the opposite limit of small quark masses .",
    "however , whereas chiral symmetry is a symmetry of the qcd lagrangian in the limit of vanishing quark masses , heavy - quark symmetry is not a symmetry of the lagrangian ( not even an approximate one ) , but rather a symmetry of an effective theory , which is a good approximation of qcd in a certain kinematic region .",
    "it is realized only in systems in which a heavy quark interacts predominantly by the exchange of soft gluons . in such systems",
    "the heavy quark is almost on shell ; its momentum fluctuates around the mass shell by an amount of order @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding fluctuations in the velocity of the heavy quark vanish as @xmath33 .",
    "the velocity becomes a conserved quantity and is no longer a dynamical degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , results derived on the basis of heavy - quark symmetry are model - independent consequences of qcd in a well - defined limit .",
    "the symmetry - breaking corrections can , at least in principle , be studied in a systematic way . a convenient framework for analyzing these corrections",
    "is provided by the heavy - quark effective theory . before presenting a detailed discussion of the formalism , we shall first point out some of the important implications of heavy - quark symmetry for the spectroscopy and weak decays of heavy hadrons .",
    "the spin  flavour symmetry leads to many interesting relations between the properties of hadrons containing a heavy quark .",
    "the most direct consequences concern the spectroscopy of such states  @xcite . in the limit @xmath23 , the spin of the heavy quark and the total angular momentum @xmath34 of the light degrees of freedom inside a hadron",
    "are separately conserved by the strong interactions .",
    "because of heavy - quark symmetry , the dynamics is independent of the spin and mass of the heavy quark .",
    "hadronic states can thus be classified by the quantum numbers ( flavour , spin , parity , etc . ) of the light degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the spin symmetry predicts that , for fixed @xmath35 , there is a doublet of degenerate states with total spin @xmath36 .",
    "the flavour symmetry relates the properties of states with different heavy - quark flavour .",
    "in general , the mass of a hadron @xmath37 containing a heavy quark @xmath16 obeys an expansion of the form @xmath38 the parameter @xmath39 represents contributions arising from all terms in the lagrangian that are independent of the heavy - quark mass  @xcite , whereas the quantity @xmath40 originates from the terms of order @xmath0 in the effective lagrangian of the hqet . for the moment , the detailed structure of these terms is of no relevance ; it will be discussed at length in the next section . for the ground - state pseudoscalar and vector mesons",
    ", one can parametrize the contributions from the @xmath0 corrections in terms of two quantities , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in such a way that  @xcite @xmath43\\,\\lambda_2 \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath44 is the total spin of the meson .",
    "the first term , @xmath45 , arises from the kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside the meson ; the second term describes the interaction of the heavy - quark spin with the gluon field .",
    "the hadronic parameters @xmath39 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are independent of @xmath9 .",
    "they characterize the properties of the light constituents .",
    "consider , as a first example , the su(3 ) mass splittings for heavy mesons .",
    "the heavy - quark expansion predicts that @xmath46 where we have indicated that the value of the parameter @xmath39 depends on the flavour of the light quark .",
    "thus , to the extent that the charm and bottom quarks can both be considered sufficiently heavy , the mass splittings should be similar in the two systems .",
    "this prediction is confirmed experimentally , since  @xcite @xmath47    as a second example , consider the spin splittings between the ground - state pseudoscalar ( @xmath48 ) and vector ( @xmath49 ) mesons , which are the members of the spin - doublet with @xmath50 .",
    "the theory predicts that @xmath51 the data are compatible with this : @xmath52 assuming that the @xmath1 system is close to the heavy - quark limit , we obtain the value @xmath53 for one of the hadronic parameters in ( [ fnrela ] ) .",
    "this quantity plays an important role in the phenomenology of inclusive decays of heavy hadrons  @xcite .",
    "a third example is provided by the mass splittings between the ground - state mesons and baryons containing a heavy quark .",
    "the hqet predicts that @xmath54 this is again consistent with the experimental results @xmath55 although in this case the data indicate sizeable symmetry - breaking corrections . for the mass of the @xmath27 baryon",
    ", we have used the value @xmath56 which is obtained by averaging the result  @xcite @xmath57  mev with the value @xmath58  mev reported by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the dominant correction to the relations ( [ barmes ] ) comes from the contribution of the chromo - magnetic interaction to the masses of the heavy mesons , baryons . ] which adds a term @xmath59 on the right - hand side .",
    "including this term , we obtain the refined prediction that the values of the following two quantities should be close to each other : @xmath60 this is clearly satisfied by the data .",
    "the mass formula ( [ massexp ] ) can also be used to derive information on the heavy - quark ( pole ) masses from the observed hadron masses .",
    "introducing the `` spin - averaged '' meson masses @xmath61  gev and @xmath62  gev , we find that @xmath63 where @xmath64 is used as a generic notation representing terms suppressed by three powers of the @xmath65- or @xmath66-quark masses .",
    "using theoretical estimates for the parameter @xmath41 , which lie in the range  @xcite@xmath8@xcite @xmath67 this relation leads to @xmath68 where the first error reflects the uncertainty in the value of @xmath41 , and the second one takes into account unknown higher - order corrections .",
    "semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons have received a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "the decay channel @xmath69 has the largest branching fraction of all @xmath1-meson decay modes . from a theoretical point of view , semileptonic decays are simple enough to allow for a reliable , quantitative description .",
    "the analysis of these decays provides much information about the strong forces that bind the quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry implies relations between the weak decay form factors of heavy mesons , which are of particular interest .",
    "these relations have been derived by isgur and wise  @xcite , generalizing ideas developed by nussinov and wetzel  @xcite , and by voloshin and shifman  @xcite .",
    "consider the elastic scattering of a @xmath1 meson , @xmath70 , induced by a vector current coupled to the @xmath65 quark . before the action of the current , the light degrees of freedom inside the @xmath1 meson orbit around the heavy quark , which acts as a static source of colour .",
    "on average , the @xmath65 quark and the @xmath1 meson have the same velocity @xmath29 .",
    "the action of the current is to replace instantaneously ( at @xmath71 ) the colour source by one moving at a velocity @xmath72 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.3 ] .",
    "if @xmath73 , nothing happens ; the light degrees of freedom do not realize that there was a current acting on the heavy quark . if the velocities are different , however , the light constituents suddenly find themselves interacting with a moving colour source .",
    "soft gluons have to be exchanged to rearrange them so as to form a @xmath1 meson moving at velocity @xmath72 .",
    "this rearrangement leads to a form - factor suppression , which reflects the fact that as the velocities become more and more different , the probability for an elastic transition decreases .",
    "the important observation is that , in the limit @xmath74 , the form factor can only depend on the lorentz boost @xmath75 that connects the rest frames of the initial- and final - state mesons .",
    "thus , in this limit a dimensionless probability function @xmath76 describes the transition .",
    "it is called the isgur  wise function  @xcite . in the hqet , which provides the appropriate framework for taking the limit @xmath74 , the hadronic matrix element describing the scattering process",
    "can thus be written as @xmath77 here , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the velocity - dependent heavy - quark fields of the hqet , whose precise definition will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : hqet ] .",
    "it is important that the function @xmath80 does not depend on @xmath81 .",
    "the factor @xmath82 on the left - hand side compensates for a trivial dependence on the heavy - meson mass caused by the relativistic normalization of meson states , which is conventionally taken to be @xmath83 note that there is no term proportional to @xmath84 in ( [ elast ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by contracting the matrix element with @xmath85 , which must give zero since @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is more conventional to write the above matrix element in terms of an elastic form factor @xmath88 depending on the momentum transfer @xmath89 : @xmath90 where @xmath91 . comparing this with ( [ elast ] ) , we find that @xmath92 because of current conservation , the elastic form factor is normalized to unity at @xmath93 .",
    "this condition implies the normalization of the isgur  wise function at the kinematic point @xmath94 , i.e.  for @xmath73 : @xmath95 it is in accordance with the intuitive argument that the probability for an elastic transition is unity if there is no velocity change . since for @xmath73",
    "the daughter meson is at rest in the rest frame of the parent meson , the point @xmath94 is referred to as the zero - recoil limit .",
    "we can now use the flavour symmetry to replace the @xmath65 quark in the final - state meson by a @xmath66 quark , thereby turning the @xmath1 meson into a @xmath24 meson .",
    "then the scattering process turns into a weak decay process . in the infinite mass limit ,",
    "the replacement @xmath96 is a symmetry transformation , under which the effective lagrangian is invariant .",
    "hence , the matrix element @xmath97 is still determined by the same function @xmath76 .",
    "this is interesting , since in general the matrix element of a flavour - changing current between two pseudoscalar mesons is described by two form factors : @xmath98 comparing the above two equations , we find that @xmath99 thus , the heavy - quark flavour symmetry relates two a priori independent form factors to one and the same function",
    ". moreover , the normalization of the isgur  wise function at @xmath94 now implies a non - trivial normalization of the form factors @xmath100 at the point of maximum momentum transfer , @xmath101 : @xmath102    the heavy - quark spin symmetry leads to additional relations among weak decay form factors . it can be used to relate matrix elements involving vector mesons to those involving pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "a vector meson with longitudinal polarization is related to a pseudoscalar meson by a rotation of the heavy - quark spin .",
    "hence , the spin - symmetry transformation @xmath103 relates @xmath104 with @xmath105 transitions .",

    "thus , a second step is required to obtain a local effective lagrangian : the non - local effective action is rewritten as an infinite series of local terms in an operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite . roughly speaking , this corresponds to an expansion in powers of @xmath176 .",
    "it is in this step that the short- and long - distance physics is disentangled .",

    "it can be shown that the various parameters that depend on the definition of @xmath9 enter the predictions for all physical observables in such a way that the results are independent of which particular choice one adopts  @xcite .",
    "there is one more subtlety hidden in the above discussion .",

    "its matrix elements are free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "still , these matrix elements have a logarithmic dependence on @xmath9 from the exchange of hard gluons with virtual momenta of the order of the heavy - quark mass .",

    "these corrections have to be added to the matrix elements of the effective theory , which contain the long - distance physics below the scale @xmath179 .",

    "below , we shall first explain these steps in general and then illustrate them with the particular example of @xmath280 .",
    "similar to the fields and coupling constants , in a quantum field theory any composite operator built from quark and gluon fields may require a renormalization beyond that of its component fields .",
    "such operators can be divided into three classes : gauge - invariant operators that do not vanish by the equations of motion ( class - i ) , gauge - invariant operators that vanish by the equations of motion ( class - ii ) , and operators which are not gauge - invariant ( class - iii ) . in general , operators with the same dimension and quantum numbers mix under renormalization .",
    "however , things simplify if one works with the background field technique  @xcite@xmath8@xcite , which is an elegant method for quantizing gauge theories , preserving explicit gauge invariance .",
    "this offers the advantage that a class - i operator can not mix with class - iii operators , so that only gauge - invariant operators need to be considered  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , class - ii operators are irrelevant since their matrix elements vanish by the equations of motion .",
    "it it thus sufficient to consider class - i operators only .",

    "once we have found a complete basis of class - i operators , our next goal is to calculate their coefficient functions in perturbation theory .      the wilson coefficient functions @xmath287 and @xmath288 in ( [ l5 ] ) can be obtained from the comparison ( `` matching '' ) of green s functions in qcd with those in the effective theory .",
    "it is crucial that , by construction , the wilson coefficients receive only short - distance contributions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : magic ] ) and are thus insensitive to the properties of the external states .",
    "this ensures that once the coefficients have been determined by requiring that some particular green s function(s ) be the same in the two theories , all other green s functions will be the same .",
    "moreover , since the wilson coefficients are infrared insensitive they are calculable in perturbation theory , and we can perform their calculation using quark and gluon states rather than physical hadron states .    in the example at hand , the coefficients @xmath287 and @xmath289 can be obtained from a calculation of the green s function of two heavy quarks and a background gluon field , to one - loop order in the full and in the effective theory .",

    "they contain both abelian and non - abelian vertices .",
    "since the matching calculation is insensitive to any long - distance properties such as the nature of the infrared regulator , it is legitimate to work with any infrared regularization scheme that is convenient .",
    "following eichten and hill  @xcite , we choose to regulate both ultraviolet and infrared divergences using dimensional regularization .",
    "moreover , we expand the resulting expressions for the feynman amplitudes to linear order in the external momenta and then set the external momenta to zero inside the loop integrals .",

    "now comes a clue : if dimensional regularization is used to regulate both ultraviolet and infrared singularities , all loop integrals in the hqet are no - scale integrals ( after a power of the external momenta has been factored out ) and vanish !",
    "so only the tree - level matrix elements of the hqet operators in the effective lagrangian multiplied by their wilson coefficient functions remain .",

    "we find : @xmath308      the one - loop calculation presented above allows us to derive expressions for the wilson coefficient functions provided that @xmath309 . in practical applications of effective field theories ,",
    "one is however often interested in the case where there is a large ratio of mass scales .",
    "after all , an effective theory is constructed to separate the physics on two very different energy scales .",
    "in such a situation , the coefficient functions contain large logarithms of the type @xmath310^n$ ] , which must be summed to all orders in perturbation theory .",
