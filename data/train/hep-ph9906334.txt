    "for @xmath0 centre - of - mass ( cm ) collision energies above the @xmath1 pole , @xmath10 , an important contribution to the cross section for @xmath11  jets comes from the so - called `` photonic returns to the @xmath1 '' , i.e events in which one or more photons are emitted by the colliding electron - positron beams prior to the annihilation of the latter into the virtual @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "such emission can carry away a large fraction of the collider energy , so that the amount left over for the effective @xmath0 interaction , @xmath12 , can resonate at @xmath13 , well below the nominal value of @xmath14",
    ". furthermore , such initial state radiation ( isr ) is dominantly collinear to the beam direction , and so many of the photons are in practice not seen by the detectors . at lep2 , with @xmath15 gev , hadronic events in which @xmath16 have indeed been observed and in fact , because of the resonant shape of the @xmath0 cross section in the vicinity of the @xmath1 pole , they constitute a large fraction ( about one quarter ) of the total @xmath0 production rate .",
    "if one wants to study `` genuine '' physics at the lep2 collision energy scale one has to remove such events from the analysis .",
    "this is also a concern for a future electron - positron linear collider ( nlc ) , where the effect of isr is a subject of ongoing study @xcite .",
    "there is another interesting way to return the collider cm energy to the vicinity of @xmath17 in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "it proceeds via strong ( qcd ) rather than electromagnetic ( em ) interactions .",
    "the mechanism is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg]a . the virtual @xmath1 ( or photon )",
    "fluctuates into a quark - antiquark loop from which two energetic gluons are emitted .",
    "note that the box diagrams are the only ones that contribute at this leading @xmath18 order .",
    "triangle diagrams in which the two external gluons are produced via a triple - gluon vertex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg]b ) are identically zero by colour conservation , and triangle diagrams involving a @xmath19 splitting into a pair of on - shell gluons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg]c ) are forbidden by the landau - yang s theorem .",
    "thus the emission of two gluons from an internal quark loop allows for a reduction of the incoming @xmath14 energy of the @xmath19 current into a smaller outgoing energy @xmath12 of order @xmath17 , such that an on - shell neutral electroweak ( ew ) gauge boson can indeed materialise .",
    "we may therefore call such events `` hadronic returns to the @xmath1 '' , or hr for short .    at first sight",
    ", the hr cross section would appear to be heavily suppressed compared to the standard em return .",
    "for example , counting powers of coupling constants in the matrix elements squared shows that the former is of order @xmath20 whereas the latter is of order @xmath21 only .",
    "hr events should therefore be a factor of order @xmath22 less frequent than photonic return events .",
    "nevertheless it is worth investigating whether the hr events are observable at all at lep2 and/or nlc . if one continues the simple exercise of coupling counting and multiplies the @xmath0 production cross section at the @xmath1 peak , which is of order @xmath23 , times @xmath24 , one obtains an estimate for the hr cross section of the order of a few events per hundred inverse picobarn of luminosity at either machine .",
    "since the typical luminosity sample expected at the end of the lep2 running period is at least of this order of magnitude , hr events may well be already observable .",
    "for the nlc , the figure currently foreseen for the yearly luminosity is of the order of 100  fb@xmath25 , which could correspond to hundreds of hr events .",
    "furthermore , the kinematics of hr events is rather peculiar . as no infrared singularities exist in the loop tensor associated with the double gluon emission ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) , one expects a clear `` @xmath26jet '' signal , with the two gluon jets being energetic and quite randomly distributed in the relative angle .",
    "jet invariant mass distribution should be broad , without the low - mass peaking associated with @xmath27 for example . in this respect ,",
    "the hr events could be a sizeable background for processes like @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the latter when the @xmath1 and @xmath30 masses are degenerate . in both cases ,",
    "all jets are naturally energetic and well separated .",
    "furthermore , in the second example , the resonant @xmath31 pair in @xmath32 events is furnished by the decaying gauge boson , mimicking @xmath33 .",
    "of course hr is not the only source of @xmath26jet events in the standard model .",
    "the main background ( assuming that the @xmath1 is clearly identified , for example via its leptonic decays ) comes from the @xmath34 @xmath35 process .",
    "but here the jet  jet mass distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath36 and also , if kinematics allow , at @xmath17 .",
    "a quantitative comparison with hr events will be presented below .",
    "if the @xmath1 boson in hr events decays to two jets , there is of course a large background from standard qcd and ew @xmath37 processes @xcite .",
    "however the topology of such events is in general very different from the hr one , as we shall see .",
    "the discussion so far has been at the level of coupling constants and general kinematics . that , however , is only part of the story . to quantify the above effects one must calculate the appropriate one - loop feynman diagrams .",
    "in fact , it is very difficult to make any _ a priori _ statements regarding the loop dynamics . although the expression for the tensor box entering in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg]a , with two massive and two massless external legs , has been known for a long time @xcite those results can not be used for the hr cross section calculation here .",
    "this is due to the presence of a _ gram determinant _ that causes problems with numerical stability when the matrix elements are interfaced with the @xmath38 phase space .",
    "this will be discussed further below .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec_calculation ]",
    "we outline how the calculation is performed and make use of the results in order to assess whether hadronic returns induced by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg]a can be of any relevance at all in phenomenological analyses at present and/or future electron - positron colliders .",
    "the results presented in section  [ sec_results ] will help answer this question . in section  [ sec_conclusions ]",
    "we will summarise the main findings of our studies .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the fourth - rank tensor that enters the amplitude squared for @xmath39 associated with the ( six ) diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg]a requires special attention in order to resolve problems with its numerical stability .    as with all calculations at one - loop order ,",
    "explicit analytic formulae contain determinants in the denominator of the expressions .",
    "these determinants can be thought of as arising from the inversion of a set of simultaneous equations , and can be , in general , complicated polynomials of the invariants of the problem .",
    "furthermore , these determinants are raised to a power of up to the rank of the tensor ( i.e. in our case , four ) .",
    "clearly , any analytic expression will be numerically unstable close to the point in phase space where this determinant vanishes .",
    "this is the gram determinant stability problem  @xcite .    in most previous calculations involving triangle and box diagrams this was not significant because the gram determinant vanished only at the edge of phase space , where the matrix elements diverged anyway due to soft and/or collinear singularities .",
    "indeed this is the case in refs .",
    "@xcite where the box diagrams were only required for @xmath40 processes , ensuring that the determinant singularity was safely stowed away at the edge of phase space .",
    "however , when one considers the same box integral for @xmath38 processes , as we must do here , the gram determinant singularity now falls in the centre of our phase space and can not be ignored .",
    "it should be emphasised that this is a purely technical , rather then a conceptual , problem",
    ". there is , in actuality , no physical divergence when the gram determinant vanishes .",
    "it is , in fact , merely an artifact of the way in which the calculation was performed , where the expression is written in a form which makes a _ fake _ divergence apparent .",
    "that is , it should be possible to overcome the gram determinant problem by either performing the numerical integration at a sufficiently high accuracy or by analytically cancelling by hand divergent terms in the expression to render the matrix elements manifestly finite .",
    "however , in the tensor integral of refs .",
    "@xcite , the gram determinant in the denominator is raised to the fourth power , giving a divergence which is too powerful to overcome even at quadruple precision . using this tensor for",
    "the @xmath38 process one would obtain wildly inaccurate results which could not be trusted .",
    "instead one must adopt the second approach and write the matrix elements in a manifestly finite form .",
    "this is not as easy as it sounds .",
    "the one - loop matrix elements are extremely complicated and lengthy , containing logarithms , dilogarithms and polynomials of the invariants .",
    "it is virtually impossible to find and cancel the divergent terms in such an expression .",
    "instead , we take the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , and recalculate the tensor box integral in such a way that these fake gram determinant singularities are controlled _ from the beginning_. in this way we have recalculated the tensor box integral such that it is manifestly finite over all phase space and can be used for @xmath38 processes without any problems of stability .",
    "this method also leads to more compact expressions ( although still too lengthy to be reproduced here ) .",
    "the newly calculated tensor is then interfaced with the incoming @xmath41 off - shell current and the outgoing polarisation vectors for the gluons and the gauge boson . in some cases we have kept the latter off - shell , also allowing for contemporaneous @xmath42 and @xmath43 production followed by the decays @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath37 matrix elements ( mes ) obtained this way have been integrated numerically over the appropriate three- and four - body phase spaces .",
    "because of delicate cancellations taking place among the diagrams , it is however important to verify the stability of the results against different mappings of the latter .",
    "to do so we have implemented the kinematics of the final states both analytically , using different integration variables ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for some possible choices ) , and numerically using the multi - particle phase space generator rambo @xcite .",
    "furthermore , different routines have been used for the numerical integration , namely the monte carlo package vegas @xcite and the naglib routines d01eaf and d01gcf .",
    "we have found agreement within the numerical errors for all the resulting outputs .",
    "an optimised version of the program designed for high statistics monte carlo simulations is available upon request from the authors .",
    "the numerical values for the electroweak and strong parameters used in the numerical calculations presented below are as follows : @xmath46 , @xmath47  gev , @xmath48  gev , @xmath49  gev , @xmath50  gev , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is computed at two - loop , with five active flavours and at a renormalisation scale equal to the cm energy .",
    "all fermion ( i.e. lepton and five quark ) masses are set equal to zero .",
    "as representative of lep2 and nlc we have considered cm energies in the range 130  gev @xmath53 500  gev .",
    "given the value of the top mass , i.e. @xmath54 gev , and the presence of four top propagators in the box diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg]a , the contribution of the top loop to the overall hr cross section is negligible , both at lep2 and nlc , and so we do not include it here for simplicity at lhc @xcite .",
    "in addition , a non - zero mass in the loop leads to a large proliferation of terms in the tensor reduction , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "we start our investigation of the hadronic returns to the @xmath1 by studying the production cross section of the process @xmath39 as a function of @xmath55 , between typical lep2 and nlc energies . in order to observe the two gluons as separate jets , one ought to impose some isolation criteria on them . to this end",
    ", we simply adopt a jet clustering algorithm @xcite : for example , the durham algorithm @xcite , with resolution @xmath56 .",
    "( note however that none of the main features of our analysis depends upon either the choice of the jet algorithm or of its resolution parameter . ) the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_scan ] reports the production rates with such a di - jet selection enforced .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig_scan ] that @xmath57 is very small .",
    "the maximum value occurs at @xmath58 gev , and this is of the order of 0.012 fb only . for typical lep2 energies",
    ", it is always smaller than 0.010  fb , well below detection level .",
    "in fact , at least 100 inverse femtobarns of lep2 luminosity would need to be collected to observe just one such event , a figure which is well beyond the current machine potential . at the nlc , running at around the top - antitop threshold , i.e. with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 gev , the production rate is slightly above 0.010 fb . for 100 fb@xmath25 per year , a handful of @xmath39 events would be produced at the end of the collider lifetime at such energy ( say , of about five years ) . at an nlc running at 500  gev",
    "the rates fall back to the values typical of lep2 .",
    "however , the order of magnitude of yearly luminosity of a linear collider running with @xmath61 is expected to be not much different from the corresponding value at threshold .",
    "thus some hr events would eventually show up also at an nlc running at high energy .",
    "figure  [ fig_scan ] also shows the cross section for the @xmath34 @xmath35 process .",
    "this is _ much _ larger than the hr cross section , but the kinematics are very different .",
    "in fact at cm energies greater than about @xmath62 the @xmath63 cross section is completely dominated by the on - shell @xmath64 contribution , corresponding to final states with @xmath65 .",
    "we shall return to this below when we consider kinematic distributions at a typical nlc energy .",
    "the hr cross section values in fig .",
    "[ fig_scan ] seem to contradict the speculations made in the introduction , where we had argued in terms of couplings and kinematics about the possible production rate of @xmath39 events .",
    "in fact our original ( optimistic ) arguments there are spoiled by the loop behaviour  the far - off - shell internal propagators are an important additional source of suppression . to understand this further we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_mqq ] the cross section for @xmath66 , i.e. for the production of an off - shell photon of virtuality @xmath67 , as a function of the latter . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we consider a cm energy of 172  gev .",
    "notice how the cross section decreases by almost two orders of magnitude going from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "our arguments about the size of the cross section based on counting powers of the coupling did not take this @xmath70 dependence into account , and in fact they turn out to be relevant for the small @xmath70 limit only .",
    "the decrease of available phase space as @xmath70 increases is another important factor at this energy .",
    "having understood the origin of the overall size of the production cross section for @xmath39 , we turn to some typical kinematic distributions of such events at the nlc .",
    "the typical energies ( momenta ) of the two gluons can be seen in the left - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg1 ] , whereas in the right - hand plot of the same figure we show the distribution in the momentum of the @xmath1-boson . in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg2 ] , we show instead the invariant mass of the two gluons ( upper plot ) , together with the angular separation between them ( lower plot ) .",
    "the distributions shown in these two figures agree remarkably well with the behaviour anticipated in sect .",
    "[ sec_intro ] .",
    "that is , the two gluons are produced with large energy and with no tendency to be emitted in the same direction ( associated with the absence of soft and collinear singularities in the me ) .",
    "indeed , in many events the gluons are approximately back - to - back ( see lower plot of fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig_zgg2 ] also shows the invariant mass and angular distributions for the @xmath63 process .",
    "as anticipated , the former contains a sharp breit - wigner peak at @xmath65 which is responsible for the bulk of the cross section .",
    "the same kinematics are also responsible for the jets being produced at a relative angle of about @xmath71 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig_zgg1][fig_zgg2 ] the default value of 0.001 was used for the resolution parameter @xmath72 of the durham jet algorithm .",
    "however , given the definition of the separation @xmath73 which has to be compared to @xmath72 , in terms of the energies @xmath74 and @xmath75 and relative angle @xmath76 for each pair of particles @xmath77 ( here , the @xmath78 pair only ) , the kinematics described above imply that there is in fact very little dependence of @xmath57 on the actual value of @xmath72 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg3 ] .",
    "if one increases the cut - off by , say , a factor of ten from the default value ( 0.001 ) , approximately @xmath79 more events are rejected .",
    "so far we have only considered the case of _ on - shell _ @xmath1 boson production . in other words ,",
    "the rates given so far correspond to what one would obtain by adding together all possible @xmath1 decay channels .",
    "the dominant among these is of course the decay into @xmath80 pairs ( with a branching ratio of about @xmath81 ) , so that the most frequent hr signature is four - jet final states .",
    "these are described by the same diagrams as in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg]a , simply supplemented with an additional @xmath82 decay current . in the four - jet channel , now selected by applying the durham algorithm with cut - off @xmath56 to all _ four _ partons in the final state , one obtains the typical cross sections of tab .  [ tab_xsections ] .",
    "( note that we have also included the @xmath83 propagator in the @xmath37 hr matrix element . ) as already emphasised , the lep2 four - jet rates are well below detection level . in contrast , the nlc cross sections would still be detectable in the four - jet channel after a few year of running at the level of 100 inverse femtobarns .",
    "however , a more interesting phenomenology could arise from the hadronic returns in the four - jet channel when they manifest themselves in interference processes .",
    "in fact , the @xmath84 final state can also be produced at tree - level by the @xmath85 diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig_tree ] .",
    "these interfere with those in fig .",
    "[ fig_loop]a .",
    "this interference could allow for a more significant effect than the square of the hr amplitudes , possibly even at lep2 energies , where the qcd process of fig .",
    "[ fig_tree ] is the dominant component of the total four - jet rate ( even larger than @xmath86 at small values of @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , one should notice that the interference between the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_tree ] and  [ fig_loop]a is not the only one occurring at this order of the couplings .",
    "in fact , one also has to consider the interference between the tree - level graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig_tree ] and those in fig .",
    "[ fig_loop]b , the latter being nothing more than the former supplemented with the @xmath19 self - energy at one - loop ( and calculated assuming @xmath87 for the renormalisation scale ) .",
    "the contributions of these two terms at lep2 is presented in the upper part of tab .",
    "[ tab_int ] , alongside the leading term given by the square of the tree - level diagrams . for reference",
    ", we have set the cm energy equal to 183  gev .",
    "the cross sections are calculated for two illustrative values of @xmath72 in the four - jet regime . from tab .",
    "[ tab_int ] it can be seen that the interference involving the hr amplitudes is positive and very small , but still an order of magnitude larger than the square of the latter ( see tab .  [ tab_xsections ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the interference involving the self - energy diagrams is negative and sizeable , of the order of @xmath88 of the leading term . from these numbers ,",
    "we conclude that hr effects are unobservable in practice at lep2 even in interference processes , . on the one hand ,",
    "their production rate is tiny _ per se _ , and on the other hand the other four - jet contributions ( including the qcd @xcite and ew @xcite four - quark @xmath89 components and their interference @xcite ) are much larger .",
    "in addition the situation is not improved by the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to @xmath90 and @xmath89 @xcite , which give rise to a @xmath91-factor of order 1.5 @xcite !    taking a more optimistic view , we can conclude that at lep2 hadronic returns do not constitute a serious background to the important physics measurements performed with the four - jet channel .",
    "for example , the @xmath92four jet process is used to measure @xmath93 .",
    "four - jet events can also be generated by the elusive higgs boson produced in association with a @xmath1 , via @xmath94 ( where the second quark pair is dominantly @xmath95 ) . had the hr interference effects been sizeable , it would have been a potentially serious background .",
    "in fact , by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig_m4j ] one realises that not only the @xmath80 invariant mass induced by the diagrams of fig .  [ fig_loop]a resonates at @xmath17  gev a detectable higgs would have a mass @xmath96 approximately degenerate with that of the @xmath1 boson . ] but also the @xmath97 ( or , equivalently , @xmath98 ) mass has a ( negative ) jacobian peak around @xmath93 ! in contrast , the @xmath78 distribution ( lower plot ) would have been of little concern in this respect .",
    "the behaviour of the other two four - jet mechanisms discussed is driven by the infrared nature of the qcd interactions ( small invariant masses preferred ) and by the constraints enforced through the jet - finder , with the self - energy contributions being naturally proportional to the tree - level ones .",
    "notice also that at an nlc with @xmath99  gev ( see lower part of tab .",
    "[ tab_int ] ) hadronic returns do not enter the observable four - jet sample via interference effects .",
    "in fact , the corresponding rates are smaller in magnitude than those produced by the hr amplitudes on their own ( see tab .",
    "[ tab_xsections ] ) , in contrast to the situation at lep2 . the sign is also reversed ",
    "the @xmath100 contributions are positive in the latter case , and negative in the former .",
    "finally , for reference , fig .",
    "[ fig_square ] shows the same three mass distributions discussed in the previous plots but now for the square of the hr matrix element , i.e. @xmath101",
    ". we again take @xmath102  gev and @xmath56 in the durham algorithm . for comparison ,",
    "we also present in fig .",
    "[ fig_square ] the invariant mass of the @xmath80 , @xmath103 ( or , equivalently , @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 pairs produced in the final state of the higgs process , when @xmath106 .",
    "note the overlap of the degenerate higgs and @xmath1 boson mass peaks in the top frame , the latter also appearing in the bottom one ( though cut off at the upper edge by phase space constraints on the @xmath107 process ) well above the spectrum generated by the squared diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig_loop]a .",
    "the two distributions in the central frame look rather similar . for the @xmath101 contributions at the nlc ( which we do not reproduce here ) , the @xmath108 spectrum is basically the same as that given in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgg2 ] , the @xmath109 one is again a breit - wigner centred around @xmath17 ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig_square ] ) , whereas the @xmath110 one has a jacobian shape extending to values somewhat higher than those in fig .",
    "[ fig_square ] , having its maximum at about 100  gev .",
    "we have studied in this paper the effects of what we have called `` hadronic returns to the @xmath1 '' in high - energy @xmath0 annihilation . these correspond to diagrams in which a primary @xmath19 current originates a quark loop from which two gluons are emitted in association with a @xmath1 boson , the former being energetic enough so that the the latter is near its mass - shell .",
    "these are a novel source of two - lepton @xmath111 two - jet and four - jet events which could , _ a priori _ , constitute a problematic background for @xmath112 and @xmath113 studies at lep2 and nlc .",
    "naive power counting arguments suggest that the rates could indeed be non - negligible .",
    "as there is no substitute for a realistic analysis , we have performed a full matrix element calculation , which has enabled us to compare the hr cross sections with those of the standard processes .",
    "we first calculated the hadronic returns as a process on its own , by integrating the amplitude squared of the relevant perturbative graphs , as well as the interference of these with the tree - level diagrams for quark - antiquark - two - gluon production , corresponding to the case where the @xmath1 boson decays into a quark pair .    in every channel studied , the effects of the hr contributions are completely negligible at lep2 . in contrast , at an nlc with energy between 350 and 500  gev , they can be observed at a rate of a few per 100 inverse femtobarns for various @xmath1 decay signatures , whereas their interference with the tree - level contribution to the total four - jet rate is negligible also at the nlc .",
    "thus , the hr contributions are significant enough at such a collider to merit attention when proceeding to experimental studies of high luminosity data samples .",
