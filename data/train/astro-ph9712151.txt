    "a substantial population of young radio sources is expected , given the expansion of radio sources and the short - lived nature of radio emission ( alexander & leahy 1987 ) .",
    "this rle may be filled by a class of intrinsically small objects , compact , steep - spectrum ( css ) sources ( as a guide , @xmath1 kpc and @xmath2 for @xmath3 ) .",
    "evidence that some css sources are indeed young is mounting ( readhead et al . 1996 ) , although the class may also include frustrated sources whose jets are constricted by an unusually dense and/or clumpy interstellar medium ( ism ) .    the small size of css sources means that radio observations probe the dense nuclear environment of the host galaxies .",
    "absorption by hi gas , perhaps from a dense parsec - scale disk , has been reported towards the compact radio components of several css sources ( conway 1996 ) .",
    "radio depolarisation is also common ( garrington et al .",
    "evidence for jet - ism interactions in css sources is strong , including bent , knotty jets and aligned optical emission ( de vries et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "evidence that css sources differ optically from larger sources , however , is only now emerging .",
    "new differences have been found for css quasars , including very red optical continua , large balmer decrements and large narrow - line equivalent widths which are suggestive of reddening ( baker & hunstead 1995 ) .",
    "one particularly interesting characteristic is that associated absorption by enriched hi gas is exceptionally common in css quasars ( baker & hunstead 1996 ) . in a recent study of the complete molonglo quasar sample ( mqs ) absorption with",
    "was found in 80% of css quasars with @xmath4 , where  and/or  was visible .    in this short contribution",
    ", i will show that css quasars share many similarities with high - redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) , and are arguably instrinsically similar objects .",
    "this is based largely on the results of intermediate resolution spectroscopy ( with r. hunstead ) of   absorbers towards high - redshift css quasars from the mqs .",
    "spectroscopy at 1-  resolution has been carried out for seven high-@xmath5 css quasars drawn from the 408-mhz selected mqs ( baker 1997 ) with the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "the ly-@xmath0 emission - line region has been observed for three css quasars with @xmath6 .",
    "these targets were faint ( @xmath7 on the ukst iiiaj plates ) and required long integration times of several hours per object at this high dispersion .    in all three quasars , strong ly-@xmath0 absorption is seen within 2000  of the quasar redshift .",
    "the ly-@xmath0 absorption lines are strong but not damped , making estimates of the column density uncertain .",
    "typical column densities of @xmath8@xmath9 are indicated along the line of sight .",
    "dust is undoubtedly present as well , which may have increased the ly-@xmath0 optical depth via scattering .",
    "the ly-@xmath0 absorption lines are both blue- and red - shifted with respect to the ly-@xmath0 emission - line peak , and appear broadened with fwhms of 100400 .",
    "blue - shifted absorption systems are most common , perhaps indicating outflowing clouds from the nucleus .",
    "the presence of at least one redshifted absorption system relative to the quasar emission redshift , and the broadened lines , favours an intrinsic origin for the absorbing material rather than absorption by intervening galaxies .    over",
    "the wavelength range observed , many other species are visible , ranging from nv to oi .",
    "the variety of species present indicates that the absorbing clouds span a range of density and ionisation .",
    "one quasar shows high - ionisation lines ( nv and siiii ) along with  in the same system , another quasar both high- and low - ionisation species ( siii , oi , cii ) . in the third spectrum ,",
    "the ly-@xmath0 system lying closest to the quasar redshift contains no obvious metal lines , but a second absorption system containing  as well as strong low ionisation lines is present 5000  to the blue of the quasar redshift .",
    "figure [ q0246 ] shows an example of a spectrum of a css quasar at @xmath10 , mqs0246@xmath11231 .",
    "this quasar is very faint  @xmath12 on the ukst iiiaj plates .",
    "strong ly-@xmath0 absorption is clearly seen along with the high - ionisation absorption lines of nv and siiii , which are marked .",
    "there is a slight redshift mis - match between , nv and siiii , which probably indicates that the ly-@xmath0 absorption arises in spatially distinct regions .",
    "all four absorption lines are clearly resolved , indicating a relatively large velocity dispersion for the clouds ( up to 400 ) .",
    "the ly-@xmath0 emission - line profile in this quasar is relatively narrow ( 1000  fwhm ) , a width more typical of radio galaxies .",
    "the strong ly-@xmath0 absorption found towards css quasars is very similar to that reported towards a number of high - redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) ( e.g. van ojik et al .",
    "1997 ) . in hzrgs , the absorbers are probably related to extended kpc - scale  emission regions , which indicate that reservoirs of hi gas envelope the radio source . the ly-@xmath0 absorbers in hzrgs are observed to cover the entire area of extended ly-@xmath0 emission , reaching tens of kpc from the nucleus",
    "the absorbers in hzrgs are also metal - enriched  species including civ and siiii accompany the ly-@xmath0 absorption . in hzrgs ,",
    "ly-@xmath0 absorption occurs preferentially towards sources of small linear size ( van ojik et al .",
    "1997 ) and with bent radio structures ( barthel & miley 1988 ) , suggesting a link between absorption and radio source size and also direct interactions between the hi halo and the radio jets .",
    "in fact many of the above characteristics of hzrgs are shared with css sources , raising the possibility that hzrgs and css sources are intrinsically similar objects .    in figure [ two ] , the 1-  resolution ly-@xmath0 spectrum of a hzrg at @xmath13 , mrc0943@xmath11242 ( rttgering et al .",
    "1995 ) , has been scaled and plotted on top of  for the css quasar mqs0246@xmath11231 ( from figure [ q0246 ] ) .",
    "the similarities in the ly-@xmath0 absorption and emission properties are striking .",
    "the only obvious difference between the two is the presence of continuum emission in the quasar .",
    "this example strongly supports the idea that many hzrgs are in fact misaligned css quasars with their continuum and broad - line regions hidden by a dusty torus .",
    "such a picture is entirely consistent with the inference of hidden quasars in hzrgs through spectropolarimetry ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "1997 ) and the presence of continuum and emission - line light aligned with the radio axis in many hzrgs ( e.g. rush et al .",
    "by noting the similarities between hzrgs and css quasars , the properties of intrinsically small radio sources can begin to be unified .",
    "this spectroscopic study shows that some of the properties of hzrgs are in fact common characteristics of small radio sources , including many css sources .",
    "whether these properties are a consequence of youth remains to be confirmed  some fraction of older , frustrated sources is still expected .",
    "the similarities between hzrgs and css quasars places even more emphasis on the study of css sources over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "the presence of ly-@xmath0 absorption with  preferentially in sources of small linear size suggests that the absorption properties of quasars are linked directly to the evolution of the radio source .",
    "it can be postulated that radio sources are born in cocoons of enriched hi gas which is ionised and pushed aside as the radio source grows .",
    "this explains the lower rate of  absorption in larger sources .",
    "the origin of the hi cocoons , however , and their possible rle in triggering radio emission in active galaxies , remains unknown .",
    "remnants of past galaxy mergers and reservoirs of primordial gas have both been postulated as explanations for the ly-@xmath0 haloes around hzrgs .",
    "associated ( ) ly-@xmath0 absorption is common in css quasars",
    ". the absorbers may be metal enriched , and span a range of density and ionisation .",
    "the properties of these ly-@xmath0 absorbers appear identical to those seen towards hzrgs , especially ones of small linear size . on the basis of their similar hi environments ,",
    "as probed by absorption , and other evidence , it is likely that many hzrgs and css quasars are intrinsically similar objects .",
    "the properties of small radio sources are crucial for investigating the processes which drive radio source evolution .",
    "associated absorption in particular appears to offer a new way of probing possible intrinsic differences between large and small radio sources ."
