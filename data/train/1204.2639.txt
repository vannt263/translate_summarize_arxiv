    "in the present paper , we use the theory of functions of noncommuting operators @xcite , aka noncommutative analysis ( which can be viewed as a far - reaching generalization of pseudodifferential operator calculus ) , to solve an asymptotic problem for a partial differential equation and show how , starting from general constructions and operator formulas that seem to be rather abstract from the viewpoint of differential equations , one can end up with very specific , easy - to - evaluate expressions for the solution , useful , e.g. , in the tsunami wave problem .",
    "we consider the cauchy problem with zero initial data for a 2d wave equation with variable velocity and with right - hand side localized near the origin in space and decaying in time .",
    "one physical interpretation of this problem is that it describes , in the linear approximation , the propagation of tsunami waves generated by local vertical displacements of the ocean bottom ( see @xcite and also @xcite and the bibliography therein ) .",
    "normally , the diameter of the region where these displacements occur ( some tens to a hundred of kilometers ) is much smaller than the distance traveled by the waves ( thousands of kilometers ) , and their ratio , @xmath0 , can serve as a small parameter .",
    "accordingly , we are interested in the asymptotics of the solution as @xmath1 . in the simplest _ piston model _ of tsunami generation ,",
    "the bottom displacement occurs instantaneously at @xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to a right - hand side of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dirac delta function , and the problem is immediately equivalent , via duhamel s principle , to the cauchy problem for the homogeneous wave equation with initial data @xmath5 for the unknown function itself and zero initial data for its @xmath6-derivative .",
    "fairly explicit asymptotic solution formulas suitable for easy implementation in _ wolfram mathematica _",
    "@xcite were constructed and analyzed for the latter problem in @xcite on the basis of a generalization of maslov s canonical operator @xcite .",
    "now assume we wish to take into account the fact that the ocean bottom displacement evolves in time rather than happens instantaneously .",
    "then it is natural to consider a right - hand side of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some smooth approximation to the delta function .",
    "an analysis shows that the solution can be represented as the sum of two parts , a propagating part , which travels along the characteristics , and a transient part , which is localized in the vicinity of the origin and decays in time .",
    "the propagating part can further be represented as the solution of the cauchy problem for the homogeneous wave equation with initial data obtained from @xmath5 by application of certain functions @xmath9 of the spatial part @xmath10 of the wave operator , where the corresponding symbols @xmath11 are given by simple formulas expressing them via the fourier transform of @xmath8 .",
    "these initial data , also localized near the origin , will be referred to as the _ equivalent source functions_. the transient part of the solution is given by a formula similar to those for the equivalent source functions with the only difference that the function @xmath11 additionally depends on time as a parameter .",
    "the transient part is apparently not so important in tsunami wave analysis , but nevertheless it might be useful from the viewpoint of satellite registration of tsunami waves @xcite .",
    "since , as was mentioned above , the asymptotic formulas for the solution of the cauchy problem with localized initial data for the homogeneous wave equation are already known from @xcite , we see that the only remaining thing is to compute @xmath12 for all these functions",
    "it is here that noncommutative analysis comes fully into play .",
    "note that @xmath10 is an operator with variable coefficients , and so computing the function @xmath9 efficiently may prove quite a challenging task .",
    "however , all we actually need is the asymptotics of @xmath12 , and methods of noncommutative analysis permit one to prove that @xmath13 plus an asymptotically small remainder , where @xmath14 is obtained from @xmath10 by freezing the coefficients at the origin . now computing @xmath15 is a breeze , because @xmath16 is conjugate by the fourier",
    "transform to the operator of multiplication by the function @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the symbol of  @xmath14 .",
    "the one - dimensional counterpart of the problem studied in the present paper was considered in  @xcite . in the two - dimensional case",
    ", the results were announced in  @xcite , where the proofs were partly only sketched and partly absent altogether . here",
    "we develop and refine these results and give complete proofs .",
    "finally , note that we deal with the setting in which the wave propagation velocity is assumed to vanish nowhere .",
    "the case it which it vanishes ( as it happens on the coastline in the tsunami run - up problem ) is much more complicated .",
    "the asymptotics of solutions of such degenerate problems in some special cases was considered in the spirit of the approach of @xcite in @xcite ( see also references therein ) ; in the present paper , we restrict ourselves to wave propagation in open ocean .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] , we give a detailed statement of the mathematical problem and write out well - known formulas expressing the solution in operator form . using these formulas , we split the solution into the sum of the propagating and transient parts .",

    "speaking in terms of the physical interpretation given in the introduction , let us explain the meaning of the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath0 and condition  .",

    "this has a very clear meaning : the waves excited by the perturbation can not travel too far before the perturbation dies out ; they only cover a distance @xmath52 of the same order of magnitude as the diameter @xmath46 of the perturbation region .",
    "we introduce the ratio @xmath53 so that condition   ( and hence ) becomes @xmath54 mathematically , condition   means that the parameter @xmath39 is large ( at least of the order of @xmath55 ) as @xmath1 .",
    "note that , in view of the first two conditions in  , @xmath56 and @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "in what follows , the dependence on the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath0 is sometimes not immediately important to the argument , and in such cases we often `` hide '' these parameters by using the notation @xmath59    next , let us give specific examples of right - hand sides @xmath41 . in practice ,",
    "the actual ocean bottom displacement is known neither in much detail nor very precisely , because the corresponding measurements are impractical or impossible ( cf .",
    "this results in certain freedom , which can be turned into an advantage .",
    "namely , when constructing the function @xmath60 to be used in the analytical - numerical simulation according to the model  , one should take ansatzes that , on the one hand , fit the general information available about the source shape and evolution and , on the other hand , can be handled efficiently in the computations .",
    "( the latter includes the requirement that these functions , as well as their fourier transforms , be given by closed - form expressions , which permits one to reduce the amount of numerical computations in favor of the less time - consuming analytical transformations . )    a useful class of functions @xmath28 satisfying   is described by the expression  @xcite , generalizing @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are real parameters .",

    "<S> in the present paper , we use the theory of functions of noncommuting operators , also known as noncommutative analysis ( which can be viewed as a far - reaching generalization of pseudodifferential operator calculus ) , to solve an asymptotic problem for a partial differential equation and show how , starting from general constructions and operator formulas that seem to be rather abstract from the viewpoint of differential equations , one can end up with very specific , easy - to - evaluate expressions for the solution , useful , e.g. , in the tsunami wave problem . </S>"
