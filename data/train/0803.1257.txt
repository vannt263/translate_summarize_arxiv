    "low - dimensional systems involving transition metals ( tm ) is the subject of an extraordinary research activity which is driven by both fundamental and technological interest .",
    "the complexity of this field is illustrated by considering that frequently the experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite works are in contradiction each other .",
    "for example , the theoretical possibility of ferromagnetism in 4@xmath2 tm thin films on noble substrates was originally reported by zhu@xcite and eriksson@xcite , then several experimental works were performed@xcite : some of those with the intention of creating@xcite that kind of systems in the laboratory and others with the idea of searching for magnetism@xcite .",
    "however , magnetism was not found experimentally .",
    "this lack of accord was regarded as a consequence of that neither relaxation nor pseudomorphism were taken into account in the theoretical models . in this sense ,",
    "wu and freeman@xcite , using a full potential method which took into consideration relaxation by means of total energy minimization , presented a comparison between magnetic and paramagnetic states as a function of the ru(rh)-ag interlayer distance . in the same direction",
    "blgel@xcite ignoring the force minimization reported the dependence of magnetism as a function of the layer coverage .",
    "afterward , turek@xcite _ et al . _",
    "using an _ ab initio _ method and making allowance for mixing with the ag atoms , obtained the magnetic moment as a function of the coverage and the mixing with the ag substrate .",
    "besides , experimental works done by chang@xcite _ et al . _ and beckmann@xcite _ et al .",
    "_ presented the possibility of clusters formation in the surface , and due to this the vanishing of magnetism . following these experimental works stepanyuk@xcite _ et al .",
    "_ studied small and mixed @xmath3 clusters on ag(001 ) surface , and in according with other theoretical works , they found magnetic moments in ru and rh atoms .",
    "much more recently , honolka@xcite _ et al .",
    "_ , using x - ray magnetic circular dichroism obtained no magnetic signal in ru and rh thin films on ag(001 ) in contradiction with theoretical works@xcite . also , chado@xcite _ et al .",
    "_ using stm images reported absence of ferromagnetism in a study of rh atoms deposited on au(111 ) substrate .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an advance in the comprehension of the subtle interplay between magnetism and geometry in ru and rh thin films on ag(001 ) .",
    "this specific problem is expected to be particularly interesting from a fundamental point of view due to the current inconsistency between theory and experiment@xcite . in particular",
    ", it seems that two out of three mean reasons for this disagreement have been ruled out .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section a brief outline of the _ ab initio",
    "_ method used for the calculations is given .",
    "the results obtained for paramagnetic state and the magnetism in ru and rh thin films on ag(001 ) fcc substrate are presented and discussed in section 3 .",

    "our model consists of various geometrical configurations divided in supported ( noted by o ) ( fig",

    "the unit cell has 4 inequivalent atoms per plane .",
    "these geometrical configurations are showed in fig . @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "also we studied 1 and 2 monolayers ( ml ) .",
    "the geometrical configurations consist of 7 metallic layers , where 5 layers correspond to ag(001 ) substrate and 1 adlayer on each side of the slab .",
    "these adlayers represent the supported , alloyed atoms and full monolayers depending of the case .",
    "the metallic layers are separated by 7 layers of empty space , which is sufficent to prevent the interaction between the slabs and to vanish the charge at the central layer of empty space .",
    "all atoms are located at the ideal positions of a ( 001 ) slab with lattice parameter of ag(001 ) ( 4.09@xmath16 ) , however we determined the atomic position using force minimization .",
    "the calculation are performed using the monkhorst - pack scheme to define the @xmath17 points for each slab with a grid of @xmath18 . a cut - off energy of 36 ryd ( 489ev )",
    "was used for the plane waves expansion of the pseudowave function ( 560ryd for the charge density and potential ) .",
    "the interlayer distances are relaxed until the absolute force is less than 0.001 ryd / a.u .",

    ", we considered two out of the three mean possible causes : relaxation and the alloying effects . however , magnetism occurred .",
    "it seems then that the origin of the discrepancy between the mentioned experiment and current theory must be sought in other causes , for example , many - body effects , spin fluctuations , steps among others .",
    "the alloying reduces the magnetic energy by a factor of 2 , and the magnetic moments per atom as well .",
    "the magnetism increases the distance between the atoms , in agreement with the magneto - bulk coupling .",
    "we have used the stoner model to reveal the magnetic order and we have found that the magnetic order is a coverage function , and that the systems have a magnetic phase transition in coverage function . for very low coverage the system is ferromagnetic , and when the coverage increases the magnetic order goes to weak ferromagnetic , superparamagnetic and finally paramagnetic , successively . by considering the surface aggregate formation and",
    "buried aggregate , we determine the difference of total energy and the ground state , in both cases is the magnetic 2d buried aggregate , and this aggregate does not satisfy the stoner criterion .",
    "the two main conclusion are : ( 1 ) the ru and rh thin films have a magnetic phase transition as a function of the coverage and ( 2 ) the 2d buried aggregate is a more stable system ."
