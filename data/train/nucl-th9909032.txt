    "modifications of hadrons properties in nuclear and hot hadronic matter is one of the central subjects of present day nuclear physics .",
    "for instance , it has been suggested in @xcite that the in - medium pion - pion interaction might be significantly reshaped at density even below normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the basic mechanism is linked to the nuclear collective pionic modes sometimes called pisobars originating from the p - wave coupling of the pion to delta - holes states . according to detailed calculation @xcite these collective modes",
    "are needed to explain charge exchange data @xcite , despite the peripheral character of these experiments .",
    "this medium effect yields a softening of the pion dispersion relation and consequently a modification of the two - pion propagator involved in the unitarized @xmath0 matrix describing pion - pion interaction at finite density .",
    "indeed , on the basis of purely phenomenological models @xcite , an important reshaping of the pion - pion interaction in the scalar - isoscalar channel ( sigma channel ) , producing a sizeable accumulation of strength near two - pion threshold , has been predicted .",
    "this problem has been reinvestigated with chiral symmetric models such as linear or non linear sigma models @xcite with special emphasis on the consistency between chiral symmetry constraints and unitarization .",
    "it has been soon realized that this medium effect is of considerable importance for the still open problem of nuclear saturation since an important part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction comes from correlated two - pion exchange and several papers have brought extremely interesting results @xcite . a possible evidence for this reshaping of the @xmath1 strength function is provided by the @xmath2 data obtained on various nuclei by the chaos collaboration at triumf @xcite .",
    "recent calculations show that the observed marked structure in the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum can be partially explained by this reshaping @xcite .",
    "these last results have been questioned in a recent paper @xcite where it is found that pion absorption forces the reaction to occur at lower peripheral density . .",
    "however , what was ignored in the previous approaches was the possible medium modification of the basic @xmath1 interaction _",
    "i. e. _ the @xmath1 potential from the underlying quark substructure or , in other words , from the in - medium modification of hadronic properties associated to chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "this may have considerable consequences since , applying by hand in the linear sigma model pion - pion potential a brown - rho scaling of the sigma mass yields a significant enhancement of the near threshold structure in the @xmath4 strength function @xcite . to go further ,",
    "it is important to construct an in - medium @xmath1 pion - pion potential this question has already been addressed @xcite in the framework of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model at finite temperature . in this paper",
    "we will first use exactly the same scheme but with a straightforward generalization at finite constituent quark density to be identified later with one third of the baryonic ( _ i.e. _ nucleonic ) density .",
    "in particular we will show that , using a slightly different prescription for the loop integrals , the njl model regenerates the linear sigma model pion - pion born term amplitude .",
    "this result , which is numerically extremely close to the more involved calculational scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , can be generalized at finite density and/or temperature provided the values of the pion mass , the sigma mass and the pion decay constant are replaced by their in - medium values calculated in the njl model . using this scheme we are in position to study in a particularly simple way direct observable consequences of both partial chiral symmetry restoration such as dropping of the sigma meson mass and collective p - wave pionic modes by looking at the in - medium pion - pion interaction in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "this is of utmost importance since , as emphasized recently by hatsuda _",
    "_ , the evolution of collective scalar - isoscalar modes , _",
    "i.e. _ the sigma meson , may reveal precursor effects associated to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .    from this density",
    "dependent effective linear sigma model potential implemented with a phenomenological form factor , it is possible to construct a unitarized @xmath1 scalar - isoscalar amplitude which both preserves chiral symmetry constraints ( weinberg scattering length in the chiral limit ) and reproduces experimental phase shifts . on top of precursor effects of chiral symmetry restoration , the inclusion of medium effects associated with the modification of the pion dispersion relation should be consistently done in the framework of the njl model by direct coupling to constituent quarks populating the fermi sea .",
    "however , the resulting pion p - wave polarizability calculated with quark - particles  quark - holes would completely miss the phenomenologically well established strong screening effects from short - range correlations ( @xmath5 parameter ) .",
    "incorporation of correlation effects in the njl model obviously requires a much more involved level of sophistication , hence loosing the simplicity which is one of its main interest .",
    "furthermore we will calculate the in - medium two - pion propagator from standard pion - nucleus phenomenology .",
    "in other words , the p - wave pion polarizability will be taken as its nuclear matter expression dominated in the region of interest by the @xmath6-hole piece corrected by screening effects .",
    "the underlying philosophy can be summarized in saying that the medium modified soft physics linked to chiral symmetry ( @xmath7 , low energy @xmath1 potential ) is calculated within the njl model while p - wave physics yielding pionic nuclear collective modes is described through standard nuclear phenomenology .",
    "to examine the @xmath8 interaction at finite density ( and finite temperature ) , we start from the su(2 ) version of the well - known njl model@xcite : @xmath9 \\ ,   \\label{njl}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a coupling strength of dimension [ mass]@xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the current quark mass . to maintain the asymptotic freedom at high energies , we simulate the situation by regarding the coupling constant in eq .",

    "the density @xmath71 turns out to be @xmath72 .",
    "once unitarization is done ( see section 5 ) this density goes down to about @xmath73 due to the presence of the two - pion loop in the sigma propagator .",
    "we will come to this important point in section 5 since , as pointed out by hatsuda _",
    "@xcite , the vanishing of the real part of the inverse sigma propagator at @xmath74 can be seen as a precursor effect of chiral symmetry restoration .",

    "it is important to note that the introduction of such a form factor does not destroy in any way the chiral symmetry properties .",
    "taking @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 one gets a reasonable fit to experimental phase shifts @xcite .",
    "with such a separable potential one easily obtains the explicit form of the @xmath0 matrix  : @xmath143 with @xmath144 given by  : @xmath145 on figure 6 , we present the results of the calculation for the @xmath8 strength function ( _ i.e. _ the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude ) for zero density , half nuclear matter density ( @xmath146)and normal nuclear matter density ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "we limit ourselves to the low energy sector ( @xmath148 ) since it corresponds to the domain of validity of the low energy effective theory and to the region experimentally probed for instance in the chaos experiment . on fig .",
    "6a we keep the sigma mass , the pion mass and the pion decay constant at their vacuum values and incorporate the effects of p - wave @xmath149 collective modes .",
    "we recover the well - known structure near the two - pion threshold originating from the softening of the pion dispersion relation and extensively discussed in @xcite . in fig .",
    "6b , we disregard the effect of these pionic modes but simply replace in the vacuum t matrix the sigma mass , the pion mass and the pion decay constant by their in - medium value . in this way we isolate the effects",
    "intimately related to chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "we see a spectacular enhancement of the strength with increasing density which is roughly uniform in the energy domain considered .",
    "the origin of this effect is mainly the dropping of the sigma mass .",
    "however , it is less pronounced in the density domain typical of ordinary nuclei than in the work of hatsuda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for at least two obvious reasons .",
    "first , we start with a vacuum sigma mass of 1 gev ( used in our previous works to fit the phase shifts ) significantly larger than the values of @xmath150 mev or @xmath151 mev used in @xcite .",
    "second , the @xmath88 coupling constant @xmath152 slightly decreases at variance with the work of hatsuda _ et al . _ where it was density independent .",
    "we will come to a more detailed comparison of the two works when discussing the sigma propagator itself . in fig .",
    "6c , we include simultaneously the two mechanisms .",
    "we recover the typical low energy structure associated to pionic collective modes but significantly reenforced by the effect of chiral symmetry restoration .    to study the evolution with density of scalar - isoscalar modes , it is also very interesting to study the sigma meson spectral function _",
    "i.e. _ the imaginary part of the sigma propagator .",
    "it is a simple matter to obtain the explicit form of the sigma meson propagator in this simple model @xcite  : @xmath153 with the sigma self - energy given by  : @xmath154 the results of the calculation are shown on figure 7 for the three previous cases  : pionic collective modes only ( fig . 6a ) , chiral symmetry restoration only ( fig .",
    "6b ) and both ( fig .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our results with the calculation of ref.@xcite where chiral symmetry restoration is implemented by only dropping the sigma mass , ignoring the modification of the @xmath88 coupling constant . since we find in this present work that @xmath89 is only slightly modified ( about 20% lower at @xmath155 ) it is not surprising that the reinforcement of the low energy enhancement is qualitatively similar in these two works at least at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "until now we have considered the density regime accessible in experiments on ordinary nuclei such as the chaos experiments .",
    "it is however extremely interesting to go beyond , although the basics nuclear physics ingredients of the calculation are less under control .",
    "we now follow for a while the arguments of @xcite .",
    "let us consider the spectral function of the sigma meson  : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is as usual the in - medium sigma meson mass obtained here from the njl model .",
    "as in the work of hatsuda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , this in - medium sigma meson mass has an evolution which follows linearly at low density the scalar condensate",
    ". however the precise law of evolution is different since it comes from a nucleonic tadpole diagram in @xcite .",
    "near the two - pion threshold the phase space factor yields to the well - known behavior  : @xmath158 before chiral symmetry restoration with complete @xmath159 degeneracy , it must exist a density at which @xmath160 or @xmath161 .",
    "at such a density @xmath71 , ignoring the effect of pionic collective modes , the spectral function behaves as  : @xmath162 this implies that there arises a mild integrable singularity just above the two - pion threshold in the medium . with our set of parameters this precursor effect of chiral symmetry restoration",
    "occurs at a density slightly larger than @xmath163 at variance with @xcite where this density was found at @xmath164 .",
    "in addition when collective pionic modes are included , there is strength below two - pion threshold due to the various sources of width ( @xmath114 , @xmath165 ) . as a consequence",
    ", the mathematical singularity disappears .",
    "however , a precursor effect still manifests itself through a strong enhancement of the near - threshold structure created by the p - wave pionic collective modes .",
    "this feature is illustrated on fig .",
    "7 where the influence of chiral symmetry restoration itself is visible by comparison of fig . 7a and fig . 7b",
    "in this paper we have examined medium effects on the unitarized pion - pion interaction in the scalar - isoscalar channel and the sigma meson spectral function .",
    "the new feature of this work is the simultaneous treatment of chiral symmetry restoration and nuclear effect associated with the existence of collective pionic modes .",
    "starting from the standard nambu - jona - lasinio model generalized at finite density , we have obtained an in - medium pion - pion potential . in particular , we have shown that the njl model regenerates the linear sigma model potential but with modified parameters ( @xmath157 , @xmath112 and @xmath166 ) .",
    "this modification of the parameters intimately related to chiral symmetry restoration strongly reenforces the @xmath167 strength function in the threshold region . since the njl model is not adapted to the calculation of collective pionic modes , we have used the standard phenomenological nuclear physics approach",
    "when both effects are incorporated , the low - energy @xmath167 structure resulting from the existence of nuclear collective modes is significantly enhanced in particular through the dropping of the sigma mass .",
    "this feature is obviously of considerable importance for the understanding of the structure observed by the chaos collaboration in @xmath2 experiments on various nuclei .",
