    "the quantum mechanical diffraction of an electron beam on the periodic potential generated by a standing light wave is referred to as kapitza - dirac effect @xcite .",
    "the process relies on the quantum wave nature of the electron and represents a counterpart of classical diffraction of light on a grating , with the roles of light and matter interchanged . in its original version @xcite the kapitza - dirac effect can be understood as a combined absorption and emission process involving two photons : the incident electron absorbs one photon of momentum @xmath0 from one of the laser beams which forms the standing wave , and emits another photon of momentum @xmath1 into the counterpropagating laser beam ( stimulated compton scattering ) . the momentum transfer from the standing wave to the electron",
    "thus amounts to @xmath2 .    a clear experimental verification of the kapitza - dirac effect as originally proposed has been accomplished only recently . utilizing modern state - of - the - art equipment and a laser intensity of the order of @xmath3w/@xmath4 ,",
    "the expected electron diffraction pattern was recorded @xcite .",
    "another successful experiment observed electron ( rainbow ) scattering after atomic ionization in a standing laser wave of higher intensity @xmath5w/@xmath4 @xcite . also beams of atoms can be subject to kapitza - dirac scattering @xcite which was observed both in the so - called bragg @xcite and diffraction @xcite regimes .",
    "the recent observation of kapitza - dirac scattering of electrons has led to a newly revived interest from the theoretical side .",
    "while seminal work on the kapitza - dirac effect and its multiphoton generalization to intense laser fields has already been performed in the 1960s @xcite , various additional aspects have been studied during the last decade .",
    "the influence of the electronic wavepacket size was examined @xcite , a generalization to two electrons was proposed @xcite , and spin effects were investigated @xcite .",
    "also relativistic treatments of the kapitza - dirac effect have been presented based on the dirac equation @xcite and the klein - gordon equation @xcite , respectively .",
    "interesting features of electron - laser interactions can emerge in two - color light fields containing two different frequency components @xcite .",

    "[ fig : bessel ] where the kapitza - dirac scattering pattern is shown for each monochromatic wave alone [ panels ( a ) and ( b ) ] and for the combined , bichromatic wave [ panel ( c ) ] .",

    "<S> coherent scattering of an electron beam by the kapitza - dirac effect from a standing laser wave which comprises two frequency components is studied . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , the schrdinger equation is solved numerically with a suitable ponderomotive potential . besides , an analytical solution for electron diffraction in the asymptotic domain of large field amplitudes is obtained and a mathematical model in reduced dimensionality for the scattering amplitude in the bragg regime is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate distinct interference signatures and relative phase effects when the standing wave contains a fundamental frequency and its second harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the relative field intensities on the rabi oscillation dynamics is also discussed . </S>"
