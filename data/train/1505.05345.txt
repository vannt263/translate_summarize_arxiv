    "in the great number of topological insulators ( ti ) and topological superconductors ( tsc ) discovered or proposed@xcite , the transition from topologically trivial to nontrivial phases can in general be triggered by varying all kinds of energy parameters , e.g. , chemical potential@xcite , hopping@xcite , interface coupling@xcite , etc .",
    "the canonical way of identifying the topological phase transition is to first consult the dimension and symmetry class@xcite of the system to see if topologically nontrivial phases are possible , and if so then seek for the value of the driving energy parameter at which the spectral gap closes at certain momenta , since topological phase transition necessarily involves band inversion .",
    "ideally , the topological invariant jumps discretely when the system undergoes a topological phase transition , therefore it seems rather ambiguous to identify any asymptotic critical behavior from the topological invariant itself .",
    "drawing analogy from the landau order parameter paradigm , a profound question is whether there exists a universal scaling scheme that can judge the topological phase transitions driven by any energy parameter in any dimension and symmetry class , and if the scaling procedure is by any means different from kadanoff s scaling theory@xcite since the systems under question possess no landau order parameter .",
    "moreover , it would be of tremendous usage if the scaling scheme also renormalizes the driving energy parameter . the proposal related to entanglement",
    "entropy first shed a light on this issue@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since a great number of tis and tscs are characterized by the topological invariants that are often calculated from the momentum space integration of a certain integrand function that represents the curvature of the many - body state , it is natural to suspect that a scaling scheme that renormalizes the integrand function can be used to judge topology . depending on the system , the integrand function may be berry curvature@xcite , berry connection@xcite , or any other quantity whose integration gives the topological invariant .",
    "for the sake of a general discussion , hereafter the integrand function is referred to as the curvature function , and the topological invariant calculated from the integration of the curvature function is referred to as the winding number ( to draw analogy to the number of knots in a closed string , and to distinguish it from other means of calculating topological invariants ) . if a scaling scheme for the curvature function exists and gives a rg flow of the driving energy parameter that judges the topological phase transition , the following criteria are expected : ( 1 ) the fixed point in the parameter space of the driving energy parameter has a particular configuration of curvature function that is invariant under the scaling procedure .",
    "( 2 ) any point in the parameter space flows into some fixed point while preserving the winding number during the flow .",
    "( 3 ) different fixed points correspond to different winding numbers .    in this article",
    ", we propose a scaling procedure that satisfies the aforementioned criteria for inversion - symmetric systems .",
    "the motivation comes from a simple observation : to know the number of knots that a messy string contains , one can either integrate the curvature along the string ( integrating the curvature function to get winding number ) , or simply stretch the string until the knots become obvious ( the proposed scaling procedure ) .",
    "a single equation is proposed to implement this knot - tying principle in ti and tsc : let @xmath0 be the curvature function at momentum @xmath1 from which the winding number in @xmath2-dimension @xmath3 is calculated , with @xmath4 the driving energy parameter that controls the topology . given a @xmath4 in the parameter space , we seek for a new @xmath5 that satisfies @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a high symmetry point , and @xmath8 is a small deviation away from it satisfying @xmath9 . as we shall see in the examples below , the operation of eq .",
    "( [ scaling_scheme_general ] ) in inversion - symmetric ti or tsc correctly captures the topological phase transition driven by any energy parameter .",
    "the fixed point is reached by iteratively solving @xmath4 , and by considering a small deviation @xmath8 , one obtains the rg equation for @xmath4 in the form of differential equation .",
    "the curvature function gradually evolves into a fixed point configuration that is invariant under this procedure , analogous to a string with its knots tight and can not be stretched anymore . moreover , for a great variety of models , an asymptotic universal critical behavior of the curvature function near the gap - closing momenta is revealed despite the system in general has no landau order parameter or any short range correlation .",
    "the critical behavior may be varified by ultracold atoms in optical lattices in the case that the curvature function is the berry curvature .",
    "to explain the mechanism behind eq .",
    "( [ scaling_scheme_general ] ) and demonstrate its analogy to knot - tying , consider a inversion - symmetric ti or tsc defined on a @xmath2-dimensional cubic lattice . if the system at @xmath4 and at the fixed point @xmath10 have the same topology , then the curvature function at @xmath4 can be expanded by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fixed point curvature function that satisfies @xmath13 , i.e. , it is invariant under the operation of eq .",
    "( [ scaling_scheme_general ] ) , and @xmath14 is the deviation away from this fixed point configuration at @xmath4 , which has fourier component @xmath15 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath14 is sound because it must not contribute to the integration of winding number @xmath16 such that the system at @xmath4 and at @xmath10 have the same topology .",
    "suppose we choose a particular high symmetry point such as @xmath17 , and a small displacement away from it along @xmath18-th coordinate @xmath19 .",
    "now we apply the operation of eq .",
    "( [ scaling_scheme_general ] ) by using eq .",
    "( [ berry_curvature_d_dimension ] ) .",
    "expanding around @xmath7 gives @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sign of @xmath22 at the chosen @xmath7 and at the fourier component @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is the deviation at @xmath7 .",
    "writting @xmath25 and introducing a pseudo scaling parameter @xmath26 , one obtains @xmath27 this means the deviation at @xmath7 changes under this operation according to the slope of the deviation at @xmath28 .",
    "if the initial value @xmath4 gives @xmath29 , i.e. , a positive ( negative ) deviation at @xmath7 , then @xmath14 must curve down ( curve up ) as moving from @xmath7 to @xmath28 in order to conserve the winding number , so @xmath30 and consequently @xmath31 is reduced under this scaling procedure .",
    "thus continuously applying eq .",
    "( [ scaling_scheme_general ] ) makes @xmath14 approaching zero and @xmath0 approaching @xmath12 . in other words , the principle behind eq .",
    "( [ scaling_scheme_general ] ) is that the deviation of the curvature function from its fixed point configuration is gradually reduced under this scaling procedure .",
    "as we shall see below , in @xmath32 systems , this is synonymous to stretching a messy string to reduce its messiness until the knots are tight .",
    "in general , there could be a situation that @xmath33 and @xmath34 at a given @xmath4 so @xmath31 increases at the beginning of the scaling process , but @xmath31 must eventually be reduced because the scaling process still leads to @xmath35 in order to conserve winding number .",
    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ scaling_scheme_general ] ) in both @xmath36 and @xmath37 yields the rg equation . in the leading order ,",
    "@xmath38 this explains that the proper scaling parameter should be defined as quadratic in the displacement @xmath37 , whereas the @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ rg_equation_d_dimension ] ) is merely introduced to demonstrate the deviation - reduction mechanism .",
    "since the rg equation involves only one variable @xmath4 , it is always possible to map the rg flow into the motion of an overdamped particle in a conservative potential@xcite .",
    "equation ( [ berry_curvature_d_dimension ] ) , together with the fact that at critical point @xmath40 the curvature function diverges at the gap - closing momentum which is at a high symmetry point @xmath7 if the system is inversion - symmetric@xcite , indicate that the curvature function near the gap - closing point @xmath7 can be expanded by @xmath41 as shown below , @xmath42 explicitly characterizes the scale invariance at the fixed point or critical point .",
    "note that although eq .",
    "( [ correlation_length_definition ] ) is similar to the ornstein - zernike form of correlation function@xcite , @xmath42 does not represent the correlation length of short range fluctuations which is obviously absent in ti and tsc .",
    "instead , it is a length scale defined from the curvature function near the gap - closing point that signals the scale invariance under the proposed scaling scheme .",
    "alternatively , one may use its inverse @xmath43 as a momentum scale to characterize the scale invariance , which works equally well .",
    "two remarks are made before we move to concrete examples .",
    "firstly , as in any rg procedure , this scaling scheme itself does not give a meaning to the fixed point , i.e. , it does not tell us whether the fixed point is topologically trivial or nontrivial , which may nevertheless be clarified by direct calculation of eq .  ( [ winding_number_integration ] ) at @xmath10 or at any @xmath4 that flows to the @xmath10 .",
    "secondly , @xmath4 may increase or decrease along the rg flow , but the notion of relevant , irrelevant , or marginal coupling constants@xcite does not seem to apply to @xmath4 , since the topological phase transitions are judged by the sign change of the rg equation in eq .",
