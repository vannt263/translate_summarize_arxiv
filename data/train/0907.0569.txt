    "nuclear beams of an energy higher than 1  _ a _  gev are recognized as a modern tool used for the study of the structure of atomic nuclei ( a recent review @xcite ) . among the variety of nuclear interactions",
    "the peripheral dissociation bears a uniquely complete information about the excited states above particle decay thresholds .",
    "the peripheral dissociation is revealed as a narrow jet of relativistic fragments the summary charge of which is close to the charge of the primary nucleus . in spite of the relativistic velocity of motion the internal velocities in the jet are non - relativistic @xcite .",
    "information about the generation of such fragment ensembles can be useful in nuclear astrophysics ( indirect approaches ) , as well as in develoments of nucleosynthesis scenarios on the basis of multi - particle fusion .",
    "it is necessary to provide a complete observation of fragments to utilize this possibility .",
    "the difficulties of principle are here as follows .",
    "an increase in the dissociation degree of a relativistic nucleus leads to a decrease in the response of the fragment detector .",
    "this circumstance makes the complete analysis of relativistic fragments , which is necessary up to the he and h isotopes , rather difficult .",
    "the excited state is identified by the invariant mass of the relativistic fragment jet . therefore the most accurate measurements of the emission angles of fragments are needed .",
    "the accuracy of measurements of the momenta is not so rigid , it is possible to assume that the fragments conserve the primary momentum per nucleus .",
    "in addition , the selection of extremely peripheral collisions requires that the threshold of detection of the target fragments in a total solid angle would be reduced to a minimum .",
    "the nuclear emulsion technique solves these problems and makes it possible to perform rather effectively survey investigations on newly produced beams @xcite .",
    "unique information about the structure of peripheral dissociation of many nuclei has already been obtained in @xcite and etc .",
    "limitations imposed to statistics are compensated by the fact that the fragment jet structures are inaccessible for observation in other approaches .",
    "besids , the emulsion compound containing both the h , ag , and br nuclei in comparable concentrations ( ratio about 3.2/1./1 . ) turns out to be use ful for comparing interactions . under the same conditions it is possible to observe the very peripheral break - up in the electromagnetic field of a heavy target nucleus as well as in collisions with target protons .",
    "the response of the emulsion nuclei includes the multiplicity of strongly ionizing target fragments from @xmath3 particles up to recoil nuclei _",
    "n@xmath8 _ and non - relativistic h nuclei _",
    "n@xmath9_. besides , the reactions are characterized by the multiplicity of produced mesons _ n@xmath10_. the events in which there are no tracks of target nucleus fragmentation belong to dissociation on ag , br and are named white   stars ( _ n@xmath8 _  =  0 , _",
    "n@xmath9 _  =  0 , _ n@xmath10",
    "_  =  0 ) @xcite .",
    "dissociation on a proton must lead to the appearance of its track , that is , _",
    "n@xmath8 _  =  0 , _ n@xmath9 _  =  1 , and _",
    "n@xmath10 _  =  0 .",
    "the structure of the events of these two types is just the subject of the present paper .    the presence of strongly ionizing particle ( _ n@xmath11 _  0 ) tracks in the vertex or relativistic particle ( _ n@xmath12 _  0 ) tracks outside the fragmentation cone makes it possible to define the interaction as the one which is occurred with an overlap of the densities of colliding nuclei or with c , n and o nuclei in the cases of extremely short tracks of recoil nuclei . in principle , mutual excitation and simultaneous fragmentation of both colliding nuclei are possible .",
    "the discussion of these events is outside the scope of the present paper and their statistics is given for the sake of an illustration .    in what follows ,",
    "the of the @xmath0b , @xmath13be and @xmath6n dissociation channels are discussed .",
    "the results are obtained in a br-2 emulsion with relativistic sensitivity which was exposed to the jinr nuclotron beams .",
    "the secondary @xmath0b and @xmath13be beams were produced in the fragmentation of the primary @xmath14b beam at an energy about 1.2  _ a _  gev @xcite .",
    "due to the small values of the proton binding energy the @xmath0b nucleus is a sensitive probe of the type of the interaction up to the lowest momentum transfers .",
    "the study of the events with a total relativistic fragment charge of @xmath16z@xmath17  =  5 in an emulsion exposed to @xmath0b nuclei enabled one to establish the leading contribution of the white   stars @xmath0b@xmath18b+_p _ as compared with the stars containing the target fragments @xcite .",
    "this fact shows a qualitative difference from @xmath14b nuclei for which white   stars 2he+h were predominant @xcite .    a detailed distribution of the @xmath0b dissociation over the fragment configurations @xmath16z@xmath17 and the numbers of the target fragments _ n@xmath8 _ and _ n@xmath9 _ is given in table  1 .",
    "first of all , the predominance of white   stars @xmath0b@xmath18be+_p _ should be noted ( example is shown in fig .  1 ) .",
    "in this channel , there is practically no dissociation on protons _",
    "n@xmath9  _",
    "the difference is due to a rapid increase in the em dissociation cross section with increasing target nucleus charge ( like z@xmath19 ) .",
    "half a number of white   stars is associated with 3- and 4- particle dissociation modes having much higher thresholds .",
    "this implies that the multiple fragmentation can be initiated by an em excitation .",
    "it may also be noted that in the 2he+h and he+3h channels the fraction of the events on protons ( _ n@xmath9 _  =  1 ) and the events with target fragments ( _ _ n@xmath20__0 ) with respect to the @xmath21be+_p _ channel becomes the major one and increases by a factor of 5 as compared with the case of white   stars ( _ _ n@xmath8  _ _ =  0 , _ _",
    "n@xmath9  _ _ =  0 ) .",
    "it is obvious that such a tendency is connected with an increase of direct proton - nucleon collisions .",
    "a further accumulation of statistics on white   stars @xmath0b@xmath22he+h is of special interest ( example is shown in fig .",
    "as is known , multiple scattering measurements can be used to identify relativistic @xmath22h and @xmath23he isotopes . in spite of the fact that these measurements are labour demanding , the appropriate efforts can be compensated by the identification of a 3-particle mode @xmath0b@xmath22@xmath24he+@xmath25h ( threshold of 20 mev ) .",
    "this possibility is non - trivial because it is connected with a deep rearrangement of the @xmath0b cluster structure .",
    "the properties of this state near the threshold may turn out to be important for an inverse fusion process too . a particular feature of the 2@xmath24he+@xmath25h fusion process might consist in a larger number of vacancies for a neutron to be captured in the @xmath26he cluster formation .",
    "the conclusions about the em dissociation of the @xmath0b and @xmath21be nuclei @xcite form the basis for a comparative analysis of the @xmath13c nucleus as the next step .",
    "the beam of these nuclei is created in the fragmentation of @xmath27c nuclei of an energy of 1.2 gev , it is used to expose emulsion . in all probability , the pattern for @xmath0b and @xmath21be nuclei with the addition of one or , respectively",
    ", two protons must be reproduced for the @xmath13c dissociation .",
    "in addition the dissociation @xmath13c@xmath23@xmath24he ( threshold of 16 mev ) will become accessible for observation .",
    "the observation of 3@xmath24he population near the threshold would allow one to put the ground for an extension of the well - known 3@xmath3 fusion process toward 3@xmath24he one .",
    "the emulsion exposed to @xmath0b nuclei allowed us to observe events with the total charge of relativistic fragments @xmath16z@xmath28  =  6 from the mixture of @xmath14c nuclei produced in the generating target due to the charge exchange process @xmath14b@xmath29c .",
    "their distributions over the charge track topology are given in the two lower lines of table  1 .",
    "even restricted statistics points out that the 2he+2h breakup accompanied by the conservation of @xmath3 particle clusters in white   stars is more preferable ( example is shown in fig .",
    "a low @xmath4be+2_p _ channel threshold equal to 3.8 mev is manifested in such a way",
    ".    the @xmath14b@xmath29c charge exchange can be used for further exposures of emulsions with the aim not only to explore the main channel of dissociation 2he+2h but also to establish existence of the dissociation mode @xmath14c@xmath30he+2@xmath24he ( threshold of 17 mev ) . in just the same way as in the @xmath13c case its discovery can enlarge the picture of the 3he fusion process in nuclear astrophysics . to search for @xmath0b@xmath22he+h and @xmath15c@xmath23he related to the fragmentation channels it is possible to perform a scanning over the area .",
    "this method was already used for accelerating the search for the events @xmath27c@xmath23he @xcite and @xmath31o@xmath24he @xcite , as is discussed below , for @xmath1be@xmath22he .",
    "the @xmath1be nucleus is a source for the study of the ground and excited states of the @xmath4be nucleus .",
    "information about the generation of a relativistic 2@xmath3 particle system without the presence of the combinatory background of other @xmath3 particles can be utilized in analyzing more complicated n@xmath3 systems .",
    "the present - day interest in such systems is inspired by the suggested search for the @xmath3 particle bose ",
    "einstein condensate @xcite in which a ground 0@xmath5 and the first excited 2@xmath5 states of the @xmath4be nucleus must play the role of condensate basic elements . the proof of existence of such a quantum state of dilute nuclear matter should be very important in the development of the ideas about nucleosynthesis .",
    "the peripheral dissociation to relativistic n@xmath3 jets may turn out to be the most convenient tool for searching for it @xcite .    in an emulsion exposed to relativistic @xmath1be nuclei 362 events of fragmentation to a narrow pair of relativistic he nuclei",
    "were analyzed under the assumption of their correspondence to 2@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a subset of 283 events with _ _",
    "n@xmath32__=  0 is considered below .",
    "clear apperance of two peaks in the distribution over the invariant mass above the @xmath3 particle pair mass threshold q@xmath33 was identified .",
    "it was concluded that the 0@xmath5 and 2@xmath5 states of @xmath4be are revealed in the spectra over q@xmath33 .",
    "the observations of the @xmath1be interaction vertices allows one to separate the population of these states for em and direct nucleon interactions .",
    "table  2 gives the distribution of the @xmath1be@xmath22he events in the major intervals over q@xmath33 and the configurations of accompanying tracks .",
    "the principal feature of the distribution consists in an evident dominance of 144 white   starts ( _ n@xmath8 _  =  0 , _",
    "n@xmath9 _  =  0 ) amounting about 60@xmath34 . only 27 events ( 11@xmath34 )",
    "are ascribed to the stars resulting from @xmath1be collisions with protons ( _ n@xmath8 _  =  0 , _",
    "n@xmath9 _  =  1 ) .",
    "the ratio of the white   stars from the states 0@xmath5 ( q@xmath35  1 mev ) and 2@xmath5 ( 1@xmath36q@xmath35  4  mev ) is equal to _ r@xmath37 _",
    "=  3@xmath380.6 and in the case of collisions with target protons ( _ n@xmath8 _  =  0 , _ n@xmath9",
    "_  =  1 ) it is equal to _ r@xmath37 _  =  1  @xmath39  0.5 .",
    "thus , in peripheral fragmentation the production of an @xmath3 particle pair via the ground @xmath4be state proceeds more intensively than for _ n  p _ knockout processes .",
    "the same conclusion is also valid for the events in which only one target nucleus fragment ( _ n@xmath8 _  =  1 , _",
    "n@xmath9 _  =  0 ) is revealed and _ r@xmath37 _  =  1.5@xmath380.5 .",
    "following the concept about the @xmath1be nucleus as a cluster system @xmath40n@xmath41 it may be supposed that the ground state of this nucleus contains with a noticeable probability a pair of @xmath3 particle clusters with angular momentum _",
    "the presence of a neutron gives the value for the @xmath1be spin 3/2 .",
    "when the neutron is knocked out by the target proton there proceeds either a dispersion of the @xmath3 particle pair from the d - state or a radiation transition to the @xmath4be ground state 0@xmath5 .",
    "an inverse @xmath1be synthesis process might be considered as a radiation transition 0@xmath42  2@xmath5 in the presence of the neutron . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath3 pair goes out from the mass surface with @xmath43 emission .",
    "such a picture is worthy of checking in experiments with @xmath43 detection .",
    "4 shows the total transverse momentum distribution transferred to @xmath3 pairs _",
    "p@xmath44 _ for white   stars ( _ a _ ) and from a break - ups on protons ( _ b _ ) .",
    "the following average values are obtained - _ @xmath45p@xmath46 _  = 138  @xmath47  12 mev / c ( _ n@xmath8 _  =  0 , _",
    "n@xmath9 _  =  0 ) and 194@xmath3828 mev / c ( _ n@xmath8 _  =  0 , _",
    "n@xmath9 _  =  1 )",
    ". there is a noticeable difference in the average values and the distribution shapes which points to different dynamics of @xmath3 pair production .",
    "the @xmath1be disintegration on a proton turns out to be a more rigid reaction mechanism as compared with disintegration on a ag , br .",
    "an increase in the target fragmentation multiplicity can be expected to result in an explicit increase in _ @xmath45p@xmath46 _",
    "( table  2 ) .",
    "a further growth of the multiplicity corresponding to a larger nucleus overlap leads to a suppression of the 2he event statistics owing to a destruction of the @xmath1be structure destruction .",
    "the study of the peripheral dissociation of @xmath6n nuclei of an energy of 2.1  _ a _",
    "gev in the fragment state z@xmath17  =  7 @xcite has resulted in the conclusion about the leading part of the @xmath6n@xmath23he channel .",
    "therefore the peripheral @xmath6n dissociation can be used as an effective source of 3@xmath3 systems .",
    "the dominant part of the events was shown to be concentrated in the interval of the invariant 3@xmath3 particle mass over the @xmath27c mass 7@xmath36q@xmath4820  mev covering the @xmath3 particle levels just above the @xmath27c dissociation threshold .",
    "thus , the problems of a few - body nuclear physics near the @xmath3 emission threshold can be explored using detection advantages of the relativistic collisions .",
    "the patteren of the target fragment accompaniment in the @xmath6n dissociation ( table  3 ) is of the same nature as in the case for @xmath1be . in spite of some increase in the threshold over q , the main @xmath3 particle channel of the systems",
    "is the em dissociation on heavy nuclei .",

    "the ratio of the numbers of events with _",

    "n@xmath9 _  =  0 ) .",
    "the value of the mean transverse momentum transferred to 5@xmath3 particle systems in these events when normalized to the @xmath3 particle number is located in the region typical for dissociation of light nuclei with a pronounced @xmath3 clustering .",
    "the investigations with light nuclei create a methodical basis for the study of exclusively complicated systems he - h-_n _ for the energy scale relevant for nuclear astrophysics . in this respect ,",
    "the motivated prospects are associated with a detailed analysis of the already observed fragment jets in the events of complete em dissociation of au nuclei at 10.6  _ a _",

    "possessing a record space resolution the nuclear emulsion method keeps unique possibilities in studying the structure particularities of light nuclei , first of all , of neutron - deficient nuclei .",
    "the presented results of an exclusive study of the interactions of relativistic @xmath4b and @xmath1be nuclei in nuclear emulsion lead to the conclusion that the particular features of their structure are clearly manifested in peripheral dissociations . in spite of an extraordinarily large distinction from the nuclear excitation energy the relativistic scale not only does not impede investigations of nuclear interactions in energy scale typical for nuclear astrophysics , but on the contrary gives new methodical advantages .",
    "the main advantage is the possibility of principle of observing and investigating multi - particle systems .",
    "the study of the relativistic dissociation of @xmath6n nucleus to a 3he system confirm this prospect .",
    "the presented observations can also serve as an illustration of unique prospects of the emulsion method for nuclear astrophysics using relativistic nuclei . providing the three - dimensional observation of dissociation events",
    "the nuclear emulsion method gives unique possibilities of moving toward more and more complicated nuclear systems generated in peripheral dissociations .",
