    "the high - accuracy universal polarimeter ( haup ) @xcite has proved to be a very useful instrument to measure the crystal optical properties ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the principle is simple and was introduced a long time ago ( see @xcite for an historical introduction ) : the light intensity measured after a rotating high quality polariser , a crystal plate ( the sample ) and a high quality rotating analyser , is fitted to a theoretical formula with several coefficients as free parameters where the delay due to birefringence and optical activity can be determined .",
    "the accuracy of this instrument has now reached the few @xmath0 level and systematic errors contributing at this order of magnitude have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that roughness is most likely one of the main source of systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , despite an extensive literature on surface roughness @xcite , no theoretical expression for the transmission of a gaussian beam by an anisotropic rough platelet is available .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to provide this expression .",
    "we consistently take into account the gaussian nature of the laser beam , the multiple reflection inside the plate and the roughness of both faces of the plate . to simplify the calculations",
    "we further restrict ourselves to uniaxial homogeneous crystals . as a result",
    ", we find that unlike plane waves , specular gaussian beams are affected by the surfaces roughness , even in the first order perturbation theory .",
    "the physical origin of this phenomenon is the angular distribution , or plane wave expansion , of gaussian beams @xcite .",
    "plane waves constituting a gaussian beam having different wave vectors , a given plane wave can then be scattered in the specular direction of the other ones .",
    "the resulting interference pattern leads to an a priori non vanishing contribution of the scattered field in the specular region . to some extent ,",
    "this phenomenon is thus related to the near - specular scattering by rough surfaces introduced in @xcite .",
    "another aspect of realistic platelet surfaces is the interface parallelism default .",
    "depending on the wedge angle , this default can compete with roughness in the modifications of the transmitted beam polarisation .",
    "the nature of these effects is however different . given the relative orientation of the two plate interfaces , the wedge effect is univocal whereas roughness , as it will be shown in this paper , is of random nature .",
    "it is then most likely that these two effects can not compensate each other . in principle , the perturbative calculations reported in the present article holds for both effects .",
    "nevertheless , the boundary matching method , applied a long time ago to isotropic wedges @xcite , can be used to describe the wedge effect .",
    "we shall report this calulation in a future publication and restrict ourselves here on platelet roughness .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we derive the theoretical expressions and numerical simulations of quartz plates are presented in section [ numerical ] .",
    "the choice of the theoretical formalism is driven by the properties of the crystal plate surfaces under study .",
    "fortunately , an exhaustive experimental study on crystal surfaces has recently been published @xcite .",
    "most of the high quality polished crystal surfaces used in optics have a profile surface correlation length of the order of the optical wavelength and a root mean square roughness of the order of a few angstrm .",
    "it means that one can safely use a first order perturbation theory @xcite neglecting the local field effects@xcite .",
    "the more suitable formalism for our problem is the one introduced in @xcite and generalised to anisotropic overlayers in @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter reference , the anisotropy is treated perturbatively and only the reflection of plane waves is considered .",
    "we shall then extend this formalism to platelet s transmission taking fully into account the plate anisotropy and treating perturbatively the plate roughness .    in the following we tried to be concise , referring to @xcite for further details .",

    "the profiles of the quartz surfaces @xmath131 and @xmath132 are thus randomly generated independently .",

    "the parameter @xmath147 acts as a spatial frequency threshold for the laser radius : roughly speaking , for @xmath148 the gaussian beam behaves as a plane - wave and the specular - scattered interference term vanishes .",
    "nevertheless , the present values of @xmath141 are limited by the acceptance of the surface profile measurements : values as small as @xmath149m@xmath146 for si substrates@xcite and @xmath150m@xmath146 for @xmath141 for si wafers @xcite have been reported ( notice that these numbers lead to a laser radius threshold greater than 15  mm ) .",
    "finally , the inverse fourier transform is computed leading to a ` coloured ' random surface .",
    "the grid parameters are determined by the correlation length @xmath143 and the laser waist @xmath151 .",

    "this is a cross - polarisation effect , i.e. this is due to the matrix @xmath99 in equations ( [ eq : et1]-[eq : et2 ] ) .",
    "the numerical results presented here are rather independent of the choice for the psd2 provided a quartz plate of optical grade is considered .",
    "it is indeed experimentally demonstrated @xcite that the psds of optical element s surface have an inverse - power - low ( or fractal - like ) behaviour .",
    "therefore , various smooth mathematical representations of the psd ( see @xcite for examples ) are reducible to equation ( [ eq : ps2d ] ) as it is justified in @xcite .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we point out that three important dimensionless parameters @xmath187 , @xmath160 and @xmath188 have been encountered in our calculations ( @xmath189 describes the cross - polarisation effects discussed above and is therefore not relevant here ) .",
    "as mentioned in section [ theory ] , the validity of the perturbation treatment depends on @xmath160 and @xmath188 . using the first order perturbation theory , the severe conditions @xmath190 and @xmath191 must hold@xcite .",
    "they are fortunately fulfilled by optical grade quartz plates . to study the influence of the correlation length @xmath143 , we changed the value of @xmath143 to @xmath192 m and @xmath193 m and we observed no significant qualitative differences with respect to the results described above .",
    "as for the last dimensionless parameter @xmath187 , we already mentioned that when @xmath194 the usual result for plane waves is recovered ( i.e. the specular - scattered interference term vanishes ) although , with regard to the cut - off parameter @xmath141 , this limit seems to be idealistic for a finite size quartz plate .",
    "to get an idea of the influence of @xmath151 , we increased it to @xmath195 m and here again , no significant differences were observed .",
    "much larger values for @xmath151 could not be tried , keeping a reasonable correlation length , because of the computer memory limitation .",
    "finally let us mention that the other limit @xmath196 corresponds to the scattering by gratings @xcite . in this limit",
    "the specular - scattered interference term vanishes since the diffusion occurs at large angle with respect to the specular beam direction .",
    "we have computed , in the leading order perturbation theory , the effect of surfaces roughness on uniaxial platelets transmittance . taking into account the gaussian nature of laser beams we showed that the interference between the specular and scattered fields contributes to the intensity measurement performed in the specular region .",
    "this contribution is of first order in the ratio of the root mean square roughness over the laser wavelength @xmath160 .",
    "it depends strongly on the plate surfaces profiles and on the crystal optical properties , orientation of the optical axis , thickness and optical indices ( i.e. temperature ) .",
    "it is therefore useless to implement the roughness calculation in a haup type of fitting procedure ( in addition , the numerical calculation are computer time consuming ) .    in view of our numerical results , it is most likely that simple overlayer models @xcite can not describe accurately the dynamical properties of our main formula equations ( [ eprime_p],[eprime_s ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that , because of the random property of the specular - scattered interference term , a simple way to avoid it is to perform a series of measurements at different locations on the plate and then to average the results .",
    "although this procedure would increase the uncertainty on the determination of crystal optical parameters , it should however decrease the systematic bias .",
    "the determination of the plate thickness in situ could be done by varying the laser incident angle ( i.e. by tilting the plate ) @xcite .",
