    "bleeker @xcite reviewed in general terms the prospects and results of the bepposax wide field camera instrument package ( `` wfcs '' ) .",
    "the unique capability of matching a wide field of view of @xmath1 per each of two identical cameras with a good angular resolution of 5  @xcite not only led to a revolution of gamma - ray burst research ( e.g. , @xcite ) but also to a serious advance of our knowledge on x - ray bursts and other transient emission processes in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "much of the relevant data was acquired during the only dedicated bepposax observation program involving the wfcs as prime instrument .",
    "this encompasses observations pointed at the galactic center during semi - yearly visibility windows that lasted from mid february to mid april and from mid august to mid october .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the twelve campaigns during the six - year bepposax lifetime .",
    "the combined exposure time represents 8% of the total bepposax exposure budget .",
    "the success of this program may be anticipated by the mere fact that the field of view of one wfc emcompasses more than half the galactic lmxb population according to pre - wfc catalogs @xcite .",
    "another important ingredient for the success is that nearly all observations were analyzed in a near to real - time fashion .",
    "this was possible thanks to the 24 hr per day , 7 days a week , manning of the bepposax science operations center ( which was also crucial to the success of the grb program of bepposax @xcite ) and the dedicated support by the duty scientists.    tied to this program a dedicated target - of - opportunity program was in place for the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfis ) to follow up new transients or bursters .",
    "this program was triggered 14 times , with exposure times between 20 and 40 ksec .",
    "whenever new transients or bursters were discovered , these were announced in iau circulars .",
    "this happened on 20 occasions and triggered independent too programs on bepposax , the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , xmm - newton , and ground - based radio and optical telescopes , illustrating a community service of the wfc program .",
    ".wfc observation campaigns on the galactic center .",
    "the effective exposure times are for the position of the galactic center . adapted from @xcite.[tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^ , > , > \" , ]     ) and the rxte asm ( horizontal lines , solid for the detection , dotted for upper limits ; from @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates exponential decay with e - folding time 5 days .",
    "the v indicates the time of the optical observations ( see fig .",
    "[ figfrankopt ] ) .",
    "[ figfrank ] ]    when browsing through the list ( table  [ tab3 ] ) it is striking that there are only 8 out of the 36 transients that reached peak fluxes in excess of 0.2 crab units ; a substantial fraction of 13 out of 36 is even fainter than 0.05 crab .",
    "sometimes this is accompanied by a short duration , but this is not the rule ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an example of this is given in fig .",
    "[ figfrank ] which presents the light curve of the 1998 outburst of sax j1748.9 - 2021 in the globular cluster ngc 6440 which had an e - folding decay time as short as 5  d. a further noteworthy detail is that most ( 22 ) transients burst and , thus , contain a neutron star . the low outburst peak fluxes indicate sub - eddington luminosities for a canonical 8  kpc distance .",
    "the fact that the observations have detected recurrence in half of all transients suggests that a fair fraction of the lmxb transients with recurrence times below a few years and on - times longer than a few days have now been discovered in this field . assuming that the sample is complete and that this field represents half the total galactic population",
    ", there must be roughly 40 such transients in total .",
    "quicker transients , such as sax  j1748.9 - 2021 @xcite or sax  j1810.8 - 2609 @xcite , are more elusive unless they recur often enough ( such as v4641  sgr , see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "there are 150 globular clusters in the galaxy and 12 contain 13 luminous lmxbs ( m15 has two ) . in a number of clusters , considerable quantities of quiescent lmxbs have been found .",
    "pooley et al .",
    "@xcite estimate a total of 100 mostly quiescent lmxbs in galactic globular clusters .",
    "thus , it is obvious that lmxbs are abundant in clusters ; for instance , luminous lmxbs are 100 times more abundant than in the galactic disk , in terms of number per unit mass @xcite .",
    "the nature of the compact accretor has been determined in 12 of the 13 cases as neutron stars through the detection of type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "the wfcs have established three of these bursters ( see table  [ tab2 ] )",
    ". the one unresolved case , ac211 in m15 , has recently been argued to contain a neutron star as well on the basis of an optical study @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ac211 is a persistent source while all black hole lmxbs are transient .",
    "thus , another disk versus cluster difference concerns the number ratio of black holes to neutron stars in lmxbs .",
    "none of the luminous cluster lmxbs has a confirmed or even a suspected black hole ( 0/13 ) , while there are 37 cases in the galactic disk ( of which 15 dynamically confirmed and 22 suspected ; @xcite ) .",
    "the difference is not very significant though .",
    "if the same disk ratio of 37/150 applies to globular clusters as well , there would be a 3% probability that no black hole systems would be found in a random sample of 13 .",
    "the wfcs made interesting observations of two particular luminous globular cluster lmxbs .",
    "the first concerns ngc 6440 .",
    "no x - ray outburst was detected from this cluster since january 1972 @xcite , but in august 1998 the wfcs detected an outburst which included first - time observations of x - ray bursts .",
    "follow - up observations were carried out with the bepposax - nfi and rosat , and fig .",
    "[ figfrank ] shows the combined light curve .",
    "the transient lasted only a little over a week , and the peak flux was about 50  mcrab .",
    "follow - up observations were also carried out at high spatial resolution in the optical .",
    "comparison with later observations when the transient was off revealed the first - time detection of an optical counterpart to an x - ray transient in a globular cluster , see fig .",
    "[ figfrankopt ] @xcite .",
    "this identification was later confirmed by chandra high - resolution x - ray observations during another outburst @xcite . the fact that some outbursts last very short makes clear that a swift response of follow - up observations is sometimes imperative .",
    "the other interesting wfc observation of a luminous cluster lmxb concerns terzan  6 .",
    "first detected by granat @xcite and rosat @xcite in 1990 , wfc and rxte observations showed that this is a transient with a very regular outburst pattern @xcite like in the rapid burster and aql x-1 with a ( quasi ) period of 4.5 months . by combining wfc data from the first half of the mission it was found that this transient is one of now six known completely eclipsing lmxbs in the galaxy .",
    "the orbital period of 12.4  hr is typical for an lmxb .",
    "the results of the galactic center campaigns of the bepposax wfcs are plentiful .",
    "this is mainly due to its large field of view which enabled to monitor a large fraction of the galactic lmxb population and resulted in a large exposure of roughly 7 million seconds over six years on tens of sources .",
    "such an exposure has not been accomplished by any other device yet .",
    "thus , it has been possible to detect rare phenomena such as superbursts , burst - only sources and swift transients ( e.g. , v4641 sgr ) .",
    "the analysis of wfc data will continue and new results are expected to come out .",
    "this particularly concerns time scales of a few hours and the longest time scales , and weak signals ( e.g. , x - ray bursts fainter than 0.5  crab ) .",
    "the success of the galactic center campaign was in part made possible by the round - the - clock dedication of the duty scientists at the bepposax science operations center in rome and we thank them for their efforts .",
    "we acknowledge the asi science data center at frascati and sron for continued support of bepposax data analysis .",
    "we are grateful to rieks jager and the team at sron for building a wonderful instrument .",
    "the following institutes are acknowledged for financial support : the netherlands organisation for scientific research , the university of utrecht , the netherlands research school for astronomy , cnr - iasf and the italian space agency .",
