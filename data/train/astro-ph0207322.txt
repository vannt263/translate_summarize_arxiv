    "the study of regions forming massive stars is essential to our understanding of how stars are born .",

    "the density distribution in the envelopes of regions forming massive stars is an important observational constraint for star formation models .",
    "the density distribution is usually a power law ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "for example , mclaughlin & pudriz s ( 1997 ) logatropic sphere model predicts a shallow power law with @xmath12 in the static envelope , whereas shu s ( 1977 ) inside - out collapse model for isolated star formation has an initial density distribution with @xmath13 .",

    "the individual scans are shifted by 4  in elevation to extend the mapped region and to eliminate gaps in the map due to bad pixels ( pixels 1 , 5 , 15 , and 16 of the 24 pixels in the sharc array ) .",
    "the scanning rate and elevation shifts were selected to be slightly smaller than the size of the pixel , 5 in the focal plane of the array , to obtain better sampling ( hunter et al .",
    "the secondary was chopped at 1.123 hz with a chop throw of 90  to 100  in the azimuth direction .",
    "sharc observations were conducted only during very dry conditions with @xmath34 0.06 ( see  2.3 below ) .",
    "all of the data were reduced and restored with the standard program camera .",
    "the restoration algorithm is based on a technique described by emerson , klein , & haslam ( 1979 ) .",
    "the despiking routine was used on those maps that had pixels with spikes above 10 @xmath35 , which we identified by visual inspection during reduction .",
    "the routine replaces the spiked pixel with the average value of the adjacent pixels . in some cases",
    "the source was highly peaked , so a higher sigma was used to ensure the central pixel was not removed by the despiking routine .",

    "the destriping affected the maximum pixel value , in most cases decreasing it by less than 10% .",
    "after the data were reduced with camera , gray scale images of the restored and combined bolometer maps were created . the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) was used to find the value of the maximum pixel , the average background , and @xmath35 for each map .",

    "voltages measured in 30  and 120  apertures in three maps of each secondary calibrator were used to determine calibration factors .",

    "while some of the statistical uncertainties are smaller than 20% , we expect systematic errors to not allow fluxes to be determined at 350  to better than 20% ( hunter et al .",
    "furthermore , calibrations in 1997 december determined from ngc 2071ir and w3(oh ) are expected to be worse since neither calibrator is a point source ( see fig .",

    "this effect is obvious in @xmath58 , which is nearly a factor of two lower when using the secondary calibrators .",
    "@xmath59 was not affected by the extended emission and is stable from 1997 december to 1998 july .",
    "for this reason , @xmath58 from 1998 july is used to calibrate all of the 120  aperture fluxes .",
    "radial beam profiles were obtained from two maps of uranus in 1998 july ( figure [ beamfig ] ) .",
    "the data were binned in 5  bins .",
    "broad sidelobes are seen beyond 15 . at 40 ,",
    "the sidelobe power is as high as @xmath60 db . the general shape of the two profiles is consistent , but there are variations in the strength of the sidelobes . fitting the beam profiles with a gaussian , we find that the fwhm is at least 14  which is significantly different from the beam size reported in previous studies using sharc at 350  ( 10 , van der tak et al .",
    "2000 ; 11 , hunter et al .  2000 ) .",
    "the difference could be the result of poor focus or temporal changes in the beam .",
    "young et al .  ( 2002 ) report a 3  change in the fwhm of the james clerk maxwell telescope beam at 450  in the course of a single night .",
    "the beam measurements were not frequent enough to characterize the changes of the cso beam over the course of the observations in this study ; therefore , we adopt @xmath32 = 14 .",
    "most of the cores appear slightly elongated in the contour maps ( figures [ contfig][contend ] ) .",
    "this is likely an effect of chopping during observations as the maps are usually elongated along the chop direction .",
    "the chop direction is indicated on the maps with an arrow .",
    "however , some of the sources have extended asymmetrical emission at 350  distinct from the chopping asymmetry with an intensity of a few @xmath35 ( e.g. , on2s , g40.50@xmath312.54 ) .",
    "some ( 14% ) of the maps have double or multiple peaks , indicating the presence of more than one luminosity source .",
    "these sources are noted in table [ obstab ] .",
    "a few have close embedded double peaks ( e.g. , g23.95@xmath310.16 , s235 ) , while others show more spatially - distinct peaks .",
    "for example , the ngc 7538 region shows 3 distinct peaks in figure [ contend ] ; these were mapped separately , but are plotted in their relative locations .",
    "the contour maps also show that the 350  dust peak is often nearly coincident with the water maser position at the center of the map .",
    "thirty cores ( 59% ) have the dust centroid within @xmath61 of the maser position ( see table [ obstab ] ) .",
    "the mean absolute distance of the dust centroid to the maser position is 8 .",
    "about half of the 22 known  regions in the sample are also close ( @xmath62 ) to the maser , however , the mean absolute distance of the  position from the water maser is 10 .",
    "this separation is similar to that of the  region from the dust peak with mean absolute distance of 11 .",
    "samples based on water masers favor an earlier phase of star formation than  region samples ( cesaroni et al .",
    "1988 , shirley et al .",
    "the high coincidence of the dust centroid and maser position in these regions implies that the dust emission may be primarily tracing the earlier stages as well .    the fwhm size of each source , @xmath63 ,",
    "was determined by deconvolving the telescope main beam from the observed fwhm of the core by subtracting @xmath32 from the observed fwhm in quadrature .",
    "the observed fwhm was determined from the radial profile of each source .",
    "the deconvolved half - power radius is defined to be @xmath64 , where @xmath42 is the distance to the source . for the entire sample , @xmath65 pc , with a median of 0.14 pc .",
    "figure [ rfig ] shows the distribution of .",
    "photometry from the literature is collected in table [ sedtab ] .",
    "the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) was used to calculate the bolometric luminosity , , for each source , using only data taken with beam sizes @xmath66 20 , with the exception of the endpoints to the sed .",
    "luminosities range over three orders of magnitude , about 10@xmath67 to 10@xmath68  with @xmath69  and a median @xmath70 .",
    "if all the luminosity is attributed to a single star , the range of spectral types would be b3 to o4 , with the median being an o9 star .",
    "considering multiple sources and accretion luminosity would lower these spectral types .",
    "many recent studies have used power laws to fit directly the radial intensity profiles and infer the density structure of star forming regions ( e.g. , shirley et al .",
    "2000 , beuther et al .",
    "we did not use this technique ; however , for comparison purposes , we describe some general trends in the radial profiles of our sample .",
    "generally , the radial profiles follow a power law from about 12  ( approximately @xmath32 ) to 40 .",
    "the profiles are flattened toward the interior , and beyond 40 , they sometimes deviate from the power law .",
    "the flattening at small angles is likely due to beam effects , but could also result from fragmentation of the core .",
    "the change in the slope beyond 40  is not consistently steeper or shallower .",
    "some radial profiles are distorted by the presence of multiple peaks .",
    "one of the major motivations for this study was to learn what density distributions fit the data .",
    "a power law density distribution was assumed of the form @xmath71 , for @xmath2 in a range of 0.5 to 2.5 .",
    "we chose @xmath72 au for convenient comparison to other studies , but this @xmath73 is well inside our beam .",
    "the values of @xmath74 should be taken only as indicative of likely mean densities as substructure is very likely on those scales .",
    "the observed radial intensity profiles and seds were modeled using a modified version of the one - dimensional dust continuum radiative transfer code by egan , leung , and spagna ( 1988 ) and an observation simulation code described by evans et al .",
    "the radiative transfer code calculates the radial temperature distribution , @xmath75 self - consistently for each input model of @xmath76 .",
    "we also included contributions from the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) to the temperature distribution at the edge of the cloud .",
    "figure [ tempfig ] shows that @xmath75 is approximately a power law . at small radii",
    ", @xmath75 deviates by rising more steeply towards the center than a strict power law .",
    "additionally , the isrf causes an upturn in @xmath75 at large radii ( about 1 pc for a 10@xmath77  source ) .",
    "the isrf makes a substantial contribution to the temperature profile in regions forming low mass stars where the internal luminosity is low ( shirley et al .  2002a , young et al .",
    "2002 ) but has little effect in regions forming massive stars because the temperature profile is dominated by the embedded source .",
    "while these sources may exist in regions of enhanced isrf , the effects on the models are negligible even in our least luminous sources ( @xmath78 ) unless the isrf is a factor of 10 stronger than the standard value ( see evans et al .",
    "2001 for a plot of the isrf ) . for a more typical source with @xmath79",
    ", the isrf field must be at least 200 times stronger to change the best fit @xmath2 by 0.25 .    for each of our models , the input density , @xmath74 ,",
    "was normalized so that the model flux at 350  matched our observations , given a dust opacity at 350 .",
    "dust opacities were adopted from column 5 of the table in ossenkopf and henning ( 1994 ; hereafter oh5 ) , which were calculated for coagulated dust grains with ice mantles .",
    "these dust opacities ( oh5 ) have been previously shown to match observations of massive star formation regions by van der tak et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) as well as low mass star forming regions ( evans et al .",
    "2001 , shirley et al .  2002a , young et al .",
    "we also considered opacities for grains without ice mantles taken from column 2 of ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ; oh2 ) because temperatures in regions with young stars may be high enough to destroy the mantles .",
    "the oh2 opacities are higher at @xmath80  ( @xmath81 at 700 ) , but lower at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the crossover point is near 350 , with @xmath82 at 350  ( see fig . 2 of evans et al .",
    "using oh2 opacities thus results in best fit @xmath74 lower by about 10% .",
    "using oh2 opacities also resulted in higher model fluxes at long wavelengths , but lower fluxes at short wavelengths . no difference was found in the best fit @xmath2 between the oh2 and oh5 opacities .    for each value of @xmath2 and @xmath74 ,",
    "other model input parameters were adjusted to fit the observed values .",
    "the temperature of the star was taken to be the value corresponding to a star with @xmath83 ( thompson 1984 ) . however , the results are very insensitive to the stellar temperature ( van der tak et al .",
    "the outer , @xmath84 , and inner , @xmath85 , radii for each source are based on the angular extent of the observed radial profile and the chopper throw .",
    "we set @xmath84 to be the sum of the chopper throw and twice the extent of the observed profile .",
    "in particular , @xmath84 is large enough to allow simulation of chopping .",
    "the inner model radius was taken to be @xmath84 divided by 1000 , so that it is small enough to be unresolved .",

    "the best fit values were found to be insensitive to both inner and outer radii ( see  4.1 , shirley et al .  2002a , young et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the observation simulation program uses the temperature distribution output from the radiative transfer code for the density model being tested .",
    "the code calculates observed fluxes and luminosities and generates a radial profile of normalized intensity .",
    "the model is convolved with the observed beam and chopping is simulated to produce a more realistic radial profile for comparison with observations . for our models , an average one - dimensional representation of the actual beam was used ( fig .",

    "the sensitivity of the model to the input internal luminosity was tested by decreasing and increasing the parameter by a factor of two . while changing the luminosity affected the model sed by increasing or decreasing the flux at certain wavelengths",

    "young et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found the same correlation for low mass cores where distance is not the same limiting factor as in this study . a source with a steeper density distribution ( higher @xmath2 ) naturally has a smaller size ( @xmath63 ) and will be less well resolved ( figure [ pfig](c ) ) .",
    "the luminosity to mass ratio , @xmath17 , is often used as a measure of the star formation rate per unit mass .",
    "most studies in our galaxy have used the mass of the entire molecular cloud , determined from co emission . the resulting average ( @xmath17 = 0.4 / ) is quite low ( bronfman et al .",
    "2000 ) . for molecular clouds that contain  regions ,",
    "the luminosity to mass ratio from co emission is an order of magnitude higher , @xmath17 = 4 /  ( mooney & solomon 1988 ) , but the dispersion is over 23 orders of magnitude ( evans 1991 ; mead , kutner , & evans 1990 ) . co emission traces the less dense gas of the entire molecular cloud , while the dust continuum emission at submillimeter  wavelengths measures the mass of very dense gas actually involved in star formation .",
    "we computed values of @xmath201 because @xmath176 could be obtained for the largest number of sources .",
    "figure [ mlm ] plots log(@xmath202 ) versus log ( ) . both  and  are proportional to the square of the distance , so the distance uncertainties are minimized in the ratio . the ratio and ,",
    "hence , the star formation rate per unit mass is constant over the entire mass range .",
    "the dispersion of log(/ ) is about one and a half orders of magnitude , which is significantly less than the 23 orders of magnitude when the mass is traced by co.    figure [ mlm ] also plots log ( ) versus log ( ) and shows that the luminosity to mass ratio traced in massive cores is significantly higher than the average @xmath17 in molecular clouds with  regions .",
    "figure [ lmhist ] shows the distribution of @xmath203 , which peaks near @xmath204 ; the median log(/ ) is also 2.0 . the mean value of the ratio is @xmath205 / , with a median value of 120 /.",
    "this @xmath206 is 30 times that derived from co for galactic molecular clouds containing  regions .",
    "clearly the star formation rate per unit mass of _ dense _ gas is much higher , indicating that the dense gas traced by submillimeter  emission is the location of massive star formation .",
    "the histogram of @xmath202 in figure [ lmhist ] shows that the distribution is strongly skewed .",
    "most sources have low ratios , but there is a tail of very high ratios , reaching up to 490 /.",
    "a few sources could be affected by confusion with multiple sources in the large  beam , resulting in a luminosity that is too high .",
    "this problem is difficult to avoid since  is often the only source of mid- to far - infrared fluxes .",
    "higher spatial resolution is needed to eliminate multiple source confusion in flux measurements .",
    "the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) that will fly later in the decade will be ideally suited to address this problem and fix the upper limit to @xmath17 for galactic sources .    the mean @xmath17 for the beuther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) sample ( @xmath207 / , sridharan et al .",
    "2002 ) is 7 times lower than in this study ( @xmath208 / ) .",
    "if we decrease their masses by a factor of four , putting them on the  oh5 scale \" , the values are in better agreement ( @xmath209 80 / ) . for sources with a distance ambiguity ,",
    "we assume their near distance , which may produce a downward bias in luminosities and masses .",
    "eliminating this bias by averaging only sources in their sample for which the distance is not ambiguous , gives a luminosity to mass ratio ( @xmath210 / ) that is consistent with the results of our study .",
    "however , sridharan et al .   (",
    "2002 ) report an @xmath17 significantly smaller than that of a sample of  regions ( hunter 1997 , hunter et al .",
    "they suggest that the cores in their sample are in a younger pre-  phase and that @xmath17 increases as the cores evolve and develop  regions ( sridharan et al .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) describe their sample as having  region far - infrared colors or thermal radio continuum emission . if we also convert the opacities used by hunter et al . to the oh5 scale ,",

    "the mean @xmath17 for the  regions studied by hunter ( 1997 ) and hunter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is higher , but the median is not inconsistent with the results of the work presented here for cores both with and without  regions .    in order to test the hypothesis that the luminosity to mass ratio increases as a massive star forming region develops an  region , we divided our sample and calculated @xmath202 for cores with and cores without  regions .",
    "we do not find the same disparity in @xmath17 between our two subsamples as between the results of sridharan et al .  and hunter ( 1997 & hunter et al .",
    "2000 ) . for the cores associated with  regions , @xmath212 ( with a median of 120 ) , which is lower than the mean of the sample of hunter and hunter et al . , but within the dispersions of the two samples .",
    "the mean ratio of the remaining cores that do not contain an  region is not significantly lower , @xmath213 with a median of 100 .",
    "however , in a cs study with a larger sample of which ours is a subset , shirley et al .",
    "( 2002b ) found that the median luminosity to virial mass ratio is more than a factor of two higher in cores with  regions than in cores without  regions .",
    "submillimeter wavelengths are becoming increasingly important in the the study of star formation in other galaxies , especially at high redshifts ( blain et al.2002 ) . a recent submillimeter survey measured the dust masses , @xmath214 , and far - infrared to submillimeter ( @xmath215 1 to 1000 ) luminosities , @xmath216 , of bright local _ iras _ galaxies ( dunne & eales 2001 ) .",
    "dust is often used as a tracer of mass for more distant sources as well ( e.g. , omont et al .",
    "2001 , calzetti et al .",
    "2000 , benford et al .",

    "the average @xmath140 of 29 k found in this study is substantially lower .",
    "if we compared the mass within , we found that @xmath140 was about 50 k , but when using the full extent , much cooler dust contributed substantially .",
    "the dust mass , @xmath214 , of galaxies is usually calculated in the same way as our @xmath138 ( equation ( [ misoeq ] ) ) .",
    "however , different opacities are used and only the mass of the dust is calculated , not the mass of gas and dust as with @xmath138 .    for high redshift ( @xmath217 4 ) quasars ,",

    "the luminosity to mass ratio for high redshift quasars is similar to the higher values in our sample , suggesting that starbursts form stars as if most of their molecular material acts like the most extreme regions forming massive stars in the milky way .",
    "however , starbursts might not be the only source of @xmath216 in distant quasars .",
    "omont et al .  (",
    "2002 ) suggest central active galactic nuclei as another source of dust heating . in that case",
    ", the star - forming @xmath17 would be smaller .",
    "we have presented dust continuum maps of 51 regions forming massive stars with a large range of sizes and masses , @xmath224 = 0.16 @xmath6 0.10 pc and @xmath225 = 2020 @xmath6 4410 .",
    "we find that the peak of the dust emission is more often coincident with the water maser position than the  region , implying that the dust may better trace the earlier stages of massive star formation .",
    "modeling a subset of 31 sources yielded a mean density index for power laws ( @xmath226 ) of @xmath15 = 1.8 @xmath6 0.4 .",
    "the dispersion is about twice the expected uncertainty for an individual source , suggesting some real dispersion among sources .",
    "the mean value for @xmath2 is incompatible with a logatropic sphere ( @xmath2 = 1 ) , but @xmath2 = 1.5 or 2 are possible .",
    "the mean value and variation in @xmath2 are similar to those found for low mass regions ( young et al .",
    "2002 ) .    for the modeled sources , integrated masses within two different fiducial radii were presented in addition to the isothermal masses .",
    "the mean mass within the 350  half - power radius ( ) is @xmath227 . for the larger , more physical radius where the density falls off to the ambient level ( @xmath131 ) , @xmath134 = 720 @xmath6 860 .",
    "the mean column density for the complete sample was found to be @xmath228 . however , because of the inverse dependency of mass on opacity , comparison with virial masses suggests that the masses and mean surface density could be about a factor of three larger .",
    "the density structure of massive star - forming cores was found to be consistent with beuther et al .",
    "the results were also consistent with van der tak et al .  ( 2000 ) when the difference in a gaussian and the observed beam profile was taken into account .",
    "our data also confirm some of the conclusions made by van der tak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with respect to possible evolutionary indicators .",
    "there is a trend of rising @xmath95 with increasing @xmath229 , suggesting that either of these quantities could be tracing evolution .",
