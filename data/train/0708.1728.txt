    "through lowering the unification of the forces from the gut scale to the weak scale , the fine tuning cancellation required due to heavy gauge bosons coupling to the higgs may be removed through lowering the planck scale ( @xmath0 ) , where gravity becomes strong , thereby increasing gravity s true strength . to maintain the perceived strength that we observe ,",
    "gravity is assumed to leave the ( 3 + 1 ) space - time dimensions of the standard model ( sm ) brane and propagate into the extra dimensions of the bulk , resulting in a reduced planck scale ( @xmath1 ) , the fundamental scale in space - time , with only the weaker projection of gravity being observable on the sm brane .",
    "+ large extra dimensions ( leds ) , proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add )  @xcite , consider the scenario in which the sm particles and gauge interactions are confined to the 3-brane which is embedded in a ( 3 + @xmath2 ) dimensional bulk , where @xmath2 are assumed compact to preserve newtonian gravity on a large scale .",
    "the compactification radius @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 .",
    "gravitons are able to propagate in the bulk , appearing as a tower of kaluza - klein @xmath5kk@xmath6 excited modes on the sm brane , and can be detected via virtual graviton exchange , leading to a modification in dilepton or diphoton cross section , or direct graviton emission detectable as single jets or photons with missing transverse energy .",
    "+ randall and sundrum  @xcite proposed an alternative solution with a single extra dimension with a non - euclidian ( ads ) warped metric with curvature @xmath7 extending between the planck brane , where gravity is localized , and the tev brane where the sm fields are localized .",
    "this metric leads to the graviton wave function being exponentially suppressed away from the brane along the extra dimension with a scale of order @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass . setting @xmath10  tev then produces the desired fundamental planck scale .",
    "gravitons are then free to propagate in the bulk and are detectable as kk modes on the tev brane .",
    "the lowest order of these kk modes @xmath11 is massless , thus a limit is put on @xmath12 , the mass of the first resonance .",
    "the cross section is modified by the term @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the sm term , @xmath15 the interference and @xmath16 the graviton terms , @xmath17 is the invariant dilepton or diphoton mass and @xmath18 is the scattering angle .",
    "several formalisms are used for the effective lagrangian ; grw  @xcite , hlz  @xcite and hewett  @xcite and accounted for through the dimensionless parameter @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 represents the cutoff required to keep the sum of kk states finite and is of the order @xmath1 . +",

    "two isolated electrons were required , with transverse energy @xmath23 > 25 gev and located in the central or forward regions of the calorimeter , with at least one electron in the central region .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum for both regions is shown in figure  [ fig : e_spectrum ] and is in agreement with the expected background .",
    "the effective planck scale limits for the three formalisms and lambda conventions ( @xmath24 ) are shown in table  [ fig : limits_ee ] .",
    "leds may be detected through gravitons which are produced recoiling against a quark or a gluon jet , resulting in a jet plus missing @xmath23 signature .",
    "this analysis  @xcite uses 368  @xmath22 of data , collected with a high @xmath23 single jet trigger with the highest @xmath23 jet in each event required to be in the central region of the detector . each reconstructed jet with",
    "@xmath23 > 20 gev is required to have matching reconstructed tracks whose sum @xmath25 corresponds to at least 10% of the jet @xmath23 and missing @xmath23 > 80 gev is asked for .",
    "a threshold of 150 gev is then placed on the leading jet to select the final events from the monojet candidate sample .",
    "figures  [ et1 ] and  [ met ] show the comparison of predicted events from sm mc and events seen in data , which are in agreement .",
    "based on the maximum possible number of observed signal events , limits are placed on @xmath26 , shown in table  [ tab : metlim ] , for k factors ( the expected ratio of cross sections at next to leading order and leading order ) of 1.0 and 1.3 .",
    "these can be related to limits on the radius of the extra dimensions via the expression @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , direct graviton emission may lead to a photon and missing @xmath23 signature . for this search",
    "one photon was required with @xmath23 > 55 gev and to be located in the central region of the detector .",
