    "in strongly coupled plasmas @xcite , the coulomb interaction energy between neighboring particles exceeds the kinetic energy , leading to non - binary collisions that display temporal and spatial correlations between past and future collision events .",
    "such ` non - markovian ' dynamics invalidates traditional theory for collision rates @xcite and calculation of transport coefficients @xcite and frustrates the formulation of a tractable kinetic theory .",
    "this challenging fundamental problem is also one of the major limitations to our ability to accurately model equilibration , transport , and equations of state of dense laboratory and astrophysical plasmas @xcite , which impacts the design of inertial - confinement - fusion experiments @xcite , stellar chronometry based on white dwarf stars @xcite , and models of planet formation @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been the principal recourse for obtaining a microscopic understanding of short - time collision dynamics in this regime @xcite , but direct comparison of results with experiment has not been possible .    in the experiments described here ,",
    "we isolate the effects of strong coupling on collisional processes by measuring the velocity autocorrelation function ( vaf ) for charges in a strongly coupled plasma .",
    "the vaf , a central quantity in the statistical physics of many - body systems , encodes the influence of correlated collision dynamics and system memory on individual particle trajectories @xcite , and it is defined as @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the velocity of particle @xmath2 , and brackets indicate an equilibrium , canonical - ensemble average .",
    "remarkably , we obtain this individual - particle quantity from measurement of the bulk relaxation of the average velocity of a tagged subpopulation of particles in an equilibrium plasma .",
    "this contrasts with measurements of macroscopic - particle vafs based on statistical sampling of individual trajectories , which is commonly used in studies of dusty - plasma kinetics @xcite and brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the vaf also provides information on transport processes since its time - integral yields the self - diffusion coefficient through the green - kubo relation , @xmath3 which describes the long - time mean - square displacement of a given particle through @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "our results provide the first experimental measurement of the vaf and of self diffusion in a three - dimensional strongly coupled plasma .",
    "these results are found to be consistent with md simulation to within the experimental uncertainty @xcite .",
    "measurements are performed on ions in an ultracold neutral plasma ( ucnp ) , which is formed by photoionizing a laser - cooled atomic gas @xcite . shortly after plasma creation , ions equilibrate in the strongly coupled regime with coulomb coupling parameter , @xmath5 as large as @xmath6 . here , @xmath7 is the temperature and @xmath8 is the density .",
    "electrons in the plasma provide a neutralizing background and static screening on the ionic time scale with a debye screening length @xmath9 .",
    "this makes ucnps a nearly ideal realization of a yukawa one - component plasma @xcite , a paradigm model of plasma and statistical physics in which particles interact through a pair - wise coulomb potential screened by a factor @xmath10 .",
    "ultracold plasmas are quiescent , near local equilibrium , and ` clean ' in the sense they are composed of a single ion species and free of strong background fields .",
    "strong coupling is obtained at relatively low density , which slows the dynamics and makes short - timescale processes ( compared to the inverse collision rate ) experimentally accessible .",
    "powerful diagnostics exist for dense laboratory plasmas . however , their interpretation is complicated by the transient and often non - equilibrium nature of the plasmas , and they do not provide model - independent information on the effects of particle correlations at short timescales .",
    "these include , for example , measurement of the dynamic structure factor with x - ray thomson - scattering @xcite and measurement of electrical conductivity using a variety of techniques @xcite .",
    "comprehensive studies of self diffusivity @xcite exist for strongly coupled dusty plasmas , but these systems are typically two - dimensional and therefore do not directly illuminate the kinetics of bulk , three - dimensional plasmas .",
    "we perform experiments on ultracold neutral plasmas @xcite , which are created by first laser - cooling @xmath11sr atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite .",
    "atoms are then photoionized with one photon from a narrow - band laser resonant with the principal @xmath12 transition at 461 nm and another photon from a tunable 10-ns , pulsed dye laser near 413 nm .",
    "the electron temperature ( @xmath13 ) in the plasma is determined by the excess photon energy above the ionization threshold , which can be tuned to set @xmath14k .",
    "ions initially have very little kinetic energy , but they possess an excess of coulomb potential energy , and they equilibrate on a microsecond timescale to a temperature @xmath15 , determined primarily by the plasma density @xcite .",
    "the ion equilibration process is called disorder - induced heating .    disorder - induced heating limits the ions to @xmath16 . to obtain measurements on more weakly coupled systems ( @xmath17 ) , the plasma is heated with ion acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "waves are excited by placing a grating ( 10 cycles / mm ) in the path of the ionization beam , which is then imaged onto the mot for greatest contrast to create a plasma with a striped density modulation .",
    "after sufficiently long time , the waves completely damp , heating the plasma and reducing @xmath18 .",
    "electrons provide a uniform screening background for the ions , with screening parameter @xmath19 in these experiments , for wigner - seitz radius @xmath20 .",
    "the plasma density distribution is gaussian in shape , @xmath21 , with initial size @xmath22 - 2 mm .",
    "however , due to electron pressure forces , the plasma expands with time dependence given by , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the expansion time @xcite .    , and from the -1/2 to + 1/2 spin state around @xmath25 with two counterpropating , circularly polarized laser beams detuned by @xmath26 rad / s from the @xmath27 transition of the strontium ion ( 421.7 nm ) .",

    "the appendix provides a proof that the normalized vaf @xmath32 is equivalent to the observable @xmath33 as long as the total system is near thermal equilibrium and if terms beyond 2^nd^ order in a hermite - gauss expansion of the initial x - velocity distribution function for the subgroup , @xmath34 , are negligible .",
    "as shown below , our experiment satisfies these conditions , which provides a new technique for measuring the vaf .",

    "@xmath113 ) is critical for obtaining accurate results .",
    "the behavior of the long - time tail of the vaf for a yukawa system has not been explored in detail for the regime of our experiment , and this is an important area for future study . for concreteness , we will assume a @xmath114 dependence which is well - established as @xmath115 for neutral simple fluids @xcite and is generally accepted as the slowest possible decay @xcite .",

    "the latter are scientifically interesting in their own right , such as the timescale for the approach to equilibrium of velocity correlations after plasma creation and the effect of plasma expansion on the microscopic dynamics .",
    "any complications caused by these systematics can be greatly reduced by performing measurements on a larger plasma for which the expansion time scale is much greater than the characteristic collisional timescale ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "other sources of uncertainty include variation of density across the analysis regions , the spread in bulk plasma velocity across and within regions , the time - evolving density , and the uncertainty in the density calibration .",
    "these uncertainties are reflected in the horizontal error bars in fig . @xmath129 and can be significantly reduced in future experiments .",
    "utilizing a spin - tagging technique to measure the average velocity @xmath131 of a subpopulation of ions in an ultracold neutral plasma , and taking advantage of an identification of the time evolution of this quantity with the normalized ion vaf @xmath100 , we have experimentally measured the vaf in a strongly coupled plasma . from this",
    "we have calculated the ion self - diffusion coefficient @xmath112 , which provides an experimental benchmark that has been lacking for molecular dynamics simulations of strongly coupled systems in three dimensions .",
    "the data also display a non - exponential decay of @xmath100 at early times , which has not previously been observed experimentally in a bulk plasma and is indicative of non - markovian collisional dynamics .",
    "this behavior is well described by a memory - function formalism .",
    "overall , these measurements experimentally validate foundational concepts describing how the buildup and decay of ion velocity correlations at the microscopic level determine the dynamics of strongly coupled systems at the macroscopic level , which can not be adequately described by simple analytical methods . because ultracold neutral plasmas offer a clean realization of the commonly used yukawa ocp model , these results are relevant for fundamental kinetic theory and other plasmas for which effects of strong coupling are important .",
    "we show that the quantity @xmath33 measured in these experiments corresponds to the normalized vaf @xmath132 if the initial velocity distribution for @xmath133 ions ( @xmath134 ) is maxwellian in @xmath135 and @xmath136 and well - described by a 2^nd^ order hermite - gauss expansion in @xmath137 , and the optical pumping prepares the subsystem of @xmath133 ions in a non - equilibrium state close to thermodynamics equilibrium .",
    "to prove this , we transform into the frame co - moving with any bulk hydrodynamic velocity of the ensemble , making @xmath138 , which does not invalidate any steps in the proof .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the plasma is spatially homogeneous in a volume @xmath139 , although the following arguments can be readily extended to account for non - uniform spatial distributions .",
    "finally , we assume that the optical pumping occurs instantaneously at some initial time @xmath140 .",
    "let us consider a specified + 1/2 ion labeled `` s '' with position @xmath141 and velocity @xmath142 at time @xmath79 ; for a statistical description of the dynamics , it is useful to define the microscopic phase space density is @xmath143 and its statistical average @xmath144 . before optical pumping , for @xmath145 ,",
    "the system is in thermal equilibrium and @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution . after pumping , the * * sub**system is out of thermal equilibrium , @xmath148 we assume @xmath149 , so that @xmath150 satisfies @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the propagator , or retarded green s function , of the equation that governs the temporal evolution of @xmath150 , which is obtained by linearizing the exact evolution equation satisfied by @xmath153 .",
    "remarkably , the propagator @xmath154 , which describes the non - equilibrium dynamics of the system , is related simply to the equilibrium time - correlation function @xmath155 as follows @xmath156 where , in the last equality , we used the initial value @xmath157 .",
    "this relation is an expression of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .    from eq.([deltaf ] ) , the average particle velocity along the x - direction determined in our experiment is @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
