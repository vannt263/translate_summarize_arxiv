    "particle physics at the turn of the millennium faces two key mysteries : the origin of mass and the existence of multiple fermion generations .",
    "while the former mystery may be resolved by the lhc , the latter appears to originate at higher mass scales , which can be studied only indirectly .",
    "such effects as _ cp _  violation , mixing , and flavor - changing neutral or lepton - number - violating currents may hold the key to physics at these new scales  @xcite . because in the charm sector the standard model ( sm ) contributions to these effects are small , these are areas in which charm studies can provide unique information .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath4- and @xmath5-quark sectors , in which such studies are typically pursued , there are large sm contributions to mixing and _ cp _",
    "violation  @xcite , which for new - physics searches constitute backgrounds .",
    "both direct and indirect _ cp _",
    "violation are possible in charm decay .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) predicts direct _ cp _",
    "violation in singly cabibbo - suppressed ( scs ) charm decays at the @xmath6 level  @xcite , arising from the interference of tree - level processes with penguins ( fig .",
    "[ fig : penguin ] ) .",
    "the observation of _ cp _  asymmetries substantially larger than this would be unambiguous evidence for new physics , as would almost any observation of direct _ cp _  violation in cabibbo - favored ( cf ) or doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) charm decays . the experimental signature for direct _ cp _  violation is a difference in partial decay rates between particle and antiparticle : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are _",
    "cp_-conjugate final states or ( for _ cp _  eigenstates ) @xmath10 . in the latter case",
    "the two processes of eq .",
    "[ eq : direct ] are distinguished by initial - state tagging ( @xmath11 ) , while in the former case the final states are  self - tagging .",
    "\" rates observed in the self - tagging modes typically need to be corrected for production - rate or detection - efficiency asymmetries between particle and antiparticle , hence what is reported is usually an asymmetry normalized to that in a cf mode .    indirect charm _",
    "violation can arise through the interference of dcs and mixing amplitudes , _",

    "[ eq : mixing ] the first term on the right - hand side is the dcs contribution , which peaks at @xmath14 ; the second is the mixing contribution , which peaks at two @xmath12 lifetimes due to the factor @xmath15 ; and the third term reflects interference between mixing and dcs decay and peaks at one lifetime due to the factor @xmath16 .",
    "given the small values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the @xmath12  @xcite , the interference term ( which is linear in @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) may be more easily detectable than the pure mixing term .",
    "_ cp _  is violated if @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the dcs amplitude for @xmath12 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "a variety of extensions of the standard model have been considered  @xcite in which charm _",
    "cp _  asymmetries could be as large as @xmath23 .",
    "these include models with leptoquarks  @xcite , extra higgs doublets ( _ e.g._non - minimal supersymmetry  @xcite ) , a fourth generation  @xcite , or right - handed weak currents  @xcite .",
    "in addition , two standard model possibilities for large _ cp _  asymmetries in charm have been discussed : asymmetries due to @xmath24 mixing in _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath25  @xcite , and the intriguing possibility that @xmath3 mesons mix with glueballs or gluonic hybrids  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental hints  @xcite that @xmath12 mixing may be on the verge of detection have led to renewed interest in this physics  @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation is that both cleo and focus have observed effects at the @xmath262@xmath27 level : cleo measures @xmath28% ( for their most general fit )  @xcite , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the strong phase between the dcs and cf amplitudes ; and focus obtains  @xcite @xmath33% .",
    "( these results , while superficially contradictory , can be reconciled for a range of possible choices of @xmath32 ; whether such large @xmath32 is theoretically plausible is a subject of current debate  @xcite . )",
    "current sensitivities to charm _ cp _  violation are summarized in table  [ tab : cplimits ] .",
    "these are based on samples of up to @xmath34 reconstructed charm decays obtained in the cleo and focus experiments .",
    "the @xmath35 factories can be expected to obtain samples an order of magnitude larger than these , which should push _",
    "cp_-violation limits down to the one - to - few-% level , and the compass experiment at cern may also be competitive at this level  @xcite .    [",

    "cp _  asymmetries ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     other experiments that could potentially extend charm _ cp_-violation sensitivity include hera-@xmath35 , lhc@xmath5 , and btev .",
    "hera-@xmath35 has operated so far in a mode in which charm decays are efficiently rejected by the trigger , and a significant upgrade of their daq bandwidth would be required in order to record a substantial sample of hadronic charm decays .",
    "similarly , lhc@xmath5 is designed to reject charm at trigger level in order to concentrate on beauty .",
    "btev is an approved fermilab experiment that will use the tevatron collider to study heavy - quark physics .",
    "btev data - taking is planned to commence in tevatron run iib ( starting about 2006 ) . to achieve the highest possible sensitivity to mixing , _ cp _ violation , and rare decays in charm as well as beauty , a very ambitious trigger system",
    "is envisioned that will examine _ every _ beam crossing for evidence of secondary vertices  @xcite . to do this",
    "it will make use of information from a unique , high - speed , silicon - pixel vertex detector  @xcite located inside the dipole spectrometer magnet ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : btev ] ) .",
    "the design goal for this trigger is an efficiency better than 50% for @xmath35 events of interest .",
    "triggering on decay vertices is more difficult for charm than for beauty , since charm lifetimes are shorter and the typical transverse momenta of charm decay products ( important for vertex resolution ) are lower .",
    "[ fig : charmfig ] shows the results of a geant simulation of the btev apparatus , indicating about 1% efficiency for the decay chain @xmath36 , including geometric acceptance , trigger efficiency , and offline reconstruction efficiency .",
    "( the vertex trigger efficiency is here assumed to be about 10% , based on previous simulation results  @xcite , but this needs to be rechecked in light of the recent evolution of our vertex trigger algorithm  @xcite . )    since _ cp_-violation sensitivity depends in complicated ways on reconstruction and particle - id efficiency for various modes , optimization of vertex cuts , @xmath37-tagging efficiency ( for @xmath12 modes ) , etc .",
    ", we use here simple overall benchmarks rather than detailed estimates .",
    "these are the total number of charm decays produced or reconstructed and the total number of @xmath38 decays produced or reconstructed .",
    "we scale from current experiments according to the square root of one of these benchmark numbers to obtain an estimated _ cp _  reach , recognizing that this procedure is at best approximate and addresses only the statistical component of _ cp _  sensitivity .",
    "these estimates suggest that btev is likely to reconstruct about @xmath39 such events per year , or @xmath40-event overall charm sensitivity summing over all modes .",
    "future simulation work should allow more detailed btev charm sensitivity estimates , including both statistical and systematic effects .",
    "however , at the present level of understanding , sensitivity below the @xmath41 level looks possible in btev , thus even charm _ cp _  asymmetries at the standard model level may be detectable .",
    "btev running might be staged , with wire - target running (  l hera-@xmath35 ) in the years before a high - luminosity @xmath42 interaction region can be provided for us . although collider running is required for competitive beauty sensitivity , charm sensitivity may be comparable in fixed - target and collider modes .",
    "unique among near - term heavy - quark hadroproduction experiments , btev will have substantial and broad sensitivity to charm events and should be the leading charm experiment in the latter half of this decade .",
