    "the fastest red - shifted component comes 10 s later at 01:37:43 , and it is centered at location 2 , which is closer to the surface of the sun by about 3.3  than location 1 . the spectrum of the si iv 1393.73   line at both location 1 and location 2 at this time are shown in the middle row of figure [ iris_redshift.fig ] .",
    "the highly red - shifted component at location 2 has a speed of 197 km s@xmath0 . at location 1 , the same location where the highly redshifted component was 10 seconds previously , the si iv consists of a single component gaussian with a red shift of about 58 km s@xmath0 , similar to velocities seen at that location prior to the eruption .",
    "the high - speed component at location 2 has a non - thermal width of 23 km s@xmath0 , while the slower component at location 1 has a non - thermal width of 43 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the bottom row of figure [ iris_redshift.fig ] shows the si iv spectrum from location 1 at 01:37:53 ut .",
    "at this time there are clearly again two components to the profile , and we use a double gaussian function to fit the spectral profile .",

    "since the coronal rain is not visible in the 171   channel like it is in the _ iris _ sji images and the aia 304   images , we use this channel to determine the plane - of - sky velocity of the flows associated with the eruption .    to measure the plane - of - sky velocity from aia 171   images ,",

    "emission along the slice as it evolves in time , taken from row averages within the dashed contour , is shown in figure [ aia-velocity.fig]c .",
    "each column represents an individual base - difference ( background - subtracted ) image taken after 01:33 ut .",
    "see the online material for a corresponding movie .",
    "the leading edge of this space - time plot is extracted using the canny edge detection algorithm @xcite and fit with a line , the slope of which gives the velocity along the arc .",
    "the parameters of the edge detection are varied to obtain the three linear fits shown in figure [ aia-velocity.fig]c , which indicate a plane - of - sky velocity of 300 @xmath17 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the location of the _ iris _ slit is indicated in figure [ aia-velocity.fig ] by a dashed line , and the locations of the fast _ iris _ flows are marked with a cross and a circle , as in figure [ iris_redshift.fig ] .",
    "both of the fast _ iris _ flows occur on the edge of the bright material that constitutes the flow in the aia 171   channel , with the more non - thermally broadened flow ( circle ) on the edge towards the external field and the less non - thermally broadened flow ( cross ) on the edge towards the erupting filament .",
    "reconnection of magnetic fields often includes heating of the plasma as part of the energy release . in order to determine how the thermal energy in the plasma changes as a result of the erupting prominence , we calculate differential emission measures ( dems ) at a few key locations during the eruption .    to calculate the dems",
    ", we use the algorithm xrt_dem_iterative2 , written by mark weber @xcite , which is available in the ssw database .",
    "this algorithm works by adjusting a series of spline knots in the dem solution until the @xmath18 between the measured and calculated intensities is minimized .",
    "the algorithm has been shown to do a good job at reproducing model dems ( see the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have shown that xrt_dem_iterative2 provides solutions that are in good agreement with the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method developed by @xcite , and @xcite have similarly found good agreement with their regularized inversion dem method .",
    "errors on the dems are determined by performing 100 monte carlo simulations , where each monte carlo solution is a dem calculated using the measured intensities varied by a normally distributed random error .",
    "dems are calculated using all six fe - dominated aia euv channels and , when available , the xrt be - thin , be - med , al - med and al - thick filters .",
    "we do not use the xrt al - poly and c - poly filters in the dems because they are more susceptible to contamination issues @xcite .",
    "the temperature response functions for the two telescopes used in the dem calculations are from the latest versions currently available . for aia ,",
    "the temperature responses used are version 6 from the aia_get_reponse program , using the `` chiantifix , '' `` evenorm '' and `` noblend '' keywords .",
    "the `` chiantifix '' keyword applies an empirical correction to the aia 94   response function to account for missing lines in the chianti spectral package , and the `` evenorm '' keyword normalizes the aia temperature responses to the output of the euv variability experiment ( eve ) on _ sdo _ @xcite .",
    "the `` noblend '' keyword removes the blending of the 131   and the 335   channels in the response functions , which has been previously found to provide better fits to dem data @xcite . for xrt ,",
    "the temperature responses are calculated with the calibrations outlined in @xcite and using the same solar spectrum as is used for the aia response functions .",
    "for both telescopes , we use the date - dependent versions of the temperature response functions , which account for any loss in sensitivity of the instrumentation as a function of time .",
    "we first calculate dems at locations where iris observes fast line - of - sight flows at 01:37:43 ut ( see figure [ iris_redshift.fig ] ) .",
    "these dems are shown in figure [ dem_outflows.fig ] , and they are calculated by averaging the pixels in the white boxes .",
    "the positions of the iris fast flows are demarkated by a cross and a circle , as in previous figures .",
    "the dems for both locations have a peak at about log t = 6.4 ( 2.5 mk ) .",
    "the dem for location 2 has a long tail at higher temperatures , while the dem for location 1 falls off rapidly .",
    "the monte carlo simulations show that for both of the dems , the peak is fairly certain , but there is a wide range of possible values surrounding the high - temperatures , making it difficult to say with certainty if there is a high - temperature component to the plasma in either case .",
    "unfortunately there are no xrt data at this time , which would help to constrain the higher temperatures .",
    "a few minutes later , at 01:39:35 ut , there is a brightening observed in the aia 131   intensity at the location where the flows in aia originate ( marked with the letter ` d , ' in the third row of figure [ summary.fig ] ) , without a corresponding brightening in the 171   channel . because of the hot component in the 131   response function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for thorough discussions of the aia temperature response functions ) , this difference is often an indication that hot ( @xmath110 mk ) plasma is present .",
    "figure [ dem_small_loop.fig ] shows aia 94 , 131 and 171   images and a dem at around 01:39 ut , when the aforementioned intensity enhancement is just starting to appear in the 94 and 131   channels ( see the on - line movie accompanying figure [ summary.fig ] ) .",
    "the dem is calculated using intensities averaged over the white box plotted on the images .",
    "there are no xrt data for this time , so only the six fe - dominated aia euv filters are used in calculating the dems .",
    "figure [ dem_small_loop.fig ] also shows the dem for a corresponding box at 00:58 ut , prior to the eruption .",
    "we choose this time because there is a full set of xrt filters available , which are used in addition to the aia filters to calculate the dem .",
    "the dem at 01:39 ut has two components , a low - temperature component that peaks at about log t = 6.3 ( 2 mk ) and a high - temperature component that peaks at around log t = 7.0 ( 10 mk ) .",
    "the dem calculated for the time before the eruption does not show a similar high temperature component within the margin of error provided by the monte carlo runs .",
    "after the eruption , at 02:03 ut , there is a large loop seen in xrt images that does not exist before the eruption , as shown in figure [ xrt_summary.fig ] , indicating that some heating has taken place on this loop as well .",
    "figure [ dem_big_loop.fig ] shows xrt / be - thin , aia/94 , and aia/131   images and a dem for 02:07 ut , a time after the eruption when a full set of xrt images is available . during this time , the large loop that extends southward of the erupting loop that is shown in figure [ xrt_summary.fig ] is still clearly visible in the xrt images .",
    "the only aia filter where the loop is visible is the 94   channel .",
    "it is not visible in either the 335   channel ( not shown ) or the 131   channel .    as in figure",
    "[ dem_small_loop.fig ] , the dem is calculated using averaged intensities in the white box .",
    "we show a dem from near the loop top , but dems from other locations are similar .",
    "the dem from 02:07 shows a dominant component peaked at log t = 6.4 ( 2.5 mk ) , but it also has a broad wing at higher temperatures .",
    "this wing is not present in the pre - eruption dem calculated at the same location , also shown in figure [ dem_big_loop.fig ] .",
    "if we fit a double - gaussian function to the dem , we find that the wing is caused by a weak component peaked at about log t = 6.6 ( 4 mk ) .",
    "this secondary component provides an explanation for why the big loop is weakly visible in the 94   channel , but not the 335   or the 131   channels .",
    "the peak temperature of log t = 6.6 is in a region of the 131   response function where there is very little sensitivity .",
    "the 335   response function is sensitive to plasma at log t = 6.6 but is much more sensitive to plasma at the temperature of the dominant component of the dem , log t = 6.4 , so the background corona is likely making it difficult to see the big loop in this filter .",
    "the 94   temperature response reaches a minimum right around log t = 6.4 , so the background corona does not contribute very much at all to the emission in this filter , thus it is able to weakly image the hotter component .",
    "the images in figure [ dem_big_loop.fig ] also show the value of the xrt instrument in identifying hot plasma , since the big loop is clearly identified in the xrt image but only very faintly seen in one of the aia filters .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the _ iris _ slit jaw imager allows us to examine the initiation of the eruption in unprecedented detail .",
    "figure [ triggering.fig ] shows the initiation of the eruption in the _ iris _ 1330   sji as well as the aia 304  , 171  , and 131   channels . the first indication that the prominence is destabilizing in iris",
    "is the brightening of an elongated structure at 01:25:43 ut , indicated by a box in the top row of figure [ triggering.fig ] .",
    "there is no indication of a brightening in the aia 304   or 171   images at this time , and only a very weak brightening is seen in the center of the absorbing prominence material in the aia 131  image .",
    "a few minutes later , at 01:28:38 ut , the bright structure seen in iris futher stretches to the southwest . at this time",
    ", there is still no obvious counterpart to this structure in the aia 304   image , but both the aia 171   and 131   images show a bright dot at the center of the absorptive material of the prominence , formed at the same time as the elongation of the bright feature in the _ iris _ sji image . over the next minute",
    ", the elongated feature in the _ iris _ images splits in two , and the bright dot in the aia images moves to the southwest in the images .",
    "after this splitting , the prominence starts elongating in the same direction as the motion of the bright dot ( see the online animation that accompanies figure [ triggering.fig ] ) .",
    "the next phase of the eruption initiation involves the overlying material .",
    "tendrils of material from the overlying coronal rain structure can be seen interacting with the prominence in the _ iris _ sji images as early as 01:30:54 ut . in figure [ triggering.fig ] , we show images from 01:32:32 ut in _ iris _ , where the tendrils are very clear .",
    "the tendrils connect to a brightening on the north side of the prominence that also appears in the aia channels .",
    "the tendrils are also visible in the aia 304   image , but because of the lower spatial resolution , the connections between the tendrils and the brightening are not as clear as they are in the _ iris _ images .",
    "the tendrils are not visible at all in the aia 171   and 131   images .",
    "the bottom row of figure [ triggering.fig ] shows the early stages of the eruption at 01:36:25 ut .",
    "the brightening seen previously at 01:32:32 ut has elongated , and at the end of the elongated bright structure there is a round ball of plasma that could be the erupting flux rope .",
    "this structure is reminiscent of a flux rope and current sheet - like structure observed previously in the aia 131   channel during the well - studied eruption on 3 november 2010 @xcite , although the plasma imaged here is much cooler , and the spatial extent of the eruption is smaller .",
    "because of the pre - existing structure that contains the coronal rain , it is tempting to look for signs of break - out reconnection , where the reconnection that triggers the eruption happens above the prominence ( i.e. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as was observed in a recent eruption studied by @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , the observational features that can be linked to the eruption trigger seem not to occur above the prominence .",
    "the separation of the elongated structure seen in the _ iris _ images between 01:28:38 ut and 01:29:37 ut could be due to reconnecting field lines separating the feature into two domains along the prominence .",
    "similarly , though the interaction with the tendrils of coronal rain does involve an overlying structure , the tendrils interact with the prominence itself low down , below the ball of material that perhaps constitutes an erupting flux rope .",
    "this mechanism is consistent with some form of tether - cutting trigger ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .        since many eruptions have a slow rise phase followed by a faster eruptive phase ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we analyze the kinematics of the eruption in order to better understand the role of the brightenings shown in figure [ triggering.fig ] .",
    "we trace the leading edge of the prominence to infer its bulk motion using a process similar to that described in  [ aia_flows ] .",
    "the data are first aligned using cross correlation to mitigate an orbital pointing wobble .",
    "a linear slice is then chosen to track the eruption using part of the prominence that is relatively free of flows that do not reflect the bulk outward motion , namely those visible at the southern extent .",
    "this slice is shown in panel a of figure  [ fig : height_time ] and is perpendicular to the limb with a width of two pixels .",
    "emission along the slice at a given time is stacked against subsequent observations to produce the height - time profile in panel b , which is processed using the canny edge detection algorithm to extract the leading edge .",
    "pixels returned by the edge detection serve as our individual height measurements and are fit with the analytic approximation presented by @xcite for their study of an active region flux rope eruption :    @xmath19    @xmath20 is height , @xmath21 is time , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are free parameters .",
    "this model combines a linear equation to treat the slow - rise phase and an exponential to treat the fast - rise .",
    "the onset of the fast - rise phase can be defined as the point at which the exponential component of the velocity equals the linear , which occurs at :    @xmath27    fitting is accomplished using mpfit , a non - linear least squares curve fitting package for idl @xcite .",
    "recently , we have used this method to examine the kinematics of 106 events observed by aia @xcite , and more detail on this method can be found in that work .    using the above method",
    ", we find that the slow - rise phase lasts for @xmath11.2 hours , beginning with an apparent velocity of 0.40 @xmath28 0.05 km s@xmath0 before reaching twice that at @xmath29 . because this velocity is so slow ,",
    "we examine the effect of solar rotation , and find that up to half of the apparent velocity can be attributed to line of sight effects from the rotation of the prominence towards the limb , rather than an actual rise of the prominence above the solar surface .",
    "after @xmath29 , a rapid acceleration brings the final velocity to 250 @xmath28 8 km s@xmath0 over @xmath115 minutes .",
    "we find the fast - rise onset time to be 01:25 ut @xmath28 30s at a height of 7.3 @xmath28 0.9 mm above the limb .",
    "this time is very close to the time that the first brightenings are seen in the iris 1330   sji , as shown in figure [ triggering.fig ] .",
    "subsequent brightenings seen in iris and detailed in figure [ triggering.fig ] occur during the ramp up of the fast rise phase , and their times are marked with dotted lines in figure [ fig : height_time ] .",
    "taken as a whole , we interpret our observations to be evidence that reconnection is occurring between the prominence magnetic field and the the overlying magnetic field as the eruption takes place .",
    "an illustration of the suggested magnetic field configuration is presented in the cartoon shown in figure [ cartoon.fig ] . additionally , we conclude that the reconnection is triggered not by break - out reconnection , but by reconnection occurring along and underneath the prominence .",
    "the observational elements that lead us to these conclusions are as follows :    1 .   the kinked morphology of the overlying plasma as the eruption occurs , as seen in the _ iris _ sji image in the second row of figure [ summary.fig ] .",
    "2 .   the fast flows observed in both the _ iris _ si iv line ( figure [ iris_redshift.fig ] ) and the aia 171   images ( figure [ aia-velocity.fig ] ) .",
    "3 .   heating that occurs at the location of the kinked structure ( which is itself the origin of the fast flows seen in aia ) , as evidenced by hot plasma appearing in the aia 131   channel and the xrt be - thin filter ( figures [ dem_small_loop.fig ] and [ dem_big_loop.fig ] ) .",
    "4 .   the eruption has a very slow initial rise phase ( @xmath10.4 km s@xmath0 ) that transitions into a very rapid acceleration and eruption with a final velocity of @xmath1250 km s@xmath0 ( figure [ fig : height_time ] ) .",
    "high spatial resolution _ iris _ sji images show brightenings at the time of the transition between the slow and fast rise phases , indicating possible locations for reconnections that trigger and drive the fast part of the eruption ( figure [ triggering.fig ] ) .",
    "a cartoon showing the suggested magnetic configuration during the eruption . examination of the iris sji images indicates that the reconnection below the prominence occurs before the reconnection above the prominence ( see figure [ triggering.fig ] ) . ]",
    "the line - of - sight fast flows we observe in _ iris _ using the doppler shift of the _ iris _ si iv 393.73   line are intermittent , appearing and disappearing over the course of tens of seconds . on the other hand ,",
    "the flow seen in the aia 171   images is fairly steady .",
    "we interpret the intermittency in the _ iris _ fast flows as being due to pre - existing cool material becoming entrained in the hotter fast reconnection flow seen in aia .",
    "the fast line - of - sight flows observed in _ iris _ spectra range from 112",
    " 197 km s@xmath0 , and the plane - of - sky flows observed in the aia 171   channel are about 300 km s@xmath0 , giving a total velocity of 320  360 km s@xmath0 .",
    "other observations have found similar numbers for reconnection outflows .",
    "@xcite found outflows of 200 - 400 km s@xmath0 in a small b9.5 flare observed with the extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on _ hinode_. recently , @xcite found redshifts in the _ iris _ fe xxi line indicating reconnection outflows with speeds up to @xmath1 300 km s@xmath0 along the line of sight .",
    "supra - arcade downflows , thought to be related to reconnection outflows , typically have speeds on the order of several hundreds of km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the pre - existing coronal rain in the area of the eruption has speeds of 65 km s@xmath0 and non - thermal widths of about 36 km s@xmath0 .",
    "since the average non - thermal width of the si iv line in the quiet sun is about 20 km s@xmath0 @xcite , these numbers indicate that the plasma in the overlying dome structure is dynamic and possibly turbulent even before the eruption . during the eruption ,",
    "the non - thermal widths get even higher , into the 50 km s@xmath0 range at location 1 , which is on the edge of the outflow that faces the overlying field .",
    "interestingly , the non - thermal width on the edge of the flow away from the overlying field ( location 2 ) has a very narrow non - thermal width of 23 km s@xmath0 , on par with quiet sun values .",
    "the difference in the non - thermal widths on different edges of the outflow could indicate small - scale plasmoid formation at the current sheet interface between the overlying field and the prominence field ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or it could be indicitave of higher pressure underneath the dome structure , which would lead to compression that would impede the flow and narrow the line widths , as was seen by @xcite .",
    "we find that at the locations of the fast flows observed by iris and aia , there is a strong component of the dems at about 2.5 mk , about the same temperature as the background corona .",
    "the dems indicate that there may be a small amount of hotter plasma as well , but the evidence is not definitive .",
    "there is also a cool component to the fast flows , since they are visible intermittantly in the iris si iv line .",
    "this result seems surprising , since the reconnection process should heat the plasma as well as accelerating it .",
    "however , if the magnetic field of the prominence is rotated with respect to the overlying field , a rotational discontinuity would form as the two fields reconnect .",
    "the thermal properties remain constant across a rotational discontinuty , converting magnetic energy into purely kinetic energy @xcite , which could explain the fast flows that do not appear to be heated early in the eruption .",
    "simulations of reconnection in skewed magnetic fields that include conduction show that the rotational discontinuity is followed by a slow shock that heats the plasma on timescales on the order of minutes @xcite .",
    "we do see clear evidence for heating at the reconnection site , given the emission that is seen in the aia 131   channel a few minutes after the flows are observed .",
    "unfortunately , the _ iris _ slit is not coincident with this location , so it is difficult to determine if this heating is due to shocks or not .",
    "the height - time plot in figure [ fig : height_time ] shows that the prominence undergoes a very slow rise phase with an apparent velocity of about 0.4 km s@xmath0 , and the actual rise velocity during this phase could be somewhat lower due to line - of - sight effects .",
    "this velocity is much slower than the typical slow rise phase velocity of an active region filament , which is usually on the order of 2 - 25 km s@xmath0 @xcite , although filaments in the quiet sun and polar crown filaments sometimes show slow rise velocities on the order of 1 km s@xmath0 or less @xcite .",
    "the only observation we are aware of with such a slow rise phase velocity in an active region filament is from work by @xcite , who observe a three - stage filament eruption that starts with a very slow rise phase of 0.1 km s@xmath0 , followed by a slow rise of 1 km s@xmath0 , and then finally culminates in the rapid acceleration of the filament .",
    "active region eruptions often exhibit no slow - rise phase at all and may instead be fit with a single exponential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these events may have slow - rise phases that are simply not perceptible by the instrument resolution or analysis technique .",
    "the fact that we can see such a small slow - rise velocity in such a small structure may be attributable to the fine spatial resolution of iris .",
    "some possible mechanisms for the slow rise phase are flux cancellation that forms the filament and increases its twist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or emergence of the flux rope from beneath the photosphere @xcite , though because this filament is on the limb , it is difficult to say which of these mechanisms might be occuring .",
    "the high spatial resolution images from the _ iris _ slit jaw imager allow us to examine the triggering of the fast rise in great detail .",
    "we find that there is a brightening in iris at about the same time as our calculated switch over time from the slow rise phase to the fast rise phase . a very faint indication of this feature is seen in the aia 131   image , but there is no sign of it in the 171   image until a few minutes later , when a bright dot appears in the center of the prominence .",
    "tendrils of material associated with the overlying field are clearly seen in the iris images as the fast rise phase begins , and they seem to interact with the prominence , possibly contributing further to destabilizing it .",
    "similar features can be seen in the aia 304   channel , but it is difficult to follow their motion due to the lower spatial resolution .",
    "the coronal wavelengths ( i.e. 171 and 131  ) show completely different features during the eruption triggering that again are not entirely clear due to the spatial resolution .",
    "a high resolution euv telescope , similar to the one flown on the hi - c rocket @xcite , would be extremely beneficial for future studies of the triggering mechanisms in coronal mass ejections .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for thoughtful comments that improved this paper , and patrick antolin , ed deluca , wei liu , nick murphy , and xudong sun for helpful discussions .",
