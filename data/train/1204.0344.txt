    "the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics is usually stated and proved for systems with a finite spectral gap .",
    "mathematically it is known since at least 1998  @xcite that in a weaker sense the theorem remains valid even for systems without spectral gap as long as the spectral projections of the time - dependent hamiltonian are sufficiently regular functions of time , see also  @xcite .",
    "its validity has been shown even for resonances  @xcite and for open systems  @xcite . in recent years",
    "the problem of adiabaticity for gapless systems attracted also interest in physics .",
    "for example , in  @xcite the authors consider adiabatic changes in the coupling of a scalar field . in a finite volume",
    "the ground state of the field is separated by a gap from the excited states . however , in the thermodynamic limit the gap closes and the spectrum of the field becomes absolutely continuous .",
    "the authors find that in the thermodynamic limit the error in the adiabatic approximation depends on the spatial dimension and other parameters controlling the spectral density of the field .",
    "they distinguish three regimes : one where the adiabatic theorem holds with the same error estimate as in the gapped case , one where it holds with a different power law and one where it fails completely . in all cases",
    ", however , they identify the error of the adiabatic approximation with the size of the non - adiabatic transitions . one main goal of our paper is to explain why this is , in general , not a valid identification and why the concept of super - adiabatic approximations is useful also in the gapless case .    to this end",
    "we consider a specific gapless model in the adiabatic limit , namely a massless scalar field with time dependent sources . the goal is to exhibit a number of subtleties in adiabatic theory that are known in the gapped case  but often not expressed sufficiently clearly  also for the case of gapless systems .",
    "in particular we emphasize the difference between the error in the adiabatic approximation and what physically should be considered non - adiabatic transitions . to be more specific , let us briefly recall the situation in the presence of a spectral gap .",
    "let @xmath0 be a time - dependent hamiltonian and @xmath1 an eigenvalue with spectral projection @xmath2 .",
    "under appropriate regularity conditions on @xmath0 and the assumption that @xmath1 is separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum of @xmath0 , the adiabatic theorem states that the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath3 satisfies @xmath4 i.e.  that any solution starting in the spectral subspace @xmath5 evolves into the subspace @xmath6 up to an error of order @xmath7 .",
    "this error estimate , which contributes to the error of the adiabatic approximation , is optimal in the sense that generically the piece @xmath8 of the solution in the orthogonal complement of @xmath6 is really of order @xmath7 and not smaller for any finite time @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "however , if @xmath0 is constant outside of a bounded interval , say @xmath11 $ ] , and @xmath12-times continuously differentiable , then clearly @xmath13 for @xmath14 , but also @xmath15 thus the non - adiabatic transitions into the orthogonal complement of @xmath6 after a compactly supported adiabatic change of the hamiltonian are much smaller than  @xmath16 .",
    "what happens is that during the adiabatic change of the hamiltonian the solution does not exactly follow the spectral subspace @xmath6 , which we will call the adiabatic subspace in the following , but slightly tilted @xmath7-dependent subspaces ran@xmath17 , so - called superadiabatic subspaces . with respect to the superadiabatic subspaces one has @xmath18 in addition it holds that @xmath19 which together with ( [ ia3 ] ) implies the usual adiabatic estimate ( [ ia1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , at times  @xmath9 when all derivatives of @xmath0 vanish , the superadiabatic projections agree with the adiabatic projection , @xmath20 , and thus ( [ ia3 ] ) implies also  ( [ ia2 ] ) . in figure  [ transhist ]",
    "the situation is plotted schematically .",
    "$ ] and outside of this interval the adiabatic subspace @xmath2 , i.e.  the instantaneous spectral subspace , agrees with the superadiabatic subspace @xmath17 .",
    "while the non - adiabatic transitions for @xmath21 are of order @xmath22 , the norm of the piece of the solution that leaks into the orthogonal complement of @xmath2 for @xmath23 is typically much larger , namely of order @xmath7 .",
    "the norm of the piece of the solution that leaks into the orthogonal complement of the superadiabatic subspace @xmath17 for @xmath23 remains small , i.e.  of order @xmath22 , for all times.[transhist],height=151 ]    in this sense we say that the error of the adiabatic approximation is of order @xmath7 , while the non - adiabatic transitions are ( at most ) of order @xmath22 . for a detailed exposition of adiabatic theory with spectral gap",
    "we refer to  @xcite and references therein . here",
    "let us mention only that the notion `` superadiabatic '' was termed by m.  berry in  @xcite .",
    "there he shows how for hamiltonians depending analytically on time the transitions between superadiabatic subspaces are even exponentially small in @xmath7 ( as it is known also from the famous landau - zener model ) and moreover , that the transitions as a function of time follow the universal shape of an error function , i.e.  an integrated gaussian .",
    "a rigorous account of  @xcite is given in  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we show within a physically relevant but relatively simple example that in the gapless case the situation is to some extend similar . before presenting our results in detail",
    "let us introduce the model and explain some of its important features .",
    "we consider a scalar massless field in three spatial dimensions .",
    "the momentum space for a single boson is @xmath24 and the state space of the field is the symmetric fock space @xmath25 so @xmath26 is a sequence @xmath27 with @xmath28 a square integrable symmetric function of @xmath29 variables in @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath31 the inner product is @xmath32 the hamiltonian of the free field is @xmath33 and acts as @xmath34 as a multiplication operator @xmath35 is self - adjoint on its dense maximal domain  @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , @xmath35 has a unique ground state given by the fock vacuum @xmath37 .",
    "now we add moving charges as sources to the field . for notational simplicity",
    "we assume that all sources have the same normalized form factor @xmath38 with @xmath39 later on we will make additional assumptions on the `` charge distribution ''  @xmath40 .",
    "the sources are located at positions @xmath41 with total charge @xmath42 and form factor @xmath40 . the linear coupling to the field is given by the operator @xmath43 where we abbreviate @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath40 and  @xmath46 is the field operator @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the standard bosonic annihilation and creation operators on  @xmath50 , see section  [ sec : fock ] for more details . under appropriate conditions on @xmath40",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath51 is self - adjoint on @xmath52 and bounded from below .",
    "if the total charge of the sources @xmath53 is zero , @xmath54 has a unique ground state @xmath55 .",
    "the ground state @xmath56 contains so - called `` virtual bosons '' that provide a `` dressing '' of the sources .",
    "in contrast to `` free bosons '' , the virtual bosons do not propagate .",
    "these heuristic notions will be made more precise later on .",
    "if the total charge is different from zero there is still a good notion of approximate ground state , at least for our purposes",
    ".    we will be interested in the dynamics of the scalar field when the sources change their locations with time .",
    "let @xmath57 , @xmath58 be smooth , then @xmath59 describes the evolution of the scalar field in the presence of sources moving along the prescribed trajectories @xmath60 .",
    "we consider the solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath61 for the field in the adiabatic limit @xmath62 , which corresponds to slowly moving sources .",
    "assume for a moment that the field is restricted to a finite box .",
    "then the hamiltonian @xmath0 has purely discrete spectrum and the ground state is separated from the first excited state by a gap .",
    "the adiabatic theorem implies that if the field starts in the ground state @xmath63 of @xmath64 , it remains up to a phase @xmath7-close to the ground state @xmath65 of @xmath0 at later times .",
    "the solution is thus @xmath7-close to a state where a static cloud of virtual bosons follows the slowly moving sources and no radiation is emitted .",
    "the error of the adiabatic approximation is of order @xmath7 .",
    "if we pass to the superadiabatic approximation , we realize that the solution is even @xmath22-close to a state @xmath66 where an @xmath7-dependent cloud of virtual bosons follows the slowly moving sources and no radiation is emitted .",
    "the state @xmath66 is still @xmath7-close to the static ground state @xmath65 , however , the dressing by virtual bosons depends now also on the velocities @xmath67 and higher derivatives of @xmath60 . if at some time the sources come to rest then from that time on @xmath68 , hence the field is @xmath22-close to the static ground state again . in particular",
    ", the probability for emitting a free boson is at most of order  @xmath69 .",
    "the sources are at rest and the adiabatic approximation agrees with the true solution . while the sources are moving ,",
    "the dressing is deformed , which leads to an error of order @xmath7 in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the superadiabatic approximation takes into account the deformation and the error is only of order @xmath22 . when the sources are again at rest for @xmath21 , the dressing is again the static one and the error of the adiabatic and the superadiabatic approximation is of order @xmath22",
    "this error is due to non - adiabatic transitions that correspond to the emission of free bosons.[f2 ] , height=377 ]    summarizing the above , we have that as long as there is a gap and as long as the prescribed trajectories @xmath60 are @xmath70 , non - adiabatic transitions corresponding to the emission of free bosons are at most of order  @xmath22 . nonetheless , the error of the adiabatic approximation is of order @xmath7 for all times where @xmath71 because of the deformation of the cloud of virtual bosons , see also figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "this exemplifies in a simple physical example why it is important to distinguish carefully between the error of the adiabatic approximation and the non - adiabatic transitions .",
    "it also is an example where superadiabatic subspaces have a clear physical meaning as velocity - dependent dressing of the sources .",
    "this is of course all well known and the content of this paper is to show that this picture survives also in the case without spectral gap , i.e.  in the thermodynamic limit where the box is replaced by @xmath30 .    in the remainder of the introduction we provide informal statements of our main results , where for simplicity we restrict to the case of a neutral system . then there is a unitary transformation @xmath72 such that @xmath73 and thus @xmath54 has a unique ground state @xmath74 with eigenvalue @xmath75 .",
    "the general and rigorous statements are explained in section  2 .",
    "our first result is an adiabatic theorem without spectral gap , cf",
    ".  theorem  [ thm : adapp ] . + * adiabatic theorem : * _ the solution of @xmath76 with @xmath77 satisfies for any @xmath78 @xmath79 _",
    "thus , although the spectrum of @xmath54 is the whole half line @xmath80 and the eigenvalue @xmath75 is not separated by a gap from the continuous spectrum , the usual adiabatic approximation for the evolution of eigenstates holds with almost the same error estimate as in the gapped case .",
    "we have even more : if one adds free bosons then their dynamics is adiabatic too in the following sense .",
    "to each configuration @xmath81 of the sources the annihilation and creation operators of free bosons are @xmath82 and @xmath83 and thus @xmath84 where @xmath85 is just the free time evolution of a boson and @xmath86 stands either for @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "now we define the adiabatic approximation as @xmath89 we will show that it approximates the solution of ( [ schroe ] ) with initial datum @xmath90 in the same sense as in ( [ adi0 ] ) , @xmath91    if we denote by @xmath92 the projection on the sector of fock space containing exactly @xmath93 free bosons , where @xmath94 is the projection on the @xmath95-particle sector of fock space , the above result implies that for @xmath96 @xmath97 i.e.  that the probability for emitting a free boson is at most of order @xmath98 . note that this means that not only the spectral subspace @xmath99 is adiabatically invariant , but also the subspaces @xmath100 , which are not spectral subspaces of the instantaneous hamiltonian @xmath101 .    in order to understand what part of @xmath102 really corresponds to emission of free bosons and what part is merely a velocity - dependent deformation of the dressing",
    ", we need to introduce the superadiabatic picture . now",

    "[ lem : v ] we construct a velocity - dependent dressing operator @xmath103 such that the corresponding objects @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 allow for an improved adiabatic approximation .",

    "finally one can ask for the probability of emitting a free boson , i.e.  for computing @xmath120 .",
    "however , due to the infrared problem it turns out that this has no nice asymptotics for @xmath121 and we can only show @xmath122 . but a physically more interesting question is the energy radiated through the emission of free bosons . in theorem  [ thm :",

    "as our analysis showed , this velocity - dependent term is the energy in the deformation of the dressing and being of order @xmath131 , it is much bigger than the energy emitted by radiation of free bosons , which is of order @xmath132 . in order to obtain the correct picture",
    ", the use of superadiabatic approximations seems inevitable .",
    "finally let us mention that a closely related problem was considered in  @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "there semiclassical limit of non - relativistic schrdinger particles coupled to a massless scalar field was considered . in a sense",
