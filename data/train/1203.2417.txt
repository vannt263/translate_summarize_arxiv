    "multifunctional materials have drawn a lot of attention in recent years because of their intrinsic scientific interest and for the huge technological possibilities they offer .",
    "indeed these materials simultaneously exhibit two or more characteristics that are usually incompatible : ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism for multiferroics , uncorrelated thermal and electrical conductivity for thermoelectrics , or semiconductor ( sc ) character and ferromagnetism .",
    "some homogeneous materials are available , however they usually exhibit weak properties or are limited to very low temperatures @xcite . in order to open a broader range of opportunities ,",
    "heterogeneous materials have been proposed as an efficient way to couple strong responses at room temperature @xcite . among the multifunctional materials , those based on semiconductors yield great promises , and similar enhancements",
    "are expected in nanostructured media for thermoelectricity @xcite and magnetic semiconductivity @xcite . regarding this last issue",
    ", it has been shown that depending on the solubility limit and the growth temperature , magnetic impurities tend to make a solid solution and form dilute magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) , or gather in solute - rich precipitates via a phase separation process @xcite .",
    "the formation of elongated nano - clusters observed in several systems such as al(cr)n ( ref .  ) or ( ge , mn)-nanocolumns @xcite is a way of getting the attractive heterogeneous materials discussed above .",
    "controlling the growth thanks to a detailed understanding of the phase separation mechanism , is a prerequisite for their efficient use to design new multifunctional materials .    as a new perspective",
    ", it is well known from physical metallurgy that phase separation into an over - saturated solid solution can occur via a three - step mechanism , for example in the alcu system @xcite : i ) the solute atoms diffuse in the host matrix to form guinier - preston ( gp ) zones , which are solute - rich zones ( also referred to as @xmath1 ) that keep the host matrix atomic structure ; ii ) these zones transform to a secondary metastable phase ( @xmath2 , isostructural to caf@xmath3 ) that is fully coherent with the host matrix , thus minimizing interface energy ; iii ) a last transformation occurs with the formation of the stable al@xmath3cu phase @xmath4 which is structurally incompatible with the host matrix .",
    "it is clear in this sequence that interfaces play a major role , especially in the stabilization of the metastable @xmath2 phase .    in this article , we show that this interface - driven mechanism is also relevant in the case of magnetic semiconductors , but with specificities not taken into account up to now . in order to get a deeper insight into the problem",
    ", we consider the gemn system as a prototype , in which either dilute mn atoms @xcite , mn - rich nanocolumns  @xcite ( nc ) , or precipitates of the stable phase @xcite are observed depending on the growth conditions .",
    "the alcu precipitation sequence can be applied in the case of the gemn system with the @xmath4 phase being the @xmath5 compound while the @xmath2 and @xmath1 phases as revealed in the nanocolumns remain unknown .",
    "this analysis is more complete than the simple spinodal decomposition scheme @xcite that only focuses on the first stage of the former sequence leading to a coherent solute - rich solid solution ( i.e. dms @xmath6 @xmath1 ) .",
    "still , the precipitation sequence needs to be slightly adapted . on one hand , in the case of alcu , one deals with compact metallic phases with atomic structures and chemical behaviors basically all compatible in essence , leading to easy mixing , formation of solid solutions and natural interfaces . on the other hand , in the case of dilute semiconductors , the involved phases display non compact structures ( diamond or wurtzite ) for the host , and much more compact phases for precipitates , with very little structural and chemical compatibility to one another@xcite , leading to strong chemical segregation and incoherent interfaces",
    "the thorough study of two types of gemn materials in bulk conditions , followed by the introduction of their interfaces with the semiconductor matrix , allows us to unravel not only the mechanisms behind this variety of precipitates , but also the atomic structure of the gemn nanocolumns .",
    "this yields a new understanding and potential control over these complex and very promising heterogeneous systems .",
    "we use the density functional theory ( dft ) framework , within the projector augmented - wave approach ( paw ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation energy , as implemented in the abinit code @xcite .",
    "the details are those used in ref .  .",
    "in particular , the pseudopotentials have been generated with the atompaw code@xcite .",
    "they correspond to valence electron states 4@xmath7 and 4@xmath8 for ge and 3@xmath9 and 4@xmath7 for mn .",
    "the @xmath10-point meshes and the cutoff energy ensure an error on the total dft energy lower than 0.1  ev / atom .",
    "since we want to compare the stability of phases with different values of the mn concentration , @xmath11 , we calculate their formation energies per atom : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy per atom found with our first - principle calculations , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the chemical potential of mn and ge , respectively . when manganese atoms are introduced in a germanium matrix , the ultimate system obtained after annealing",
    "is composed of mn@xmath16ge@xmath17 grains embedded in the diamond lattice of germanium .",
    "therefore , these crystals , mn@xmath16ge@xmath17 and ge , are the two reference systems we have considered to determine @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "when two phases @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with different compositions , are coexisting , the chemical potentials can be derived by considering the thermodynamic semi - grand canonical potential as described in ref .",
    ":    @xmath20    when @xmath18 is the ge diamond lattice and @xmath19 is the mn@xmath16ge@xmath17 compounds , we get :    @xmath21    it can be checked that the formation energies [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] of the ge lattice and the mn@xmath16ge@xmath17 compound ( or a mixture of them ) are zero , since they are the chosen reservoirs of atoms in the semi - grand canonical ensemble .",
    "note that a less natural , but reasonable , choice would have been to choose the compound mn@xmath22ge@xmath23 as a reference , since it has a composition close to that of mn@xmath16ge@xmath17 and has a simpler unit cell .",
    "the difference on the formation energies of the compounds studied here would only have been of the order of 10  mev .",
    "this methodology has proven to well reproduce both the properties and the stability of all known ( ge , mn ) compounds @xcite , despite the necessary and usual approximations used .",
    "we start with the assumption accepted so far @xcite that the binding energy between magnetic impurities in the diamond structure drives the formation of a solid solution inside the nanocolumns @xcite . those are thus supposed to be domains where the concentration of mn impurities is locally increased , yet with little effect on the diamond structure .",
    "since the mn atoms could incorporate substitutionally or interstitially into the diamond ge crystal lattice , we test the solid - solution assumption by considering a class of materials based on both mn defects ( see fig .  [ fig_1]a ) . more specifically",
    ", we use cubic cells of 5.658    of side ( 8 atoms of ge ) , and consider all the possible combinations of substitutional and tetrahedral interstitial mn atoms up to a concentration of 60% . in the following ,",
    "we name @xmath24t@xmath25s a solid solution with @xmath24 mn in tetrahedral interstitial sites and @xmath25 mn in substitution per cubic unit cell , hence with a concentration @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the restriction to these only two defects is based on observations by transmission electron microscopy showing a clear crystalline continuity between mn - rich regions and diamond ge along the [ 001 ] direction , thus discarding non crystal - aligned defects .",
    "in addition , our simulations of six different point defects involving one mn atom and of nine associated mn dimers confirm the energetic relevance of only the substitutional and tetrahedral interstitial defects ( see appendix  [ annexe : point_defects ] ) .",
    "finally , 27 non - equivalent configurations are tested ( some examples are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig_1]b ) .",
    "ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders have been considered , and the antiferromagnetic configurations turn out to have the lowest energies .",
    "the evolution of the formation energy @xmath29 with the mn content is reported on fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "first , we can see a steep increase of @xmath29 at low concentration ( the slope being 1.5  ev / mn atom ) , in agreement with the low solubility of mn in ge @xcite . then at higher concentration ,",
    "the interactions between defects lower the formation energy @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , the curve differs from a straight line , and the formation energy reaches a maximum around 400  mev / atom , before decreasing .",
    "the most significant result here is this hump - shaped curve with the maximum of the formation energy at 35% of mn , _",
    "i.e. _ , within the concentration range of 15 - 40% for which the precipitates are observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the absence of a minimum of @xmath30 in this experimental range rules out a hypothetical stability of a diamond based coherent solid solution .",
    "accordingly , our calculations show that neither a spinodal decomposition , nor the analog of the first step of an alcu precipitation sequence can occur in the bulk of the matrix . in the latter case",
    "it would correspond to the so - called guinier - preston zones ( also referred as @xmath1 phase ) .",
    "however , subsurface interstitials have been reported in refs .  .",
    "we propose that this interstitial - rich solid solution at the surface could be in fact the @xmath1 phase , forming guinier - preston zones that will start the next precipitation step with a @xmath2 phase inside nanocolumns . in the following section ,",
    "we propose a structure for such a @xmath2 phase .",
    "since the previous section has shown that gemn solid - solution precipitates are not compatible with the @xmath30 curve , we need an equivalent of the @xmath2 phase of alcu , which is stabilized thanks to its natural interfaces with the host matrix . we propose a new class of materials based on the insertion of mn into a simple - cubic crystal of ge ( fig .  [ fig_1]c ) .",

    ", width=325 ]    such a structure was proposed to describe mnge@xmath33 , which is stable at high - pressure @xcite .",
    "the exact structure was not determined experimentally , but  from similarity with hg@xmath33pt  it was suggested to involve mn atoms placed every four interstitial positions , which are at the center of the ge cubes .",
    "it exhibits a striking structural proximity with diamond ge , with a mismatch of only -2.5% and -1.0% along the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , the calculated formation energy reaches 180  mev / atom @xcite .    applying the same approach as for the @xmath24t@xmath25s compounds , we have tested 45 different atomic configurations of mn interstitials , using various cell sizes to have a complete energy diagram of all cubic ge - based compounds .",
    "we have discovered a whole family of low energy structures , based on the ge@xmath3mn phase shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1]c , which is isostructural to @xmath0 fesi@xmath3 .",
    "we refer to it as the `` @xmath0-phase family '' ( see fig .  [ fig_1]d ) .",
    "such a variety in stoichiometry is common in the gemn system , as illustrated by mn@xmath36ge alloys @xcite .",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters of the perfect @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn phase are @xmath34=@xmath37=2.90    and @xmath35=5.45    ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1]c ) , leading to @xmath38=0.94 .",
    "thus , despite its simple - cubic crystal structure , this compound exhibits a lattice mismatch with bulk ge lower than 4% in all 3 directions , and a cell volume only 1.6% larger , in agreement with observations of ref .  .",
    "also , a decrease in the mn content is accompanied by a regular decrease of the cell size , as expected from the interstitial character of mn atoms , leading to a cell volume at 20% mn almost equal to that of bulk ge , with @xmath39 .",
    "note that the new metastable ge@xmath3mn compound c16 described in ref .",
    "is directly related to the ",
    "@xmath0-phase family \" but is distorted by a jahn - teller - type effect , making it strongly tetragonal and incompatible with the diamond structure .",
    "our calculations show that the @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn compound exhibits ferromagnetism , with a local moment on mn atoms reaching 1  @xmath40 , and a polarization p0=-80% and p2=-83% ( with definitions of p0 and p2 as in ref .  ) .",
    "the formation energy of the @xmath0 phases displays a broad minimum around 60  mev / atom , at mn concentrations ranging from 20% to 33% .",
    "above 33% , mn interstitial atoms must be added in the empty interstitial planes of @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn , at a formation energy cost of about 1  ev per mn atom added .",
    "below 20% , mn planes of @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn become less than half filled and the formation energy increases rapidly , until the unstable simple - cubic ge is left .",
    "thus , contrary to the @xmath24t@xmath25s configurations , the @xmath0-phases family gives rise to a second minimum of energy versus stoichiometry compatible with a segregation mechanism .",
    "furthermore , the flatness of the minimum in the 20 to 33% range , agrees with the different mn concentrations observed in the nanocolumns by jamet _",
    "( 20%33% ) @xcite , as well as in similar precipitates by bougeard _ et al_. ( 15% ) @xcite and by li _",
    "( 17%30% ) @xcite .",
    "since the nanocolumns are embedded in the ge matrix , the elastic energy has to be considered .",
    "we do not calculate exactly this energy , which depends on the nanocolumn distribution , but an upper bound of it . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , we have calculated the formation energies of the possible structures either with their own lattices parameters , or constrained to be commensurate with the ge lattice ( hollow versus filled markers ) .",
    "the last situation corresponds to a state in which all the elastic constraints are localized inside the columns . in the reality",
    ", the matrix would also adapt to the stress in order to globally minimize this energy .",
    "therefore , the energy difference between a phase constrained or not constrained by the ge diamond lattice is an upper bound of the total elastic energy .",
    "these values turn out to be quite small  about 10  mev / atom  compared to other energy terms , and are thus fairly accurate approximations of the values of the elastic energy .",
    "more precisely , the formation energy of a given compound , including the elastic energy due to its embedding in the matrix of germanium , is located between the hollow and filled markers in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "the structural compatibility between diamond ge and @xmath0 phases is of major importance here .",
    "we now evaluate interface energies within the usual slab approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , from simulations of alternating crystalline layers .",
    "the surface energy @xmath41 , between two phases @xmath18 and @xmath19 , is thus defined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total boundary area and @xmath44 is the total internal energy in the periodic cell , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the number of atoms in the layers of the respective phases , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the formation energies [ eq .  ( [ equ : ef ] ) ] . appendix  [ annexe : surface_energy ] details the relation between this eq .",
    "( [ equ : es ] ) and the thermodynamic semi - grand canonical ensemble . at equilibrium ,",
    "the crystalline layers have not exactly the same lattice parameters parallel to the interface .",
    "thus , to minimize the strain imposed to the layers by the common computer cell periodicities , the size of this cell is relaxed perpendicularly to the interface during the calculation of @xmath44 . accordingly , the formation energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : es ] ) are calculated with the same elastic conditions : fixed unit - cell periodicities except for the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "the width of the layers is increased until we get a convergence for @xmath41 better than 2  mev / @xmath49 .",
    "this condition is achieved when the width of each compound is greater than 15   , _",
    "i.e. _ , a value that is of the same order of magnitude as the nanocolumn diameters .",

    ", the interface energy is found larger : 63  mev / @xmath49 , which is compatible with the cylindrical shape of the grains .",

    "the transformation of the nanocolumns into rounded grains after annealing , shows that the nanocolumns are out of equilibrium .",
    "above , we have introduced and calculated the main terms of energy : chemical energy , elastic energy and interface energy .",
    "we now want to take into account all of these terms and discuss the stability of the system depending on the particular distribution of mn atoms .",
    "first , we consider three types of large scale order : i ) full homogeneous dilution of mn atoms in the whole ge diamond matrix ; ii ) nanocolumns with a high mn concentration embedded in a matrix of germanium depleted in mn ; and iii ) spherical clusters under similar conditions .",
    "the first case has been assumed in refs .  , with a growth at low temperature probably corresponding to a very limited atomic diffusion .",
    "the second situation has been obtained at intermediate temperature @xcite ; the columnar shape has been linked to a predominance of surface diffusion during the growth @xcite .",
    "finally , the spherical clusters have been obtained with a high temperature growth @xcite or after annealing@xcite , and therefore involve a three - dimensional ( 3d ) diffusion .",
    "second , we compute the total energy for different atomic local orders : a ) simple defects of the ge diamond crystal ; b ) @xmath0-ge@xmath3mn crystalline grains ; or c ) mn@xmath53ge@xmath36 crystalline grains .",
    "the details of the size and morphology are taken from ref .",
    ": average mn concentration of 4.1% , 30 000 columns per @xmath57m@xmath58 ( which together fix their mean diameter , 2  nm for @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn for instance ) , and spherical clusters of 10  nm in diameter .",
    "ge@xmath3mn , and @xmath59-mn@xmath53ge@xmath36 .",
    "the energy model includes chemical , elastic , and interface energies .",
    "it is applied to three distinct mn repartitions , which are metastable but experimentally observed depending on the growth conditions : i ) mn dilute in the host ge matrix ( dms ) , ii ) mn atoms gathered inside nanocolumns , and iii ) mn inside spherical precipitates .",
    "the assumed characteristics of the atomic diffusion in these three cases are indicated .",
    "the experimental data describing these mn repartitions are taken from devillers _",
    "@xcite : global mn concentration is 4.1% , column density is 30000  @xmath57m@xmath60 , diameter of spherical precipitates is 10  nm .",
    "the zero of the energy corresponds to a phase separation between diamond ge and @xmath4-mn11ge8 ( the atom reservoirs ) with interfaces , free surfaces , and elastic constraints that are negligible . , width=325 ]    figure  [ fig_3 ] presents the energy contributions when the different chemical orders are considered .",
    "first , it appears that the solid solution is ruled out by its very high total energy , in both phase - separation cases .",
    "the case of full dilution has therefore to be limited to lower mn contents .",
    "the high surface - to - volume ratio of the nanocolumns ( @xmath61 2  nm@xmath62 here as compared to 0.6  nm@xmath62 for a 10-nm sphere ) is indeed not high enough to favor a columnar solid solution : the low chemical energy of @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn compensates for its interface energy . on the other hand , @xmath63 is yet high enough to make the formation of mn@xmath53ge@xmath36 energetically unfavorable , because of its structural incompatibility with diamond - ge , even if its formation energy is almost zero .",
    "indeed , the lateral coherence of @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn with the ge crystal , and the resulting low - interface - energy compensate in this case for its higher formation energy . finally , in the case of spherical",
    "precipitates where the ratio @xmath63 is much smaller , the interface - energy advantage of @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn phase is not as crucial , and the mn@xmath53ge@xmath36 compound is found stable as observed experimentally .    from these observations , we can now propose a coherent precipitation sequence in the line of the three - stage precipitation sequence of al@xmath3cu ( diluted @xmath64 ) .",
    "the first stage ( dms @xmath65 ) corresponds to high surface - diffusion during the sample growth@xcite and makes possible the precipitation of mn - rich domains in the subsurface of the sample .",
    "such a structure has not been studied in the present paper but is an extension of the reported subsurface interstitials @xcite .",
    "the second stage ( @xmath66 ) corresponds to the germination of a coherent @xmath2 phase from mn interstitials .",
    "this phase has been identified as the proposed @xmath0 phase , which is more likely to be stabilized in the form of nanocolumns ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) . finally , the last stage ( @xmath67 ) is the transformation into the stable and less coherent mn@xmath53ge@xmath36 compound thanks to 3d diffusion .",
    "this latter transformation also leads to a change of the shape of the precipitates from columns to round - shape precipitates .",
    "in previous sections , we have assessed the stability of the @xmath0 phase based on theoretical arguments . we now want to analyze our previous experimental characterizations of the gemn nanocolumns @xcite taking into account the structure that we propose with the @xmath0 phase .",
    "in addition , we first present new results of high - resolution electron microscopy .",
    "[ [ tem ] ] tem  + + + + +    up to this work , the hypothesis made for the nanocolumn structure was the solid - solution phase in particular because of its strong similarity with the germanium matrix when observed by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) as shown in figs .",

    "the presence of two non - equivalent sub - lattices , one for ge and one for mn , corresponds to a super - structure which should be visible in plane view .",
    "however , these sub - lattices generate two variants depending on the position of the cell origin with respect to the diamond - ge cell , and these two variants are expected to coexist inside each column , because of the very low interface energy of the anti - phase boundaries bridging them ( we calculate it to be lower than 10  mev / @xmath49 ) .",
    "we have included these two variants to calculate a tem image of an unrelaxed @xmath0-ge@xmath3mn nanocolumn in germanium ( jems software @xcite ) , in cross section ( fig .",

    "[ fig_4]d ) .",
    "the simulated images show a striking resemblance between @xmath0 phase and diamond ge .",

    "is adopted . instead of fitting the exafs signal with a set of theoretical scattering paths coming from mn simple defects in ge or clusters from well - known bulk structures ( e.g. , mn@xmath53ge@xmath36 ) , as previously done by our group  @xcite and others  @xcite , we proceed in a qualitative analysis of the simulated exafs spectra based on molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations of large relaxed cubic cells containing 96 atoms and 11.315    of side , using the experimental lattice parameter of germanium  @xcite . due to the fact that we are considering complex structures with multiple absorbing sites , this approach has the advantage to correctly account for both the configurational and dynamical disorders .",

    "this is demonstrated by the strong amplitude reduction when moving from the bulk ( @xmath0-bulk@xmath72 ) to the ideal nanocolumn ( @xmath0-ncs@xmath72 ) .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to the large number of mn atoms located at the interface with the ge matrix of which local environment is too highly distorted to generate a coherent oscillation . indeed , for nanocolumns of 2  nm in diameter , half of the mn atoms are at the interface and are displaced by more than 0.2    as compared to perfect @xmath0 ge@xmath3mn .",

    "sufficient @xmath10-point mesh density must however be used to reproduce accurately the diamond ge crystal . in the following calculations ,",
