    "in the sloan digital sky survey , a number of high redshift quasars have been discovered that are remarkable for their lack of emission lines .",
    "a detailed study of one of these objects , sdssp  j153259.96@xmath7003944.1 ( hereafter referred to as sdss  j1532@xmath70039 ) was presented by fan et al .",
    "the optical spectrum , redward of 6800  , is a featureless blue power - law continuum ; there are no emission lines .",
    "blueward of 6800  , there are features due to ly@xmath8 absorption that lead to a redshift estimate of @xmath9 .",
    "featureless continua are frequently found in bl lac objects .",
    "however , sdss  j1532@xmath70039 does not appear to have other characteristic properties of bl  lac objects : it was not detected in a deep radio observation , does nt vary in the optical , and was not found to be optically polarized .",
    "follow - up observations with _",
    "chandra _ failed to detect the quasar , indicating an @xmath10 .",
    "is defined as the point - to - point slope between 2500 and 2 kev . ]",
    "this steep @xmath5 makes it moderately x - ray weak ( vignali et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "phl 1811 is a luminous narrow - line quasar that was rediscovered in the vla first survey ( leighly et al .",
    "it is a very bright ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , nearby ( @xmath0 ) object , well away from the galactic plane , so it was surprising that it was not detected in the rosat all sky survey .",
    "two _ chandra _ observations show that it is x - ray weak , with inferred @xmath5 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , much steeper than for a typical quasar of this luminosity ( @xmath15 ; wilkes et al .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "spectrum is unusual in that it is dominated by , and there are no prominent broad emission lines .",
    "we thought that the x - ray weakness and the lack of broad emission lines suggest a similarity to sdss  j1532@xmath70039 .",
    "the _ hst _ stis observation of phl 1811 was performed 2001 december 3 and the two _ chandra _ observations were performed 2001 december 5 and 17 . figure  1 shows the spectral energy distribution of phl 1811 . the steep @xmath5 show that phl 1811 was x - ray weak compared with typical quasar of its luminosity .",
    "it appears to be intrinsically x - ray weak , rather than absorbed , because it is variable between two observations twelve days apart , a fact that rules out the possibility that the central engine is absorbed and we observe scattered x - rays .",
    "furthermore , the spectral index is nominal for a nls1 ( @xmath16 ) , rather than flat as it might be if it were absorbed .",
    "the details of these observations will be presented in leighly , halpern & jenkins , in preparation .",
    "the three high - z lineless quasars that we considered were sdss  j1532@xmath70039 ( z=4.62 ; fan et al .",
    "1999 ) and two reported by anderson et al .",
    "2000 ( sdss j1302@xmath170030 and sdss  j1442@xmath170110 ; z=4.5 and z=4.56 , respectively ) . since the time that these were reported , apparently a number of others have been discovered ( see the contribution by collinge , these proceedings ) .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison of the phl 1811 uv spectrum , shifted to z=4.5 , with the sdss spectrum of sdss  j1302@xmath170039 .",
    "the keck spectrum of sdss  j1532@xmath70039 published by fan et al .",
    "1999 has a much better signal - to - noise ratio . to accentuate the contrast between these objects and typical quasars",
    ", we also show the francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) lbqs quasar compliation spectrum shifted to z=4.77 , and the sdss spectrum of an arbitrarily - chosen high - redshift quasar .",
    "in this contribution , we discuss the similarity between the uv spectrum of phl 1811 and the spectra of several high - z lineless quasars discovered in the sdss , and propose that the physical cause of their spectra is the same . at the same time",
    ", we acknowledge that the sdss is quite likely to find lineless quasars whose spectra have a different origin ; for example , they may be bl  lac objects .",
    "if it is true that these spectra are a result of the same phenomenon , what are the potential implications ? because of their steep x - ray spectra and high amplitude x - ray variability , it has been proposed that nls1s are characterized by a high accretion rate ( e.g. , leighly 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "since emission - line widths should depend on the black hole mass ( laor 2000 ) , luminous nls1s should have exceptionally high accretion rates compared with their eddington value .",
    "it is important to understand the accretion rate in high redshift objects , as luminous quasars have large black holes , and in order to grow large in the short amount of time implied by the high redshift , they should be accreting at a rapid rate .",
    "naturally , people are searching for a connection between high redshift quasars and nls1s ( e.g. , mathur 2000 ) , although the evidence so far is mixed ( constantin et al .",
    "based on the similarities between phl 1811 and the high - z lineless quasars , we suggest that they are the early universe counterparts of luminous narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies .    what causes the weak emission lines ? in phl 1811 , the higher - ionization emission lines are probably weak because the continuum is very soft overall",
    ". such a soft continuum can produce copious h@xmath18 and fe@xmath19 ions , but few higher ionization species .",
    "also , the equivalent widths of the lines will appear small against the strong , blue optical / uv continuum .",
