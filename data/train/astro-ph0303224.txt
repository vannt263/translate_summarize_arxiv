    "dwarf novae are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , which are close binaries containing a white - dwarf primary with an accretion disk and a late - type main - sequence secondary star filling its roche - lobe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they are characterized by repetitive outbursts .",
    "su uma stars are a subclass of dwarf novae which show normal outbursts and superoutbursts .",
    "the presence of superhumps during superoutbursts is a diagnostic of su uma stars @xcite .",
    "wz sge stars , showing very long recurrence cycle of superoutbursts ( years  decades ) and no or few normal outburst during one supercycle , are extreme su uma stars with shortest orbital periods among su uma stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the contrary ,",
    "er uma stars or rz lmi stars are another extreme su uma stars with short orbital periods , which show very short supercycle of a few ten days ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "about outburst mechanisms of su uma stars , @xcite rejected a recent enhanced mass transfer model ( see @xcite ) and proposed a refined tidal - thermal instability model .",
    "the superhump phenomenon with a period slightly longer than the orbital period are well explained by the beat of the precession of a tidally distorted disk with the orbital motion of the secondary ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the period of superhumps are known to decrease during a superoutburst in usual su uma stars , and the typical value of the period derivative is @xmath1 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is attributed to decreasing apsidal motion due to a shrinking of disk during superoutburst @xcite .",
    "however , several systems are revealed to show positive period derivations by recent observations ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "most of them are short period systems , such as wz sge stars .",
    "hv vir ( for a historical review of this object and a recent review of wz sge stars , see @xcite ) is one of wz sge stars .",
    "@xcite revealed the presence of two superhump periods , the early superhump period of 0.057085(23 )  d and the superhump period of 0.05820(4 )  d during the 1992 outburst , and confirmed its wz sge nature .",
    "@xcite also showed that the period derivative of superhumps had a positive value of @xmath2 , on contrary to the negative value obtained by @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite reported a temperature of 13300 k for the white dwarf of hv vir from the hst observation at 8 yr past the last outburst .",
    "this temperature is one of the coolest among the white dwarfs in disk - accreting close binaries , which indicates this system is an old cv as suggested by other properties @xcite .",
    "after ten years of quiescence since 1992 , a superoutburst of hv vir was detected at 2002 january 4.228(ut ) ( vsnet - alert 6964 ) .",
    "we started a ccd photometric campaign within 0.5 d of the outburst detection .",
    "we report here on the 2002 outburst of hv vir and discuss the superoutburst period change of su uma stars .",
    "we performed the photometric observations at 11 sites .",
    "the journal of the observations and the equipment used in each site are listed in table [ tab : obs_log ] .",
    "after dark subtraction and flat fielding , we performed aperture photometry or psf photometry and obtained differential magnitudes of the object relative to the comparison stars .",
    "the magnitudes obtained from the unfiltered st-7e ccd are almost equal to the rc system .",

    "the long recurrence cycle of superoutbursts and the absence of normal outbursts are common properties of the wz sge - type dwarf novae .      during the 1992 superoutburst",

    "the superhumps appeared 7 to 9  d after the visual maximum and the main outburst lasted for 23 d. our detection of the 2002 superoutburst was at @xmath22 .",
    "the delay of superhumps was @xmath23  6  d and the main outburst lasted for @xmath23  20  d. if we assume the superoutburst maximum was within 0.5 d after the last negative observation and the declining rate of the first stage was the same as that of the 1992 outburst , the visual maximum of the 2002 outburst is estimated to be @xmath20  12.0 mag .",
    "the declining rate during the first 10  d of the plateau stage was almost constant at 0.12 mag d@xmath10 .",
    "during the last 4  d , the declining stopped and the light curve became flat .",
    "the declining rate of the outburst plateau of wz sge stars , decrease from 0.2 mag d@xmath10 during the first few days to 0.13 mag d@xmath10 , a typical value for su uma stars .",
    "we missed the first rapid declining stage .",
    "the outburst maximum and the duration show that the 2002 superoutburst of hv vir was of a slightly smaller scale than the 1992 outburst .",
    "this is consistent with the quiescence durations of 11  yr and 10  yr before respective superoutbursts , since the mass stored in the disk before the 1992 outburst was estimated to be slightly more than the 2002 outburst if the mass transfer rate was constant .",
    "our observations also covered the two weeks after the fading from the main outburst , which were not well observed in the 1992 outburst .",
    "the average magnitude on the 11th day after the end of the rapid decline was brighter than those of other nights .",
    "if it indicates a rebrightening , the 10-days quiescence before the rebrightening is rather long compared with other wz sge stars or su uma stars with rebrightening(s ) .",
    "for example , in eg cnc this was one week , and in wz sge only 2 or 3 days .",
    "the mass amount stored in the accretion disk increase with the length of the quiescence period , so the amplitude of the rebrightening is expected to be larger as well .",
    "unfortunately , the error bar in our observations is fairly large .",
    "and we were unable to obtain data on the following 2 nights .",
    "therefore , we can not know about the amplitude and can only state that the outburst duration of the rebrightening was shorter than 3  days .      as described in section 3.1 , during the first two days of our observation , we obtained small - amplitude humps with a shorter period than the period of the following days , which is close to the early superhump period ( @xmath24  d ) derived by @xcite .",
    "the averaged light curve folded by @xmath25 shown in figure [ fig : early ] has a double - peaked profile that is common to early superhumps of wz sge stars .",
    "thus we can conclude that the humps observed in the first two days are early superhumps just before decaying .",
    "the large - amplitude humps on the third day of our observation shows something different on the @xmath26 diagram ( figure [ fig : oc ] ) from the following ordinary superhumps .",
    "the pdm analysis indicate that the period of four humps with cycle counts from @xmath27 to @xmath28 are longer than on following days .",
    "these humps may be a transition state of early superhumps and ordinary superhumps .",
    "the transition occurred within 2 days .",
    "however , due to the 1  d gap of our observations , the precise length of the transition state was not determined and it is not clear whether the phase jump existed or not .",
    "a similar behavior of @xmath26 was also observed during the 2001 superoutburst of wz sge @xcite .",
    "the transition between early superhumps and ordinary superhumps occurred in 0.5 day and the period of humps during the transition was also longer than following days . in the case of wz sge ,",
    "the phase jump did not exist .",
    "the mean period of ordinary superhumps , 0.0581836(30 ) d , and the period derivative , @xmath29 in the 2002 outburst , are in good agreement with those of the 1992 outburst derived by @xcite .",
    "the humps with a period of 0.05788(7 )  d during the last stage of the superoutburst are very likely to be late superhumps . due to the 2 days gap of peak timimngs",
    ", it is unclear whether the 0.5 phase jump really occured or not .",
    "we could not detect any modulation after the rapid declining .",
    "however , the late superhump period we obtained is very close to the period of 0.05799(3 )  d which @xcite obtained for the low state up to @xmath2020  days after the rapid declinig of the 1994 superoutburst of hv vir and identified with the orbital period .",
    "this confirmes that the period of 0.05799(3 )  d is identified with late superhumps as seggested by @xcite , and late superhumps in superoutbursts of hv vir persist for a long time with a constant period as in other wz sge stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
