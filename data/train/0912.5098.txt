    "two - dimensional turbulence has the striking property of organizing spontaneously into large - scale coherent structures .",
    "these coherent structures correspond to jets and vortices in geophysical and astrophysical flows @xcite .",
    "they can be reproduced in numerical simulations @xcite and laboratory experiments @xcite in either forced or unforced situations .",
    "these coherent structures involve the presence of a mean flow and fluctuations around it .",
    "the mean flow turns out to be a steady state of the pure 2d euler equations ( without forcing and dissipation ) at some coarse - grained scale . in several cases ,",
    "the steady state is characterized by a linear relationship between vorticity @xmath1 ( or potential vorticity @xmath2 in the presence of a topography @xmath3 ) and stream function @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the case of a linear @xmath5 relationship was considered early by fofonoff ( 1954 ) @xcite as a simple model of oceanic circulation .",
    "these `` fofonoff flows '' were found to emerge naturally from random initial conditions in numerical experiments of forced and unforced 2d turbulence @xcite .",
    "however , these results are not expected to be general .",
    "there exists many other cases in 2d turbulence where the @xmath5 relationship is not linear .",
    "the understanding and prediction of these quasi stationary states ( qss ) , in forced and unforced situations , is still a challenging problem .",
    "different approaches have been proposed to describe these qsss .    in the case of forced flows ( for example oceanic flows experiencing a forcing by the wind and a dissipation ) , niiler ( 1966 ) @xcite and",
    "marshall & nurser ( 1986 ) @xcite have proposed that forcing and dissipation could equilibrate each other in average and determine a qss that is a steady state of the unforced and inviscid 2d euler equation .",
    "this qss is characterized by a functional relationship @xmath6 between potential vorticity and stream function where the function @xmath7 is selected by the properties of forcing and dissipation . in particular , these authors discussed the properties that forcing must possess to generate fofonoff flows .    in the case of unforced flows , a phenomenological approach , called the minimum enstrophy principle , was proposed by bretherton & haidvogel ( 1976 ) @xcite .",
    "it is based on the inverse cascade process of batchelor ( 1969 ) @xcite .",
    "it is argued that , in the presence of a small viscosity , the ( potential ) enstrophy decays while the energy is approximately conserved .",
    "this is what matthaeus & montgomery ( 1980 ) @xcite have called selective decay . in that case , we can expect that the system will relax towards a state that minimizes ( potential ) enstrophy at fixed energy .",
    "this is mainly a postulate .",
    "this principle leads to a steady state of the 2d euler equation characterized by a linear @xmath5 relationship .",
    "when applied to geophysical flows , this principle can give an alternative justification of fofonoff flows .",
    "the minimum enstrophy principle has been generalized by leith ( 1984 ) @xcite so as to take into account the conservation of angular momentum in order to describe isolated vortices .",
    "however , this principle is purely phenomenological and it is difficult to establish its domain of validity .",
    "a statistical mechanics approach of 2d turbulence has been developed by kraichnan ( 1967,1975 ) @xcite based on the truncated euler equations . in that case , the dynamics conserves only the energy and the enstrophy ( the other constraints of the euler equation are lost by the truncation ) .",
    "since this system is liouvillian , we can apply the methods of statistical mechanics .",
    "this is the so - called energy - enstrophy statistical theory . in the absence of topography ,",
    "the truncated statistical mechanics predicts a homogeneous flow with an equilibrium energy spectrum of the form @xmath8 corresponding to an equipartition distribution . in the presence of a topography ( or @xmath9-effect ) , this statistical mechanics approach was generalized by salmon , holloway & hendershott ( 1976 ) @xcite .",
    "it leads to a mean flow where the average potential vorticity @xmath10 and the average stream function @xmath4 are related to each other by a linear relationship .",
    "when applied to geophysical flows , this approach provides a justification of fofonoff flows from statistical mechanics .",
    "however , the fact that the truncated statistical mechanics breaks the conservation of some integrals of the 2d euler equations may be considered as a limitation of this approach .",
    "another statistical mechanics of 2d turbulence , based on a point vortex approximation , was initiated by onsager ( 1949 ) @xcite and further developed by joyce & montgomery ( 1973 ) @xcite and lundgren & pointin ( 1977 ) @xcite in a mean field approximation .",
    "the statistical equilibrium state maximizes the usual boltzmann entropy ( adapted to point vortices ) while conserving the energy and the number of vortices of each species .",
    "this statistical mechanics predicts an equilibrium state where the relationship between vorticity and stream function is given by a boltzmann distribution , or a superposition of boltzmann distributions ( on the different species ) .",
    "however , the point vortex approximation is a crude approximation of real turbulent flows where the vorticity field is continuous .",
    "a statistical theory of 2d turbulence valid for continuous vorticity fields has been developed by miller ( 1990 ) @xcite and robert & sommeria ( 1991 ) @xcite .",
    "this theory takes into account all the constraints of the 2d euler equation .",
    "the statistical equilibrium state maximizes a mixing entropy while conserving energy , circulation and all the casimirs .",
    "this leads to equilibrium states with more general mean flows than in the previous approaches .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 relationship and the fluctuations around it are determined by the initial conditions and can take various shapes .",
    "however , some connections with the earlier works can be found .",
    "for example , robert & sommeria ( 1991 ) @xcite note that the results of the point vortex approach can be recovered in the dilute limit of their statistical theory .",
    "on the other hand , miller ( 1990 ) @xcite notes that for specific initial conditions leading to a gaussian vorticity distribution at statistical equilibrium , the mean flow has a linear @xmath0 relationship similar to that obtained from the minimum enstrophy principle .",
    "finally , chavanis & sommeria ( 1996 ) @xcite consider a limit of strong mixing ( or low energy ) of the mrs theory in which @xmath11 and find some connections between maximum entropy states and minimum enstrophy states . in that limit ,",
    "the maximization of entropy at fixed energy , circulation and casimirs becomes equivalent to the minimization of the macroscopic enstrophy @xmath12 at fixed energy and circulation .",
    "this justifies a form of inviscid minimum enstrophy principle in a well - defined limit of the statistical theory .",
    "this strong mixing limit also makes a hierarchy among the casimir constraints .",
    "to lowest order in the expansion @xmath11 , leading to a linear @xmath0 relationship , only the circulation @xmath13 and the microscopic enstrophy @xmath14 are important . to next orders , leading to nonlinear @xmath0 relationships , higher and higher moments @xmath15 become relevant .",
    "recently , an alternative statistical theory has been proposed by ellis , haven & turkington ( 2002 ) @xcite and further discussed by chavanis ( 2005,2008 ) @xcite and chavanis _ et al . _",
    "( 2010 ) @xcite .",
    "these authors argue that , in real situations where the flows are forced and dissipated at small scales , the conservation of all the constraints of the 2d euler equation is abusive .",
    "they propose to keep only the robust constraints ( energy and circulation ) and treat the fragile constraints canonically .",
    "this amounts to prescribing a prior vorticity distribution instead of the casimirs .",
    "this can be viewed as a grand microcanonical version of the miller - robert - sommeria ( mrs ) theory . in the ellis - haven - turkington ( eht )",
    "approach , the statistical equilibrium state maximizes a relative entropy ( determined by the prior ) while conserving energy and circulation .",
    "the mean flow turns out to maximize a generalized entropy determined by the prior at fixed circulation and energy . for a gaussian prior",
    ", the generalized entropy is proportional to minus the macroscopic enstrophy .",
    "this justifies a minimum enstrophy principle from statistical mechanics when the constraints are treated canonically and the prior is gaussian .",
    "furthermore , this approach allows to go beyond the minimum enstrophy principle by considering more complicated priors .    we can give another interpretation of the eht approach",
    "indeed , bouchet ( 2008 ) @xcite notes that the eht approach provides a _ sufficient _ condition of mrs stability .",
    "indeed , it is well - known in statistical mechanics and optimization theory @xcite that a solution of a maximization problem is always a solution of a more constrained dual maximization problem .",
    "thus , grand microcanonical stability ( eht ) implies microcanonical stability ( mrs ) .",
    "therefore , if the mean flow maximizes a generalized entropy at fixed circulation and energy , then the corresponding gibbs state is a mrs equilibrium state .",
    "however , the reciprocal is wrong in case of ensemble inequivalence ( between microcanonical and grand microcanonical ensembles ) that is generic for systems with long - range interactions @xcite . the mean flow associated to a mrs equilibrium state",
    "does not necessarily maximize a generalized entropy at fixed circulation and energy . in this sense",
    ", the minimization of enstrophy at fixed circulation and energy provides a sufficient , but not necessary , condition of mrs stability .",
    "a review of the connections between these different variational principles has been given recently by chavanis ( 2009 ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we shall complement these different approaches by considering a sort of intermediate situation between all these theories .",
    "we argue that , in most physical situations , the system is forced and dissipated at small scales . in some situations , forcing and dissipation equilibrate each other so that the system becomes , in average , statistically equivalent to the 2d euler equation where forcing and dissipation are `` switched - off '' . in particular , a quasi stationary state ( qss ) can form on a relatively short timescale .",
    "this qss involves a mean flow and fluctuations arount it .",
    "we propose to describe this state in terms of the statistical mechanics of the 2d euler equation .",
    "however , we indirectly take into account the effects of forcing and dissipation in the choice of the constraints .",
    "the energy and the circulation must be obviously conserved . by contrast , the conservation of all the casimir invariants is abusive and it is likely that some casimir invariants will be destroyed by the forcing and the dissipation .",
    "we argue that some casimir invariants are more relevant than others and that they will be selected by the properties of forcing and dissipation . in that case",
    ", the statistical equilibrium state is expected to maximize the mrs entropy with these sole constraints .",
    "it is not our goal here to determine how these constraints are selected by the properties of forcing and dissipation .",
    "this is clearly a complicated problem that has to be tackled by other methods .",
    "we shall just use a heuristic approach and consider the situation where these relevant constraints are the circulation , the energy and the microscopic enstrophy .",
    "in other words , among all the casimir constraints , we only consider the quadratic one .",
    "we do not claim that this is the most general situation but simply that it is a case of physical interest .",
    "we therefore consider _ the maximization of the mrs entropy at fixed circulation , energy and microscopic enstrophy _ and provide a detailed study of this ( non trivial ) variational principle .",
    "our maximization principle is similar in spirit to the approach of kraichnan , which only considers the conservation of energy and enstrophy .",
    "however , we remain in physical space and work with the mrs entropy for the distribution of vorticity levels while kraichnan works in fourier space .",
    "furthermor , we take into account the conservation of circulation .    it may be noted that our approach is partly motivated by results of experiments carried out in von karman flows @xcite .",
    "in fact , the present paper , valid for the 2d euler equations , prepares the ground before considering the more complicated ( but similar ) case of 3d axisymmetric turbulence treated in @xcite . in that later case , we show the equivalence between maximum entropy states at fixed helicity , angular momentum and microscopic energy and minimum macroscopic energy states at fixed helicity and angular momentum .",
    "therefore , our two approaches are closely related and provide a statistical basis for justifying the phenomenological minimum enstrophy ( 2d ) and minimum energy ( 3d axisymmetric ) principles @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_ss ] , we discuss some general properties of the steady states of the 2d euler equations .",
    "in particular , we mention the refined criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability given by ellis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite based on the maximization of a pseudo entropy at fixed circulation and energy .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_ens ] , we recall the phenomenological minimum enstrophy principle based on selective viscous decay .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_equivgen ] , we discuss the connection between maximum entropy states and minimum enstrophy states . in sec .",
    "[ sec_basic ] , we consider the maximization of the mrs entropy at fixed energy , circulation and microscopic enstrophy ( energy - enstrophy - circulation statistical mechanics ) .",
    "this maximization problem leads to a statistical equilibrium state with gaussian fluctuations and a mean flow characterized by a linear @xmath0 relationship . in sec .",
    "[ sec_equiv ] , we introduce an equivalent , but simpler , maximization problem based on the maximization of an entropic functional of the coarse - grained vorticity at fixed circulation , energy and microscopic enstrophy . this generalized entropy has some similarities with the renyi entropy @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec_reduced ] , we show _ the equivalence between the maximization of entropy at fixed energy , circulation and microscopic enstrophy and the minimization of macroscopic enstrophy at fixed energy and circulation _",
    "relationship @xcite .",
    "however , we can not conclude that these states are minimum enstrophy states ( they could be just saddle points of enstrophy at fixed circulation and energy ) .",
    "we can only prove that a minimum of enstrophy ( more generally a maximum of a `` generalized entropy '' ) at fixed circulation and energy is mrs thermodynamically stable @xcite but this is not reciprocal : the coarse - grained vorticity field associated with a mrs equilibrium state is not necessarily a minimum of enstrophy ( or more generally a maximum of a `` generalized entropy '' ) at fixed circulation and energy ( it could be a saddle point ) .",
    "by contrast , if we keep only the microscopic enstrophy as a constraint among all the casimirs , we shall prove here that the gibbs state is a maximum entropy state at fixed circulation , microscopic enstrophy and energy iff the corresponding coarse - grained vorticity field is a minimum of macroscopic enstrophy state at fixed circulation and energy . ] .",
    "therefore , our simplified thermodynamic approach provides a justification of the minimum enstrophy principle ( and fofonoff flows ) from statistical mechanics when only the microscopic enstrophy is conserved among the infinite class of casimir constraints .",
    "we also derive relaxation equations associated with the various maximization problems mentioned above ( for the reader s convenience , the formal derivation of these relaxation equations is postponed to appendix [ sec_re ] ) .",
    "associated with the basic variational problem , we derive a relaxation equation for the vorticity distribution that increases the mrs entropy at fixed energy , circulation and microscopic enstrophy . in that case , the vorticity distribution @xmath16 progressively becomes gaussian and the mean flow @xmath17 relaxes towards a steady state characterized by a linear @xmath0 relationship . associated with the simplified variational problem , we derive a relaxation equation for the mean flow that increases a generalized entropy ( renyi - like ) while conserving energy , circulation and microscopic enstrophy . in that case , the vorticity distribution is always gaussian , even in the out - of - equilibrium regime , with a uniform centered variance monotonically increasing with time .",
    "associated with the minimum enstrophy principle , we derive a relaxation equation for the mean flow that dissipates the macroscopic enstrophy while conserving energy and circulation .",
    "these relaxation equations can serve as numerical algorithms to determine maximum entropy or minimum enstrophy states with appropriate constraints .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_ptg ] , we study minimum enstrophy states at fixed energy and circulation in rectangular domains .",
    "this problem was first considered by chavanis & sommeria ( 1996 ) @xcite who report interesting phase transitions between monopoles and dipoles depending on the geometry of the domain ( e.g. , the aspect ratio @xmath18 of a rectangular domain ) and on the value of the control parameter @xmath19 . in particular , for @xmath20 , they report a transition from a monopole to a dipole when the aspect ratio becomes larger than @xmath21 . for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the maximum entropy state is always a monopole and for @xmath22 and @xmath24 , the maximum entropy state is a dipole for small @xmath19 and a monopole for large @xmath19 .",
    "they also studied the metastability of the solutions ( local entropy maxima ) and the possible transition between a direct and a reversed monopole .",
    "this work has been followed recently in different directions .",
    "venaille & bouchet ( 2009 ) @xcite have investigated in detail the nature of these phase transitions from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular , they showed that the point @xmath25 corresponds to a bicritical point separating a microcanonical first order transition line to two second order transition lines .",
    "keetels , clercx & van heijst ( 2009 ) @xcite have studied minimum enstrophy states in rectangular or circular domains with boundary conditions taking into account the effect of viscosity .",
    "finally , taylor , borchardt & helander ( 2009 ) @xcite have shown that the two types of solutions appearing in the study of chavanis & sommeria @xcite could explain the process of `` spin - up '' discovered by clercx , maassen & van heijst ( 1998 ) @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec_ptg ] , we recall and complete the main results of the approach of chavanis & sommeria @xcite in order to facilitate the discussion of the last section .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_relax ] , we use the relaxation equations derived in appendix [ sec_re ] to illustrate the phase transitions described in sec .",
    "[ sec_ptg ] . on the basis of the relaxation equations , we observe a persistence of unstable states that are saddle points of entropy .",
    "therefore , we argue that unstable saddle points of entropy may play a role in the dynamics if the system does not spontaneously generate the perturbations that can destabilize them .",
    "we also follow an hysteretic cycle as a function of the circulation where the hysteresis is due to the robustness of metastable states ( local entropy maxima ) .",
    "finally , we briefly describe the possibility of transitions between direct and reversed monopoles in the presence of stochastic forcing .    throughout this paper",
    ", we consider the simple case of incompressible 2d flows without topography .",
