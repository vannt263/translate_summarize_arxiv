    "the spin of an electron , trapped in a self - assembled semiconductor quantum dot ( saqd ) and manipulated by laser pulses , is believed to be a promising qubit candidate for quantum computation and quantum communication .",
    "such qubits can be optically controlled in high speed @xcite and its coherence times has been prolonged to the order of microseconds greilich .",
    "recently , there have been many experimental demonstrations of the key divincenzo requirements @xcite for such qubit , for examples , spin initialization @xcite , the coherent manipulation of electron spins @xcite , and fast spin nondestructive measurement @xcite .",
    "entangling gates for two qubits form an essential ingredient of quantum computation .",
    "significant effort has been invested in theoretical protocols for two qubit gate piermarocchi , calarco , nazir , gauger , emary2,kjxu , puri , lbchen , economou and experimental demonstration of optical entanglement control @xcite between qds .",
    "however there has been no reported experimental realization of optically controlled phase gate between qds . in this paper",
    ", we propose a two - qubit controlled phase gate in a vertical self - assembled quantum dot molecule ( saqdm ) @xcite utilizing adiabatic passage and hole tunneling . compared with our previous scheme @xcite , the using of adiabatic passage efficiently suppressing spontaneous decay from excited states @xcite and need not precisely timing the interval between the two pulses .",
    "our proposal bases on the current generation of saqdms , and the simulation shows the gate can implemented with a fidelity exceeding @xmath0 .",
    "our model is based on the vertically coupled saqds @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the electrons or holes can tunnel between the two dots to create a quantum dot molecule ( qdm ) .",
    "for the qdms discussed here , the nominal height of dot @xmath1 , @xmath2 , is greater than that of do t @xmath3 , @xmath4 , so that dot @xmath5 exhibits the lower transition energy .",
    "this allows the hole levels to be brought into resonance with a positive electric field applied along the @xmath6 axis ( the growth direction ) , while the electron level of dot @xmath3 is shifted to a much higher energy than that of dot @xmath5 .",
    "we use the spin of the electrons in each dot as the qubits . in the faraday geometry , the energy levels for the single qd system in the presence of a small magnetic field @xmath7 along the @xmath8 axis ( perpendicular to the @xmath6 axis ) x.xu,berezovsky .",
    "the two eigenstate states of electron spin , i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are split by the magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "the lowest - energy interband transition is to the trion state @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , consisting of two electrons in a singlet state and a heavy hole .",
    "optical selection dictate that the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) polarization laser could coupled the transition @xmath16 ( @xmath9 @xmath17 ) , and other transitions are forbidden .",
    "the ideal phase gate aims to impose a phase change on the state @xmath18 without affecting the phase of the other three states .",
    "it should also preserve phase coherence for a superposition of the four qd spin states .",
    "this operation can be characterized by the unitary transformation:@xmath19we use the convention that the vertical arrows on the left and right of the comma sign are , respectively , the directions of the spins in dot @xmath5 and dot @xmath3 .    fig .",
    "2 shows the the level diagram of the two quantum dot and gate operation process , which includes three sequential steps :    firstly , the qdm is illuminated with a @xmath14 circularly polarized continuous wave ( cw ) laser @xmath20 propagating in the @xmath21 direction . the laser is tuned such that it could create an exciton in the quantum dot @xmath5 ( only if it is state is @xmath22 ) without affecting the quantum dot @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the qdm under this laser excitation is    @xmath23    where we assume @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the hole tunneling rate between the two dots .",
    "the hamiltonian has a dark state@xmath26if we turn on the @xmath14 circularly polarized laser and increase the @xmath27 slowly , when @xmath28 the state @xmath29 will be adiabatically transferred to the state @xmath30 almost without exciting the media state @xmath31 . in this process",
    ", the states @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not affected by the cw laser @xmath34 .    secondly , we apply a @xmath35 circularly polarized pulse @xmath36 to coupled the state @xmath37 to the state @xmath38 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the qdm under this laser excitation is    @xmath39    starting with the initial state @xmath40 the system evolves at the time @xmath41 to @xmath42at @xmath43 , @xmath44 . in the case @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . the state @xmath48 acquiring a @xmath49 phase , the transition @xmath50 is blocked because of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "finally we slowly turn off the cw laser @xmath34 so that the state @xmath51 can adiabatically transfer back to the state @xmath52 .",
    "the system returns to its original state and only the state @xmath40 acquires the @xmath53 factor , i.e. , controlled phase gate .",
    "to simulate the system s dynamics , we employ master equation of density matrix @xmath54 @xcite        we choose the laser rabi frequencies as @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 $ ] , with @xmath62 ps , @xmath63 mev , and @xmath64 ns@xmath65 .",
    "the dynamics of matrix elements @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , are shown in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath69 does nt change in this process .",
    "it shows that the time of implement the phase gate is @xmath70 ps , if initial state @xmath71 , we calculate the fidelity of the phase gate @xmath72 .",
    "the fidelity can be improved further if the lifetime of the state @xmath73 is increased .",
    "consider this system in a cavity , the state @xmath74 will be off resonant with their cavity modes , @xmath75 can be reduced to 1.25 ns@xmath65 @xcite , the fidelity can be as high as @xmath76 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have proposed an all - optical controlled phase gate which benefits from current generation of qdm and adiabatic passage .",
    "our simulation shows the fidelity of the phase gate is exceeding @xmath0 by using realistic values for all parameters .",
