    "( there are no divergencies in the corresponding green function in that loops . ) finite counterterms , which can be added for the renormalization of the two - point green function of the matter superfield , can be arbitrary .",
    "summation of feynman diagrams , defining the two - point green function of the gauge field in the limit @xmath81 in the massless @xmath0 supersymmetric electrodynamics , is partially made by schwinger - dyson equations and ward identities .",
    "diagrams , which can not be summed by this way , are non - planar and give a nontrivial contribution starting from the three - loop approximation .",
    "calculation of their sum exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory appears to be rather complicated technically and was performed in this paper for a certain ( sufficiently large ) class of diagrams .",
    "this class of diagrams is chosen because for it the technique of calculations is simpler .",
    "the other diagrams probably can be investigated similarly .",
    "it is most important , that there is a summation algorithm , constructed in this paper .",

    "then there are some questions : what is a true reason of this identity ? is it a consequence of some symmetry of the theory ? can the obtained identity together with relation for the green functions ( [ effective_action ] ) be included in a set of identities ?",
    "so far we have no answers to these questions .",
    "moreover , there are some purely technical problems : it is a proof of identity ( [ new_identity ] ) for diagrams , which were not considered in this paper , and of the similar identity in the massive case ( and in particular for diagrams with the pauli - villars fields )",
    ". the existence of such identity can be rather confidently suggested from the explicit calculations .",
    "certainly , it would be also desirable to formulate all the results in terms of the generating functional , but so far we did not manage to do this .",
    "the results , obtained by summation of the perturbation theory series , means , that gell - mann - low function ( [ gl_function ] ) coincides with the exact nsvz @xmath2-function .",
    "( the renormalization of the operator @xmath5 is exhausted at the one - loop . )",
    "also it would be interesting to perform the similar investigation for the supersymmetric yang - mills theory , using higher covariant derivative regularization or simpler similar noninvariant regularization . in the latter case it is necessary to use a special subtraction scheme , which allows to restore the gauge invariance @xcite .",
