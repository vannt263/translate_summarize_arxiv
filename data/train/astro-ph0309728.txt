    "one of the most fundamental properties of a distribution of galaxies is the luminosity function ( lf ) where @xmath17 .",
    "measurements of the galaxy lf have improved over recent years due to the large size of new redshift surveys , such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "for example , norberg et al .",
    "( 2002b ) measured the @xmath18-band lf from a sample of 110,500 galaxies from the 2dfgrs and blanton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measured the r - band lf from a sample of 147,986 galaxies taken from sdss .",
    "the samples of galaxies are now large enough that they can be split into subsamples and the properties of different types of galaxies can be studied in more detail .",
    "projects based on 2dfgrs data include madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who measured the lf as a function of spectral type , norberg et al .",
    "( 2002a ) who studied the dependence of galaxy clustering strength on luminosity , and lewis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who studied the environmental dependence of galaxy star formation rates . in the case of the sdss , nakamura et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have studied the lf as a function of galaxy morphology , hogg et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) have studied the overdensities of galaxy environments as a function of luminosity and color , gmez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have studied galaxy star - formation as a function of environment and goto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied the environment of passive spiral galaxies .",
    "there are many measurements of the lf in many different wavebands and over a wide range of environments .",
    "we restrict our discussion to lfs measured from optical surveys that cover wide areas .",
    "see de lapparent ( 2003 ) for a comprehensive review of lfs .",
    "most of these analyses have focused on the lf of galaxies found in regions with densities equal or higher to the density around field galaxies ( e.g. loveday et al . 1992 ; marzke et al .",

    "2002b ) . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the lf of galaxies found in extremely _",
    "underdense _ environments ( @xmath0 measured on scales of @xmath19mpc ) , which we will refer to as void galaxies .    the reason we wish to study the lf of void galaxies is to shed light on the discrepancies between theory and observation .",
    "cdm models predict the existence of low mass halos in voids ( dekel & silk 1986 ; hoffman , silk & wyse 1992 ) .",
    "if these halos contain dwarf galaxies then the void galaxy luminosity function should have a steep faint end slope .",
    "however , surveys of dwarf galaxies indicate that they trace the same overall structures as ` normal ' galaxies ( bingelli 1989 ) and pointed observations toward void regions have also failed to detect a significant population of faint galaxies ( kuhn , hopp & elssser 1997 ; popescu , hopp & elssser 1997 ) . also , including the effects of photoionization in theoretical models has been shown to restrict galaxy formation , which leads to a lf with a flatter faint - end slope ( benson et al .",
    "however , observationally the shape of the void galaxy lf remains unknown .",
    "grogin & geller ( 1999 ) measured the void galaxy lf for 46 galaxies in regions with density less than half of the mean density ( i.e. @xmath20 ) .",
    "they found that the lf of void galaxies was quite steep , @xmath21 .",
    "this value lies between the steep values predicted by cdm and the shallower values found observationally for galaxies in denser environments .    in this paper",
    "we have a sample of @xmath22 void galaxies selected from the sdss from which the void galaxy lf can be measured .",
    "rojas et al . ( 2003a , b ) has already studied the properties of these galaxies .",
    "they find that void galaxies are fainter , bluer , have surface brightness profiles more similar to late - type galaxies and that they have higher specific star formation rates .",
    "goldberg et al .",
    "( 2003 in prep ) have also investigated the form of the mass function in voids .",
    "they find that the observed mass function is consistent in both shape and normalization with a semi - analytical mass function in an underdense environment with @xmath20 .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : survey ] we describe the sdss and how void galaxies are selected from it . in section [ sec : meth ] we describe how the lf is estimated and present the results in section [ sec : res ] . in section [ sec : lftype ] we consider the lf of different sub - samples of the data , in section [ sec : discuss ] we interpret the results and compare to other studies and in section [ sec : conc ] we give conclusions .",
    "to obtain a sample of 10@xmath23 void galaxies , we use data from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the sdss is a wide - field photometric and spectroscopic survey .",
    "the completed survey will cover approximately @xmath24 square degrees .",
    "ccd imaging of 10@xmath25 galaxies in five colors and follow - up spectroscopy of 10@xmath26 galaxies with @xmath27 will be obtained .",

    "( 2002 ) describes the early data release ( edr ) and details about the photometric and spectroscopic measurements and abazajian et al .",
    "( 2003 ) describes the first data release ( dr1 ) .",
    "technical articles providing details of the sdss include descriptions of the photometric camera ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) , photometric analysis ( lupton et al . 2002 ) , the photometric system ( fukugita et al . 1996 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , the photometric monitor ( hogg et al .",

    "a thorough analysis of possible systematic uncertainties in the galaxy samples is described in scranton et al .",
    "all the galaxies are k - corrected and evolution corrected according to blanton et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and we assume a @xmath28 = 0.3 , 0.7 cosmology and hubble s constant , @xmath29 km s@xmath30mpc@xmath30 throughout .",
    "void galaxies are drawn from a sample referred to as sample10 ( blanton et al .",
    "this sample covers nearly 2000 deg@xmath31 and contains 155,126 galaxies .",
    "we use a nearest neighbor analysis to select galaxies that on scales of 7@xmath32mpc have density contrast , @xmath33 as void galaxies . in the future",
    "we wish to identify void galaxies with even lower values of @xmath34 but with this sample it is not possible .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 for the density around void galaxies is also consistent with other definitions of voids .",
    "for example the voidfinder of hoyle & vogeley ( 2002 ) identifies on scales of 7@xmath32mpc whether galaxies are ` void ' or ` wall ' galaxies .",
    "the void galaxies can reside in voids reqions but even though 10% of galaxies are classified as void galaxies , the void regions still have average values of @xmath36 . other techniques such as the method of el - ad & piran ( 1997 ) or use of tessellation techniques such as the delaunay tessellation described in hoyle et al .",
    "( 2003 in prep . ) could also be used to find void galaxies but currently the geometry of the sdss does not allow these techniques to be used as they require large contiguous volumes .",
    "the exact process of selecting the void galaxies is described in detail in rojas et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "we provide a brief overview , as follows :    first , a volume limited sample with z@xmath37 is constructed .",
    "this is used to trace the distribution of the voids . any galaxy in the full flux - limited sample with redshift z@xmath38z@xmath39 that has less then three volume - limited neighbors in a sphere with radius 7@xmath32mpc and which does not lie close to the edge of the survey",
    "is considered a void galaxy .",
    "galaxies with more than 3 neighbors are called wall galaxies .",
    "flux - limited galaxies that lie close to the survey boundary are removed from either sample as it is impossible to tell if a galaxy is a void galaxy or if its neighbors have not yet been observed .",
    "this produces a sample of 1,010 void galaxies and 12,732 wall galaxies .",
    "these void and wall galaxies have redshifts in the range @xmath40 and , more importantly for the lf , the void galaxies have magnitudes in the range @xmath41m@xmath42 , which we show in the left hand plot of figure [ fig : hist ] .",
    "this sample is referred to as the distant sample .",
    "the sdss observing schedule is to observe narrow ( 2.5 degree ) but long ( @xmath43 degree ) great circles on the sky .",
    "therefore , there is little nearby volume in the sdss and all the galaxies lie close to the sdss boundary .",
    "however , the wider angle updated zwicky catalog ( falco et al . 1999 ) and the southern sky redshift survey ( da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) can be used to trace the distribution of voids locally ( see figure 1 . in rojas",
    "volume - limited samples with approximately the same density as the sdss volume - limited sample are constructed .",
    "these have z@xmath44 .",
    "we apply the same nearest neighbor analysis and identify a further 194 void galaxies and 2,256 wall galaxies .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the galaxies is @xmath45m@xmath46 , shown in the right hand plot of figure [ fig : hist ] .",
    "this sample is referred to as the nearby sample .",
    "the properties of the galaxies that we are interested in are there magnitudes , colors , surface brightness profiles and star formation rates .",
    "the magnitudes that are measured from the sdss are petrosian magnitudes ( petrosian 1976 ) .",
    "more details are given in stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) but basically the petrosian magnitude is the total amount of flux within a circular aperture whose radius depends on the shape of the galaxy light profile , i.e. , the size of the aperture is not fixed so galaxies of the same type are observed out to the same physical distance at all redshifts .",
    "the colors of the galaxies are found using petrosian magnitudes in two bands .",
    "we use the g - r color as the u - band data can be noisy . to estimate the form of the surface brightness profile we use the sersic index ( sersic 1968 ) measured by blanton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . the sersic index , @xmath47 , is found by fitting the functional form @xmath48 .",
    "a value of @xmath49 corresponds to a purely exponential profiles , while @xmath50 is a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the final measurement we consider is the star formation rate , as measured by the strength of the h@xmath13 emission line .",
    "we could also consider other lines such as h@xmath51 , oii , nii .",
    "rojas et al . ( 2003b ) finds that on average the equivalent widths of void galaxies are larger than the equivalent widths of wall galaxies in all of these lines .",
    "as we just want to define a high and low star formation rate sub - samples ( see section [ sec : lftype ] ) , the choice of the line over the others is not critical .",
    "although referred to throughout this paper as the luminosity function , we actually calculate the magnitude function , @xmath52 , which is related to the lf through the relation @xmath53 . to calculate the lf",
    ", we use the maximum likelihood approach of efstathiou , ellis & peterson ( 1988 , swml ) .",
    "similar results were obtained using the v@xmath39 method ( schmidt 1968 ) , apart from at the faint end where the v@xmath39 method is known to be a poor estimator due to sample variance .",
    "we measure the lf of the distant and nearby , void and wall galaxies separately .",
    "the distant and nearby lfs are combined using an error weighted average of the two measurements in the region of overlap .",
    "the lfs of the wall and void galaxy samples are normalized to match the number per square degree of galaxies that would be predicted from the full sdss sample .",
    "approximately 11/12ths of the galaxies are considered wall galaxies and 1/12th are void galaxies ( rojas et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "to measure @xmath54 , m@xmath10 and @xmath13 we @xmath55-fit the void and wall lfs to a schechter function .",
    "we @xmath55-fit the schechter function twice to each lf : the first time , all three parameters are allowed to vary to obtain an estimate of m@xmath6 . the second time , we @xmath55-fit the three parameters again but only over the range m@xmath10 - 1 @xmath38 m@xmath56 m@xmath6 + 5 which means we are fitting the schechter function to the same part of the lf for each sub - sample . we do this because the wall galaxy lf can be measured over a wider range of magnitudes than the void galaxy lf and thus a comparison between the two lfs might not otherwise be fair .",
    "estimates of @xmath13 are most sensitive to the range of magnitudes over which the fits are performed .",
    "even so , the values of @xmath13 found by the restricted range and the full range of magnitudes available agree within 1@xmath57 .",
    "we use two methods to estimate the uncertainties in the lf measurements .",
    "the first method is that of efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , which uses the property that the maximum - likelihood estimates of @xmath58 are asymptotically normally distributed .",
    "an alternative is the jackknife method ( lupton 1993 ) . following blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we construct 18 sub samples of the galaxies .",
    "each sub - sample excludes a different 1/18th of the area of the survey .",
    "we measure the lf of each sample and estimate the error via @xmath59",
    "in figure [ fig : lfs ] , we present the lfs of the void and wall galaxies .",
    "the first thing to notice is that we are able to measure the lf of void galaxies over a wide range of absolute m@xmath60 values , from @xmath2m@xmath61 .",
    "this is only possible due to the large volume of the sdss and the way in which void galaxies were found both locally , using the uzc and ssrs2 , and at higher redshifts .",
    "the amplitudes of the distant and nearby lfs match well in amplitude in the region where they sample the same range of absolute magnitude , as shown in figure [ fig : lfs ] . in the left hand plot",
    ", we show the lfs estimated from the void ( lower amplitude ) and wall ( higher amplitude ) , distant ( solid lines ) and nearby ( dashed lines ) samples . in the right hand side of figure [ fig : lfs ] , we show a combined void ( circles ) and wall ( triangles ) lf .",
    "the errors shown come from the method of efstathiou et al .",
    "the solid lines show best fit schechter function curves .",
    "these are discussed further below .",
    ".fitting a schechter function to the void and wall lfs of the combined ( distant and near lfs combined into one lf ) , distant , and near samples .",
    "the distant samples alone can constrain @xmath62 and m@xmath10 well but can not place strict limits on @xmath13 , whereas the nearby samples constrain @xmath13 better . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]"
