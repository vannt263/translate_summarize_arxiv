    "there have been relatively few @xmath0-body studies devoted to the effects of binaries on the structural evolution of model clusters .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite described a wide range of results with values of @xmath0 which are generally rather modest by modern standards ( though not inappropriate for application to many open clusters ) .",
    "more recent studies include that of @xcite , whose focus was on the evolution of the core radius with age .",
    "generally speaking , however , in recent years the effect of primordial binaries on the structural evolution of rich systems has been studied using approximate methods based on the fokker - planck equation or related approaches .",
    "the study by @xcite [ hereafter gao et al . ] , using the fokker - planck model with finite differences , established an interesting set of parameters which has been taken up by @xcite , using their hybrid gas / monte carlo code , and by @xcite , whose code was pure monte carlo ( with computed binary interactions in the later paper ) .",
    "for all the usual reasons , it is advisable to check the results of approximate methods by means of @xmath0-body simulations , and it is the main purpose of the present paper to do so , based on the standard model defined by gao et al .",
    "we present the results of an extensive set of direct @xmath0-body simulations , performed with up to @xmath4 particles and different ratios for the number of initial binaries to single stars , ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "following an outline of the physical picture in sec .",
    "[ sec : physics ] , the specification of our simulations is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] .",
    "the subsequent two sections contain the main presentation of our results , with emphasis on ( i ) a comparison with the results of gao et al .",
    "[ sec : gao ] ) , and ( ii ) an analysis in terms of the dependence on @xmath0 and on the primordial binary fraction ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ndependence ] ) .",
    "in fact these topics can not be cleanly separated .",
    "for example , the main systematic differences observed with respect to gao et al .",
    "are in the fraction of binaries in the core , and possibly in the size of the core , in the post - collapse phase . after extrapolating our results to the number of particles used by gao et al .",
    ", we clearly observe a lower fraction of binaries in the core ( by around a factor @xmath7 ) .",
    "extrapolation of the core radius is more problematic , however ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : rc ] ) . in this section",
    "we also compare our results with those of other approximate numerical methods , and with the analytical estimate of the core radius due to @xcite .",
    "the last section of the paper provides an extended summary .",
    "for an isolated cluster , the most important characteristics describing the mass distribution are the core radius @xmath8 and the half - mass radius @xmath9 . fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows how both evolve for the case of a plummer model distribution of single stars , all of which have equal mass , with no primordial binaries present .",
    "the half - mass radius remains roughly constant during the core collapse phase , while the core shrinks at an increasing rate until the first core bounce takes place . around this time ,",
    "one or more binaries are formed dynamically , through simultaneous three - body encounters .",
    "the energy production in those binaries halts core collapse , and also initiates an expansion of the half - mass radius . in the post - collapse phase ,",
    "the core expands and contracts dramatically , while new binaries are formed and older binaries are first hardened and then ejected .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the striking difference that primordial binaries make to this simple picture .",
    "the presence of primordial binaries causes the core to shrink roughly twice as fast as in the single - star case .",
    "this effect is largely due to mass segregation : the binaries , between twice as massive as single stars , tend to precipitate toward the center .",
    "in contrast , the core contraction is much less deep in the case of primordial binaries : the core contraction levels off after the core shrinks by less than a factor ten , whereas in the single star case core collapse continues till the core is one hundredth of its original size .",
    "another difference is that in the primordial binary case , the half - mass radius @xmath9 starts increasing very early on , a factor four earlier than in the single star case .",
    "since there is very little mass loss in these early stages of cluster evolution , an increase in half - mass radius indicates an injection of energy into the bulk motion of the stars and the center of masses of the binaries .",
    "this points to an efficient energy mechanism at work , which then also explains the early halting of the core contraction .",
    "this is indeed the physical explanation .",
    "binaries can give off energy in encounters between binaries and single stars ( and also in binary - binary encounters ) , the probability of which is given by the product of the densities @xmath10 of binaries and single stars , whereas the formation rate of new binaries is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "the relevant scales for these densities are set by the ninety degree turn - around distance @xmath12 , which is of order @xmath13 in standard units , far smaller than typical inter - particle distances , even in the core . if we define the interaction densities as the number of particles per unit of volume @xmath14 , and denote them by a hat , we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in a model with primordial binaries ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are comparable , at least in order of magnitude , and it follows that @xmath19 . in other words , at a given density the rate of energy generation by primordial binaries far exceeds the rate of energy generation by binaries that first have to be formed at that density @xcite .",
    "another way of describing the difference between these two forms of evolution is that fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows a collapse to the ` hydrogen main sequence ' , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows a collapse to the ` deuterium main sequence ' , to borrow metaphors from stellar evolution .",
    "let us take a gas cloud of a solar mass , consisting of only hydrogen and helium . when this protostar contracts sufficiently , nuclear reactions in the core will at some point balance the radiation losses at the photosphere .",
    "at this point , by definition the star has landed on the ( hydrogen ) main sequence .",
    "if the star would be made of pure helium , it would shrink further , until it would reach the helium main sequence , where the central temperature and pressure are high enough to generate the same energy at the rate at which it is lost at the surface . in practice , however , protostars never contain pure hydrogen , but typical have a very small admixture of deuterium .",
    "this deuterium can burn to form helium at lower densities and temperatures than hydrogen can , for a similar reason that primordial binaries can ` burn ' gravitationally at lower densities than single stars . as a result",
    ", a contracting protostar first gets hung up at the deuterium main sequence , where it has a radius significantly larger than it will have soon afterwards , when its central deuterium reservoir is burned up , and the star settles on the ( hydrogen ) main sequence .",
    "here we witness something similar : our contracting cluster core settles onto an almost stable extended core configuration , while burning the primordial binaries .",
    "gradually , when this primordial fuel is being exhausted , the core shrinks since the burning process becomes less efficient when the binary fraction becomes less .",
    "this slow shrinking of the core continues until ( almost ) all primordial binaries are burned up , after which the new binaries have to be formed by the process of simultaneous three - body encounters between single stars .",
    "note that the @xmath8 value in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] toward the end is dropping toward the values seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] from the moment of the first core collapse .",
    "this behavior is more evident in fig.[fig : gravo ] .",
    "the models shown in figs .  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , like all those studied in this paper , are isolated , with stars of equal mass .",
    "the initial distribution is a plummer model . in the standard model of gao",
    "et al . , initially 10% of the objects are binaries , as in fig .  [ fig:2 ] , with energies in the range @xmath20@xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the central temperature of the system .",
    "for a plummer model @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mean kinetic energy per particle of the system ( the binaries being replaced by their barycenter ) .",
    "gao et al .",
    "used fokker - planck models with parameters corresponding to @xmath25 particles to study the evolution .",
    "they also carried out runs with the initial fraction of binaries equal to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in this paper",
    "we report on the result of @xmath0-body calculations , which we performed using aarseth s nbody6 code @xcite , which has been slightly modified to provide additional diagnostics on the spatial distributions of single and binary stars ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:3a ] ) . starting from a minimum of 256 particles ,",
    "we have made runs with no primordial binaries , 2% primordial binaries , the three gao et al .",
    "choices of 5% , 10% , and 20% primordial binaries , as well as runs with 50% and 100% primordial binaries ( table [ tab : tb1 ] ) . as in the case of gao et al .",
    ", we have defined here the primordial binary fraction as the fraction of objects that are binaries : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the initial number of binaries and single stars , respectively .",
    "this implies that the fraction of the total mass in binary stars , in the case of equal masses , is larger in the following way : @xmath31 for example , for a run with 10% primordial binaries , @xmath32 whereas @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath0 denotes the number of original objects , i.e. @xmath34 .",

    "all our results are presented using standard units @xcite in which @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the gravitational constant , @xmath39 the total mass , and @xmath40 the total energy of the system of bound objects . in other words",
    ", @xmath40 does not include the internal binding energy of the binaries , only the kinetic energy of their center - of - mass motion and the potential energy contribution where each binary is considered to be a point mass .",
    "the corresponding unit of time is @xmath41 . for the relaxation time",
    ", we use the following expression @xmath42    a quantity of great interest is the core radius , which we here define as in nbody6 , i.e. essentially @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance of the @xmath45th star from the density centre , and the density @xmath46 around each particle is computed from the distance to the fifth nearest neighbour @xcite . in practice outlying stars are omitted from the sum .",
    "the runs were performed using idle time on many workstations through the condor system : this allowed us to obtain in a few months what would have taken a few years on a single dedicated workstation .",

    "most of these values have been estimated quite approximately from the figures in the quoted papers . _ _      the destruction of the binary population is shown in fig .",

    "2a in gao et al .",
    "the destruction of binaries takes place at a quite similar rate in the two models , but escape of single stars is much larger in the @xmath0-body simulations . indeed in the @xmath0-body models",
    "this somewhat diminishes the early _ increase _ in the numbers of single stars which is so prominent in the fokker - planck model , and which is caused by the destruction of binaries ; nevertheless this feature is still visible in our @xmath0-body results . in the hybrid model of @xcite",
    "the number of single stars decreases monotonically , though the residual mass in binaries at @xmath51 is very similar to the value in our fig .",

    "we find that the total potential and kinetic energy of the bound members varies with @xmath56 in a manner very similar quantitatively to the result depicted in their fig .  2 ( @xcite ) .",

    "by the end of their run this group of binaries accounted for about one third of the remaining binaries . in our @xmath0-body simulations ,",

    "simple theoretical ideas show that a binary is liable to be ejected ( in a binary-_single _ interaction ) if @xmath59 @xcite , where @xmath60 is the central potential . for a plummer model",

    "[ fig:2an ] , in good agreement with our results .",
    "the central potential deepens by a factor of only about 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phi0 ] ) .",
    "we consider that the escape of very hard binaries in the @xmath0-body simulations accounts for the main differences between our result ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2an ] ) and that of gao et al . while we find that the distribution of @xmath63 ( at fixed time ) declines at the highest binding energies , in the results of gao et al .",
    "the distribution of binding energy is monotonically increasing .",
    "both kinds of simulation agree in the depletion of less - hard pairs , though in gao et al .",
    "the depletion extends to somewhat harder pairs . to quantify these effects briefly",
    ", we remark that , for @xmath53 , the lower 10 percentile increases by a factor of about 3.5 , and the mean increases by a factor of about 2.3 , which is smaller because of the preferential destruction of softer binaries .",

    "the evolution of the half - mass radius is , if anything , still faster .    within the core the agreement with gao et al .",
    "is poorer .",
    "our values for the density ratio ( in binaries and singles : fig .",
    "[ fig:3b ] ) are considerably smaller than the values found by gao et al . ; those authors find @xmath65 towards the end of the steady binary burning phase .",
    "this quantity is @xmath0-dependent ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : spatial_n ] ) , but we do not consider this sufficient to explain the disagreement .",
    "( extrapolation from our data suggests @xmath66 for the gao et al .",
    "number of particles ) .",
    "from the dynamical point of view the early core contraction and increase in @xmath67 can be seen as manifestations of mass segregation .",
    "@xcite showed that this could lead to equipartition between two species ( here binaries and single stars ) if the initial mass in the heavier species was sufficiently small .",
    "his criterion corresponds , in the present situation , to @xmath68 .",
    "therefore all of the evolution we observe takes place in the regime corresponding to the mass segregation instability .",
    "it is worth considering whether the topics discussed in this subsection and the last are interconnected , i.e. whether the distribution of binding energies is different at different radii .",
    "24 of @xcite implies that the removal of soft pairs mainly affects binaries in the core .",
    "they also find a gap in the numbers of binaries at intermediate radii , which was predicted by @xcite .",
    "these trends seem to be confirmed in our simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : r_eb ] bottom right panel ) , but the number of surviving binaries is too low to draw firm conclusions .      we have already discussed the evolution of the half - mass radius . the evolution of other lagrangian radii is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , which can be compared with fig .  5 in gao et al . , except that the choice of mass fractions differs at some points from theirs .",
    "the differences in the lagrangian radii are at the level of quantitative detail .",
    "for example , we find that the 10% lagrangian radius grows by about 0.1 dex up to @xmath69 , whereas gao et al .",
    "find an increase by about 0.3 dex .",
    "gao et al .",
    "point out that much of the evolution of their model can be described approximately as homological .",
    "part of the evidence for this is their finding that some dimensionless measures of their model vary little over the evolution , even though individual quantities , such as the half - mass radius , may change by large factors .",
    "we find , as do gao et al .",
    ", that the structural parameter @xmath70 is almost constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scaled_e ] ; note the magnified vertical scale ) .",
    "the value of @xmath71 is often adopted for this scaled energy in simple models of bound stellar systems ( @xcite , equation  ( 1 - 10 ) ) .",
    "another important quantity is the central potential , a scaled form of which is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi0 ] .",
    "though our scaling differs from that adopted by gao et al .",
    ", the fractional change between the initial value and the value in the post - collapse phase is comparable .",
    "determination of the time of core collapse requires first a careful operational definition of this term , which is much less clear in these models than it is in the absence of primordial binaries . if @xmath0 is large enough , when @xmath72 there is a deep and sharp core collapse ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , and the determination of the time of core collapse is relatively unambiguous .",
    "it does , however , vary from one simulation to another @xcite . in the presence of primordial binaries the problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : findtcc ] .",
    "the initial collapse of the core is almost linear , and we may determine the point at which this ends ( @xmath73 ) by finding the intersection of two linear fits to the data , for @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "this has been done iteratively .",
    "alternatively , one may attempt to determine the end of core collapse by finding the minimum of @xmath8 .",
    "this requires smoothing of the data , and in general the result will depend on the smoothing interval .",
    "both methods present advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the linear fitting method is very robust for the determination of the first line ( i.e. for @xmath75 ) , which plays the major role for setting the _ time _ of core collapse .",
    "in fact this first line is much steeper than the second ( that fits the core radius in the phase of post collapse ) .",
    "this second fit is more sensitive to the noise and to the extent of the fitting window ( and thus in particular to the end time of the simulation ) , so that the uncertainty associated with the determination of the core _ radius _ at the time of core collapse , defined as the intersection of the two linear fits , is larger than the uncertainty in the time .",
    "it may be also argued that , with this definition , the core radius determination is somewhat artificial , since it does not correspond to a realized ( or averaged ) value in the simulation .",
    "in fact , at the time of core collapse the core radius in the simulation is bigger than the intersection of the two fits ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : findtcc ] ) .    the second method , i.e. the determination of the time of core collapse as the time at which the minimum value of @xmath8 is attained , may be significantly affected by the intrinsic random fluctuations in the measure , due to its sensitivity to the local details of the @xmath76 curve .",
    "after some experimentations , we found that a good choice for minimizing the errors is given by adopting a smoothing window with a width of @xmath77 for @xmath78 and slightly bigger ( @xmath79 ) for @xmath80 .",
    "we note , however , that the local nature of this estimate can play also a welcome role , since to determine the time of core collapse , and the associated core radius , the simulations may be stopped just shortly after core collapse . in contrast , the double linear method requires data for several tens of relaxation times during the postcollapse phase .    to evaluate the relative performance of the two estimators we have applied both methods to a large number of simulations ( a major subsample of the simulations with @xmath81 primordial binaries ; see table  1 ) . as can be guessed from fig .",
    "[ fig : findtcc ] , we found a systematic bias of approximately @xmath82 between the two methods in the measure of the time of core collapse , with the linear fit giving smaller times .",
    "the numerical experiments also confirm that the variance of the measure is marginally smaller ( @xmath83 less ) for the linear fit method ; the results are only very weakly n - dependent .",
    "the values for the core radius at core collapse are , on the other side , similar for the two methods .    in what follows we present results from the second method ( minimum of @xmath8 ) for determining @xmath73 and @xmath84 , and",
    "the possible limitations of its significance need to be borne in mind .",
    "the main reason for choosing this procedure is the fact that this has allowed us to consider as valid simulations all those that reached at least @xmath85 after core collapse .",
    "in fact , while formally all the runs should have lasted for at least @xmath86 , some of them were stopped prematurely due to numerical difficulties .",
    "given the large number of experiments ( see table 1 ) , it was impractical for us to manually restart all the runs that required assistance . for each entry in table 1 we have , however , at least one completed simulation , and on average the completeness of the sample is above @xmath87 .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcc ] . from this figure",
    "it may be concluded that , at a given value of @xmath0 , the time of core collapse is essentially independent of the initial binary fraction @xmath1 , if @xmath88% , and smaller than the collapse time of a model without primordial binaries by a factor of roughly @xmath89 .",
    "this compares well with the expectation based on a two components model with single stars only ( and mass ratio 1:2 ) studied by @xcite , that would predict a relative ratio of the order @xmath90 .",
    "while this lack of dependence on @xmath1 may seem surprising , it should be observed that , at late times in core collapse , the binary fraction in the core has increased considerably ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nbns ] ) , to 50% by number ( or more ) even if @xmath91% initially .",
    "therefore the core is practically saturated with binaries , approximately independent of the initial value of @xmath1 . under these circumstances",
    "it is not surprising that the behavior of the core varies little with @xmath1 .",
    "further evidence of this `` saturation '' effect is visible below in figs.[fig : rcrh ] and [ fig : rc_vc ] .",
    "[ sec : gto ]    @xcite give a plot showing that the `` core - collapse time '' exhibits a roughly linear increase with @xmath1 .",
    "this is quite at odds with our result , but the issue is a semantic one .",
    "@xcite do not call the initial contraction `` core collapse '' , preferring to reserve this term for the deep collapses akin to gravothermal oscillations ; these occur much later , when the binaries are almost fully depleted .",
    "thus the time they discuss might correspond to the deeper collapses in fig .",
    "[ fig : gravo ] after about @xmath92 , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rcrh ] , whereas our figure refers to the end of the initial phase of contraction at about @xmath93 .",
    "the information from our simulations on this topic is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcrh ] .",
    "we notice again a saturation effect for initial binary fractions @xmath94 , and a significant variation with @xmath0 .    to explore these dependences further , we now compare the ratio of the core to half mass radius in the post - collapse phase with the theoretical estimate given by @xcite . by balancing the energy production in the core with the rate of expansion at the half mass radius , they get the following estimate for this ratio ( their eq .  9 ) : @xmath95 where the various quantities are defined as follows .",
    "the quantity @xmath96 is a parameter depending on @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath97 is the ratio of the expansion timescale @xmath99 to @xmath100 , and @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the velocity dispersion in the core and at the half - mass radius , respectively ; we have assumed typical values for these parameters : @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath105 is the binary fraction in the core defined as @xmath106 finally , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are coefficients for the efficiency of binary - single and binary - binary burning and depend on the distribution of binding energy of the binaries .",
    "these coefficients have been computed by a numerical implementation of equation  9 in @xcite , which has been checked against the results given by those authors .",
    "for simplicity , to compute the interaction cross - sections we have assumed a flat distribution in @xmath109 between @xmath110 and @xmath111 kt , where the upper and lower limits have been estimated from the measured binding energy distribution ( see fig .  [ fig:2an ] ) .    for a fixed initial binary fraction @xmath112 this model",

    "[ fig : comparison ] ( @xmath96 is assumed to be constant ) .",
    "clearly the @xmath0-dependence is different .",
    "this result appears indeed rather puzzling .",
    "in fact it is unlikely that differences in the current fraction of binaries in the core , @xmath105 , are responsible , because of the saturation effect .",
    "the @xmath107 and @xmath108 coefficients are also @xmath0-independent , since we have checked that the distribution of binary binding energy , that is the only relevant input , evolves remarkably similarly in simulations with @xmath0 from @xmath113 to @xmath4 . in the worst case , our simplified approach ( i.e. assuming a uniform distribution in @xmath109 for computing the analytical model ) thus introduces only a _ constant _ multiplicative bias in eq .",
    "[ eq : vc ] .",
    "in addition , this bias should be limited , since figs . 5 and 6 in @xcite",
    "suggest that the core radius is not particularly sensitive to the upper and lower limits of this distribution , at least within the limits of variation we observe ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2an ] ) .",
    "other factors which may influence the efficiency of binary heating are the total mass and central potential , but @xmath39 varies with @xmath0 by at most about @xmath114 up to @xmath115 and @xmath116 does not show any systematic trend with @xmath0 ( with an average value , after the core collapse , of @xmath117 in nbody6 units for our runs with @xmath118 ) .",
    "an interesting issue , raised by the referee , is the time scale on which binaries release energy .",

    "in contrast gao et al . report a lower value , @xmath140 , so that this low central velocity dispersion could account for the smaller core in their monte carlo run , although it is not clear what is the origin of such a low velocity dispersion .",

    "it must be borne in mind , however , that the core radius in a multi - component system is not a well defined concept . our data for @xmath145 do not exhibit the slightly puzzling clumping at @xmath146 in fig .",

    "[ fig : nbns ] confirms that the concentration of binaries in the core increases with the original binary fraction , @xmath1 , their overall spatial distribution differs less from that of the single stars , as we consider models with larger @xmath1 . this result",

    "this does not happen in their run with 20% binaries initially ( their fig .  5 ) , where @xmath153 at all times up to the end of their run , at @xmath154 .",
    "this paper has had several objectives .",
    "our first has been to provide evidence from @xmath0-body simulations of the evolution of highly idealised stellar systems containing an initial population of binaries .",
    "the fokker - planck models of gao et al . have become an important touchstone for subsequent modelling , but until now it has not been clear whether any disagreement with their results is due to the simplifying assumptions they made by adopting an approximate method .",
    "what we have tried to do with our simulations is to establish what actually happens , so that subequent research can rest on fewer assumptions and approximations . in this respect",
    "our work can be considered as a stepping stone to improve the physical understanding of the results from more complex and realistic numerical simulations , such as those recently performed by @xcite .    in line with this objective",
    "we have presented detailed results following closely the exposition of gao et al . , which covers the evolution of the structure of the system ( core and half - mass radius , and structural parameters such as the scaled central potential ) , and the evolution of the binaries : their total numbers , their abundance in the core , their energies , and so on .",
    "our second objective has been to begin a discussion of the differences between the various models which have appeared in the literature so far , with particular reference to those of gao et al . , @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "our discussion has covered several of the above issues , and also the gravothermal oscillations which have been observed in almost all simulations , but with somewhat contradictory results for some characteristics , such as the time of onset of the oscillations .",
    "we have also compared our results with some of the small amount of quantitative theoretical predictions in the literature , mainly those of @xcite . with respect to this analytical estimate for the core to half mass radius in the post - collapse phase",
    "we find good quantitative agreement ( at any _ fixed _ value of @xmath0 ) for the dependence on the initial binary ratio . on the other hand",
    "the observed @xmath0-dependence of this quantity is much steeper than one would expect on the basis of the theoretical arguments given by @xcite .",
    "this could be simply a low-@xmath0 effect , but possibly some of the assumptions underlying the model could be inaccurate .",
    "this issue is relevant to the comparison of the core radius between our models and fokker - planck or monte carlo models . with the present data we can not give a clear answer to this point , since either extrapolation or direct simulations with @xmath155 would be required .",
    "a different way of gaining some insight into this problem could be to run some comparison simulations with monte carlo methods with @xmath0 in the range considered in this paper .",
    "if our results would be reproduced , they could be used to indirectly validate monte carlo simulations with @xmath0 high enough to answer this open question .",
    "our third objective has been to attempt to add some new insight and information on the nature of the collisional evolution of stellar systems with an initial population of binaries . in particular",
    "we have considered the time of core collapse ( the definition of which we have attempted to clarify ) . for the period of steady binary burning which follows this initial collapse ,",
    "we have determined the manner in which the core properties ( core radius and binary fraction ) depend on the initial binary fraction and particle number .",
    "it is not clear which of these conclusions are applicable , even qualitatively , to real star clusters , with an initial mass function , a largely unknown initial distribution of binary parameters , a tidal field , and stellar and binary evolution .",
    "for example , @xcite have argued ( on the basis of a simplified treatment of the core ) that the binary fraction in the core of a dense cluster may be as little as 5% , even if @xmath156 initially . now @xcite find ( with a monte carlo code ) that a system in a tidal field with @xmath157 initially disrupts after at most 45@xmath50 . if we were to guess from our fig .",
    "[ fig:2a100 ] , we would conclude that the binary fraction at this time would actually exceed 70% .",
    "of course this argument ignores the essential physical issues of stellar evolution , collisions , etc . , which underly the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , _ all _ these models neglect factors which may be essential .",
    "our next paper on this topic will provide detailed information on one of these which we have ignored so far  the influence of the tide .",
