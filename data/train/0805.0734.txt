    "the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) approach can be used to determine the expectation values of single - particle observables , such as fragment mass , in nuclear reactions and decays but is known to underestimate the fluctuations in these values @xcite .",
    "this is due to the 1-body nature of tdhf and the fact that it neglects 2-body correlations .",
    "this problem has previously been studied by balian and vnroni @xcite , who derived a general variational theory for the determination of expectation values , correlations and fluctuations .",
    "they found that , given the state of a system described , at the time @xmath2 , by the 1-body density matrix , @xmath3 ( a slater determinant satisfying @xmath4 ) , the fluctuation , @xmath5 , in a 1-body observable , @xmath6 , at some later time @xmath7 , is given by @xmath8 , \\label{eqn : bv}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a 1-body density matrix related to @xmath10 through the boundary condition @xmath11 and where the time evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath9 is given by the usual tdhf equation .",
    "this result is significantly different from the standard tdhf result @xmath12 , \\label{eqn : tdhf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in that it depends on the initial time , @xmath2 , with the final time , @xmath7 , entering only through the boundary condition ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) . the other key feature of this result is that it contains , through ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) , the observable @xmath6 such that this method is specifically tuned to the determination of the fluctuation of the observable of interest .    a practical implementation of ( [ eqn : bv ] ) requires that a hartree - fock calculation be performed to determine the initial state , @xmath3 .",
    "the system is then excited by a suitable external excitation , and a tdhf calculation performed from @xmath13 to determine @xmath14 .",
    "this is used to obtain @xmath15 using ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) and a second tdhf calculation is then performed with the tdhf code run backwards , @xmath16 , to obtain @xmath17 .",
    "the transformation ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) and the second tdhf calculation must be repeated for a range of values of @xmath18 to allow @xmath19 to be determined by extrapolation to @xmath20 .",
    "the large number of computations required to evaluate ( [ eqn : bv ] ) and the complexity of these calculations means that only a handful of calculations have been performed using this method and those calculations which have been performed have used simplified interactions and made use of symmetries ( either spherical @xcite , or axial @xcite ) to render the problems tractable .",
    "however , modern advances in computing power mean that this approach can now be implemented using fully 3-dimensional tdhf codes with full skyrme interactions @xcite .",
    "we consider the mass dispersion in a bounded region of space around a giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) which decays through particle emission and calculate the mass ( number of nucleons ) in the nucleus according to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cutoff radius used to define the bounded region of space .",
    "the nucleus was excited by multiplying the ground state wavefunctions from the hf calculation by a dipole boost given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 and where , for protons , @xmath25 , and for neutrons , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the atomic mass number of the nucleus under investigation and @xmath28 is its charge .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 determine the strength of the boost applied to the nucleus .",
    "written in terms of the single particle wavefunctions ( [ eqn : bv ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath32 @xmath33 the wavefunctions @xmath34 were obtained from the results of a static hartree - fock calculation , whilst the wavefunctions @xmath35 result from the backwards tdhf calculations and are related to the wavefunctions @xmath36 through the boundary condition @xmath37",
    "we consider first a gdr in @xmath0s calculated using the skyrme interaction with the sly6 @xcite parametrisation .",
    "all calculations were performed in a cubic model space of size @xmath38 fm discretised in steps of @xmath39 fm .",
    "the initial hf calculation gave a @xmath0s ground state with a total binding energy of @xmath40 mev ( compared with the experimental value of @xmath41 mev @xcite ) and a prolate deformation ( @xmath42 ) .    at the beginning of the dynamic calculation",
    "the ground state wavefunctions were boosted in accordance with ( [ eqn : gdr - boost ] ) and with @xmath43 @xmath44 . the simulation was allowed to run from an initial time @xmath45 fm / c to @xmath46 fm / c in steps of @xmath47 fm / c .",
    "the emitted nucleons were reflected back from the boundary of the box and would , were the simulation allowed to run long enough , re - enter the region occupied by the de - exciting nucleus causing unphysical interactions .",
    "an analysis of the density and of @xmath48 as a function of time was used to verify that the number of nuclei in the nucleus had stabilised well in advance of the time @xmath7 and that the radiated flux had not had enough time to be reflected back and to interact with the nucleus .",
    "the dipole moments , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , were obtained as a function of time using @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53,@xmath54,@xmath55 denotes @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the expectation values for position calculated using the proton and neutron single particle states respectively .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : s32](a ) . due to the prolate deformation of the @xmath0s nucleus ,",
    "the @xmath50 and @xmath51 values are identical and differ from the @xmath49 values .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 allow the excitation energies for the oscillations along each of the three primary axes to be estimated .",
    "in this instance we obtain , for @xmath49 , a period of @xmath61 fm / c giving an excitation energy @xmath62 mev and , for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , a period of @xmath63 fm / c giving an excitation energy @xmath64 mev .",
    "the final state gave @xmath65 with @xmath66 using @xmath67 fm which represents the emission of @xmath68 nucleons .",
    "@xmath22 was chosen so that the bounded region fully enclosed the nucleus but omitted , as much as possible , the extended ( or dissipated ) components of the wavefunctions .",
    "the transformation ( [ eqn : sp - psi ] ) was then applied and the tdhf code was run in reverse .",
    "this process was repeated for @xmath18 values in the range @xmath69 in steps of @xmath70 . at the end of each time - reversed calculation the fluctuation , @xmath71 ,",
    "was estimated using ( [ eqn : sp - bv ] ) .",
    "these values were plotted ( see figure [ fig : s32](b ) ) and a straight line was fitted to the linear section of the graph and extended back to @xmath72 to obtain @xmath73 which represents a @xmath74% increase in @xmath75 using the bv approach compared with the standard tdhf result .",
    "this graph is typical of those obtained using this approach and is linear for larger values of @xmath18 increasing asymptotically as @xmath20 due to the @xmath76 term in ( [ eqn : bv ] ) .",
    "often , as in this case , the curve decreases for intermediate values of @xmath18 where the reduced value of @xmath18 means that the transformation ( [ eqn : sp - psi ] ) only has a small effect making the numerator in ( [ eqn : bv ] ) numerically approximately zero and dominant over the @xmath77 denominator .",
    "these calculations have been repeated for the doubly magic nucleus @xmath1sn .",
    "all the calculations were carried out using the same model space and interaction as the @xmath0s calculation .",
    "the hf calculation produced an undeformed ground state with a binding energy of @xmath78 mev ( compared with the accepted value of @xmath79 mev @xcite ) .",
    "the ground state single particle wavefunctions were boosted at the start of the tdhf calculation in accordance with ( [ eqn : gdr - boost ] ) and with @xmath80 @xmath44 and the calculation was run from @xmath45 fm / c to @xmath46 fm / c as in the previous calculation .",
    "the dipole moments were plotted as a function of time and are shown in figure [ fig : sn132](a ) .",
    "the graph shows @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 to be identical as expected for a spherical nucleus and gives the periodicity of the dipole moments as @xmath81 fm / c which corresponds to a resonance energy of @xmath82 mev .",
    "this is close to the experimentally measured value of @xmath83 mev @xcite .",
    "the standard thdf calculation gave , at the time @xmath7 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 representing the emission of 11 nucleons .",
    "a series of transformations and time - reversed tdhf calculations were carried out as previously . the resulting graph , and linear fit ,",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : sn132](b ) which gives @xmath86 and represents a @xmath87% increase in @xmath75 compared with the standard tdhf result .",
    "the balian - vnroni approach has been implemented for the first time using a 3-dimensional tdhf code with the full skyrme interaction .",
    "calculations have been performed for gdrs in @xmath0s and @xmath1sn and have demonstrated that the bv approach does produce quantitatively larger results for the fluctuations of 1-body operators .",
