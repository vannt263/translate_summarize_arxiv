    "the primordial anisotropy is damped to negligible amplitude due to photon diffusion and the finite thickness of the last scattering surface ( hu & white 1997 ) . on these smaller scales , secondary anisotropies such as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze )",
    "are expected to dominate the signal of the cmb power spectrum ( haiman @xmath10 knox 1999 ) .",
    "studies of secondary anisotropy in the cmb have the potential to be a powerful probe of the growth of structure in the universe .    in this paper , we report results from an ongoing program using the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) interferometer to search for arcminute - scale cmb anisotropy .",

    "analysis of eleven fields observed with the bima array during the summers of 1997 , 1998 , and 2000 revealed a significant detection of excess power ( d2001 ) . in an effort to achieve uniform sensitivity and selection criteria across our sample , we continued the project in the summer of 2001 with a subset of eight fields from the original survey .",
    "two new fields were also added to the survey for a total of ten . each field",
    "was observed with the bima array and the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the two new fields added to the survey , bdf12 and bdf13 , lie at right ascensions convenient for summer observations and outside of the galactic plane .",
    "this makes for a total of ten independent fields for the survey in 2001 , covering approximately @xmath11 square degrees .",
    "the fields were selected from the @xmath12 m and vla nvss  @xcite radio surveys to lie in regions with low dust contrast and no bright radio sources .",
    "in addition , we used skyview to access digitized sky survey and rosat images to check for bright optical or x - ray emission which could complicate follow - up observations .",
    "the pointing centers for each of the ten fields are given in table 1 .",
    "two of the fields used in the d2001 analysis , pc1643 + 46 and vla1312 + 32 , were originally selected to follow - up previously reported microwave decrements ( jones et al .",
    "1997 ; richards et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a third field , in the direction of the high redshift quasar pss0030 + 17 , was originally selected as a distant cluster candidate .",
    "these three fields did not follow the same selection criteria as the rest of the fields and are not included in the present sample . since observations of these fields are not as deep as those for the other blank fields , removing them from the survey does not have a significant effect on the results reported in this paper .",
    "a priority for 2001 observations was to achieve uniform flux sensitivity across the sample of ten fields .",
    "we re - observed fields from the previous years and dedicated @xmath13 hours to each of the new fields , aiming for a uniform noise level of @xmath14jy / beam rms on short baselines ( @xmath15-@xmath16 ) for each field in the sample .",
    "this noise level corresponds to @xmath17k rms for a @xmath18 synthesized beam .",
    "an image of the field bdf13 observed with the bima array is included in figure 1 to illustrate the sensitivity in the @xmath15-@xmath19 range @xmath20 .",
    "all anisotropy observations were made using the bima array at hat creek .",
    "nine @xmath21 meter telescopes of the array were equipped for operation at @xmath22 ghz , providing a @xmath23 fwhm field of view . in order to track phase and gain fluctuations ,",
    "all field observations were bracketed by observations of bright radio point sources ( h2000 ) .",
    "the fluxes of these calibration sources are all referenced to the flux of mars which is uncertain by approximately @xmath24 at @xmath25 confidence ( see discussion in grego 2001 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is small compared to the uncertainty in the anisotropy signals we report here and therefore makes a negligible contribution to the uncertainties in the reported results .",
    "the cumulative integration time for each of the ten fields observed in this survey is listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the result of imaging the field bdf13 using all of the @xmath15-@xmath19 data from the summer of 2001 . this image is a fair representation of the fields in the survey which typically have only @xmath15-@xmath19 data in the range @xmath26 . after calibration and data edits ,",
    "a total of 607 hours of integration have been dedicated to this project .",
    "sources of foreground emission have the potential to contaminate estimates of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "contaminants at @xmath22 ghz arising from galactic sources such as dust , synchrotron , and free - free emission are expected to be below the @xmath27k level at arcminute angular scales in the regions of the sky selected for this survey .",
    "however , emission from radio point sources could contribute significantly to excess power in the observations described here ( e.g. tegmark et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the compact configuration used for the bima anisotropy observations was designed to produce high sensitivity to extended sources . however , this configuration has limited sensitivity on the long baselines which in principle could be used to locate and remove point sources . to help constrain the contribution from point sources to the anisotropy measurements",
    ", we used the vla at a frequency of @xmath28ghz to observe each field in the survey . with @xmath29 hours per field",
    ", these observations yielded an rms flux of @xmath30jy / beam for a @xmath31 fwhm region with the same pointing center as a bima field .",
    "the positions of all point sources with flux @xmath32 within @xmath33 of the pointing center have been recorded .",
    "measured point sources with fluxes corrected for attenuation from the primary beam at @xmath0 ghz are listed in table 2 .",
    "an image of the field bdf13 is shown in figure 3 as an example of observations used to identify point sources from the vla data .",
    "if the spectra of the point sources are relatively flat or falling , deep observations with the vla will identify those that lie near the noise level in the @xmath22 ghz maps .",
    "however , it is possible that a radio source with a steeply inverted spectrum may lie below the vla detection threshold but still contribute to the observations at @xmath22 ghz .",
    "advection dominated accretion flows are thought to be the most common inverted spectrum sources .",
    "they typically have a slowly rising spectrum , with a spectral index of @xmath34 to @xmath35 ( perna and dimatteo , 2000 ) .",
    "such a shallow spectrum would only provide a factor of two increase in flux between @xmath0 ghz and @xmath22 ghz .",
    "the analysis in this paper is similar to that used to produce the previous bima anisotropy results and is based on the formalism presented in white et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the determination of the cmb power spectrum from interferometer data .",
    "we bin the visibility data and calculate joint confidence intervals as described in h2000 . the likelihood function to test a theory for a set of bandpowers , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 measured visibilities is defined @xmath38 \\quad , \\label{eqn : likelihood}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the correlation matrix of visibilities at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "we then perform an analysis with data divided into two bins , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , corresponding to different spatial resolution .",
    "a constraint correlation matrix is introduced to account for the point sources identified with the vla . in this new formalism , the correlation matrix can be represented as @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the theory correlation matrix , @xmath47 represents the noise correlation matrix , and @xmath48 represents the constraint correlation matrix used to remove the effect of point sources from the determination of the cmb power spectrum .",

    "following white et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we define the visibility correlation matrix , @xmath55 which is proportional to the product of the power spectrum , @xmath56 , and the visibility window function .",
    "the window function is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the fourier transform of the telescope primary beam .",

    "what effect this uncertainty has on the analysis , we both increased and decreased each term in the noise correlation matrix by @xmath80 and found no significant change in estimates of excess power .",
    "as discussed in d2001 , the effectiveness of subtracting point sources directly from the visibility data is limited with the compact configuration of the bima array . using the vla at @xmath0 ghz",
    ", we can identify the positions of point sources which might contaminate the visibility data .",
    "we introduce a constraint correlation matrix ( bond et al .",

    "if the signal observed in the bima fields is indeed caused by cmb anisotropy , there are a host of possible sources for excess power such as primary anisotropy , thermal sze , kinetic sze , patchy reionization , and the ostriker - vishniac effect .",
