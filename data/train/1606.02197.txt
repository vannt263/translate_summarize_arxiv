    "the study of correlations in quantum systems has indeed a long , deep and complex history .",
    "in particular , enormous efforts have been devoted to characterizing the `` quantumness '' of correlations , or devising measures of correlations aimed at capturing the `` quantum content '' of correlations present in a generic quantum state , such as quantum entanglement@xcite and quantum discord@xcite .",
    "three premises underlie the derivation of such measures : @xmath0 in a quantum state there can be `` classical '' and `` quantum '' correlations that coexist ; @xmath1 it is possible to algorithmically identify and separate the quantum vs the classical part of the correlations @xmath2 both parts can be quantified by means of a single number . in agreement with these assumptions ,",
    "the measures of correlations have been used to establish a classification of _ _ quantum states _ _ based on clear - cut distinction between quantum vs classical states ( e.g. , separable vs entangled states , discordant vs zero - discord states ) .",
    "furthermore , the correlation measures have been put in direct connection with the efficiency of specific quantum protocols , as measured by suitable figures - of - merit .",
    "an additional premise is implicit in this effort : @xmath3 quantum correlations , interpreted as properties of a given quantum state as a whole , underlie the efficiency of quantum protocols .",
    "however , the strategy that follows the above premises is sometimes unable to unequivocally provide a connection between the performance of the protocol and a given measure of quantum correlations .",
    "therefore , the search for other perspectives is indeed possible and it is in order . in particular , we propose to `` forget '' about the quantum vs classical distinction , and rather focus on _ ( classical ) correlations between sets of local observables_. our proposal is based on an idea that has been highlighted within the framework of the consistent ( decoherent ) histories approach to quantum mechanics@xcite ( and sometimes also within the standard interpretation@xcite ) .",
    "the state @xmath4 of a system , rather than a `` property '' of the system , can be intended as a `` pre - probability '' i.e. , a mathematical device useful in order to calculate the probabilities of measurement outcomes pertaining to ( possibly incompatible ) experiments . in a bipartite setting for example , where a and b share a given state @xmath5@xmath4 and they want to implement a communication task , the probability distributions pertaining to all pairs of local observables define the set of `` available correlations '' stored in the state .",
    "when a specific protocol is enacted , one is led to identify the subset of pairs of local observables that are relevant for its realization , and therefore the corresponding subset of _ relevant correlations_. in this sense , a bipartite state can be imagined as a multiple - inputs / multiple - outputs system@xcite i.e. , a communication system that can exploit several parallel channels linking the transmitter and the receiver ; the `` relevant channels '' are those identified by the pairs of local observables that are relevant for a given protocol . in this perspective , on one hand _ _ quantum states can be characterized as a whole by the average amount of ( classical ) correlations between all pairs of local observables , whose value depends on the state purity , and the symmetry of the correlations distribution . on the other hand , the efficiency of specific _ _ quantum protocols _ _ can be connected with specific sets of local observables and their mutual correlations . in this way one",
    "is able to find protocol - specific measures of correlations and , as we demonstrate in a specific example , to modify existing protocols in order to enhance their efficiency .",
    "+ while our approach is general and in principle applicable to multipartite settings , in order to thoroughly examine the proposed strategy , here we focus on the simplest case of quantum communication bipartite channels provided by two - qubit quantum states @xmath6 , where the tensor product structure @xmath7 naturally provides the sets of local observables to study .",
    "in particular , we start our analysis by focusing on states with maximally mixed marginals ( mmms ) .",
    "the latter are particularly simple to study and yet they have been widely used in the literature as prototypical instances of bipartite communication channels @xcite .",
    "we will consider pairs of local von neumann observables and their correlations , as measured by the classical mutual information @xmath8 of measurement outcomes . on the basis of @xmath8 , in the first place",
    "we define a measure of the `` available correlations''by taking a suitable average @xmath9 over the manifold @xmath10 of local observables ( which , in the case of two qubits , are given by the product of two spheres @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , two states , with possibly different purities , can well have the same amount of average correlations @xmath9 ( just as two states can have the same amount of entanglement or discord ) but _ they can be strikingly different from the point of view of how the correlations are distributed among the various observables_. in this perspective , bipartite quantum states _ _ can be classified on the basis of both the purity dependent quantity given by the _ average correlations _ , and by the purity independent feature given by the _",
    "symmetry _ of the correlations distribution .",
    "furthermore , it possible to introduce a relation between the correlations of the pairs of observables and the coherence of the product bases they define .",
    "in this respect we show that at fixed purity _ correlations and coherence can be in general identified as complementary resources_.   + to assess the role of correlations in a quantum protocol , @xmath9 may not be the most significant quantity .",
    "when one analyzes a given communication task , one should spot out the set of observables that are relevant for its realization .",
    "this is for example possible when there exists a figure of merit @xmath12 for the protocol that explicitly depends on a specific subset of observables , i.e. , a set @xmath13 of _ relevant observables _ ( ro ) .",
    "if this is the case , then one can immediately derive a protocol - related measure of correlations by taking the average @xmath14 on this subset only .",
    "from the conceptual point of view , our perspective is radically different from others : instead of considering an overall property of the state , such as the entanglement , the discord or the average mutual information @xmath9 , we establish a direct connection between the ( average ) performance of the protocol and the correlations pertaining to the relevant observables . in the following",
    "we will fully develop a first example of this method by applying it to the ( two - qubit ) remote state preparation ( rsp ) protocol @xcite .",
    "the latter has been largely studied in the literature and there have been many attempts to link its performance to specific kinds of quantum correlations - such as quantum discord @xcite or entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , it has been showed that on one hand discord is neither sufficient nor necessary for the efficiency of the protocol @xcite , and on the other hand that states with lower content of entanglement or discord can provide better efficiency than states with higher values of both quantities @xcite . in our case",
    ", we will analyze the protocol for both mmms and general non - mmms states .",
    "we will define a functional @xmath12 for rsp that allows us to identify the set of relevant observables . while for states with maximally mixed marginals ( mmms ) all relevant observables are useful , i.e.",
    ", they can always be used to enhance @xmath12 , for general non - mmms only a subset of the relevant observables has this property .",
    "one can therefore define the set of _ useful observables _ _ _ @xmath15 and _ _ correspondingly introduce an alternative way of enacting rsp based on useful observables only , such that the overall efficiency of the protocol is improved .",
    "i___n both cases ( mmms and non - mmms ) , _ _ _ we measure the advantage of using the correlations vs not using them by means of a gain function @xmath16 that explicitly depends on the correlation of the useful observables",
    ". the average gain will provide the link with the desired measure of correlations pertaining to the protocol .",
    "+ throughout the whole discussion we analyze how purity vs the symmetry of correlations affect the protocol . in general purity and symmetry of correlations can be thought as two fundamental resources : the purity fixes the amount of available correlations ; the symmetry determines how the correlations are distributed among the relevant observables . as for symmetry alone , we finally show how it can be recognized as the key resource that allows to establish the communication channel between the parties a and b _ before _ the state one wants to transfer is known .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ sec : preliminaries ] ) we briefly define the formalism and the conventions used . in section ( [ sec : symmetry - and-(average )",
    "mutal info ] ) we introduce our measure of correlations and we study the general properties of @xmath17 and their relations with the state s symmetry for mmms .",
    "readers mainly interested in rsp can skip this section and go directly to section ( [ sec : relevant - observables , pay off and gain ] ) , where we discuss in detail the rsp protocol for mmms and non - mmms . in section ( [ sec : rsp and symmetry ] ) we finally discuss the relation between symmetry and how freedom in implementing the different steps of rsp . in section ( [ sec : conclusions ] ) we derive our conclusions .",
    "we start by discussing how two - qubit quantum states can be characterized on the basis of the pairwise correlations between local observables , @xmath18 . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on a subset of states , those with maximally mixed marginals ( mmms ) .",
    "we show that mmms can be characterized by the average @xmath17 as well as the symmetry of @xmath18 , as defined below .",
    "finally , we discuss how the correlation content described by @xmath18 is complementary to the coherence of product basis defined by @xmath19 in a given the state .      by using the bloch - fano representation",
    ", one can show that an arbitrary two - qubit state is equivalent , up to local unitary operations @xmath20 , to the state :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the bloch vectors of the marginal states , and @xmath24 is the correlation matrix in its diagonal form , and @xmath25 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "therefore , the state is identified by three vectors : the vectors @xmath26 describing the reduced density matrices @xmath27 and the correlation vector @xmath28 . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on maximally - mixed marginal states ( mmms ) , defined as the states with for which @xmath29 , and which hence have maximally mixed reduced states on @xmath30 :    @xmath31 mmms are completely characterized by the correlation vector @xmath32 .",
    "the condition for @xmath6 to be a good quantum state is the positivity condition @xmath33 .",
    "the latter implies that @xmath34 i.e. , @xmath32 is a vector in @xmath35 contained in the tetrahedron @xmath36 with vertices @xmath37@xcite .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath38 defines the purity of the state that reads @xmath39 .",
    "+ in the following we will focus on pairs of von neumann observables .",
    "the latter are operators that can be represented as @xmath40 , @xmath41 being a complete orthogonal set of projectors on the hibert space @xmath42 .",
    "since we are dealing with qubits any projector can be written in terms of pauli matrices as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a unit vector belonging to a single qubit bloch sphere , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we are interested in the correlations between pairs of observables @xmath47 ( pertaining to the subsystem @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively ) , whose projectors are defined as @xmath50 .",

    ", the mutual information between two local observables @xmath19 in mmms can be simply expressed as    @xmath60 where @xmath61 . from this formula",
    ", it immediately follows that the correlations between any two observables are a monotonic function of @xmath38 i.e. , of the purity , and that for any fixed @xmath38 the distribution of correlations between different pairs of observables depends on the direction of the correlation vector @xmath62 .",
    "states , identified by their @xmath62 , can be classified on the basis of the distribution of correlations they yield .",
    "+   + a first classification of the states and the corresponding directions @xmath62 can be done on the basis of the local symmetries of the correlations , that follow from the local symmetries for the state .",
    "a state @xmath4 has a local unitary symmetry if there are local unitaries @xmath20 such that @xmath63 .",
    "the local unitary symmetries of the state form a group @xmath64 called local unitary stabilizer @xcite , which is a discrete or continuous subgroup of @xmath65 .",
    "local unitaries @xmath66 acting on the hilbert space can be mapped to rotations @xmath67 acting on the bloch sphere : indeed , there exists a ( unique ) rotation @xmath67 such that @xmath68 . by virtue of this @xmath69 mapping ,",
    "local unitary symmetries can be expressed in terms of _ special orthogonal _",
    "transformations that leave the correlation matrix invariant : @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the fact that a state defined by @xmath32 has symmetry group @xmath64 can be viewed in two equivalent ways .",
    "on one hand , for all @xmath19 also @xmath72 is left invariant by the action of @xmath64 on @xmath4 . on the other hand , local symmetries of the state",
    "imply a symmetry in the distribution of correlations : given a pair of local observables @xmath73 , all the pairs @xmath74 have the same value of mutual information .",
    "+ given a direction @xmath62 with a specific @xmath64 , we are interested in identifying the equivalence class of directions that for fixed @xmath38 ( purity ) yield isomorphic distributions of correlations . formally , for any fixed @xmath38 and any given @xmath62 , we want to identify the directions @xmath75 such that for any pair of observables @xmath73 there exists a pair of observables @xmath76 such that @xmath77 , i.e. , there exists a bijective map @xmath78 , realizing a change of local coordinates on the bloch spheres , such that @xmath79 .",
    "thus , given a direction @xmath80 , we want to identify the following equivalence class @xmath81 of directions @xmath82 :    @xmath83    in order to identify the components of a given class one has to notice that a local change of coordinates on the bloch spheres @xmath84 corresponds to a pair of now _ orthogonal _ transformations @xmath85 acting on @xmath19 as @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in order to have @xmath88 we must have @xmath89 which can be rewritten as @xmath90 equation ( [ eq : samedistribution ] ) severely constrains the form of @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , since the matrices @xmath91 and @xmath92 are related by two orthogonal rotations as above , they must have the same singular values .",

    "+ in ref.@xcite a complete classification of the continuous @xmath64 for @xmath107-qubit states was given ; starting from such classification we identify the following classes of mmms :    1 .",
    "@xmath108 states ( `` isotropic states '' ) : they belong the class @xmath81 with @xmath109 . these states are invariant with respect to local unitaries of the kind @xmath110 and we define the class as @xmath111 ; it holds @xmath112 .",
    "bell and werner states belong to this class of isotropic states .",
    "@xmath113 states : they are equivalent to @xmath114 ; these states are invariant with respect to that subset of local unitaries of the kind @xmath115 ; we define the class as @xmath116 , which has @xmath117 elements if @xmath118 and @xmath119 elements if @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 states : they are equivalent to @xmath122 ; these states are invariant with respect to that subset of local unitaries of the kind @xmath123 where in general @xmath124 .",
    "we define the class as @xmath125 , which has @xmath126 .",
    "this class coincides with the mmms states that are called `` classical '' in the literature because they are diagonal in a product basis and have zero quantum discord .",
    "the above classes constitute a fine - graining of the local stabilizer formalism .",
    "for example , while in our case @xmath116 define different classes for different values of @xmath127 , since they give rise to inequivalent distribution of correlations , they are all equivalent in the local stabilizer setting .       for @xmath121 ( red ) and",
    "@xmath108 ( green ) .",
    "the average shows a weak dependence on the symmetry class of the states ( see text for discussion ) ]    given the above classification we now pass to analyze the average amount of pairwise correlations between observables as measured by the average mutual information    @xmath128    where the average @xcite is taken over @xmath129 i.e. , the bloch spheres for the two qubits where the observables are identified by the unit vectors @xmath19 .",
    "the study of this function will allow us to identify , among the above classes of states , those that are extremal with respect @xmath17 .",
    "evidently , for a fixed direction of the correlation vector @xmath62 the average @xmath17 is a growing function of @xmath38 i.e. , of the state purity . in order to perform the average",
    ", we can first evaluate the average over @xmath130 only .",
    "to this aim , we use the expansion @xmath131 and the fact that @xmath132 to obtain @xmath133    integrating with respect to @xmath130 , we get @xmath134 , with @xmath135 . upon resumming the series , the overall average mutual information @xmath136 for a single observable @xmath44 can be thus evaluated as    @xmath137    @xmath136 is a monotonically growing function of @xmath138 and we have @xmath139 .",
    "the average mutual information @xmath17 can be obtained by further averaging with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "the average can be expressed analytically only in simple cases . for states @xmath121 ,",
    "we get    @xmath140    where @xmath141 is the lerch transcendent function ; for the isotropic states @xmath108 ,    @xmath142    at fixed @xmath38 , @xmath121 and @xmath108 are found to be extremal in terms of the average correlations .",
    "indeed , one can study some general properties of mmms with respect to @xmath143 as a function of @xmath144 .",
    "the results can be summarized in the following proposition .    for fixed @xmath145 he states with minimal @xmath143",
    "are @xmath108 and the states with maximal @xmath143 are @xmath121 . if @xmath146 , the minima remain in correspondence of @xmath108 , while the maxima are to be found on the intersection between the sphere of radius @xmath38 and the tetrahedron @xmath36 .",
    "the proof of proposition 1 can be found in appendix [ sec : appendix - b ] . in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath143 for @xmath108 and @xmath121 . from this plot , one can see that for @xmath145 the value of @xmath143 is essentially determined by the purity of the state and has weak dependence on the direction @xmath62 .",
    "this fact dims the relevance of the symmetry properties of the correlations distribution , which becomes quite evident when one considers a specific communication protocol , for which only a specific subset of correlations is relevant .",
    "for example , the effect of the symmetry is very apparent when one considers the subset of maximally correlated observables i.e. , the subset @xmath147 defined by @xmath148 . for the classes @xmath149 identified above :    * for the @xmath121 _ _ , @xmath150 _ _ is defined by the equation @xmath151 which is satisfied only if @xmath152 .",

    "* for the _",
    "@xmath108 , @xmath150 _ is defined by the equation @xmath161 , which is satisfied if the direction of the two observables coincide .",
    "thus , @xmath162 with @xmath163",
    ".    it is evident that therefore the symmetries can have important implications for protocols based on maximally correlated observables , as it will become clear in the discussion about rsp , see for example figures ( [ fig .",
    "2 ] ) and ( [ fig . 3 ] ) and the related discussion .",
    "an important aspect of the correlations between between observables @xmath73 is that they can be seen as complementary to the coherence properties of the product basis identified by @xmath19 i.e. , @xmath164 , with respect to the given state . in order to assess this point",
    "one can use the coherence function@xcite given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the entropy of the joint probability distribution obtained by a measurement of the observables identified by @xmath19 .",
    "for mmms , we obtain @xmath167 with @xmath168 the von neumann entropy of @xmath4 .",
    "the above formula establishes a clear link between the correlations between local observables and the coherence of the product bases they define .",

    "therefore communication protocols involving mmms and that are based on @xmath73 pairs can in principle be divided in two different categories : those that rely on correlations and those that rely on coherence .",
    "although this subdivision is in principle sharp , we will see that the rsp protocol for example falls in the first category . in",
    "@xcite we have provided an example of protocol that falls in the second category : quantum phase estimation , which turns out to be based on coherence rather than correlations .",
    "+ the third property descends from the fact that @xmath168 is invariant with respect to any unitary rotation in @xmath180 , and it allows to extend the discussion already made about @xmath181 and @xmath182 to @xmath169 and @xmath170 ( where the average is taken over the two bloch spheres ) since they inherit the same symmetry properties . + the fourth property marks a difference between the set of states that are locally unitarily equivalent to @xmath183 and those that are unitarily equivalent to @xmath184 : they both have the same purity , and therefore same linear entropy , but in general different @xmath185 , since the transformation @xmath105 does not preserve the spectrum of @xmath4 . for the states that have the higher @xmath185 the pairs @xmath73 have the lower coherence ; a property which is consistent with the fact that states with higher values of @xmath185 are more `` mixed '' or entropic when one considers them in terms of their global @xmath180 property @xmath168 that depends on the spectrum . + the fifth property is analogous to the same property for @xmath181 and @xmath182 , since @xmath186 is constant for fixed @xmath38 .",

    "therefore , _ by using the same resources and a so - called classical mixed state ( zero discord and entanglement ) one can obtain the same performance one gets with a pure bell state_. the main and relevant difference is that now @xmath418 i.e. , @xmath48 has to set up the channel _ after she gets to know both @xmath189 and @xmath130 . _",
    "+ the bottom line of the above discussion is that , in the described setup ( perfect channel ) , it is the way the correlations are distributed among the relevant observables that matters in defining : @xmath0 which kind of freedom one has in realizing the different steps of the protocol and @xmath1 in which way one has to use the same @xmath387 rotations .",
    "the modified protocols for states @xmath419 do not change the correlation content of the states ; they make use of the same ability of performing @xmath387 rotations as in the original protocol ; the rotations now are used in a way that compensates the lack of symmetry in the states , in order to reorient the correlation distribution among the different observables such that the protocol , as dummy as it may appear , is as efficient as possible with the given purity . in particular ,",
    "in the case of the state @xmath121 the protocol is as efficient as the one that makes use of pure bell states .",
    "the above results seem to depend on the different symmetries of the states , rather than the supposed `` quantumness '' or `` classicality '' of the states . indeed the freedom in the choice of @xmath389 is guaranteed by the symmetry of the distribution of correlations between the relevant observables ( the ones that are perfectly correlated or anti - correlated ) .",
    "the states with isotropic correlations allow for a total freedom for all values of purity , even in absence of entanglement .",
    "these states are always discordant , but here the presence of discord simply records the presence of a sufficient amount of the `` right symmetry '' .",
    "+ we finally note that , in principle , it depends on a s willing or needs ( and on the specific technology at hand ) to decide when to set up the channel . once the kind of channel to be used is fixed , the performance of the protocol only depends on the ability of creating a state with the highest possible purity and to properly implement the rotations and measurements needed .",
    "+ having identified the relevant correlations and their symmetry as those that determine the performance of rsp , if one relaxes the hypothesis of a perfect channel , one may argue that the noisy channels that are optimal are not in general those that preserve entanglement or discord . on the contrary they are those that preserve the amount of relevant correlations and the symmetry ( isotropy ) of the state .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new measure of correlations based on the average classical mutual information @xmath420 between local von neumann observables .",
    "we have illustrated our measure focusing on the case of two - qubit systems . to analyze its properties we defined classes of maximally mixed marginals two - qubit states ( mmms ) with different continuous symmetries . at fixed purity ,",
    "the states belonging to each class have the same value of @xmath420 and their distributions of @xmath18 among the various observables are isomorphic . at fixed purity ,",
    "the states that give the minimum value of @xmath420 are isotropic states , while those that attain the maximum are those with a single non zero singular value in their correlation tensor ( the so called `` classical states '' ) .",
    "any pair of local observables @xmath73 defines a product basis @xmath421 and we showed for mmms that the higher @xmath18 the lower the coherence @xmath172 of the corresponding basis .",
    "in other words , the ( average ) correlations of mmms and their ( average ) coherence are complementary resources : protocols that require the maximization of @xmath18 , correspondingly require a minimization of @xmath172 .",
    "we conjecture that such a distinction _ _ may have a general character and that correlations and coherence may play a complementary role in quantum information protocols , in the sense that some of them ( or some parts of them ) should be based on the maximal amount of correlations between the relevant observables , and they correspondingly require the least amount of coherence , while on the contrary others should be based on the coherence properties of the relevant observables . _ _ + in the rest of the paper , we introduced a general standard scheme for identifying proper measure of correlations for protocols whose figure - of - merit @xmath227 explicitly depends on a given set @xmath234 of pairs of observables @xmath73 i.e. , the set of _ observables _ _ relevant _ for the protocol .",
    "the measure of correlations is obtained by defining a gain function @xmath16 that expresses the benefit in using vs not using the correlations present in the state @xmath6 employed in the protocol .",
    "this perspective has a series of consequences .",
    "indeed , on one hand the measure of correlations becomes protocol - dependent ; on the other hand the described procedure allows one to derive `` proper '' measures of correlations in a standard way for each protocol .",
    "ultimately , the condition of being `` proper '' stems from the explicit connection one is able to make between the measure of correlations and the figure - of - merit @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we notice that when a state is sent through a noisy channels the overall properties of the state are in general corrupted while , depending on the specific kind of noise , the relevant correlations may well be preserved .",
    "+ we illustrated our scheme by specializing it to an example of quantum communication task , remote state preparation ( rsp ) , for which both discord and entanglement are not able to capture the relevant features that allow to maximize the performance . in the case of mmms",
    "we introduced a specific figure - of - merit @xmath227 , defined the set @xmath234 and showed that @xmath422 for @xmath423 ; therefore the measure of correlations pertaining to the protocol is just @xmath424 i.e. , the average mutual information between the relevant observables .",
    "the resources involved in the process are the purity of the state and the symmetry of the correlations .",
    "we found that the extremal states are the isotropic ones : at fixed purity they allow to obtain the optimal value of @xmath244 with the least amount of @xmath425 i.e. , with the least amount of the resources ( correlations ) used .",
    "we then extended our scheme to general ( non - mmms ) two - qubit states .",
    "the definition of @xmath426 parallels that for mmms , and it shows that the relevant observables and correlations are those pertaining the state @xmath427 i.e , the mmms obtained from @xmath6 by setting the local vectors @xmath26 to zero .",
    "one has that @xmath274 is a function of @xmath428 i.e. , the average mutual correlation between the relevant observables evaluated for the state @xmath427 .",
    "therefore , @xmath428 is the desired measure of correlations .",
    "furthermore , for non - mmms the study of @xmath12 allows one to identify among the relevant observable the set of those that are indeed _ useful _ @xmath429 and correspondingly to define the @xmath430 .",
    "we have shown how to use our approach to devise an optimized protocol that attains in average better values of @xmath12 in a given range of parameters defining the state @xmath6 .",
    "our treatment of rsp allows finding a proper measure of correlations that applies to all states , identifying classes of states that have the same performance and discriminating those classes that allow to obtain the best performance at fixed purity .",
    "the optimality of isotropic states has a general character : the average performance @xmath431 of the protocol is determined by the purity of the state and by the way ( symmetry ) in which the useful correlations are distributed .",
    "the idea of analyzing and classifying correlations in terms of classical mutual information , its average over observables and its symmetries does not depend on the structure of the set of two - qubit states and observables .",
    "as such , it may be extended to two - qudit and n - qubit systems , and provide insights into the general structure of quantum correlations@xcite .",
    "in addition , our approach to derive protocol dependent measures of correlations in a standard way may be fruitfully applied to other relevant protocols .",
