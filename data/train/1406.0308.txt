    "the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments has the potential to not only determine the remaining unknowns in the pmns matrix but also to measure its parameters with unprecedented precision .",
    "this will mark the beginning of a period of high - precision neutrino physics , where the standard paradigms describing the neutrino sector will be put to proof and theoretical ideas about the origins of neutrino mass and leptonic flavour can be confronted with data .",
    "one of the more popular beyond the standard model ideas applied to the neutrino sector is the introduction of a discrete flavour symmetry .",
    "models based on this principle have been shown to be able to derive the observed structure of the pmns matrix from a small set of assumptions .",
    "these models generally propose a discrete symmetry ( _ e.g. _ @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) which is broken spontaneously , leaving residual symmetries amongst the leptonic mass terms .",
    "these symmetries reduce the degrees of freedom amongst the mixing parameters , generating a pattern of falsifiable predictions . by",
    "hypothesizing which symmetries of the leptonic mass terms are residual , this idea can be used to reconstruct the flavour group independently of many model specific assumptions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that a quite general construction of this type ( first presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) leads to only @xmath4 viable models in light of the current global oscillation data .",
    "these models fix a column of the pmns matrix which , under the assumption of unitarity , can be expressed in terms of two constraints on the pmns parameters : the _ atmospheric sum rule _ , relating @xmath5 to @xmath6 and @xmath0 , and the _ solar prediction _ , an expression for @xmath7 in terms of @xmath6 alone . in this contribution",
    ", we shall discuss the parameter correlations of these models , and how they can be constrained by the next generation of high - precision oscillation experiments .",
    "we shall employ the notation @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite throughout .",
    ".[tab : solar_pred]the solar predictions for the @xmath4 viable models identified in ref .",
    "the model label denotes the flavour group and the pattern of breaking ; for details , see ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the atmospheric sum rule can be written in a linearized form by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants expressible in terms of the group theoretic parameters of each model . to test these relations , we require a strong precision on the parameter @xmath0 , which necessitates the consideration of the next generation of long - baseline experiments . these proposals seek to make accurate measurements of the appearance channels @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are sensitive to the value of @xmath0 at a subdominant level .",
    "although it remains a challenging measurement , two leading designs have been shown to offer significant sensitivity to @xmath0 : superbeams and neutrino factories .",
    "such facilities would be able to constrain the atmospheric sum rules over a significant fraction of the available parameter space .",
    "for example , an on - axis superbeam with a detector mass of @xmath16  kton ( @xmath17  kton ) and a baseline of @xmath18  km would be capable of excluding models with @xmath19 and @xmath20 for over @xmath21@xmath22 ( @xmath23@xmath24 ) of the parameter space , depending on the true value of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we shall consider a circa @xmath1  km reactor experiment based on the jiangmen underground neutrino observatory ( juno ) @xcite and reactor experiment for neutrino oscillations ( reno-50 ) designs @xcite .",
    "these facilities will be capable of high precision measurements of the @xmath25 disappearance probability .",
    "the main goal of such experiments is to observe the subdominant oscillations whose phase depends upon the mass hierarchy .",
    "however , they will also significantly increase the precision on the oscillation parameters @xmath7 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , reducing their uncertainty to the sub - percent level .",
    "the @xmath4 viable models identified in ref .",
    "@xcite make @xmath28 distinct solar predictions , which are shown in table  [ tab : solar_pred ] .",
    "such precision will have a significant impact on the viability of the correlations predicted by flavour symmetric models . to understand the impact of these high precision measurements , we have performed a simulation based on the juno design to determine its ability to test the correlations shown in table  [ tab : solar_pred ] . in our simulation",
    ", we assume a @xmath29  kton liquid scintillator detector with a linear energy uncertainty of @xmath30 .",
    "the juno facility will detect neutrinos from @xmath31 nearby reactors ; however , we model this by a single source at a baseline distance given by the power weighted average of @xmath32  km and a reactor power of @xmath33  gw @xcite .",
    "we have normalised our spectrum to produce @xmath34 events , including a @xmath35 normalisation uncertainty . in fig .",
    "[ fig : juno_sr ] , we show the allowed regions at @xmath36 significance for the models shown in table  [ tab : solar_pred ] . we see that only two of the @xmath36 intervals overlap , which allows for a strong model discrimination .",
    "the ability for juno to exclude these models independently of their atmospheric sum rules provides a great complementarity between the reactor and long - baseline programmes .",
    "furthermore , the two indistinguishable models for juno predict very different atmospheric sum rules , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the golden ratio , and we expect these to be distinguishable with a superbeam for most of the parameter space @xcite .    the @xmath36 allowed regions for the solar predictions shown in table  [ tab : solar_pred ] after @xmath28 years of data taking by juno.,width=359 ]",
    "the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments , with their focus on precision measurements of the underlying parameters , will allow certain classes of models with discrete flavour symmetries to be thoroughly tested . in ref .",

    ", we have highlighted the potential for experimental exclusion of these models at a circa @xmath1  km reactor experiment based on the juno facility . by testing the solar predictions to high accuracy",
    ", such a facility will be able to independently distinguish between almost all models under consideration .",
