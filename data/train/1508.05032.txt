    "the main application area of fission chambers is the measurement of the neutron flux in operating ( critical ) reactors @xcite .",
    "fission chambers offer several advantages : they are robust ; can be operated in both pulse and current mode and they endure high temperatures .",
    "one special advantage of fission chambers is their capability of suppressing unwanted minority components in the detector current , such as gamma events , with a proper signal processing technique .",
    "this is based on the so - called campbell theorem , which establishes relationships between the various order moments of the signal @xcite , hence make it possible to determine the mean detection rate from the second moment of the detector current @xcite .",
    "however , using fission chambers in campbelling mode in measurements in a reactor has been controversial right from the beginning .",
    "namely , the campbell theorems are only valid in the case when the detection events are independent and the detection intervals obey an exponential distribution . in the case of a multiplying system , either critical or subcritical , the detections will not be independent , due to the branching character of the neutron multiplication process .",
    "in fact , it is the deviation of the detection times from the exponential distribution , or the deviation of the number of detections from a poisson distribution , which is utilised in the reactivity measurement techniques based on pulse counting , i.e. the feynman- and rossi - alpha techniques @xcite .    even if it is surmised that application of the campbell theorem might be allowable even for detections of time - correlated neutrons , by correcting for the ( presumably small ) quantitative error by a calibration procedure",
    ", it is of fundamental importance to understand the qualitative and quantitative effect of the existence of the correlations between the detection events on the variance of the signal .",
    "this would quantify the bias of the application of the traditional campbell relationships to extract the mean detection intensity from the variance of the detector currents , and eventually even make it possible to extract information about the system , such as the subcritical reactivity , the same way as it is done by the pulse counting techniques .",
    "a first step to achieve these goals was made recently by the present authors by setting up a formalism which unites the stochastic description of the branching process with that of the statistical theory of the detector signal @xcite . in that work ,",
    "delayed neutrons were not accounted for . in the present work",
    "we extend the formalism to include also delayed neutrons .",
    "naturally , the formalism becomes more involved , and both the derivations and the results become less transparent .",
    "hence , out of the two goals of the previous work ( calculating the bias of the traditional campbell theorem , and calculating the auto - covariance of the detector signal in order to determine the subcritical reactivity similarly as in a rossi - alpha measurement ) , only the first will be aimed at in this paper ; the second would lead to prohibitively complicated expressions .",
    "one benefit of the more complicated calculations is that quantitative results can be presented about the bias of the traditional campelling method in terms of the subcritical reactivity of the system , with direct relevance to operating reactors .",
    "the results show that the bias of the traditional campbelling technique is a monotonic function of the subcritical reactivity .",
    "it increases when approaching criticality and diverges in a critical reactor . on the other hand , in deep subcritical systems",
    ", the bias of the traditional campbelling method vanishes , and the traditional formula becomes exact in the limit of a purely absorbing system where no branching takes place and hence the individual detection events are independent .",
    "the formalism used in this work was elaborated in two previous publications .",
    "the statistical theory of the fission detector signal due to independent detection events , based on the backward master equation approach , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "then the theory was extended to the case of detecting neutrons in a subcritical medium driven with an extraneous neutron source with poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "all fission neutrons were considered as prompt in this latter work .",
    "although we stall try to make this paper self - contained as much as possible , reference will be made to the above publications for the details whenever it is practical .",
    "as in the previous works , a basic quantity used will be the probability @xmath0 that at a time instant @xmath1 the value of a single detector pulse @xmath2 , initiated by the detection of a neutron at time @xmath3 , is in the interval @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the current pulse generated by a neutron arriving to the detector can be considered as a response function of the detector . in many cases ,",
    "this response function can not be given by a deterministic function @xmath5 ; rather , it should be described by a function @xmath6 which depends on a properly selected random variable @xmath7 .",
    "hence the function @xmath6 represents the current signal which exists in the detector at time @xmath1 after the arrival of one neutron at @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that this signal depends also on a random variable @xmath7 , which is defined by its distribution function @xmath8 @xmath9 thus one can write that @xmath10\\,w(x)\\;dx , \\qquad \\qquad y \\geq 0.\\ ] ] the continuously arriving neutrons generate the detector current as the aggregate of such current signals , each related to different realizations of @xmath7 .    in further calculations",
    "the characteristic function @xmath11 will be often used , which is obtained from the above as @xmath12\\,w(x)\\;dx \\right)\\;dy = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\,e^{\\imath \\omega \\varphi(x , t)}\\,w(x)\\;dx.\\ ] ] the moments of @xmath2 are given by the formulae : @xmath13_{\\omega=0 } = \\left(\\frac{\\displaystyle 1}{\\displaystyle \\imath}\\right)^{k } \\ ,",
    "\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\ , \\left[\\varphi(x , t)\\right]^{k}\\,w(x)\\;dx,\\ ] ] @xmath14 for any given signal shape @xmath15 and amplitude distribution @xmath8 , these moments can be calculated .    the main objective of the present work is to determine the stochastic properties of the detector signal for detections in a multiplying system driven by a poisson - like neutron source with constant intensity , where the individual detection events are not independent .",
    "in the previous work @xcite it was already shown that the campbell theorem becomes invalid when the detected neutrons lose their independence . in the present work , the theory will be extended for the case when the effect of the delayed neutrons in the neutron multiplication process is taken into account .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , only one type of precursors will be considered in the calculations .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the probability that in a subcritical system which is driven by a poisson - like neutron source with constant intensity @xmath17 , at the time moment @xmath1 , the detector current @xmath18 is found in the interval @xmath19 $ ] , provided that at the time instant @xmath20 the detector current and the numbers of neutrons and precursors were zero .",
    "for further calculations one needs the characteristic function @xmath21 which will play the role of the generating function .",
    "adding up for the mutually exclusive events that there will be or will not be a first collision between @xmath22 $ ] and applying the convolution theorem for the latter case , one obtains the following backward equation for @xmath23 : @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the probability that in a subcritical system without a source , at the time instant @xmath1 , the detector current @xmath18 lies within the interval @xmath19 $ ] , provided that at time @xmath20 the detector current and the number of precursors were zero , while the number of the neutrons was equal to @xmath27 .",
    "one can call @xmath28 the single - particle induced distribution , whereas @xmath29 is the source - induced distribution .    introducing the characteristic function @xmath30 and the convolution theorem , from equation ( [ 9 ] ) one obtains the following equation : @xmath31    it is easy to show that the solution of the integral equation ( [ 10 ] ) is given by @xmath32\\;dt'\\right\\}.\\ ] ] it",
    "can be seen that the density function @xmath33 , or its characteristic function @xmath34 , plays a fundamental role in the description of random behaviour of the detector current .",
    "it remains to derive an equation for @xmath35 , and it is at this point that our description will deviate from the previous work .",
    "first of all , since both the detector signal , as well as the number distribution of the neutrons , will be the result of a branching process , one can only derive a backward master equation if one also keeps track of the time evolution of the number of neutrons .",
    "in addition , we need to take into account that the branching will generate not only neutrons but also delayed neutron precursors , as well as that a singe delayed neutron precursor too , can initiate a branching process and a corresponding detector signal evolution .    hence ,",
    "in deriving the corresponding master equations , we need to consider the extended densities @xmath36 and @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the probability that in a ( source - free ) subcritical system at the time instant @xmath1 , the detector current @xmath18 will lie within the interval @xmath19 $ ] , while the number of neutrons @xmath39 and that of precursors @xmath40 are equal to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , provided that at the time instant @xmath20 the detector current and the number of precursors was zero , and the number of the neutrons was equal to @xmath27 .",
    "likewise , @xmath43 is the same probability , except that at time @xmath3 the number of neutrons was equal to zero , and the number of precursors was @xmath27 .",
    "once these quantities are determined , the density @xmath44 appearing in ( [ 9 ] ) is obtained as @xmath45 and similarly for @xmath46 .",
    "the derivation of the backward equation for @xmath47 goes as follows .",
    "if at @xmath20 one single neutron exists in the system , then in the time interval @xmath48 $ ] four mutually exclusive events can take place :    * the neutron will not have any reaction ; * the neutron gets detected in the detector with an intensity @xmath49 and creates a current pulse ; * the neutron is captured in the subcritical medium with intensity @xmath50 , * the neutron creates a fission in the subcritical medium with intensity @xmath51 .",
    "it is clear that the total intensity of a reaction in the system is @xmath52 .",
    "similarly to previous work , the fact that the detection itself is a fission event , which also will produce further neutrons , will be neglected .    in a fission reaction , @xmath53 neutrons and @xmath54 precursors of the same type are produced with probability @xmath55 .",
    "it is assumed that the number of neutrons and that of precursors are independent , i.e. @xmath56 for later use , introduce the generating functions @xmath57 by applying the backward approach , one can write @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 \\ , \\delta(y_{1 } ) \\,\\delta_{n_{1},0}\\,\\delta_{c_{1},0 } + \\ ] ] @xmath63 and @xmath64 \\ , \\delta(y_{2 } ) \\,\\delta_{n_{2},0}\\,\\delta_{c_{2},0 } + \\ ] ] @xmath65 in a similar manner , taking into account the two mutually exclusive events that the delayed neutron precursor will not decay or will decay with intensity @xmath66 , the following equation can be derived for the case when the branching process is started by one precursor : @xmath67 which connects the density function @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "defining the generating functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 from ( [ 15 ] ) one obtains the equations for the generating functions in the following form : @xmath72 @xmath73 \\",
    ", q^{(d)}\\left[g_{x}(\\omega , z_{1 } , z_{2 } , t ' \\ , \\vert \\boldsymbol{c}(0 ) = 1)\\right],\\ ] ] while the generating function of equation ( [ 18 ] ) is given by @xmath74 at this point it is possible to revert to the case when only the stochastic behaviour of the detector current is of interest only , irrespective of the number of the neutrons or precursors in the system .",
    "the dynamics of the branching is compressed into the non - linear functions @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "hence in the continuation we will simplify eqs ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) by substituting @xmath77 and by turning to the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 as is seen from ( [ 12 ] ) it is the @xmath80 of ( [ 21a ] ) which is needed for the calculation of @xmath81 , from which the moments of the stationary detector current in a subcritical system driven by an external neutron noise can be determined .    from equations ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) , applying the notations defined in ( [ 21a ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) , one obtains @xmath82 @xmath83 \\ , q^{(d)}\\left[g(\\omega , t ' \\ , \\vert \\boldsymbol{c}(0 ) = 1)\\right],\\ ] ] and @xmath84    for the determination of the cumulants of the detector current we will use the well - known relation @xmath85_{\\omega=0},\\ ] ] where @xmath86\\;dt'.\\ ] ]",

    "hence , fission chambers can be used without problems to measure the stationary flux in subcritical systems , as long as the detector was properly calibrated in measurements , to obtain the correct proportionality factor .    the apparent problem that the bias factor diverges for critical systems ,",
    "does not constitute a problem in practice either . in reality",
    ", one determines an estimate of the exact value of the calibration factor , whose definition is based on an ensemble average , from a time average , which is taken over a finite time interval , hence it remains finite .",
    "this is very much in line with the way how the auto power spectral densities of time - resolved measurement signals are determined from the fourier transforms of the signal ( as opposed to that of its auto - correlation function ) by the help of the wiener - khinchin theorem , which also involves the appearance of a scaling factor which is infinite , but whose estimate remains a finite quantity .",
    "interesting insight can be gained by taking the opposite case of deeply subcritical systems with @xmath194 .",
    "[ fig10 ] indicates that in that case the bias factor tends to a constant .",
    "a simple analysis of eq . ( [ 76 ] ) shows that , since @xmath195 one has @xmath196 this is a completely logical result , which expresses the fact that in a deeply subcritical system the effect of branching diminishes .",
    "hence , in the limit , the individual detection events will become independent , and the traditional formula and the one accounting for the correlations , give exactly the same result .",
    "this shows a nice and reassuring link between the traditional campbelling theory and the more involved case where the non - independent character of the incoming primary events is accounted for .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same agreement between the traditional and the extended theory is found in our previous paper @xcite , i.e. that the bias factor converges to unity when @xmath197 .",
    "this can be obtained analytically from eq .",
    "( 60 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , which readily yields @xmath198 however this fact was failed to be mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the previously introduced formalism for the calculation of the statistics of the signal of a fission chamber , detecting neutrons in a multiplying medium and hence experiencing non - independent detection events , was extended by accounting for delayed neutrons .",
    "the variance of the detector signal was derived and explicitly calculated with the assumption of a plausible detector response function . a comparison with the variance of the traditional formula , given by the campbell theorem , made it possible to quantify the dependence of the bias on the subcriticality of the multiplying system .",
    "as expected , the deviation between the two cases vanishes in the case of deep subcriticalities , since in a non - multiplying medium only the source neutrons will be detected , which are emitted independently from each other . when approaching criticality , the effect of the multiplication and hence that of the non - independent character of the detections will increasingly dominate , thus the bias of the traditional campbelling technique will increase . in practice ,",
    "as long as the fission chamber is calibrated from measurements , this does not pose a problem .",
    "although , according to the results , the calibration factor depends on the system subcriticality , our results show that the bias factor is quantitatively quite close to unity for the regimes in which the planned subcritical accelerator driven systems are planned to be operated , hence fission chambers can be used for flux monitoring . for the case of measurements in a critical system , which is the most important mode of operation of a fission chamber , the divergence of the bias , and hence that of the corresponding calibration factor is handled by estimating the variance of the detector signal from a measurement of finite time duration",
    "the factor @xmath179 in the stationary variance of the detector current ( [ 72 ] ) is given by the following formula : @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202 @xmath203 + \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath204 @xmath205\\,\\alpha_{e }   + \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath206\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are defined by ( [ 40 ] ) and ( [ 41 ] ) , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the formula depends , among others , on the detector characteristics ( the pulse shape and the corresponding decay constant @xmath120 of the detector ) , hence it can not be considered as universal .",
    "however , the qualitative monotonic behaviour , as well as the asymptotic properties for the cases @xmath207 and @xmath208 are universal , and do not depend on the detector properties .",
    "it is only the speed of the convergence which is dependent on the detector characteristics .",
