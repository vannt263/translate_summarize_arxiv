    "in accordance with our current understanding of astronomical observations , usual matter constitutes only @xmath11% of the universe ; the main components are dark matter ( @xmath12% ) and dark energy ( @xmath13% ) @xcite .",
    "various extensions of the standard model propose many candidates on the role of dark matter ( dm ) particles @xcite which are neutral and only weakly interact with matter ( weakly interacting massive particles , wimps ) .",
    "one of the approaches to discover these particles is to detect scattering of wimps on atomic nuclei in sensitive detectors placed deep underground and measured in extra low background conditions @xcite .",
    "taking into account likely mass range and velocities of wimps , energies of nuclear recoils are expected below @xmath14 kev with character interaction rates of @xmath15 events kg@xmath16 d@xmath16 .",
    "many searches of wimps with semiconductor , scintillator and bolometer detectors to - date gave only negative results ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; instead positive evidence for dm particles ( wimps are a subclass ; other candidates and other kinds of interactions are also available ) in the galactic halo has been pointed out by dama experiments by exploiting the dm annual modulation signature with nai(tl ) scintillators during more than 10 years long measurements @xcite .    for a long time",
    "it is known that amount of light produced in scintillating material by highly ionizing particles is lower than that produced by electrons of the same energy @xcite .",
    "thus , in a scintillator calibrated with electron and/or @xmath17 sources ( which is an usual practice ) , signals from ions will be seen at lower energies ( sometimes up to @xmath18 times ) than their real values .",
    "evidently knowledge of these transformation coefficients  quenching factors  is extremely important in searches for wimps and in predictions where the wimps signal should be expected .",
    "many experimental efforts were devoted to measurements , sometimes very sophisticated , of quenching factors at low energies in different detectors ( see e.g. recent works @xcite and further references ) .",
    "quenching factors are also needed in measurements and interpretation of signals from @xmath1 particles in scintillators .",
    "as examples , we can mention here recent experiments on searches ( and first observations ) of extremely rare @xmath1 decays ( @xmath19 yr ) : @xmath20w in cdwo@xmath7 @xcite and cawo@xmath7 @xcite crystal scintillators , and @xmath21eu in caf@xmath9(eu ) @xcite .",
    "while few approaches in calculation of quenching factors are known @xcite , satisfactory theory able to exactly predict ( and very often even to describe already measured ) quenching factors for all detectors and particles still is absent .",
    "for example , in the lindhard s approach @xcite it is possible to calculate quenching of ions with atomic number @xmath22 in scintillator only with the same @xmath22 number ; in addition , this theory predicts decrease of quenching factors at low energies , very often in contradiction with experimental data .",
    "hitachi s model @xcite gives better description and for wider data range , however it is not easy to reproduce these calculations independently .    below we describe rather simple method of calculation of quenching factors for different ions ( from protons to heavy recoils ) , based on semi - empirical approach of birks @xcite and using available in internet software for calculation of stopping powers for electrons and ions ( estar @xcite and srim @xcite codes , respectively ) .",
    "it employs only one parameter ( @xmath0 birks factor ) which could be found by fitting experimental data measured for particles of one kind in some energy region ( e.g. for @xmath1 particles from external sources or internal contamination of a detector by u / th chains , @xmath23sm , @xmath24pt , etc . ) but afterwards can be used to calculate quenching factors for other particles and in other energy regions ( e.g. for nuclear recoils at low energies ) .",
    "summary of the method is given in section 2 .",
    "calculations with this method are demonstrated in section 3 for number of scintillators : organic scintillators ( solid c@xmath2h@xmath2 , and liquid c@xmath3h@xmath4 , c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) ; crystal scintillators ( pure cdwo@xmath7 , pbwo@xmath7 , znwo@xmath7 , cawo@xmath7 , cef@xmath8 , and doped caf@xmath9(eu ) , csi(tl ) , csi(na ) , nai(tl ) ) ; liquid noble gases ( lxe ) .",
    "estimations of quenching factors for nuclear recoils are also given for some scintillators where experimental data are absent ( cdwo@xmath7 , pbwo@xmath7 , cef@xmath8 , bi@xmath7ge@xmath8o@xmath6 , lif , znse ) . section 4 gives conclusions .",
    "in calculation of quenching factors , we follow birks approach in description of quenching of the light yield for highly ionizing particles @xcite",
    ". light yield of scintillating material depends not only on energy of particle @xmath25 but also on how big is its stopping power @xmath26 in the material .",
    "1 gives example of stopping powers for electrons ( calculated with the estar software @xcite ) , and for protons , alpha particles , o , ca and w ions ( calculated with the srim code @xcite ) in the cawo@xmath7 material .       in case when created in a scintillator excitation centers are spaced at large distances and interactions between them can be neglected , what is realized for particles with low stopping power ( fast electrons , energies above @xmath27 kev ) , scintillation yield @xmath28 is proportional to released energy @xmath29 : @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the absolute scintillation factor ) , or in differential form    @xmath32    to account for suppression of the light yield for highly ionizing particles ( protons , @xmath1 particles and nuclear recoils ; hereafter all of them will be named `` ions '' ) , birks proposed semi - empirical formula @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is density of excitation centers along the track , and @xmath35 is a quenching factor ; @xmath0 is usually treated as a single parameter ( birks factor )",
    ".    equation ( 2 ) gives the following approximations for light yields for particles with low ( fast electrons ) and high ( ions ) stopping power :    @xmath36    but in general light yield is :    @xmath37    quenching factor for ions particles is often named `` @xmath10 '' ratio . ] is a ratio of light yield of ions to that of electrons of the same energy :    @xmath38    the @xmath31 factor disappeared in the ratio factor is supposed independent on energy and equal for electrons and ions ; in the following we will suppose that the @xmath0 factor is also independent on energy .",
    "] , and @xmath39 depends only on single parameter @xmath0 .    instead of quenching factor ,",
    "sometimes a relative light yield , ratio of @xmath40 to energy @xmath25 , normalized to that for electron @xmath41 at some energy @xmath42 , is used :    @xmath43    relation between @xmath39 and @xmath44 is evident :    @xmath45    thus , @xmath44 is close to @xmath39 if @xmath25 and @xmath42 are in energy region where electron light yield @xmath41 is proportional to energy .",
    "taking into account that approximately ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we can obtain the following approximation for quenching factor :    @xmath48    while this expression , see eq .",
    "( 6.5 ) . ]",
    "is approximate , it gives the following important features of quenching factor :    \\(1 ) quenching factor depends on energy .",
    "this is not so trivial feature because in many papers on @xmath49 measurements it was supposed that @xmath49 is constant ;    \\(2 ) @xmath49 is minimal when @xmath50 is maximal ;    \\(3 ) @xmath49 increases at low energies ; this is a consequence of decrease of @xmath50 , see fig . 1 .    in the following , we will use eq .",
    "( 5 ) to calculate quenching factors for different particles and different scintillators . stopping powers for ions will be calculated with the srim code @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that it is possible to calculate stopping powers for @xmath1 particles and protons also with the astar and pstar codes of the star package @xcite , respectively , but list of materials available is restricted .",
    "there is also difference in @xmath26 calculated with the srim and astar & pstar for @xmath1 particles and protons which results also in difference in calculated quenching factors ; some examples are given later .",
    "the srim code does not allow to calculate stopping powers for electrons , and for this the estar code @xcite will be used .",
    "contrary to other approaches , we will use _ total _ stopping powers instead of using only electronic part of @xmath26 .",
    "currently we accept this as a hypothesis and will show in future that it works well ( in particular , see fig . 9 later ) .",
    "before to calculate quenching factors and compare them with experimental values measured in different works , the following general note should be made .",
    "quenching factors could depend on many conditions of experimental measurements :    \\(1 ) if scintillator is not pure but doped with some material which enhances its scintillating characteristics ( e.g. tl in nai(tl ) or csi(tl ) ) , @xmath49 depends on kind and amount of dopant .",
    "for example , for pbwo@xmath7 detectors and external @xmath1 particles of 5.25 mev @xmath49 were measured as @xmath51 with different dopants and their different amounts @xcite . and even if some material is considered as a `` pure '' scintillator , usually it also contains impurities and defects which could affect @xmath49 .",
    "\\(2 ) scintillation dynamics and light output depend on temperature .",
    "this is also well known experimental fact ; f.e .",
    "we can quote ref .",
    "@xcite where average decay time of camoo@xmath7 scintillator was measured as @xmath52 @xmath53s at @xmath54 c but as @xmath55 @xmath53s at @xmath56 c. usually scintillation has few components with amplitudes different for different particles .",
    "temperature dependence of these amplitudes could lead to change in quenching factors ; for example , for @xmath1 particle with @xmath57 mev emitted in @xmath1 decay of @xmath58gd inside gd@xmath9sio@xmath59(ce ) detector , the @xmath10 ratio changed from 0.168 at @xmath60 c to 0.178 at @xmath54 c @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , change in temperature from @xmath54 c to @xmath60 c resulted in increase of the @xmath10 ratio on 7% in nai(tl ) , 35% in csi(tl ) and 25% in csi(na ) ; change from @xmath54 c to @xmath61 c decreased @xmath10 ratio on 3% , 15% and 30% in these crystals , respectively .",
    "\\(3 ) such a technical parameter as time @xmath62 during which scintillation signal is collected by a data acquisition system , is in fact very important and could drastically change @xmath49 values .",
    "this is because the amplitudes of different components of scintillation signal are different for different particles ; thus different parts of a signal will be collected during @xmath62 .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "2 where relative light output for csi(tl ) and external @xmath1 particles with energies between @xmath63 and 10 mev were measured with @xmath64 @xmath53s and 7 @xmath53s @xcite .",
    "attempts to fit these data also are shown .",
    "descriptions of the data with eq .",
    "( 6 ) ( which is better for @xmath65 @xmath53s ) lead to different values of the @xmath0 parameter : @xmath66 g mev@xmath16 @xmath67 for @xmath64 @xmath53s , and @xmath68 g mev@xmath16 @xmath67 for @xmath65 @xmath53s .",
    "this gives very important conclusion : the birks factor @xmath0 , which very often is named `` birks constant '' , in fact _ is not a fundamental constant _ for a given material but could have different values at different experimental conditions ( including time of a signal collection @xmath62 ) .",
    "if signals are not collected during a proper time , it is possible to obtain wrong conclusions on @xmath49 values .",
    "for example , the light output for protons of 662 kev in csi(tl ) measured during @xmath64 @xmath53s in @xcite is higher than that for @xmath17 quanta of the same energy because scintillation signal for @xmath69 is faster .",
    "thus , instead of expected quenching ( @xmath70 ) we , on contrary , obtain enhancement ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "however , with @xmath17 and @xmath69 signals collected during longer time of 7 @xmath53s , we have the usual situation when @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "\\(4 ) sometimes quenching factors are derived from measurements with non - monoenergetic neutron sources like am - be mev ( @xmath72 mev ) @xcite . ] . after collision with neutron , nuclear recoil with mass @xmath73 has energy determined by initial energy of neutron @xmath74 and neutron scattering angle @xmath75 :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the neutron mass , and the last approximation is valid for heavy nuclei ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "energy dependence of quenching factor can be found only if the initial neutron energy and scattering angle are known ; measurements with non - monoenergetic neutron sources give only some average @xmath49 value which , nevertheless , could be useful estimate of @xmath49 for energy range @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is mass number of nuclear recoil , if more detailed data are absent ( this effective energy range is also related with dependence of the cross section on angle of scattering ) .",
    "\\(5 ) presence of electric field in case of liquid noble gases could distort initial @xmath49 values ( obtained without electric field ) .",
    "other phenomena like channeling effect in crystals ( see f.e .",
    "@xcite ) , dependence of @xmath49 on direction of particle s movement relatively to crystal axes ( as f.e . in cdwo@xmath7",
    "@xcite ) or diffusion and movement of molecules in liquids @xcite also effect quenching factors .    in accordance with the above mentioned",
    ", we will not expect that the birks factor @xmath0 for a given material will have the same value in different measurements .",
    "however , we will expect that if conditions of measurements and data treatment are fixed , @xmath0 will be the same for all particles .",
    "such a hypothesis was discussed already in @xcite , and it was supported by some experimental data . below we show that it gives reliable results for a range of energies of interest here ( low energy ions and @xmath1 particles with energies up to @xmath82 mev ) .",

    "<S> semi - empirical method of calculation of quenching factors for scintillators is described . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on classical birks formula with the total stopping powers for electrons and ions which are calculated with the estar and srim codes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> method has only one fitting parameter ( the birks factor @xmath0 ) which can have different values for the same material in different conditions of measurements and data treatment . </S>",
    "<S> a hypothesis is used that , once the @xmath0 value is obtained by fitting data for particles of one kind and in some energy region ( e.g. for a few mev @xmath1 particles from internal contamination of a detector ) , it can be applied to calculate quenching factors for particles of another kind and for another energies ( e.g. for low energy nuclear recoils ) if all data are measured in the same experimental conditions and are treated in the same way . </S>",
    "<S> applicability of the method is demonstrated on many examples including materials with different mechanisms of scintillation : organic scintillators ( solid c@xmath2h@xmath2 , and liquid c@xmath3h@xmath4 , c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) ; crystal scintillators ( pure cdwo@xmath7 , pbwo@xmath7 , znwo@xmath7 , cawo@xmath7 , cef@xmath8 , and doped caf@xmath9(eu ) , csi(tl ) , csi(na ) , nai(tl ) ) ; liquid noble gases ( lxe ) . </S>",
    "<S> estimations of quenching factors for nuclear recoils are also given for some scintillators where experimental data are absent ( cdwo@xmath7 , pbwo@xmath7 , cef@xmath8 , bi@xmath7ge@xmath8o@xmath6 , lif , znse ) .    </S>",
