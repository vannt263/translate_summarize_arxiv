    "we want now to find the states @xmath41 for which the above three inequalities are equalities .",
    "inequality ( b ) is an equality only if @xmath126 is a pure state and it is an eigenstate of either @xmath6 or @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "to finish the proof for @xmath109 and @xmath111 , we have to prove the converses : if the state is maximally entangled , then there exist two complementary bases such that @xmath30 or @xmath162 .",
    "any maximally entangled state @xmath217 is local - unitarily equivalent to @xmath218 .",
    "namely , @xmath219 with @xmath220 and @xmath221 unitaries ( which transform local bases one into another ) .",
    "the same result as for @xmath222 can then be achieved by starting from @xmath223 and considering as complementary bases the ones that are obtained by applying @xmath224 to the computational and the fourier bases .",
    "finally , to prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the pearson coefficient @xmath110 , we note that we have just shown that a state has maximal correlation for two complementary bases if and only if it is local - unitarily equivalent to @xmath222 .",
    "namely , in two complementary bases , the local outcomes match : @xmath225 .",
    "it is known that the pearson coefficient takes its extremal values @xmath56 iff the two stochastic variables are linearly dependent and perfectly correlated ( i.e.  in one - to - one correspondence ) .      here",
    "we prove that cc states can have maximal correlations only on one of two complementary variables and that cq states can not have maximal correlations on any variable .",
    "the first statement is formalized above as : if @xmath88 then we must have @xmath226 , where @xmath90 are the results of the measurements of @xmath91 .",
    "the second statement is formalized as : even if @xmath89 we still can not obtain @xmath227 .    we can prove both statements at the same time by observing that cc and cq states can be written in the form @xmath228 which can have maximal correlation on some property only for cc states ( where the @xmath229 are orthogonal for different @xmath230 ) .",
    "we can then show that the state @xmath231 which has some correlation on @xmath230 can not have any correlation on @xmath232 when @xmath232 is a complementary property , namely if @xmath233 .",

    "it is clear from the form of the state in that such a state does not have any correlations in @xmath232 : namely that a measurement of @xmath13 on the first system gives no information on the second .",
    "following a suggestion by an anonymous referee , we prove here that the sufficient condition @xmath235 for entanglement of pairs of qubits can be made stronger by adding a third mub for each qubit , which we name @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "actually , for a separable two - qubit state the argument given in the first supplemental section until eq .",
    "( [ conccd ] ) can be applied also for the third pair of bases @xmath238 .",

    "in particular note that the pearson correlations are now suitable to detect all werner states since they signature the presence of entanglement for @xmath245 .        in this section",
    "we study the effectiveness of our entanglement criterion based on complementary correlations to detect entanglement and compare it to known entanglement detection schemes .",
    "we stress that our proposal is not aimed at introducing a new entanglement detection scheme but it is aimed at giving a new interpretation of entanglement in terms of correlations for complementary properties .",
    "nonetheless , interestingly we see that these perform better than entanglement witnesses that employ the same measurements .",
    "moreover , entanglement detection based on correlations for complementary properties allows to detect many entangled states that entanglement witnesses miss .    in the following we",
    "provide a comparison between our method and an entanglement detection scheme based on the use of witness operators @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we compare the case of two qubit states , where entanglement witnesses that involve measurements of three complementary properties of qubits take a simple form , namely @xmath246 if tr@xmath247<0",
    "$ ] for at least one of @xmath248 for a two - qubit state @xmath41 , then the state is entangled .",
    "the first four operators are witness operators optimised for the bell states @xcite , while @xmath249 was added in order to include also the detection scheme based on the inequality @xmath250 for separable states @xcite .",
    "actually , testing for @xmath251 and @xmath249 allows to test the above condition .",
    "we performed a comparison between these detection schemes and our criterion ( extended to all three complementary bases of qubits as shown in the previous section ) with a monte carlo simulation , by considering @xmath252 random states obtained by generating @xmath253 random matrices according to the method detailed in @xcite . whether each state is entangled or not can be evaluated with the ppt criterion @xcite , which is a necessary and sufficient condition in this case",
    ": we found that @xmath254 of the states are entangled , which is consistent with known results @xcite .",
    "the pearson coefficient conjecture detects @xmath255 of these entangled states , whereas the entanglement witnesses detect @xmath256 of them .",
    "therefore , the pearson coefficient turns out to be more powerful for entanglement detection .    in fig .",
    "[ f : venn]a and the first panel of table [ ta : pearson ] we compare the performance of these witnesses against the pearson correlation conjecture .",
    "note that @xmath257 of the detected entangled states are not detected by the entanglement witnesses and are seen only by the pearson coefficient conjecture ( this corresponds to a fraction @xmath258 of the entangled stated detected using the pearson coefficient : these are detected only by the pearson correlations ) .",
    "the entanglement witnesses are less effective : they exclusively detect @xmath259 of the detected states ( this corresponds to a fraction @xmath260 of the states detected by the entanglement witnesses ) . in fig .",
    "[ f : venn]b and the second panel of table [ ta : pearson ] we compare also the performance of the sum of conditional probabilities conjecture .",
    "the mutual information does not perform well for entanglement detection , but interestingly most of the ( few ) entangled states it detects are distinct from the ones detected by the witnesses , as seen from the third panel in table [ ta : pearson ] .",

    "the first two tables are graphically depicted in fig .  [",
    "f : venn ] .",
    "the percentages depicted refer to the fraction of the entangled states that were detected by at least one of the methods , which is a fraction of @xmath262 of the entangled states in all cases since the mutual information and the sum of conditional entropies detect very few new entangled states that are not detected by the other two schemes : on the order of @xmath263 ) .",
    "we sampled @xmath252 random @xmath253 states and interpreted them as two - qubit states . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now present a comparison between the pearson conjecture and a relation ( proposed by an anonymous referee ) based on local uncertainty relations ( lur ) @xcite for qubits .",
    "indeed the lur implies that all separable states have @xmath264 .",
    "this is obtained from the uncertainty relation @xmath265 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to saying that all separable states satisfy @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the reduced state over the first subsystem and @xmath268 over the second , and where @xmath269 .",
    "the comparison between this entanglement detection condition and the pearson conjecture is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : referee ] , whence it is evident that the pearson conjecture that uses three complementary observables identifies many more entangled states than , which can identify only very few states ( @xmath270 of the identified ones ) that are not seen by the pearson conjecture .",
    "if one , instead , limits the pearson conjecture to the same two complementary observables employed in as in , then the former procedure results stronger , as it identifies all the entangled states seen .          [ [ efficiency - of - complementary - correlations - as - entanglement - criterion ] ] efficiency of complementary correlations as entanglement criterion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we want to discuss here the efficiency of our proposal as an entanglement criterion .",
    "it is clear from our proof above that our criterion could be immediately strengthened by considering just the entropic uncertainty relations @xcite instead of considering the mutual information : in fact , inequality is clearly stronger than .",
    "a discussion on these grounds goes beyond our aims : we do not want to provide a strong entanglement criterion , but a different way to interpret entanglement .",
    "nonetheless , the question of how strong is our proposal as entanglement criterion is a relevant one and we will explore it in this section .",
    "let us first distinguish between entanglement detection and entanglement criteria .",
    "the first refers to a measurement procedure , whose aim is to determine whether a given state is entangled or not using measurements that are independent of the state .",
    "the second refers to a general characterization of entanglement : how well does some criterion ( in our case , the classical correlation among complementary observables ) characterize entanglement ?",
    "it turns out that our proposal is quite effective in characterizing entanglement . for low dimensions",
    ", we explore this numerically for mixed states . in fig .",
    "[ f : optim ] we explore numerically the use of the pearson coefficient conjecture as an entanglement criterion by using only two mubs and by optimizing the complementary observables for each entangled state . for qubits ,",
    "optimizing only over the second observable already yields an increase in the detected states : one goes from a fraction @xmath271 of detected entangled states up to @xmath272 .",
    "an optimization over both observables achieves a further increase up to a fraction @xmath273 of entangled states detected .",
    "note that the first number @xmath271 is lower than the one reported in the previous section , where we reported that the pearson correlation detects a much larger fraction of the entangled states , namely @xmath274 of the detected entangled states which are @xmath275 of the total states , namely @xmath276 of the total states are detected as entangled .",
    "the reason that we achieve only @xmath271 here is because we only considered two instead of the three complementary observables of a qubit : that optimization would lead to the increase @xmath277 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : optim2]a .    as mentioned above , in these simulations we have only considered two complementary observables ( @xmath278 and @xmath279 ) .",
    "further increases can be achieved if one optimizes over all three complementary observables of qubits : see fig .",
    "[ f : optim2 ] . as regards to the percentage given in fig .",
    "[ f : optim2]b , we have to note one should be able to further increase it by optimizing also over all three complementary observables , instead of only one .",
    "preliminary investigations in this direction are promising but numerically very demanding .",
    "it is difficult to provide an estimate of the statistical error since the fluctuations due to the monte carlo simulations are non gaussian in this case .",
    "finally , we mention that our method becomes almost an optimal criterion for large dimensions and pure states according to an argument pointed out by k. zyczkowski @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it is practically impossible to explore numerically this regime .",
    "zyczkowski s argument @xcite is based on the fact that for @xmath280 almost all pure entangled states are close to maximally entangled , since the average entanglement of randomly chosen @xmath10-dimensional pure states goes as @xmath281 @xcite . for large @xmath10 ,",
    "the term @xmath282 becomes irrelevant .",
    "since our criterion gives a necessary - and - sufficient condition for maximally entangled states , it will then asymptotically detect almost all pure entangled states for @xmath280 .",
    "this is only a heuristic argument , however : one must account for the fact that the convergence to maximal entanglement might be so slow that the above argument might only be meaningful in the limit @xmath280 . in this regime",
    "our proof ( valid for finite @xmath10 ) does not hold , and discontinuities might be present @xcite .",

    "<S> we provide an interpretation of entanglement based on classical correlations between measurement outcomes of complementary properties : states that have correlations beyond a certain threshold are entangled . </S>",
    "<S> the reverse is not true , however . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , surprisingly , all separable nonclassical states exhibit smaller correlations for complementary observables than some strictly classical states . </S>",
    "<S> we use mutual information as a measure of classical correlations , but we conjecture that the first result holds also for other measures ( e.g.  the pearson correlation coefficient or the sum of conditional probabilities ) .    two properties of a quantum state are called complementary if they are such that , if one knows the value of one property , all possible values of the other property are equiprobable . </S>",
    "<S> more rigorously , let @xmath0 represent the eigenstates corresponding to possible values of a nondegenerate property @xmath1 , and @xmath2 the eigenstates of a nondegenerate property @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 and @xmath5 arbitrary bijective functions ) . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath6 and @xmath7 are complementary properties if for all @xmath8 we have @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the hilbert space dimension . </S>",
    "<S> clearly complementary properties with this definition identify two mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we study what classical correlations in the measurements of these complementary properties tell us about the quantum correlations of the state of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> typically one discusses entanglement @xcite in terms of non - locality , bell inequality violations , monotones over locc , etc . </S>",
    "<S> for example , previous literature on entanglement focused on time - reversal ( for the ppt criterion @xcite ) , local uncertainty relations @xcite , entropic uncertainty relations @xcite , entanglement witnesses @xcite , concurrence @xcite , the cross - norm criterion @xcite and the covariance matrix criterion @xcite ( the latter encompassing many of the former ) . in contrast to these studies , we focus specifically on classical correlations for complementary properties . </S>",
    "<S> classical correlations are typically quantified in terms of the mutual information , which is the main quantity considered here . </S>",
    "<S> we will also discuss the case of alternative measures such as the pearson correlations and the sum of conditional probabilities . in @xcite related approaches using specific measures of correlations ( different from the ones used here ) </S>",
    "<S> were proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper follows . </S>",
    "<S> we start by describing the general scenario we employ for correlation evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> we then introduce different measures of correlations and state our results and our conjectures regarding entanglement and quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we provide some examples of applications . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the proofs of our results are reported in the supplemental material .    </S>",
    "<S> = .8    consider two systems of finite dimension @xmath10 ( ) and two observables @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : illust ] ) where @xmath6 and @xmath13 are complementary on the first system ( namely @xmath14 for all eigenstates of @xmath6 and @xmath13 ) and @xmath7 and @xmath15 on the second . </S>",
    "<S> for example , take the computational basis of the two systems as the eigenstates of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the fourier basis as the ones of @xmath13 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we can quantify the correlations between the results of measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath7 with some correlation measure @xmath16 and the correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath15 with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath18 below we will define and investigate three possibilities : the mutual information @xmath19 , the sum of conditional probabilities @xmath20 , and the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> a measure of the overall correlation of the initial state , which we name the `` complementary correlations '' , can then be given as the sum of the absolute value of the two measures @xmath22 or as the product @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is typically a weaker measure than the former , since an upper bound for the sum implies an upper bound for the product . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath24 implies @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we will mainly consider the sum of correlations for complementary observables @xmath22 as a way to evaluate the complementary correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we start considering the mutual information : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the shannon entropy of the probabilities of the measurement outcomes of the first system and @xmath28 is the conditional entropy of the outcomes of the first conditioned on the second . </S>",
    "<S> the complementary correlations are then @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relation of this quantity to the entanglement and the discord of the state of the system is illustrated by the following results : ( i )  the state of a bipartite composite quantum system is maximally entangled if and only if there exist two complementary measurement bases where @xmath30 ; ( ii )  if @xmath31 the state of the bipartite system is entangled ( see also @xcite ) ; ( iii )  the separable states that satisfy this inequality with equality ( i.e.  @xmath32 ) , are the classically - correlated ( cc ) zero - discord states of the form @xmath33 with @xmath0 and @xmath34 eigenstates of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( or the analogous state with a uniform convex combination of eigenstates of @xmath13 and @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> some examples of @xmath29 for various families of states are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : example]a , where we emphasize the threshold @xmath35 above which all states are entangled .    </S>",
    "<S> the first result follows from the fact that each term in the sum is upper bounded by @xmath35 by definition . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value for the sum is then @xmath36 and is achievable if and only if there is maximal correlation both between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and between @xmath13 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> simple properties of the conditional probabilities ( see supplemental material ) imply that this can happen for a suitable choice of observables if and only if the state is maximally entangled . </S>",
    "<S> the second result is a consequence of the concavity of the entropy and of maassen and uffink s entropic uncertainty relation @xcite ( see supplemental material for the details ) . </S>",
    "<S> it gives a sufficient condition for entanglement that can be used for entanglement detection . </S>",
    "<S> the third result is surprising : one might expect that the separable states at the boundary with the entangled region are highly quantum correlated , whereas we find that they only have classical correlations ( cc ) and no discord . </S>",
    "<S> this means that quantum correlated states without entanglement do not have higher correlations for complementary properties than cc states . </S>",
    "<S> this result is peculiar for the mutual information as a figure of merit , it is no longer true for the pearson correlation ( where a family of qq states sits on the border , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : example]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be proved by analyzing the conditions for equality of the concavity of the entropy and of maassen and uffink s inequality ( see supplemental material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1 .    the second measure of correlation we consider is the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath37 , defined as @xmath38 where , as before , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote observables relative to the two systems , @xmath39tr@xmath40 $ ] is the expectation value on the quantum state @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the variance of the observable @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the above quantity can not be applied to eigenstates of @xmath6 or @xmath7 . clearly , @xmath44 for uncorrelated ( product ) states . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the classical pearson correlation coefficient , the quantum one is , in general , complex if @xmath6 and @xmath7 do not commute , but as in the classical case , its modulus is upper - bounded by one : @xmath45\\>+\\<\\{a , b\\}\\>}2-\\<a\\>\\<b\\>|^2 = \\nonumber\\\\&&|\\tfrac12{\\<[a , b]\\>}|^2 +    \\sigma_a^2\\sigma_b^2 \\labell{pearsbou}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 denote the commutator and anticommutator respectively , and where the final inequality is the schrdinger uncertainty relation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now use @xmath48 as a measure of complementary correlations to recover some entanglement properties of the system state . </S>",
    "<S> the pearson coefficient gauges only the linear correlation of two stochastic variables , so it will not detect maximal correlation even for a maximally entangled state unless pairs of observables are linear in each others eigenvalues ( e.g.  it would fail if @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) . however , if one restricts to linear observables , one can prove that a state is maximally entangled if and only if there exist two complementary bases such that @xmath51 , e.g.  if one uses @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are two complementary bases . </S>",
    "<S> the proof follows from the properties of the conditional probabilities ( used to prove the analogous statement for the mutual information ) and from the fact that the pearson coefficient is @xmath56 if and only if there is a functional relation that connects the two stochastic variables ( details in supplemental material ) .    instead , for non maximally entangled states we have two conjectures which are supported by numerical evidence : ( i )  if @xmath57 , the two systems are entangled . </S>",
    "<S> as for the mutual information , the inequality is tight since @xmath58 is separable and has @xmath59 ; ( ii )  if @xmath60 , the two systems are entangled . also this inequality is tight : it is attained by the separable state @xmath61 , with @xmath2 eigenstates of @xmath13 . as argued above </S>",
    "<S> , the conjecture with the product is weaker than the one with the sum : proving that all separable states have @xmath62 implies @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof of these conjectures is complicated by the fact that the convexity properties of @xmath37 are unknown . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , they are natural conjectures that are easy to verify for large classes of states ( e.g.  see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> f : example]b ) . we have also performed extensive numerical checks by testing them on large sets of random states generated according to the prescription described in @xcite , and verifying that no state with non - positive partial transpose @xcite lies over the conjectured threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the pearson correlation only measures linear correlation , whereas the mutual information measures all types of correlations . </S>",
    "<S> so one could think that the latter is stronger and that these conjectures are implied by the mutual information results of the previous section . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , this is false since there exist probability distributions that have maximal pearson correlation but negligible mutual information @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , consider the family of entangled two - qubit states @xmath64 with @xmath65 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> if one uses @xmath66 and @xmath67 , for all @xmath68 such state has @xmath69 ( . ] ) , but @xmath70 clearly has negligible mutual information for @xmath71 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the pearson correlation identifies @xmath70 as entangled for all @xmath68 ( assuming the above conjectures ) , whereas the mutual information does not even identify it as classically correlated _ at all _ for @xmath71 . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , numerical simulations suggest that pearson correlation is more effective at detecting entanglement in random states than mutual information .    </S>",
    "<S> the third measure of correlation we consider is the sum of conditional probabilities @xmath72 , defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the probability of outcome @xmath75 on the first system conditioned on result @xmath76 on the second . </S>",
    "<S> [ this is a somewhat limited measure of correlations as the correspondence @xmath77 among results is clearly arbitrary </S>",
    "<S> . a more relevant measure of correlation should also maximize ( or minimize ) over the permutations of the measurement outcomes , but for the sake of simplicity we will avoid it . ] in @xcite a similar approach was used , but employing joint probabilities in place of conditional ones .    </S>",
    "<S> gauging complementary correlations with the sum @xmath78 we can again obtain information about entanglement and quantum correlations : ( i )  analogously to the case of the mutual information , the sum is optimized only for maximally entangled states : a state is maximally entangled if and only if there exist two complementary bases such that @xmath79 ; ( ii )  as for the pearson correlation , we have a conjecture for non - maximally entangled states : if @xmath80 has a value outside the interval @xmath81 $ ] , we conjecture that the two systems are entangled . as in the previous cases , </S>",
    "<S> the inequalities are tight since the upper bound is attained by the separable state @xmath58 and the lower bound by the separable state @xmath82 , with @xmath83 sum modulo @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us analyse the case of separable states . </S>",
    "<S> we remind the reader that classical - quantum ( cq ) and quantum - classical ( qc ) states have the form @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively , where @xmath86 is a set of orthogonal states for one subsystem and @xmath87 is not an orthogonal set of states . </S>",
    "<S> note that separable quantum - quantum ( qq ) states comprise all separable ones that are not cc , cq or qc .    </S>",
    "<S> for these states we can prove that : ( iii )  if cc states have maximal correlations on one of two complementary variables , they are uncorrelated on the other [ formally : if @xmath88 then we must have @xmath89 , where @xmath90 are the results of the measurements of @xmath91 with @xmath6 complementary to @xmath13 and @xmath7 to @xmath15 ] ; ( iv )  cq states can not have maximal correlations on any variable [ formally : we can not obtain @xmath93 , even when @xmath94 ; ( v )  qq states can have only _ partial _ correlation for each complementary property . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the separable two - qubit state @xmath95 has partial correlation on both complementary variables , since @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> given the properties ( iii ) and ( iv ) , one might suspect that separable states with non vanishing quantum correlations have always less complementary correlations , but this is not the case , as emphasized by ( v ) . summarizing </S>",
    "<S> , cc states can have maximal correlation only on one property , cq states can not have maximal correlation in any property , and qq states can have some correlation on multiple properties , but you need pure , maximally entangled states to get maximal correlations on more than one property .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding the result ( i ) , the proof is a direct consequence of simple properties of conditional probabilities ( see supplemental material ) as for the cases seen previously . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty in proving the conjecture ( ii ) stems again from a lack of definite concavity properties of @xmath97 , but as for the previous conjecture we have extensively tested it numerically on random states . </S>",
    "<S> one may ask whether the sum over all outcomes in the statement of the conjecture is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it is : the statement that all separable states satisfy @xmath98 for some @xmath99 is false ( where the two bounds @xmath100 and @xmath101 give the bounds @xmath102 and @xmath103 we used above when the sum over @xmath99 is performed ) . </S>",
    "<S> a counterexample is the separable state @xmath104 of two qubits for which @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> if one uses joint probabilities in place of conditional ones , a sufficient condition for entanglement can indeed be proven @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results ( iii ) and ( iv ) can be proved at the same time by using simple properties of cc and cq states when they are expressed in two complementary bases ( see supplemental material ) , whereas property ( v ) is a direct consequence of the example provided above .    up to now </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the correlations of the measurement outcomes of two complementary observables . </S>",
    "<S> all systems have at least three complementary observables @xcite , and it is known that there are @xmath103 for @xmath10-dimensional systems if @xmath10 is a power of a prime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be immediately extended to an arbitrary number of complementary observables by calculating the correlations of all the known complementary observables and considering the sum of the two largest ones . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for mutual information , we can extend the condition to conclude that the state is entangled if @xmath106 where max@xmath107 denotes the second largest term and where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath108 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> are all observables complementary to each other . </S>",
    "<S> the extensions of all other results and conjectures are analogous .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at least in the case of qubits the bound at point ( ii ) for the mutual information and the conjectured bound at point ( i ) for the pearson correlations can be made stronger by adding correlations for the third complementary observable . </S>",
    "<S> this can improve significantly the efficiency of the present method if used for entanglement detection . for details and for a comparison with other known entanglement detection schemes based on measurements of mubs </S>",
    "<S> see the supplemental material .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have introduced an interpretation of entanglement based on classical correlations of the measurement outcomes of complementary observables . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied different types of correlations ( mutual information @xmath109 , pearson coefficient @xmath110 , and sum of conditional probabilities @xmath111 ) for complementary observables of two systems . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how they provide information on the entanglement and quantum correlations of a bipartite system . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the following results and presented a few reasonable conjectures : ( i )  we proved necessary and sufficient conditions for maximal entanglement for @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , ( ii )  we proved sufficient conditions for entanglement based on @xmath109 and conjectured sufficient conditions based on @xmath110 and on @xmath111 ; ( iii )  when gauging complementary correlations using @xmath109 , we proved that the separable states on the boundary with the entangled - states region are strictly classically correlated , but the same result is false if one uses @xmath110 or @xmath111 ; moreover we have shown how @xmath111 provides insight on cc , cq , qc , and qq states , showing that ( iv )  without entanglement only classically correlated cc states can have maximal correlation on one variable ( but then they have no correlation on the complementary one ) , whereas ( v )  separable qq states can have only partial correlations on complementary variables </S>",
    "<S> .    one can ask if it is possible to give necessary and sufficient conditions based on correlations for complementary observables . the naive statement that entangled states _ always _ have larger correlations than separable states is false , since it is known that entangled states exist ( e.g.  @xmath70 defined above ) that are arbitrarily close to separable pure states @xcite and to the maximally mixed state ( in the sense that for any distance @xmath112 one can choose a sufficiently large dimension @xmath10 such that an entangled state is within distance @xmath112 from the maximally mixed state @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these have vanishing correlations for most measures of correlation . </S>",
    "<S> a notable exception , described above , is the pearson coefficient that is able to detect the entanglement of @xmath70 for all @xmath113 ( but it misses other types of entangled states ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we acknowledge useful feedback from b. kraus , k. zyczkowski , and an anonymous referee . </S>"
