    "moreover , polar codes are also proved to be optimal for lossy compression with respect to binary symmetric source @xcite@xcite , and then further extended to larger source alphabet @xcite .",
    "polar codes also contribute significantly to non - discrete input channels . by adopting polar codes as embedded codes at each expanded level , expansion coding scheme",
    "@xcite achieves the capacity of additive exponential noise channel in high snr region with low coding complexity . besides",
    ", a polar coding scheme achieving capacity for additive gaussian noise channel is investigated in @xcite , which utilizes the polarization result for multiple access channel @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the approach of using a multiple access channel with a large number of binary - input users has much better complexity attributes than the one of using a single - user channel with large input cardinality .    in this paper , we investigate the polar coding scheme for binary - input awgn channel @xcite@xcite in a fading scheme . by adopting bpsk modulation and demodulation technique , additive gaussian noise fading channel has been boiled down to a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) with finite set of transition probabilities according to the channel quality .",
    "the key intuition of the proposed scheme is based on observing the polarization characteristics of different bscs . by",
    "hierarchically using polar codes , where the transmitter encodes over blocks , it can be proved that the designed coding scheme achieves the capacity of converted channel ( fading bsc ) .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . after introducing the preliminary results on polar codes and problem background in section ii and iii , respectively , the polar coding scheme for fading channels",
    "is stated and illustrated in section iv .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion section .",
    "the construction of polar code is based on the observation of channel polarization .",
    "consider a binary - input discrete memoryless channel @xmath0 , where @xmath1 . define @xmath2.\\nonumber\\ ] ] let @xmath3 be the bit - reversal operator defined in @xcite , where @xmath4 . by applying the transform @xmath5 ( @xmath6 denotes the @xmath7 kronecker power of @xmath8 ) to @xmath9 ,",
    "consider transmitting the encoded output @xmath10 through @xmath11 independent copies of @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath11 new binary - input coordinate channels @xmath13 are constructed , where for each @xmath14 the transition probability is given by @xmath15 then as @xmath11 tends to infinity , the channels @xmath16 polarize to either noiseless or pure - noisy , and the fraction of noiseless channels is close to @xmath17 , the symmetric mutual information of channel @xmath12 @xcite .    to this end",
    ", polar codes can be considered as @xmath18-coset codes with parameter @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is frozen vector ( can be set to all - zero vector for symmetric channel @xcite ) , and the information set @xmath21 is chosen as a @xmath22-element subset of @xmath23 such that the bhattacharyya parameters satisfies @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the decoder in polar coding scheme is successive cancelation ( sc ) decoder , which gives an estimate @xmath27 of @xmath9 given knowledge of @xmath21 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 by computing @xmath30 in the order @xmath31 from @xmath32 to @xmath11 , where @xmath33 it has been proved that by adopting sc decoder , polar codes achieves any rate @xmath34 with decoding error scaling as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , the encoding and decoding complexity of polar codes are both @xmath37 .",
    "fading channels characterize the wireless communication channels , where the channel states are changing over times and only available at the decoders .",
    "fading coefficient typically varies much slower than transmission symbol duration in practice . to this end , a block fading model @xcite is proposed , whereby the state is assumed to be a constant over coherence time intervals and stationary ergodic across fading blocks .",
    "consider the awgn fading channel , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is i.i.d .",
    "additive gaussian noise with variance @xmath40 ; @xmath41 is channel input with power constraint @xmath42 @xmath43 is channel gain random variable ; @xmath11 is blocklength ; and @xmath44 is number of blocks . for this moment ,",
    "@xmath43 are assumed to be constant within a block and follow an i.i.d . fading process over blocks .",
    "in particular , for the two sates case @xmath45 we consider , omitting the indices , the distribution of @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "using bpsk modulation , any codeword produced by encoder is mapped to signal with element in @xmath49 . after utilizing a bpsk demodulation at the decoder ,",
    "the equivalent channel can be formulated as a binary symmetric channel , with transition probability relating to channel states .",
    "more specifically , the converted channel is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are both bernoulli random variables representing channel input and output correspondingly ; @xmath53 is i.i.d .",
    "channel noise , also distributed as bernoulli random variable , but related to channel state .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 and if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 where @xmath58 is cdf of normal distribution and @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the channel can be modeled as @xmath60bsc@xmath61 with probability @xmath62 , and as @xmath63bsc@xmath64 with probability @xmath65 .",
    "the ergodic capacity of the converted channel ( fading bsc ) is given by @xcite @xmath66+q_2[1-h(p_2)],\\label{fun : fading_capacity}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the binary entropy function , and si - d refers to channel state information at the decoder .",
    "the capacity achieving input distribution is uniform over @xmath68 . in this paper",
    ", we show a polar coding scheme achieving the capacity of converted fading channel with low encoding and decoding complexity , without having instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter ( only the statistical knowledge is assumed ) .",
    "in polar coding for a general b - dmc @xmath12 , we have seen the channel can be polarized by transforming a set of independent copies of given channels into a new set of channels whose symmetric capacities tend to 0 or 1 for all but a vanishing fraction of indices . to this end",
    ", an information set @xmath21 is constructed by picking the indices corresponding to @xmath22 minimum values of @xmath69 , which is equivalent to picking those corresponding to @xmath22 largest values of @xmath70 . in this sense ,",
    "the construction of @xmath21 is deterministic .",
    "however , as indicated in @xcite , the indices in @xmath21 are not adjacent . for this",
    ", we introduce a permutation @xmath71 , which reorders all the indices by the value of @xmath70 ranging from high to low .",
    "note that the construction of polar codes already implies the fact that for channels of the same type , their permutation mappings are the same .",
    "another fact about polar codes is that the polarization is uniform @xcite .",
    "consider polarizing two b - dmcs , for instance bscs with parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , then the information sets , denoted by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , satisfy @xmath76 in other words , if a particular channel index constructed from the worse channel ( bsc with larger transition probability ) polarizes to be noiseless , so does that of the better channel ( bsc with smaller transition probability ) .    , the reordered mutual information , are shown for both polarizations .",
    "the blue - solid plot represents the channel with higher transition probability @xmath72 , and the red - dashed for @xmath73 .",
    "three index categories are denoted by @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 in order . ]",
    "based on this observation , when polarizing two @xmath80 and @xmath81 with transition probabilities defined by ( [ fun : p_1 ] ) and ( [ fun : p_2 ] ) respectively , the indices after permutation @xmath82 can be divided into three categories ( illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : polarization ] ) . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath83 .    1 .   @xmath77 : both channels are good , i.e. @xmath84 2 .",
    "@xmath78 : only channel 2 is good , while channel 1 is bad , i.e. @xmath85 3 .",
    "@xmath79 : both channels are bad , i.e. @xmath86    denote the information sets for two channels as @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspondingly , then obviously @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , we have : @xmath89,\\label{fun : size_g}\\\\ & |\\mathcal{m}|=|\\mathcal{a}_2|-|\\mathcal{a}_1|=n[h(p_1)-h(p_2)],\\label{fun : size_m}\\\\ & |\\mathcal{b}|=n-|\\mathcal{a}_2|=n[h(p_2)+\\epsilon],\\label{fun : size_b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is a arbitrary small positive number .    for the fading channel , we consider the transmitter has no prior knowledge of channel states before transmitting , hence , coding over channels with indices in @xmath78 is challenging .",
    "observe that for those channels , with probability @xmath65 they are nearly noiseless , and with probability @xmath62 they are purely noisy . to this end , each channel can be modeled as a binary erasure channel ( bec ) from the viewpoint of blocks , and we denote this channel as @xmath91 .",
    "this intuition inspires our design of encoder and decoder for fading channels .",
    "the encoding process of polar coding for fading channel has two phases , hierarchically using polar codes to generate @xmath92-length codewords , where @xmath11 is blocklength and @xmath44 is the number of blocks .      consider a set of @xmath44-length block messages @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",

    "more precisely , because at the receiver end , channel state is available , then receiver can adopt the corresponding sc decoder for bsc based on the channel state observed .",

    "fig : decoder ] .",
    "we want to show the rate in proposed polar coding scheme achieves the capacity of converted fading channel given by ( [ fun : fading_capacity ] ) .",
    "intuitively , by using bsc sc decoders corresponding to channel states , the output from phase 1 successfully recovers all information bits in @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , for those with indices corresponding to @xmath78 , the decoder could decode correctly if channel state is @xmath139 , and set to erasures otherwise .",

    "as we have seen , polar coding schemes for both bsc and bec have relatively low complexity .",

    "more precisely , @xmath149 number of @xmath44-length polar codes as well as @xmath44 number of @xmath11-length polar codes are utilized .",
