    ", we describe @xmath0-stable graphical ( @xmath0-sg ) models , a new class of multivariate stable densities that can be represented as directed acyclic graphs ( dag ) with arbitrary network topologies .",

    "( bic ) . using simulated data for five benchmark network topologies ,",
    "we empirically show how @xmath0-sg models improve structure and parameter learning performance for linear regression networks with additive heavy - tailed noise .",
    "one motivation for the present work comes from potential applications to computational biology , especially in genomics , where bayesian network models of gene expression profiles are a popular tool  @xcite .",
    "a common approach to network models of gene expression involves learning linear regression - based gaussian graphical models .",
    "however , the distribution of experimental microarray intensities shows a clear skew and may not necessarily be best described by a gaussian density ( section  [ geneex ] ) .",
    "another aspect of microarray intensities is that they represent the average mrna concentration in a population of cells . assuming the number of mrna transcripts within each cell to be independent and identically distributed",
    ", the generalized central limit theorem suggests that the observed shape should asymptotically ( for large population size ) approach a stable density  @xcite .",
    "univariate stable distributions have previously been used to model gene expression data  @xcite and it is therefore natural to consider multivariate @xmath0-stable densities as models for mrna expression for larger sets of genes . in section  [ geneex ]",
    "we provide empirical evidence to support this reasoning .",
    "we further develop @xmath0-stable graphical ( @xmath0-sg ) models for quantifying differential expression of genes from microarray data belonging to phase iii of the hapmap project  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : section  [ intro ] describes the basic notation and background concepts for bayesian networks and stable densities .",
    "section  [ sgmodels ] introduces @xmath0-sg models and establishes that these models are bayesian networks that also represent multivariate stable distributions with finite spectral measures .",

    "furthermore , we establish how data samples from any @xmath0-sg model can be combined to generate samples from a partner symmetric @xmath0-sg model with identical network topology and regression coefficients . using these theoretical results we design stable , an efficient algorithm that combines ordering - based search ( obs )  @xcite for structure learning with the iteratively re - weighted least squares ( irls ) algorithm  @xcite for learning the regression parameters via least @xmath1 norm estimation .",
    "finally , in section  [ validation ] we implement the structure and parameter learning algorithm on simulated and expression microarray data sets .",
    "in this section we develop the theory and algorithms for learning @xmath0-sg models from data .",
    "first , we discuss some well - established results for bayesian networks and @xmath0-stable densities .",
    "we begin with an introduction to bayesian network models  @xcite for the joint probability distribution of a finite set of random variables @xmath2 .",
    "a bayesian network @xmath3 is specified by a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) @xmath4 ,",
    "whose vertices represent random variables in @xmath5 and a set of parameters @xmath6 , that determine the conditional probability distribution @xmath7 for each variable @xmath8 given the state of its parents @xmath9 in @xmath4  @xcite . we will overload the symbols @xmath10 and @xmath11 to represent both sets of random variables and their instantiations .",
    "the directed acyclic graph @xmath4 implies a factorization of the joint probability density into terms representing each variable @xmath12 and its parents @xmath13 ( called a _ family _ ) such that :    @xmath14    the dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath16 is usually specified by an appropriately chosen family of parametrized probability densities for the random variables , such as gaussian or @xmath17-normal . in this paper , we will use multivariate stable densities to model the random variables in @xmath5 .",
    "the primary motivation for modeling continuous random variables using stable distributions comes from the generalization of the central limit theorem to distributions with unbounded variance  @xcite . in the limit of large @xmath18 ,",
    "all sums of @xmath18 independent , identically distributed random variables approach a stable density .",
    "a formal definition for stable random variables can be provided in terms of the characteristic function ( fourier transform of the density function )    [ stabledef ] a _ stable random variable _",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ populations ]      we downloaded pre - processed data for 727 individuals from eight global population groups as reported in @xcite .",
    "details about the eight population groups are provided in table  [ populations ] . for each individual , the input data represented @xmath17-intensities for 21800 microarray probes that were quantile and median normalized , as described in the original paper @xcite . these microarray intensities provide a measure for mrna concentration within a sample of lymphoblastoid cells from each individual . before performing structure learning , we further processed each probe intensity as follows :    1 .   the log - intensity @xmath35 for each probe @xmath36",
    "was median - centered to obtain transformed log - intensities @xmath37 , ie .",
    ", the number of samples with positive log - intensity was half ( or 0.5 less than ) the total ( = 363=@xmath38 ) .",

    "2 .   the median - centered log - intensities were used to assign a rank @xmath39 to each probe @xmath36 , in decreasing order of variance . even for @xmath0-stable distributions ,",
    "variance of @xmath17 transformed data is finite  @xcite .",
    "this is also a standard technique for restricting computing time by selecting a subset of genes with most variation .",
    "the median - centered log - intensities @xmath40 were exponentiated to @xmath41 .",
    "4 .   the exponentiated - median - centered log - intensities @xmath42 for the top @xmath43 ranked probes were provided as input to stable ( for cross - validation ) and sgex ( for de quantification , as described in section  [ de ] ) . in the experiments reported here",
    "@xmath44 .",
    "we estimated @xmath0 over 1000 resampled bootstrap replicates of the data .",
    "this was meant as a diagnostic to assess the heavy - tailed nature of the intensities .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : cv]a , the data suggests a clear departure from a gaussian profile",
    ".     over 1000 bootstrap replicates . *",
    "b * shows comparative test set performance for mdc and ols based networks relative to an empty network ( no edges ) .",
    "* c * shows a heat map of @xmath45 that quantifies differential expression of a gene .",
    "the color for each column is normalized by scaling and centering . ]",
    "we performed a ten - fold cross - validation for the top 100 ranked probes from the hapmap data . since we wanted to compare mdc with ols - based learning , we report goodness of fit of the graphical model @xmath46 on the test set @xmath47 in terms of @xmath17 fractional lower order moments : @xmath48=\\sum_{x_i\\in\\mathcal{x}}\\bigl[\\frac{1}{p } \\log e(|x_{i}-\\sum_{x_j\\in pa(x_i)}w_{ij}x_j|^{p } ) \\bigr]\\nonumber\\ ] ] where , @xmath49 represents the regression co - efficient for the edge @xmath50 .",
    "clearly , if most of the variation in @xmath12 can be explained by the parent set @xmath13 , the corresponding @xmath51 will be small . for @xmath52",
    ", @xmath51 is identical to the negative log - likelihood for gaussian graphical models has zero mean , since the data is centro - symmetrized before cross - validation . ] .",
    "however , the second order moment diverges for @xmath53 ( lemma  [ flom ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 provide a more robust estimate for evaluating the model on test set for heavy - tailed noise ( @xmath53 ) .    figure  [ fig : cv]b shows the average ( over the ten - folds ) of @xmath51 for mdc ( blue ) and ols - based ( red ) models . in each case",
    ", the curves show the difference in @xmath51 between optimal ( mdc or ols ) network and an empty network ( null ) .",
    "this allows us to also assess the deterioration in test set performance by treating each gene as an independent random variable ( a common assumption in de quantification ) .",
    "although the data set contains only 727 samples , we see a clear improvement in test set performance of @xmath0-sg models ( mdc curve ) relative to gaussian graphical models ( ols curve ) .      finally , we discuss sgex , a new technique for quantifying differential expression using @xmath0-sg models .",
    "sgex is based on cross - validation for assessing de of a gene across different conditions . for the hapmap data",
    ", we chose each of the eight population groups in turn as the test set and learnt the optimal @xmath0-sg model for the rest of the samples .",
    "we then estimated @xmath54 , the change in negative log - likelihood per sample between the test set set @xmath55 and the training set as a measure of de for each probe @xmath36 @xmath56~,~p\\in(-1,\\alpha)\\nonumber\\ ] ] here , @xmath57 is the expectation value for population @xmath55 ( test set ) and @xmath58 for the rest ( training set ) .",
    "note that lemma  [ flom ] guarantees that rhs of the previous equation is indeed independent of @xmath59 .",
    "for the calculation reported here @xmath60 , just as it was during structure learning .",
    "thus , @xmath54 measures the average increase ( or decrease ) in log - dispersion for the noise variable @xmath61 corresponding to probe @xmath36 within population @xmath55 .",
    "this density is represented as a heat map in figure  [ fig : cv]c .",
    "we should point out that a higher ( or lower ) dispersion for the noise variable associated with a gene in the test set does not necessarily imply over ( or under ) expression of a gene in the test set population .",
    "the change in dispersion could also be due to a change in network topology or regression coefficients for the test set population .",
    "in this paper we have introduced and developed the theory for efficiently learning @xmath0-sg models from data . in particular ,",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is to show how the bic can be asymptotically reduced to the mdc for @xmath0-sg models .",
    "this result makes it feasible to efficiently learn the structure of these models , since the log - likelihood term does not have a closed form expression in general .",
    "we have also empirically validated the resultant algorithm stable on both simulated and microarray data . in both cases ,",
    "the presence of heavy - tailed noise has a clear effect on learning performance of ols based methods .",
    "based on these results , we recommend a bootstrapped estimation of @xmath0 as an effective and computationally efficient diagnostic to assess the applicability of ols based gaussian graphical models .",
    "we have also described sgex , a new technique for quantifying differential expression from microarray data .",
    "@xmath0-sg models may also have wider applicability to other aspects of computational biology , especially to data from next - generation sequencing technologies .",
    "in addition to mrna expression measurements ( rna - seq experiments ) , @xmath0-sg models may prove helpful for other experiments , such as protein - dna binding ( chip - seq experiments ) and dna accessibility measurements ( dnase - seq and faire - seq experiments ) .",
    "finally , we should mention that there are several potential applications of @xmath0-sg models beyond computational biology .",
    "in particular , image processing provides several problem instances where there is a need to relate different regions of the image .",
    "for example , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) experiments generate a series of images highlighting activity sites in the brain in response to stimuli .",
    "bayesian networks are an effective way of modeling statistical relations between different areas of the brain and the stimuli  @xcite .",
    "stable distributions may provide a better model for such applications . another image processing application with potentials for @xmath0-sg models",
    "is remote sensing images of the earth @xcite where image histograms demonstrate clearly skewed and heavy tailed characteristics @xcite .",
