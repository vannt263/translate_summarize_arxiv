    "in astrophysical environments , dust grains condense in the metal - rich cooling gas such as the stellar winds from evolved stars and the expanding ejecta of novae and supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "once newly formed dust grains are injected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , they cause interstellar extinction and diffuse infrared emission , and also serve as catalysts for h@xmath8 formation and building materials of such planets as we live on . hence , the investigation of formation and evolution of dust is indispensable in disclosing the nature of objects at high redshifts , the radiative process and energy balance in the ism , and the formation history of stars and planetary systems",
    ".    in particular , the origin of dust has been hotly debated since the discoveries of a huge amount of dust grains at redshifts higher than @xmath9 ( gall et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) .",
    "in an early epoch of the universe , core - collapse sne arising from short - lived massive stars are likely to be dominant sources of dust ( e.g. , dwek et al .",
    "in fact , recent far - infrared to submillimeter observations of young supernova remnants , sn 1987a ( matsuura et al .",
    "2011 ; lakievi et al .",
    "2012 ) , cas a ( sibthorpe et al .  2010 ; barlow et al .  2010 ) , and crab ( gomez et al .",
    "2012 ) , have reported the presence of subsolar mass of cool dust formed in the ejecta , which seems to be high enough to account for the observed amount of dust at high redshifts .",
    "however , these cool grains have not yet undergone the destruction in the hot gas swept up by the reverse and forward shocks , and thus their mass does not necessarily represent the amount of dust finally ejected by sne .",
    "what fraction of newly formed grains can survive on their journeys to and in the ism heavily depends on their sizes at the time of formation ( e.g. , nozawa et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "thus , in order to reveal the roles of sne as sources of dust in the universe , it is essential to understand not only the total mass but also the size distribution of dust produced in the ejecta of sne .    the formation process of dust in the sn ejecta has been studied mainly with the classical nucleation theory and its extension ( kozasa et al .",
    "1989 , 1991 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011 ; bianchi & schneider 2007 ) . in the nucleation theory ,",
    "the condensation of dust is described by the formation of stable seed nuclei ( called critical clusters ) and their growth , where the formation rate of critical clusters is derived by assuming the nucleation current to be in a steady state .",
    "this theory enables us to predict the size distribution and mass of condensing grain species , and the results of the dust formation calculations have nicely explained the mass of dust formed in sn 1987a ( kozasa et al .",
    "1991 ) and the formation and evolution processes of dust in cas a ( nozawa et al .  2010 ) .",
    "however , it has been argued that the validity for the application of classical nucleation theory could not be justified in the rarefied gas typical of dust - forming region of astrophysical interest ( donn & nuth 1985 and references therein ) ; in much less dense systems , the timescale on which the nucleation current achieves a steady state must be longer than the timescales of evolutions of the gas density and temperature , which would render the application of the steady  state nucleation rate questionable .",
    "on the other hand , paquette & nuth ( 2011 ) suggested that the lack of the steady  state condition is unlikely to change the radius and number density of newly formed grains significantly .",
    "they showed that the resulting size distribution of dust is little affected even if the steady  state nucleation rate is reduced by a few orders of magnitude , although they did not clarify the effect of a non - steady state on the formation process of dust .    in this paper ,",
    "we develop a method managing the dust formation process without postulating a steady state , which is expected to be more appropriate in astrophysical application . in section 2",
    ", we formulate the non - steady  state dust formation process , including chemical reactions at the time of formation of clusters and grains . after describing a simple model of the time evolutions of the gas temperature and density in the ejecta of sne in section 3 , we present , in section 4 , the results of the calculations for the formation of c and mgsio@xmath0 grains and discuss the effect of the non - steady state and its dependence on the physical conditions in the ejecta . in section 5 , we demonstrate that the average radius and condensation efficiency can be uniquely determined by the ratio of the supersaturation timescale to the collision timescale at the time when the condensation efficiency rises to @xmath10 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we also present the detailed derivation of the steady  state nucleation rate for the formation of compound grains such as silicates in appendix a.",
    "in this section , we formulate the non - steady  state formation of clusters and dust grains accompanied by chemical reactions , by means of a kinetic approach . most of grain species of astrophysical interest , like silicate , have no monomer molecule with the same chemical composition as the condensate .",
    "this implies that the formation of such compound grains proceeds via the chemical reactions involving the relevant gas species , while the reaction pathways and their rate constants are not well known .",
    "one of the methods of evading the difficulty in treating the formation of compound grains without the detailed knowledge of the chemical pathways and reaction constants is to employ the concept of a key species ( key molecule ) that is defined as a gaseous reactant with the least collisional frequency among the gaseous reactants , as proposed by kozasa & hasegawa ( 1987 ) . in this method ,",
    "two - body reactions between a cluster and the key molecule are considered to control the kinetics of the chemical reaction ; the concept of key molecule has been applied also for the growth process of compound grains in circumstellar envelopes as well as molecular clouds ( e.g. , ferrarotti & gail 2001 ; zhukovska et al .",
    "2008 ) . in what follows",
    ", we refer to the cluster composed of @xmath11key molecules as @xmath11mer , and assume that clusters are spherical .",
    "we also assume the temperature of clusters to be the same as the gas temperature .",
    "first , for simplicity , we shall consider a cooling gas in a closed box with the initial concentration of the key molecule @xmath12 at a time @xmath13 . as the gas cools down",
    ", the condensation of dust grains proceeds through formation and growth of @xmath11mer clusters via the attachment of the key molecules . in principle",
    ", the time evolution of concentration @xmath14 of @xmath11mers can be described by a set of differential equations @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the net current density from @xmath17mer to @xmath11mer .",
    "here we consider that a cluster containing more key molecules than @xmath18 can be treated as a macroscopic grain ( hereafter simply called `` grain '' ) .",
    "given the concentration @xmath19 and the mass @xmath20 of the key molecule , the growth rate of grains is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the grain radius , @xmath23 is the sticking probability of the key molecule onto grains , @xmath24 is the volume of the condensate per key molecule , @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath26 is the temperature of the gas , and @xmath27 is the supersaturation ratio .",
    "the successive formation of clusters and the growth of grains cause the depletion of the key molecules .",
    "the time variation of the concentration @xmath19 of the key molecule is determined from the equation of the mass conservation ; @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hypothetical radius of the condensate per key molecule , and @xmath30 is the radius of a grain that reaches @xmath18 at @xmath31 and is measured at @xmath32 .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe how the current density @xmath33 and the supersaturation ratio @xmath27 can be presented according to the chemical reaction at the time of formation .      in this subsection , as a reference , we consider the formation of clusters whose chemical composition is the same as that of the key molecule ( hereafter we refer to such a grain as a `` single - element grain '' ) in order to clarify how the formation process of clusters is formulated by means of the kinetic approach . in this case",
    ", the formation of clusters proceeds through attachment and detachment of a key molecule as follows ; @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the key molecule and the @xmath11mer cluster , respectively .",

    "thus , considering that collisions of monomers control the kinetics of attachment , we evaluate @xmath38 as follows , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the sticking probability of a monomer onto an @xmath11mer , @xmath42 is the kronecker s delta , and @xmath43 is the reduced mass of a monomer and an @xmath11-mer .",

    "is described as follows .",
    "as can be seen from ( c ) and ( d ) of figures 2 and 3 , the increase in @xmath120 , induced by the decrease in gas temperature with time , leads to the formation of clusters with larger @xmath11 progressively .",

    "note that the onset time of dust formation is later for c grains ( @xmath220 ) than for mgsio@xmath0 grains ( @xmath221 ) , which stems partly from the longer timescale of supersaturation and partly from the larger surface tension : @xmath222 10 days and @xmath223 erg @xmath190 for c grains ( @xmath222 2.5 days and @xmath224 erg @xmath190 for mgsio@xmath0 grains ) .",

    "in addition , the steady  state value excellently matches the steady  state current density @xmath210 , as is seen from ( b ) and ( d ) in figures 2 and 3 , where we overplot the results obtained from the steady model ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the behavior of the formation process of clusters and grains in this high - density case can be qualitatively understood by inspecting the time evolution of @xmath235 regulating the backward reactions in equation ( 45 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath235 is a decreasing function of @xmath11 , and in a supersaturated gas , it becomes below unity for @xmath11 larger than a critical size @xmath208 approximately given as @xmath236 for @xmath237 .",
    "note that this expression for @xmath208 is equivalent to that for the steady  state current density as defined by equation ( a9 ) . at the initial phase of @xmath238",
    ", @xmath208 is very large ( @xmath239 ) ( see figures 2(c ) and 3(c ) ) , so the backward reactions are dominant ( @xmath240 ) for any size of @xmath11mers . in this case , the abundances of @xmath11mers at each time approximately take the values , @xmath241 , and the current to larger @xmath11mers is considerably smaller ( @xmath242 ) .",

    "furthermore , the agreement of @xmath201 with @xmath210 can be interpreted as follows ; even if @xmath120 is high enough , the backward reactions remain predominant for @xmath249 , where the relation @xmath241 holds .",

    "hence , the current density for the formation of @xmath64mers @xmath201 is essentially equal to the steady  state current density @xmath210 .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the application of the steady  state current density could be valid as long as the consumption of the key molecules due to formation and growth of clusters and grains causes the supersaturation ratio @xmath27 to decrease in the course of time evolution of gas density and temperature , as is demonstrated in the case of a high initial gas density",
    ".    figures 2(e ) and 3(e ) show the final size distributions of grains and clusters .",
    "the size distribution is lognormal  like with @xmath252 @xmath253 m for c grains and @xmath254 @xmath253 m for mgsio@xmath0 grains .",
    "since the size distributions of grains follow the time evolution of @xmath201 and @xmath210 is equal to @xmath201 , we can see that the size distribution in the non - steady model is the same as those in the steady model . in this high - density case with the final condensation efficiency @xmath255 ,",
    "the abundance of the key molecules locked in the clusters is extremely small ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "our calculations show that , when the initial concentration is as high as @xmath257 @xmath190 , all carbon atoms and sio molecules are ultimately locked in grains with the size distributions identical to those in the steady models .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show the formation processes of c and mgsio@xmath0 grains , respectively , for @xmath258 @xmath190 , @xmath200 days , and @xmath199 .",
    "even for such a low initial gas density , the formation of @xmath11mers progresses as @xmath120 increases , as is the same as the high - density case .",
    "however , even if grains with @xmath259 are produced , they can not grow efficiently through attachment of the key molecules because the collision timescale is considerably longer ( @xmath260 110 ) . thus , despite the fact that the formation and growth of clusters and grains significantly consume the key molecules , @xmath120 continues to increase ( figures 4(c ) and 5(c ) ) , and @xmath201 gradually decreases after passing the peak in contrast to the high - density case ( figures 4(d ) and 5(d ) ) , which results in the formation of many small grains with @xmath261 . finally , the depletion due to formation of clusters and grains and/or the dilution due to the expansion of the gas makes the concentration of the key molecules too low to advance the further growth , and the abundances of clusters approach to the constant values ( see figures 4(a ) and 5(a ) )",
    ".    figures 4(b ) and 5(b ) compare the time evolutions of @xmath201 ( and @xmath210 ) , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 between the non - steady and the steady models .",
    "it can be seen that the non - steady current density @xmath201 rises up at a time later than the steady  state current density @xmath210 , corresponding to the later onset time of dust formation , and that its peak value is much smaller than that in the steady model .",
    "this is at odds with the high - density case , indicating that the steady model is no longer appropriate for this low - density case with @xmath262 during the evolution . for clusters with @xmath249 ,",
    "as mentioned in the previous subsection , @xmath160 evolves as @xmath241 , and @xmath263 at each time is on order of @xmath210 ( c.f . ,",
    "equation ( 62 ) ) .",
    "however , the collision timescale is too long for the current densities @xmath209 to establish a steady state at @xmath247 , so @xmath201 remains much lower than @xmath264 ( figures 4(d ) and 5(d ) ) .",
    "there also appear differences in the final average radius and condensation efficiency of dust grains between the non - steady and steady models .",
    "the final condensation efficiency in the non - steady model is @xmath265 for c grains ( @xmath266 for mgsio@xmath0 grains ) , which is lower than @xmath267 in the steady model for both the grain species . in both the models ,",
    "the key molecules are little left in the gas phase ( @xmath268 ) in the end , indicating that 70 % ( 99 % ) of them are finally bound to clusters for the non - steady model .",
    "on the other hand , the final average radius of dust grains is larger for the non - steady model ( @xmath269 @xmath253 m for c grains and 0.0011 @xmath253 m for mgsio@xmath0 grains ) than for the steady model ( @xmath270 @xmath253 m for c grains and 0.0005 @xmath253 m for mgsio@xmath0 grains ) .",
    "the discrepancies in the average grain radius and condensation efficiency between the two models simply reflect the difference in the minimum size considered as grains . as can be seen from figures 4(e ) and 5(e )",
    ", the final size distribution in the steady model is quite similar to the combined size distribution of grains and clusters in the non - steady model .",
    "this is because @xmath208 and @xmath3 are the same in both the models , so the number of @xmath208mer formed at a given time and the growth rate are essentially identical .",
    "however , in the steady model , clusters that meet @xmath271 are taken as bulk grains , and @xmath208 is normally less than 10 , even down to @xmath21712 in the low density case as shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "thus , the steady model , which regards small @xmath11mers as grains , leads to a smaller average grain radius and a higher condensation efficiency .",
    "although we can not have a clear number of constituent atoms to distinguish between small clusters and grains , it must be unreasonable to consider clusters with @xmath272 to hold the properties of bulk grains .",
    "the results of calculations for this low initial density clearly attest that the application of the steady  state current density overestimates the condensation efficiency and underestimates the average grain radius for dust formation in less dense and/or rapidly cooling environments . also , it may be useful to point out here that the application of the steady  state current density with a given cut - off value of critical size ( e.g. , bianchi & schneider 2007 ) in low - density / rapidly cooling environments , arguing the inadequacy of the extension to smaller critical sizes , leads to the considerable depression of the condensation efficiency and enhancement of the average grain radius , and can not reproduce the combined size distribution of clusters and grains .      in the subsections 4.1 and 4.2 , we have demonstrated how the initial concentration of the key molecule affects the formation process and properties of newly formed grains . in this subsection , we investigate the dependence of other free parameters @xmath178 and @xmath179 on the formation process , average radius , and size distribution of dust grains .    figure 6(a ) plots the formation process of c grains for @xmath273 100 , 300 , and 600 days with @xmath274 @xmath190 and @xmath275 1.25 .",
    "the results of the calculations show that a larger @xmath178 leads to a smaller peak of @xmath201 as well as a little earlier onset time of dust formation @xmath214 .",
    "this is explained as follows : as seen from equation ( 57 ) , the timescale of supersaturation in terms of @xmath276 , @xmath277 is independent of @xmath178 , while the timescale of grain growth , @xmath278 , is inversely proportional to @xmath178 .",
    "this means that the increase in @xmath178 makes grain growth more active but has little impact on the number of clusters at a given time @xmath276 .",
    "therefore , for a larger @xmath178 , dust grains capture the key molecules more efficiently through their growth , which causes a faster rise of @xmath213 and a faster drop of @xmath201 ( a smaller peak of @xmath201 ) and results in the grain size distribution weighted toward a larger radius ( see figure 6(b ) ) .",
    "thus , the increase in @xmath178 enhances the effect of grain growth relative to formation of clusters and act to produce dust grains with large average radii .",
    "figure 7 gives the results of the calculations for the formation of mgsio@xmath0 , adopting @xmath275 1.25 , 1.4 , and 1.6 for @xmath274 @xmath190 and @xmath178 = 300 days .",
    "for a larger @xmath179 , which corresponds to a more rapid cooling of the gas , the onset time of dust formation is earlier , and @xmath201 has a higher peak . again considering the timescale in terms of @xmath276 , the timescale of supersaturation , @xmath279 decreases with increasing @xmath179 , whereas the timescale of grain growth , @xmath280 , increases .",
    "hence , for a larger @xmath179 , a more rapid increase in @xmath120 as well as a more rapid decrease in @xmath208 leads to the formation of a larger number of clusters with @xmath247 at an earlier time before grain growth efficiently consumes the key molecules . here",
    "it should be noted that the collision timescale @xmath3 in the models considered here is still short enough so that the consumption of the key molecules due to grain growth makes @xmath120 decrease during the evolution .",
    "consequently , in the model with larger @xmath179 , @xmath201 increases more rapidly and has a higher and narrower peak at an earlier time , and the average grain radius as well as the peak radius of size distribution becomes smaller , as seen from figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the increase in @xmath179 makes the formation of clusters more active relative to grain growth and induces the formation of dust grains with small average radii even if @xmath281 is not much larger than unity .",
    "the objects to be clarified in the study of dust formation in astrophysical environments are not only the chemical composition of dust grains but also their amount and size distribution . in the ejecta of sne ,",
    "the knowledge on size distribution of newly formed dust is crucial for unraveling what amount and size of dust grains are finally ejected from sne to the ism , because the destruction efficiency of dust by the reverse shock heavily depends on the size distribution ( e.g. , nozawa et al .",
    "our results show that the size distribution of dust formed for given time evolutions of gas density and temperature is lognormal  like as long as @xmath282 during the formation of dust .",
    "therefore , the average grain radius can be taken as a representative measurement of the size distribution .",
    "the condensation efficiency is also a fundamental quantity in estimating the mass of newly formed dust . in this section ,",
    "we explore how the average grain radius and condensation efficiency can be constrained from a physical condition at the time of dust formation , and derive the scaling relations for the average radius and condensation efficiency , referring to the results of the calculations presented in the previous section .",
    "in addition , we clarify in what conditions the steady  state nucleation rate is applicable .",
    "then , we shall present some examples of the application of the scaling relations for the formation of dust in sne .",
    "the results in section 4 demonstrate that the formation process of dust is determined by the competition between the formation of clusters and the growth of grains .",
    "although the onset time of dust formation ( and the condensation time at which the current density @xmath201 reaches the maximum ) , average grain radius , and condensation efficiency depend on @xmath12 , @xmath179 , and @xmath178 in a complicated manner , we have shown that the behavior of formation processes of dust grains can be qualitatively interpreted in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath3 during the formation of dust .",
    "it has been shown in the studies based on the steady  state nucleation rate that the average radius and number density of dust grains formed in a cooling gas undergoing macroscopic motion can be scaled by a non - dimensional quantity @xmath283 at the condensation time when the nucleation rate reaches the maximum ( e.g. , hasegawa & kozasa 1988 ) .",
    "the formation time of dust is the most direct information that can be obtained from observations of sne .",
    "hence , it is useful to relate the average grain radius and condensation efficiency to the gas density and temperature at the time of dust formation , in order to get the information on physical conditions in the ejecta from the observations and vice versa .",
    "one of the best indicators for the formation time of dust would be the condensation time , @xmath284 , defined as the time when @xmath201 has a peak . however , the depletion of the key molecules due to the formation and growth of clusters and grains at @xmath284 is considerably large ( @xmath285 0.10.2 at @xmath284 ) , which has significant effects on the relevant physical quantities .",
    "thus , we adopt , as the time of dust formation , the onset time of dust formation , @xmath7 , defined as the time at which @xmath213 reaches @xmath10 . then , the non - dimensional physical quantity @xmath6 characterizing the formation process of dust grains is given as @xmath286 where @xmath287 and @xmath288 , and @xmath289 ( @xmath290 ) for c grains ( mgsio@xmath0 grains ) . in equation ( 63 ) , we employ the approximation @xmath291 ( see equation ( 57 ) ) , although we have calculated @xmath6 without using this approximation in the following figures .",
    "figure 8 presents the final average grain radius @xmath2 and condensation efficiency @xmath1 as a function of @xmath6 calculated for @xmath275 1.1 , 1.3 , 1.5 , and 1.7 by covering a wide range of @xmath12 and @xmath178 .",
    "the figures show that , as @xmath6 increases , @xmath2 and @xmath1 increase , and @xmath267 at @xmath292 2030 for both c and mgsio@xmath0 grains ; for a larger @xmath6 , grain growth becomes more dominant over the formation of clusters , and as a result larger grains are formed to lock up all of the key molecules .",
    "the remarkable consequence of figure 8 is that @xmath2 and @xmath1 for different @xmath179 ( especially for @xmath293 ) are , respectively , plotted almost completely as a single curve for both c grains ( figure 8(a ) ) and mgsio@xmath0 grains ( figure 8(b ) ) .",
    "this means that the average grain radius and condensation efficiency can be uniquely determined by one parameter @xmath6 , except for c grains formed in extremely slowly cooling gas with low densities corresponding to the case of @xmath294 with @xmath295 . in the figures , we also plot @xmath2 and @xmath1 from the steady model for @xmath296 .",
    "they deviate from those from the non - steady model at @xmath297 , where the steady model predicts too small @xmath2 to be regarded as bulk grains with keeping @xmath267 . in other words ,",
    "the steady  state nucleation rate is applicable only if @xmath298 .",

    "equation ( 64 ) reproduces the calculated average radii with the error less than 5 % for @xmath305 .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the scaling relations given above are independent of the initial conditions of the calculations and the time evolution of the gas density .",
    "in fact , we have performed the dust formation calculations for expanding gas flows with a constant velocity by changing @xmath179 , and confirmed that the resulting @xmath2 and @xmath1 entirely coincide with those shown in figure 8 .",

    "these c grains are likely to have formed not in the ejecta but in relatively dense clumps in the shocked circumstellar shell , but it would be interesting to compare with our results .",

( 2001 ) tried to generalize the formulation for the steady  state nucleation rate and derived an analytic formula in which the effect of chemical reactions at the time of formation is included as a correction factor in a form of functions of partial pressures of reactants except for the key species and products as well as the standard gas pressure .",
    "however , the formula is incomplete because the nucleation rate depends on the standard gas pressure explicitly in the case that the number of product molecules is different from that of reactant molecules except for the key species .",
    "thus , in this appendix , we reformulate the analytic formula for the rate of the steady  state nucleation proceeding through the chemical reactions at the time of formation .    here",
    "we consider the formation of dust grains through the chemical reactions ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) . in a steady state ,",
    "the current density @xmath33 from @xmath17mer to @xmath11mer is independent of @xmath11 , being identical to the steady  state nucleation rate @xmath326 .",
    "thus , equations ( 19 ) and ( 33 ) lead to the following relations , respectively , @xmath327 and @xmath328 where @xmath329 is defined by equation ( 20 ) . by summing up equation ( a1 ) and equation ( a2 ) multiplied by @xmath330 successively , the nucleation rate @xmath326 can be derived from the equation @xmath331 by applying equations ( 28 ) and ( 35 ) , the factor @xmath332 on the second term in the right - hand side of equation ( a3 ) is written as @xmath333 \\right\\ }   \\equiv \\frac{1}{c_1 \\pi } \\exp\\left(\\gamma'\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath334 - \\left ( n - \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\right ) \\ln s,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the supersaturation ratio defined by equation ( 30 ) . since @xmath335 and @xmath336 for @xmath337 , the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( a3 ) approaches to zero for @xmath338 as @xmath339 .",
    "then , the steady state nucleation rate @xmath326 is given by @xmath340 as long as @xmath341 , the summation in equation ( a6 ) can be replaced with the integration , and the nucleation rate @xmath326 can be approximately calculated as @xmath342 under the capillary approximation given by equation ( 40 ) , @xmath132 is expressed as @xmath343 and have a maximum at @xmath208 given by @xmath344 thus , the integration of equation ( a7 ) with the saddle - point method results in the steady state nucleation rate given by @xmath345,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , for @xmath237 , @xmath346.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this revised formula of the steady state nucleation rate includes a correction factor @xmath122 defined as @xmath347^{\\frac{1}{\\omega } } = \\left [   \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^i \\left ( c^a_k / c_1 \\right)^{\\nu_k } }       { \\prod_{k=1}^j \\left ( c^b_k / c_1 \\right)^{\\eta_k } } \\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\omega}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that the factor @xmath122 is expressed as functions of concentration ratios of gaseous reactants / products to the key molecule and does not include the standard pressure @xmath52 explicitly .    in most of the past works for the formation of dust in the ejecta of sne ( e.g. , nozawa et al .  2003 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ) , the factor @xmath122 has been set to be unity . since @xmath348 for the formation of a multi - element grain with no gaseous product such as in the ejecta of sne ( see nozawa et al .",
    "2003 ) , the revised formula provides a nucleation rate larger than the previous one ; for the elemental abundances of the gas ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) for the formation of mgsio@xmath0 used in the text , the revised formula presents the nucleation rate only by a factor of @xmath349 higher than the old one .",
    "this enhancement can not be significant because paquette & nuth ( 2011 ) showed that the resulting size distribution of dust is little affected even if the steady state nucleation rate is changed by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "here we describe how the change in @xmath64 in equation ( 1 ) affects the formation process of dust as well as the average radius and condensation efficiency of newly formed grains .",
    "first of all , as demonstrated in section 4.1 and discussed in section 5 , the change of @xmath64 does not influence the results of calculations as long as the formation of dust grains proceeds under the condition of @xmath350 and @xmath351 , because the current densities @xmath209 for @xmath229 achieve a steady  state value , being independent of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , here we examine the effect of change in @xmath64 for the model in which the non - steady  state effect for the formation process of grains is significant .",
    "figure 10(a ) presents the time evolutions of the current @xmath201 , average grain radius @xmath212 , and condensation efficiency @xmath213 of c grains for @xmath243 , 300 , and 1000 with @xmath352 @xmath190 , @xmath200 days , and @xmath199 .",
    "the figure shows that , as @xmath64 increases , the onset time of dust formation is slightly delayed , and the peak value of @xmath201 decreases .",
    "in addition , a larger @xmath64 leads to a smaller @xmath213 and a larger @xmath212 : @xmath353 and @xmath354 @xmath253 m for @xmath243 , while @xmath355 and @xmath356 @xmath253 m for @xmath357 .",
    "thus , the formation process as well as the resulting properties of dust grains seems to depend on the adopted value of @xmath64 .",
    "however , we recognize that the dependence of @xmath64 is superficial . as is seen from the final size distributions displayed in figure 10(b ) , where the values for @xmath358 and 1000 are shifted down , respectively , by factors of 0.1 and 0.01 for clarity , the combined size distributions of clusters and grains are identical with each other , regardless of @xmath64 .",
    "it should be noted that this demonstrates that the change in @xmath64 does not influence the formation processes of clusters and grains themselves .",
    "the independence of the combined size distribution on @xmath64 can be understood as follows ; the evolutions of @xmath209 and @xmath160 are the same for @xmath359 in all the three cases . on the other hand , for @xmath360 , the current density @xmath361 under the condition that @xmath362 , as can be seen from equations ( 42 ) and ( 45 ) .",
    "thus , the combined size distribution can be expected to be independent of @xmath363 since , in the model considered here , @xmath120 is not depressed very much by the depletion of the key molecules due to grain growth .",
    "the increase in @xmath64 only enhances the minimal size of grains , which results in the reduced number of atoms finally locked in grains ( that is , condensation efficiency ) and the increased average radius of grains for the given combined size distribution of clusters and grains .    in conclusion ,",
    "the change in @xmath64 does not vary the formation process of dust grains but affects the resulting condensation efficiency and average radius of grains .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is important only for dust formation at low gas densities where the average radius of newly formed grains is very small ( @xmath364 @xmath253 m ) , as is exemplified above .",
    "it should be kept in mind that , even if @xmath64 is enhanced from @xmath243 to 1000 , the minimal size of grains is only increased by a factor of @xmath365 .",
    "we also note that small grains formed in the sn ejecta would be destroyed quickly by the passage of the reverse shock before being injected into the ism ( nozawa et al .  2007 , 2010 ;",
    "silvia et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "thus , when we consider the final mass of dust ejected from sne , the uncertainty in the mass of small grains , resulting from the uncertainty in @xmath64 , could not be important .",
