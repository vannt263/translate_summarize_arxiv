    "searches for compact dark matter toward the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) and the galactic bulge identified numerous microlensing events in the past decade ( macho , @xcite @xcite ; eros , @xcite @xcite ; ogle , @xcite @xcite ; duo , ) . in parallel to these observations",
    ", a lot of effort has been spent on the prediction of the number , the spatial distribution , the amplitude , and the duration of lensing events toward these targets .",
    "the underlying models require knowledge of density and velocity distribution , as well as of the luminosity and mass function of lensing and lensed stars .",
    "the halo macho mass fraction and lens mass are free parameters . from that , the contributions of self - lensing and halo - lensing is obtained .",
    "the self - lensing predictions ( minimum lensing that has to occur due to star - star lensing ) serve as a sanity check for observations and models .",
    "an excess of lensing relative to self - lensing can then be attributed to halo lensing , from which the macho parameters are finally inferred .",
    "@xcite was the first to present such a lensing model for the galaxy halo and to estimate the probability of lensing ( i.e. , a magnification larger than 1.34 ) taking place at any time .",
    "this probability is also called the microlensing optical depth . on the basis of this work @xcite evaluated the optical depth with more realistic assumptions on halo density and velocity structure .",
    "he also obtained the event rate and distributions for lensing timescales and amplifications .",
    "@xcite related the einstein timescale distribution of the events to the microlensing rate and optical depth .",
    "they evaluated these distributions for several axisymmetric disk - halo models in the framework of the macho project .",
    "any microlensing light curve can be characterized by the maximum magnification , the time to cross the einstein radius ( einstein time ) and the time of the event .",
    "the first two observables depend on the line - of - sight distance of the source and lens , the minimum projected transverse lens - source distance ( impact parameter ) , transverse lens - source velocity , and lens mass .",
    "these quantities therefore can not be extracted separately from an individual lensing event ; instead , one can only derive probability distributions for them ( see @xcite @xcite and ) .",
    "most interesting are of course the object masses responsible for the measured lensing light curves : @xcite have derived the lens mass probability function for an event with given einstein time and amplification . @xcite have determined the macho mass spectrum from 51 macho candidates using their observed einstein times .",
    "blending has proven to be a severe limitation in the analysis of microlensing events .",
    "it can be overcome partly by using low - noise , high spatial resolution _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images for measurements of the unlensed source fluxes ( see @xcite @xcite ) . for extragalactic objects , however , this can provide a precise source flux for a fraction of lensed stars only .",
    "one can also use an advanced technique called difference imaging analysis , which is insensitive to crowding and allows to measure pixel flux differences in highly crowded fields at the poisson noise level .",
    "therefore , lensing searches could be extended to more distant targets like m31 ( agape , ; columbia - vatt , @xcite @xcite ; wecapp , @xcite ; point - agape , , ; mega , ; slott - agape , @xcite @xcite , ; nms , @xcite @xcite ) , or m87 @xcite .",
    "@xcite called microlensing of unresolved sources `` pixel - lensing '' .",
    "this definition encompasses surveys at the crowding limit as well as extragalactic microlensing experiments ( e.g. , toward m31 or m87 ) where hundreds of stars contribute to the flux within 1 pixel .",
    "gould ( and also ) showed that the comparison of pixel fluxes at different epochs can extend the search for microlensing events up to distances of a few megaparsecs . applying his equations",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite obtained the optical depth and distributions of timescales and event rates for a pixel - lensing survey toward m31 .",
    "if one does not know the flux of the unlensed source accurately ( i.e. , if one is not in the classical microlensing regime anymore ) , the information that can be extracted from light curves is reduced .",
    "@xcite were the first to note that the light curve maximum does not provide the maximum magnification of the source anymore , and , second , one can not obtain the einstein time from the fwhm time of an event ( since the latter is a product of the einstein time and a function of the magnification at maximum ) .",
    "this initiated efforts to deal with the lacking knowledge of the einstein timescales in the pixel - lensing regime ( see @xcite ) and the suggestion to extract the einstein time using the width of the `` tails '' of the lensing light curves by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , it is more straightforward to compare quantities that one can easily measure in an experiment with model predictions for the same quantity .",
    "the two independent and most precisely measurable observables are the flux excess of the light curve at its maximum and its fwhm timescale .",
    "@xcite followed that strategy and derived the event rate as a function of the fwhm timescale of the events .",
    "we proceed in that direction and calculate the contributions to the event rate as a function of the event s fwhm time and maximum excess flux , because both the excess flux and timescale determine the event s detectability .",
    "the definition of gould for pixel - lensing may imply that a pixel - lensing event should be called a microlensing event , if its source has been resolved ( e.g. , with _",
    "hst _ images ) after the event has been identified from ground .",
    "analogously , one could feel forced to call a microlensing event a pixel - lensing event , once it has turned out that `` the source star '' is a blend of several stars , and therefore the source flux is not known . therefore , the classification of an event as a pixel - lensing event or a microlensing event is not unique .",
    "one can take the following viewpoint : the physical processes are the same , and therefore classical microlensing is a special case of pixel - lensing , in which the source flux probability distribution is much more narrow than the stellar luminosity function , i.e. , the distribution function used in the pixel - lensing regime .",
    "the two methods only differ in how to analyze a light curve and how to derive the probability distribution for the source flux : one can make use of a noisy and potentially biased baseline value of the light curve ( hence , stay in the classical microlensing regime ) , or ignore the baseline value and obtain a source flux estimate from the wings of the light curve ( analyze the difference light curve ) .",
    "other possibilities are to obtain the source flux from an additional , direct measurement or to constrain its distribution by theory .",
    "after having determined the source flux probability distribution by one of these methods , one can use the formalism described in this paper to derive , e.g. , the lens mass probability function .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we introduce our notation for the microlensing and pixel - lensing regime in   [ sec.definitions ] .",
    "we also describe the treatment of finite source effects and how to extract the observables from the light curves . in   [ sec.prob_lens ]",
    "we combine the probability distributions for location , mass , source - lens velocity and impact parameter distribution to obtain the lensing event rate distribution as a function of these parameters .",
    "section  [ sec.source_dis ] summarizes the statistical properties of the source populations , i.e. , luminosity function , number density , color - magnitude and luminosity - radius relation . in   [ sec.app ] we calculate the optical depth and the observables in the microlensing regime : single - star event rate , amplification distribution of the events , einstein timescale distribution , and fwhm distribution of the events .",
    "section  [ sec.app_source ] deals with the pixel - lensing regime .",
    "we calculate the event rate as a function of the maximum excess flux and fwhm time ( and color ) of the event in the point - source approximation .",
    "we also show how the event rate changes , if source sizes ( shifting events to larger timescales and smaller flux excesses ) are taken into account . in   [ sec.exp ] we obtain the event rate for pixel - lensing surveys with spatially varying photon noise ( related to the surface brightness contours of m31 ) but fixed signal - to - noise threshold for the excess flux at maximum magnification .",
    "we predict the number of halo- and self - lensing events in the wecapp survey ( without taking into account the sampling efficiency of the survey ) for the m31 model presented in   [ app.model ] .",
    "we demonstrate that accounting for the minimum fwhm of the events is extremely important to correctly predict the number of events and the luminosity distribution of the lensed sources .",
    "we also compare the characteristics of self - lensing events with halo - lensing events . finally",
    "  [ sec.massprob ] derives the lens mass probability distribution from the observables and errors as obtained from light curve fits .",

    "then the star can not be resolved anymore and the rms error of the baseline of the light curve becomes proportional @xmath76 .",
    "the ( minimum ) systematic error is given by the fact that the subtracted reference image ( with error @xmath77 ) is a sum of ( high - quality ) images , potentially including some of the amplified phases of the sources .",

    "we address the important question , how to extract the source flux @xmath1 from a lensing light curve .",
    "there are four potential ways to constrain the flux of the lensed star :    1 .",
    "the lensed star is resolved and isolated , and therefore a bias in the flux measurement ( by crowding ) can be excluded ( assuming no systematic effects in the baseline ) .",
    "one would of course call such an event a classical microlensing event .",
    "a microlensing fit ( using @xmath87 analysis methods ) to the light curve then directly provides @xmath1 and its probability distribution , ideally given by an gaussian error @xmath88 . in this case the flux measurement error is directly correlated to @xmath89 , the signal - to - noise ratio at maximum magnification . , where @xmath90 is the number of the light curve data points .",
    "] 2 .   the flux @xmath1 is obtained through the information that is in the shape of the wings of the difference light curve @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath87 analysis leads to a probability distribution for @xmath1 .",
    "this flux estimate method is used if no alternative unbiased flux measurement is available , i.e. , cases in which the source star is resolved but blended ( see for applications in the microlensing regime ) , and cases in which the source star is not resolved ( usually called a pixel - lensing event ) . note that other methods using the shape of the wings @xcite provide similar results .",
    "the flux @xmath1 is obtained from an additional , direct measurement , e.g. , low - noise , high spatial resolution photometry from space .",
    "the flux @xmath1 is constrained by theory through plausible distribution functions , e.g. , the luminosity function @xmath92 , the color - magnitude relation of stars , and the distance distribution of stars , which together yield the source flux distribution function ( see   [ sec.masstfwhmdf ] ) .",
    "another constraining example is an upper source flux limit that can be obtained from the fact that the source star is not resolved in the absence of lensing .",
    "since the physical processes are the same in pixel - lensing and microlensing , microlensing is a special case of pixel - lensing , where the source flux probability distribution is much more narrow than the stellar luminosity function , i.e. , the distribution function used in the pixel - lensing regime .",
    "the methods only differ in how to analyze a light curve and how to derive the probability distribution for the source flux .      in this section",
    "we use the distribution of @xmath1 ( from measurement or theory ; see previous section ) to estimate the probability distribution for a value of @xmath18 . note that transforming the distribution of @xmath1 to a distribution of @xmath18 can lead to a different value compared to a @xmath18 obtained directly from the best estimate for @xmath1 .    as the fitting process in the light curve analysis yields the non degenerate observables @xmath28 and @xmath67",

    "are relevant ( we assume velocities to be constant ) . for parallax microlensing events @xcite the nonuniform velocity of the observer changes the observed light curves , since the observer s reference frame is not fixed . however , this effect is unimportant for extragalactic microlensing events .",
    "therefore , in addition to @xmath11 and @xmath12 only the projected relative transversal positions @xmath99 and velocities @xmath100 and the angle @xmath101 enclosed by relative position and velocity vector enter the lensing properties . the distributions in @xmath102 and @xmath101 can be reduced to the distribution of one parameter , the impact parameter @xmath7 of the lens - source trajectory .",

    "we use ( for the motivation , see   [ standard_vs_newdef ] ) an alternative event definition : a lens - source configuration becomes an event , if the lensing light curve reaches the maximum within the survey time @xmath130 .",

    "we will call events characterized by the signal - to - noise ratio at maximum light `` peak - threshold - events '' in the following @xcite . considering only the maximum flux excess of an event ( and not its timescale ) of course can lead to an over - prediction of lensing events , since events might be too fast to be detected . in addition",
    ", long timescale events with low excess flux can have many data points with low significance for the excess flux , which all together make a significant lensing candidate .",
    "the detectability of events therefore depends on both its amplitude ( flux excess at maximum ) and its timescale .",
    "this is the reason , why we derived the contribution to the event rate as a function of flux excess and fwhm timescale in   [ sec.app_source ] .    the flux excess threshold that a source with intrinsic flux @xmath377 must achieve in order to be identified as an event can be translated to thresholds in maximum magnification and relative impact parameter using equations ( [ eq.lc_diff ] ) and ( [ eq.u0_a0 ] ) : @xmath378 @xmath379 in both cases we have also given the high - magnification approximations in the last step .",
