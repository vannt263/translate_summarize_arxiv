    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     observations show a variety of photometric variability in cttss ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in some stars , clear periodic light - curves",
    "are observed , while in others , the light curves appear stochastic ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the variability in x - ray are mostly stochastic , in some cases , signs of rotational modulation are found in soft x - ray emission in cttss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the well - ordered and periodic light curves are likely connected with rotation of hot spots resulting from ordered magnetospheric accretion streams ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or from cold spots which represent regions of strong magnetic field .",
    "the exact origin of the stochastic variability is not well known , and there may be different causes .",
    "it was earlier suggested that stars with ordered light - curves are accreting in a stable regime while stars with stochastic light curves are in the unstable regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "examples of periodic light curves can be found in e.g. @xcite and @xcite . using the convection rotation and planetary transits ( _ corot _ ) satellite ,",
    "@xcite have shown that about 34  per  cent of cttss in the young stellar cluster ngc  2264 display clearly periodic light curves with one or two maxima per stellar rotation ( see panels  a and b in their fig .  1 ) .",
    "our model light curve from the stable accretion regime ( fig .  [ spots - stable - unstable ] ) is very similar to the periodic light curves with two maxima per rotation . as in the observation ,",
    "the smaller and larger maxima alternately appear .",
    "the periodic light curves with one maximum are also consistent with a stable accretion observed with a lower inclination angle system ( e.g.  figure  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "examples of irregular light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ light - curve - obs ] .",
    "the figure shows the light curve of tw hya obtained with the microvariability & oscillations of stars ( _ most _ ) satellite presented in @xcite and the _ corot _ light curve of a ctts in ngc  2264 presented in @xcite .",
    "irregular light curves are found in about 39  per  cent of the cttss sample in @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds no clear periodicity in the light curve for tw  hya in fig .",
    "[ light - curve - obs ] .",
    "however , they determined an approximate period of 3.7  d based on the light curve in an earlier epoch which showed some periodic behaviour . using the 3.7  d period",
    ", one can see that there are a few to several maxima per rotation in the light curve for tw  hya in fig .",
    "[ light - curve - obs ] .",
    "interestingly , our model light curve for the unstable accretion regime ( fig .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] ) also shows a few to several maxima per rotation .",
    "similarly no clear period is found in the light curve of @xcite in fig .",
    "[ light - curve - obs ] ; however , the pattern of the variability resembles that of our model from the unstable accretion regime ( fig .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] ) .",
    "further , the variability amplitudes of the irregular light curves in fig .",
    "[ light - curve - obs ] are also comparable to the model in the unstable regime ( figs .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] and [ variability - all ] ) .    in summary , we confirm that the periodic light curves found in the observations are consistent with a scenario in which the continuum variability are caused by the rotation of two hot spots which are naturally formed in a stable accretion regime with a tilted dipole magnetosphere .",
    "although not included in our model , the presence of stable cold spots on a stellar surface would also produce a periodic light curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the irregular light curves found in observations are consistent with a scenario in which the continuum variability are caused by the rotation of stochastically forming hot spots which naturally occurs in the unstable regime .",
    "yet the third type of the light curve ( aa tau - like ) , in which the variability is partially caused by the occultation of a stellar surface by an accretion ` disc wall ' or a warp near the disc truncation radius ( e.g.  @xcite ) , is not considered in this paper .",
    "in general , the light curves and line ew variability behaviours are expected to be similar among the mhd models which clearly show stable and ordered accretion flows .",
    "the stable accretion funnels will always form smooth and periodic light curves and line variability . on the other hand , light curves and line variability behaviour for",
    "the unstable regimes will be slightly different , depending on the strength of the instability .",
    "in earlier models , ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , we have found that the number of unstable accretion filaments or ` tongues ' present at a given moment of time decreases from several to just one or two as the instability changes from a strong regime to a weak regime . while the number of tongues may change for different model parameters , the occurrences of the unstable tongues are still non - periodic .",
    "therefore , the corresponding light curves and line variability will also remain non - periodic , similar to those seen in the unstable model in this paper ( fig .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] ) .",
    "however , the frequency of the peaks in the light curves and line ew curves per stellar rotation will decrease when the instability becomes weaker .",
    "such variations are expected during the transition from a strongly unstable regime to a stable regime .",
    "the strength of the instability depends on some mhd model parameters such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 in table  [ tab : refval ] . in the following",
    "we briefly discuss the dependency of our model on these key model parameters that can influence the stability of the accretion flows .",
    "_ dependency on @xmath3 and @xmath4_. these are essentially the same model parameters since the corotation radius ( @xmath4 ) is determined by the stellar rotation period @xmath3 for a given stellar mass ( @xmath7 ) , i.e.  @xmath8 .",
    "the unstable flows occur more easily when the effective gravity ( including the effect of the centrifugal force ) is stronger at the inner rim of the accretion disc ( e.g. @xcite ) . a slower stellar rotation or equivalently a larger @xmath4 will increase the effective gravity ; hence",
    ", it tends to enhance the instability .",
    "the effective gravity becomes negative at the disc - magnetosphere boundary when @xmath4 becomes larger than the truncation ( magnetospheric ) radius @xmath9 ( where the matter stress in the disc becomes comparable with the magnetic stress in the magnetosphere ) .",
    "hence , in this simplified approach , accretion flows are expected to become unstable when @xmath10 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the onset of instability depends on a few other factors , such as the level of differential rotation in the inner disc , and also on the gradient of the ratio between the disc surface density and magnetic flux ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the condition , @xmath10 , is necessary for the onset of instability , but it may not be sufficient .",
    "in general , we find the instability is strong in our mhd simulations when stars are rotating relatively slowly i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , we have chosen a larger @xmath3 for the unstable case and a smaller @xmath3 for the stable case in this paper .",
    "_ dependency on @xmath5_. the instability can occur at different misalignment angles of the dipole @xmath5 .",
    "however , at a large @xmath5 ( when the dipole is strongly tilted ) , the accretion flow becomes more stable because the magnetic poles are closer to the inner rim of the disc .",
    "the potential barrier in the vertical direction that the gas at the inner rim of the disc has to overcome to form the stable funnel accretion flow is reduced at a high @xmath5 angle ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath5 becomes small , the potential barrier to overcome becomes higher , and the stable accretion funnels can not be formed so easily . in this case",
    ", the gas accumulates at the inner rim of the disc , and the accretion on to the star proceeds through instability ` tongues ' which penetrate through the magnetosphere . in our mhd simulations , we find that a strong instability occurs when @xmath12 ( @xcite ) . therefore , in this paper , we have chosen the large tilt angle @xmath13 to demonstrate the accretion in the stable case , and the small tilt angle @xmath14 in the unstable case .",
    "_ dependency on @xmath6_. we use the viscosity parameter ( @xmath6 ) to control the global mass - accretion rate .",
    "the initial density conditions for the disc are common in all of our models , including the ones presented in the past ( e.g.  @xcite ) . the higher the value of @xmath6 , the higher the mass - accretion rate becomes . at a higher accretion rate , the inner edge of the disc moves closer to the star .",
    "consequently the ratio @xmath15 becomes smaller , and the condition becomes more favourable for the instability .",
    "the compression of gas near the magnetosphere ( the enhanced surface density per unit magnetic flux ) may also play a role .",
    "the possible artifacts of the @xmath6 viscosity on the formation of instability have been studied in a few experiments . for example , we start from a stable case with a small viscosity ( @xmath16 ) , which is used for the stable case as in table  [ tab : refval ] , and we increase the initial density in the disc by a factor of 2 . in this case , we have observed that the accretion becomes unstable ( @xcite ) . in another experiment ,",
    "we start from a relatively small viscosity ( @xmath17 ) , and increase the period of the star @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", we find the accretion becomes strongly unstable ( e.g.  see fig .  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in our recent simulations with the grid resolutions twice of those in the simulations presented in this paper ( i.e.  @xmath18 ) but with a smaller viscosity ( @xmath16 ) , we find the accretions flow also become unstable , if a star rotates relatively slowly ( e.g.  see fig .  17 in @xcite ) .",
    "based on these experiments , we conclude that a large @xmath6 is not a necessary condition for the instability . for the mhd simulations presented in this paper , we have used @xmath19 in the unstable case and @xmath16 in the stable case for the consistency with earlier simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have investigated observational properties of cttss accreting in the stable and unstable regimes using ( a )  3d mhd simulations to model matter flows , and ( b )  3d radiative transfer models to calculate time - series hydrogen line profiles and continuum emissions . in modelling line profiles , we have introduced the parameterized temperature structures of @xcite in the accretion flow ( section  [ sub : mhd - rad : rad ] ) and a fixed hot spot temperature ( section  [ sec : results : continuum ] ) in order to match the predicted line strengths and the amplitudes of light curves more closely to observations .",
    "our approach is to introduce minimal modifications to the mhd solutions to obtain reasonable line profiles and light curves .",
    "although this is not completely consistent with the mhd solutions , we still retain the flow geometry , density and velocity information from the mhd simulations . to implement proper heating / cooling mechanisms in the flows and more realistic hot spots , we need to develop proper physical models for them , which we have not done yet .    in this work ,",
    "we have focused on the variability in the time scale comparable with or less than a rotational period . for the unstable accretion model",
    ", we have considered the flows associated with the rayleigh - taylor instability that occurs at the interfaces between the accretion disc and stellar magnetosphere . in particular , we have analyzed qualitative behaviours of the variability in the redshifted absorption component in h@xmath2 and the continuum flux to find key observational signatures that can distinguish cttss accreting in the two different regimes ( stable and unstable ) .",
    "our main findings are summarized in the following :    ( 1 )  in the stable regime , the emission lines vary smoothly ( fig .",
    "[ stable-14 ] ) , and their line ew show one or two peaks per stellar rotation period ( fig .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] ) . in the unstable regime ,",
    "the ew of spectral lines vary irregularly and more frequently  showing several maxima per stellar rotation period ( fig .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] ) .",
    "( 2 )  in the stable regime , the redshifted absorption is observed during approximately one half of the rotation period ( when one of two accretion streams is located in front of an observer ) , and is absent during another half of the period ( fig .",
    "[ stable-14 ] ) . in the unstable regime ,",
    "the redshifted absorption is observed at most of the rotational phases due to the presence of several unstable tongues / accretion streams which frequently move into the line of sight of an observer to the stellar surface ( fig .",
    "[ unstable-14 ] ) .",
    "( 3 )  in the stable regime , the continuum emission from hot spots ( the light - curve ) varies smoothly , and it has two peaks per stellar rotation period ( fig .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] ) . in the unstable regime",
    ", the light - curve shows irregular variability with several peaks per period corresponding to several unstable tongues ( fig .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] ) .",
    "we find that the redshifted absorption components are in general more visible in the higher balmer series , e.g. in h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 ( see figs .  [ app - spectra-1 ] and [ app - spectra-2 ] ) and some near - infrared hydrogen lines such as pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 than in the lower balmer lines ( h@xmath6 and h@xmath0 ) .",
    "although the line variability analysis presented here is mainly based on h@xmath2 , similar conclusions can be reached if we use the other redshifted absorption sensitive lines mentioned above .",
    "in addition to these hydrogen lines , he@xmath20  @xmath2110830 may be also useful for probing the accretion stream geometry of cttss , as demonstrated by @xcite .    the work presented here may help to differentiate possible mechanisms of variability .",
    "since the irregular light curves found in many cttss can be connected with different physical processes ( e.g.  magnetic flares , an accretion from a turbulent disc , an accretion through an instability ) , the additional information from a line profile variability analysis may help to disentangle the different processes .",
    "for example , magnetic flares are not relevant to an accretion process ; hence , no correlation is expected between a light curve and a redshifted absorption ( which characterizes the magnetospheric flows ) .",
    "if a light curve is irregular and the redshifted absorption is persistent and non - periodic , the system may be accreting through an instability , which can occur either from a laminar , or from a turbulent disc . on the other hand ,",
    "if a light curve is irregular and the redshifted absorption is periodic ( seen only during a part of a rotational phase ) , the system may be accreting through well - defined accretion funnels originating from a turbulent disc , which provides turbulent cells to the accretion funnels and consequently produces an irregular light curve .",
    "we have investigated only the case of a strong instability in which most of the matter accretes in the unstable equatorial tongues . however , in reality , many cttss may be in a moderately unstable accretion regime ( e.g.  @xcite ) in which both ordered funnel flows and chaotic tongues are present . in these cases , both a persistent redshifted absorption component associated with the unstable accretion tongues , and ordered variability pattern associated with the stable accretion streams can be present simultaneously . however ,",
    "if the two ordered accretion streams from the stable flow components dominate , one can expect only one redshifted absorption per stellar rotation period as seen in the current work ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ stable-14 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , a recent study by @xcite has shown that the unstable flows can be more ordered and corotate with the inner disc when the size of magnetosphere is small and comparable with the radius of the star .",
    "they have also shown that the formation of unstable tongues can be driven by the density waves formed in the inner disc region and by the interaction of the inner disc with the tilted magnetic dipole field of the star @xcite .",
    "although we have concentrated on the line variability associated with the magnetospheric accretion , some line variability could be also attributed to a variable nature of the wind .",
    "the winds from the disc - magnetosphere boundary ( e.g.  @xcite ) are usually associated with episodic inflations and openings of the field lines connecting the magnetosphere and the disc on a time - scale of a few inner disc rotations @xcite .",
    "if the line emission from a wind ( either stellar or disc ) is not significant , a variable wind would cause a variability mainly in the blueshifted absorption component .",
    "however , the emission from the wind could contribute non - negligibly to a total line emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if this is so , it makes the interpretation of a line variability a harder problem . on the other hand ,",
    "some near - infrared hydrogen lines e.g.  pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 , which show relatively strong redshifted absorption in our models ( fig  [ app - spectra-2 ] ) , are usually not affected by the winds ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; therefore , the diagnostic tools presented in this paper are still valid . in addition",
    ", the main time - scale of variability associated with winds is expected to be longer than that of the magnetospheric accretion considered in this paper .",

    "in the main text of the paper , we have used the subsets of h@xmath2 model profiles and the continuum flux near h@xmath2 to demonstrate the key observable differences between accretion in the stable and unstable regimes . in this section ,",
    "we present ( 1 )  the time - series profiles of additional hydrogen lines , i.e.  h@xmath6 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 in the rotational phase ( @xmath22 ) between @xmath23 and @xmath24 with the interval @xmath25 ( figs .",
    "[ app - spectra-1 ] and [ app - spectra-2 ] ) and ( 2 )  the line ew variability curves for the same additional lines as in ( 1 ) , but for three rotational phases ( between @xmath26 and 2.96 ) with the interval @xmath27 ( fig .  [ variability - all ] ) .",
    "the variability curves of the continuum flux ( light curves ) at each line frequency are also shown in the same figure .    in fig .",
    "[ app - spectra-1 ] , h@xmath6 line profiles for both stable and unstable regimes show relatively small variability . no redshifted absorption component is seen in both cases .",
    "this is mainly because h@xmath6 line emission occurs in a wider region in the accretion stream , not just near the base of the accretion stream ( near the stellar surface ) , and the strong emission in the line wings due to line broadening effects ( e.g.  the stark broadening , @xcite ) .",
    "the model profiles for h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 show a very weak redshifted absorption component ( below the continuum level ) in both stable and unstable regimes at some rotational phases .",
    "since the absorption component in these lines are very weak , they are not suitable for studying the differences between the stable and unstable regimes . although not shown here , the redshifted absorption in these lines becomes more visible if the accretion funnel gas temperature is decreased slightly .",
    "the redshifted absorption components are much more prominent in h@xmath2 ( in optical ) , pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 ( in near - infrared ) as one can see in fig .",
    "[ app - spectra-2 ] , for both stable and unstable cases . for the stable accretion case , the redshifted absorption component is visible in these lines during about a half of a rotational phase ( between @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "these phases approximately coincide with the phases when the upper accretion funnel stream is in front of the star ( see fig .  [ stable-14 ] ) , i.e.when the upper accretion funnel is in the line of sight of the observer to the stellar surface . a weak double - peak feature visible in pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 in the latter half of the rotational phase ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 )",
    "is mainly caused by the ` lack of emission ' from the gas moving at zero project velocity toward an observer .",
    "this is due to the geometrical effect ( two distinct accretion streams ) and the fact that the emission in pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 occurs near the base of accretion stream where the flow velocity is large ( @xmath32 ) . at some phases , the gas at the inner edge of the accretion disc could also intersect",
    "the line of sight between the observer and the system , and causes a small amount of absorption near the line centre since the intervening gas in the inner most part of the accretion disc is just rotating with a keplerian velocity ; hence , its projected velocity toward the observer would be around zero .",
    "this can also contribute to the double peaked appearances of pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 .",
    "for the unstable case , the redshifted absorption component in h@xmath2 , pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 is present at almost all phases .",
    "this is due to the geometry of the accretion flows ( see fig .",
    "[ unstable-14 ] ) .",
    "the instability causes a few to several accretion streams to be present in the system at all times .",
    "hence , at least one of the accretion streams or tongues is almost always in the line of sight of the observer to the stellar surface , and producing the redshifted absorption component .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ variability - all ] , we summarize the light curves ( monochromatic ) computed at the frequencies around h@xmath6 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 along with their line ews as a function of rotational phase ( for three rotational phases ) for both stable and unstable cases . note that the plots for h@xmath2 are not shown here because they have been already shown in fig .",
    "[ spots - stable - unstable ] in the main text ( section  [ sec : results : continuum ] ) .",
    "while the light curves are very periodic for the stable case , they are quite irregular / stochastic for the unstable case . in the stable case ,",
    "the light curves clearly show two maxima per period ( except for the case in br@xmath1 ) .",
    "these are caused by the rotation of the two hot spots on the stellar surface created by the two accretion streams ( see figs .  [ stable-14 ] and [ spots - stable - unstable ] ) . the line ew variablity curves are also influenced by the presence of hot spots since they contribute significantly to the total continuum flux . however , in the light curve of br@xmath1 for the stable case , the relative amplitudes are rather small and it is more difficult to see the maxima .",
    "the smaller amplitudes are seen because the relative flux contribution of the hot spot ( assumed 8000@xmath33 and @xmath34  per  cent surface coverage ) to the total continuum flux is much smaller at the wavelength of br@xmath1 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the accretion streams on to the stellar surface and the hot spots are formed rather stochastically in the unstable cases , resulting in the irregular light curves .",
