    "lieb and seiringer  @xcite proved that the bmv conjecture is equivalent to the following reformulation : for every @xmath1 and @xmath2 as above , all of the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath18\\ ] ] are nonnegative .",
    "recently , there has been much activity around this algebraic reformulation , ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the latest state of knowledge is summarized in  @xcite , and we ll review this here .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the sum of all words of length @xmath3 in @xmath1 and @xmath2 having @xmath4 letters equal to @xmath2 and @xmath19 equal to @xmath1 .",

    "an important result , due to hillar  @xcite , is that if this conjecture fails for some @xmath22 , then it fails for all @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we ll refer to this as hillar s descent theorem .",
    "one strategy that has been used to show that the trace of @xmath0 is nonnegative for certain values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is to let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be formal square roots of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively and , working in the algebra @xmath5 of polynomials in noncommuting variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 , to show that @xmath0 is equal to a sum of commutators @xmath28=gh - hg$ ] and hermitian squares @xmath29 . here , the algebra @xmath5 is endowed with the involutive @xmath30operation that is anti  multiplicative and so that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are hermitian .",

    "it was hoped that proofs of @xmath50 for other values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 would be posible , so as to prove the conjecture for more values of @xmath3 , and possibly even to prove the bmv conjecture itself .",
    "these results left open the cases @xmath9 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 with both @xmath3 and @xmath4 even . in this paper ( see section  [ sec : nonsos ] ) , we prove @xmath58 whenever @xmath3 and @xmath4 are even and @xmath8 . using @xmath65 ,",

    "the case of @xmath10 remains open , though , as indicated in  @xcite , numerical evidence seems to suggest it does not lie in @xmath46 .",
    "our results , thus , show that it is impossible to prove the bmv conjecture by showing that @xmath0 is cyclically equivalent to a sum of hermitian squares for sufficiently many values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however there are other plausible approaches to showing @xmath11 must always hold .    though our proofs are straightforward and easy to check by hand , to find them we calculated with mathematica 7.0 @xcite , on an apple macbook running os x version 10.4.11 .    while exploring , we found ( see proposition  [ prop : s4m+2,4 ] ) that if @xmath3 is even and is not a multiple of @xmath14 , then @xmath12 is equal to a sum of commutators and hermitian squares in @xmath13",

    ".    we will prove the following theorem in section  [ sec : lagrangemult ] .",

    "we also show ( proposition  [ prop : s84 ] ) that @xmath71 is not cyclically equivalent to a sum of hermitian squares in @xmath13 .",
    "this makes the case @xmath72 of particular interest for question  [ ques : h ] .",
    "our interest in question  [ ques : h ] has two motivations .",
    "one is its relation to the bmv conjecture .",
    "although the question is known to be stronger than the bmv conjecture and we have no particular reason to think it will be easier to prove than the bmv conjecture itself , it is clearly related to the bmv conjecture and it may be helpful to explore it .",
    "a second motivation is the relation to connes embedding problem . for positive semidefinite matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the trace of @xmath73 is always nonnegative , though it is not cyclically equivalent to a sum of squares in @xmath49 ; as was pointed out in  @xcite , this makes @xmath73 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 positive operators in a ii@xmath74factor , an interesting test case for connes embedding problem . in a similar way ,",
    "if question  [ ques : h ] turns out to have a positive answer for @xmath71 , then because of proposition  [ prop : s84 ] , then it will provide another interesting test case for connes embedding problem , involving self ",
    "adjoint operators .",
    "at this point , it seems important to generate such test cases .",
    "after a first version of this paper was circulated , we learned that s.  burgdorf ( see remarks  ( b ) and  ( c ) of section  4 of  @xcite ) had , long previously to us , also found that if @xmath3 is not a multiple of @xmath14 , then @xmath12 is cyclically equivalent to a sum of hermitian squares in @xmath13 ; no proof was given in  @xcite .",
