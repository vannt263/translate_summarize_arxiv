    "this observation can be interpreted in two ways : + ( a ) the choice of gauge group is restricted to @xmath41 in the fundamental , anti - fundamental or adjoint representation ; or + ( b ) the gauge fields are valued in the enveloping algebra of a lie algebra and then any ( unitary ) representation is possible .",
    "+ the case ( a ) applies also to the @xmath42 case and imposes severe restrictions on the allowed charges ; it has been studied carefully and has led to `` theorems ''  @xcite .",
    "the second case avoids the restrictions on the gauge group and choice of representation , but needs to address the potential problem of too many degrees of freedom , since all coefficient functions of the monomials in the generators could a priori be physical fields .",
    "the solution to this problem is that the coefficient fields are not all independent .",
    "they are rather functions of the correct number of ordinary gauge fields via seiberg - witten maps and their generalizations .",

    "it was shown mathematically rigorously that any u(1 ) gauge theory on an arbitrary poisson manifold can be deformation - quantized to a noncommutative gauge theory via the the enveloping algebra approach  @xcite and later extended to the non - abelian gauge groups  @xcite .",

    "we see that both solutions are real and positive . taking into account the higher order ( in y ) correction",
    "these poles will locate nearby the real axis of the complex @xmath136 plane thus correspond to some metastable modes with the above defined dispersion relations .",
    "as we can see , the modified dispersion relation does not depend on the noncommutative scale , therefore it introduces a discontinuity in the @xmath137 limit , which is not unfamiliar in noncommutative theories .      at @xmath139",
    "we analyze the asymptotic behavior of @xmath140 from @xcite , therefore can be reduced to @xmath141 we thus reach two unstable deformed modes besides the usual mode @xmath117 in the high energy regime . here again the leading order deformed dispersion relation does not depend on the noncommutative scale @xmath3 .      using the feynman rule of the alternative action ( 2.15 ) from ref @xcite , which is a consequence of the sw freedom , we find the following contribution to the neutrino self - energy from diagram @xmath87 @xmath142 the detailed computation is presented in appendix b of ref .",
    "we notice that there are no hard @xmath96 uv divergent and no logarithmic uv / ir mixing terms , and the finite terms like in @xmath143 and @xmath102 are also absent .",
    "thus the subgraph @xmath87 for the alternative action ( 2.15 ) in @xcite does not require any counter - term .",
    "however , the result ( [ a9 ] ) , does express powerful uv / ir mixing effect , that is in terms of scales terms , the @xmath144 experience the forth - power of the _ nc - scale / momentum - scale _ ratios @xmath145 in ( [ a9 ] ) , i.e. we are dealing with the @xmath146 within the ultraviolet and infrared limits for @xmath3 and @xmath115 , respectively .",

    "coupling is chiral blind and it vanishes in the commutative limit . the non-@xmath152-proportional term ,",

    "@xmath174 to @xmath175 gev , where there is always energy of the system @xmath176 larger than the nc scale @xmath177 , the perturbative expansion in terms of @xmath3 retains no longer its meaningful character , thus it is forcing us to resort to those nc field - theoretical frameworks involving the full @xmath0-resummation .",
    "our numerical estimates of the contribution to the processes coming from the photon exchange , pins impeccably down a lower bound on @xmath3 to be as high as around up to @xmath178 gev , depending on the cosmogenic @xmath16-flux .",
    "for above analysis it was necessary to use results of @xcite which shows explicitly that the `` no - go theorem ''",
    "@xcite is certainly not applicable to our sw - map based @xmath0-exact models of the ncgft .",
    "namely , it is known to be impossible in noncommutative geometry to directly form tensor products from the nc fields as long as there is no additional underlaying mathematical structure .",
    "the sw - map based models do however have an additional underlying mathematical structure : they can be understood as the deformation quantization of ordinary fiber bundles over a poisson manifold . with this additional structure ,",
    "tensor products are possible and survive the quantization procedure  @xcite . however , the authors in @xcite failed to directly form tensor products of noncommutative fields .",
    "the proof of this failure is given in @xcite .",
    "now we first discuss @xmath0-exact computation of the one - loop quantum correction to the @xmath16-propagator .",
    "we in particular evaluate the neutrino two - point function , and demonstrate how quantum effects in the @xmath0-exact sw map approach to ncgft s , together with a combination of schwinger , feynman , and hqet parameterization , reveal a much richer structure yielding the one - loop quantum correction in a closed form .",
    "general expression for the neutrino self - energy ( [ sigma1ab ] ) contains in ( [ a1 ] ) both a hard @xmath96 uv term and the uv / ir mixing term with a logarithmic infrared singularity @xmath179 .",
    "results shows complete decoupling of the uv divergent term from softened uv / ir mixing term and from the finite terms as well .",
    "our deformed dispersion relations at both the low and high energies and at the leading order do not depend on the noncommutative scale @xmath3 .",
    "the low energy dispersion relation is , in principle , capable of generating a direction dependent superluminal velocity , this can be seen clearly from the maximal attainable velocity of the neutrinos @xmath180 where @xmath163 is the angle with respect to the direction perpendicular to the nc plane .",
    "this gives one more example how such spontaneous @xmath0-background breaking of lorentz symmetry could affect the particle kinematics through quantum corrections , even without divergent behavior like uv / ir mixing .",
    "on the other hand one can also see that the magnitude of superluminosity is in general very large in our model as a quantum effect , thus seems contradicting various observations which suggests much smaller values @xcite . on the other hand , note",
    "that the large superluminal velocity issue may also be reduced / removed by taking into account several considerations and/or properties : + ( 1 . )",
    "selection of a constant nonzero @xmath0 background in this paper is due to the computational simplicity .",
    "the results will , however , still hold for a nc background that is varying sufficiently slowly with respect to the scale of noncommutativity .",
    "there is no physics reason to expect @xmath0 to be a globally constant background _",
    "ether_. in fact , if the @xmath0 background is only nonzero in tiny regions ( nc bubbles ) the effects of the modified dispersion relation will be suppressed macroscopically .",
    "certainly a better understanding of possible sources of nc is needed .",
    "we have considered only the purely noncommutative neutrino - photon coupling .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that modified neutrino dispersion relation could open decay channels within the commutative standard model framework @xcite . in our case",
    "this would further provide decay channel(s ) which can bring superluminal neutrinos to normal ones .",
    "note that the model 1 is not the only allowed deformed model with noncommutative neutrino - photon coupling . and",
    "as we have shown for our model 2 , there could be no modified dispersion relation(s ) for deformation(s ) other than 1 , therefore it is reasonable to conjecture that seiberg - witten map freedom may also serve as one possible remedy to this issue .",
    "our results differs with respect to @xcite since in our case both terms are proportional to the spacetime noncommutativity dependent @xmath0-ratio ( the scale - independent structure ! ) factor in ( [ degen1 ] ) , which arise from the natural non - locality of our actions . besides the divergent terms",
    ", a new spinor structure @xmath181 with finite coefficients emerges in our computation , see ( [ sigma1ab])-([a2 ] ) .",
    "all these structures are proportional to @xmath134 , therefore if appropriate renormalization conditions are imposed , the commutative dispersion relation @xmath117 can still hold , as a part of the full set of solutions obtained in ( 23 ) . + ( 5 . ) finally , we mention that our approach to uv / ir mixing should not be confused with the one based on a theory with uv completion ( @xmath182 ) , where a theory becomes an effective qft , and the uv / ir mixing manifests itself via a specific relationship between the uv and the ir cutoffs @xcite .    from the same actions ( [ sgauge ] , [ sfermion ] ) , but for three different cosmological laboratories , that is from uhe cosmic ray neutrino scatterings on nuclei @xcite , from the bbn and from the rpai @xcite , we obtain very similar , a quite strong bounds on the nc scale , of the order of @xmath183 gev . note in particular that all results depicted in figs.[fig : ncsm - crosssections]-[fig : lambdavst ] , and [ fig : z2nubarnunc ] show closed - convergent forms .",
    "all above summarized properties are previously unknown features of @xmath0-exact nc gauge field theory .",
    "they appear in the model with the action presented in section  4 . the alternative action , and the corresponding @xmath16-self - energy ( [ a9 ] ) , has less striking features , but it does have it s own advantages due to the absence of a hard uv divergences , and the absence of complicated finite terms .",
    "the structure in ( [ a9 ] ) is different ( it is _ nc - scale / energy _ dependent ) with respect to the nc scale - independent structure from ( [ degen1 ] ) , as well as to the structure arising from fermion self - energy computation in the case of @xmath9-product only unexpanded theories @xcite .",
    "however , ( [ a9 ] ) does posses powerful uv / ir mixing effect .",
    "this is fortunate with regard to the use of low - energy ncqft as an important window to holography @xcite and quantum gravity @xcite .",
