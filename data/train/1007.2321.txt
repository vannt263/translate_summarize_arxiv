    "5 it is seen that for @xmath14820 v , which corresponds to the concentration of carriers @xmath149 @xmath125 , the energy flow reaches the values @xmath150w/@xmath125 . in addition , the dependences @xmath67 versus @xmath102 are close to parabolic ones ( see the dashed curves in fig .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath67 is weak ( less than 10% for the @xmath104 increasing from 300 k to 600 k ; pertinent graphs are not shown ) because the spectral dependences are determined by dimensionless parameter @xmath151 .    for the geometry ( b ) the radial component of energy flow in the far - zone eq .",

    "summazing the consideration performed , the examination of luminescence caused by the interband transitions of hot electrons is presented .",
    "it is found , that the universal frequency - independent polarization of emission is realized for a weakly anisotropic distributions of nonequilibrium carriers .",
    "the spectral dependences of radiation are determined by the factor @xmath135 multiplied by the product of electron and hole distributions . these data , together with measurements of the angular dependences and the integral intensity of radiation ( the latter strongly depends on generation - recombination processes ) , allows the effective characterization of hot carriers .",
    "in addition , obtained efficient emission of hot carriers in mid - ir spectral regions opens a possibility for using the electroluminescence of graphene as a source of radiation .",
    "now let us discuss recent experiments on emission by hot carriers from the back - gated transistor structures , subjected to a strong in - plane electric field , @xcite where measured spectral dependences are interpreted by using the planck s law .",
    "for the latter the high frequency asymptotic coincides with the asymptotic of eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) , for the case of the quasiequilibrium fermi distributions . from these spectral dependences in @xcite",
    "it was found the relation of @xmath104 with a power of the joule heating .",
    "however , the character of recombination , that could be determined from the intensity of radiation , was not investigated ; dependences on a size of sample , angular dependences and polarization characteristics of the radiation also need a special treatment .",
    "next , we list and discuss the assumptions used . in the study of interaction of a radiation with the graphene sheet",
    "the only simplification used is the neglect by attenuation of radiation propagated along the layer , so that obtained results are not applicable for @xmath112 .",
    "more rigid constraint is imposed by modeling of the distributions of nonequilibrium carriers via the quasiequilibrium fermi functions , with given effective temperature and concentrations of carriers .",
    "this approximation shows that important information on the mechanisms of energy relaxation and recombination can be obtained from the spectra of luminescence .",
    "however , for more precise calculation of the spectral dependences more realistic distribution functions of carriers will be needed .",
    "further , the spectral and the polarization dependences can be separated only in an approximation of a weak anisotropy of the distribution of carriers .",
    "but such a separation can be broken under a strong enough electric field when an essential anisotropy of the distribution functions appears .",
    "we also have restricted our consideration by the homogeneous geometry ( without taking into account of the edge effects ) and the far - zone region geometry [ approaches ( a ) and ( b ) in figs .",
    "1a and 1b ] , however , the general treatment implies solving of eqs([1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) for a specific geometry that is not well enough approximated by any of these two limit geometries .    to conclude ,",
    "obtained results show that spectral , angular , and polarization dependences of the electroluminescence provide a convenient method of characterization of the hot carriers in graphene ( along with the electrooptical measurements @xcite and a study of the raman scattering @xcite ) .",
    "therefore present results will stimulate subsiquent experiments and their theoretical interpretations designated for a verification of the relaxation mechanisms of nonequilibrium carriers under their heating both for the electric field and for the interband photoexcitation .",
