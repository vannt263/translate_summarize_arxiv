    "the conversion of gas into stars is one of the most fundamental astrophysical processes regulating galaxy evolution , and hence the star formation rate ( sfr ) which measures the rate at which this conversion occurs , building up the stellar mass of the galaxy , is a key observable in galaxy evolution studies . the harsh cluster environment is well known to affect the star formation activity of the member galaxies , as quantified through the star - formation ( sf)density relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while various physical mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping , harassment and starvation have been proposed to quench star formation in infalling spiral galaxies transforming them into the passive lenticulars which dominate cluster cores ( for reviews see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dominant evolutionary pathway(s ) remains unresolved .",
    "many of these processes that drive the evolution of galaxies also shape the luminosity function ( lf ) , one of the most basic and fundamental properties of the galaxy population @xcite .",
    "the lfs of cluster galaxies at various wavelengths can hence provide quantitative probes of how these dense environments affect the fundamental galaxy properties such as the overall mass function , stellar masses and sfrs .",
    "a key question is whether the lf shows a significant environmantal dependence or is instead universal .",
    "this remains unclear , with some studies suggesting relatively little variation with environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while other find sigificant differences including brighter characterisitic luminosities and steeper faint - end slopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could be largely ascribed to the diverse morphological composition of cluster and field populations @xcite .",
    "however the optical luminosities of galaxies depend not only on their stellar masses but are also strongly affected by the presence of young stellar populations and dust , which can bias the optical lfs , making it difficult to reliably interpret the data .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) instead is much less sensitive to the effects of dust or star formation , and hence the nir ( e.g. @xmath10-band ) lf can be considered a reliable estimator of the underlying stellar mass function @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet ( @xmath6000 ) instead provides a measure of the recent sfr over the last @xmath11yr in galaxies , being dominated by emission from young stars of intermediate masses ( 25m@xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence the ultraviolet lf represents a useful tool to quantify the effects of the cluster environment on star formation .",
    "ultraviolet radiation from young stars can be strongly attenuated by the intervening dust , and indeed the ultraviolet emission from spiral galaxies comes predominately from those slightly older stars ( @xmath13yrs ) that have migrated away from their birthplaces in the highly obscured giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the amount of attenuation depends both on the general properties of the galaxy ( mass , metallicity , morphology ) and the relative geometry of the dust and young stars , but for many galaxies more than 90% of the uv photons are absorbed by dust , corresponding to @xmath14 and hence potentially signficantly biasing the ultraviolet lf .",
    "this energy absorbed by the dust is however reprocessed as thermal radiation in the mid / far - infrared ( 81000@xmath4 m ) , and so observations at these wavelengths allow us to quantify this energy and thus infer the amount of obscured star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optically - thin infrared and radio continuum emission provides an inherently extinction - free estimate of sfrs , and so the infrared and radio lfs can be considered complementary to the ultraviolet lfs , being sensitive to obscured emission missed by the ultraviolet lf , and between them provide strong constraints on the global sfrs in cluster galaxies and on the impact of cluster related environmental processes on star formation .",
    "the first pioneering ultraviolet observations of cluster galaxies were performed using the sounding rocket payloads of @xcite .",
    "the foca balloon - borne 40cm - diameter telescope surveyed the local coma and abell 1367 clusters @xcite , obtaining the 2000 ultraviolet luminosity function for coma .",
    "they found that despite coma being the archetype of the elliptical - rich and concentrated cluster , in the ultraviolet it is strongly dominated by spirals , and its surface density shows low concentration and contrast over the field .",
    "@xcite then combined the foca and later faust uv cluster surveys to produce a composite uv luminosity function for the virgo , coma and abell 1367 clusters .",
    "this was found to be well fitted by a schechter function with m@xmath15 and @xmath16 values that did not differ significantly from the local uv luminosity function of the field .",
    "more recent deeper studies of the uv lfs of coma and abell 1367 with _ galex _ showed steeper faint - end slopes than for the field , due to the contribution of passively - evolving galaxies at faint magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ; * ? ? ? * ) provided the first opportunity to study the infrared properties of cluster galaxies and to compare them with the field population . in a pointed _ iras _ survey of the hercules cluster at @xmath17 reaching 50mjy at 60@xmath4 m ( @xmath18 ) , @xcite identified twenty - four 60@xmath4 m sources as spiral galaxies belonging to the cluster , producing a luminosity function that could be fit by a double power law .",
    "notably galaxies classified as ellipticals or s0s were absent from the infrared data . _ iso _ and more recently the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope @xcite have allowed much more sensitive infrared studies of star formation in clusters , revealing ubiquitous obscured star formation among cluster galaxies whose contribution was underestimated by @xmath19 by previous optical studies @xcite . for",

    "galaxies with obscured sfrs of 30100m@xmath21 become commonplace , indicative of rapid evolution , but largely paralleling that evolution found in the field @xcite , consistent with these galaxies representing a recently accreted population @xcite .        in (",
    "* paper i ) we introduced the access multi - wavelength survey of the shapley supercluster core ( ssc ) as well as presented an analysis of the @xmath10-band data .",
    "the target has been chosen since the most dramatic effects of environment on galaxy evolution should occur in superclusters , where the infall and encounter velocities of galaxies are greatest ( @xmath22000kms@xmath23 ) , groups and clusters are still merging , and significant numbers of galaxies will be encountering the dense intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of the supercluster environment for the first time . moreover , the interplay of a variety of physical processes need to be invoked to describe the overdensity of baryons on supercluster scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which emphasises the cosmological context of studies involving the effects of star formation , agn and associated gas processes .",
    "the shapley supercluster was identified as the largest overdensity of galaxies and clusters in the @xmath24 universe in an apm survey of galaxies covering the entire southern sky @xcite and confirmed by early x - ray studies @xcite . in the original abell catalogue @xcite ,",
    "the core of the shapley supercluster was found to be represented by a single cluster ( a3558@xmath25shapley  8) of optical richness  4 , inconsistent with the observed velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "early x - ray observations from _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ @xcite resolved this by discovering that the core in fact comprises of a chain three merging clusters , a3558 , sc1327 - 312 and sc1329 - 313 .",
    "the ssc in this paper refers to these three clusters , along with the two associated abell clusters on either side , a3562 and a3556 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "complete _ and _ unbiased _ census of star formation in galaxies belonging to the ssc using a multi - wavelength analysis combining _ galex _ ultraviolet and _ spitzer _ infrared observations , in order to circumvent any biases that may exist in previous surveys in which star formation rates in cluster galaxies were estimated from a single sfr indicator .",
    "by assembling a comprehensive pan - chromatic ( fuv  fir ) dataset for the ssc we are able to fully account for both obscured and unobscured star - formation , and by dealing with _ global _ photometric measurements , we are independent of the aperture biases @xcite prevalent in many previous studies based on optical spectra obtained from fibre - fed spectrographs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ".    the bulk of these infalling star - forming galaxies can not be interlopers , who happen to have line - of - sight velocities within the redshift range of the cluster , as the normalization of the cluster infrared lf is still @xmath653@xmath174 higher than the local field infrared lfs @xcite multiplied by the total volume occupied by the cluster survey ( @xmath6400mpc@xmath175 ) .",
    "we note that this higher normalization does not imply star formation is being triggered in the supercluster , but simply reflects the overall significant overdensity of galaxies in this volume .",
    "it is difficult to understand why if the field and cluster infrared lfs are consistent , the cluster fuv lf should be significantly steeper than that found in the field , as both reflect the star - formation from the essentially same galaxies .",
    "one possibility is that the differences are only fully apparent at the very low sfrs traced by the galex data , and which are missed by the marginally ( @xmath17623@xmath177 ) shallower 24@xmath4 m data .",
    "alternatively , the skewed fuv lf could reflect environmental processes acting on just dwarf galaxies which are missed by our 24@xmath4 m survey , as their star formation is unobscured and emitted primarily in the fuv .",
    "one small caveat to the apparent agreement between cluster and field infrared lfs over the luminosity range @xmath178 is the observed behaviour of the local field far - infrared lf , which for @xmath179 can no longer be described by a single schecter function . instead of declining exponentially ,",
    "the luminosity function is better described as a power - law @xcite , or via an additional schechter function to model the galaxy counts at @xmath179 .",
    "similarly , the 1.4ghz radio galaxy luminosity function can not be described by a single schechter function , but requires two components , one representing the normal , late - type field galaxies and the other representing `` monsters '' powered by agn @xcite which dominate at @xmath180 .",
    "@xcite thus model the far - infrared lf as a sum of two schechter functions , one for normal field galaxies , and a second to model the high - luminosity excess composed of a starburst / ulirg population in which the sfrs ( and hence fir luminosities ) are temporarily boosted by an order of magnitude .",
    "the apparent ability to fit the cluster far - ir lfs by a single schechter function , could suggest that this second starburst component is missing from clusters .",
    "however , we note that the density of such luminous infrared galaxies in the field is @xmath181 , and given our survey volume of just @xmath182 we would expect to find @xmath183 such galaxy in the ssc .",
    "we have presented new panoramic _",

    "spitzer _ and _ herschel_. from the _ galex _ data we produced near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) luminosity functions , which were found to have steeper faint - end slopes ( @xmath184 ) than the local field population at the @xmath73 level , due largely to the contribution of massive , quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 . using the _ spitzer_/mips 24@xmath4 m imaging , we determined the infrared galaxy lf of the shapley supercluster core , finding it well described by a single schechter function with @xmath185 and @xmath101 , fully consistent with those obtained for the coma cluster and abell 3266 .",
    "we also presented the first 70@xmath4 m galaxy luminosity function of a local cluster with _ spitzer _ , finding it to be consistent with that obtained at 24@xmath4 m .",
    "the shapes of the 24@xmath4 m and 70@xmath4 m galaxy luminosity functions were also found to be indistinguishable from those of the local field population .",
    "this apparent lack of environmental dependence for the shape of the fir luminosity function suggests that the bulk of the star - forming galaxies that make up the observed cluster infrared lf have been recently accreted from the field and have yet to have their star formation activity significantly affected by the cluster environment . combining the _ galex _ fuv and _ spitzer _",
