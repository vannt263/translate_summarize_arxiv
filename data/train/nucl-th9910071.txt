    "nuclear structure properties of light nuclei can be investigated by studying their response to electromagnetic excitations .",
    "one way to adopt this method is the traditional slow and/or fast neutron capture @xmath2-ray emission spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , textbook examples of photo - dissociation processes ( e.g. @xmath3 ) exist showing how the time - reversal reaction channel can also be a corresponding powerful technique .",
    "coulomb excitation processes have been traditionally employed to study the structure properties of nuclear bound states .",
    "more recently , a technique has been developed in which the coulomb excitation process has been extended above the dissociation limit ( namely above some nuclear breakup channel ) .",
    "the use of this technique became particularly attractive with the availability of radioactive ion beams ( ribs ) .",
    "in fact , using ribs this method allows to do spectroscopy of nuclei far from the stability line , up to the drip - lines .",
    "we will present here examples of each one of these techniques just mentioned , with particular emphasis on new developments concerning the traditional approaches as well as with some very recent results obtained with the up - to - date ribs facilities .",
    "for light nuclei , the neutron capture process is often dominated by a direct radiative capture process ( drc ) .",
    "this is a process in which the incident neutron makes a direct transition into one of the bound states of the residual nucleus emitting one or more @xmath2-rays , _ without _ forming any intermediate compound state .",
    "drc models have been formulated in different ways , but with , of course , the same physical contents . to carry on the discussion on the neutron capture as well as on the dissociation processes we need to give here one of these formulation .",
    "we start from the wave functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the continuum and of the bound - state , respectively given by @xmath6^{j_c }   \\times { \\hat \\chi}_{i}]^{j_c}.\\ ] ] and @xmath7^{j_b } \\times { \\hat \\chi}_{i}]^{j_b}\\ ] ] here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are angular and spin components of the wave functions , the spin of the target nucleus is indicated by @xmath10 and all other quantum numbers defining the continuum , bound and core state uniquely are indicated by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the @xmath14 s coefficients are the fractional parentage amplitudes determined by the total number of particles occupying the @xmath15 orbit , @xmath16 . in shell - model standard",
    "notation@xcite they are indicated by @xmath17 and the spectroscopic factor for a given configuration is simply given by @xmath18 .",
    "the radial wave functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are obtained by solving the scattering and the bound state problem respectively , in a given potential .",
    "the matrix elements for electric @xmath21-pole transitions are @xmath22 and may be written as a product of three terms @xmath23 with the electric transition operator @xmath24 and the radial overlap integral defined as @xmath25 the angular - spin coupling coefficient is indicated by @xmath26 and its definition can be found in the reference@xcite .",
    "the capture cross section is given by @xmath27 ^ 2 } \\frac{k_{\\gamma}^{2l+1}}{\\hbar v }   \\frac{1}{2s+1 } \\frac{1}{2i+1 }   \\bar{e}^{2}_{\\rm el }   \\displaystyle\\sum_{l_c j_c , l_b j_b }   \\mid q^{({\\rm el})}_{c \\rightarrow b } \\mid^{2}\\ ] ] where the sum is extended to all components of the the continuum and bound state wave functions compatible with the @xmath28 selection rules .",
    "here , @xmath29 is the photon wave number corresponding to a transition energy @xmath30 and @xmath31 the core - neutron relative velocity in the continuum .",
    "@xmath32 is the single - particle effective charge of the neutron .    in the presence of a resonance state in the vicinity of the continuum energy @xmath33",
    ", the capture cross section contains a breit - wigner and an interference terms , in addition to the drc term just shown @xmath34^{1/2 } \\cos[\\delta_{r}(e)]\\ ] ] with @xmath35 and @xmath36.\\ ] ] here , the resonance energy , the neutron , gamma and total widths are indicated by @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the statistical weight factor is as usual @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath38 is intended to indicate the partial radiative width for a transition leading to a specific bound state .",
    "a nice example of the onset of the resonance and interference terms in the neutron capture cross section is provided by the @xmath41 reaction for energies up to about 1 mev . here",
    ", the well known @xmath42 @xmath43wave resonance at 434 kev , interferes with the smooth drc @xmath43wave component as shown in figure [ fig1 ] . both the capture transitions leading to the @xmath44 ground state and to the @xmath45 first excited state in @xmath46 show typical interference patterns as a function of the incident neutron energy .",
    "the calculation of the drc component was done using the @xmath47 and @xmath48 single - particle wave functions calculated from a woods - saxon potential with standard geometrical parameters @xmath49 fm , @xmath50 fm and @xmath51 mev .",
    "the well depth was adjusted to reproduce the experimental binding energies of the two states ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively for the ground and first excited state ) .",
    "the spectroscopic factors for both the bound states were taken to be unity .",
    "the wave functions for the continuum were calculated using the same potential parameters with a well - depth of @xmath53 mev . with a resonance energy @xmath54 kev and neutron width @xmath55 kev ,",
    "the partial gamma - ray widths necessary to reproduce the experimental data were @xmath56 ev .",
    "no other adjustable parameters were used in the calculation .",
    "the obtained total radiative width was therefore @xmath57 ev , 40% smaller than the bnl compiled value@xcite .",
    "the time - reversal invariance of nuclear reactions provides a relation between the capture and photo - neutron cross section ( detailed balance ) .",
    "in fact , once we define the reaction as    @xmath58{c c c c c c c } n & + &   { } ^{a}{\\rm z } &   \\rightarrow & { } ^{a+1}{\\rm z } & + & \\gamma \\\\ 1 &    &     2            &               &         3         &    &    4     \\\\ \\end{array } $ ]    the relation connecting the direct and inverse processes is simply given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the wavenumber of the @xmath61 relative motion .",
    "an interesting example of photo - dissociation process is given by the @xmath62 reaction .",
    "in fact , its time - reversal process , the neutron capture by @xmath63 , is supposed to play a crucial role in the so - called @xmath13-induced recombination process during the post - collapse phase of a typeii supernova@xcite .",
    "the neutron capture reaction rate can not be measured directly because of the @xmath13-decay of @xmath64 .",
    "however , the photo - dissociation experiment can be performed and , indeed , some data are available . from the nuclear structure point of view , this is an interesting case as the first excited @xmath65 state of @xmath0 , is located just above the neutron separation threshold . in view of the discussion we made above concerning the interference between the drc and the resonance process",
    ", some interesting behavior of the photo - neutron cross section close to threshold can be expected .",
    "the structure properties of the @xmath65 state are also still quite uncertain .",
    "its most obvious property is that it is located below the @xmath66 state .",
    "the lowering of the @xmath48 orbit in light systems ( of which the @xmath65 state is supposed to be mainly composed ) is the subject or recent interesting investigations .",
    "we have performed the calculation of the @xmath67 cross section using a drc model for the bound - to - continuum transition plus resonance and interference contributions .",
    "the results of this calculation is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the parameters and the technique used for the calculation of the drc component are similar to those employed for the calculation of the neutron capture cross section discussed above . here , however , the @xmath68 ground state has a configuration of type .",
    "in addition , in this case we made a shell model calculation using the cohen - kurath residual interaction for the p - shell model space and obtained @xmath69 .",
    "the parameters of the resonance state were taken from the work of barker@xcite .",
    "these were @xmath70 kev , @xmath71 kev and @xmath72 ev . from the results shown in figure [ fig2 ] we can see that the peak observed just above threshold is due to the presence of the @xmath65 state .",
    "the drc component is rather smooth and an interference effect seems to take place reducing the cross section at @xmath73 mev below the drc component .",
    "if a reaction is induced by real photons , the above equation can be employed directly to relate the direct and inverse channel . if , however , the photo - neutron process is to be induced by the virtual photons provided by a heavy-@xmath74 target , like in for heavy - ion collisions , the process is more complicated .    in the semi - classical limit ( coulomb trajectories ) the cross section distribution for coulomb dissociation",
    "is related to the photo - nuclear cross section by the relation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the excitation energy ( @xmath77 is the @xmath78 relative energy ) and @xmath79 the virtual - photon number of multipolarity @xmath28 at given incident energy @xmath80 and impact parameter @xmath81 .",
    "analytical expression for @xmath28 can be worked out and can be found in the literature@xcite .",
    "many breakup experiments have been recently performed using incident radioactive ion beams .",
    "examples includes @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and others .",
    "we report here on the results recently obtained in riken of the breakup of @xmath1 , the heaviest of these loosely bound systems observed so far .",
    "this case is interesting as the structure of @xmath1 was poorly known .",
    "the spin and parity of the ground state was uncertain as well as its neutron separation energy .",
    "the details of the experiment can be found in the reference@xcite .",
    "here we show the experimental results together with our calculation in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the experiment was performed at @xmath86 a mev . from a comparison of the experimental data with the theoretical calculation",
    "it has been concluded that : 1 ) the spin and parity of the @xmath1 ground state is @xmath87 , 2 ) the neutron binding energy is @xmath88 mev .",
    "here we limit ourselves in observing that the coulomb dissociation spectrum is well reproduced by the calculation based on a direct breakup model in which the @xmath1 ground state contains a large fraction ( @xmath89 ) of the configuration .",
