    "this paper investigates the role of the _ spread polynomials _ @xmath0 of _ rational trigonometry _ in understanding a simple dynamical system arising in elementary geometry .",
    "spread polynomials were introduced in @xcite , and arise naturally when euclidean geometry is studied _ algebraically , _ with angles replaced by spreads , and they play also a role in geometry over finite fields , and in fact over general fields not of characteristic two .",
    "furthermore their importance extends to _ elliptic _ and _ hyperbolic _ geometries , see @xcite .",
    "spread polynomials also have interesting number theoretical properties that set them apart from chebyshev and other orthogonal polynomials , see @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a phenomenon which occurs when we analyze iterates , or powers , of a particular rotation @xmath1 in the euclidean plane .",
    "if @xmath1 is the rotation by an angle @xmath2 which is a rational multiple of @xmath3 then the subsequent powers @xmath4 are easily understood .",
    "however when @xmath2 is an irrational multiple of @xmath5 , the situation exhibits chaotic features , and illustrates the ` butterfly effect ' : the future state of the system is determined by the accuracy by which we know the real numbers which specify initial conditions , and even a small error will eventually result in complete uncertainty  this is the standard view .    with rational trigonometry , _ increasing uncertainty _ is replaced with _ increasing complexity_. by measuring rotations @xmath1 with a _ spread _",
    "@xmath6 , not an _ angle _ @xmath2 , the spread polynomials arise naturally from iterates , and the chaos disappears , replaced instead by an increasing escalation in the size and complexity of the numbers @xmath0 that describe the evolution of the system .",
    "these numbers are far from random , and they tend to incorporate interesting , and indeed mysterious , number theoretic information .    for a rational spread @xmath7 we will prove a theorem about the spreads @xmath0 associated to the powers @xmath4 of the rotation @xmath1 with initial spread @xmath6 .",
    "such rational spreads are common in geometry , for example any configuration of lines with rational equations has only rational spreads . of particular interest",
    "is that we will need to examine _ finite geometries _ in order to understand the situation over the rational numbers , and that forms of _ non - euclidean geometry _ also arise .",
    "our work can also be viewed in the context of investigations of chebyshev polynomials over a finite field , initiated already in @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite .      to provide some motivation for the spread polynomials , recall that with the iso size standards , an @xmath8 sheet of paper has proportions in the ratio @xmath9 so if you fold a piece in two lengthwise , the result has the same proportions but only one half of the area , and is called @xmath10 size .",
    "the angle in degrees between the long side @xmath11 and the diagonal @xmath12 of an @xmath8 sheet may be described by the formula @xmath13 this has a numerical value in degrees of approximately @xmath14    suppose we rotate @xmath12 by @xmath15 to get @xmath16 then rotate @xmath17 by @xmath15 to get @xmath18 and so on .",
    "we could also say that @xmath17 is the reflection of @xmath11 in @xmath19 that @xmath20 is the reflection of @xmath12 in @xmath16 and so on .",
    "this gives a sequence * *  * * @xmath21 of concurrent lines whose respective angles with @xmath11 form the sequence @xmath22 since @xmath15 is not a rational multiple of @xmath3 these sequences of lines and angles will never repeat , and so the lines @xmath23 are all distinct , as are the angles @xmath24 .",
    "[ h ]    reflectionseq1.eps    figure [ multiples ] shows the first sixteen such lines , exhibiting the famous _ three gaps phenomenon , _ which was originally a conjecture of steinhaus , ( see for example @xcite ) : for any @xmath25 there are at most three different angles found between any two adjacent lines in the set @xmath26 .",
    "the angle between @xmath11 and @xmath27 is approximately @xmath28 we have lost information , however , and with the better initial approximation @xmath29 we get instead @xmath30 but no matter what accuracy we have for @xmath31 computing larger and larger multiples of it , mod @xmath32 inevitably results in increasing error  until after a finite number of multiples _ all knowledge of the position is lost_. this is a simple example of the well - known _ _  butterfly effect _ _ , a feature of a wide range of dynamical systems , and an inevitable consequence of working in the framework of classical trigonometry , which generally deals only with _ approximations _ to real values .",
    "the usual idea is that our understanding of the future evolution of many completely specified systems is limited by the precision with which we know the real numbers that appear in the initial conditions .    with _ rational trigonometry , _ introduced in _",
    "_  _ _ @xcite _ _ , _ _ we set our sights higher  we aim to describe such a system _ _  completely precisely , _ _ until we run out of computing power , memory space , or patience .",
    "the price we pay for _ more accuracy _",
    "is_more complexity_. for dynamical systems which can be expressed using rational numbers and polynomial transformations , the future evolution is completely known , but will generally be increasingly difficult and expensive to write down as time goes on",
    ". we will show that rotation by the angle @xmath15 exhibits this phenomenon , and brings out interesting number theoretical questions",
    ".    it will be important for us to consider not just rotations in the euclidean plane , but also over finite prime fields .",
    "for this it is often more convenient to work not with a unit circle , but rather with the _ associated projective line_. the metrical geometry of the projective line is described by a _ projective version of rational trigonometry _ , which also extends to higher projective spaces , and it is in terms of this that we formulate rotations and reflections .      here is a quick review of some main ideas from affine rational trigonometry in the plane ; the main reference is @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we work over a general field , not of characteristic two .",
    "the primary measurement is the _ quadrance _ between two points @xmath33   $ ] and @xmath34   $ ] , defined by@xmath35 over the real numbers , quadrance is the square of distance  or better yet _ distance is the square root of quadrance_. however in rational trigonometry we wish to avoid square roots , and so distance plays no role .",
    "this allows the theory to extend to more general fields .",

    "there are many such possible angles ( e.g. @xmath50 @xmath51 ) , but the square of the sine  the _ spread_is the same for all .",
    "the spread between two non - null lines can be expressed as a ratio of two quadrances  an opposite quadrance to a hypotenuse quadrance in a right triangle formed from those lines , so for example the spread between the long side @xmath11 of a piece of @xmath8 paper and its diagonal @xmath12 is @xmath52 unlike the notion of angle , spread really is defined between _ lines _ , not _",
    "rays_. using spreads instead of angles makes much of the study of triangles  that is , _ trigonometry_dramatically simpler .",
    "this is explained at length in @xcite .",
    "define a number @xmath6 to be a * spread number * precisely when @xmath53 is a square in the field .",
    "the spread number theorem ( ( * ? ? ? * chapter 6 ) ) asserts that a number @xmath6 is the spread between two lines precisely when @xmath6 is a spread number . in the finite prime field @xmath54 of @xmath55 elements , there are @xmath56 or @xmath57 spread numbers , depending respectively on whether @xmath55 is congruent to @xmath58 @xmath59 or @xmath49 @xmath60      the * spread polynomials * @xmath0 arise when we consider the rational analog of _ multiples of an angle_. they may be defined recursively , over a general field , without any reference to geometry as follows : @xmath61    the coefficient of @xmath62 in @xmath0 is a power of four , so over any field not of characteristic two , @xmath0 is a polynomial of degree @xmath63 .",
    "the generating function for the spread polynomials was computed by m. hirschhorn , it is @xmath64    the spread polynomials are intimately linked to geometry , in the following sense . if two intersecting lines @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the plane make a spread of @xmath7 then we may reflect @xmath11 in @xmath12 to obtain @xmath16 reflect @xmath12 in @xmath17 to obtain @xmath18 and so on .",
    "we will see that the spread @xmath65 is then @xmath0 . for this description",
    "we only need the lines through the origin , so it is really a statement about the associated _ projective line_. in fact our statement of this fact , the spread of a power theorem , will be stated in sufficient generality to include also some non - euclidean geometries , and will involve a multiplicative structure on the _ non - null points of the projective line_.    another key fact about the spread polynomials , which connects with their geometric interpretation , is the following .    * theorem ( spread composition ) * _ for any natural numbers _ @xmath63 _ _  and _ _ @xmath66 _ _  _ _",

    "the next figures show the first eight and twenty five spread polynomials over the real numbers in the range @xmath70 note the interesting ghost patterns that begin to appear as we increase the number of polynomials shown ; these are related to lissajous curves , and such a phenomenon occurs also for chebyshev polynomials .    observe also that the spread polynomials are positive in this range , so do not form an orthogonal family of polynomials in the usual sense unless they are translated vertically .",
