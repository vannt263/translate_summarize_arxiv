    "the hamiltonian cycle problem ( hcp ) is a famous graph theoretic decision problem that can be described simply : given a graph @xmath2 , determine whether it contains any simple cycles containing all vertices in the graph , or not .",
    "although hcp has been studied for over 250 years ( euler was studying the knights tour problem , a special case of hcp , as far back as 1759 ) , it has seen a recent resurgence in interest due to its placement in the np - complete list of problems .",
    "indeed , the reduction from vertex cover to hcp was among the first np - complete reductions published @xcite .    throughout this paper ,",
    "when referring to hcp in its traditional form , we will use the expression _",
    "general hcp_. an",
    "_ instance _ of general hcp takes the form of a simple graph , which is defined by its vertices and ( directed ) edges .",
    "we refer to the sum of the number of vertices and the number of edges of an instance as the _ input size _ of the instance .",
    "so if a graph contains @xmath3 vertices and @xmath4 edges , the input size is @xmath5 .",
    "however , any meaningful instance of hcp will have at least as many edges as vertices , or else it is trivially non - hamiltonian .",
    "for this reason , when talking about the order of the input size , it suffices to merely consider the number of edges in the graph .",
    "although the definition of general hcp permits any simple graph as an instance , a natural idea is to adopt restricted definitions of hcp in which only graphs that satisfy certain properties are to be considered .",
    "for some such restrictions , hcp is known to remain np - complete .",
    "the first of these was proved by karp @xcite , who showed that any general hcp instance can be converted to an equivalent instance which only contains undirected edges .",
    "the input size of the new instance is a linear function of that of the original instance .",
    "we will use the expression _ undirected hcp _ to describe the restricted version of hcp where only undirected instances are permitted . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we include the reduction here .    * converting general hcp to undirected hcp @xcite *    suppose we have a graph containing @xmath3 vertices , which forms an instance of general hcp .",
    "we can produce a new graph containing @xmath6 vertices , and add edges to it using the following algorithm .",
    "* add edges @xmath7 and @xmath8 for all @xmath9 .",
    "* for each ( directed ) edge @xmath10 in the original graph , add edge @xmath11 .    in the above procedure , a new graph instance is constructed from scratch . for convenience ,",
    "however , for the remainder of this manuscript we will think of such procedures as having replaced certain components of a graph with new components , whose constructions depend upon the components they are replacing . in the above procedure , each vertex",
    "is being replaced by three vertices , the second of which is linked to the other two by undirected edges .",
    "then , for each vertex , incoming edges are replaced by undirected edges adjacent to the first vertex , and outgoing edges are replaced by undirected edges adjacent to the third vertex .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig - directed ] .",
    "it is also important to note here that if the original instance has maximum in - degree @xmath12 and maximum out - degree @xmath0 , the new undirected instance will have maximum degree of @xmath13 .    ]",
    "it is easy to see that the undirected hcp instance resulting from the general hcp to undirected hcp conversion procedure is equivalent to the original instance .",
    "consider one of the sets of three vertices , and call them @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "suppose a hamiltonian cycle visits vertex @xmath14 .",
    "vertex @xmath14 is adjacent to the degree 2 vertex @xmath15 , so the latter must be visited immediately , and the cycle will then continue to vertex @xmath16 .",
    "from there , the only edges present correspond to outgoing edges in the original graph , and each of these lead to the first vertex in another block of three vertices .",
    "inductively , this process continues through the entire graph , and it is clear that a hamiltonian cycle may only exist in the undirected instance if one existed in the original instance .",
    "indeed , there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between hamiltonian cycles in the original instance and hamiltonian cycles in the equivalent undirected graph .    throughout this manuscript",
    ", we will refer to conversions as being _ polynomially - growing _ , depending on the degree of the polynomial that describes the new input size as a function of the old input size .",
    "for example , the above procedure describes a _ linearly - growing conversion _ , because the resultant graph has input size which is a linear function of the original input size .",
    "specifically , in the above conversion , if the original graph had @xmath3 vertices and @xmath4 ( directed ) edges , the new undirected graph will contain @xmath6 vertices , and @xmath17 undirected edges .",
    "in addition to the conversion from general hcp to undirected hcp , it was proved by garey et al @xcite that even if hcp is restricted to only instances that are undirected , cubic , planar and 3-connected , the problem is still np - complete .",
    "of course , this implies that one may restrict hcp instances to any subset of those four conditions and the problem will remain np - complete . in this manuscript",
    "we will be primarily interested in cubic , undirected hcp instances .",
    "we will refer to hcp restricted to such instances as _ cubic hcp _ ( note that the undirected condition is implied in this title ) .",
    "cubic hcp is a widely studied problem in its own right , with barnette s conjecture @xcite that every bipartite , planar , 3-connected cubic graph is hamiltonian still an open conjecture .",
    "more recently , eppstein @xcite conjectured that undirected cubic graphs with @xmath3 vertices have at most @xmath18 hamiltonian cycles , with gebauer @xcite providing the best proven bound to date of approximately @xmath19 .",
    "eppstein @xcite also provided an algorithm for finding hamiltonian cycles in cubic graphs .",
    "another open conjecture by filar et al @xcite is that almost all non - hamiltonian cubic graphs are bridge graphs , and may therefore be easily detected .",
    "the result of garey et al @xcite proves it is possible to convert general hcp instances into cubic hcp instances , allowing us to take advantage of the special structure of cubic graphs .",
    "however , in practice , using their approach is inefficient , as the reduction in @xcite is not from general hcp , but rather from boolean satisfiability ( sat ) in conjunctive normal form with clauses of size 3 ( 3sat ) .",
    "currently , the best known conversion from general hcp to sat is a cubically - growing conversion @xcite , and the conversion of sat to 3sat is a linearly - growing conversion @xcite . converting from 3sat to cubic , planar , 3-connected hcp using the method by garey et al requires a quadratically - growing conversion ; however , if we drop the requirement of planarity , the conversion reduces to linearly - growing .",
    "so , to convert a general hcp instance into a cubic hcp instance via the approach in @xcite , we must first convert to sat , then to 3sat , and finally to cubic hcp , which results in a cubically - growing conversion .    in this manuscript",
    ", we describe a new approach to convert directly ( that is , we remain within the scope of hcp for the entirety of the conversion ) from general hcp to cubic hcp , using a linearly - growing conversion .",
    "we begin by revising the well - known conversion for sub - cubic ( undirected ) hcp to cubic hcp .",
    "we then give conversions , to sub - cubic hcp , for the special cases of undirected hcp where the maximum degree is 4 or 5 .",
    "we follow this with a quadratically - growing conversion for general hcp to cubic hcp , and show that this approach constitutes a linearly - growing conversion if the maximum degree is bounded above by a constant .",
    "we also show that this approach can be applied to directed graphs , if desired .",
    "finally we provide a linearly - growing conversion from general hcp to hcp with bounded in - degree and out - degree ( for a sufficiently large upper bound ) , and using the previous results we conclude that general hcp may be reduced to cubic hcp via a linearly - growing conversion .",
    "we conclude with some examples of the savings to be gained by using this approach , compared with the approach in @xcite .",
    "consider an undirected graph with maximum degree 3 .",
    "we refer to hcp restricted to such instances as _ sub - cubic hcp_. then there is a simple procedure to convert sub - cubic hcp to cubic hcp .    *",
    "if the sub - cubic instance has any degree 1 vertices , the graph is non - hamiltonian , and may be replaced by any non - hamiltonian cubic graph ( such as the petersen graph @xcite ) . *",
    "otherwise , replace any degree 2 vertices with a diamond subgraph , as shown in figure [ fig - degree2 ] .    ]",
    "it is clear that the resultant graph is cubic . to see that the hamiltonicity has not been altered",
    ", it suffices to recognise that an introduced diamond , once entered , must be fully traversed before departing , as it will be impossible to enter it again .",
    "then this subgraph functions exactly the same as the vertex it replaced , and therefore the new cubic instance contains hamiltonian cycles if and only if the original instance did .",
    "it is also clear that the above procedure constitutes a linearly - growing conversion . even in the worst case , where all vertices are of degree 2 ,",
    "the number of vertices is only quadrupled and the number of edges is only sextupled .",
    "it is worth noting that the diamond subgraphs used in the above conversion can be traversed in either of two different ways .",
    "therefore , there is not a 1 - 1 relationship between the hamiltonian cycles in the sub - cubic instance , and the hamiltonian cycles in the converted instance . indeed ,",
    "if the sub - cubic instance contains @xmath20 vertices of degree 2 , then for each hamiltonian cycle in the sub - cubic instance there are @xmath21 different hamiltonian cycles in the cubic instance .",
    "the 1-many relationship is unfortunately unavoidable in general , as it is a known result that undirected cubic hamiltonian graphs must contain at least three hamiltonian cycles @xcite , but sub - cubic graphs may contain any number of hamiltonian cycles , i.e. 1 or 2 in particular .",
    "consider an undirected graph with maximum degree 4 .",
    "we refer to hcp restricted to such instances as _ sub - quartic hcp_. then there is a simple procedure to convert sub - quartic hcp to sub - cubic hcp .",
    "first we define a subgraph which we call a _ 4-gate _ , as displayed in figure [ fig-4gate ] .",
    "note that there are four edges , indicated by dashed lines in figure [ fig-4gate ] , by which the 4-gate may be entered or exited .",
    "we will refer to these four edges as _",
    "external edges_.    ]    it is possible to enter the 4-gate via any of the external edges , and exit via any of the remaining external edges , visiting every vertex exactly once.[lem-4 g ]    it suffices to give paths between any two of the external edges . since the 4-gate is undirected , the reverse path is obviously permitted , so we only need to consider unordered pairs .",
    "also , due to symmetry , the top and bottom edges are equivalent , as are the left and right edges .",
    "then there are only three cases that need to be considered , which are displayed in figure [ fig-4gate_paths ] .    top edge to left edge : the path is @xmath22 .",
    "+ top edge to bottom edge : the path is @xmath23 . + left edge to right edge : the path is @xmath24 .    , displayed here as bold edges.[fig-4gate_paths ] ]    in the following proof , and throughout the remainder of this manuscript ,",
    "we make use of the concept of a _ live edge _ , being one that may still be used without creating a short cycle . in general , if a vertex @xmath25 has only two live edges , and an adjacent vertex is visited , then vertex @xmath25 must be visited immediately afterwards in order for a hamiltonian cycle to be formed .    upon entering the 4-gate ,",
    "every vertex must be traversed before exiting in a hamiltonian cycle.[prop-4 g ]    suppose that during the course of a hamiltonian cycle , the 4-gate is entered , and then exited before all vertices are visited .",
    "then the hamiltonian cycle must later enter and exit the 4-gate again .",
    "therefore , one such path must enter or exit through the top edge .",
    "since the graph is undirected , without loss of generality we may assume that the top edge is entered .",
    "then , suppose the cycle travels from vertex 1 to 3 .",
    "at this point , the cycle may either continue to vertex 2 or 4 .",
    "if the cycle continues to vertex 4 , it must then continue to the degree 2 vertex 6 , and on to vertex 7 . then , since edge @xmath26 was not used , there are only two remaining live edges adjacent to vertex 8 , so the cycle must continue to vertex 8 and through to vertex 9 . at this point",
    "it must exit the right edge ( or else it will be impossible to re - enter and re - exit the 4-gate later ) .",
    "clearly then , since edges @xmath27 and @xmath28 were not used , it is now impossible to visit vertex 10 without getting stuck .",
    "if , instead , the cycle continues to vertex 2 , then using the same argument as above , it must exit via the left edge .",
    "then , some time later , the cycle re - enters the 4-gate .",
    "again , without loss of generality , suppose it enters via the right edge . then using the same argument as above ,",
    "the cycle is forced to travel the path @xmath29 . at this stage",
    ", the cycle must exit via the bottom edge , as it is the only remaining external edge .",
    "however , it is then impossible to visit vertex 10 .",
    "so we conclude that the initial choice of travelling from vertex 1 to 3 is flawed .",
    "however , due to symmetry , travelling from vertex 1 to 8 will be similarly flawed .",
    "therefore the initial assumption that the 4-gate was exited before all vertices was visited must be incorrect .    from lemma [ lem-4 g ] and proposition [ prop-4 g ]",
    "we see that the 4-gate functions the same as a degree 4 vertex .",
    "that is , once it is entered via one edge , any of the other three edges can be departed from , but only once the entire 4-gate has been traversed .",
    "then , the procedure to convert a sub - quartic instance to a sub - cubic instance is as follows .    *",
    "replace any degree 4 vertices with a 4-gate , with the four adjacent edges to the degree 4 vertex forming the four external edges to the 4-gate .",
    "since the 4-gate subgraphs are sub - cubic , and all remaining vertices in the original instance are degree 3 or less , the resulting instance is now sub - cubic .",
    "it is clear that the conversion from sub - quartic hcp to sub - cubic hcp is a linearly - growing conversion , where in the worst case there are 11 times as many vertices , and 4.5 times as many edges .",
    "then , since there is a linearly - growing conversion from sub - cubic hcp to cubic hcp , we conclude that there is a linearly - growing conversion from sub - quartic hcp to cubic hcp .",
    "we further extend the above idea by introducing the _ 5-gate _ , displayed in figure [ fig-5gate ] .    ]",
    "it is possible to enter the 5-gate via any of the external edges , and exit via any of the remaining external edges , visiting every vertex exactly once.[lem-5 g ]    again , it suffices to give the paths between any pair of external edges . due to symmetry",

    "however , now vertex 10 has only two remaining live edges , and so the hamiltonian cycle continues through vertices @xmath38 . at this point the bottom - right external edge must be used , or else there will not be enough remaining external edges to re - enter and re - exit later .",

    "so therefore , before visiting vertex @xmath14 , the path must have visited the vertex to the right of vertex @xmath14 , but due to vertices with only two live remaining edges , this means all vertices between @xmath14 and @xmath15 are on this path as well .",
    "then this path visits every vertex in the @xmath0-gate , violating the initial assumption , and therefore this case can not occur .",
    "this situation is displayed in the second part of figure [ fig - sgate_proof3 ] .    , where the paths are indicated by bold edges .",

    "then , inductively , we may substitute in smaller and smaller gates until a sub - cubic subgraph is reached .",

    "note that if we then proceed to convert the graph from sub - cubic to cubic , @xmath68 degree 2 vertices are replaced by diamond subgraphs , and so the resultant instance will have @xmath69 vertices and @xmath70 edges , including external edges .",
    "it should also be noted that there are multiple ways to traverse the @xmath0-gate , so the hamiltonian cycles in the original graph have a 1-many relationship with the hamiltonian cycles in the graph produced by the conversion algorithm .",

    "it can also be easily seen that @xmath74 . therefore , in the worst case , this conversion results in no more than @xmath75 vertices and edges in the sub - cubic hcp instance , and is therefore a quadratically - growing conversion .",
    "finally , after the linearly - growing conversion from sub - cubic hcp to cubic hcp , we obtain a quadratically - growing conversion from undirected hcp to cubic hcp .",
    "we now consider general hcp .",
    "the only distinction between general hcp and undirected hcp is that directed edges are permitted in instances of the former problem .",
    "in such a case , it makes sense to think not of the degree for each vertex , but rather the in - degree @xmath0 and out - degree @xmath12 for each vertex .",
    "of course , when considering such a problem we are permitted to simply convert it first to an undirected instance ( a linearly - growing conversion ) , and then proceed using the above conversion .",
    "however , in doing so , we raise the maximum degree by 1 , which may be inefficient , and triple the number of vertices before beginning the quadratically - growing conversion .",
    "an alternative approach is to simply use the above conversion , but to orient the external edges as necessary .",
    "so if a vertex has @xmath0 incoming edges and @xmath12 outgoing edges , an gate of size @xmath76 may be constructed whereby @xmath0 of the external edges are incoming edges and @xmath12 of the external edges are outgoing edges .",
    "we refer to such a gate , with directed external edges , as an @xmath77-gate .    to see that simply orienting the appropriate external edges will work , it is sufficient to recognise that directed edges behave exactly like undirected edges in the context of hcp , except that they are blocked \" from one end . by orienting the external edges ,",
    "a cycle will be similarly blocked from entering or exiting via an inappropriate external edge .    of course",
    ", in practice , there might be cases of an incoming edge coming from , and an outgoing edges going to , the same neighbouring vertex , in which case the two edges may be treated as a single undirected edge . in general , if a vertex @xmath25 has @xmath78 undirected edges , @xmath0 other incoming edges and @xmath12 other outgoing edges , then a gate of size @xmath79 , with @xmath78 undirected external edges and @xmath80 directed external edges , may be used .",
    "however , for the remainder of this manuscript , we will use @xmath77-gates for the sake of simplicity of arguments .",
    "following from the preceding discussion and lemma [ lem - quad ] , we conclude this section with an important corollary .",
    "if we restrict general hcp to instances in which the maximum in - degree and maximum out - degree are both bounded above by a fixed constant , then the conversion to cubic hcp described above is linearly - growing.[col - linear_conversion ]    suppose the general hcp instance contains @xmath3 vertices , and that the maximum in - degree and maximum out - degree of the graph are both bounded above by a fixed constant @xmath81 .",
    "then , from lemma [ lem - quad ] , we see that in the sub - cubic hcp instance there will be @xmath82 vertices and edges , and since @xmath83 , this simplies to @xmath84 .",
    "we use corollary [ col - linear_conversion ] in the following section , in which we describe a linearly - growing conversion from general hcp to general hcp of bounded in - degree and out - degree .",
    "the final approach to the conversion of general hcp to cubic hcp is quite simple to implement , but proving that it is linearly - growing requires all of the above results . during the conversion",
    "we will make use of three special subgraphs , which we call a split , an in - split and an out - split .",
    "a split contains two vertices , and the directed edge @xmath85 .",
    "there are external edges adjacent to vertices 1 and 2 , such that the external edges adjacent to vertex 1 are all incoming edges , and the external edges adjacent to vertex 2 are all outgoing edges .",
    "an in - split contains three vertices , and the directed edges @xmath85 , @xmath43 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and has external edges adjacent to each vertex .",
    "the external edges adjacent to vertices 1 and 2 are all incoming edges , and the external edges adjacent to vertex 3 are all outgoing edges .",
    "an out - split contains three vertices , and the directed edges @xmath85 , @xmath43 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and has external edges adjacent to each vertex .",
    "the external edges adjacent to vertex 1 are all incoming edges , while the external edges adjacent to vertices 2 and 3 are all outgoing edges .",
    "these three subgraphs are displayed in figure [ fig - split_graphs ] .    ]",
    "consider a graph containing any of the above three subgraphs .",
    "it is trivial to check that any hamiltonian cycle , upon entering the subgraph , must traverse every vertex before exiting .",
    "it is also trivial to check that it is possible to travel from any incoming external edge to any outgoing external edge . with this understanding in mind",
    ", we can easily see that replacing vertices by any of the above subgraphs does not alter hamiltonicity .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the number of hamiltonian cycles does not grow when a vertex is replaced by one of the above subgraph .",
    "we now consider a conversion using the above three subgraphs .",
    "suppose that a general hcp instance is given .",
    "it will be assumed that every edge in the graph is directed , and so any undirected edges should be thought of as two individual directed edges .",
    "the objective will be to replace all vertices of large in - degree or large out - degree ( or both ) with subgraphs , such that the final graph has maximum in - degree and maximum out - degree below a fixed constant , say @xmath81 .",
    "we will choose @xmath89 , but as will become clear later , @xmath81 may be chosen for any integer value of 4 or above .    consider a particular vertex @xmath25 in the graph , with in - degree @xmath0 and out - degree @xmath12 , where @xmath90 .",
    "we may replace this vertex with a subgraph by a procedure called the splitting procedure , which we outline below .",
    "note that throughout the splitting procedure we refer to replacing vertices with the subgraphs described above .",
    "this should be done in such a way that the incoming edges adjacent to the replaced vertex form the incoming external edges in the subgraph , and likewise for the outgoing edges . for the in - split",
    ", there are two sets of incoming external edges , and so the incoming edges adjacent to the replaced vertex should be shared equally ( or different by one , if there is an odd number ) between these two sets . likewise ,",
    "for the out - split , there should be an equal share of the outgoing edges in each of the two sets of outgoing external edges .",
    "an example of such a replacement , using an in - split , is displayed in figure [ fig - in_split_replaced ] .    ]    * replace vertex @xmath25 with a split .",
    "* while any vertex in the subgraph has in - degree greater than @xmath81 , replace that vertex with an in - split . *",
    "while any vertex in the subgraph has out - degree greater than @xmath81 , replace that vertex with an out - split .",
    "the splitting procedure terminates in finite time for any @xmath91.[lem - splitting_converges ]    consider a vertex with in degree @xmath0 and out - degree @xmath12 .",
    "the first step of the splitting procedure occurs only once .",
    "after it has concluded , the first vertex in the split will have in - degree @xmath0 and out - degree 1 , and the second vertex will have in - degree 1 and out - degree @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to note here that neither of these vertices will have both in - degree and out - degree greater than @xmath81 .",
    "next , the second step runs for as long as vertices with in - degree greater than @xmath81 exist .",
    "initially there can only be one vertex ( the first vertex ) that satisfies this requirement .",
    "then , each time a vertex @xmath60 with in - degree @xmath92 is replaced with an in - split , the maximum in - degree of the replacing subgraph is @xmath93 .",
    "it is easy to see that the resultant in - degree will shrink by an integer amount for any @xmath94 .",
    "therefore step 2 will conclude in finite time for any @xmath91 .",
    "the final step is equivalent to the second step , except the arguments involve the out - degree .",
    "therefore , this step will also conclude for @xmath91 , and the algorithm will therefore terminate in finite time .",
    "since the splitting procedure terminates in finite time , and can not alter the hamiltonicity of the graph , the splitting procedure is guaranteed to convert any vertex of large in - degree or large out - degree ( or both ) to an equivalent subgraph of maximum in - degree and out - degree of @xmath81 . then if this is performed on all vertices in the graph , the resultant graph instance is equivalent to the original graph instance , but has in - degree and out - degree bounded above by @xmath81 .",
    "the only remaining task is to determine how large the resultant graph will be after the splitting procedure is applied to all vertices . in the following proposition",
    "we consider one vertex @xmath25 in a graph , and show that the number of vertices in the replacing subgraph is a linear function of the in - degree and out - degree of @xmath25 .    consider a vertex @xmath25 with in - degree @xmath0 and out - degree @xmath12 .",
    "after the splitting procedure is completed for a chosen @xmath91 , the resultant subgraph that replaces @xmath25 has @xmath95 vertices and @xmath95 edges.[prop - degree_d ]    after the first step of the splitting procedure , the subgraph has 2 vertices .",
    "this includes a vertex with in - degree @xmath0 and out - degree 1 , and a vertex with out - degree @xmath12 and in - degree 1 .",
    "it is important to note here that there are no vertices in the subgraph that have both in - degree greater than @xmath81 and out - degree greater than @xmath81 . call this process `` stage 0 '' .    in the second step of the splitting procedure",
    ", we may replace the first vertex with an in - split ( if @xmath96 ) , and in the third step we may replace the third vertex with an out - split ( if @xmath97 ) . call this process `` stage 1 '' . at this point",
    "the subgraph has at most six vertices .",
    "two of them , one from the in - split , and one from the out - split , will require no further work , as they will all have in - degree and out - degree less than @xmath81 .",
    "so at this point there are at most four vertices that require additional work .",
    "the in - splits will contain two vertices with potentially large in - degree , and the out - splits will contain two vertices with potentially large out - degree . consider the in - split .",
    "vertices 1 and 2 will each have half as many incoming edges as the vertex they replaced , possibly rounded up ( if the number is odd ) , plus one more incoming edge from the other vertex .",
    "an equivalent argument can be made for the out - split .",
    "then it is clear that each of the four vertices still requiring work has maximum in - degree or out - degree bounded above by @xmath98 or @xmath99 . to simplify expressions",
    ", we will assume that @xmath100 , and so in the worst case all four vertices have in - degree or out - degree @xmath98 .",
    "of course , the arguments that proceed are identical if @xmath101 , with all instances of @xmath0 replaced by @xmath12 .",
    "we then replace the four vertices with appropriate in - splits and out - splits .",
    "call this process `` stage 2 '' . using the same argument as above",
    ", we see that the maximum in - degree or out - degree of the in - splits and out - splits used is @xmath102 , and in each of the in - splits and out - splits there are at most two vertices that have in - degree or out - degree greater than @xmath81 .",
    "we can then continue the process of replacing high - degree vertices with in - splits and out - splits , and it is easy to check that at stage @xmath60 there are @xmath103 new subgraphs introduced , and so there are at most @xmath104 vertices that still require work .",
    "denote by @xmath71 the maximum in - degree or out - degree of vertices at stage @xmath60 .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath105 , with @xmath106 . solving this recursive relationship",
    ", we obtain that @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , the maximum in - degree or out - degree after @xmath108 iterations , in the worst case , is something less than @xmath109 .",
    "we can then see how many iterations are necessary to reduce all vertices in the subgraph to maximum in - degree and out - degree to @xmath89 or lower :    @xmath110    so for all iterations @xmath111 , the subgraph has all vertices with in - degree and out - degree @xmath81 or lower .",
    "so in the worst case , we will not need to consider more than @xmath112 iterations .",
    "we can now see how many vertices exist in the final subgraph . at each stage",
    "@xmath113 we introduced @xmath103 new subgraphs ( in - splits and out - splits ) , which each included a vertex that we did not need to further convert .",
    "then , in stage @xmath108 there were @xmath114 vertices introduced .",
    "therefore the total number of vertices is at most :    @xmath115 + 3(2^n ) = 2^{n+2 } - 1 \\leq \\frac{8s}{d-3 } - 1,\\ ] ]    and therefore , the number of vertices in the final subgraph is of order @xmath116 .",
    "since each vertex has bounded degree , it is clear that the number of edges is also @xmath116 .    of course , as mentioned earlier , if @xmath101 then the above bounds are @xmath117 instead , which leads to the result .",
    "it is trivial to see that replacing a vertex with a subgraph , using the above procedure , does not alter the in - degree or out - degree of any other vertex in the graph .",
    "then we may simply perform the above procedure for all vertices in the graph with in - degree or out - degree greater than @xmath81 .",
    "suppose that , in the original instance containing @xmath3 vertices , vertex @xmath60 has maximum in - degree or out - degree @xmath71 , and define @xmath118 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath20 at least as big as the number of directed edges in the graph .",
    "then , when the splitting procedure is applied to all vertices in the graph , there will be @xmath119 vertices of in - degree and out - degree no larger than @xmath81 .",
    "finally , we present the main theorem of this manuscript .    using the procedures described in this manuscript , one may convert any general hcp instance to an equivalent ( undirected ) cubic hcp instance containing @xmath119 vertices and @xmath119 edges , where @xmath20 is defined as above .",
    "the result follows immediately from proposition [ prop - degree_d ] and corollary [ col - linear_conversion ] .",
    "since the number of vertices in the original instance will definitely not be greater than the number of directed edges ( or else the instance is trivially non - hamiltonian ) , we can easily see that the input size of the original instance is of order @xmath119 .",
    "then the upcoming procedure constitutes a linearly - growing conversion from general hcp to cubic hcp . in order to relate this result to",
    "the classical sat to 3sat `` result of karp @xcite , which is also a linearly - growing conversion , we label the following as the hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure '' .",

    "* convert the directed graph to an undirected graph .",
    "* replace all degree 4 vertices with 4-gates using the sub - quartic hcp to sub - cubic hcp conversion procedure .",
    "* convert the sub - cubic graph to a cubic graph using the sub - cubic hcp to cubic hcp conversion procedure .",
    "note that in the above procedure , we may instead choose to swap the third and fourth items .",
    "if so , the fifth step may be omitted .    in reality , the hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure as described above is needlessly heavy - handed .",
    "although the proof of proposition [ prop - degree_d ] is only valid for @xmath91 , it can be checked that once the maximum in - degree or out - degree in a replacing subgraph has been reduced to 4 , using one more iteration of in - splits and out - splits will reduce the maximum in - degree and out - degree to 3 ( the lowest it may be reduced to ) .",
    "clearly this one additional iteration of replacements can only double the size of the resultant graph , so the conversion remains linearly - growing .",
    "if the graph is then converted to an undirected graph at this point , the maximum degree will be 4 , at which point 4-gates may be used .",
    "we summarise this alteration in the following procedure , which we call the quick hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure \" .    *",

    "we recommend that interested readers use the quick hcp to 3hcp conversion rather than the original hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure , both for ease of implementation , and for the sake of the size of the resultant instance .",
    "we provide a bound on the size of instances produced by this conversion at the end of this section .",
    "we now display , in figures [ fig - example1][fig - example4 ] , a vertex with in - degree 9 and out - degree 6 , and the various intermediate steps as it is converted to an equivalent cubic subgraph by the quick hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure .",

    "consider a graph @xmath2 , and denote by @xmath20 the sum of in - degrees and out - degrees of all vertices in @xmath2 .",
    "then the instance obtained after performing the quick hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure will contain no more than @xmath122 vertices.[lem - final - size ]    consider a single vertex in @xmath2 , with in - degree @xmath0 and out - degree @xmath12 .",
    "it is easy to check that the subgraph which replaces this vertex after step 1 of the quick hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure ( e.g. see figure [ fig - example1 ] ) will contain no more than one vertex adjacent to each external edge .",
    "it can also be easily checked that there will be more vertices adjacent to external edges than those not adjacent .",
    "therefore an upper bound on the number of vertices in the replacing subgraph is @xmath123 , and so , once step 1 is carried out for all vertices in @xmath2 , the number of vertices in the resultant subgraph will be no more than @xmath124 . note that",
    "at this stage , there are at most @xmath20 vertices with maximum in - degree or out - degree of 4 .    in step 2 ,",
    "the number of vertices is tripled , so there are at most @xmath125 vertices .",

    "we replace @xmath20 vertices with 4-gates , which each contain 11 vertices , including one vertex of degree 2 .",
    "so at this point the number of vertices is no more than @xmath126 , of which at most @xmath127 vertices have degree 2 .    in step 4 ,",
    "we replace at most @xmath127 vertices with diamonds , which each contain 4 vertices .",
    "so after the quick hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure is completed , the graph contains at most @xmath122 vertices .    for undirected graphs containing @xmath4 edges , it is trivial to see that @xmath128 .",
    "the following corollary is this obvious , and does away with the need to count the in - degree and out - degree of each vertex .",

    "this is partially due to the unnecessary conversion to a directed graph and then back again , after which the number of vertices is tripled . even for directed graphs ,",

    "in fact , although it is not stated explicitly in @xcite , it can be relatively easily checked that if the 3sat instance has @xmath131 clauses and @xmath108 literals , the resultant cubic graph will contain @xmath132 vertices .",
    "it is also interesting to note that ariadne100 produces sat instances for which the number of vertices bounds the size , rather than edges . specifically , if a graph has @xmath3 vertices and @xmath4 undirected edges , the sat instance has @xmath133 and @xmath134 literals .",
    "note that this implies that dense graphs will actually produce smaller sat instances than more sparse graphs of the same number of vertices .",
    "this is in contrast to our result , where the size of the resultant graph instance grows proportionally to the number of edges present in the original graph instance .",
    "the comparative results are listed in table [ tab - results ] . in the first column of table [ tab - results ]",

    ", we list the number of vertices in the resultant cubic graph after applying the quick hcp to 3hcp conversion procedure . in the fifth column",
    ", we list the number of vertices in the resultant cubic graph after replacing all vertices with appropriate @xmath0-gates iteratively until a cubic graph is obtained . in the sixth column",
    ", we list the number of vertices in the resultant cubic graph after the alternative approach using the result of garey et al .",
    "we have chosen twelve well - known undirected graphs to consider as instances of hcp , which we describe after table [ tab - results ] .",
    ".comparative sizes of cubic graphs obtained from the conversions of some famous higher - degree graphs .",
    "the hcp to 3hcp conversion and @xmath0-gate conversion are those described in this manuscript .",
    "the garey et al conversion is that which uses ( in the final step ) the result by garey et al @xcite.[tab - results ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ tab - results ] indicates very clearly the savings that may be obtained from using the approaches described in this manuscript .",
    "note here that the examples with smaller degree actually result in the quadratically - growing conversion outperforming the linearly - growing conversion .",
    "for the examples of larger degree , however , the linearly - growing conversion is superior .",
    "both approaches dramatically outperform the approach of first converting to sat , then to 3sat , and finally back to 3hcp .",
    "the twelve famous graph instances considered are :    * the complete graph on 10 vertices , @xmath135 .",
    "* goldner - harary graph @xcite , the smallest non - hamiltonian maximal planar graph . * sousselier graph , one of four hypohamiltonian graph on 16 vertices ( see aldred et al @xcite ) .",
    "* 6-andrsfai graph @xcite , a circulant graph in which each vertex @xmath60 is adjacent to vertices @xmath136 for all @xmath137 congruent to @xmath138 .",
    "* 24-cell , also known as the icositetrachoron , the unique self - dual euclidian polytope that is neither a polygon nor a simplex ( see coxeter @xcite ) . * paley graph @xcite on 29 vertices , one of an infinite family of conference graphs . *",
    "foster cage , one of four ( 5,5)-cages ( see meringer @xcite , or wong @xcite who listed the foster cage but missed one of the other ( 5,5)-cages ) .",
    "* sheehan-40 graph , one of an infinite family of maximal uniquely hamiltonian graphs ( see sheehan @xcite ) . *",
    "sims - gewirtz graph @xcite , an integral 10regular graph with the unique graph spectrum @xmath139 . * 8x8 knight s tour graph , in which each vertex corresponds to a square on the chessboard , and with edges present only when one square can be reached from another by the move of a knight ( see conrad et al @xcite ) .",
    "* sheehan-80 graph , another of the infinite family described by sheehan @xcite .",
    "* the complete graph on 100 vertices , @xmath140 .",
    "it should be noted that the intention of table [ tab - results ] is not to disparage the result in garey et al , but rather to indicate the folly of switching problem frameworks unnecessarily , or alternatively , the desirability of developing problem - specific conversions rather than relying on those that exist via other np - complete problems .",
    "we conclude this manuscript with a short discussion on this topic .",
    "in the years since the cook - levin theorem @xcite was published , and karp @xcite listed 21 np - complete problems with sat as a base , it has become commonplace for researchers to think of sat as the best choice of problem to use for conversions . indeed , other than perhaps 0 - 1 integer programming , the majority of algorithmic development for solving np - complete problems appears to have been focused on sat . however , there is nothing inherently special about sat to warrant this special consideration among other np - complete problems .",
    "conversely , there has been relatively little attention paid to the degree of the polynomial that arises in conversions of one np - complete problem to another .",
    "as long as the conversion is polynomially - growing , it is deemed to be efficient . however , in practice , even if a polynomial - time algorithm could be found for some special np - complete problem , other problems of real - world size would still be intractable if they first require a conversion that grows the input size by a polynomial of even moderate degree ( even two or three ) .",
    "even extremely fast heuristics are practically useless for real - world sized problems if the input size has been blown up by anything larger than linear growth .",
    "perhaps the first specific consideration of linearly - growing conversions was by dewdney @xcite who showed that six problems have linearly - growing conversions to sat and from sat .",
    "creignou @xcite extended this idea by developing the concept of _ sat - easy _ and _ sat - hard _ problems .",
    "she described sat - easy problems as those that are reducible to satisfiability with linear growth in the input size , and sat - hard problems as those that may be obtained by a reduction from satisfiability with linear growth in the input size .",
    "if a problem is both sat - easy and sat - hard , creignou calls it _ sat - equivalent_. in her paper , creignou described 14 np - complete problems which are sat - equivalent , but identified only two np - complete problems which are sat - hard but not sat - easy , one of which is hcp ( the other is the disjoint connecting paths problem ) .",
    "creignou also suggested that the 3-colorability problem ( 3col ) might be the most natural np - complete problem , and provided a methodology of constructing reductions to 3col for many np - complete problems .",
    "motivated by the result of the present manuscript , we hope to investigate the equivalent notion of _ hcp - easy _ , _ hcp - hard _ and _ hcp - equivalent _ problems .",
    "certainly it is clear , from the result in @xcite , that any problem which is sat - easy must also be hcp - easy , however the converse is not known to be true .",
    "likewise , a problem which is hcp - hard must also be sat - hard .",
    "the result in the present manuscript indicates that 3hcp is hcp - equivalent but is not known to be sat - equivalent .",
    "the study of which problems are hcp - equivalent but not sat - equivalent , and vice versa , is a topic for future research .",
    "research is also warranted on the question of which problems may be converted , with only linear growth , directly to hcp , rather than via sat .",
    "although there are many np - complete problems known to have linearly - growing conversions to sat , and therefore to hcp , it seems inefficient to convert via another problem if it is not necessary to do so .",
    "a recent example of such research @xcite demonstrated that the set splitting problem , long known to have a linearly - growing conversion to sat , also has a linearly - growing conversion directly to hcp with very small coefficients .",
    "ultimately , it seems natural to try to identify what might be thought of as a _ minimal set _ of np - complete problems , being the smallest possible set such that every other np - complete problem may be converted to one in the minimal set with only a linear growth in the input size . determining which problems may lie in this minimal set seems a fascinating topic which , to date , does not appear to have been considered at all . with computing power having improved to the stage where clever heuristics are now a viable method of solving many real - world sized np - complete problem instances",
    ", the time seems right for such exploration to occur .",
