    "nucleons inside nuclei are commonly described in terms of quasi particles with an effective mass connected to the mean - field potential .",
    "however , it also known that such strongly interacting particles obtain a finite width @xcite from processes that correspond in lowest order ( beyond the mean - field approximation ) to collision reactions .",
    "the so - called collisional broadening is therefore a feature that should be accounted for in nuclear reactions where the nucleons frequently collide with each other or with other particles .",
    "the nucleons in the nuclear groundstate are subject to a broadening due to short - range correlations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in inclusive reactions such as electron scattering off nuclei these effects",
    "have been taken into account and proven to have influence ( e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite photon induced @xmath3 production and proton induced production of heavy mesons @xmath4 on carbon has been studied within the framework of folding models showing also an influence in more exklusive reactions . in the energy regime where nucleon resonances play an important role",
    "there is another modification that should be taken into account : in the vacuum , it is known that the decay width of resonances into channels with unstable mesons ( e.g. @xmath5 ) is strongly influenced by the meson spectral function .",
    "if the rho meson was a stable particle with a mass of 770 mev , a @xmath6 resonance with a mass of 1.524 gev could not decay into @xmath7 .",
    "however , the branching ratio into this channel is in the range of 15 - 25% @xcite .",
    "therefore , also the decay width of the nucleon resonances into channels with nucleons should change when the nucleon spectral function deviates from a delta function in the medium .    in the framework of transport models , theoretical concepts for the offshell propagation of nucleons",
    "have been developed @xcite , which was a prerequisite for the treatment of offshell nucleons in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "we are , therefore , now in a position to be able to combine the aspects of the groundstate correlations and the nucleon spectral function in the fsi as well as the propagation to study more exclusive reactions with electromagnetic probes . in this work ,",
    "we consider @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction on nuclei @xmath8 in the second resonance region and study the influence of the nucleon spectral function . for these energies",
    ", this channel is particularly interesting , because of the strong connection between the @xmath0 meson and the @xmath1 resonance . in particular we will focus on the sensitivity of such reactions on the groundstate correlations and the modification of the @xmath1 decay width . for our calculations on nuclei",
    "we use a semi - classical buu transport model , which we already used for the calculation of these processes using the onshell approximation for the nucleons @xcite .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "[ sec : nucl - spec - fct ] with a discussion of the nucleon spectral function used in our calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : s11-dec ] we describe how the decay widths are modified by the nucleon spectral function in the medium , followed by some details about the the calculation of the cross sections on nuclei and the buu model in sec .",
    "[ sec : el - react ] and [ sec : buu - model ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we show our results on @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction on calcium .",
    "the influence of the nucleon spectral function is twofold : on the one hand , there are correlations between the nucleons in the nuclear groundstate leading to a finite width .",
    "the nucleon spectral function in nuclear matter was calculated in @xcite using transport theoretical methods .",
    "the width was obtained by calculating collision widths .",
    "there it was found that for a description of the spectral function properties the knowledge of the overall strength of the nucleon interaction is already sufficient . determining this parameter from more sophisticated many - body models @xcite , both momentum cuts of the spectral function and the momentum distribution are in very good agreement with such approaches .",
    "we have performed the same calculations for different densities . using local density approximation , we were then able to apply our nucleon spectral function also to the groundstate of finite nuclei .",
    "a similar procedure was used in @xcite to obtain the momentum distribution in finite nuclei . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom - mass - spec ] we show the mass and momentum spectra in a calcium nucleus , determined by the spectral function .",
    "it is seen than the mass spectrum shows a strong asymmetry with respect to the still dominating onshell peak ; most nucleons off the mass shell have masses @xmath9 .",
    "this can be easily understood if we consider for simplicity nuclear matter . in the groundstate",
    "all states with energy smaller than the fermi energy @xmath10 are occupied .",
    "the nucleons with pole mass @xmath11 obey the condition @xmath12 .",
    "the region in the @xmath13 plane , where @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 , is confined by the onshell curve , the @xmath16 axis and the condition @xmath17 and is therefore only a small fraction of the whole area @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the nucleons undergo collisions in the course of the fsi .",
    "this also gives rise to a finite width for nucleons with energies above the fermi energy .",
    "these widths are determined by evaluating the collision rates for the reactions involving nucleon as incoming particles for energies above the fermi energy ( at @xmath18 the widths vanish otherwise due to pauli blocking ) . for elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering @xmath19 e.g.",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the relative velocity of the incoming particles and @xmath22 is the spin - isospin degeneracy factor . the spectral function @xmath23 is given by @xcite @xmath24 the widths for the fsi reactions are therefore calculated on the same footing as for the groundstate correlations . for other collisional processes , equivalent expressions can be written down .",
    "note that the cross section for the nucleon reactions enters eq .",
    "( [ eq : collrate ] ) .",
    "since we make use of vacuum cross sections @xcite , we only calculate the nucleon spectral function for the fsi on the nucleon mass shell .",
    "therefore , the resulting width only depends on density and momentum , but not independently on the nucleon energy .",
    "for the nucleons , the total width is obtained by calculating the collision rates for the processes @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are explicitly implemented in our transport model ( for details see ref .",
    "other contributions can be neglected , because the multiplicities of the nucleon scattering partners are negligible . for larger energies , when more inelastic multi - particle channels open , we use in eq .",
    "( [ eq : collrate ] ) the parametrization for the total cross section from @xcite and evaluate the collision width by omitting the pauli blocking factors for the outgoing fermions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : onshell - width ] we compare the width in the nuclear matter rest frame for density @xmath29 as a function of energy with the onshell widths obtained from the many - body results of @xcite . in the considered energy range ,",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    "we have calculated the nucleon width as a function of momentum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwidth - dens ] the width in the rest frame of the nucleon is shown for different density values as a function of momentum .",
    "the width exhibits the zero at the fermi momentum and then increases with growing inelasticity .",
    "the connection of the width in the nucleon rest frame ( rf ) to that in the nuclear matter rest frame ( lab ) is given by @xmath30 therefore , @xmath31 is larger than @xmath32 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the nucleon width arising from the fsi in eq .",
    "( [ eq : collrate ] ) for nucleon energies above the fermi energy @xmath10 is calculated on the same footing as the width arising from the groundstate correlations in @xcite for energies below @xmath10 .",
    "the difference is , that in @xcite we used an averaged in - medium matrix element , whereas in eq .",
    "( 1 ) the matrix element is substituted by the nn - vacuum cross section .",
    "both widths , however , approach each other because they vanish at @xmath33 .",
    "in this section we discuss how the nucleon spectral function influences the in - medium decay of nucleon resonances .",
    "the strength of the effect is determined by the nucleon width . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : nucl - spec - fct ] , this depends on the momentum of the nucleons stemming from the resonance decay , and the density .",
    "there it was shown ( see fig .",
    "3 ) that with increasing momentum , the in - medium width of the nucleon reaches values comparable to the rho width in vacuum ( 250 mev ) .",
    "therefore , an appreciable effect of nuclear collisional broadening should also be seen .",
    "the question remains in which reactions resonances with such large momenta can be prepared .",
    "recently we have discussed @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction on nuclei @xcite in the onshell limit for the nucleons . in this case , the @xmath1 is the dominating degree of freedom for eta production .",
    "most detected etas stem from the decay of a @xmath34 produced in the elementary reaction @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "the resonance momentum depends on the momentum transfer in this reaction . for virtual photons",
    ", the virtuality @xmath37 can be chosen independently from the photon energy , which allows for a preparation of resonances with a certain fixed mass and different momenta : in photoproduction , a @xmath34 resonance with pole mass has a momentum of 0.78 gev , in electroproduction at @xmath38 gev@xmath39 a momentum of 3.3 gev .",
    "also resonances experience a collisional broadening @xcite . for resonance momenta up to 1 gev",
    "as encountered in photoproduction , the collision width is rather small ( @xmath40 30 mev at @xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "the calculation for larger resonance momenta of several gev by using collision rates is difficult because the cross section @xmath41 in this kinematical regime is unknown . also estimates based on the total @xmath42 cross section would not help because a broadening and/or suppression of the electron - nucleus cross section caused by the collision width depends on a reliable separation of @xmath43 into contributions arising from absorptive reactions and processes with a @xmath34 or other particles leading to @xmath0 production in the final state @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus only on the modification of the in - medium decay width .",
    "since we are interested in @xmath0 production , we confine our considerations to a modification of the @xmath1 only .",
    "moreover , only the most important decay channels , @xmath44 and @xmath2 , will be modified .",
    "the vacuum resonance widths used in our buu transport model are parametrized in the same way as in @xcite , which for the resonance decay @xmath45 is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the total decay width at the pole mass @xmath48 . in the vacuum ,",
    "the @xmath49-function for a decay into a stable nucleon and a stable meson reads : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the c.m .",

    "momenta behaves like @xmath55 , thereby ensuring the correct momentum dependence of the width close to threshold @xcite . in the case of the @xmath1 we have @xmath56 .",
    "the expression for @xmath57 is close to the general expression for the width @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath59 can be identified with the two - body phase space .",
    "the number @xmath60 in the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : manley - par ] ) therefore is part of the matrix element which describes the coupling @xmath45 and will be left untouched when we go to the medium . for the decay of a resonance into a stable meson and a broad nucleon in the medium , the function @xmath57 in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : manley - par ] ) is extended by performing an integration over the nucleon spectral function .",
    "this is actually the same as what is done in @xcite for the parametrization of the resonance decay in vacuum into a stable nucleon and an unstable meson , e.g. @xmath5 .",
    "hence , we end up with the expression @xmath61 with @xmath62 the spectral function @xmath63 ( see eq .",

    "the dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inmed - width ] ) on @xmath66 arises from the necessity of boosting the nucleon momentum from the c.m .",

    "the quantity @xmath67 is a numerical parameter for the minimal nucleon mass considered in out calculations ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : buu - model ] ) .",
    "it is chosen in a way that the dependence of the widths on this parameter is negligible .    for lower resonance momenta ,",
    "pauli blocking of outgoing nucleons is important .",
    "this can be accounted for by averaging over the decay angle in the c.m .",
    "frame @xcite : @xmath68 here , @xmath16 is the energy of the decaying nucleon and @xmath10 is the local fermi energy ; in the case of offshell nucleons at @xmath18 the relevant information about the occupation of states in the ( local ) nuclear matter is given by the fermi energy and not by the fermi momentum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : s11width ] we show the results of the decay widths @xmath69 ( left panel ) and @xmath70 ( right panel ) for density @xmath29 and different resonance momenta as a function of @xmath52 .",

    "for the sake of a better resolution in the threshold region , the results are also shown in log plots in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : s11width ] .",
    "the influence of the nucleon spectral function leads to a decrease of the partial widths for larger resonance masses and to finite , non - zero values for masses below the vacuum threshold .",
    "this behavior is the more pronounced the larger the resonance momentum is chosen and is strongly connected to the increase of the nucleon width with nucleon momentum observed in sec .",
    "[ sec : nucl - spec - fct ] .",
    "however , we have checked that the sensitivity to the components of the nucleon spectral function with very large widths is rather small .",
    "actually , for resonance momenta below 4 gev we would obtain almost the same results , when we cut the nucleon width at @xmath71 gev in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwidth - dens ] , leaving the nucleon width constant for momenta above .",
    "this is due to the fact that the average nucleon momenta stemming from the @xmath34 decay for such resonance momenta does not exceed @xmath72 gev significantly in the given resonance mass range .    since we want to calculate production reactions of the type @xmath73 , it is worthwhile to see how the branching ratios @xmath74 are influenced . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bratio ] we show the branching ratios for @xmath44 and @xmath2 for different momenta as a function of the resonance mass . since in photon - nucleus reactions also densities smaller than @xmath29 are encountered , we also show the situation for density @xmath75 on the right - hand side .",
    "the short - dotted curves again show the vacuum case . in the @xmath44 channel",
    "we observe a step - like function that comes about because for @xmath76 pion decay is the only relevant decay channel .",
    "the partial pion width exhibits a strong smoothening of the step - like structure with @xmath66 which is less pronounced at lower density and/or lower momentum values .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath2 which has a clear cut in the vacuum at the onshell @xmath2 threshold @xmath77 .",

    "we now discuss the sensitivity of photon- and electron - induced reactions to the correlated part of the nucleon spectral function in the groundstate of the nucleus . in @xcite",
    "we have modeled photon - nucleus and electron - nucleus reactions by the absorption of the real or virtual photon on a single nucleon . therefore , the quantity of interest is the invariant mass of the photon - nucleon pairs inside the nucleus .",
    "the invariant mass spectra are generated by distributing the nucleons inside the nucleus according to a woods - saxon density in coordinate space .",
    "using local density approximation , the momenta and masses are determined according to the spectral function discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : nucl - spec - fct ] .",
    "this is the same procedure also used for the initialization of the nuclei for our transport calculations , for details we therefore refer to @xcite . for simplicity ,",

    "for @xmath9 this value is larger than the local fermi momentum @xmath81 , and according to sec .",
    "[ sec : nucl - spec - fct ] this is the case for most of the nucleons off the mass shell .    in fig .",

    "this effect is due to fermi motion @xcite . using the nucleon spectral function ,",
    "some strength is moved to smaller and also to larger invariant masses , which is accompanied by a depletion in the region of the distribution maximum due to the depletion of the onshell peak .    for the virtual photon case the contribution at low invariant masses extends to @xmath85 values smaller than 1 gev and",
    "is not shown here .",
    "it is obvious that the contribution for @xmath85 values larger than the maximal onshell c.m .",
    "energy is more pronounced at finite @xmath37 . indeed , this behavior is the stronger the larger @xmath37 becomes .",

    "spectrum , we can expect an influence of the groundstate correlations on the threshold region of cross sections for particle production .",
    "moreover , close to the maximum of the cross section ( i.e. in resonant production processes ) , a decrease will be observed due to the depletion of strength close to the maximum of the @xmath85 spectrum .",

    "the lower plot shows the threshold region in more detail .",
    "the solid and dash - dotted curves show the onshell results with and without fsi .",
    "it is seen that the calculation with fsi yields a somewhat larger cross section .",
    "this effect , discussed in @xcite , is due to the fact that in reactions with large momentum transfer a large contribution of etas is produced in secondary processes in the fsi .",
    "therefore , the absorption of etas from the primary production chain @xmath140 is balanced . for small photon energies",
    "@xmath141 gev this is even more obvious . due to the secondary contributions , which are not present in a calculation without fsi , the threshold is lowered down to energies of about 1.8 gev .",
    "it should be mentioned , that the absolute ( coherent ) threshold for this reaction is given by @xmath142 gev is located at much smaller photon energies .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines present the offshell calculation with and without fsi , including the modified @xmath34 decay widths .",
    "the calculation without fsi is enhanced compared to the onshell result by up to @xmath143% close to the maximum of the curve .",
    "similar to photoproduction , this increase is due to the width modification . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : xsection ] , also resonances with masses below the free @xmath2 threshold contribute now , this effect is stronger for large @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , there is a strong subthreshold effect caused by the groundstate correlations . in the full calculation with fsi ,",
    "the difference to the onshell counterpart becomes somewhat smaller .",
    "this is mainly due to the contribution of secondary processes at higher energies ( yielding approximately one half of all etas @xcite ) , which are essentially identical for the onshell and the offshell case .",
    "however , the remaining increase is larger than in photoproduction . in the threshold region ,",
    "the curves with and without fsi are close to each other , because there only etas from the primary reaction influenced by the groundstate correlations contribute .",
    "the difference to the solid onshell curve , however , is smaller than in the scenario without fsi , because the onshell threshold is strongly lowered by the fsi .",
    "we have calculated @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction on nuclei within the buu transport model .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we take into account that the nucleons are correlated in the nuclear groundstate and acquire a finite width due to collision reactions during the fsi .",
    "this has an influence on the kinematics of the elementary photon - nucleon reaction .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed how the possibility of a resonance decay into broad nucleons might modify the in - medium decay width of the @xmath1 .",
    "here we found strong deviations from the vacuum case in particular for large resonance momenta . combining all these issues together with the model for the offshell propagation developed in @xcite",
    ", we showed that there is indeed an influence on the @xmath0 production cross section on nuclei , which is more pronounced at large momentum transfer , i.e. in electron induced reactions at large @xmath37 . besides contributions below the threshold of the onshell calculations , an increase of the cross section for energies up to the maximum is observed .",
    "the model presented here is particularly suitable for an investigation of offshell effects on incoherent particle production yields . in particular , it could also be applied to reactions with high energy photons such as @xmath144 production on nuclei , where searches for color transparency phenomena have to rely on an accurate description of more involved , but nevertheless interesting effects .",
