    "the transition metals are among the most intensively studied families of elements , and there has been an effort going back several decades to map and interpret systematic trends in their properties .",
    "some of these trends are of fundamental importance to our understanding of the energetics and electronic structure of transition metals .",
    "examples include : the parabolic dependence of cohesive energy and bulk modulus on @xmath0-band filling ;  @xcite the sequence of most stable crystal structures associated with increasing band filling at ambient pressure ;  @xcite and the pressure induced increase of @xmath0-band width going roughly as the fifth inverse power of the atomic volume .",
    "@xcite however , our knowledge of transition - metal systematics is still very far from complete , as is evident from the current major controversies over high - pressure melting curves .",
    "@xcite even at low temperatures , there are sizable gaps in the map of transition - metal phase diagrams , and new crystal structures continue to be discovered .  @xcite we report here a systematic investigation of the zero - temperature phase diagram of all the 4@xmath0 transition metals over a wide range of pressures , based on one of the most accurate implementations of density functional theory ( dft ) currently available .",
    "there have , of course , been very many previous detailed studies of transition metals based on dft , some of which investigated the relative stability of different crystal structures at high pressures .",
    "however , most previous work has been designed to address particular questions relating to particular metals . here , by constrast ,",
    "the aim is to obtain a coherent overall view of an entire transition - metals series .",
    "specifically , using @xmath2 to denote atomic number , we wish to use dft to map out the generalized @xmath5 phase diagram of the 4@xmath0 series at @xmath6  k at pressures @xmath1 up to @xmath7  gpa  @xcite . in order to substantiate the accuracy of the calculations",
    ", we shall compare our calculated results for @xmath1 as a function of volume @xmath8 with all available experimental data .",
    "the calculations are all performed using the fp - lapw implementation of dft ( full - potential linearized augmented plane waves ) ,  @xcite which for a given exchange - correlation functional is among the most accurate ways of calculating the total energy .",
    "we use the exchange - correlation functional recently developed by wu and cohen ,  @xcite which appears to reproduce the experimental energetics of 4@xmath0 transition metals more accurately than other functionals .",
    "@xcite    there are several motivations for wishing to obtain the @xmath5 phase diagram of a transition - metal series at @xmath6  k. one motivation is the possibility of discovering hitherto unknown crystallographic phase boundaries for particular metals . another motivation is to probe our basic understanding of transition - metal energetics . at ambient pressure ,",
    "the most stable crystal structures of the 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 series follow the sequence hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) to body - centred cubic ( bcc ) to hcp to face - centred cubic ( fcc ) with increasing @xmath2 , and the 3@xmath0 series nearly follows this sequence , the deviations being caused by magnetic effects .",
    "@xcite this sequence is entirely explained by band energies , and can be reasonably well reproduced using a canonical @xmath0-band tight - binding model with some modifications due to hybridization with sp bands .",
    "@xcite the main effect of pressure is to shift the relative energies of the @xmath0-band centroid and the bottom of the @xmath4 band , and hence increase the @xmath0-band filling .",
    "@xcite this leads one to expect that the same sequence of structures will be found at high @xmath1 , but with the boundaries shifted to the left ( towards lower @xmath2 )  .",
    "@xcite we shall confirm that this is the case , though the reality is slightly more complicated .",
    "in addition to the motivations we have mentioned , there is another that is important to us .",
    "current controversies over the high - pressure melting curves of transition metals stem from apparent disagreements between melting temperatures deduced from static compression and shock experiments , these disagreements amounting to several thousand k at megabar pressures .",
    "@xcite dft calculations of transition - metal melting curves  @xcite support the correctness of the shock results , and one of the proposed resolutions of the conflicts is that the transitions identified as melting in static compression are in fact solid - solid transitions .",
    "it would clearly help to reduce the confusion if we had a better understanding of the generalized @xmath9 phase diagram of transition - metal series  @xcite . at present",
    ", we have a fairly complete knowledge of this only at low @xmath1 , and , to a lesser extent , at low @xmath10 .",
    "we see the present attempt to complete the low-@xmath10 @xmath5 diagram as an essential step towards mapping the full @xmath9 diagram .",
    "earlier dft work has already given much information about the energetics of transition metals at @xmath6  k. particularly important here is the work of pettifor  @xcite and others , which provided a systematic understanding of the structural trends across all the transition - metal series in terms of the electronic densities of states of different crystal structures .",
    "their work also gave important insights into the pressure induced transfer of electrons from sp - states to d - states .",
    "also important was the first - principles work of skriver  @xcite on structural trends across transition metal series at zero pressure .",
    "the pioneering work of moriarty , johansson and others on the high - pressure energetics of transition metals will be cited below .",
    "the information from all this previous work could be assembled to produce a substantial part of the @xmath5 diagram , but there would be inconsistencies from the use of different dft implementations and exchange - correlation functionals . here , we avoid such inconsistencies by using a single high - accuracy method for all the calculations .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : techniques ] , we summarize the essential ideas underlying the methods used in this work and the results of our convergence tests .",
    "then ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) , we present for each of the transition metals from y to pd our calculated energy differences between different crystal structures and the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath11 for pressures from ambient to @xmath7  gpa , comparing our results with experiments and previous calculations where possible . at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present the zero - temperature @xmath5 phase diagram of the 4@xmath0 transition - metal series .",
    "discussion and conclusions are in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "there are several implementations of dft that can be used to calculate the total energy per atom of a crystal , including pseudopotential techniques ,  @xcite the projector augmented wave technique ,  @xcite the full - potential augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) technique ,  @xcite etc .",
    "we have chosen to use fp - lapw here , because for a given exchange - correlation functional it can give values for the total energy that are closer to the exact value than most other implementations .",
    "there are a number of technical parameters in fp - lapw that control convergence towards the exact value .",
    "we recall in this section the main ideas of fp - lapw , summarize the parameters that control convergence , and report tests that guide our setting of these parameters .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional used for all the present work is that due to wu and cohen .",
    "@xcite later in this section , we outline briefly what this functional is , and we report tests indicating that it should be particularly accurate for present purposes .      in apw methods , space is divided into non - overlapping muffin - tin spheres ( radius @xmath12 ) centred on the atoms , and the interstitial region between the spheres .",
    "each kohn - sham orbital is represented as a sum of radial functions multiplied by spherical harmonics up to a maximum angular momentum @xmath13 in each sphere , and as a sum of plane waves ( maximum wavevector @xmath14 ) in the interstitial region ; the coefficients are adjusted to achieve continuity at the sphere boundaries .",
    "the kohn - sham eigenstates are divided into core and valence states ; core states are treated as being non - zero only inside the muffin - tin spheres , while valence states extend over all space .",
    "the radial functions used as basis sets are solutions of the schrdinger equation inside the atomic spheres , and are therefore energy dependent . in linearized apw ( lapw )",
    ", the energy dependence is treated in a linear approximation . in full - potential implementations ( fp - lapw ) ,",
    "the kohn - sham potential is also represented as a sum over angular momentum functions within the spheres ( maximum angular momentum @xmath15 ) and a sum over plane waves ( maximum wavevector @xmath16 ) in the interstitial region . as it stands , this scheme is not accurate if there are semi - core states , i.e. low - lying states that are not adequately treated by linearization .",
    "one solution to this problem is to linearize the basis functions using different reference energies for valence and semi - core states .",
    "alternatively one can augment the basis set with `` local orbitals '' , this procedure being known as the `` apw+lo '' method .",
    "we use the full - potential version of the latter method here in order to treat all the valence and semi - core states .",
    "a fully relativistic treatment is used for core states , and a scalar relativistic treatment for all other states .",
    "the wavevectors @xmath17 for which the kohn - sham equations are self - consistently solved must be sampled over the brillouin zone of the crystal , and the well - known monkhorst - pack @xmath18-point sampling scheme is used for this purpose .",
    "@xcite all the calculations were performed using the wien2k code .",
    "@xcite    throughout the present calculations , we aim to achieve convergence of the total energy to within 1  mev / atom with respect to all the parameters we have just mentioned .",
    "all states having principal quantum number @xmath19 are treated as core states , and all higher states as valence states .",
    "this choice is based on the fact that the states with @xmath20 lie at least 200  ev below the fermi level so they will not respond significantly to compression even at megabar pressures .",
    "provided the muffin - tin spheres do not overlap , and provided the calculations are fully converged with respect to all parameters , the choice of @xmath12 should not affect the results , but it does affect the efficiency of the calculations .",
    "we used the default setting of @xmath12 provided by the wien2k algorithm , which ensures that @xmath12 varies appropriately as the volume per atom is varied . to determine the settings required for the technical parameters @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 and @xmath21 , and for @xmath18-point sampling , we have conducted systematic tests on bcc , fcc and hcp mo",
    "; we assume that the settings that give the required accuracy for mo will also serve for all the 4@xmath0 transition metals in all the structures of interest .",
    "our tests on mo indicate that the choices @xmath22 , @xmath23  bohr@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , together with @xmath27 @xmath18-point sampling ( @xmath28 for hcp ) , give convergence to within @xmath3  mev / atom . to demonstrate that this is the case",
    ", we have set all of these parameters except one to the values just quoted , and studied the effect of varying the free parameter .",
    "the values of total energy per atom @xmath29 obtained when we vary in turn @xmath30 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath18-point sampling are reported in table  i  , from which we see that the required convergence is indeed achieved with the quoted values .",
    "these are the values used for all the calculations reported later .",
    "we note that , although we have paid careful attention to convergence , there remain small errors due to the linearization inherent in the fp - lapw scheme .",

    "we believe that work in which careful attention has not been give to convergence with respect to all technical parameters and the treatment of semi - core states must be regarded as less reliable .",

    "the resulting generalized phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ]  .     transition metals series .",
    "solid squares correspond to phase transitions obtained directly from the fp - lapw calculations while open squares show results obtained by interpolation ( see text ) . ]",
    "we noted in the introduction the general expectation that the sequence of crystal structures across a transition - metal series will be the same at high @xmath1 as at low @xmath1 , but that the phase boundaries should slope to the left ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the well - known ideas behind this expectation are that ( a )  the sequence of stable structures depends mainly on the band energy , i.e. the sum of single - electron energies ; ( b )  the band energy depends mainly on the @xmath0-band densities of states in the different crystal structures , and on the number of @xmath0-electrons ; ( c )  for given atomic number @xmath2 , increase of @xmath1 causes the bottom of the @xmath0-band to rise with respect to the @xmath0-band centroid , so that the effective number of @xmath0-electrons increases . because of this last effect , increase of @xmath1 should cause a given element to become more like its neighbour on the right .",
    "this is expected to be a stronger effect for early transition metals , since the increase of the effective number of @xmath0-electrons with compression is larger for them .",
    "@xcite    these expectations are confirmed most clearly by the major boundary separating bcc from more close - packed structures on the left of the phase diagram .",
    "this boundary causes zr at rather moderate pressures to adopt the low-@xmath1 structure of nb , and y to do the same at much higher pressures .",
    "however , the boundary separating bcc and hcp in the middle of the diagram is almost vertical up to @xmath60  gpa , and it is only at much higher pressures that it slopes to the left ; furthermore , it appears that mo never adopts the low-@xmath1 structure of its neighbour tc .",
    "similarly , the boundary between hcp and fcc on the right of the diagram is practically vertical up to @xmath45  gpa .",
    "dft predictions of the many transitions shown by y and zr already give evidence that dft provides reasonably good quantitative accuracy for the pressure dependence of band structures .",
    "the bcc - fcc transition in mo will probably remain out of reach of experiment for some time . on the controversial question of whether the high-@xmath1 transition in mo is really bcc - fcc or bcc - hcp ,",
    "our results support the former .",
    "the reason for this controversy is clearly that the hcp and fcc energies are very close to each other , so that the calculations have to be converged to high accuracy to yield reliable conclusions .",
    "we have taken pains to ensure that our prediction of bcc - fcc is robust with respect to all convergence parameters .",
    "consequently , we believe that the small and unexpected field of fcc at high @xmath1 and roughly half band filling is a real effect .",
    "the bcc - fcc transition in mo is relevant to the interpretation of the shock experiments mentioned in the introduction .",
    "when this transition was first studied theoretically , the predicted transition pressure was @xmath61  gpa ,  @xcite which is much lower than our value of @xmath62  gpa . at that time",
    ", it seemed likely that the transition is closely related to the transition seen in shock experiments  @xcite on mo at @xmath63  gpa and an ( estimated ) temperature of @xmath64  k. our confirmation of earlier work giving a much higher transition pressure makes it much less likely that there is a direct connection with the shock transition .",
    "the only way of maintaining this connection would be to postulate that the transition pressure decreases strongly with increasing temperature .",
    "however , our dft calculations of phonon frequencies in the two structures  @xcite show that the transition pressure actually _ increases _ with temperature , so that a direct connection with the shock transition is completely ruled out .",
    "turning now to detailed comparisons with experiment , we have shown that all our calculated equations of state @xmath11 agree very closely with experiment .",
    "the sequences of stable structures with increasing pressure are always correctly predicted , where experimental data are available , but our calculations have a clear tendency to underestimate transition pressures @xmath65 by typically @xmath66  gpa .",
    "this can be attributed to a relative shift @xmath67 of the energies of coexisting phases . since at @xmath6",
    "k , the enthalpies @xmath68 of coexisting phases are equal , a shift of @xmath31 is related to @xmath67 by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the enthalpies of the two phases . since @xmath72 , the shift @xmath73 can be estimated as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the coexisting volumes .",
    "then a shift @xmath77  gpa equates to a ratio @xmath78  mev / @xmath39  atom .",
    "taking an example , the volume change @xmath79 at the hcp-@xmath80 transition of zr was calculated to be @xmath81  @xmath39/atom , so it would require a relative shift of 6  mev / atom to account for the error in @xmath65  . on the other hand , for the @xmath80-bcc transition of zr , for which @xmath82  @xmath39/atom , the relative shift would have to be @xmath83  mev / atom .",
    "it is easy to see that room - temperature thermal effects are unlikely to be the cause . estimating the vibrational free energy per atom @xmath84 as @xmath85 , with @xmath86 the geometric - mean phonon frequency , a difference @xmath87 between coexisting phases causes a relative free energy shift @xmath88 . with @xmath89  mev at room temperature",
    ", unreasonably large @xmath90 values would be required . on the other hand ,",
    "we have cited evidence ( table  [ tab : zr ] ) that differences between density functionals can lead to @xmath65 shifts of order @xmath91  gpa in the @xmath80-bcc transition of zr .",
    "however , there is a third possible cause , namely errors of dft implementation .",
    "we have made efforts to ensure that our fp - lapw energies are converged to @xmath3  mev / atom with respect to plane - wave and angular - momentum cut - offs , but there remain possible linearization errors , whose size is difficult to estimate .",
    "it seems clear that implementation errors must be the reason for some of the very large differences between dft predictions of @xmath31 values .",
    "we think this explains the difference of over @xmath92  gpa in the predicted @xmath65 of the fcc - bcc transition in y ( table  [ tab : y ] ) , because the earlier dft work was done at a time when the treatment of semi - core states was less well developed .",
    "the range of @xmath93  gpa in predicted @xmath65 values for the high-@xmath1 transition in mo must also be attributed to implementation errors in early work .",
    "we conclude by recalling that the present calculations on the zero - temperature @xmath5 phase diagram are intended as a prelude to the systematic mapping of the @xmath9 diagram , including the solid - liquid coexistence surface as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in spite of major progress in the first - principles calculation of melting curves over the past 10 years ,",
    "@xcite the computation of the entire @xmath9 phase diagram is clearly a major challenge , which will need to be tackled in stages .",
    "the use of dft to calculate harmonic vibration frequencies  @xcite will allow quite rapid progress at temperatures up to about one third of the melting temperature , and we have already reported systematic calculations of this kind for fe , ta and mo over a wide range of pressures .",
    "@xcite for melting curves , several first - principles methods are available .",
    "@xcite however , we believe it will also be valuable to make rapid and more approximate surveys using tight - binding methods , and we plan to report on this approach in the near future .",

    "<S> we use an accurate implementation of density functional theory ( dft ) to calculate the zero - temperature generalized phase diagram of the 4@xmath0 series of transition metals from y to pd as a function of pressure @xmath1 and atomic number @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the implementation used is full - potential linearized augmented plane waves ( fp - lapw ) , and we employ the exchange - correlation functional recently developed by wu and cohen . for each element </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the ground - state energy for several crystal structures over a range of volumes , the energy being converged with respect to all technical parameters to within @xmath3  mev / atom . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated transition pressures for all the elements and all transitions we have found are compared with experiment wherever possible , and we discuss the origin of the significant discrepancies . agreement with experiment for the zero - temperature equation of state is generally excellent . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized phase diagram of the 4@xmath0 series shows that the major boundaries slope towards lower @xmath2 with increasing @xmath1 for the early elements , as expected from the pressure induced transfer of electrons from @xmath4 states to @xmath0 states , but are almost independent of @xmath1 for the later elements . </S>",
    "<S> our results for mo indicate a transition from bcc to fcc , rather than the bcc - hcp transition expected from @xmath4-@xmath0 transfer . </S>"
