    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite has two higgs doublets @xmath11 and @xmath12 that couple to fermions with weak isospin @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively @xcite . after spontaneous symmetry breaking ,",
    "there remain five physical higgs bosons : a pair of singly charged higgs bosons @xmath15 , two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath16 ( heavier ) and @xmath17 ( lighter ) , and a neutral cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath18 . the higgs potential is constrained by supersymmetry ( susy ) such that all tree - level higgs boson masses and couplings are determined by just two independent parameters , commonly chosen to be the mass of the cp - odd pseudoscalar ( @xmath19 ) and the ratio of vacuum expectation values of neutral higgs fields ( @xmath20 ) .    in the mssm and two higgs doublet models with model ii of yukawa interactions , the couplings of down type quarks and leptons with the neutral higgs bosons are proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "thus a large value of @xmath22 greatly enhances the production rate of higgs bosons produced in association with bottom quarks as well as the branching fraction of the rare decay @xmath0 mediated by neutral higgs bosons .    if @xmath23 , the mssm neutral higgs bosons are dominantly produced from bottom quark fusion @xmath24 @xcite at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . for a higgs boson produced along with one bottom quark at high transverse momentum ( @xmath25 ) ,",
    "the leading - order subprocess is @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "if two high @xmath25 bottom quarks are required in association with a higgs boson , the leading order subprocess should be @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "the lhc has a great potential to discover the inclusive muon pair channel for neutral higgs bosons of minimal supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "recently , it was found that the discovery channel with one energetic bottom quark @xcite greatly improves the discovery potential of the lhc beyond the inclusive channel without bottom quarks @xcite ( @xmath28 ) and the associated channel with two bottom quarks @xcite ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "since the atlas and the cms both have excellent muon mass resolution , this discovery channel will provide a good opportunity to reconstruct the higgs boson mass at the lhc with high precision .",

    "@xcite suggests @xmath35 with updated parameters .",
    "the current experimental upper limit is @xmath36 obtained by the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) and the @xmath37 collaborations @xcite . while this branching fraction is small in the sm , it could become large in supersymmetric models @xcite-@xcite and this rare decay provides a possible opportunity for the cdf and the 0 experiments to discover new physics in the near future .    in this letter , we investigate the discovery potential of the direct searches for the higgs bosons @xmath38 at the lhc and that of the indirect searches for higgs bosons in @xmath0 at the fermilab tevatron run ii within the framework of supersymmetric models .",
    "we make three major contributions : ( a ) studying the lhc discovery potential for @xmath38 in the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) and in supergravity models with non - universal higgs bosons masses at @xmath30 ( nuhm sugra ) , ( b ) evaluating @xmath39 in nuhm sugra models , and ( c ) comparing these two promising channels in the mssm , the msugra , and non - universal sugra models . in section ii , we discuss our strategies and results for the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",

    "( iv ) at the tree level , the ckm matrix is the only source for flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) , and ( v ) we include fcnc contributions from one - loop diagrams involving charginos and up - type squarks as well as gluino and down - type squarks .",
    "in addition , we adopt a common mass scale for supersymmetric ( susy ) particles and parameters @xmath98 , where @xmath99 are the trilinear couplings for the third generation .",
    "two values of @xmath100 are considered : ( a ) @xmath101 gev and ( b ) @xmath102 gev .    in figure 1 , we present the contours for the branching fraction in the mssm @xmath103 @xmath104 ( current experimental limit ) , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 as well as the discovery contours of @xmath8 for integrated luminosities of 30 fb@xmath6 and 300 fb@xmath6 at the lhc in the @xmath108 plane for two values of common masses : ( a ) @xmath109 gev , and ( b ) @xmath110 gev .    we note that for @xmath101 gev , the lhc will be able to discover @xmath38 with an integrated luminosity ( @xmath5 ) of 30 fb@xmath6 in a significantly large region of the parameter plane beyond @xmath111 .",

    "in this section , we consider both @xmath38 and @xmath0 in the minimal supergravity model and supergravity models with non - universal boundary conditions for the higgs boson masses at the grand unified scale ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we evolve supersymmetry masses and couplings from the grand unified scale using two - loop renormalization equations in isajet 7.72 @xcite to calculate mssm masses , mixing angles and couplings .",
    "the following theoretical requirements are imposed on the evolution of renormalization group equations : ( i ) radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is achieved ; ( ii ) the correct vacuum for ewsb is obtained ( tachyon free ) ; and ( iii ) the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is the lightest neutralino ( @xmath114 ) .      in the minimal supergravity ( msugra )",
    "model @xcite , supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector and susy breaking is communicated to the observable sector through gravitational interactions .",
    "the msugra parameters are chosen to be a scalar mass ( @xmath115 ) , a gaugino mass ( @xmath116 ) , a trilinear coupling ( @xmath117 ) , the sign of a higgs mixing parameter ( @xmath118 ) , and the ratio of higgs field vacuum expectation values at the electroweak scale ( @xmath119 ) .",

    "also shown are the parts of the parameter space ( i )  disfavored by theoretical requirements or ( ii )  excluded by the chargino search at lep 2 with @xmath123 gev .",
    "there are several interesting aspects to note in figure 2 .    *",
    "if @xmath124 , only a tiny region of the parameter space with small values of @xmath116 and @xmath115 will likely lead to observable signals for either @xmath0 at the tevatron run ii or @xmath8 at the lhc . * for @xmath125 , direct searches for @xmath8 at the lhc with @xmath112 fb@xmath6",

    "if @xmath127 , the discovery contour for @xmath8 at the lhc with @xmath112 fb@xmath6 is very close to the contour for @xmath126 in the msugra parameter space .",
    "in addition , both discovery channels at the lhc become complementary .",
    "the direct searches for @xmath8 with @xmath10 fb@xmath6 covers a significant region beyond the contour of @xmath128 .",
    "likewise , the rare decay with @xmath7 covers a large region beyond the discovery contour of the direct search for @xmath8 with @xmath10 fb@xmath6 .      in our analysis for non - universal supergravity models ,",
    "the gut - scale higgs masses are parameterized as @xmath129 the nonuniversality of higgs - boson masses at @xmath30 can significantly affect the values of higgs masses and couplings at the weak scale @xcite .",
    "we find that a decrease in @xmath130 with a negative @xmath131 as well as an increase in @xmath132 with a positive @xmath133 at @xmath30 will lead to a smaller mass at the electroweak scale for the higgs pseudoscalar ( @xmath18 ) or the heavier higgs scalar ( @xmath16 ) than that in the msugra model .",
    "therefore , we choose three sets of values for @xmath134 to study the discovery potential for detecting higgs bosons with muons in sugra models with non - universal higgs boson masses : ( i ) @xmath135 , ( ii ) @xmath136 , and ( iii ) @xmath137 .    in figure 3 ,",

    "<S> we investigate the prospects for the discovery of neutral higgs bosons with a pair of muons by direct searches at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) as well as by indirect searches in the rare decay @xmath0 at the fermilab tevatron and the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> promising results are found for the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model , and supergravity models with non - universal higgs masses ( nuhm sugra ) . for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ( i ) the contours for a branching fraction of @xmath2 in the parameter space are very close to the @xmath3 contours for @xmath4 at the lhc with an integrated luminosity ( @xmath5 ) of 30 fb@xmath6 , ( ii ) the regions covered by @xmath7 and the discovery region for @xmath8 with 300 fb@xmath6 are complementary in the msugra parameter space , ( iii ) in nuhm sugra models , a discovery of @xmath9 at the lhc will cover regions of the parameter space beyond the direct search for @xmath8 with @xmath10 fb@xmath6 . </S>"
