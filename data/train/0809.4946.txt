    "+ deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons off nucleons has been essential for our understanding of the structure of the nucleon .",
    "colliding electrons and positrons with protons , hera at desy has played a unique role in revealing details of the proton substructure of quarks and gluons . in june 2007",
    "the operation of hera was terminated after a period of 15 years of data taking . during this time the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera successfully operated their general purpose detectors which were adapted in 2001 to the luminosity upgrade of the collider interaction regions .",
    "both collaborations have published accurate measurements of @xmath0 dis cross sections based on about 120  @xmath1 of @xmath2 data collected until 2000  @xcite .",
    "these measurements have been crucial in substantially constraining the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the proton in global next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd fits  @xcite , which use fixed target data as well as hera data .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have both demonstrated their capability to extract complete sets of pdfs from their data alone  @xcite achieving a precision competitive to that obtained in the global qcd fits .",
    "aiming for the most accurate determination of pdfs , h1 and zeus are now working towards combining their datasets and joining their qcd analyses .",
    "+ the kinematics of lepton hadron scattering is described in terms of the variables @xmath3 , the four - momentum transfer squared of the exchanged vector boson , bjrken @xmath4 , the fraction of the momentum of the incoming nucleon carried by the struck quark ( in the quark - parton - model , qpm ) , and inelasticity @xmath5 , which is a measure of the energy transfered between the lepton and the nucleon . the differential cross section for the neutral current ( nc ) process , @xmath6 ,",
    "is given in terms of the structure functions by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fine structure constant , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the generalized nc proton structure functions which include @xmath13 boson exchange contributions .",
    "the structure functions @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath11 are directly related to quark distributions , and their @xmath3 dependence is predicted by perturbative qcd . the dominant contribution to the cross section is @xmath10 , which in turn is dominated by the electromagnetic structure function @xmath14 . in the qpm ,",
    "@xmath14  below the bottom mass threshold  can be written as @xmath15 + \\frac{1}{9}\\left[x(d + s + \\overline{d}+\\overline{s})\\right].\\ ] ] for low @xmath4 , @xmath16 , @xmath14 is dominated by the sea quarks , while its @xmath3 evolution is controlled by the gluon contribution .",
    "thus hera data provide crucial information on the low-@xmath4 sea - quark and gluon distributions . at high @xmath3 ,",
    "the structure function @xmath11 becomes increasingly important , and provides information on the valence quark distributions , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the charged current ( cc ) interactions , @xmath19 , provide additional flavor - type specific information to separate quark and anti - quark distributions at high-@xmath4 , since their ( leading - order ) cross sections are given by @xmath20 ^ 2 x\\left[(\\overline{u}+\\overline{c})+(1-y)^2(d+s)\\right],\\\\ \\frac{d^2\\sigma^-_{cc}}{dxdq^2 } & = & \\frac{g^2_f}{2\\pi x}\\left[\\frac{m_w^2}{q^2+m_w^2}\\right]^2 x\\left[(u+c)+(1-y)^2(\\overline{d}+\\overline{s})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 being the fermi coupling constant and @xmath22 the mass of the exchanged w boson .",
    "the @xmath0 nc and cc cross sections can thus be written completely in terms of up - type , @xmath23 , down - type , @xmath24 , and of anti - quark type , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , distributions .",
    "these ( anti-)quark type distributions can be determined from hera data alone .",
    "this has the advantage that there is no need for heavy target corrections , which must be applied to the @xmath27 and @xmath28 fixed target data used in the global fits .",
    "furthermore , there is no need to assume isospin symmetry , i.e. that @xmath29 in the proton is the same as @xmath30 in the neutron , since information on the @xmath29 distribution can be obtained directly from cc @xmath31 data .",
    "+ the h1 and zeus collaborations have both used their data to perform pdf fits  @xcite .",
    "both these data sets have small statistical errors , so that the contributions of systematic uncertainties become increasingly important and their proper treatment is essential .",
    "basically there are two approaches , the offset method used in the zeus analysis and the hessian method applied by the h1 analysis .",
    "the resulting zeus and h1 pdfs are compatible , although the gluon pdfs do have somewhat different shapes , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec]a .",
    "it is possible to improve on this situation by averaging the h1 and zeus datasets in a model - independent way prior to performing a qcd analysis on them .",
    "since both experiments measure the same cross section at a given kinematic point one can minimize the following @xmath32 and obtain a common true value at any measured kinematic point together with the correlated systematic shifts @xmath33 ^ 2}{\\delta^2_i } + \\sum_j\\frac{\\delta\\alpha^2_j}{\\delta^2_{\\alpha_j}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath34 is the measured central value , and @xmath35 the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainty of the quantity @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 are the values following from the minimization ; @xmath38 are parameters for the @xmath39 source of correlated systematic uncertainty and @xmath40 denotes the sensitivity of point @xmath41 to source @xmath42 . for the cross section measurements the index @xmath41 labels a particular measurement at a given @xmath43 .",
    "equation  [ eq : chi2:combine ] represents the correlated probability distribution function for the quantity @xmath37 and for the systematic uncertainty @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath32 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : chi2:combine ] is suitable for measurements in which the uncertainties are absolute or _ additive _ , i.e. do not depend on the central value of the measurement . for the cross section measurement , however , the correlated and uncorrelated systematic errors are proportional to the central values .",
    "this proportionality can be approximated by a linear dependence . in this case",
    "the combination of the data sets using eq .",
    "[ eq : chi2:combine ] has a bias towards lower cross section values since the measurements with small central values have smaller absolute uncertainties .",
    "an improved @xmath32 can be defined by replacing @xmath44 and@xmath45 which translates the relative or _ multiplicative _ uncertainties for each measurement to the absolute uncertainty .",
    "the correlated systematic uncertainties are floated coherently such that each experiment calibrates the other one .",
    "this allows a significant reduction of the correlated systematic uncertainty for much of the kinematic plane , as is shown in fig .",

    "the h1 and zeus data are found to be consistent , thus allowing to calculate the experimental uncertainties of the pdfs using the @xmath32 tolerance , @xmath48 .",
    "this represents a further advantage compared to those global fits where increased tolerances of @xmath49 had to be introduced to ensure that all input data sets are consistent with the result of the global fit at a 90% confidence level .",
    "+ qcd predictions for the structure functions are obtained by solving the dglap evolution equations at nlo in the @xmath50 scheme with the renormalization and factorization scales chosen to be @xmath3 .",
    "the dglap equations yield the pdfs at all values of @xmath3 provided they are input as functions of @xmath4 at some input scale @xmath51 . for our central fit",

    "a flavor decomposition of the ( anti- ) quark type into individual quark flavors can be achieved by assuming that the strange and charm quark at the input scale can be expressed as @xmath4 independent fractions , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , of @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively . imposing that @xmath74 as @xmath75 , a constraint implicit to global fits , further constrains @xmath76 .",

    "[ fig : pdfs ] ( labeled herapdf0.1 ) .",

    "the central fit , which in addition to all systematic sources of the combined data set , takes into account 4 sources of uncertainties from the combination procedure achieves an excellent @xmath47 of 477/562 . figure  [ fig : pdfs ] also compares the herapdf0.1 to recent global fits .",
    "note that the herapdf0.1 results employs new , still preliminary hera data of improved accuracy as discussed above .",
