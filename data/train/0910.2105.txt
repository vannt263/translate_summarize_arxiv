    "in this paper we study the generating function @xmath18 for the sequence of the moments m_i=_p^i(z)q(z)d z ,  i0 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are rational functions of one complex variable and @xmath4 is a curve in @xmath19 . in particular",
    ", we study conditions under which @xmath0 is a rational function , a polynomial , or an identical zero .",
    "the main motivation for such a study is the relation of the function @xmath0 with the classical center - focus problem of poincar .",
    "let @xmath20 @xmath21 be real - valued functions of @xmath22 analytical in a neighborhood of the origin in @xmath23 and vanishing at the origin together with their first derivatives .",
    "the poincar problem is to find conditions under which all solutions of the system \\ {    rcl & = & -y+f(x , y ) , + & = & x+g(x , y ) , +    . around zero",
    "are closed ( see e.g. the recent survey @xcite and the bibliography therein ) . despite the efforts of many researchers this problem remains open even in the case where @xmath24 and @xmath21 are polynomials of degree 3 , and any advances in its understanding are of a great interest .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath20 @xmath21 are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree , then one can construct another polynomials @xmath25 @xmath26 such that has a center if and only if all solutions of the trigonometric abel equation = f ( , ) r^2+g ( , ) r^3 with @xmath27 small enough are periodic on @xmath28 $ ] . in its turn , the trigonometric abel equation can be transformed by an exponential substitution into the equation = l(z)y^2 + m(z)y^3 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are laurent polynomials .",
    "furthermore , all solutions of with @xmath27 small enough are periodic on @xmath28 $ ] if and only if all solutions of with @xmath31 small enough are non - ramified along @xmath32 . by the analogy with system , if all solutions of with @xmath27 small enough are periodic on @xmath28 $ ] ( resp .",
    "if all solutions of with @xmath31 small enough are non - ramified along @xmath32 ) we will say that abel equation ( resp .",
    "abel equation ) has a center .    in the series of papers @xcite-@xcite the following modification of the center problem for equation",
    "was proposed : find conditions under which for any solution @xmath33 of the abel differential equation = p(z)y^2+q(z)y^3 with _ polynomial _ coefficients @xmath34 @xmath8 the equality @xmath35 holds whenever @xmath36 is small enough ( as above , in case if this condition is satisfied we will say that abel equation has a center ) .",
    "this modification seems to be easier than the initial problem at the same time keeping its main features , and in this context can be considered as a simplified form of the classical center - focus problem of poincar .",
    "the center problem for abel equation naturally leads to the following `` polynomial moment problem '' : find conditions under which polynomials @xmath37 @xmath8 satisfy the system _ 0 ^ 1p^i(z)q(z)d z=0 ,  i0 , or , in other words , find conditions implying the vanishing of the corresponding function @xmath0 .",
    "the center problem for abel equation is related to the polynomial moment problem in several ways .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite that for the parametric version @xmath38 of the `` infinitesimal '' center condition with respect to @xmath39 reduces to with @xmath40 on the other hand , it was shown in @xcite that `` at infinity '' ( under an appropriate projectivization of the parameter space ) the center condition for also reduces to .",
    "for other results relating the center problem for equation and the polynomial moment problem see @xcite and the bibliography therein",
    ".    posed initially as an intermediate step on the way to the solution of the poincar problem , the polynomial moment problem turned out to be quite subtle question unexpectedly related with such branches of mathematics as the galois theory and representations of groups .",
    "this problem has been studied in the papers @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite with the final solution achieved in @xcite , @xcite . before formulating the results of @xcite , @xcite",
    "explicitly let us introduce the following `` composition condition '' which being imposed on @xmath7 and @xmath41 implies both equalities and a center for .",
    "namely , suppose that there exist polynomials @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 such that the equalities 2 p(z)=p(w(z ) ) ,   q(z)=q(w(z ) ) ,  w(0)=w(1 ) hold .",
    "then changing the variable @xmath45 to @xmath44 and taking into account that for any path @xmath4 connecting @xmath46 and @xmath47 the path @xmath48 is closed , it is easy to see that equalities hold and abel equation has a center . furthermore , the main conjecture concerning the center problem for the abel equation (  the composition conjecture for the abel equation \" ) states that has a center if and only holds .    for many classes of @xmath7",
    "the composition condition turns out to be necessary for equalities to be satisfied .",
    "for instance , this is true if @xmath49 are not critical points of @xmath7 ( @xcite ) or if @xmath7 is indecomposable that is can not be represented as a composition of two non - linear polynomials ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , this is not true in general @xcite , and a right description of solutions of is as follows @xcite : non - zero polynomials @xmath37 @xmath8 satisfy if and only if @xmath41 can be represented as a _ sum _ of polynomials @xmath50 such that cc p(z)=p_j(w_j(z ) ) ,  q_j(z)=q_j(w_j(z ) ) ,  and  w_j(0)=w_j(1 ) for some polynomials @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that actually any solution of the polynomial moment problem may be obtained as a sum of at most two reducible solutions and that the corresponding reducible solutions may be described in a very explicit form .    in the same way",
    "as the center problem for abel equation leads to the polynomial moment problem , the center problem for equation leads to the following  laurent polynomial moment problem \" , which is the main motivation for investigations of this paper : describe laurent polynomials @xmath52 such that",
    "_ s^1 l^i(z)m(z ) d z= 0 ,   i0 .",
    "an analogue of condition in this setting is that there exist a laurent polynomial @xmath44 and polynomials @xmath53 @xmath54 such that the equalities l(z)=l(w(z ) ) ,  m(z)=m(w(z))w(z)hold . clearly , implies .",
    "furthermore , if for given @xmath14 there exist several such @xmath30 , then is satisfied for their sum .",
    "however , in distinction with the polynomial moment problem other mechanisms for to be satisfied also exist .",
    "for example , if @xmath55 for some @xmath56 , then the residue calculation shows that condition is satisfied for any laurent polynomial containing no terms @xmath57 with @xmath58    in addition to topics related to the poincar problem , the questions concerning the function @xmath0 appear also in other circumstances .",
    "let us mention for example the following particular case of the mathieu conjecture concerning compact lie groups @xcite proved by duistermaat and van der kallen @xcite : if all integral positive powers of a laurent polynomial @xmath14 have no constant term , then @xmath14 is either a polynomial in @xmath45 , or a polynomial in @xmath59 clearly , the assumption of this theorem is equivalent to the condition that the function @xmath0 for @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a constant . observe a delicate difference with the laurent polynomial moment problem : in the assumption of the theorem of duistermaat and van der kallen it is not required that integral in equals zero for @xmath63 . furthermore , the addition of such a condition would make the problem meaningless since for @xmath63 and @xmath64 integral in is distinct from zero for any non - zero @xmath65 notice also that the question about description of polynomials @xmath37 @xmath8 for which the function @xmath0 is equal to a constant , and not just to zero as in the polynomial moment problem , was recently raised by zhao @xcite in relation with his conjecture about images of commuting differential operators ( such a description is not an immediate corollary of the solution of the polynomial moment problem given in @xcite ) .    finally , observe that the classical wermer theorem @xcite , @xcite , describing analytic functions on @xmath32 satisfying _",
    "s^1h^i(z)g^j(z)g(z)d z=0 ,  i , j0,in the case where the functions @xmath13 are rational , obviously also is related to the subject of this paper . here , however , the assumption requires that an _ infinite _ number of functions @xmath66 @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 vanish simultaneously .",
    "notice that for rational @xmath70 and @xmath71 the wermer theorem is equivalent to the following statement @xcite : a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath72 @xmath71 to satisfy equalities is that there exist rational functions @xmath73",
    "@xmath74 @xmath75 such that h(z)=h(w(z ) ) ,   g(z)=g(w(z ) ) , and the curve @xmath76 is homologous to zero in @xmath77 with poles of @xmath78 and @xmath79 removed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we calculate an analytical expression for @xmath6 our approach here is similar to the one of @xcite ; however , in contrast to @xcite , we obtain an explicit analytical expression for @xmath0 .",
    "notice that formulas obtained imply in particular that if @xmath4 is closed , then @xmath0 is an algebraic function from the field @xmath80 generated over @xmath81 by the branches @xmath82 @xmath83 of the algebraic function @xmath84 inverse to @xmath7 , while if @xmath4 is non - closed , then @xmath0 is a linear combination of branches of the logarithm with coefficients from @xmath80 .",
    "another corollary is that if @xmath4 is closed and homologous to zero in @xmath77 with poles of @xmath7 removed , then the function @xmath0 is rational for _ any _ @xmath8 .",
    "following @xcite , if @xmath7 and @xmath4 satisfy the last condition we will say that _ poles of @xmath7 lie on one side of @xmath4_.    although the analytical expression for @xmath0 obtained in the second section is explicit , in general this expression by itself does not allow us to conclude whether @xmath85 is rational or vanishes identically , and the third section of the paper is devoted to these questions .",
    "we show that if poles of @xmath7 do not lie on one side of @xmath4 , then @xmath0 is rational if and only if the superpositions of the rational function @xmath86 with branches of @xmath84 satisfy a certain system of equations _",
    "i=1^nf_s , i()(p^-1_i(z))=0 ,  f_s , i ,  1sk , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 depend on @xmath7 and @xmath4 only .",
    "this result generalizes the corresponding criterion for polynomials given in @xcite and relies on the same ideas .",
    "in particular , we use combinatorial objects called  constellations \" ( similar to what is called  dessins denfants \" ) which represent the monodromy group @xmath89 of the algebraic function @xmath84 in a combinatorial way .    in the third section",
    "we also show that if @xmath7 and @xmath8 satisfy the conditions q^-1\\{}p^-1\\ { } ,  p()=,then the rationality of @xmath0 yields that @xmath90 notice that this result implies immediately the theorem of duistermaat and van der kallen cited above . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath14 is not a polynomial in @xmath45 or in @xmath91 , then for @xmath92 @xmath93 conditions are satisfied and therefore the equality @xmath94 would imply that @xmath95 in contradiction with the fact that for @xmath63 the integral in is not zero .",
    "besides , the mentioned result implies the following statement which gives the answer to the question of zhao : if integrals in vanish for all @xmath96 , then they vanish for all @xmath97 and therefore the polynomial @xmath98 is a sum of polynomials @xmath50 such that holds .    in the fourth section , using system and the characteristic property of permutational matrix representations of doubly transitive groups , we show that if @xmath7 is in generic position and poles of @xmath7 do not lie on one side of @xmath4 , then the function @xmath0 is rational if and only if the function @xmath8 has the form q(z)=q(p(z))p(z)for some rational function @xmath99 besides , we show that for @xmath7 as above a rational function @xmath8 satisfies @xmath100 if and only if holds for some rational function @xmath101 whose poles lie outside the curve @xmath102    in the fifth section we study conditions for vanishing of double moments for rational @xmath72 @xmath71 in a more general setting where the integration path is an arbitrary curve and the conditions @xmath11 @xmath103 may be weaker .",
    "we prove two results which precise and generalize the wermer theorem in the special case where @xmath72 @xmath71 are rational .    in the sixth section",
    "we obtain some preliminary results concerning the laurent polynomial moment problem .",
    "in particular , we deduce from the results of the fourth section its solution in the case where @xmath14 is in generic position .",
    "besides , we prove two generalizations of the theorem of duistermaat and van der kallen .    in the seventh section we study the following problem :",
    "how many first integrals in should vanish in order to conclude that all of them vanish . using the fact that the corresponding function @xmath0 is contained in the field @xmath104",
    ", we give a bound which depends on degrees of laurent polynomial @xmath14 and @xmath30 only .",
    "finally , the eighth section is devoted to relations between the condition that @xmath0 is rational and the condition that there exist rational functions @xmath105 @xmath106 , @xmath44 such that @xmath107 and p(z)=p(w(z ) ) ,  q(z)=q(w(z))w(z)(notice that is a particular case of where @xmath108 and @xmath109 , while , without the requirement @xmath110 , is equivalent to for @xmath111 ) .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in conditions which imply that for given @xmath7 and @xmath4 such that poles of @xmath7 do not lie on one side of @xmath4 , the rationality of @xmath0 implies that holds for some @xmath105 @xmath106 , and @xmath44 with @xmath107 . using a general algebraic result of girstmair",
