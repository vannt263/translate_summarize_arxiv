    "anomalous weak diboson production at lepton@xcite and hadron@xcite colliders has been a topic of considerable interest because of its potential for exhibiting physics beyond the standard model at the tev scale . in particular , non - standard physics",
    "may modify tri - boson couplings , yielding enhanced production of two electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "modifications of the tri - boson couplings change the balance of purely longitudinally polarized final state bosons , purely transverse , and mixed polarization final states .",
    "extracting vector boson polarizations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be a challenge .",
    "our purpose here is to explore the enhancement of @xmath5 via their lepton decay modes in models with heavy vector boson intermediate states with couplings to longitudinal gauge bosons at the lhc .",
    "longitudinal weak boson enhancement is accomplished here with the introduction of a spin - one , isospin - one resonance ( @xmath6 ) such as the technirho ( @xmath7 ) that occurs in technicolor models @xcite .",
    "technicolor offers an alternative model to the standard model high energy behavior which is dominated by transverse gauge boson production .",
    "the enhancement of the cross section of longitudinal weak boson pairs comes because of @xmath8-channel production of technirho particles .",
    "we look at the charged technirho @xmath9 and its generalization to @xmath10 @xcite . the advantage of this channel over the neutral channel : @xmath11 is that the neutral channel is plagued by the qcd background coming from @xmath12 .",
    "compelling technicolor models which can account for mass generation in the fermion as well as the gauge boson sector are difficult to construct .",
    "we look at generic features of the coupling of a spin - one isospin - one vector boson which in a certain limit corresponds to the minimal technicolor model with one su(2 ) doublet of technifermions that transforms in the fundamental representation of the su(@xmath13)@xmath14 gauge group @xcite . in all of our calculations ,",
    "we assume that the direct coupling of @xmath6 to fermions is negligible . direct couplings to fermions",
    "would only improve our calculated signal rates .",
    "early analyses of vector boson production at high energy hadron colliders were done by eichten , hinchliffe , lane and quigg @xcite , chanowitz and gaillard @xcite and chivukula @xcite . later work on hadron collider production of @xmath15 includes refs .",
    "these analyses focused on vector boson distributions or a limited range of parameter space , including decays to leptons . here",
    ", we include correlated gauge boson decays to leptons .",
    "we focus on the extent to which enhanced longitudinal boson production can be detected for a range of parameters which include the parameters of the minimal technicolor model .",
    "in addition to evaluating transverse mass distributions , we also exhibit rapidity correlations .",
    "we find that the lhc has a limited range in parameter space for which heavy vector boson production will be clearly distinguishable from the standard model . already by masses of 1.4 tev , the minimal technicolor model is inaccessible with @xmath1 pb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity .",
    "we show that rapidity correlations will be a useful tool auxiliary to transverse mass distributions in the exploration of enhanced ll gauge boson pair production . in the next section",
    "we outline the parameters of the heavy vector boson models and the changes to the matrix elements required . in section",
    "iii we describe our results , followed by our conclusions in section iv .",
    "a strongly - interacting symmetry breaking sector can be described in terms of an effective lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath6 particles are not fundamental particles , but composites of strongly interacting fermions .",

    "we generically represent the heavy vector resonance by @xmath42 .",
    "we now turn to the matrix element squared .    as a consequence of the strongly interacting sector , the @xmath15 can mix with @xmath18 , and in @xmath8-channel interactions , enhance longitudinal gauge boson production as the parton invariant mass squared @xmath8 approaches @xmath43 . in the process",

    "baur , han and ohnemus @xcite have shown that the next - to - leading order standard model distributions for @xmath45 production for quark - antiquark annihilation closely follow the leading order results in the @xmath47 jet case , where a jet requires @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 @xcite .",

    "this is the conventional vector meson dominance ( vdm ) form accounting for @xmath58 mixing .",
    "vector boson scattering occurs in the standard model , however , it is not as large as @xmath46 production of @xmath45 at the lhc .",
    "the fusion of @xmath59 and @xmath0 intermediate states create @xmath0 final states . using the improved vector boson approximation @xcite which is a good representation of the perturbative process @xmath60 @xcite , kuss and nuss @xcite",
    "have shown that the vector boson scattering contribution to @xmath61 between @xmath62 invariant masses of 0.5 tev-2.0 tev and pseudo - rapidity cuts of 2.5 is between 10 - 20% of the quark - antiquark annihilation contribution .",
    "the evba in the leading log approximation does well for the longitudinal scattering @xcite .",
    "consequently , we only consider vector boson scattering contributions involving longitudinal vector bosons in both the initial and final states in the case of enhanced couplings in the leading log approximation of the evba .    using a generalized model of chiral coupling to vector mesons , the longitudinal matrix element is @xcite @xmath63 in terms of mandelstam variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are combinations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 momenta .",
