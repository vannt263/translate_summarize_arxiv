    "the neutrons are released under radiative conditions during the interpulse phase .",
    "the necessary amount of @xmath1 is produced if protons and @xmath2 can partially mix at the core - envelope interface .",
    "this may happen after tp during the dredge - up phase during which a fraction of intershell material is carried into the envelope .",
    "the required extra - mixing is still uncertain . with the h/@xmath2-ratio decreasing continuously from a few hundred in the envelope to zero in the intershell both a @xmath1 as well as a @xmath3 pocket forms .",
    "herwig ( 2000 ) has described models with hydrodynamical , diffusive overshooting that leads to a partial mixing zone .",

    "these quantities change with the pulse number , typical numbers in low mass stars are @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the factor @xmath23 describes the effect of the overlapping of the he - flash convection zone in subsequent thermal pulses and can be estimated to be @xmath24 ( see herwig etal .",
    ", 2003 for details ) .",
    "we may assume that not more than 20 thermal pulses with dredge - up contribute to the envelope enrichment with material ( @xmath25 ) .    by evaluating eq.([math : mix ] ) for the numbers specified above we can derive a logarithmic expression that relates the average  overabundance in the pm zone with the mass of that zone : @xmath26}}}_{{\\mathrm { pm } } } + c\\ ] ] where",

    "the partial mixing zone should not extend into the he - shell .",
    "this puts a lower limit on [ s / fe]@xmath31 and thus on the neutron exposure in the partial mixing zone . in fig.[fig : tau - shsls ] the dashed horizontal line corresponds to @xmath32 and @xmath29 , and according to eq.([gl : sfe - mpm ] ) [ s / fe]@xmath31 above that line are allowed . from [ hs / ls]@xmath33 ( dotted line )",
    "it follows that the neutron exposure should not exceed @xmath34 in the partial mixing zone .",
    "otherwise the envelope  abundance distribution will eventually be top - heavy as well , and not in agreement with observations ( lugaro etal . , 2003 ) .",
    "thus , we estimate that the neutron exposure at the end of the interpulse phase should be in the range @xmath35 . using eq.([gl : sfe - mpm ] ) and @xmath28}}}_{{\\mathrm { pm } } } = 4.0 $ ] at the upper @xmath36 limit , the mass of the partial mixing zone should obey @xmath37 ( assuming @xmath25 ) .",
    "these estimates are roughly in agreement with the much more detailed analysis of the partial mixing zone by gallino etal .",
    "rotation induces mixing in stars through a variety of processes ( maeder & meynet , 2000 ) . in rotating agb stars a large angular velocity gradient develops at the interface of the compact and fast rotating core and the slow rotating envelope . for our analysis",
    "we take the corresponding mixing efficiencies and thermodynamic input from a 3@xmath39 stellar model sequence including rotation ( langer etal . , 1999 ) .",
    "these models predict that shear mixing is continuously present at the core - envelope interface throughout the interpulse phase . for the  the effective",
    "lagrangian mixing efficiency is important .",
    "note , that the partial mixing layer is contracting significantly during the interpulse phase . around the time of @xmath9 ignition ( interpulse phase @xmath40 )",
    ", the diffusion coefficient is @xmath41 , which gives for a mixing timescale of @xmath42 a mixing range of @xmath43 .",
    "we use our _ nuclear network and mixing post - processing _ code to evaluate the effect of mixing on the .",
    "this code solves simultaneously for mixing processes and all considered nuclear processes ( charged particle reactions , neutron captures and @xmath6-decays ) . in the network",
    "all relevant charged particle reactions from hydrogen to @xmath44 have been considered with rates mainly taken from angulo etal .",
    "neutron captures for 15 light isotopes and 9 iron group species have been considered and most cross sections are from bao etal .",
    "the neutron capture on species beyond @xmath45 are considered by a two step heavy neutron sink .",
    "we introduce two artificial particles ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) with two extra reactions ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) which together give an estimate on  efficiency . for the maxwellian",
    "averaged neutron capture cross section of @xmath46 we take @xmath50 , which has been determined from extensive one - zone model tests with a full network .    in fig.[fig : rot - prof ] we show the abundance profiles around the core boundary at two times of the post - processing calculation of one interpulse phase of the model sequence with rotation .",
    "the top panel shows the initial condition where rotationally induced mixing has caused some diffusion of protons into the @xmath2 rich core at the end of the ( in this case shallow ) third dredge - up .",
    "goriely & mowlavi ( 2000 ) have shown that in such a situation of a continuously decreasing proton abundance profile into the @xmath2 rich core the mass range with a proton abundance of @xmath51 will eventually host  enriched material . according to this criterion , and given the required properties of the partial mixing zone as estimated in the previous section the partial mixing zone obtained in this rotating model is too thin .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[fig : rot - prof ] shows the situation when neutrons are beginning to be released by the @xmath9 reaction . in models without rotation , where the partial mixing zone results for example from hydrodynamic overshooting , the @xmath3 and the @xmath1 pocket keep mainly separated . with rotation instead",
    "the @xmath3 abundance exceeds that of @xmath1 in the entire partial mixing zone .",
    "@xmath3 is an efficient neutron absorber , most notably through the @xmath52 reaction .",
    "the recycling effect of the protons released in this reaction and the subsequent @xmath53 reaction does not balance the poison effect of @xmath3 . as a result the neutron densities are low and the final maximum neutron exposure is much lower ( @xmath54)than our estimates from the previous section require .",
    "it seems that current models of rotation in agb stars predict interpulse mixing coefficients that could inhibit the  during the interpulse phase due to dilution of the @xmath1 pocket and admixture of the neutron poison @xmath3 . in order to further study the effect of mixing during the interpulse we have constructed some parametric  models assuming a constant diffusive mixing coefficient @xmath55 in lagrangian",
    "coordinates during the interpulse phase .",
    "we start in all cases with abundance profiles at the core - envelope interface shaped by hydrodynamic overshooting as described in herwig ( 2000 ) .",
    "the final neutron exposure at the end of the interpulse phase is shown in fig.[fig : mr - tau ] for several cases .",
    "the case without mixing shows a larger neutron exposure than allowed according to the estimates in @xmath56[sec : obs - pm ] for the cases with constant @xmath55 we find an anti - correlation of mixing efficiency and final neutron exposure .",
    "mixing coefficients over a range of two orders of magnitude correspond to a large spread of neutron exposure . for larger mixing efficiencies",
    "the pocket containing  enriched material becomes broader .",
    "however , the mixing coefficients that reproduce neutron exposures estimated in @xmath56[sec : obs - pm ] are much smaller than what is predicted by the full stellar evolution model with rotation .",
    "we attempt to attribute this to unaccounted processes of angular momentum transport like magnetic fields ( see heger etal . , these proceedings ) in the agb models .",
    "the simple parametric models indicate a possible solution for the apparent spread in  efficiency reported from pre - solar grains ( lugaro etal .",
