    "the astronomical community has always dedicated special attention to the growth of graphical and visualization tools , driving their evolution or even being directly involved in the development of many of them .    at present ,",
    "the most popular software for astronomers can be subdivided into two main categories : tools for image display and processing and tools for plotting data .",
    "notable among the former are iraf , by noao ; eso - midas , by the european southern observatory ; saoimage , by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and gaia , by eso .",
    "many other tools are available , but we refer to dedicated surveys for a complete list .",
    "gnuplot and supermongo are popular applications adopted for 2d data plots . a more sophisticated solution is represented by idl , by itt visual information , which is characterized by a large library of functions specifically developed for astrophysics .",
    "again , for a complete list , we refer to specific surveys .    among the most popular n - body visualization codes used by the community",
    "there are : tipsy , motivated by the need to quickly display and analyze the results of n - body simulations , it is mainly limited to this type of data ; paraview , produced by kitware in conjunction with the advanced computing laboratory at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) , the goal of the project is to develop scalable parallel processing tools with an emphasis on distributed memory implementations ; idl , mentioned above , contains support for n - body data display , but is not free software .",
    "a new generation of graphic software tools is now emerging .",
    "these tools are designed to overcome the limits and the barriers of traditional software by exploiting the latest technological opportunities .",
    "the main challenges and objectives are the following :    * high performance and multi threading , in order to exploit multi - core systems , large memories and powerful graphic cards and co - processors .",
    "this allows the user to handle large amount of data in real - time . *",
    "interoperability , allowing different applications , each specialized in doing different things , to interact with each other in a coordinated and effective way according to well - defined protocols .",
    "the aim is to provide to the user a complete suite of tools to best analyze his / her data .",
    "huge , monolithic and often inefficient tools are obsolete . *",
    "collaborative work .",
    "the tools allow several users to work on the same data at the same time from different places , exchanging experience , information and expertise . *",
    "access to distributed resources , via web services and/or grid protocols .",
    "often , data can no longer be moved from data centres as it is too large and complex .",
    "the astronomer must have the tools to access it , independently of his geographical location in a fast and reliable way .",
    "tools like visivo , aladin @xcite and topcat @xcite , have been recently developed in the framework of the virtual observatory ( www.ivoa.net ) to achieve all or some of these goals . in this paper",
    "we will focus in particular on visivo , which stands for visualization interface for the virtual observatory .",
    "visivo is being developed as a collaboration between the italian national institute for astrophysiscs ( inaf ) - astrophysical observatory of catania and cineca ( the largest italian academic high performance computing centre ) in the framework of the fp6 eu funded vo - tech project .",
    "the next section gives a short review of the basic functionality of visivo , while section 3 describes plastic , a messaging protocol which allows heterogeneous applications to work together .",
    "part of section 3 and section 4 are dedicated to presenting several scientific cases in which the support of graphics and visualization is of primary importance . in these sections",
    "we show some of visivo s capabilities in action , demonstrating how they can be effectively used in practical applications .",
    "visivo is a c++ application specifically designed to deal with multidimensional data .",
    "it is free software available both for ms windows and for gnu / linux ( porting to macos is in progress ) .",
    "it can be downloaded from the web site http://visivo.cineca.it .",
    "the software is built on the top of the multimod application framework ( maf)@xcite . maf is an open source framework for the development of data visualization and analysis applications .",
    "it provides high level components that can be easily combined to develop a vertical application .",
    "it is being developed by the visualization group of cineca and it can be downloaded from the web site http://openmaf.cineca.it .",
    "the framework is based on the visualization toolkit ( vtk ) @xcite library for the multidimensional visualization and on the wxwidgets library , a portable open source gui library , for the user interface .",
    "it incorporates other open libraries , ( for example for data encryption ) or drivers for virtual reality devices ( 3d mouse , gloves , haptics etc . ) .",
    "visivo s architecture strictly reflects the structure of a typical scientific application built with the maf , being mainly developed in the highest layers of the framework .",
    "the software exploits , wherever possible , the standard visualization services , views , operations and interface structures provided by the framework and implements all the elements that are specific to the visualization and analysis of astronomical data .",
    "extensions to the basic maf infrastructure have been developed in order to match astronomy - specific requirements and to provide the highest performance .",
    "internal data representation is in the form of a _ table data _ structure , which is composed of a sequence of variables loaded from a data source such as a file or a database .",
    "regardless their original type , variables are all converted to _",
    "double _ format .",
    "while this incurs a penalty in the application s memory needs , it provides the necessary precision in some of the data processing stages . once a table is loaded the user can manage and visualize the data .",
    "these operations do not increase the memory usage as long as they do not create new tables or new fields : the visualization process is carried out using references to the table data with no data replication . in order to visualize data ,",
    "the user has to set which of the loaded fields will be used as the coordinate system of a cartesian reference frame . in this way",
    ", the software ensures maximum flexibility in data usage .",
    "data visualization is the main target of visivo .",
    "the software is designed to simultaneously handle as many properties as possible .",
    "complex tables can be loaded and manipulated , new fields can be derived and finally represented graphically , using points , colours , transparencies , surfaces , glyphs and volume rendering",
    ". the first step of a working session is usually data loading .",
    "data can be read from files ; visivo supports different kinds of file formats : standard file formats , like votables , fits , hdf5 , ascii , raw binaries and the native data format of the popular @xmath0 simulation code @xcite .",
    "the votable format is an xml standard for the interchange of astronomical data , defined by the international virtual observatory alliance ( ivoa , http://www.ivoa.net ) .",
    "data is represented as a set of tables , each table being an unordered set of rows , whose format is specified in the table xml metadata .",
    "rows are sequences of table cells , each containing either a primitive data type or an array of such primitives .",
    "votables can also contain links to external files as a separate data source .",
    "visivo uses the savot votable parser developed by cds to load and write votables .",
    "fits and hdf5 importers are implemented using the published api and libraries .",
    "the ascii table format consists of columns of data spaced with the most common separation characters ( space , tab etc . ) .",
    "raw files are sequences of variables written as binary dumps of the memory . the binary files can be managed by descriptor files which store the associated information ( number of variables , data types etc . ) .",
    "visivo can also interact with cds vizier data service @xcite , retrieving data directly from remote archives ( see par .",
    "2.3 ) .",
    "once data is loaded it can be visualized and analyzed .",
    "visivo can deal with both structured and unstructured data .",
    "the former is represented by fields defined on a regular mesh .",
    "the latter is data with no special geometry ; it is treated as sets of points .",
    "graphically , unstructured data have a default representation as pixels .",
    "the points geometrical distribution is set by selecting three of the fields loaded as table data .",
    "for example : the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 coordinates of the particles from a n - body simulation , or the ra ( right ascension ) - de ( declination ) - vmag ( johnson magnitude v ) fields for data from stellar catalogues ( figure [ fg1 ] ) .",
    "besides their geometric position , points can be used to display further quantities , using colours and glyphs ( 3d shapes , like spheres or cubes ) .",
    "points can be coloured as a function of a given scalar field ( e.g. their temperature or their spectral index ) with a colourmap that the user can customize .",
    "each point can also have an associated glyph , whose size can be a function of one ( for spheres ) or two ( for cubes , cylinders , pyramids ) fields .",
    "a vector quantity can be visualized as well , using either oriented segments or arrows .",
    "vectors can also be coloured according to their magnitude .",
    "if the data size is too large to be managed in memory , visivo allows the user also to extract a random subset of points .",
    "it is also possible to select the points which lie in a region the user is specifically interested in ( e.g a galaxy cluster in a cosmological simulation , or a globular cluster in a catalogue of stars ) .",
    "the selection can be accomplished using either a rectangular sampler or the cluster finder utilities . for the latter ,",
    "the following cluster identification method is implemented . a field associated to the points ( e.g. the point mass )",
    "is used to set a threshold .",
    "all the points that have a value of the field above the threshold , comprise a cluster .",
    "surfaces which divide regions above and below the threshold can be visualized ( see figure [ fg2 ] ) .",
    "regions geometrically disjoint ( i.e. their threshold surfaces do not overlap ) are identified as separate clusters .        structured mesh - based data",
    "do not have a default graphical representation .",
    "visivo can visualize them using volume rendering and isosurface .",
    "volume rendering is a visualization technique in which the field values are represented by different colours and different transparencies .",
    "the global effect is a cloud appearance .",
    "this method enables the user to emphasize also the inner parts of the volume .",
    "isosurfaces are surfaces of given value calculated from a mesh - based quantity .",
    "the isosurface can be defined as the surface which divides regions in which a given field has value above a certain value from regions in which it is below that value .",
    "visivo provides various built - in utilities that allow the user to perform mathematical operations and to analyze data .",
    "it is possible to apply algebraic and mathematical operators to the loaded data .",
    "basic arithmetic operations ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , division ) as well as logarithm , power law , absolute value and many others are supported .",
    "scalar product , magnitude and norm of vector quantities are available too . in this way",
    ", new physical quantities can be calculated .",
    "for example , for the gas distribution of a simulated galaxy cluster , the x - ray emission due to thermal bremsstrahlung can be calculated as proportional to the product of the square of the mass density and the square root of the temperature of the gas .",
    "if these two quantities are available , the emission can be immediately derived .",
    "it is also possible to merge two different table data structures to create a new one .",
    "data in the resulting table can be treated as a single dataset .",
    "the merging capabilities and the mathematical operations give great flexibility in data analysis and representation .",
    "+ several built - in functions allow the user to perform a statistical analysis of a points distribution .",
    "+ the * scalar distribution * function calculates the distribution of any quantity loaded in the table data and plots it as a histogram . +",
    "the * correlation filter * calculates the linear two - point correlation function of a point set .",
    "this is defined as the probability @xmath4 of finding a point in a randomly - chosen volume @xmath5 and a point in another volume @xmath6 separated by a distance @xmath7 .",
    "the two - point correlation function of visivo is based on the 3d counterpart of the _ peebles & hauser _ estimator @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of points in an auxiliary random sample , @xmath10 is the number of all pairs of points with separation inside the interval @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 is the number of pairs between the data and the random sample with separation in the same interval .",
    "the random sample must have a density @xmath13 times the density of the real dataset .",
    "the box is divided into a number @xmath14 of cubic subintervals .",
    "then a frequency histogram of the pair distances of particles is constructed .",
    "the calculation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is performed with a monte carlo integration .",
    "+ the fourier transform of the correlation function is represented by the * power spectrum * , which can be estimated by visivo as well .",
    "the power spectrum of a set of n massive particles can be calculated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the power spectrum , @xmath19 is the three dimensional wave number : @xmath20 , with @xmath21 indicating the i - th component of the spatial position of a point and @xmath22 is the fourier transform of the mass density field .",
    "the power spectrum provides the same statistical information of the correlation function , but it is much faster to compute .",
    "however , in the present implementation , periodic boundary conditions are required . furthermore , in general , the spatial resolution is worse than that of the correlation function .",
    "in fact , in order to calculate the power spectrum , a cloud in cells algorithm distributes a constant value for each point ( its mass ) on a regular structured mesh with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the mesh resolution sets the maximum wave number that the power spectrum can be calculated on . with this procedure ,",
    "a mesh based mass density distribution is reconstructed and a fast fft based approach can be used to estimate @xmath18 .",
    "+ the last available analysis tool is for * minkowski functionals * ( _ mfs _ ) .",
    "they describe the geometry , the curvature and the topology of a point - set @xcite . in a three - dimensional euclidean space ,",
    "these functionals have a direct geometric interpretation .",
    "the first functional represents the volume @xmath23 of a structure , the second one represents the surface area @xmath24 and it is a measure of the geometry of the distribution .",
    "the third functional corresponds to the integral mean curvature @xmath25 of the structure s surface .",
    "it represents a measure of the distribution topology .",
    "algorithm implemented in visivo associates a _ covering sphere _ of radius @xmath7 to each data point .",
    "the size , the shape and the connectivity of the spatial pattern , composed by the union - set of the spheres , change with the radius , which can be used as a diagnostic parameter . in particular , visivo computes the reduced values of the minkowski functionals , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , that are the ratio of the _ mfs _ of the actual distribution to the _ mfs _ of the same number of disjointed convex bodies .",
    "their values always start from unity : for small radii , all the covering spheres are disjointed . in the 3rd functional @xmath28 ,",
    "the first zero provides an estimate of the percolation threshold .",
    "a spongy structure , like a poisson distribution , gives lower values for @xmath28 , while higher values indicate structures with few big filaments or tunnels .      in the age of the virtual observatory",
    ", data collections are distributed between various sites .",
    "they are accessible to user applications via standard technologies such as the web service wsdl / soap protocol .",
    "one of the services exploiting this web service technology is vizier , version 2 of which is available on the cds servers .",
    "although it is still in beta , the service will also be available at ads , adac and cadc after the final release .",
    "vizier is a database which archives , in an homogeneous way , thousands of astronomical catalogues gathered over decades by the cds and participating institutes .",
    "the new web service interface gives access to the vizier database of astronomical catalogues by adding four new methods to the old interface :    * conecatalogs * coneresults * adqlrequest * getavailability    visivo , using the axis c / c++ library , implements an interface to the service .",
    "it is able to get the list of available servers using the getavailability method , to get the list of valid parameters values to pass to the conecatalogs and coneresults and using the last two methods to get metadata and data ( in votable format ) about catalogues depending on the given parameters .",
    "+ in this way , visivo is able to query directly the vizier web service to retrieve data from it and visualise them as if they were local data .",
    "the interaction with the service is transparent to the user .",
    "the user need only fill in specified fields with the parameters defining the data he wants to download .",
    "the result of this operation is a list of catalogues and , on selecting one of them , data can be visualised as if they were in a file or saved on the disk in the votable format .",
    "visivo s recommended system requirements are such that it can be used on a consumer laptop personal computer .",
    "visivo s performance is mainly constrained by the system ram size ; each loaded file will create a sequence of float arrays : the more memory the user has on his system the more data he can load . on a laptop with 1 gb of ram running a gnu / linux system , visivo is able to load and handle 2 million points interactively , while up to 16 million points can be loaded in about 5 seconds , although the visualization then becomes quite slow .",
    "on microsoft windows xp , visivo is limited to 8 million points due to windows memory management .    table 1 shows the execution time in seconds of typical operations the user performs with visivo .",
    "the test were carried out both with gnu / linux systems and microsoft windows xp ( the column names containing gl and mw letters respectively ) and ati mobility radeon x600 with 64 mb and ati radeon xpress 1100 graphics cards .",
    "the 16 m and 8 m letters identify tests with sixteen and eight million row datasets respectively .",
    "hps identifies our high performance dual processor system equipped with two amd opteron dual core 280 ( 2.4ghz ) , 8 gb of ram and a 7200rpm sata hard disk .",
    "lap1 and lap2 identify two consumer laptops , lap1 is equipped with an intel pentium m 740 ( 1.73ghz ) , lap2 is equipped with an amd turion tl50x2 ( 1.6ghz ) , both have 1 gb of ram and 5400rpm hard disks .",
    "the import test consists of loading a binary file containing six fields , the geometry test consists of defining a 3d point distribution from three of the loaded fields , the display test consists of visualizing the geometry and the distribute test consists of distributing a scalar value associated to the sixteen million points on a regular grid with @xmath29 cells .",
    "the power spec .",
    "test computes the power spectrum of the point distribution and the correlation test computes the correlation function of the point distribution .",

    "the capabilities of visivo are extendable through an application interoperability protocol called plastic @xcite ( platform for astronomy tool interconnection ) .",
    "equally , through plastic , visivo s functionality is made available to other applications .",
    "+ the motivation for plastic is the desire to leverage the abilities of different desktop applications in a seamless way .",
    "scientific applications such as visivo are being continuously enhanced with new features and while this is of great benefit to users , there are some limitations to this",
    " bigger is better  approach .",
    "inevitably there will be some overlap between the applications feature sets as users demand capabilities from other applications in their own favourite tool , leading to a duplication of effort within the scientific software community .",
    "as applications become more powerful their resource footprint usually expands , and their increased complexity may make them more difficult to maintain and to use .",
    "+ the alternative and complementary approach is to encourage collaboration between applications , each a specialist in a particular task .",
    "this approach enables the user to assemble a suite of tools according to his personal requirements . exporting and outsourcing functionality to other applications has been explored by cds : aladin @xcite exposes a publicly documented interface (  voapp  ) that makes it possible for third - parties to write plug - ins @xcite that expand aladin s capabilities and reuse its functionality .",
    "however , aladin s plug - ins are restricted to being java applications that can run inside the same jvm , which sometimes leads to resource , packaging and class - compatibility problems .",
    "the visivo and aladin developers overcame this constraint by making visivo , a c++ application , control aladin through the latter s scripting interface .",
    "however , the architecture is no longer symmetrical and aladin is unable to control visivo in return .",
    "it was recognized that there was a need to generalize the visivo / aladin interoperability to arbitrary applications and thus the votech consortium @xcite , of which the visivo team is a founder member , created the plastic interoperability protocol . through plastic , applications can share data and link views .",
    "data exploration using disparate linked views of the data is not a new idea : for example , the mirage @xcite and xmdvtool @xcite applications each supports several visualization methods allowing the user to explore data simultaneously using different methods .",
    "plastic extends this concept to allow linked views across applications .",
    "+ plastic works through a locally running daemon application called a  plastic hub  and is derived from the technology developed for the astro runtime @xcite .",
    "applications communicate with the plastic hub using one of several protocols : different protocols are supported to make it easier to adopt plastic by application developers .",
    "plastic does not define a fixed api of operations that all applications must support .",
    "instead , it employs a simple inter - application messaging system : applications send each other messages requesting certain actions .",
    "these are sent via the plastic hub , which then routes them to their destinations .",
    "the current set of messages includes  load this table  , and  select / highlight these data points  , but can be extended by application developers as new ways of collaborating arise .",
    "the advantage of the hub - based architecture is that individual applications need only understand one of the hub s communication protocols , and the hub is responsible for any required translation .",
    "furthermore , applications can dynamically discover other applications and their capabilities by interrogating the hub .",
    "plastic is platform and language neutral and , at the time of writing , has been incorporated into more than a dozen applications written in java , c++ , python , perl , tcl and javascript / html including topcat , aladin , visivo , vospec @xcite , astroweka and reflex @xcite .",
    "the following example illustrates how visivo s plastic interaction works in practice , with several applications exploiting each other s strengths to explore data taken from the paper by digby et al . @xcite .",
    "the astrogrid workbench @xcite is first used to search for suitable data in the supercosmos science archive @xcite and sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "the astronomer begins his analysis by starting topcat @xcite , which connects to the plastic hub .",
    "the astronomer then uses plastic to send the supercosmos data directly to topcat ( figure [ plasticfig1 ] ) .",
    "the supercosmos data does not contain the attributes that the astronomer needs , so he uses topcat to add synthetic columns to calculate the colour indices of the sources and their reduced proper motions .",
    "a scatterplot of the r - i colour index against the reduced proper motion reveals that the sources fall into three populations : white dwarfs , sub dwarfs and main sequence stars ( figure [ plasticfig2 ] ) .",
    "to fully understand this dataset the astronomer starts visivo , since it specializes in plotting multidimensional data .",
    "visivo connects with the plastic hub , and shortly afterwards the workbench and topcat s menus update to reflect the fact that visivo is running and able to receive votables .",
    "the astronomer sends the augmented data from topcat to visivo and uses visivo to create a 4d plot of r - i colour index , g - r colour index , reduced proper motion , and magnitude ( using the latter to choose the colour of the points from a lookup table ) ( figure [ plasticfig3 ] ) .",
    "the white dwarf population can then be selected in topcat and is automatically highlighted in visivo through plastic for further exploration ( figure [ plasticfig4 ] ) .",
    "finally , interesting objects can selected using visivo s picker tool and sent via plastic to aladin for overlaying over an image so that the astronomer can see their spatial distribution .",
    "this workflow is , of course , greatly simplified . in reality",
    "the data would be transferred back and forth between visivo and other applications , with interesting clusters extracted and spurious data removed .",
    "it could be even be sent to statistical applications such as astroweka @xcite and eirik @xcite to aid the astronomer in identifying clusters and trends .",
    "while some of the above workflow could be accomplished by saving the dataset from one application and loading it in the next , plastic makes the operation seamless .",
    "in this section , as an example of the practical usage of visivo , we will show how the tool can help the researcher in the analysis of two different problems : the classification of galaxies between star forming and quiescent objects and the detection of shock waves in galaxy clusters      one of the most widely used methods relies on the intrinsic - colour versus absolute magnitude diagram : in this representations , redder objects , assumed to be quiescent , occupy a well defined locus , also known as _",
    "red sequence_. on the other hand , having spectroscopic information at hand , the equivalent width of the [ oii ] emission line is a well known tracer of on - going star formation activity , while the depth of the break at 4000 @xmath30 is an indicator of stellar age ( the higher the break , the older the stellar population is ) .",
    "the question we ask ourselves is whether using one or the other of these indicators , we select the same population of galaxies , and also whether these indicators show some evolution with redshift . starting from the vvds epoch1 survey @xcite , we have extracted a subsample of galaxies with secure redshift , for which the equivalent width of the [ oii ] emission line ( simply named [ oii ] from here on ) , and the depth of the 4000 @xmath30 break ( from here on d4000 ) has been measured with good confidence ( see franzetti 2007 for details ) . our global initial sample consists of 4640 galaxies , and for each object we have a measure of : v absolute magnitude , intrinsic u - v colour , redshift , [ oii ] and d4000 . as a first step ,",
    "we import the ascii file where such information is stored into visivo , and do a first rough visualization of d4000 vs. [ oii ] vs. z. such plot shows that there are @xmath31 25 objects for which an anomalously large [ oii ] and/or d4000 has been measured .",
    "as we are currently interested in the global properties of the sample , and not in the outliers , we use the subsample function to select the bulk of our data , eliminating such outliers . in figure",
    "[ tot_sample]a , the 3d representation of the d4000 vs. [ oii ] vs. z for the remaining objects is shown .",
    "the colour scale indicates the absolute magnitude associated to each object .",
    "two effects are immediately visible from figure [ tot_sample]a : the first one is the _ to be expected _ selection effect on galaxy luminosity : the further we go in redshift , the more luminous are the galaxies we have in our sample ( we have lesser and lesser blue points as redshift increases ) .",
    "the second effect we see is a tendency for d4000 to decrease with increasing redshift . before further inspecting this decrease , which can be scientifically very promising , we get rid of the luminosity selection effect , by extracting from our global sample a volume limited sub - sample , i.e. we include only objects having an absolute magnitude visible throughout the whole redshift range",
    "this is easily done by displaying the absolute magnitude and redshift , and cut the sample at an absolute magnitude @xmath32 using the subsample function ( see figure [ tot_sample]b ) .",
    "we save such selection in an ascii file , for further use . + now that we have a subsample clean from selection effects , we can go back to our original problem , and first of all we want to see whether the effect of d4000 decreasing as redshift increases is still noticeable .    , on the bottom the photometric indicators u - v and @xmath33 .",
    "in both cases , a trend of increased abundance of galaxies showing low star age ( top ) and bluer colours ( bottom ) at higher redshifts is visible , title=\"fig:\",width=415 ] , on the bottom the photometric indicators u - v and @xmath33 . in both cases ,",
    "a trend of increased abundance of galaxies showing low star age ( top ) and bluer colours ( bottom ) at higher redshifts is visible , title=\"fig:\",width=415 ]    in fig .",
    "[ starform_evol]a , we show the d4000 vs. [ oii ] vs. z datacube , where for clarity we use 4 different colours for different d4000 ranges : at higher redshifts , not only d4000 assumes smaller values , but rotating the cube we see that [ oii ] has a tendency to be higher ( on average ) with increasing redshift .",
    "these two effects point towards a higher star forming rate at higher redshift , and especially for @xmath34 .",
    "if we use the second star - formation indicator , i.e. the colour magnitude diagram vs. redshift ( see fig . [ starform_evol ] b ) , we see again that at higher redshift , blue galaxies are more abundant than red galaxies . + as a last point , we want to see whether galaxies which would be defined as quiescent in a colour magnitude diagram are also spectroscopically quiescent ( i.e. galaxies belonging to the red sequence should not show emission lines ) , and vice - versa , if galaxies which show an old stellar population are indeed red in intrinsic colour .     vs. redshift data cube .",
    "the red sequence galaxies are indicated as red , the bluest one in blue , while green dots are galaxies in between . bottom ( b ) : colour magnitude diagram vs. redshift : red dots are now galaxies with old stellar age and no sign of star formation , title=\"fig:\",width=415 ]   vs. redshift data cube .",

    "a consistent and complete description of the dynamics of cosmological shock waves is far from being achieved .",
    "however , numerical simulations provide a valuable contribution to the comprehension of this process . we have performed a large number of simulations using the enzo code , which is an adaptive mesh refinement cosmological code ( http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/enzo ) , developed by bryan et al . @xcite . the enzo code couples an n - body particle - mesh solver with an ppm eulerian adaptive method for ideal gas - dynamics by colella & woodward 1984 .",

    "this technique , coupled with the unprecedented good resolution of our data in the outermost regions of virialized structures ( where shocks very often occur ) , allows us to study dynamical regimes never seen before .",
    "the use of a visualization code such as visivo is of great importance because it allows us to detect and follow the behaviours of shock patterns which are characterized by very complex volume  filling properties , which had always been erased by most standard reduction analyses and can be of primary importance to correctly describe the observational impact of these mechanisms .",
