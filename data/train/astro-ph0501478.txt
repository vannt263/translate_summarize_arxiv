    "because of its depth this is potentially a good field to study formation and clustering of galaxies , the only handicap being its small size ( 1.26 physical mpc on a side at z@xmath13 ) .",
    "the census of galaxies at z@xmath13 is also interesting because the gunn - peterson trough has been observed near this redshift ( fan et al 2002 ) , suggesting that reionization ended around z=6 .",
    "on the other hand , evidence from microwave background observations suggests that substantial reionization likely occurred at @xmath14 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and lyman-@xmath15  emitters ( rhoads et al .",
    "2004 , hu et al .",
    "2002 , and taniguchi et al .",
    "2004 ) suggest that reionization was largely complete by redshift z @xmath16 ( malhotra & rhoads 2004 , hereafter mr04 ) .",
    "strong clustering of galaxies at this epoch would complicate the reionization scenarios , leading to inhomogeneous reionization .    in accounting for the source(s ) of reionizing photons at the epoch of reionization ,",
    "quasars and active galactic nuclei are not sufficient ( barger et al .",
    "2003 , moustakas & immler 2004 , wang et al . 2004 ) and even a hitherto undetected population of faint or obscured quasars would not be able to reionize the igm at z  6 without overproducing the unresolved soft x - ray background ( dijkstra etal ) \" .",
    "therefore galaxies must provide a large part of the ionizing photon budget .",
    "one of the major goals of the very faint imaging in the hubble ultra deep field is to determine the luminosity function and therefore the ionizing photon budget of the galaxies at z @xmath17 6 .",

    "about 40 orbits ( 100 ks ) of exposure time went into the spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "details of the observations and data reduction are described in a paper by pirzkal et al .",
    "the benefits of spectroscopy are several .",
    "first , we are able to confirm a substantial fraction , but not all , of ( @xmath0- @xmath1 ) dropouts as high redshift galaxies .",
    "second , the spectra give the slope of the continuum emission , which can constrain stellar populations ( modulo extinction ) .",
    "the third advantage of using the spectra to select objects is the easily characterized selection function .",
    "the initial color selection can be very inclusive and thus complete , if spectra are finally used to identify objects .",
    "finally , we get redshifts accurate to @xmath19 , which is essential for studying clustering .    in section 2 , we describe the selection of candidates and spectral confirmation .",
    "section 3 describes a comparison of redshifts of objects with their expected and observed broad - band colors . in section 4",
    "we explore the overdensity found at z=5.9 , and section 5 contains discussion and conclusions .",
    "appendix a contains the grism spectra of the 23 high redshift galaxies and 4 intermediate redshift red galaxies along with cutouts from images in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23  filters .",
    "for candidate selection we used the source catalog released by the udf team , which is based on the i - band image , supplemented by sources which were detected in the z - band only .",
    "for the very red sources ( @xmath0-@xmath1)@xmath24 magnitudes we use the z - band detection parameters ( e.g. size , ra , dec ) because the signal - to - noise ratio is higher in the z - band for such red sources .",
    "high redshift candidates were selected by their red color in the acs f775w and f850lp filters ( which correspond to sdss @xmath25 and @xmath26 filters ; see beckwith et al .",
    "the selection criteria were + ( 1 ) red color in the @xmath0 , @xmath1bands : ( @xmath0-@xmath1)@xmath24 magnitudes ; which should pick up sources with redshift @xmath27 + ( 2 ) no detected flux in the f435w ( `` b '' ) filter ( @xmath28 ) ; and + ( 3 ) @xmath1@xmath29 magnitude . although our spectra typically reach depth @xmath30 , fainter broad band @xmath1magnitudes may be achieved when either ( a ) the redshift @xmath31 , so that part of @xmath1bandpass contributes only noise ( and no signal ) to the measurements , or ( b ) the galaxy has a prominent emission line .",
    "the usual criteria for selecting lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) are oriented towards minimizing the interlopers .",
    "one either takes a stringent color cut , so that one has few interlopers ( e.g. red galaxies at intermediate redshifts ) - both bunker et al .",
    "2004 and yan & windhorst 2004 take a color cut of ( @xmath0-@xmath1)@xmath32 .",
    "the other approach is to demand a red color across the break and a blue color longward of the break ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1995 , giavalisco 2002 ) . for @xmath33 galaxies in the hudf",
    ", this approach requires near - infrared data .",
    "the only nir images of the udf that reach approximately sufficient depth ( bouwens et al 2004 ) cover only a fraction of the full udf . with slitless spectroscopy we are able to obtain spectra of all the objects , so we choose to be generous in our color - cut to define the sample in order to improve completeness .    with these cuts we obtained 106 candidates . among these , 25 are brighter than @xmath1(ab)=27.1 and 45 are brighter than @xmath1=27.5 .",
    "the nominal sensitivity limit for the grapes spectra is between @xmath1=27.1 and 27.5 , depending on the redshift .",
    "( a fixed continuum flux density at @xmath34  corresponds to a fainter magnitude in @xmath1-band for higher redshift objects , where intergalactic absorption removes most flux from the blue end of the filter bandpass . )",
    "comparison of candidates so selected with the catalogs of yan & windhorst 2004 and bunker et al .",
    "2004 , shows good agreement , missing only one object from the yw04 sample which lies close to another galaxy .",
    "it has been difficult to extract the spectra of some of the objects where high redshift candidates are close to other objects ( see the next section ) .",
    "since this is a random occurance it does not introduce a bias into our sample of spectroscopically selected galaxies .",
    "seven of these sources with @xmath1@xmath35 have spectra that overlap substantially with brighter sources nearby , and will not be considered any further .",
    "another four lie outside the grapes region , which has about 85% overlap with the udf region . out of the remaining 34 ,",
    "29 have useful spectra , the rest have low s / n spectra because of a combination of low surface brightness and rejection of a significant fraction of the data by contamination",
    ". thus an incompleteness correction of about a factor of ( 46/29 ) or about 1.6 should be applied to any results derived from the spectroscopic sample alone , since we were not able to determine the nature of some sources due to spectral overlap .",
    "about 100 kiloseconds of grism exposures can potentially provide spectra of _ all _ sources in an unbiased way . in practice",
    "some information is lost because of overlap of the spectra .",
    "the spectra are subject to more crowding than the images since for each object the light is dispersed over 100 pixels rather than a few in one dimension . to mitigate the overlap of the spectra",
    "the grism data was taken at four roll angles with position angles of 126 , 134 , 217 , and 231 degrees .",
    "previous grism observations of a supernova field yielded another 24 ksec of data at a pa of 117 degrees . in standard axe reductions ( pirzkal et al .",
    "2001 ) , the parts of the spectra that have overlap with others are flagged as contaminated . in our analysis",
    "we have modified the code to flag contamination not just as a yes / no binary decision but as an estimate of how much of the flux comes from the contaminant ( see pirzkal et al .",
    "2004 for more details ) .",
    "so a spectrum of a bright source contaminated by a faint source is still usable . in the present paper",
    "we reject all pixels contaminated by light that is estimated to be more than 33% of the source light . as a further check on the contamination by other spectra , we demand that the broad - band flux from imaging agree with the sum over that passband in grism data .",
    "two sources are identified as dwarf stars : udf  443 is an l dwarf and udf  366 is an m dwarf , on the basis of their spectra and compact spatial profiles ( see pirzkal et al .",
    "2004b for a complete list of unresolved sources in the hudf ) .",
    "similarly four objects udf8038 , udf8238 , udf6676 and udf3551 are definitely identified as red galaxies at moderate redshifts based on the absence of a spectral break in the grism spectra and near infrared colors ( figure [ spectra - red ] ) .",
    "daddi et al .",
    "2005 , identify udf8238 as an intermediate redshift ( z=1.39 ) galaxy along with some other red galaxies on the basis of grapes spectra .",
    "twenty three galaxies are identified as high redshift galaxies on the basis of their spectra .",
    "this identification is based on detecting the lyman break in the continuum for 22 of these sources and lyman-@xmath15  line and break in one source . for sources as bright as udf2225 , identifying",
    "a lyman break is unambiguous ( see figure [ spectra ] for this spectrum ) .",
    "for most other galaxies the signal - to - noise ratio is low , and thus the following procedure was adopted to select reasonable spectral confirmations .",
    "the spectra were fit with a lyman break galaxy template with a power law spectrum of slope @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 ) attenuated by igm absorption calculated according to the prescription of madau 1995 .",
    "we do a grid search on the parameters redshift and flux at 1250   to determine the best fit . with the low s / n",
    ", the @xmath38 per degree of freedom is generally less than 1 . for the sources to be identified as high redshift galaxies we require that ( a ) the chi - square per degree of freedom be about one ; ( b ) the combined flux redward of the break is well detected , with net @xmath39 ; and ( c ) the broad - band fluxes are consistent with the grism flux and the fitted lbg spectrum , even though we do not fit to broad - band fluxes while determining redshifts . with regard to point ( c ) we tolerate about 30% discrepancy in the flux between broad - band and grism measurements , because the aperture match between imaging and the grism often results in discrepancies of that order .",
    "among the 29 objects that we have examined to have clean ( non - contaminated ) , relatively high s / n spectra , 23 are high redshift galaxies .",
    "this implies about 80% chance of finding a high redshift galaxy with a color selection of ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) @xmath40 .",
    "the five galaxies with spectral shapes indicating old or reddened populations at medium redshifts have colors of ( @xmath0-@xmath1)@xmath41 .",
    "thus a color cut of ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) @xmath42 adopted by yan and windhorst 2004 and by bunker et al .",
    "2004 is succesful at eliminating moderate redshift galaxies .",
    "the m - dwarf stars identified spectroscopically have ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) colors similar to the high redshift galaxies , but are not as faint ( pirzkal et al . 2005 ) .",
    "figure [ id2 ] shows the color magnitude distribution of the spectroscopically confirmed high redshift galaxies , stars , and moderate redshift red galaxies .",
    "in figure [ col_z ] we plot the ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) color of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies against the redshift found by fitting a lyman - break galaxy template .",
    "superposed on that distribution is the expected color for star - forming galaxies from bruzual & charlot 2003 models with stellar population ages of 1,10,100 and 1000 myrs assuming constant star - formation models with solar metallicity .",
    "we see that the observed color - redshift distribution follows the theoretical curves reasonably .",
    "this is not suprising , since the main effect determining the ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) color is the shifting of the lyman break to longer wavelengths with redshift .",
    "there are color variations in the galaxies and some are bluer or redder than the models .",
    "the scatter in colors seen is larger than the models would indicate , but are not more deviant than @xmath43 in the color errors .",
    "the redder than expected color can be explained by invoking dust .",
    "the bluer color could be due to the presence of lyman-@xmath15  line emission which is not distinctly seen due to the low resolution of the spectra , but can make ( @xmath0- @xmath1 ) bluer for galaxies upto @xmath44 .",
    "some of the apparent color scatter may be due to systematic errors in photometry due to the presence of neighbours .",
    "there is also an intrinsic color variation seen in two pairs of sources ( 3377/3398 and 3317/3325 ) .",
    "both pairs are resolved into separate objects in the official hudf catalog but have the same redshift based on the break seen in the spectra .",
    "the difference in the ( @xmath0- @xmath1 ) color is 0.7 magnitudes for the 3317/3325 pair and 0.4 magnitudes for the 3377/3398 pair .",
    "this shows that there is likely to be a fair variation of ( @xmath0- @xmath1 ) colors within the same object .",
    "whatever the reason for the color scatter , figure [ col_z ] shows that it would lead to 20 - 30% incompleteness with the ( @xmath0-@xmath1)@xmath32 cut for @xmath12 galaxies ( yw04 , bunker et al .",
    "figure [ hist_z ] shows the redshift distribution of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies .",
    "we see an overdensity at @xmath45 . an overdensity was suggested by stanway et al .",
    "( 2004 ) on the basis of three galaxies in and near the udf .",
    "we see it confirmed here , with 15 galaxies in the redshift range instead of 6 expected from the lower and higher redshifts in this sample .",
    "thus the overdensity is 3.5 @xmath9 , assuming poisson statistics .",
    "doing the most nave and straightforward estimate , we find that about 2/3rd of the galaxies in the sample are in 1/3rd of the volume , implying an overdensity of a factor of four .",
    "this overdensity can not be explained by selection effects alone . in figure [ hist_z ]",
    "we over - plot the expected number density of objects .",
    "folding in the color selection , the grism response function and a lyman break galaxy luminosity function from yw04 , we predict the number of galaxies in each redshift bin , shown in figure [ hist_z ] .",
    "the drop - off at the higher redshift is due to a decline in the sensitivity of the grism at the red end , the roll - off at the low redshift in the models is due to the color selection , which starts to make us lose the bluer end of the z=5.5 sample .",
    "the solid curves show selection function with the color variation introduced by supposing a reddening with mean e(b - v)=0.15 magnitudes and @xmath46 0.15 magnitudes , which is standard for lyman break galaxies ( giavalisco , private comm . ) ; the underlying stellar populations are 1 and 1000 myrs old for the two curves .",
    "the dashed curves show the selection function at z=5.5 if we use the wider color range empirically seen in our sample at z=5.7 - 6.1 . in the end",
    "the total number of i - drops matches the yw04 number and the overdensity at z=5.9 is seen to be a factor of 2 .",
    "thus a factor of two is the conservative lower bound on the peak at overdensity at @xmath47 , averaged over the field of view .",
    "the true overdensity could be higher if the peak is substantially spread out by low redshift resolution in the grism data . with the low resolution spectra afforded by the acs grism",
    ", we are able to determine the redshifts to an accuracy of @xmath48 for a typical object of size 0.\"25 . besides this , lyman-@xmath15  emission can bias the redshift measurements obtained from the lyman break , even if the line is too weak to appear obvious in the low - resolution grism spectrum .",
    "the shift in the estimate is described by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fwhm resolution of the spectrum . for typical values in the grapes survey",
    ", this corresponds to a shift of @xmath51 , or a redshift change of @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 .",
    "so any spike in the distribution of galaxies is smeared by up to @xmath54 due to the limited wavelength resolution of the grism .",
    "the overdensity at z=5.9 is also supported by complementary data on lyman-@xmath15  emitters from ctio by wang , malhotra & rhoads ( 2005 ) who have imaged a large area , 36 @xmath55 mpc on a side , including the hubble ultra deep field .",
    "they show that the hudf sits on the edge of a much larger scale ( @xmath56 mpc ) structure traced by lyman-@xmath15  emitters at z=5.7 - 5.77 .",
    "wang et al . 2005 report roughly a factor 3 - 4 overdensity in the lyman-@xmath15  emitters at z @xmath57 , compared to other studies of lyman-@xmath15  emitters at z=5.8 ( rhoads et al .",
    "2003 , rhoads & malhotra 2001 , hu et al . 2003 , mr04 ) .",
    "figure [ lss ] shows the distribution in the sky of the 15 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath58 in the hudf along with the larger scale structure seen in the lyman-@xmath15  emitters at z=5.7 - 5.77 .",
    "we see that the galaxy distribution in the hudf continues the voids seen in the larger distribution . even within the hudf",
    "the @xmath33 galaxies are not distributed uniformly , and avoid one corner of the field .",
    "we applied a two dimensional kolmogrov - smirnov test ( peacock 1983 , fasano & franceschini 1987 , press et al .",
    "1992 ) to the distribution of the 15 galaxies at @xmath58 .",
    "even with just 15 galaxies , the test gives only a 5% chance that they could be so arranged due to chance .",

    "the location of the hubble ultra deep field was selected to include a reasonably bright known galaxy at z=5.8 found in the goods survey ( dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) . given that , we should consider what sort of overdensity is expected .",
    "we calculate the overdensity in the galaxy abundance in a cylindrical volume centered around a massive central galaxy .",
    "the first step is to compute the halo mass of the central galaxy .",
    "the total mass of a halo that corresponds to the abundance of 1 object between @xmath59 in a solid angle of @xmath60arcmin@xmath61 is @xmath62 , which in turn corresponds to a @xmath63 peak in the density field .",
    "this assumes a duty cycle of @xmath64 yrs : each halo is assumed to be visible only a fraction @xmath65 of the time , where @xmath66 is the age of the universe .",
    "the background cosmology is assumed to be flat @xmath67cdm with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , consistent with the recent _ wmap _ measurements ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the halo mass function was taken from the fit to numerical simulations in jenkins et al .",
    "the second step is to estimate the typical expected galaxy overdensity in the observed volume .",
    "the volume is taken here to be a cylinder centered at @xmath70 with angular diameter 3 ( or @xmath71 comoving mpc at @xmath70 ) and extending over the redshift range @xmath72 ( corresponding to a length of @xmath73 comoving mpc ) .",
    "the mean overdensity @xmath74 of galaxies of mass @xmath75 expected to fall within this cylinder can then be found by integrating the correlation function over the cylinder :    @xmath76.\\ ] ]    here @xmath77 is the linear growth function , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the linear halo bias @xcite of the `` satellite '' and central halos with mass @xmath75 and @xmath80 respectively , @xmath81 is a low - radius cut , which we take to be the sum of the virial radii of the @xmath75 and @xmath80 halos ( in practice , the value does not matter ) , @xmath82 is the 3d correlation function , and @xmath83 ( the @xmath82 subscripts @xmath84 and @xmath85 refer to the values for galaxies and dark matter respectively .",
    "we find @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "this suggests that a factor of @xmath88two overdensity should be typical in the observed volume .",
    "we note that this overdensity is entirely a result of the high bias ( @xmath89 ) of the massive halos . as a result of the long redshift extent of the overdense region ( an order of magnitude larger than the correlation length of @xmath90 mpc ) , the corresponding mass overdensity ( @xmath91 ) is negligibly small , @xmath92 .",
    "if we assume that the redshift extent is reduced by a factor of 2 or 10 ( changing @xmath93 from 85 mpc to 42.5 or 8.5 mpc ) , then we find @xmath94 and 6.3 , respectively .",
    "thus higher resolution spectra may see a more dramatic overdensity .",
    "three - dimensional effects can clearly be relevant .",
    "the above results should motivate a study of the probability of intersecting the cosmic filamentary density distribution in a way to reveal an elongated overdense region with a large aspect ratio .",
    "this paper establishes the fraction of color selected objects that are _ bona fide _ high redshift galaxies to be around 80% for the color @xmath95 and magnitude limit of z=27.127.5 . for a color selection of @xmath18 and magnitude limit of @xmath96 mag ,",
    "the success rate is 14/15 , but such a color selection misses five blue objects that are at redshifts @xmath97 .    an overdensity is seen in the redshift distribution at @xmath5 .",
    "the galaxy number density in this redshift range is a factor of two to four high .",
    "the extent of the redshift range spanned by this overdensity may be smaller , because the grism spectra give redshifts for lbgs accurate only to @xmath48 .",
    "lyman-@xmath15  line emission and absorption may further increase the observed scatter .",
    "hence the overdensity may be even larger in a small volume .",
    "hints of such an overdensity were seen by stanway et al.(2003 ) , who found three lyman-@xmath15emitters at @xmath98 in their spectroscopic followup .",
    "one of their objects is the same as object number 2225 in our sample .",
    "further , higher resolution spectroscopy would be invaluable in determining the exact redshift extent and structure of this overdense region .",
    "a search for lyman-@xmath15  emitters has shown an overdensity at z=5.77 ( 823 nm ) relative to z=5.70 ( 815 nm ) ( wang , malhotra & rhoads 2005 ) , as well as a strong spatial gradient .",
    "the hubble ultra deep field sits at the edge of this overdensity at z=5.77 , and judging by the redshift histograms seen in figure [ hist_z ] , is part of it . if we naively multiply the spatial extent ( @xmath99 ) of the structure at z=5.77 seen by wang et al .",
    "2005 and the redshift extent ( @xmath100 ) of the overdensity seen in this paper , we would conclude that the overdensity spans a volume of comoving @xmath101 .",
    "according to current theories it would be hard to produce a net overdensity of a factor of 4 over such a large volume , while an overdensity of two could be due to the presence of a bright galaxy in the udf .",
    "the overdensity at z=5.7 - 6.1 , combined with a simple selection function afforded by the grism , gives us an opportunity to derive the luminosity function and star - formation rate in such an overdensity .",
    "the complicating factor is the incompleteness in the spectroscopic sample . as mentioned in section 2.1 , we do not have spectral information for 17 out of 46 objects brighter than @xmath1  of 27.5 .",
    "we can , however bracket the parameters of the luminosity function by assuming that the spectroscopically confirmed sample represents the lower limit and the upper limit is obtained by adding to that all the objects for which we have no information .",
    "figure [ lumfn ] shows the luminosity function for these two cases in the redshift range @xmath102 and the best fitting schecter functions . following yan and windhorst ( 2004 ) , we assume a slope of @xmath103 and derive parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these values are comparable to the yw04 luminosity function for @xmath106 which is @xmath107 and @xmath108 . while and have correlated error when fitting only upto @xmath1@xmath109 , the integrated star - formation is fairly robustly estimated .",
    "the star - formation rate density ( sfrd ) derived from integrating over the luminosity function of the spectroscopically confirmed sample is @xmath110 , following the uv to sfr conversion in madau , pozetti & dickinson ( 1998 ) .",
    "correcting for completeness with a factor of 1.6 gives @xmath111 .",
    "all these values are significantly higher than yw04 value of @xmath112 , consistent with there being an overdensity of at least a factor of two in this redshift range .",
    "the lower bound to the sfr is obtained by summing up the uv luminosity in the objects spectroscopically confirmed and normalizing by the volume , which is simply calculated as the comoving volume between @xmath113 .",
    "thus the minimum sfr=@xmath114 which is twice the estimate of bunker et al .",
    "2004 from the same field .",
    "correcting for spectroscopic incompleteness leads to sfr=@xmath115 which comes close to the required sfr needed for driving reionization especially if there are metal poor stars in these galaxies and the igm has a higher temperature ( stiavelli et al .",
    "the volume calculations above have taken the whole area of the hudf , whereas on the plane of the sky @xmath12 objects occupy about half ( or less than ) the area of the acs chip ( figure [ lss ] ) .",
    "thus the volume over - density is a factor of four and the local sfr in the overdensity is definitely enough to drive reionization of the local igm .    by comparing with the luminosity function of lyman-@xmath15  emitters",
    ", we see that the space density normalization of lbgs in the udf as measured here and by yan and windhorst @xmath116 ) is two to four times higher than that of lyman-@xmath15  emitters for which mr04 derive @xmath117 at z=5.7 .",
    "the lyman-@xmath15  luminosity function derived by mr04 is based on many surveys in different parts of the sky , and therefore should be robust to cosmic variance . given the overdensity estimates of a factor of 2 - 4 here , the difference between of the udf lbgs and lyman-@xmath15  galaxies is not significant",
    ". the lbg space density could be consistent with that of lyman-@xmath15  emitters at z=5.7 .",
    "that does not mean that every lbg has lyman-@xmath15emission , or that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the two .",
    "that is because we often do not know the continuum luminosity of the lyman-@xmath15  galaxies , and they could be fainter than even this sample in the rest uv . on the flip side many of the lbgs in the present sample could have weak lyman-@xmath15  emission which would not be detected in low resolution spectra .",
    "the sfrd derived from lyman-@xmath15emitters is @xmath118 , which is roughly a tenth of the sfrd derived here .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that sfr for individual lyman-@xmath15galaxies , derived from the lyman-@xmath15  line alone , is on the average 1/10th that of a typical lbg ( rhoads et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 , dawson et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "this sample of spectroscopically confirmed lyman break galaxies can also provide an independent test of reionization .",
    "if the igm is neutral at @xmath31 , the fraction of lyman break galaxies that show lyman-@xmath15  line emission should drop , because the damping wings of neutral igm reduce the line to at most 1/3rd its original strength ( haiman 2002 , santos 2004 ) . prior to this paper ,",
    "all the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at @xmath31 , and all but two at @xmath119 , showed lyman-@xmath15  emission .",
    "this may be a selection effect , since objects with strong lines are easier to confirm spectrocopically . for reference ,",
    "only 25% of lbgs show lyman-@xmath15  emission at @xmath120 ( steidel et al .",
    "now we have a sample of about 23 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) selected using low resolution spectra from the grism on hst at redshifts @xmath121@xmath122 , not biased by the presence or absence of lyman-@xmath15line .",
    "deep , higher - resolution spectra of these objects should be able to detect lines with rest - frame ew of 30  .",
    "this would determine the lyman-@xmath15  emitter fraction and thus constrain whether the igm is neutral .",

    "thanks are also due to rodger thompson and his team for making available the nicmos observations of the same region .",
    "we thank the referee for a prompt and helpful report which improved this paper .",

    "in this appendix we present the grism spectra of 23 high redshift objects . on each",
    ", we superpose the best fit lyman break spectrum , represented by a power law of @xmath123 and madau igm absorption ( madau 1995 ) ( top panel ) . we also see a consistency with the broad - band fluxes ( middle panel ) .",
    "the agreement with the broad band fluxes is not perfect due to aperture mismatches , which we have tried to minimize and because the broad - band fluxes were not used in fitting , and the uv slope of the galaxies does vary from object to object , unlike the models we have used .",
    "the quality of the data , the s / n seen in most sources , and the limited wavelength range redward of the lyman break simply did not support fitting the slope as an extra parameter .",
    "the error - bars on the near - infrared fluxes were estimated by placing random apertures of a range of sizes on the finished image and estimating the noise properties of those apertures .",
    "the error - bars calculated this way are larger than the typical errors quoted elsewhere ( bouwens et al .",
    "2004 ) , but reflect a more realistic picture .",
    "a similar exercise with acs images gave error estimates that are similar to the formal error estimates obtained by multiplying the rms deviations with the square - root of the number of pixels .",
