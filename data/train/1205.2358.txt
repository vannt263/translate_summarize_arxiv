    "the structural changes in an enzyme are intimately linked to its function .",
    "ligand - exchange events of enzymes through either binding / unbinding or chemical transformation are often accompanied by conformational changes to the protein @xcite .",
    "indeed , the rates of catalysis are frequently limited by the slow conformational changes in enzymes ( e.g. @xcite ) . optimal enzyme engineering would thus require a deep understanding of both the chemical steps of catalysis and how the structural changes in the enzyme help to facilitate these events @xcite . of course , one powerful source of functional information comes from the study of enzyme kinetics .",
    "however , classical enzyme kinetics have traditionally followed the chemical transformation of substrate to product , and only give indirect evidence about structural changes to the enzyme itself .",
    "for example , substrate binding involves the formation of noncovalent interactions between enzyme and substrate , but a conformational change in the enzyme ( and/or substrate ) may be required to maximize these interactions ; traditional enzyme kinetics may not be able to tease out these two separate , but related events .",
    "more recent biophysical techniques , including those from single - molecule spectroscopy @xcite and solution - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , can monitor structural changes in an enzyme itself more directly .",
    "a synthesis of kinetic information from these recent biophysical experiments and from more traditional ensemble enzyme kinetics would bring a richer understanding of the physical and chemical barriers to catalysis .    one technique that has brought deep insights into the  conformational gymnastics \" an enzyme undergoes during its catalytic cycle is nmr @xmath0 relaxation dispersion spectroscopy @xcite",
    ". this technique measures conformational exchange between two ( or more ) protein conformations , and can give insight into the kinetics of exchange , the populations of each of the exchanging conformations ( i.e.  the thermodynamics ) , and can give structural information about higher energy conformations , even when the conformational equilibrium is highly skewed ( i.e.  less than 5% of the conformational ensemble is in the higher energy conformation ) @xcite .",
    "such methodology has been used to monitor conformational exchange processes on the @xmath1s - ms timescale for all of the intermediates in the catalytic cycle of _ echerichia coli _ dihydrofolate reductase ( dhfr ) @xcite .",
    "dhfr catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate ( dhf ) to tetrahydrofolate ( thf ) using the cofactor nadph , and has served as an important model system for investigating the interplay of conformational dynamics , binding and catalysis @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the higher energy or  excited - state \" conformations for all the intermediates in dhfr catalysis are structurally similar to either the next and/or previous  ground - state \" conformation in the catalytic cycle of dhfr @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the excited - state conformations predict the next structural state of the enzyme . with such rich functional information , _",
    "e.coli _ dhfr is ideal in the development of a kinetic framework that encompasses both the traditional pre - steady state enzyme kinetics and the kinetics on the structural changes in the enzyme gleaned from the nmr @xmath0 relaxation dispersion experiments .",
    "the @xmath0 relaxation dispersion results from dhfr also prompted the suggestion that ligand - exchange events on this enzyme , and likely other enzymes @xcite , can operate through a  conformational selection \" mechanism .",
    "in conformational selection @xcite , conformational changes occur _ predominantly prior _ to a binding process , an unbinding process , or a catalytic process ; the ligands appear to select a conformation from the protein ensemble for binding , unbinding , or catalysis @xcite .",
    "in contrast ,  induced change \" @xcite proposes that the conformational change occurs _ predominantly after _ a binding , unbinding , or catalytic process @xcite .",
    "critically , the timing of the ligand interaction and the structural changes to the enzyme is not trivial ; the processes of conformational selection and induced change have important biological consequences in terms of substrate promiscuity , enzyme regulation , protein evolution , and biological information storage @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we present a general kinetic framework that can be used ( 1 ) to distinguish conformational - selection from induced - change processes , and ( 2 ) to determine the rates of the physical substeps ( conformational changes ) and chemical substeps ( binding / unbinding , or chemical reactions ) of these processes from a combined analysis of nmr @xmath0 relaxation dispersion and traditional enzyme kinetics experiments .",
    "we apply this framework here to _",
    "e.  coli _ dhfr and derive extended catalytic cycles of this enzyme that specify the ordering of events in the coupling of conformational changes , binding and catalysis .",
    "we focus on the major conformational changes of _",
    "e.  coli _ dhfr that occur during the catalytic step ( from  closed \" to  occluded \" , see fig .",
    "[ figure_structures ] ) and during unbinding of the product thf ( from  occluded \" back to  closed \" ) .",
    "we find that product unbinding occurs _ via _ conformational selection , whereas the conformational change during the catalytic step is an induced - change process ( see results section ) .",
    "our extended cycles help to explain the role of the conformational changes for the function of _",
    "e.  coli _ dhfr ( see discussions section ) .    the methods employed here to analyze the catalytic step and product unbinding of _ e.  coli _ dhfr can be generalized to binding , unbinding , and catalytic processes of other protein systems .",
    "our methods are based on general expressions for the effective rates of processes that involve two or more substeps , and on a mutational analysis of these effective rates . in this analysis",
    ", we focus on mutations distal to the binding site that mainly affect the conformational equilibrium of the protein .",
    "we find that conformational - selection processes are sensitive to such distal mutations because these processes involve a change to a low - populated , excited - state conformation , and because the equilibrium probability and excitation rate of this conformation depend on the conformational free - energy differences .",
    "in contrast , induced - change processes involve a conformational relaxation into a new ground - state after a binding , unbinding or catalytic event , which is rather insensitive to changes in conformational free - energy differences , provided ( i ) the conformational relaxation is fast compared to the rates of the chemical substep @xcite , or ( ii ) the transition - state for the conformational exchange is close in free energy and structure to the excited protein conformation .",
    "the analysis of the effect of distal mutations thus can provide the basis for a simple diagnostic to identify conformational - selection _ versus _ induced - change processes .",
    "the catalytic cycle of _ e.  coli _ dhfr involves five major intermediates ( see fig .  [ figure_wt_cycle ] ) .",
    "x - ray crystal structures indicate an ` occluded ' ground - state conformation of the active - site met20 loop ( residues 9 - 24 ) in the three intermediates with bound product thf , and a ` closed ' conformation of this loop in the other two intermediates @xcite .",
    "when the met20 loop is in an occluded conformation , its central region ( residues met16 and glu17 ) is flipped into the cofactor binding pocket such that the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor is sterically occluded from binding .",
    "however upon binding cofactor , residues met16 and glu17 are turned away from the nicotinamide binding pocket , residues met16-ala19 zip up into a type iii @xmath2-hairpin , and the side - chains of asn18 and met20 close down over the pterin ring of the substrate dhf to form the closed conformation .",
    "only the closed conformation allows proximal positioning of the cofactor and substrate reactive centers and therefore it is the closed conformation that must be adopted in the michaelis complex .",
    "the closed and occluded met20 loop conformations are stabilized by unique hydrogen bonding networks to the fg ( 116 - 132 ) and gh ( 142 - 150 ) loops , respectively ( see fig .  [ figure_structures ] ) .",
    "changes to the amino acids in the fg or gh loops that make contact with the met20 loop can severely alter the equilibrium between the closed and occluded conformations of the met20 loop .",
    "the mutant g121v , for example , has the occluded conformation as ground state in all five intermediates along the catalytic cycle @xcite , while the mutant s148a seems to have the closed conformation of the active - site loop as ground state in all intermediates @xcite .",
    "these amino acid substitutions have functional consequences for both the chemical step and the thf product release step that are accompanied by closed - occluded conformational changes .",
    "two steps in the catalytic cycle of _ e.  coli _ dhfr are accompanied by major structural changes in the enzyme  the catalytic step itself and the release of the product thf from the ternary complex of the enzyme with thf and nadph .",
    "division of the catalytic cycle into chemical ( including substrate binding / product release and chemical transformation of substrate to product ) and physical substeps requires an investigation of both steps .",
    "hydride transfer in the chemical step is only possible in the closed conformation , thus any conformational change in the enzyme through the catalytic step must occur after thf production i.e.  through an induced - change process . in the following ,",
    "we apply our kinetic framework to determine the rates of the chemical and physical substeps of this induced - change process from experimental data .",
    "the catalytic step of wild - type dhfr is associated with a conformational change from the closed conformation ( ce ) to the occluded conformation ( oe ) of the enzyme ( see fig .

    "we now break down the catalytic step into its chemical and physical substeps .",
