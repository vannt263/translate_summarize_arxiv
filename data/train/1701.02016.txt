    "our goal here is to briefly describe how the presence of @xmath147 localized absorbers of equal strength @xmath1 ( generalizations to different strength is obvious ) can be taken into account in the standard rmt model of chaotic scattering introduced in @xcite and described in detail in @xcite .",
    "in fact , one may conveniently think of a scattering system with @xmath148 open scattering channels and @xmath149 local absorbers as representing jointly a system of @xmath150 open channels , such that the corresponding @xmath151 scattering matrix @xmath152 of the full system is unitary due to the flux conservation . from that perspective",
    "the open channels are subdivided into @xmath0 _ scattering _ ones , described by the columns of @xmath14 matrix @xmath15 of coupling amplitudes taken , for example , as fixed orthogonal vectors satisfying @xmath153 and , similarly , @xmath147 _ absorptive _ ones described by the columns of @xmath154 matrix @xmath155 of coupling amplitudes @xmath156 taken as another set of fixed orthogonal vectors satisfying @xmath157 .",
    "we also assume that the vector space spanned by coupling vectors @xmath158 for the absorptive part is orthogonal to one spanned by vectors @xmath159 .",
    "in such an approach the ( sub - unitary ) scattering matrix @xmath160 describing the incoming / outgoing channels which were selected to support scattering is simply a @xmath144 diagonal sub - block of the whole @xmath161 scattering matrix @xmath152 .",
    "the matrix elements in that sub - block then have the standard form , see @xcite : @xmath162_{ij}w_{jb},\\ ] ] with the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath163 as is easy to check , the @xmath144 matrix @xmath3 can also be equivalently rewritten in a different form : @xmath164 by using the identity @xmath165 one can further find from ( [ scattmatt2 ] ) that @xmath166 the above equation makes it clear that the complex zeroes of @xmath167 are eigenvalues of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath168 those eigenvalues are situated , as long as absorption is non - zero , i.e. @xmath169 , in both positive and negative half - planes of the complex energy .",
    "when studying their distribution in the complex plane one can safely assume the matrices @xmath170 and @xmath171 to be diagonal , due to statistical rotational invariance of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath11 .",
    "choosing @xmath172 , so that the matrix @xmath155 is rank - one , and denoting the eigenvector corresponding to its only non - vanishing eigenvalue as @xmath173 for convenience we arrive at ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "when both @xmath174 the anti - hermitian part in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can be treated as a perturbation of the hermitian part @xmath11 . in this regime one",
    "expects the zeroes to be located in the vicinity of the real axis in such a way that their height in the complex plane satisfy @xmath175 .",
    "first order perturbation theory results in replacing @xmath176 with @xmath177 where @xmath178 are the eigenvectors of @xmath11 . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath179 is close to @xmath180 , so that the appropriately rescaled variables are @xmath181 .",
    "the probability density @xmath182 in this case can be further evaluated by using the fact that the projections @xmath183 of the eigenvectors of @xmath11 in any arbitrary basis , for large @xmath10 , can be effectively replaced with a set of independent , identically distributed mean - zero gaussian - distributed variables @xmath184 with variance @xmath185 .",
    "this implies , in particular , @xmath186 for both @xmath12 and @xmath13 and all @xmath187 . in this way",
    "one arrives to the mean value of the rescaled imaginary part of zeroes : @xmath188\\ ] ] remembering that in the perturbative regime when @xmath174 we have @xmath189 we see that ( [ meanperturb ] ) matches exactly the large-@xmath120 asymptotics of the moldauer - simonius relation ( [ ms2 ] ) .    further fourier - transforming the @xmath190function",
    "one can easily perform the averaging over eigenvector components and find the distribution of the rescaled imaginary parts as @xmath191 which by further manipulations can be represented in a manifestly real form : @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 is the heaviside step function .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) is a generalization of the porter - thomas distribution for @xmath0 open channels , and is reduced to it in the limit @xmath195 @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is worth briefly discussing how the exact non - perturbative distribution ( [ beta1nonperturb1 ] ) takes the form ( [ 6 ] ) in the weak coupling limit @xmath196 .",
    "in such a limit one can see that the main contribution in ( [ beta1nonperturb1 ] ) comes from the domain @xmath197 whereas @xmath198 .",
    "in such a limit the integrals drastically simplify and one arrives at the following expression : @xmath199 where @xmath200 @xmath201 where the last integral was evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the above manipulations did not assume anything about the value of @xmath202 .",
    "however , the typical values of the variable @xmath202 in the perturbative regime are small : @xmath203 , implying @xmath204 .",
    "the remaining integral over @xmath205 is by a straightforward change of variables reduced to form featuring in ( [ 6 ] ) with @xmath80 , @xmath12 , @xmath206 and assuming @xmath207 , thus confirming the expected correspondence",
    ".    equation ( [ 6 ] ) allow us to evaluate the probability @xmath208 that , for given @xmath133 and @xmath0 , a zero of the @xmath3-matrix crosses the real axis . for @xmath13",
    "one finds @xmath209 while for @xmath12 we have : @xmath210 which in the small @xmath133-limit becomes : @xmath211 equation ( [ 7b ] ) is relevant for cpa protocols , which usually are concerned with situations where the absorber is weak enough to absorb by itself the incident waves .",
    "next let us consider a spectral strip in the complex plane ( say around @xmath180 ) parallel to the imaginary axis , with a width @xmath15 so that it contains on average @xmath212 complex zeroes .",
    "furthermore let us denote with @xmath213 the number of those zeroes which are below the real axis .",
    "these are the number of `` perfect absorbing '' states for a given set of parameters .",
    "its mean then is given by @xmath214 , while @xmath213 itself has the binomial distribution : @xmath215 specifically for @xmath12 , we can calculate the probability to have zero `` perfect absorbers '' in the @xmath216 limit .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ 7b],[8 ] ) , we find @xmath217 which allow us to identify the scaling of the minimal @xmath132 associated with at least one cpa state . specifically by setting @xmath218 and requesting that @xmath219 we get that @xmath220 .",
    "the large value of @xmath221 for @xmath222 is a direct consequence of the fact that , in this limit , the density of zeroes for @xmath33 is strongly depleted .",
    "hence one needs larger values of @xmath1 in order to drive such zeroes through the real axis .",
    "let us give a derivation of the imaginary parts of broad zeroes @xmath223 and @xmath224 for the simplest nontrivial case @xmath80 . to this end , consider the quantity @xmath225 where summation goes over _ all _ @xmath23 complex zeroes of the effective hamiltonian @xmath24 . in the case of @xmath80 such quantity must satisfy the sum rule : @xmath226 . on the other hand ,",
    "the right hand side of the sum rule must remain unaffected after an ensemble average .",
    "therefore we have @xmath227 where @xmath228 indicates an ensemble average , @xmath229 is the density of states and @xmath230 $ ] . in order to perform the integration in eq .",
    "( [ ms3 ] ) we expressed @xmath231 in terms of its rescaled variable @xmath122 which in the case of narrow ( i.e. with the typical imaginary part of order of @xmath62 ) zeroes has been evaluated in eq .",
    "( [ ms2 ] ) .",
    "the last step for the evaluation of the integral is to substitute from eqs .",
    "( [ beta2nonperturb0 ] ) the energy - dependent functions @xmath232 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ ms2 ] ) .",
    "we find that as long as both @xmath233 , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ms3 ] ) is @xmath234 i.e. equal to the left hand side . on the other hand , if either ( or both ) @xmath235 the result of the integration ( right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ms3 ] ) ) is different from one predicted by the exact sum rule ( left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ms3 ] ) ) by an amount @xmath236 or @xmath237 , respectively .",
    "this `` deficit '' is exactly due to the fact that we did not consider in the integration the contribution of broad zeroes which are not captured by the distribution @xmath238 and thus by eq .",

    "<S> our approach assumes that the cavity is coupled with @xmath0 leads and it is described by a rmt model . using non - perturbative calculations we were able to evaluate the density of imaginary parts of @xmath2matrix zeroes . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to calculate the probability of such a zero to move to the negative part of the complex energy plane as the loss - strength at the defect increases . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested our predictions both against direct numerical calculations within the rmt model and with a dynamical system described by a complex networks of coupled waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> our results are `` universal '' and provide new insights into the problem of chaotic coherent perfect absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> specifically they are directly addressing the question of the optimal amount of loss needed to realize a chaotic coherent perfect absorber . </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to extend these studies beyond universality and identify dynamical effects ( like scars etc ) that can further enhance the efficiency of such chaotic cavities to act as cpas . finally , we note that perhaps the easiest way to experimentally test our predictions for @xmath2matrix complex zeroes is to use the correspondence elucidated in the suplemental materials . there </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in the framework of rmt such zeroes are statistically identical to zeroes of the diagonal @xmath143 sub - block of the @xmath144 unitary scattering matrix without absorbers . </S>",
