    "small @xmath0he - rich solar energetic particle ( sep ) events remain @xmath140 years after their discovery one of the less explored phenomenon in solar physics .",
    "the anomalous abundances of @xmath0he - rich seps have been explained by various mechanisms including gyro - resonant interactions with plasma wave turbulence @xcite or interactions with multiple magnetic islands @xcite .",
    "the energy spectra of major ion species in some @xmath0he - rich sep events are power laws or broken power laws but in other events @xmath0he and fe exhibit rounded spectra toward the low energies with @xmath0he rollovers at @xmath1100 - 600kevnucleon@xmath2 and fe rollovers below @xmath1100kevnucleon@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that rounded spectra arise from the basic mechanism of @xmath0he enrichment and power laws involve a further stage of acceleration .",
    "it is well known that power law spectra are produced by shock acceleration models ( see e.g. @xcite , for a review ) but shock detection is not typically reported in @xmath0he - rich sep events ( e.g. , via type ii radio bursts ) .",
    "notice that the spectral shape can deviate from power law when shock propagates into an inhomogeneous solar wind @xcite .",
    "@xmath0he - rich sep sources have been associated with euv jets and jet - like cmes @xcite .",
    "these are signatures of magnetic reconnection involving open field @xcite which may create turbulence and magnetic islands for a particle acceleration . with new observing capabilities on stereo and sdo it has been recently shown that some @xmath0he - rich sep events were associated with large - scale coronal euv waves @xcite .",
    "these waves were found without cmes or only with weak coronal outflows .",
    "a common view on euv waves is that they present or contain magnetosonic waves which can even steepen to the shocks ( see @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine relation between energy spectral characteristics of @xmath0he - rich seps and their flare signatures in the corona .",
    "we examine energy spectra in 32 @xmath0he - rich sep events observed at l1 during solar minimum conditions in 2007 - 2010 .",
    "the events have been examined in detail in our recent survey @xcite .",
    "four events contain a high energy ( @xmath325mev ) but relatively low intensity solar proton component @xcite , which might not be typical @xmath0he events but rather large gradual events or a mix of both .",
    "three of these events show still very high @xmath0he enrichment and all have high fe / o ratio , typical of @xmath0he - rich seps .",
    "note that such cases if not identified may present one source of variability in @xmath0he - rich sep events .",

    "the power law spectrum has been found in 12 events , where 3 events are with jet / brightening and 9 with a coronal wave . the rounded spectral shape is found in 10 events , where 6 are with jet / brightening and 4 with a wave . since in the two class scheme the fe spectrum behaves as @xmath0he , we examined the fe spectrum in the cases where @xmath0he is unclear .",
    "this adds 5 more events .",
    "we found 16 events with @xmath0he or fe having power laws where 4 events were with jet / brightening and 12 with a coronal wave . this confirms the previous finding depending solely on @xmath0he spectrum .",
    "including fe we now have 11 events with rounded spectra where 6 are with jet / brightening and 5 with a wave , again consistent with the previous result .",
    "this shows that events with jet / brightening have a slight tendency to have rounded @xmath0he spectra ( 6 of 9 ) and events with a wave to have power law @xmath0he spectra ( 9 of 13 ) .",
    "this is consistent with a recent study reporting similar tendency for 13 @xmath0he - rich sep events with jets and 4 events with euv waves @xcite .    excluding 4 events with high energy solar proton components ( # 12 , 17 , 21 , 22 ) , which are associated with euv waves and all but one have power law @xmath0he spectra",
    ", the results will not change dramatically .",
    "the @xmath0he - rich sep events with euv waves have still a tendency to have power law @xmath0he spectra ( 6 of 9 ) or power law @xmath0he or fe spectra ( 9 of 13 ) .",
    "exclusion of all events with a high energy proton component may be too conservative as for example one such event , 2009-dec-22 , have very high @xmath0he and fe enrichments ( 386 kevnucleon@xmath2 @xmath0he/@xmath4he@xmath10.23 , fe / o@xmath11.16 ) .",
    "the 2 of 3 above events with the proton component which do not have an occulted source active region ( ar ) have reported type ii radio bursts ( ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov ) .",
    "the cmes which accompany these solar proton events were generally not too fast ( 318 , 486 , 509 , 544 , and 1304 kms@xmath2 as reported by lasco catalog ) .",
    "the slowest one in 2009-dec-22 event was also associated with a type ii radio burst .",
    "we get similar results if we consider coronal wave events only with slow cmes ( @xmath6350 kms@xmath2 ) or with no cme : @xmath0he power law spectrum in 5 from 7 events and @xmath0he ( or fe ) power law in 7 from 10 events .    in our earlier study",
    "@xcite we report rounded @xmath0he , fe spectra in the event with a weak euv wave , probably without a significant influence on energetic ions .",
    "therefore we look at the wave associated events with @xmath0he rounded spectra ( 2010-feb-19 , 2010-sep-1 , 2010-nov-2 , 2010-nov-29 ) . the coronal wave in february 19 event",
    "was ejected about 30 min earlier , not at the time of the type iii radio burst .",
    "note this is the only case in this survey when the wave was not co - temporal with the flare and/or type iii burst . though overall the wave looks quite significant in the february 19 event ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , maybe it was ejected too early to have an effect on the later particle injection .",
    "the wave in the september 1 event had a large spatial scale but faded before reaching the l1 foot - point . the february 19 and",
    "september 1 events have all @xmath4he , @xmath0he , o , fe spectra rounded , the feature has not been previously reported ( see later ) .",
    "the november 2 and november 29 events are associated with quite narrow waves with less bright fronts .",
    "furthermore the november 2 wave has the narrowest front in this study and the source ar in the november 29 event was extraordinary separated from the nominal magnetic connection .",
    "thus the influence of the waves on energetic ion spectra in these two events would be minimal .",
    "we have also 3 events with power law @xmath0he spectra ( 2007-jan-14 , 2009-oct-6 , 2010-jan-16 ) associated with a brightening or a jet .",
    "the october 6 event spectrum could be still rounded as we do not have spectral points below 400 kevnucleon@xmath2 .",
    "other two events have one , the lowest energy ( 100 kevnucleon@xmath2 ) spectral point , deviated from the power law dependence but this can be an instrumental issue .",
    "it has been discussed that propagation through interplanetary space is probably not a cause of a common spectral shapes observed in @xmath0he - rich sep events @xcite .",
    "indeed , the 2007 january 14 event is a short duration event with a non - dispersive onset while the 2010 january 16 event is a dispersive one , though both have similar , power law , spectral shapes .",
    "the 2009 october 6 event is too weak to observe a velocity dispersion . in this study about half of the events with rounded @xmath0he spectra have a dispersive onset ( 6 of 10 ; 1 event with unclear dispersion ) indicating nearly scatter - free propagation and half of the events with power law @xmath0he spectra have non - dispersive onsets ( 6 of 12 ; 2 events are unclear ) .",
    "we found several @xmath0he - rich sep events which differ from the two class scheme introduced in @xcite .",
    "for example the following two events have only the @xmath0he spectrum rounded , while the fe is power law : the 2010 november 17 event and maybe also the 2010 november 14 event .",
    "neither of these is associated with a coronal wave and both have the same solar source .",
    "since we could not see this feature in other events ( and no other reports are known ) this may be due to specific conditions in a particular solar source region .",
    "however note on some other events where fe shows a clear power law shape , @xmath0he looks more complex ( e.g. , 2008-nov-4 , 2010-jan-27 ) which might be of the previous type .",
    "furthermore we found other events where all @xmath4he , @xmath0he , o , fe spectra are rounded .",
    "typical examples are the events of 2010 september 1 ( already mentioned ) and 2010 september 4 .",
    "the september 1 event is particularly unusual , with the @xmath4he spectrum continuing to rise at the lowest energies after the turnover .",
    "these two events are associated with different ars : september 1 with a coronal wave and a high speed cme ( with @xmath325mev proton event ) and september 4 with a brightening .",
    "there is possibly another @xmath0he - rich sep event with all spectra rounded , the above mentioned 2010 february 19 event . here after a turnover the fe spectrum continues to rise at the lowest energies .",
    "this event was associated with a brightening but the wave ejected earlier was still present during the type iii burst . rounded @xmath4he spectra",
    "have been predicted by a mhd turbulence model at lower ( @xmath620kevnucleon@xmath2 ) energies @xcite not covered by available instruments .",
    "we examined energy spectra for 32 @xmath0he - rich sep events and identified @xmath0he spectral shapes for 22 events .",
    "we found a slight tendency for events with jets / brightenings in their solar source to have a rounded @xmath0he spectrum and for events with coronal waves in their source to have a power law @xmath0he spectrum .",
    "though more events need to be examined to confirm this tendency the second stage mechanism behind the @xmath0he - rich sep acceleration may be related to coronal euv waves even when cmes are not seen or are represented only by slow white - light outflows .    half of the events with rounded @xmath0he spectra ( 5 of 10 ) show peculiar behaviour not previously reported .",
    "we noticed events where clearly only the @xmath0he spectrum is rounded and also events where all major species show rounded spectra .",
    "this may present further constraints on modelling of ion acceleration / propagation in @xmath0he - rich sep events .",
