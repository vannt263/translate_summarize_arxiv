    "stars are formed predominantly from very large clouds of cold interstellar gas containing up to millions of solar masses of material .",
    "the dynamics of such clouds is therefore a crucial ingredient in the process of star formation .",
    "observations of emission spectra of molecular transitions have shown that the kinematics of star ",
    "forming clouds is best described as supersonic random motions , often referred to as supersonic turbulence .",
    "numerical simulations of supersonic turbulence have indeed been compared successfully with the observations , in the sense that many statistical properties of numerical supersonic turbulent flows are also found in the observational data ( e.g. padoan et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 , 2001 ) .    the cold gas in star ",
    "forming clouds , especially their molecular component , cools very rapidly down to a typical equilibrium temperature of approximately 10  k. the shocks caused by the observed random supersonic velocity field are therefore roughly isothermal , which allows them to compress the gas effectively .",
    "expansions are also favored by the isothermal behavior of the gas and large voids of very low density can be generated .",
    "the result is a very large contrast between the highest and the lowest densities , as commonly found in numerical simulations with an isothermal equation of state .",
    "we usually refer to this effect of the turbulent velocity on the density field as _ turbulent fragmentation _ , to stress the fact that star",
    " forming clouds are more likely fragmented into dense prestellar cores directly by the turbulent velocity field , rather than by a hierarchical process of gravitational fragmentation .    the traditional way to study the dynamics of star forming clouds is to probe their kinematics by the doppler shift in spectral lines of molecular transitions .",
    "however , the dynamics can also be studied through the density field , as the gas density is so strongly affected by the supersonic velocity .",
    "the investigation of the cloud spatial structure may be used to test predictions of numerical and analytical models more directly than using the velocity field .",
    "projected density is in fact easier to measure than the velocity field .",
    "this is especially true if stellar extinction measurements are available , since they provide the most reliable estimate of column density .",
    "thanks to the recently completed `` two micron all sky survey '' ( 2mass ; cutri et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is now possible to generate extinction maps of several extended giant molecular cloud complexes with a dynamical range in both column density and spatial resolution that is not matched by any molecular line survey . in this work",
    "we derive new extinction maps of the taurus region using 2mass point source data , and show that we can probe values of dust column density over more than two orders of magnitude and achieve a spatial resolution higher than in iras 100  @xmath1 m images (   2 ) . in",
    "  3 we present the results of the structure function analysis of the extinction map and obtain a scaling that is indistinguishable from that of the velocity structure functions in supersonic turbulence .",
    "conclusions are drawn in   4 .",
    "lada et al . ( 1994 ) use the stellar extinction determined from the ir color excess , instead of stellar counts , to map interstellar clouds .",
    "their method is based on superimposing a regular grid on the observed region , and giving each grid cell a value of extinction equal to the average extinction of the stars within that cell .",
    "the number of stars per cell decreases with increasing average extinction in the cell , because only the brightest background stars can be seen through a large column of dust .",
    "the method has been improved by lombardi & alves ( 2001 ) , using gaussian filtering to obtain a smooth regularly sampled map .    in this work",
    "we compute stellar extinction maps with the method proposed by cambresy et al .",
    "this method uses adaptive cells that contain a fixed number of stars instead of cells of fixed size . in this way it is possible to keep the spatial resolution as high as allowed by the local stellar density . the spatial resolution is higher in regions of low extinction than in regions of large extinction , where fewer background stars are detected and larger cells must be used .",
    "the average spatial resolution over the whole map can be changed by changing the number of stars per cell ."
