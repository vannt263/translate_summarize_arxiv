    "recent progress in the study of the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) has shown that discrete sources probably account for the entire xrb ( e.g. hasinger et al .",
    "although broad line qsos account for @xmath14 of the 0.5 - 2.0 kev xrb ( boyle et al . 1994 , geogantopoulos et al . 1996 ) , at higher energies ( @xmath15 2 kev ) , the qso spectrum with energy spectral index @xmath16 is too soft to account for the xrb for which @xmath17 ( gendreau et al . 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , qsos are significantly more clustered than the diffuse component of the xrb ( geograntopoulos et al .",
    "1993 , soltan & hasinger 1994 ) .",
    "the emission from seyfert nuclei is somewhat harder , @xmath18 , but still too soft to account for the xrb unless there is a large population of highly absorbed seyferts ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have successfully modeled the amplitude and general shape of the xrb spectrum with a unified active galactic nuclei ( agn ) model that includes such sources ; however , the characteristic reflection feature in the obscured seyfert spectrum ( e.g. ghisellini et al . 1994 ) has not been observed in the xrb ( gendreau et al .",
    "x - ray spectra of starburst galaxies are too soft and their luminosities too low to make a significant contribution ( della - ceca et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "one possible resolution to this problem would be a population of `` x - ray galaxies '' which are relatively faint but have intrinsically hard spectra .",
    "this possibility has become especially interesting since the recent discovery of narrow emission line galaxies with nuclear x - ray luminosities @xmath20 ( georgantopoulos et al .",
    "1996 , griffiths et al .",
    "such sources are @xmath21 times more luminous than `` normal '' field galaxies ( fabbiano 1989 ) and yet fainter than typical agn .",
    "if a significant fraction of narrow emission line galaxies are similar x - ray sources then they could make a substantial contribution to the xrb .",
    "the emission mechanism in these sources is still unknown .",
    "if nuclear emission in x - ray galaxies were to arise from accretion disks around massive black holes , i.e. the standard agn mechanism , and if the central black hole masses are similar to those of agn , then the mass accretion rates would be orders of magnitude lower than for typical agn ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the relatively low x - ray luminosity could be due to the low radiative efficiency expected in hot advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) ( e.g. rees et al .",

    ", the accretion rates could be similar to those of agn ( e.g. yi 1996 ) .",
    "this possibility is especially interesting since x - ray emission spectra from adafs are intrinsically hard enough to account for the xrb ( di matteo & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "we suggest that these two possible x - ray emission mechanisms can be distinguished by the radio emission which is inherent to adafs .",
    "the radio detection of such sources at distances @xmath22 would have important implications on the masses of black holes as well as on the xrb .",
    "we adopt the the following dimensionless variables ; mass of the black hole @xmath23 , cylindrical radius from the black hole @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the schwartzschild radius ) , and mass accretion rate @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the eddington accretion rate assuming a 10% efficiency , @xmath28 .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background intensity at energy @xmath29 is given by = c4h_0_0^z_cdzj[e(1+z),z](1+z)^2(1+_0z)^1/2 where @xmath30 is the usual cosmological density parameter , @xmath31 is the comoving volume emissivity , and @xmath32 is the hubble constant . for discrete sources with individual differential luminosity @xmath33 and comoving number density @xmath34 , @xmath35=n(z)dl / de(z)|_{e(1+z)}$ ] .",
    "we assume that the sources exist up to redshift @xmath36 .",
    "if the emissivity evolution is driven by the pure luminosity evolution ( i.e. without significant spectral or number density evolution ) , one can roughly estimate the number density required to account for the observed x - ray background .",
    "for pure luminosity evolution of the form @xmath37 and a power - law spectrum @xmath38 , the integrated x - ray background between the energies @xmath39 and @xmath40 is i_xrb=_e_1^e_2 de dide = cnl_122h_0 ( 2k-2_x-3)where @xmath41 and @xmath42 has been assumed for simplicity",

    "they also found that the x - ray luminosity of these faint galaxies evolves as @xmath57 with a comoving emissivity at the present epoch of @xmath58 in the rosat band .",
    "if integrated to @xmath47 , @xmath59% of the 0.5 - 2kev xrb and @xmath60% of the total xrb are accounted for .",
    "this tentative conclusion emphasizes the need for better understanding of the x - ray emission mechanism from faint sources .",
    "when the density of the accretion flow is sufficiently low , the radiative cooling rate becomes smaller than the viscous heating rate . as a result ,",
    "the dissipated accretion energy is not efficiently radiated away but kept as internal heat and advected inward with the accreted plasma ( rees et al .",
    "1982 , narayan & yi 1995 and references therein ) . in advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) ,",
    "ions reach a very high temperature ( close to the virial temperature ) , the energy transfer from ions to electrons becomes slow , and the radiative cooling by electrons remains very inefficient .",

    "the adaf emission depends on the ratio @xmath65 so solutions with different @xmath62 s are equivalent if @xmath66 is appropriately rescaled .",
    "the viscous heating rate is balanced by the energy advection rate @xmath67 per unit volume and the rate of energy transfer to electrons @xmath68 per unit volume ; q_+=q_adv+q_e+ . when the radiative cooling is inefficient , the accreted plasma becomes hot and the internal ( thermal and magnetic ) pressure becomes comparable to the kinetic pressure .",
    "the dependence of emission on the magnetic field is more important ( e.g. rees 1982 , narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "we adopt the equipartition condition that the magnetic pressure is equal to @xmath69 the total internal pressure .",
    "then the magnetic field in the adaf is ( narayan & yi 1995 ) b1.110 ^ 4 m_7 ^ -1/2m_-3 ^ 1/2 r^-5/4   gauss where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "hot electrons in magnetic fields radiate through the emission of synchrotron photons , the comptonization of synchrotron photons , and bremsstrahlung for which we take @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 as the corresponding rates per unit volume .",

    "the results depend very weakly on @xmath81 .",
    "figure 1 shows radio luminosity @xmath82 at four different frequencies ( 1.4 , 5 , 15 , 20 ghz ) as a function of x - ray luminosity in two x - ray bands ( 0.5 - 2 , 2 - 10 kev ) . for each black hole mass ,",
    "luminosities are calculated for @xmath83 . the lower value of @xmath84 roughly corresponds to the limit above which the electron heating is dominated by the coulomb coupling ( e.g. mahadevan 1996 ) .",
    "the upper limit in principle corresponds to @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "we note , however , that the exact physical nature of the adaf for @xmath87 is poorly understood .",
    "therefore , luminosity curves for @xmath87 ( the far right hand part of the curves in figure 1 ; see also figure 2 ) are suspect ( narayan & yi 1995 ) . in each panel , from bottom to top , the black hole mass increases as @xmath88 .",
    "the curves are steeper at low luminosities and flatter at high luminosities .",
    "this trend is caused by the change in the dominant x - ray emission mechanism . at lower luminosities ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is mainly contributed by bremsstrahlung ; whereas , at high luminosities compton scattering becomes important ( e.g. rees et al .",

    "the results shown in figure 1 can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "optically thin synchrotron emission extends to the self - absorption frequency , @xmath89 , at which the rayleigh - jeans blackbody emission equals the optically thin synchrotron emission .",

    "min=_max(r_max / r_min)^-5/4 .",
    "when the accretion rate @xmath84 is substantially lower than @xmath85 , the x - ray emission comes mainly from the bremsstrahlung emission ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "compton scattering contributes significantly when the mass accretion rate approaches the critical rate @xmath99 a few @xmath100 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity due to the bremsstrahlung emission is l_x ( ) l_^brem 210 ^ 39 m_7 m_-3 ^ 2 t_e9 ^ -3/2_18   erg  s^-1 where @xmath101 and we have assumed that @xmath102 is smaller than the electron rest energy .",

    "@xmath92 is approximately independent of @xmath84 and @xmath110 , and @xmath111 ( mahadevan 1996 ) .",
    "then , since @xmath112 , we immediately arrive at @xmath113 which qualitatively accounts for the low x - ray luminosity , steeper parts of the curves in figure 1 . on the other hand , when @xmath106 , the x - ray photons in the 0.5 - 10 kev range are contributed primarily by compton up - scattered synchrotron photons .",

    "@xmath116 , @xmath117 .",

    "thus @xmath119 and @xmath120 which accounts for the flatter parts of the curves in figure 1 . while this argument describes the qualitative shape of the luminosity relations , more detailed calculations give an even smaller slope at high @xmath121 .    the typical radio spectrum peaks at frequencies @xmath122 ( eqs . 3 - 5,3 - 6 ) so the radio to x - ray luminosity ratio increases with radio frequency .",
    "the radio / x - ray luminosity relation shown in figure 1 can be approximated by l_r = l _ 710 ^ 35 m_7 l_x,40 ^ 1/10 ( /15ghz)^7/5   erg  s^-1 where @xmath123 is the x - ray luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev band and we have approximated the exponents to the closest simple fractions . despite the change in slope of the luminosity curves in figure 1 ,",
    "this simple radio / x - ray luminosity relation is valid to within a factor of 2 in the luminosity range @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath12 is strongly dependent on @xmath110 and only mildly dependent on @xmath121 , the observed radio luminosity provides an imporant constraint on the mass of the central black hole . on the other hand",
    ", the inverted radio spectrum provides an important signature of the adaf mechanism and indicates the importance of high frequency ( @xmath125 ) observations .",
    "when the accretion rate becomes higher than @xmath85 , the low radiative efficiency adafs no longer exist ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "these flows differ from adafs mainly due to their high radiative efficiency . if the accretion flows of the low luminosity galactic nuclei are similar to those of high luminosity seyferts and qsos ( e.g. frank et al .",

    "for instance ,",
    "@xmath126 with @xmath6 requires @xmath127 whereas the adafs would require @xmath84 roughly two orders of magnitude higher . since the high efficiency accretion flows are most likely to occur in the form of the thin disk ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) , a clear correlation between the radio emission and the x - ray emission comparable to eq .",
    "( 3 - 10 ) is not expected .",
    "radio emission provides a characteristic signature for adaf sources ; however , the fluxes are relatively low and undetectable for distant sources . for example",
    ", an adaf source with x - ray luminosity @xmath128 and mass @xmath129 at @xmath130 has a @xmath131 flux of @xmath132 .",
    "in addition , resolving small nuclear regions at this distance is problematic . on the other hand ,",
    "if adaf sources are responsible for a significant fraction of the xrb then their required number density , @xmath133 ( see  2 ) , is a significant fraction of the density of field galaxies and they should be easily observable in the local universe . if an x - ray bright galaxy contains an adaf with @xmath134 , the 20 ghz radio luminosity is expected to be @xmath135 .",
    "such a galaxy would be detected as a @xmath136 radio source out to a distance of @xmath137 .",
    "high resolution 10 and 20 ghz observations of nearby sources would test the prediction that the radio spectra are inverted and careful x - ray observations ( e.g. by asca ) would test the predicted hardness of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "in fact , a large effort to characterize the spectrum of liners and low - luminosity agns at many wavelengths is already underway ( ho 1997 ) and should provide a test of the general characteristics of the adaf mechanism in these sources .",
    "recently falcke et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported the result of their 15 ghz radio survey of 48 nearby liners optically observed by ho et al .",
    "nuclear radio emission above the @xmath138 flux limit was detected in 25% of the liners .",
    "the observed luminosities are the right order of magnitude but further observations at different radio frequencies would be very useful .",
    "sgr a@xmath139 in our galactic center has an x - ray luminosity @xmath140 and perhaps @xmath141 ( koyama et al . 1996 ) and a 20 ghz radio luminosity of @xmath142 .",
    "if the black hole mass is @xmath143 ( eckart & genzel 1996 ) , then the observed luminosity ratio is within a factor of @xmath144 of that predicted for an adaf source .",
    "sgr a@xmath139 and several other sources are plotted in figure 2 along with theoretical curves of the luminosity ratio , @xmath145 .",
    "we conclude that galactic nuclei similar to ours could indeed harbor an adaf ( narayan et al .",
    "on the other hand , extragalactic nuclei with such low luminosities would be extremely difficult to detect even if they are relatively nearby .      for a galactic nucleus with a black hole mass @xmath146 , which is often adopted for seyferts ,",
    "the adaf mechanism implies a significantly higher radio luminosity than that of sgr a@xmath139 .",
    "also plotted in figure 2 is ngc 4258 which has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath147 ( makishima et al .",
    "1994 ) and a black hole mass @xmath148 ( miyoshi et al . 1995 ) . from equation ( 3 - 10 )",
    ", the expected @xmath149 radio luminosity is @xmath150 .",
    "turner & ho ( 1994 ) report a marginally resolved , compact nuclear radio source at @xmath149 in ngc 4258 . assuming a distance of @xmath151 ( sandage 1996 ) , this implies a point source luminosity of @xmath152 .",
    "we conclude that it is possible that ngc 4258 is powered by an adaf ( lasota et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "ngc 4258 belongs to a group of the emission line galaxies , liners ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "( 1995 ) find that nearly one - third of all nearby galaxies with b magnitude @xmath153 are liners .",
    "moreover , a substantial fraction of them contain broad line regions which suggest that these sources may be powered by accretion flows similar to those in agn ( filippenko & sargent 1985 ) .",
    "due to relatively low x - ray luminosities and hard x - ray emission , liners are prime candidates for adafs .",
    "it is , however , unclear whether the accretion occurs in the form of an adaf or a high efficiency accretion disk as in seyferts ( e.g. lasota et al .",
    "1996 ) . since the liners are classified solely based on the optical line ratios , the liners as a class may be highly heterogeneous .",
    "it can not be ruled out that some of the galaxies have adafs and some have low luminosity versions of the agn accretion flows .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the seyfert type liners could have higher x - ray luminosities but relatively lower nuclear radio luminosities than adaf type liners . in this regard",
    ", the adaf radio / x - ray luminosity relation is particularly promising in distinguishing the x - ray emission mechanism in emission line galaxies . for seyferts with thin disc accretion and radio jets",
    ", the extended radio emission could be much larger than indicated by equation ( 3 - 10 ) .    from a cursory search of the literature we identified 8 liners ( ngc 3031 , 3079 , 3627 , 3628 , 4258 , 4486 , 4736 , 5194 ) with both measured x - ray fluxes and high angular resolution ( @xmath154 ) , high frequency ( @xmath155 ) radio fluxes .",
    "the ratios of radio luminosity to x - ray luminosity for these sources are plotted in figure 2 along with adaf curves for black hole masses ranging from @xmath156 to @xmath157 . for two sources ( ngc 3627 and 4736 ) we computed the @xmath52 fluxes from the @xmath158 rosat fluxes assuming an @xmath159 power law . the error in this extrapolation factor",
    "is @xmath160 for a range of spectra from hard to soft .",
    "we also computed the @xmath149 radio flux of ngc 3627 from the reported @xmath161 flux and of ngc 4486 from the reported @xmath162 flux using the predicted @xmath163 power law ( equation 3 - 5 ) .",

    "also in figure 2 , we show the luminosity ratios of 5 typical radio - quiet seyfert galaxies for comparison .",
    "even @xmath154 resolution is far too large to resolve the radio emitting region of adafs .",
    "for example , at 10 mpc @xmath164 corresponds to 50 pc compared to the expected @xmath165 size of the adaf emitting region . to the extent that there are other radio sources , e.g. hii regions or radio jets , in the radio beam",
    ", then the ratios of figure 2 should be considered upper limits .",
    "of course the resolution of the x - ray observations is even worse ; however , it seems unlikely that there are other x - ray sources with luminosities @xmath166 within @xmath167 of the nucleus .",
    "if there are such sources then they would have the effect of artificially lowering the luminosity ratio .",
    "knowledege of the x - ray and radio spectra would help clarify these issues .",
    "we caution that the list of sources is neither unbiased nor complete .",
    "we do not intend the plot to be strong evidence for the existence of the adaf mechanism in these sources ; rather , only to be suggestive that this might be the case . in any case",
    ", the uncertainty of black hole masses in these systems coupled with the strong dependence of radio luminosity on black hole mass preclude a detailed comparison of observations and predictions . nevertheless , most of the sources in figure 2 appear to be consistent with the predicted adaf luminosity ratios for black hole masses @xmath168 ( ngc 3079 and ngc 4486 are separately discussed below ) .",
    "it is gratifying that the black hole masses are close to those often invoked for seyfert - type agn ( e.g. padovani 1989 ) .",
    "low luminosity seyferts with @xmath169 could also be powered by adafs .",
    "the five examples of seyferts shown in figure 2 are accounted for by the adaf emission if they contain black holes with masses @xmath170 .",
    "if their radio emission is from an adaf , the positions of the seyferts would imply that the sources are accreting at higher accretion rates closer to the theoretical maximum @xmath85 than the liners shown . on the other hand ,",
    "if the seyferts contain high radiative efficiency flows , the mass accretion rates and black hole masses could be substantially lower than those estimated in figure 2 .",
    "then the radio emission is most likely due to a radio jet - like emission mechanism . in this case",
    ", high resolution radio observations could reveal the radio jets .",
    "ngc 1068 and 4151 do appear to contain jet - like features ( e.g. wilson & ulvestad 1982 ) .",
    "ngc 1068 has a relatively strong compact nuclear radio source at the subarcsecond scale ( gallimore et al .",
    "1996 ) , which results in a much higher radio / x - ray flux ratio than the rest of the seyferts shown in figure 2 .",
    "the radio emission from an adaf can explain such a high ratio only if @xmath171 .",
    "if ngc 1068 s black hole mass is typical of seyferts , i.e. @xmath172 , the relatively high radio luminosity might indicate small - scale radio jet activity .",
    "however , given the small linear scale @xmath173 ( gallimore et al .",
    "1996 ) , radio emission from an adaf seems more likely . if the latter is the case , then the black hole mass is estimated to be close to @xmath174 .",
    "it should be noted that starburst activity in ngc 1068 contributes to the nuclear , hard x - ray emission ( e.g. ueno et al .",
    "ngc 4151 is a variable x - ray source so we used the mean @xmath175 kev flux ( papadakis & mchardy 1995 ) .",
    "the high radio to x - ray ratio of ngc 3079 also implies a black hole mass as high as @xmath174 .",
    "this is also the case for the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 4486 ( m87 ) .",
    "for m87 the dynamical estimates of the black hole mass , @xmath176 , ( harms et al .",
    "1994 ) are indeed consistent with the position of the source in figure 2 .",
    "ngc 4486 does have a radio jet ; however , the radio flux quoted here is from a vlbi measurement ( moellenbrock et al .",
    "1996 ) and corresponds to a spatial resolution of @xmath177 .",
    "the similarity between the type 2 seyfert ngc 1068 and the two liners ngc 3079 , 4486 is intriguing and it may suggest a common emission mechanism in the two different types of active galaxies with comparable luminosities .",
    "generally , radio - loud galactic nuclei populate the upper right region of figure 2 .",
    "ngc 3079 , 4486 , and 1068 are relatively radio loud and so it is crucial to extract the compact nuclear radio emission ( i.e. excluding contribution from extended radio lobes ) .",
    "high angular resolution radio observations at two frequencies would improve the situation considerably by replacing the upper limits with actual detection of point sources and by testing whether or not the sources have the predicted inverted spectrum . measurements of the x - ray spectral index would further test the adaf emission mechanism .",
    "recent developments in the study of the x - ray background indicate the necessity of relatively faint , hard - spectrum x - ray sources . these sources could be either heavily obscured low luminosity agn or x - ray bright emission line galaxies .",
    "the implied luminosity of these x - ray bright galaxies is similar to that of liners and other narrow emission line galaxies and it has been suggested that nearly 1/3 of all nearby galaxies are liners ( ho et al .",
    "a prime candidate for the emission mechanism of x - ray bright galaxies is adaf onto a central , massive black hole .",
    "while classical , bright agn are expected to have weak radio emission ( unless they have radio jets ) , adaf sources exhibit high frequency radio emission from a hot synchrotron - emitting plasma .",
    "the radio luminosities of adafs are modest ( observations at 20 ghz would only be able to detect them to distances of @xmath178 ) ; however , the characteristic inverted radio spectrum provides an observational test for the adaf paradigm .",
    "if adafs are unambiguously detected , the radio / x - ray luminosity relation provides a direct estimate of the central black hole mass .",
    "several nearby liners have radio to x - ray luminosity ratios that are consistent with the adaf predictions ; however , more observations are needed to test the predictions presented in this paper .",
    "an important consequence of the inherently inefficient adaf mechanism is the implied growth rate for the masses of the central black holes .",
    "if a typical source @xmath52 luminosity at @xmath179 is @xmath6 , and if the sources undergo the luminosity evolution of the form @xmath180 up to redshift 2 ( as suggested by almaini et al .",
    "1997 ) , then at @xmath181 , the source has a luminosity of @xmath182 which is similar to the luminosities of some x - ray bright galaxies ( griffiths et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) . the approximate minimum black hole mass for these sources consistent with adaf emission can be estimated by equating this luminosity with the maximum bremsstrahlung luminosity expected from the adaf accretion flow .",
    "the maximum @xmath52 band limited flux is @xmath183 ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "then the the minimum black hole mass at @xmath181 is @xmath184 .",
    "an estimate of the current black hole mass for these sources at @xmath179 is obtained by assuming that these sources continue to accrete at a rate @xmath185 from @xmath181 to @xmath179 ( cf . yi 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting black hole mass , @xmath186 , is similar to the typical black hole mass assumed for seyfert galaxies and the black hole mass observed in ngc 4258 .",
    "this rough estimate is not intended to be a prediction of the current mass spectrum of galactic black holes but rather to check whether or not the adaf mechanism violates current estimates of central black hole masses .",
    "we have hypothesized that adafs around central black holes in galaxies generates a substantial component of the hard x - ray background .",
    "this requires that a significant fraction of galaxies harbor central black holes with adaf flows .",
    "however , even if the number density of adaf sources is too small to contribute significantly to the xrb ( cf .",
    "di matteo & fabian 1997 ) , adafs are still interesting for x - ray bright emission line galaxies and the observational tests suggested here are useful probes of the x - ray emission mechanism .",
    "we would like to thank ramesh narayan for information on the spectral states of accreting black holes and roeland van der marel for helpful discussions on black hole masses .",
