    "moreover , the sum of the @xmath27-weights of the branches of @xmath456 which are not contained in @xmath457 is independent of @xmath453 .",
    "thus the sum of the @xmath458-weights of the branches of @xmath456 which are _ not _ contained in @xmath457 is smaller than @xmath459 . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath460 then the @xmath461-weight of @xmath462 does not exceed @xmath108 and the same holds true for the @xmath463-weight of @xmath464 which shows our above claim .",
    "together we deduce the existence of a number @xmath415 such that for @xmath416 the set @xmath465 is invariant under the map @xmath21 which assigns to a measured geodesic lamination @xmath466 the normalized image of @xmath467 under a carrying map @xmath468 . now if @xmath469 and if @xmath470 is such that @xmath471 is a cotangent vector of the axis of @xmath392 then @xmath472 spans the ray @xmath394 and therefore necessarily @xmath473 .",
    "let @xmath416 and let @xmath474 be such that the total weight of the transverse measure on @xmath475 defined by the measured geodesic lamination @xmath476 equals one .",
    "recall from lemma 2.5 of @xcite that the intersection of @xmath476 with the embedded trainpath @xmath380 on @xmath475 is bounded from above by the sum of the @xmath476-weights of the branches of @xmath477 . by our above consideration",
    ", we may assume that for @xmath416 this weight is bounded from above by @xmath108 .",
    "as a consequence , for every @xmath478 the intersection of @xmath380 with the horizontal measured geodesic lamination of the quadratic differential @xmath479 is at most @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath480 be such that the total weight of @xmath481 on @xmath448 equals one , that the total weight of @xmath482 on @xmath483 equals one , that the total weight of @xmath484 on @xmath485 equals one and that the total weight of @xmath486 on @xmath393 equals one .",
    "note that @xmath487 is the length of the periodic orbit of the teichmller flow defined by the conjugacy class of @xmath392 .",
    "using once more our above consideration we conclude that for @xmath416 and every @xmath488 the intersection of the horizontal measured geodesic lamination of the quadratic differential @xmath479 with the curve @xmath489 is bounded from above by @xmath108 .",
    "our proposition now follows if for sufficiently large @xmath204 we can control the intersections of the curves @xmath490 with the vertical measured geodesic laminations for the quadratic differentials @xmath479 . for",
    "this let again @xmath491 be such that @xmath470 and @xmath492 .",
    "since a carrying map @xmath493 maps every branch @xmath24 of @xmath494 _ onto _ @xmath495 and since @xmath496 by our above consideration , the @xmath481-weight of every branch of @xmath448 which is contained in @xmath497 is bounded from below by a universal constant @xmath302 not depending on @xmath204 .",
    "then the @xmath498-weight of every such branch is bounded from above by @xmath306 and hence there is a number @xmath336 not depending on @xmath204 which bounds from above the @xmath499-weight of every branch of @xmath500 .",
    "now the curve @xmath501 is an embedded trainpath in the train track @xmath500 and hence our upper bound for the values of @xmath499 on the branches of @xmath494 implies that the intersection between @xmath501 and @xmath499 is uniformly bounded . as we increase @xmath204 , the ratios @xmath502 tend to infinity ( compare the above consideration ) and hence after possibly increasing @xmath503 we may assume that for every @xmath416 we have @xmath504 . by invariance of the intersection form under the action of @xmath9 we conclude that for every @xmath416 and every @xmath505 the intersection between the vertical measured geodesic lamination of @xmath479 and @xmath380 is bounded from above by @xmath108 .",
    "this then shows that for every @xmath506 $ ] the sum of the intersection numbers between @xmath380 and the vertical and the horizontal measured geodesic lamination of @xmath507 does not exceed @xmath508 . in other words , for every such @xmath509 the @xmath479-length of @xmath380 is bounded from above by @xmath510 .",
    "the same argument shows that after possibly increasing @xmath503 once more we may assume that for @xmath416 and every @xmath511 $ ] the @xmath479-length of @xmath512 is bounded from above by @xmath510 . by periodicity",

    "the stable length of each of the ( infinitely many ) pseudo - anosov elements @xmath392 constructed in the proof of proposition 5.6 is at most 2 .",
