    "<S> we demonstrate top - gate tunable josephson junction like behavior in the two dimensional electron gas at the laalo@xmath0-srtio@xmath0 interface . a combination of global back - gating and local top - gating is used to define the junctions , providing an efficient way for much finer spatial control over the properties of the interface , as compared to back - gating alone . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of critical currents and zero bias resistances with temperature shows that the junctions behave like short , overdamped weak links . </S>",
    "<S> this technique could be an important tool to illuminate the nature of superconductivity in the laalo@xmath0-srtio@xmath0 interface system .    </S>",
    "<S> the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interface of the insulating oxides laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) , has attracted a lot of attention since its discovery in 2004 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the 2deg undergoes a superconducting transition below about 300 mk @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important question is the nature of superconductivity , as it occurs in two dimensions , in an environment of strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite , and in coexistence with magnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various theories have been proposed to explain superconductivity in this system , including a fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov state @xcite , a mixed parity state @xcite , and a conventional superconducting state involving electrons from @xmath1 orbitals in a few tio@xmath2 layers of sto next to the interface@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> penetration depth experiments @xcite point to doubly gapped _ s_-wave superconductivity with strong coupling , whereas out - of - plane tunneling measurements do not rule out other symmetries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a clear consensus is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> phase sensitive tests involving josephson junctions ( jj ) are an important tool to garner information about the order parameter symmetry of a superconductor @xcite . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate josephson junction like behavior in the 2deg at the lao - sto interface .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the 2deg at the lao - sto interface can be tuned through a superconductor - insulator transition ( sit ) by the application of a back - gate @xcite or top - gate voltage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of superconductivity is a nonmonotonic function of the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a handy way to define tunable barriers in this system , with fine spatial control , using a combination of local top - gates and a global back - gate . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that by applying appropriate top - gate voltages , we can tune the area underneath the top - gate from a superconductor , through a normal metal , to finally an insulator .    </S>",
    "<S> we measured two devices , both of which showed similar behavior , corresponding to short , overdamped junctions . in the remainder of the paper </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on one of these devices . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows a scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of the device , which was fabricated on 10 unit cells of lao grown epitaxially by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) on tio@xmath2 terminated ( 001 ) sto . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the pld synthesis are discussed in earlier papers @xcite . using photolithography and ar ion milling , hall bars of width 100 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 m were patterned onto the sample . </S>",
    "<S> earlier measurements showed that deposition of the top - gate electrode directly on top of lao can lead to shorting of the top - gate and the 2deg after just a few sweeps of the top - gate voltage , @xmath4 , even though lao itself is an insulator . </S>",
    "<S> hence we used e - beam lithography and e - beam evaporation of 70 nm of sio@xmath2 in an oxygen atmosphere to define an additional insulating layer , covering one of the sections of the hall bar between two pairs of voltage probes . </S>",
    "<S> this was done in order to have a more reliable barrier between the top - gate and 2deg , so that we could use a larger range of values of @xmath4 and hence go deeper into the insulating regime of the 2deg . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the same lithography techniques were used to deposit ti / au for the top - gate on top of the sio@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the top - gated region in its narrowest section was a strip of length 6 @xmath5 m and width 180 nm . for certain values of @xmath4 and temperature , @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , we expect the area underneath the top - gate to be non - superconducting , and the 180 nm wide section to be the least resistance path for the current , as we discuss below . if the superconducting correlations of the two non - top - gated superconducting banks on either side of the top - gated region can be supported across this 180 nm wide section , then all current would flow only through it , thus defining a weak link , or a jj , between the banks .        </S>",
    "<S> measurements were performed using a standard lockin amplifier technique with a srs124 lockin amplifier and a home built current source , with an ac excitation frequency of 107 hz and amplitude @xmath7 10 na . </S>",
    "<S> an agilent synthesizer and a home - built summer were used to apply a dc current bias . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was measured in an oxford mx100 dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 25 mk . </S>",
    "<S> for all top - gate voltages studied , the leakage current from top - gate electrode to the 2deg was less than 14 na , which is a negligible dc offset as compared to critical current values of the device .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 at @xmath4 = 0 v and @xmath10 = 0 v , before sweeping @xmath4 , is shown by the red curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 was found to be hysteretic in @xmath9 , with normal state resistance @xmath11 = 4 k@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we then swept @xmath4 from 0v @xmath13 + 40 v @xmath13 -40 v @xmath13 0 v , with @xmath10 = 0 v. as we swept to high negative values of @xmath4 , the @xmath8 increased drastically . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 characteristics after this @xmath4 sweep , at @xmath4 = 0 v and @xmath10 = 0 v were very different from those before the @xmath4 sweep , and are shown by the black curve in fig . 2a . </S>",
    "<S> we note four characteristic differences . </S>",
    "<S> first , @xmath11 increased to 11.8 k@xmath12 , which is much higher than its value before sweeping @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> second , there are two distinct current scales in the data after the @xmath4 sweep . </S>",
    "<S> one , which we denote by @xmath14 , is where the system transitions out of the zero resistance state , and the other , which we denote by @xmath15 , is beyond which the superconducting banks themselves go normal . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath14 as the current at which @xmath8 rises beyond 500 @xmath12 , and @xmath15 as the position of the most prominent peak in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> third , additional structure appears in @xmath8 , characteristic of the particular @xmath4 and reproducible in different @xmath9 sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 plot has negligible hysteresis near @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss each of these features in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> critical current measurements before sweeping @xmath4 showed that superconductivity for our sample is strongest at @xmath10 = 90 v. in order to ensure that the banks are strongly superconducting , we set @xmath10 = 90 v for all further measurements . </S>",
    "<S> transport characteristics of the device were found to be hysteretic in @xmath4 , hence all measurements were made going from positive to negative values of @xmath4 .        </S>",
    "<S> figure 2b shows how @xmath8 varies with @xmath9 for various values of @xmath4 , at @xmath6 = 30 mk . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that @xmath16 increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is a sum of the normal state resistance of the banks , which is independent of @xmath4 , and the normal state resistance of the top - gated part , which is a function of @xmath4 . before the @xmath4 sweep , at @xmath10 = 90 v , @xmath11 of the 600 @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> m long and 100 @xmath3 m wide section of the hall bar was 3 k@xmath12 , which gives a sheet resistance of the banks , @xmath17 , of 500 @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the top - gated section can be considered to be a parallel combination of the resistances of the two broader top - gated parts ( 20 @xmath3 m long and 40 @xmath3 m wide ) , which correspond to 0.5 squares each , and the narrowest top - gated part , which corresponds to 0.03 squares . </S>",
    "<S> knowing @xmath17 at @xmath10 = 90 v and assuming that the sheet resistance is uniform throughout the top - gated part , the normal state sheet resistance @xmath18 of the top - gated part can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 increases from 220 k@xmath12 to 430 k@xmath12 in going from @xmath4 = 30 v to -40 v. these values of @xmath18 are two orders of magnitude greater than the maximum values obtained by back - gating @xcite , which demonstrates the efficiency of the top - gate .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the structure in @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 and the origin of the two current scales , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> since we back - gated our sample at 90 v to be maximally superconducting , and from the fact that the strength of superconductivity is a non - monotonic function of gate voltage @xcite , we know that the top - gated region can not be a stronger superconductor than the banks , which means it is either a normal metal , an insulator , or a weaker superconductor . for values of @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> at which the top - gated part is a normal metal or an insulator , the narrowest 180 nm wide section of the top - gated region is the least resistance path for the current for all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this is also true for values of @xmath4 at which the top - gated region is a weaker superconductor than the banks , for the temperature regime below the critical temperature of the banks but above the critical temperature of the top - gated region .    in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting correlations of the banks can not be supported over the width of the broad top - gated part ( 20 microns ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 180 nm wide section of the top - gated region , however , may support superconductivity across its width , hence the supercurrent is    r0.48     confined to flow only through this section . </S>",
    "<S> this then defines a jj between the non - top - gated superconducting banks . </S>",
    "<S> the zero resistance state would disappear when @xmath9 exceeds the critical current of this narrow section , which corresponds to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath9 exceeds the critical current of the superconducting banks , the final high - bias resistance , which we call @xmath11 , is reached . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b , we see that the @xmath15 peaks for various @xmath4 fall on top of each other , supporting the claim that they are related to the superconducting banks themselves going normal . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 values on the other hand vary strongly with @xmath4 . the electric field due to the top - gate extends over some region beyond the top - gate electrode . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the peaks in @xmath8 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 appear as different parts of this region attain their critical currents . </S>",
    "<S> hence these features are characteristic of the specific value of @xmath4 .    for values of @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> at which the top - gated region is a weaker superconductor than the banks , for the temperature regime below the critical temperature of the top - gated region , however , the entire 100 @xmath3 m cross - section of the hall bar is superconducting . in this regime , we do not have current concentration through the narrowest section of the top - gated region , and hence no junction behavior . from our data , although we can not be sure about which regime we are in for a given value of @xmath4 , it is clear that at least for some values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , we have a weak link which is tunable by the top - gate .    in order to categorize our weak link , we measured @xmath8 as a function of @xmath9 at different temperatures for various @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a shows the variation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath6 for five different values of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the two data sets is distinctly different , as the variation of @xmath15 with @xmath6 seems to be almost independent of @xmath4 , while the @xmath14 vs. @xmath6 plots are very different for different @xmath4 . for long junctions </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath14 should decay exponentially with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> no exponential decay of @xmath14 is evident from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b , at least for the @xmath4 tested , and hence we conjecture that we are in the short junction limit , although we can not be sure what type of barrier separates the banks .    </S>",
    "<S> near @xmath19 , the current - phase relation of jjs becomes approximately sinusoidal @xcite , and hence the junction dynamics can be described by the well known tilted washboard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> jjs can be classified as either underdamped or overdamped based on junction dynamics , irrespective of the kind of barrier between the banks . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20 characteristics of our device are not hysteretic , and hence suggest an overdamped junction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we attempted to fit the zero bias resistance , @xmath21 , to the ambegaokar - halperin thermally activated phase slip model for overdamped jjs @xcite . according to this model , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the josephson coupling energy . </S>",
    "<S> the proportionality holds if @xmath24 . in our device , the estimated @xmath23s from the fits are about an order of magnitude larger than @xmath25 , ranging from 1.4 ev for @xmath4 = -15 v to 3.98 ev for @xmath4 = 10 v. the linear fits of ln@xmath26 vs. @xmath27 are shown for various @xmath4 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b . from the slopes of the linear fits we extract @xmath23 , which are plotted as a function of @xmath4 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c , again showing a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath4 . on the same plot </S>",
    "<S> we also show @xmath23 obtained from the measured @xmath14 , as calculated from @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that they too show the expected non - monotonic dependence on @xmath4 , although the @xmath23 values obtained in this way are larger than those obtained from the fits . </S>",
    "<S> we can not rule out the possibility that some parts of the broader top - gated sections could also contribute to transport , leading to inaccuracy in the measured @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fact that the transport parameters vary systematically with @xmath4 , suggests that @xmath4 provides a very good handle on the weak link properties .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated top - gate tunable weak links in the lao - sto system . </S>",
    "<S> the weak links fit reasonably well to an overdamped junction model . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the superconducting order parameter is a nonmonotonic function of the top - gate voltage , whereas the normal state resistance is a monotonic function of the top gate voltage , similar to what has been reported for back - gate tuning . in order to better characterize the junctions </S>",
    "<S> , we need to measure devices with blanket top gates , enabling us to have better control over device design and hence a better understanding of the system .    the u.s . </S>",
