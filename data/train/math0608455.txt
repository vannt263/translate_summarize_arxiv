    "in 1958 , m. nagata @xcite constructed a remarkable example of a compact complex threefold , which was the first example of a non - projective complete algebraic variety .",
    "a new aspect of this threefold was given by a. fujiki @xcite , who showed that nagata s example is a compactification of the twistor space of the famous eguchi - hanson metric on the cotangent bundle of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "fujiki proved this result by investigating the calabi family naturally associated to a hyper - khler metric .",
    "the most important geometric object in a twistor space is the twistor lines .",
    "since nagata s example is obtained from a product @xmath1 by applying a simple birational transformation , it seems natural to ask which curves in @xmath1 are transformed into twistor lines in nagata s example . in this note",
    "we give an answer to this question by describing all of them explicitly .    after recalling nagata s construction ,",
    "we first determine which curves in @xmath1 can be transformed into real lines in the nagata threefold ( propositions [ prop - type ] and [ prop - explicit ] ) . here ,",
    "a smooth rational curve in a threefold is called a real line if the normal bundle of the curve is isomorphic to @xmath2 and it is invariant under an anti - holomorphic involution of the threefold .",
    "these are candidates of twistor lines .",
    "the parameter space of these candidates consists of two connected 4-manifolds , which will be denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "there is a natural isomorphism between @xmath3 and @xmath4 which comes from an involution of @xmath1 of the same degree .",
    "although @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameterize real curves in @xmath1 , both contain 2-dimensional submanifolds parameterizing reducible curves .",
    "we find that , as a consequence of nagata s birational transformation , this situation is resolved for precisely one of @xmath3 and @xmath4 so that all its curves become irreducible .",
    "then by using our explicit description of the candidates , we show that the resolved family actually becomes the set of twistor lines ( theorem [ thm - main ] ) .",
    "all irreducible curves of the other family are also transformed into real lines in the nagata threefold .",
    "but the family can not be the set of twistor lines since the reducible curves ( parameterized by the 2-dimensional submanifold mentioned above ) remain reducible in nagata threefold ( even after applying the birational transformation ) .",
    "we observe that all these reducible curves contain a common curve ( which will be written by @xmath5 ) which is homologous to zero .",
    "we will also find that any members of this family can be deformed into a twistor line ( keeping the reality and smoothness ) if one allows the members to pass the situation that they have @xmath6 as their normal bundles in the nagata threefold .",
    "in particular , all irreducible curves in the other family are homologous to actual twistor lines .",
    "finally , we mention that in the paper @xcite n.j .",
    "hitchin gave an explicit description of the twistor spaces of multi - eguchi - hanson metrics ( i.e. gibbons - hawking metrics ) and their twistor lines .",
    "for the twistor spaces of multi - eguchi - hanson metrics , explicit birational transformation into a rational variety of a simple form seems unknown , except for the original eguchi - hanson metric , which is adapted in this papar .",
    "also , in the paper @xcite , d. burns explicitly constructed the twistor spaces of the contangent bundles of hermitian symmetric spaces and their twistor lines .",
    "the author does not know how to identify these works with the explicit description in this paper .",
    "* acknowledgment * the author would like to thank the referee for careful reading and invaluable comments .",
    "also he would like to thank shihoko ishii for answering his question on a hilbert scheme .",
    "first of all , we recall the construction of nagata threefold @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath7 for the complex projective line throughout this paper .",
    "let @xmath8 be the product of three complex projective lines , and write @xmath9 for the last factor which plays a special role .",
    "let @xmath10 be the projection , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 two distinct points of @xmath13 .",
    "we fix an isomorphism between the first and the second factors of @xmath14 and let @xmath15 be the diagonal",
    ". put @xmath16 , a divisor on @xmath14 . for @xmath17 , we write @xmath18 for the diagonal of @xmath19",
    ". let @xmath20 be the blowing - up along @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 the strict transforms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . because @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 gives isomorphisms @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the normal bundles of @xmath33 and @xmath23 in @xmath34 respectively , are isomorphic to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the holomorphic line bundle on @xmath37 of bidegree @xmath38 . therefore @xmath39 can be blown - down to @xmath40 along each two projections , and the same thing holds for @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the projection to the _ first _ factor and @xmath42 the projection to the _ second _ factor .",
    "let @xmath43 be the blowing down of @xmath34 inducing @xmath44 and @xmath45 on @xmath33 and @xmath23 respectively . if we interchange the role of the two factors , we obtain another threefold @xmath46 .",
    "in this way we obtain two smooth threefolds @xmath47 and @xmath46 . both @xmath47 and @xmath46",
    "are called _",
    "nagata threefolds_. the isomorphism of @xmath14 interchanging the first and the second factors naturally induces a biholomorphic map @xmath48 and hence these are naturally biholomorphic .",
    "we denote by @xmath49 for the projection naturally induced from @xmath10 .",
    "this is a holomorphic submersion .",
    "the fibers @xmath50 and @xmath51 are isomorphic to @xmath52 and all the other fibers are isomorphic to @xmath53 . if we denote @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the minimal section of @xmath58 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the effective curve @xmath59 is homologous to zero and hence @xmath47 does not admit a khler metric . finally , we define a divisors @xmath60 in @xmath47 as the bimeromorphic image of @xmath16 into @xmath47 .",
    "similarly @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are defined for @xmath46 .",
    "we have @xmath64 .",
    "next we introduce real structures .",
    "let @xmath65 be an anti - podal map of @xmath40 , which is an anti - holomorphic involution without fixed points .",
    "@xmath65 can be explicitly given by @xmath66 using homogeneous coordinates .",
    "then we define an anti - holomorphic involution @xmath67 on @xmath14 by @xmath68 here we are using the identification of the first and the second factors .",
    "clearly @xmath67 has no fixed points .",
    "further @xmath67 survives under the above construction and induces real structures on the nagata threefolds .",
    "we denote these real structures by @xmath69 on @xmath47 and @xmath70 on @xmath46 respectively .",
    "then @xmath71 are invariant under @xmath72 ; namely they are real .",
    "moreover , it is immediate to see @xmath73 and hence @xmath74 and @xmath75 are isomorphic as complex manifolds with real structures .",
    "so in the sequel we mainly consider @xmath74 ; corresponding results for @xmath75 are immediately obtained by using the isomorphism @xmath76 .",
    "we are going to show that @xmath77 is the twistor space of a hyperkhler metric on the total space of the cotangent bundle of @xmath78 , mainly by showing that the complex threefold @xmath79 is actually foliated by real lines .",
    "as a first step , we show the following proposition describing the images of real lines in @xmath47 ( if any ) under the above birational correspondence between @xmath47 and @xmath80 . to indicate curves in @xmath14 , we use the following notation : by taking three factors of @xmath14 as generators , we have a natural isomorphism @xmath81 , and the homology class of an effective curve on @xmath14 is determined by @xmath82 ; in other words , @xmath83 is the intersection number of the curve with fibers of the @xmath76-th projection from @xmath14 to @xmath78 .",
    "we call @xmath84 _ the degree _ of a curve for simplicity . on the other hand , a _",
    "real line _ in a threefold ( with real structure ) means a smooth rational curve which is invariant under the real structure and which has @xmath85 as the normal bundle .",
    "[ prop - type ] let @xmath74 be the nagata threefold equipped with the real structure given above , and suppose that @xmath87 is a real line in @xmath47 which is disjoint from the divisor @xmath60",
    ". then @xmath87 must be a section of @xmath88 .",
    "further by the birational correspondence between @xmath47 and @xmath80 , @xmath87 is transformed into a real curve in @xmath14 satisfying the following .",
    "( i ) if @xmath87 does not go through @xmath56 , then the degree of the corresponding curve in @xmath14 is @xmath89 and it goes through @xmath90 ( and hence @xmath91 also ) .",

    "first we show that @xmath87 is a section of @xmath94 . by standard calculations",
    ", we can show that the anti - canonical line bundle of @xmath47 satisfies @xmath95 on the other hand , by adjunction formula , we have @xmath96 .",
    "hence since we have assumed that @xmath87 is disjoint from @xmath60 , we have @xmath97 and thus @xmath87 is a section of @xmath94 .",
    "next to prove ( i ) suppose that @xmath87 is a real line in @xmath47 that is disjoint from @xmath98 ( and @xmath99 , and let @xmath43 and @xmath20 be as in the construction of @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath87 is a section of @xmath94 .",
    "obviously @xmath100 does not change a neighborhood of @xmath87 in @xmath101 and therefore @xmath87 still intersects @xmath33 and @xmath23 once respectively in @xmath34 . hence under the blowing - down @xmath20 the image of the real line goes through @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "next under the same assumption we show that the degree of the image of @xmath87 in @xmath14 is @xmath89 . because the image remains to be a section of @xmath10 , the degree must be of the form @xmath104 for non - negative integers @xmath105 and @xmath106 . moreover ,",
    "since the birational transformations keep the reality of @xmath87 , and since the real structure on @xmath14 interchanges the first and second factors as in ( [ eqn - rs ] ) , we have @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , the degree of the normal bundle must increase by two under the blowing - down @xmath20 .",
    "therefore it becomes @xmath108 .",

    "hence the degree of the normal bundle in @xmath34 becomes @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , this time , the blowing down @xmath20 makes no effect in a neighborhood of the curve . hence the degree of the normal bundle of the image of @xmath87 in @xmath14 must be zero .",
    "this happens only when the degree is @xmath93 and we obtain ( ii ) of the proposition . @xmath112    the real curves in ( i ) and ( ii ) of proposition [ prop - type ] can be easily written down explicitly .",

    "thus the point @xmath246 is represented by a vector @xmath247 it is easy to see that a map from @xmath248 to @xmath172 defined by @xmath249 has the following properties : it contracts @xmath250 to the origin , and maps each connected component of @xmath251 diffeomorphically onto @xmath248 . by ( [ eqn-2:1 ] )",
    "it follows that if we fix @xmath116 and allow the parameter @xmath144 to move in the domain @xmath160 , then the intersection point with @xmath235 takes each point of the fiber of @xmath252 over @xmath253 precisely once , except the two points corresponding to the two vectors represented by @xmath254 and @xmath255 in the above coordinate . the point corresponding to @xmath255 ( which is represented by a trivial section of @xmath10 ) is then passed by the transformation of a curve of ( c1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the point corresponding to @xmath254 ( which is represented by a vector tangent to @xmath256 ) is contained in @xmath60 .",
    "so the point does not need to be passed .",
    "it remains to show that the fiber of @xmath252 ( outside @xmath60 ) over @xmath257 is passed by some @xmath258 for a unique @xmath144 with @xmath160 .",
    "but this can be also verified by easier calculation using ( [ eqn-111 ] ) instead of ( [ eqn-111 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , all points of @xmath259 are also passed by a unique member of @xmath219 , since @xmath260 and all members of @xmath219 are real .",
    "thus we have shown that @xmath261 is foliated by members of @xmath219 , proving the assertion ( a ) .",
    "next we show the assertion ( b ) .",
    "since @xmath49 is a holomorphic submersion , there is an exact sequence @xmath262 it follows that @xmath263 , and equivalently , @xmath264 . on the other hand , by ( [ eqn - can ] ) , we have @xmath265 . from these",
    "we obtain @xmath266 . from this",
    "we conclude @xmath267 is trivial over @xmath60 .",
    "thus we have shown ( b ) .",
    "\\(c ) is obvious since we have just seen that any point of @xmath268 is passed by a unique member of @xmath219 and since @xmath268 is isomorphic to the total space of @xmath269 .",
    "this finishes a proof of theorem [ thm - main ] .",
    "@xmath112    as in @xmath47 , there are two families of real curves in @xmath46 whose parameter spaces are @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if we again write them by @xmath219 and @xmath220 respectively , the complement @xmath270 has a structure of the twistor space of a hyperkhler metric having @xmath220 as the set of twistor lines .",
    "of course this is isomorphic to the hyperkhler metric obtained in theorem [ thm - main ] .",
    "finally we give some remarks on the automorphism group of nagata threefold and its induced action on the 4-manifold @xmath271 .",
    "the identity component of the holomorphic automorphism group aut@xmath272 of @xmath86 is of course the product of three copies of the lie group @xmath273 .",
    "an automorphism @xmath274 aut@xmath272 ( @xmath275 ) induces that on the nagata threefold iff @xmath276 preseves @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( which are the center of the blowing - up @xmath277 ) .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the conditions @xmath278 and @xmath279 , where @xmath248 is the subgroup consisting of automorphisms which fix @xmath11 and @xmath280 .",
    "conversely , if an automorphism @xmath281 of the nagata threefold belongs to an identity component of the holomorphic automorphism group , @xmath281 preserves the center of the blowing - down @xmath282 .",
    "hence @xmath281 always induces an automorphism on @xmath14 , which necessarily belongs to the identity component .",
    "these mean that the identity component of the holomorphic automorphism group of the nagata threefold is the subgroup @xmath283 of aut@xmath272 given by the injection @xmath284 .",
    "further , an automorphism @xmath285 ( @xmath286 and @xmath279 ) commutes with the real structure @xmath67 ( defined by ) iff @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "this means that the identity component of the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the nagata threefold commuting with the real structure is exactly @xmath289 .",
    "since the action of @xmath289 preserves @xmath290 and commutes with the real structure , it naturally operates on the 4-manifold @xmath165 . if @xmath287 is represented by the matrix @xmath291 satisfying @xmath292 , then @xmath293 maps the curve @xmath141 ( defined by the equation ) to the curve @xmath294 where @xmath295 and @xmath296 satisfy @xmath297 this shows that the @xmath289-action on @xmath165 preserves the decomposition @xmath271 obtained in .",
    "also it follows from that the @xmath289-action on the @xmath298-bundle @xmath163 ( over @xmath78 ) is transitive and its isotropy subgroup at the point @xmath299 is @xmath300 .",
    "thus @xmath163 is diffeomorphic to @xmath301 .",
    "further , the @xmath298-bundle map @xmath302 ( assigning @xmath200 ) is exactly obtained from the hopf fibration @xmath303 by dividing each fiber by multiplying @xmath304 .",
    "this means that @xmath163 is identified with the unit circle bundle of the line bundle @xmath305 .",
    "therefore , the disk bundles @xmath306 and @xmath307 ( also assigning @xmath200 ) are identified with a disk bundle of @xmath308 ."
