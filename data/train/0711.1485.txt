    "recently the belle collaboration has reported a new state z(4430 ) in the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum in @xmath3 with statistical significance greater than @xmath4@xcite . the breit wigner fit for this resonance yields the peak mass @xmath5 and the width @xmath6 .",
    "the product branching fraction is determined to be @xmath7 .",
    "differing from other hidden charmonium - like states such as x(3872 ) and y(4260 ) etc , z(4430 ) is a positively charged state , therefore it must not be a conventional @xmath8 state .",
    "it would be an exotic state beyond the naive quenched quark model , if it is confirmed by the further experiments .",
    "some theoretical studies have been carried out to understand the structure and properties of this interesting state . because its mass is so close to the threshold of @xmath9 , rosner suggested that z(4430 ) is a s - wave threshold effect@xcite .",
    "meng and chao proposed that z(4430 ) is a s - wave @xmath10(or @xmath11 ) resonance , re - scattering mechanism has been suggested to explain the absence of the signal in @xmath12 for properly chosen parameters@xcite .",
    "the mass of z(4430 ) as a @xmath13 @xmath10 molecule was calculated from the qcd sum rule@xcite . a dynamical study of whether z(4430 )",
    "could be a s - wave molecular state of @xmath10(or @xmath11 ) has been performed@xcite , where the authors assumed that the long distance one pion exchange dominates .",
    "they found that the attraction from the one pion exchange potential alone is not strong enough to form a bound @xmath10(or @xmath11 ) molecular state .",
    "short range force maybe plays an important role in the dynamics of z(4430 ) .",
    "maiani et al suggested that z(4430 ) is a diquark - antidiquark state with flavor @xmath14[\\overline{c}\\overline{d}]}$ ] , it is the radial excitations of @xmath15 with mass about 3880 mev , which mainly decays into @xmath16 and @xmath17@xcite .",
    "tetraquark interpretation is also suggested based on the qcd - string model@xcite .",
    "other theoretical interpretations such as baryonium@xcite and threshold cusp effect are put forward@xcite .",
    "the mass and the production of the bottom analog of z(4430 ) have been studied as well@xcite .    just as x(3872 ) may be a weakly bound state of @xmath18@xcite , the closeness of z(4430 ) to the @xmath19 threshold strongly suggests that z(4430 ) could be a weakly bound @xmath19 molecular state .",
    "this is a old and very interesting idea which has been applied to a variety of mesons with unusual characteristics such as the @xmath20@xcite and @xmath21@xcite .",
    "although the mass of z(4430 ) is also close to the threshold of @xmath22 , @xmath23 is very broad , therefore it decays so quickly that it is nt possible to form a @xmath24 molecular state .",
    "the component of @xmath25(or @xmath26 ) could be neglected in the molecular state interpretation for z(4430 ) .",
    "if z(4430 ) is a weakly bound molecular state , it plays the role of deuteron in the meson antimeson interactions , which is sometimes called deuson@xcite .",
    "so we can apply the methods developed for the description of deuteron to z(4430)@xcite .",
    "we will use an effective field theory to describe z(4430 ) , which is similar to the pionless effective theory of shallow nuclear bound state@xcite .",
    "since the binding energy of z(4430 ) is small , the size of this bound state is quite large .",
    "consequently the particular details of the interactions between the heavy mesons and antimesons are irrelevant to the description of the molecule state , and we can use the effective lagrangian with four - meson interactions consistent with both the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry to study this system .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the crucial signals which can distinguish between the molecule and tetraquark interpretation in sec.ii . in sec.iii",
    "we construct the effective lagrangian consistent with heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry , the binding of z(4430 ) is studied by considering the transition amplitude for @xmath27 . taking into account the scaling of the effective coupling constant ,",
    "we predict the mass of the bottom analog of z(4430 ) .",
    "a summary of our results is given in sec .",
    "since the s - wave inter - hadron forces are strongest , it is natural to expect that @xmath28 is in relative s - wave , then the quantum number @xmath29 of z(4430 ) can be @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for the @xmath32 assignment , its production in @xmath33",
    "is strongly suppressed by the small phase space .",
    "the @xmath31 state has a larger mass and @xmath30 state should be more stable as suggested by the authors in@xcite .",
    "so we assume @xmath34 as a @xmath10 molecule with @xmath13 in this work .",
    "since z(4430 ) was reconstructed in the @xmath2 final state , from isospin and @xmath35-parity conservation , we learn z(4430 ) is a isovector state with positive @xmath35-parity . under @xmath36parity transformation ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 , therefore the flavor wavefunction of z(4430 ) is @xmath39    in @xcite , maiani et al .",
    "predicted two @xmath40 states , and their masses are approximately 3754 mev and 3882 mev respectively .",
    "they identified z(4430 ) with the first radial excitation of the higher @xmath40 state , then the radial excitation of the lower @xmath40 state with mass about 4344 mev should be observed in the @xmath41 final state as well .",
    "searching this state at belle or babar is an important test of the structure of z(4430 ) .",
    "the difference between the molecular state and the tetraquark interpretation is obvious . in the tetraquark picture , @xmath29 of z(4430 )",
    "is @xmath42 which is different from @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 in the s - wave @xmath10 molecular state case . for the molecule interpretation ,",
    "the leading source of decay is dissociation , to good approximation dissociation will proceed via the free space decay of the constituent mesons .",
    "since @xmath43 dominantly decays into @xmath44 , @xmath45 should be the main decay mode for z(4430 ) as a @xmath10 molecule .",
    "while the decay of z(4430 ) could proceed through the `` fall apart '' decay mechanism in the tetraquark picture , it can decay into @xmath18 and @xmath46 in both s - wave and d - wave besides the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 final states , however , it can not decay into @xmath51 due to its unnatural spin - parity .",
    "so whether the three body mode @xmath45 has considerable branch ratios or the two body decay modes @xmath18 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath52 is another important test of the nature of z(4430 ) .",
