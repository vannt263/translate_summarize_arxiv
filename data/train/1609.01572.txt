    "social dynamics is being studied qualitatively and quantitatively , extensively at present  @xcite .",
    "this interdisciplinary area used to be the traditional ground for social scientists , but has seen increasing participation of statistical physicists recently .",
    "social systems are quite interesting ",
    "they demonstrate rich emergent phenomena , resulting out of interaction of a large number of entities or agents  @xcite .",
    "these rich dynamical systems can be studied using various tools of statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "our present study concerns the dynamics of opinions , and how consensus may or may not emerge out of interacting individual opinions , or , to be rather specific , out of interaction of individuals whose opinions evolve out of influence of others .",
    "there has been a series of studies on this topic  @xcite , which have enriched our understanding in this regard .",
    "opinions are usually modeled as discrete or continuous variables , which can undergo changes spontaneously or due to interaction with others , or even external factors .",
    "the interest lies in the study of dynamics of opinions , as well as the steady state properties  a phase with a spectrum of opinions and another phase where the majority have similar values . in continuous opinion models , opinions cluster around a single value ( consensus ) , or two ( polarization ) or can even have several values ( fragmentation ) .",
    "the present model is similar to some simple models proposed recently  @xcite , apparently inspired by the kinetic models of wealth exchange  @xcite .",
    "a symmetry breaking transition was observed in such models : the average opinion is nonzero in the symmetry broken phase , while the opinions of all individuals are identically zero indicating a ` neutral state ' in the symmetric phase .",
    "the parameters representing _ conviction _ ( self interaction ) and _ influence _ ( mutual interaction ) in these models were considered either to be uniform ( scalar ) or in the generalized case different for each individual , i.e , as components of a vector .",
    "there is an added feature of the randomness in the influence term which effectively controlled the sharpness of the phase transitions in these models .",
    "the model we study has conviction parameter set to unity . in absence of interaction ,",
    "opinions here remain frozen , while any interaction , however small , leads to a state of all individuals having extreme opinions  @xcite .",
    "allowing for negative values in interaction ( influence ) takes care of the situation where a pair has a disagreement . this model  @xcite uses the fraction of negative influences as the tuning parameter to study the phase transition behavior .",
    "the salient features of the phase transition in the mean field / infinite range version fo the model is already known , including the universality class .",
    "there have been a few studies  @xcite extending this model to further realistic situations , by introduction of additional parameters .",
    "although the mean field behavior of the model has been well investigated , the knowledge of the critical behavior of the model in finite dimensions can only ascertain its universality class , which remains to be investigated . in this paper , we study the model in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions using extensive numerical simulations .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we introduce the model in sec .",

    ". in a system of @xmath5 individuals ( referred to as the ` society ' hereafter ) , opinions change out of pair - wise interactions via mutual influences / couplings @xmath6 as : @xmath7 one considers a similar equation for @xmath8 .",
    "the choice of pairs @xmath9 is unrestricted , and hence the model is originally defined on a fully connected graph , or in other words , of infinite range ( mean field ) .",

    "if the opinion value of an agent becomes higher ( lower ) than @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , then it is made equal to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) to preserve this bound .",
    "this bound , along with eq .",

    "is measured by the quantity @xmath18 , the average opinion , which is the order parameter for the system .",
    "changing the fraction of negative opinions @xmath19 one can observe a symmetry breaking transition between an ordered and a disordered phases  below a certain value @xmath20 of the parameter @xmath19 , the system orders ( giving a non zero , finite value of the order parameter @xmath21 ) , while a disordered phase exists above @xmath20 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "for the discrete @xmath14 case , it was shown following analytical calculations that the critical point is @xmath23 and @xmath24 , while monte carlo simulations confirmed the results , additionally finding @xmath25 and @xmath26 . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are scaling exponents for order parameter and susceptibility respectively . thus @xmath29 , if the upper critical dimension is taken as @xmath30 . however , for the continuous @xmath14 case , monte carlo simulations gave @xmath31 , while the critical exponents were same as in the discrete case .",
