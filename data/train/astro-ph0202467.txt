    "h  @xmath1  regions or molecular clouds are examples of zero - age objects which are young relative to the age of the galaxy . therefore these abundance ratios chronicle the results of billions of years of galactic chemical evolution . observations of isotopic ratios in stars and planetary nebulae ( pne ) measure locally how stars influence chemical evolution .",

    ".    measurements of 3  in the galaxy have led to what has been called `` the 3  problem '' @xcite .",

    "observations of 3  in protosolar material @xcite , the local interstellar medium @xcite , and galactic h  @xmath1  regions @xcite all indicate a 3  abundance ratio of @xmath13 @xmath17 . although h  @xmath1regions are expected to be zero - age objects there is no evidence for any stellar 3  enrichment during the last 4.5@xmath18@xcite .",
    "the observed abundances of 3  throughout the galaxy when combined with the observations that some stars do indeed produce 3  strongly disagree with standard chemical evolution models @xcite .",
    "anomalies in the @xmath0  abundance ratio in red giant stars has stimulated studies of non - standard stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "all of these models include some form of extra mixing which transports material in the convective envelope to lower regions which are hot enough for further nuclear processing and then transports it back up into the convective envelope .",
    "the extra processing that occurs is called cool bottom processing ( cbp ) .    during the first dredge - up on the red giant branch ( rgb )",
    ", the convective envelope reaches regions where 12  had previously been processed into 13  and @xmath19n ; thus we expect @xmath0  to decrease from @xmath13 90 to 25 for both low - mass and intermediate - mass stars @xcite .",
    "observations of carbon in the surfaces of red giant stars reveal lower @xmath0  ratios ( 520 ) for stars below 2@xmath3than theoretically expected ( e.g. , gilroy 1989 ) .",
    "studies which measure the evolution of the surface @xmath0  as a star ascends the rgb in m67 @xcite and in field stars @xcite indicate that additional processing occurs between the base and tip of the rgb .",
    "this has been attributed to extra mixing below the convective envelope .    during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb )",
    "the theoretical abundances depend on the interplay between dredge - up events , mass loss , hot bottom burning , and non - standard mixing ( cbp ) . during the third dredge - up on",

    "more massive than @xmath20@xmath3 , hot bottom burning drives the @xmath0  towards its equilibrium value of 3.5 @xcite .",
    "observations of abundances in pne measure the cumulative effects of different mixing and nuclear processing events during the entire evolution of their progenitors . in general the abundance of 3should follow the @xmath0  ratio ; that is , if 3  is destroyed then the @xmath0  ratio should decrease .",
    "therefore given the current observational challenges of detecting 3  in pne , an alternative approach is to measure @xmath0 .",
    "there have been several studies of @xmath0  in the molecular gas in pne using millimeter transitions of co @xcite . in these studies",

    "the progenitor masses , @xmath24 , are taken from pbstg for objects in common or determined by first using the central star masses determined by @xcite or stasiska , grny , & tylenda ( 1997 ) and the initial - final mass relation of @xcite .",
    "the pne morphology is defined as round ( r ) , elliptical ( e ) , or bipolar ( b ) @xcite .",

    "observations of the 12  and 13 ( j=2@xmath41 ) rotational transitions were made with the national radio astronomy observatory 12@xmath25  telescope on 1997 may and 1997 december .",

    "both the filter - bank and hybrid spectrometers were used simultaneously and were configured to provide spectral resolutions of 1@xmath27  and 2@xmath27  per channel which produce a velocity resolution of 1.4@xmath28  and 2.7@xmath28  per channel , respectively .",
    "the spectra were obtained by beam switching plus position switching ( bsp ) .",
    "the reference position ( off ) was typically 4 arcmin from the source position ( on ) .",
    "the pointing should be accurate to within @xmath29 arcsec .",
    "the data were calibrated on - line to the radiation temperature ( t@xmath30 ) scale which corrects for atmospheric attenuation , radiative loss , and rearward and forward scattering and spillover @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report all intensities in units of the main beam brightness temperature , t@xmath31 , using an efficiency of @xmath32 which converts the radiation temperature to the main beam brightness temperature ( mangum 1999 ) .",
    "observations of the 12  and 13  ( j=3@xmath42 ) transitions were made with the henrich hertz telescope ( hht ) during february 1998 and may 1998 .",
    "the facility 345@xmath26dual - polarization sis receiver was employed , although because of technical difficulties only one channel was used .",

    "the spectra have been shifted in velocity to align the profiles relative to the lsr velocity in table 1 . for several sources",
    "there is evidence for complicated velocity structure ( e.g. multiple peaks , asymmetries , etc . ) . in these cases",
    "this structure is being averaged over the telescope s beam and thus our analysis refers to the bulk properties of the molecular emitting gas .    for pne observed at both transitions we measure the j=3@xmath42 transition to be significantly more intense than the j=2@xmath41 transition .",
    "this effect is expected based on solely the radiative transfer in gas with physical conditions characteristic of pne .    in figure 2 ,",
    "the radiation temperature is plotted versus the upper j level rotational transition for co over a range of densities . across a broad range of physical conditions ,",
    "the j=3@xmath42 transition produces the brightest intensity ; only in the lowest volume density - column density models is the j=2@xmath41 intensity higher .",
    "the generally better coupling between smaller beams ( obtained at higher frequencies ) and pn structure also suggests that co searches in pne may be better carried out in the sub - millimeter regime ; atmospheric and hardware limitations may mitigate this effect .",
    "the derived @xmath0  ratios for our pn sample are listed in table 4 . in columns 3 and 4 the @xmath0  ratios",
    "are shown for the j=2@xmath41 and j=3@xmath42 transitions , respectively .",
    "values based on the integrated intensities are expected to be more accurate , but values based on the peak intensities are also given ( in parentheses ) .",
    "the @xmath5  abundance ratios are believed to be a direct measure of the @xmath0  ratio ; therefore we have assumed that @xmath0  = @xmath5 .",
    "chemical fractionation will lower the observed @xmath5  ratios , but this effect should be reduced by the observed high temperatures in the molecular gas ( @xmath41 k , bachiller et al .",
    "selective photo - dissociation of 13  causes an increase in the @xmath5  ratio but this will be counterbalanced by the charge exchange reaction @xmath42c@xmath43 + @xmath44co @xmath4 @xmath44c@xmath43 + @xmath42co @xcite .",
    "the range of @xmath0  ratios are lower than the values predicted by standard stellar models .",
    "about half of the objects observed in this study were also included in the sample of pbstg . in most cases",
    "our ratios agree with the pbstg values shown in the last column in table 4 .",
    "the peak main brightness temperatures for our observations are lower in all cases , as expected for the larger beam in our study .",
    "however the intensity is not proportional to the beam areas .",
    "these @xmath0  ratios were calculated under the assumptions that the filling fraction for the gas is the same for both isotopomers , both rotational transitions are thermalized to the same temperature , and that the emission lines are optically thin .",
    "the first assumption seems reasonable based on the spectra shown in figure 1 .",
    "a comparison of the different transitions reveals nearly identical @xmath45 and line shape characteristics , indicating that similar volumes of gas are sampled by the two transitions .",
    "the excitation characteristics of the low - j transitions of co also supports the assumption of a thermalized , uniform temperature .",
    "the small dipole moment of co results in a low critical density for rotational excitation ; thus most pne have densities high enough for significant co excitation .",
    "the effect of line opacity in co may be accounted for in multi - transition models of radiation transport .",
    "in order to better interpret our results , the radiative transfer in the pne is examined through the use of the sobelev or large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation @xcite .",
    "this model provides a numerical solution to the coupled equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium for the rotational transitions of co ( see e.g. leung & liszt 1976 ) .",
    "in particular , we used the rad package which is a part of the miriad software package @xcite .",
    "only the four pne for which we have measured multiple transitions of 12  and 13  emission are considered . for each source a two - dimensional grid composed of volume density ( @xmath46 ) and column density ( @xmath47 ) , over a range of physical conditions relevant to molecular gas in pne , is generated .",
    "we adopt a kinetic temperature @xmath48 k. this value is towards the high end of temperatures suggested by @xcite ; however , the higher j transitions of co typically trace warmer regions and the lvg grids are consistent with @xmath48 k. data taken with the hht ( j=3@xmath42 ) have been spatially smoothed to match the resolution of the 12@xmath25  ( j=2@xmath41 ) data .",
    "we assume that the emission fills the beam for both pairs of transitions , or has a similar beam filling fraction .",
    "we obtained @xmath49 values from a comparison of the data to the model grids as a measure of the quality of the fits .",
    "the derived @xmath0  ratios are listed in column 5 of table 4 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties were determined by propagating the measured error in the integrated intensities from table 3 .",
    "these statistical uncertainties may be much smaller than the systematic uncertainties .",
    "for the pne for which there only exists j=2@xmath41 detections the integrated intensity ratios are adopted .",
    "where the line shape is parabolic the line is optically thick so the @xmath0  ratios are cited as lower limits . for pne where we have detected both the j=2@xmath41 and j=3@xmath42 transitions an lvg analysis is performed and a @xmath0  ratio determined . below",
    "we discuss each of these sources in more detail .",
    "_ afgl 618_using 13  we derive @xmath46 = @xmath50@xmath51and @xmath47 = @xmath52@xmath53 . using these values , we obtain @xmath47 = @xmath54@xmath53  for 12 , yielding a ratio of @xmath5  @xmath29 .",
    "overall this value is consistent with the observations .",
    "this model overproduces the j=2@xmath41 emission by about 20% and the best fit density to the j=2@xmath41 is a factor of @xmath132 lower than that derived from the 13 .",
    "this may suggest that the observed @xmath5  ratio is a lower limit , since the 12  and 13  emission regions are not identical , or that density , temperature , and abundance gradients exist which are not isolated in velocity space .",
    "although the derived opacity in the j=3@xmath42 and j=2@xmath41 lines from the lvg grids is low , the line shape is strongly suggestive of high opacity .",

    "although this value is very low , the model suggests that the opacity remains low for both transitions ( e.g. , @xmath56 for 12 ) .",

    "moreover , the values obtained from the ratios of the integrated intensities and peak intensities are not consistent , most likely due to the low signal - to - noise ratio in the 13data . due to these concerns , we adopt @xmath5  = 32 as a lower limit .    _",

    "in addition , the derived physical characteristics for 13  were highly inconsistent with those from 12 .",
    "since ngc7293 is an evolved pn , the simplest explanation for these results is that structure in the co line emitting gas couples differently in the two beams , so the j=2@xmath41 and j=3@xmath42 regions are distinct and different .",

    "the high @xmath0  values are expected from third dredge - up of 12 , while depending on the mass of the star the very low @xmath0  ratios could be explained by hot bottom burning or by deep mixing .",

    "there have been heated discussions about the analysis of spectra using the iso - intensity method @xcite .",

    "these uncertainties can be as large as 50% ( e.g , galli et al .",
    "1997 ; pbstg ) .",
    "therefore care must be used when interpreting these results .",
    "the error bars in figure 3 for @xmath0  ratios are based on the uncertainties in the measured integrated intensity for each transition .",
    "note that the systematic errors may be much larger than these , in some cases .",
    "our results are consistent with pbstg with the exception of ngc6720 where our @xmath0  ratio is a factor of two smaller . however , the signal - to - noise ratio for the 13  j=2@xmath41 transition is only 5 and we do not have multiple transitions for this pn . therefore the 12  transition may be optically thick and our @xmath0  value a lower limit .",

    "the @xmath0  ratios range between 2.231 with progenitor masses from @xmath63@xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that at least some stars do undergo some non - standard processing such as cool bottom processing ( cbp ) . because of the large uncertainties in determining the progenitor mass it is difficult to make any strong statements about the relationship of @xmath0  with @xmath62 .",
    "since cbp is expected to operate only for stars with @xmath64@xmath3  the @xmath0  ratios should be larger for stars above this mass . above 4@xmath3",
    "hot bottom burning can drive the @xmath0  ratio towards it equilibrium value of 3.5 @xcite .",
    "the low @xmath0  values between 24@xmath3  might indicate further processing on the agb or that we have underestimated the @xmath0  ratios .",

    "bipolar pne tend to lie closer to the galactic plane with a wider distribution of central star masses and have higher n / o ratios @xcite    since most of the pne in our sample have only been detected in one transition we do not have sufficient constraints to determine the co line opacity . if the 12  line is optically thick then the @xmath0values will be underestimated and the points in figure 3 must be increased .",
    "clearly more @xmath0  ratios are required to improve the statistics , together with multiple co transitions to constrain radiative transfer models .",
    "because of the higher kinetic temperatures in pne , observations in the sub - mm regime may be more useful for this purpose .    a significant effort has been made to detect co toward the six pne in which 3  have been measured to directly establish the relationship between non - standard mixing in low - mass stars and the 3  and @xmath0abundances ( pbstg ) .",
    "the stellar models predict that non - standard mixing ( cbp ) will lower both 3  and @xmath0 . based on chemical evolution models more than 90% of low - mass stars",

    "only one object with a measured 3  ratio , ngc6720 , has been detected in co. since the measured 3  upper limit of 3  = @xmath65 is consistent with both the standard model and with models which include cbp , the current data do not provide any interesting constraints . note that the progenitor mass of ngc6720 is slightly above 2@xmath3  which is where cbp should turn off .",
    "co is typically detected in young pne where the nebula has not evolved sufficiently to dissociate the molecular material .",
    "in contrast , 3  is best detected in evolved , older pne which tend to fill the telescope s beam .",
    "therefore it is not a coincidence that there is little overlap between the two samples . as pointed out by pbstg",
    ", observations using the ciii ] transition toward pne will have a better opportunity to match the 3  samples .",
    "currently , the number of pne with either ciii ] or 3  detections is sparse .",
    "the green bank telescope will offer a significant improvement in our ability to detect 3  in pne and thus increase the current sample of one well determined ratio ( ngc3242 ) and two probable detections .",
    "observations of co in pne will complement any ciii ] data . because of the large uncertainties in estimating the progenitor masses we feel that the number of detections must be significantly increased to build a strong observational case for non - standard mixing in pne .",
    "it is interesting to note that even if cbp occurs in most low - mass stars it will not be a significant factor in the chemical evolution of @xmath0 in the galaxy since the production of carbon is dominated by intermediate - mass stars ( pbstg ) .",
    "therefore , measurements of 3  is one of the few methods to probe how low - mass stars influence the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
