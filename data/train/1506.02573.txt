    ".      we can now numerically approximate solutions to using the standard north - west corner approximation of the matrices @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath82 we let @xmath83 denote the @xmath84 matrix defined as @xmath85 for each @xmath67 we find @xmath86 eigenvalues for @xmath83 which approximate the eigenvalues of @xmath87 , whose spectrum consists only of the point spectrum as stated in theorem [ teo - gi ] . in figure [ fig - eig ]",
    "we have plotted the eigenvalues of @xmath83 for @xmath88 as functions of @xmath67 .",
    "first of all we notice that for all @xmath89 we find @xmath90 as leading eigenvalue .",
    "this is expected since by theorem [ teo - gi](i ) for all @xmath89 the operator @xmath20 admits an eigenfunction @xmath91 with eigenvalue @xmath92 , which corresponds to the invariant measure for the map @xmath14 .",
    "second we conclude from the results that the approximation of the eigenvalues of @xmath93 gets worse and worse as @xmath89 approaches 1 . this is evident in the leading eigenvalue , which is a curve very close to 1 , but slightly decreasing as @xmath19 , and is probably the reason for the other curves to be non - increasing as @xmath89 approaches 1 .",
    "then we can ask how good is the approximation given by the eigenvalues in figure [ fig - eig ] . to quantify the goodness of the approximation we can use the only analytical result about the spectrum of @xmath93 , namely the computation of its trace given in theorem [ teo - gi](iv ) .",
    "we have plotted in figure [ convergence](a ) the function given in theorem [ teo - gi](iv ) , which is the upper most curve diverging as @xmath19 , and the traces of the matrices @xmath83 as functions of @xmath67 for different values of @xmath86 . in particular",
    "we have chosen @xmath94 .",
    "we see that as @xmath86 increases we get a better and better approximation of the trace of @xmath93 , and the two almost coincide for @xmath95 .",
    "however as @xmath89 approaches 1 , we see that the approximation of the trace becomes poor , and in particular for @xmath96 , the small oscillations in the curve show numerical instabilities in the computations .",
    "hence we believe that the computation of the eigenvalues of @xmath83 in figure [ fig - eig ] is a very good approximation of the eigenvalues of @xmath93 for @xmath95 .",
    "for example for @xmath97 , the eigenvalues of @xmath98 are the set @xmath99 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.7 ) ) , and these values coincide for what we find in figure [ fig - eig ] .",
    "it is instead unclear what happens as @xmath89 approaches 1 .    to try to understand this point we have plotted in figure [ convergence](b ) the eigenvalues of figure [ fig - eig ] together with the sums of the eigenvalues of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath100 find in theorem [ teo - gi](iii ) , that is the curves @xmath101 which coincide with the first five eigenvalues of @xmath93 for @xmath97 .",
    "the behavior of the trace of @xmath83 with respect to that of @xmath93 , and figure [ convergence](b ) suggest that all the eigenvalues of @xmath93 converge to 1 as @xmath19 , so that for @xmath102 the spectrum of @xmath93 would consist of the eigenvalues 0 and 1 and of the purely continuous spectrum @xmath103 .",
