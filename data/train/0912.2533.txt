    "the neutron - proton interaction in the spin - one channel is attractive and stronger than the identical - nucleon interaction . nevertheless , the nuclei observed in nature favor identical - particle pairing . a trivial answer to this puzzle",
    "is that most nuclei have different numbers of protons and neutrons , and the isospin polarization discourages pairing in the isospin - zero ( t=0 ) channel .",
    "but even in nuclei with equal numbers of neutron and protons the @xmath2 neutron - proton pairing does not compete well with ordinary @xmath3 pairing , as evidenced by the ground - state spins and binding systematics of odd - odd nuclei@xcite .",
    "this puzzle presents a serious challenge to nuclear theory that must be resolved if the theory is to be used confidently in contexts where experimental information is not available , such as astrophysical environments .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the explanation of the suppressed spin - triplet pairing is the presence of the strong nuclear spin - orbit field @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit field interferes with the pairing in both channels , but it suppresses it more strongly in the @xmath4 neutron - proton channel than in the @xmath5 identical - particle channel . since the spin - orbit splitting is a surface effect , one might expect that the pairing would change character to the @xmath4 condensate in extremely large nuclei . in the limit of large nuclear size , the surface - to - volume ratio would be small and the spin - orbit field would be ineffective at controlling the single - particle spectrum . in this paper",
    "we apply the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory with a simplified hamiltonian to examine the properties of the pairing condensate as one approach this limit .",
    "we shall find that the transition to @xmath4 pairing does occur in large nuclei , but is only strong for nuclei that are somewhat beyond the limit of stability with respect to proton emission .",
    "to keep the calculations as simple as possible , we consider a hamiltonian consisting of a phenomenological single - particle hamiltonian together with a two - particle interaction , h = _",

    "we use parameter values @xmath9 mev , @xmath10 fm which are close to standard values in the literature  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  2.181 ) .",
    "we do not expect that the competition between the different kinds of pairing will depend sensitively on @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the spin - orbit strength parameter @xmath13 will be important in the competition , and its determination requires some discussion .",
    "unfortunately , first - principles studies of the nuclear hamiltonian are not at a point where quantitatively reliable spin - orbit fields can be calculated  @xcite .",
    "however , given the woods - saxon form in eq .",
    "( [ vso ] ) , one can constrain the parameter quite well from spectroscopic data .",
    "a good source is the energies of single - particle excitations in nuclei adjacent to closed shells . for the present study we fit the experimental spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the nucleus@xmath16ca  @xcite .",
    "the measured value is 7.0 mev , and the fitted spin - orbit strength is @xmath17 mev-@xmath18 .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of not more than 10% in this value , based on comparison with other ways to estimate it .    we only treat nuclei with equal numbers of neutrons and protons in this work , enforcing the condition by taking equal chemical potential in the hfb equations .",
    "the value of the chemical potential is fixed by demanding that the density goes to the standard value @xmath19 @xmath20 in the nuclear - matter limit . with the chosen single - particle hamiltonian ,",
    "the corresponding chemical potential is @xmath21 mev .",
    "note that our hamiltonian neglects the coulomb interaction .",
    "this allows us to approach the nuclear matter limit but the calculated nuclei extend to the unphysical region beyond the proton dripline .",
    "the two - particle matrix elements are determined by a contact interaction of the general form [ v ] ij | v | kl = ^6_v_ij|^(3)(r - r)p_l=0 p_| kl . here",
    "@xmath22 is a projection operator on total orbital angular momentum zero .",
    "the @xmath23 is a projection operator on the six spin - isospin channels @xmath24 .",
    "the interaction strengths @xmath25 are of course independent of the @xmath26-projections of spin and isospin , and we shall call the two independent strengths @xmath27 and @xmath28 for spin - singlet and spin - triplet , respectively . however , we will need to keep explicit the six amplitudes with different @xmath26-projections when constructing the hfb condensate .",
    "it should also be noted that the contact interaction has to be regulated in some way to produce a finite condensate . this will be implemented by including only orbitals whose orbital single - particle energies @xmath29",
    "are within a range @xmath30 of the fermi energy , @xmath31 .",
    "our choices for the parameters will be guided by the relevant shell model matrix elements of phenomenological shell - model hamiltonians . in this way",
    "we hope to avoid some of the ambiguity associated with the form of the pairing interaction ( see concluding section ) .",
    "specifically , we take the usdb hamiltonian fitted to @xmath32-shell nuclei @xcite and the gx1a hamiltonian fitted to @xmath33 shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "we consider all the shell - model matrix elements with total spin and isospin couplings @xmath34 , and make a least - squares fits to each set using the contact interaction and harmonic oscillator orbitals . in the fit",
    ", we give equal weight to all matrix elements in the @xmath35-scheme representation .",
    "the results for the ratio of interactions strengths @xmath36 , shown in table i , are in the range 1.6 - 1.7 .",
    "another fitted hamiltonian to @xmath33-shell spectra @xcite gives a very similar ratio ( 1.56 ) . to get the absolute values of the strengths , we also need to specify the oscillator parameter controlling the size of the orbitals",
    "this is taken as @xmath37 mev and 11 mev for the @xmath32-shell fit and the @xmath33-shell fit respectively .",
    "the deduced strength parameters @xmath38 are also given in the table .",
    "one sees that the interactions derived from usdb and gx1a are in good accord with each other .",
    "unaccountably , the interaction from ref .",
    "@xcite has much lower strengths .",
    "for application to the hfb theory outside given shell - model spaces , it is still necessary to choose a suitable space cutoff parameter @xmath39 .",
    "an argument can be made identifying @xmath39 with the harmonic oscillator shell energy @xmath40 , which would put it in the range of @xmath41 mev.for the strengths in table i. for our study here , we have somewhat arbitrarily taken the strength of the spin - singlet and spin - triplet interactions to be @xmath42 mev-@xmath43 and @xmath44 mev-@xmath43 , respectively , with a cutoff of @xmath45 mev .",
    "the ratio is 1.5 , giving the spin - triplet somewhat less of an enhancement than the fits suggests .",

    "i>j _ ij ij | v | ij_i,j where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the ordinary and anomalous densities associated with the transformation .",
    "there is also a @xmath49 term in the interaction energy which we ignore along with all other hartree - fock contributions .",
    "another convenient quantity for studying the pairing phases is the condensation energy , also called the correlation energy @xmath50 .",
    "this is defined as [ ecorr ] e_corr = e_0 -e .",
    "where @xmath51 is the energy of the ground state in the absence of a pairing condensate , the hfb ground state will maximize the correlation energy . by the bloch - messiah theorem @xcite , the solution of the hfb equations",
    "could also be found by the bcs minimization with the variational wave function @xmath52 , provided one knows the orbitals @xmath53 and the pair correspondence @xmath54 .",
    "for ordinary spin - zero pairing in nuclei with even numbers of nucleons , we know that the pairs are the partner orbitals under the time - reversal operator .",
    "if the orbital basis does not have more than one orbital of given orbital angular momentum @xmath55 , the partners are related by the time - reversal operator , @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "thus , for narrow energy - band windows @xmath39 and not too large nuclei , the bcs theory is adequate",
    ". this will provide one check on the more complicated hfb calculations .    for spin - triplet pairing in the presence of a spin - orbit field ,",
    "the hfb treatment is unavoidable because the optimum orbital basis @xmath58 depends on the relative strengths of the pairing and spin - orbit fields .",
    "however , there is one case where the bcs treatment is valid .",
    "that is for a single @xmath59-shell and pairing in the @xmath60 channel . in that case",
    "the pairing field demands that @xmath61 ) .",
    "this is uniquely satisfied by the same partnering as in the @xmath62 pairing channel .",
    "we shall also use this case for testing the full hfb code .",
    "another important physical quantity is the quasiparticle energy @xmath63 , defined as the eigenvalue of the hfb matrix equation , eq .",
    "( [ hfb ] ) .",
    "it has the interpretation as the removal or addition energy for a particle in system with an even number of nucleons .      before presenting calculations with physical values of the hamiltonian parameters ,",
    "we examine the theory in the limit of @xmath64 symmetry .",
    "the symmetry requires that the two pairing strengths be equal and that the potential be purely central .",
    "the hfb ground state of this hamiltonian is highly degenerate , with many distinct ways to form the pairs .",
    "for example , one solution of the hfb equations is the state having both nn and pp pairing , with independent condensates for both .",
    "but we can equally well form a condensate pairing up - spin neutrons with up - spin protons and another condensate pairing the down - spin nucleons with each other . both states have the same energy in the @xmath64 limit .",
    "this will be shown explicitly the example presented in sect .",
    "more generally , there is a continuous group of transformations that leaves the condensation energy invariant .",
    "the degeneracy of the hfb ground state can only be broken by treatments of the wave function beyond the hfb approximation , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we set up hfb equations in a basis of states @xmath65 constructed from the eigenvectors of the central hamiltonian @xmath66 .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry and represent the orbital wave functions by their quantum numbers @xmath67 and radial wave functions @xmath68 on a uniform radial mesh .",
    "the basis is truncated by keeping only states whose single - particle energies @xmath29 ( without spin - orbit ) are within a range @xmath69 of the fermi energy , @xmath70 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is treated by including its orbital interaction matrix elements in the hfb hamiltonian .    to efficiently calculate the pairing field elements @xmath71 in the hfb matrix ,",
    "we save and store the anomalous densities @xmath72 on a radial grid .",
    "the densities @xmath47 and @xmath48 are calculated in the orbital representation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , eq . ( 7.23 ) ) from the selected columns of the transformation matrix that diagonalizes the hfb hamiltonian . under the assumption of spherical spatial symmetry ,",
    "the hfb matrix is block - diagonal with respect to the orbital quantum number @xmath55 ; the different @xmath55-blocks are calculated separately in our codes .",
    "if one restricts the anomalous density to channels having @xmath60 , the matrix can further be decomposed into blocks of fixed @xmath73 .",
    "further details are given in appendix a.",
    "before applying the theory to very large nuclei , we investigated its performance in an experimentally well - studied region , namely the mass region corresponding to an open @xmath14 shell .",
    "the middle nucleus filling the @xmath14 shell is @xmath74cr , with 4 neutrons and 4 protons outside the completely filled shells of @xmath75 , and @xmath76 orbitals . to model this nucleus , we take the radius parameter @xmath77 fm corresponding to the phenomenological the single - particle hamiltonian gives a spectrum that corresponds very well with the shell assignments with the @xmath14 shell at the fermi energy .",
    "the hfb equations are solved adjusting the chemical potential to get the correct particle number , @xmath78 .",
    "some results for the hfb theory are presented in table ii , showing how the gaps and correlation energies depend on the hamiltonian properties .",
    "we first demonstrate the degeneracy of hfb solutions when the hamiltonian has @xmath64 symmetry in the spin and isospin degrees of freedom .",
    "the required hamiltonian has spin - field field set to zero and equal pairing strengths @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the calculated properties of the condensate are shown in the first four rows of table ii .",
    "one sees that the calculated quasiparicle energy is independent of the quantum numbers of the condensate and is the same for all orbitals .",
    "the correlation energy is also independent of the choice of condensate , demonstrating the degeneracy of the @xmath64 hfb ground state .",
    "going now to a more realistic hamiltonian , rows 5 and 6 in the table show the maximum effect of the spin - orbit field , taking only the @xmath14 shell for the single - particle space .",
    "row 5 shows the results for an ordinary spin - singlet condensate , pairing neutrons with neutrons and protons with protons .",
    "the quasiparticle energy @xmath63 is the same for all 8 orbitals in the shell .",
    "the value , @xmath79 mev , is in fact close to the average experimental odd - even mass difference .",
    "row 7 shows the results for spin - triplet pairing .",
    "the @xmath80 condensates define a direction in space and the gaps are no longer independent of the @xmath81 quantum number of the orbitals .",
    "these gaps are plotted as a function of @xmath81 in fig . 1 .",
    "one sees that the gap approaches zero as @xmath81 becomes small .",
    "this behavior would be called gapless superfluidity in a large system .",
    "the correlation energies of spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairing can be compared in the last column of the table .",
    "one sees that it smaller for spin - triplet than for spin - singlet .",
    "thus , the ground state should exhibit ordinary pairing , as expected .",
    "we next augment the single - particle space by adding the @xmath15 shell , including the physical spin - orbit splitting .",
    "the results for four choices of condensate are presented .",
    "first of all , one sees that the correlation energies are larger than in the pure @xmath14 hamiltonian .",
    "they could not be smaller because the hfb theory is variational : enlargening the space can only lower the energy .",
    "the first two rows here show the results for spin - singlet pairing , differing on the isospin coupling .",
    "the energy are exactly the same due to the isospin invariance of the hamiltonian .",
    "a similar degeneracy is found for the spin - triplet pairing ; here the condensate energy does not depend on @xmath82 .",
    "we shall exploit this invariance later by limiting our trial condensates to be either @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath81 is conserved and the hfb matrix can be diagonalized in small blocks ( see appendix a ) . the final entry in the table is for the hamiltonian in the full @xmath33-shell .",
    "this is in fact the truncation that result from the @xmath45 mev cutoff around the fermi energy .",
    "we see that the correlation energies are larger , as expected .",
    "the spin - singlet pairing is still the stronger one , so the hamiltonian with the @xmath39 passes the test of agreeing with known phenomenology .",

    "we showed in the previous section that the correlation energy does not depend on the @xmath92components of the spin or isospin of the condensate , so we may limit our exploration of possible condensates to the @xmath60 channels .",
    "as mentioned above , the hfb matrix reduces to blocks of fixed @xmath93 for these channels .",
    "we find the self - consistent solutions of the hfb equations iterating from a starting point in which there is a finite condensate in some channel .",
    "for the range of nuclear sizes that we consider , the pairing gap is comparable to or smaller than the energy spacing of the shell orbitals . under these conditions",
    "the strength of the pairing condensate will be quite sensitive to the fermi level .",
    "since we are interested here in nuclei that have well - formed pairing condensates , we shall only calculate systems where the chemical potential ( @xmath94 mev ) coincides with the orbital energy of some @xmath59-shell .",

    "the calculated correlation energy for this nucleus is 1.4 mev , which is not large enough to be considered a strong condensate .",
    "nevertheless , the observed ground state spin and parity ( @xmath103 ) agrees with the quantum numbers of the spin - triplet condensate .",
    "the middle nucleus , @xmath101sr has a somewhat smaller condensation energy , @xmath104 mev , so any effects of the pairing would be quite weaker .",
    "the nuclei in this mass region are accessible with current - generation accelerators and their experimental spectroscopic properties are under active study .",
    "the third nucleus , @xmath102er , just beyond the physical region , is the smallest nucleus having both strong pairing ( @xmath105 mev ) and a spin - triplet condensate .",
    "there are two nearly degenerate shells at the fermi energy , the @xmath106 and @xmath107 shells .",
    "they both have radial nodes and weak spin - orbit splitting from their @xmath59-shell partners .",
    "a table of the correlation energies is given in appendix b. the table also shows the angular momentum quantum numbers at the fermi energy for each case calculated .",
    "this study offers a resolution of the conundrum , why is it that ordinary nuclei only exhibit spin - singlet pairing when nuclear matter calculations find that spin - triplet pairing is stronger ?",
    "the answer , that ordinary nuclei are too small to be out of the influence of the surface spin - orbit field , is seen by calculating the pairing energies over a large range of sizes . for our hamiltonian",
    ", the spin - triplet pairing dominates for all calculated nuclei whose radii are larger than @xmath108 fm , and for a number of lighter nuclei having low-@xmath109 shells at the fermi energy .",
    "the candidate for the smallest nuclei with a well - developed condensate , @xmath1 , is tantalizingly close to region of physical nuclei defined by the single - nucleon driplines .",
    "however , due to the simplifications made to the hamiltonian and to other uncertainties we can not be quantitative about the transition point . in particular , important physics",
    "may be lost in ignoring the momentum- and density - dependence of the pairing interaction . in the theory of nuclear matter",
    "the spin - singlet pairing derived from brueckner theory is very weak at nuclear matter density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "8)@xcite ; see also the contradicting claim in ref .",
    "@xcite . the pair gap becomes larger at subnuclear densities , suggesting that surface effects are crucial for that channel .",
    "in many studies of nuclear structure , the authors assume that there is some surface enhancement of the pairing , see e.g. @xcite . beyond the effects that are treated in the brueckner theory , there is likely to be a significant induced interaction associated with collective surface vibrations @xcite . if we included either mechanisms enhancing the surface region , the pairing energy would decrease as the nucleus becomes larger .",
    "this of course could effect the crossover from singlet to triplet condensates .",
    "also one needs to take into account renormalization effects associated with the truncation of the orbital space .",
    "one finds that the renormalized interaction is actually suppressed in the surface region @xcite .",
    "clearly , there is much left to do to improve the interaction .",
    "it would also be interesting to explore the effects of nuclear deformation . breaking the spherical symmetry",
    "would effectively reduce the single - particle level density at mid - shell filling , weakening the pairing condensates .",
    "how this affects the competition between the two kinds of pairing is not known .",
    "there are a number of other questions that could be addressed within the context of the simplified hamiltonian that we have employed .",
    "can two kinds of condensates coexist in the same system ? at first sight",
    "this seems unlikely because the bulk pair correlation length is large compare to the sizes of the nuclei we consider .",
    "however , it has been claimed that the cooper pairs have a small size in the nuclear surface@xcite .",
    "this might allow the existence of a mixed phase with a strong spin - triplet condensate in the interior and a spin - singlet condensate on the surface .",
    "another interesting question is the fragility of spin - triplet pairing is when there is a neutron excess . for our midmass triplet - pairing candidate nucleus , @xmath110",
    ", the condensate seems quite robust with a calculated correlation energy 6 mev larger than the singlet energy .",
    "it might be that the system could support a few excess neutrons and still preserve the triplet condensate .",
    "we have not addressed the question of how the triplet pairing condensate could be observed , beyond noting that the character of the condensate controls quantum numbers of the ground state in an odd - odd system .",
    "in fact several @xmath2 ground states are sprinkled among the 12 odd - odd @xmath111 nuclei known experimentally .",
