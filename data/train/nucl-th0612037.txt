    "the statistical model of nuclear disassembly in heavy ion collisions is quite successful .",
    "here one assumes that the disintegrating system with a given excitation energy expands to greater than normal volume before it breaks up into many composites of various sizes .",
    "interactions between different composites in the rarefied situation can be neglected and the break up can be calculated using the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "this basic assumption is implemented in different versions according to degrees of sophistication and detail .",
    "thus we have the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) of copenhagen @xcite , the microcanonical model of gross @xcite and randrup and koonin @xcite .",
    "an easily implementable canonical ensemble model was later introduced @xcite .",
    "the details of the model and many applications can be found in a recent publication @xcite .",
    "it has been customary to pay a great deal of attention to the production cross - sections of intermediate mass fragments and light charged particles .",
    "here we study the properties of the largest fragment that emerges in multifragmentation .",
    "these properties are not easy to study but the canonical model allows for such computation .",
    "as we will see , the heaviest fragment also reveals some interesting physics .",
    "data on the heaviest fragment and fragments with the maximum charge were published by eos collaboration @xcite . in these experiments",
    "one studied the disintegrations of projectile - like excited fragments in the reactions au+c ,",
    "la+c and kr+c .",
    "we do our calculations for au+c .",
    "calculations for the other two systems will be similar .    in section",
    "ii we write down the theoretical formulae needed for the calculations .",
    "results are presented in section iii .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "the formulae used in this calculation are provided here .",
    "simpler formulae for a hypothetical system of one kind of particles are given in @xcite .",
    "we will consider disassembly of the projectile - like fragment(plf ) where the plf is formed by the shearing off of a part of @xmath0au ( by the @xmath1c target ) .",
    "this plf will have a charge @xmath2 ( usually less than 79 ) and a neutron number @xmath3 ( usually less than 118 ) .",
    "this plf will break up into many composites with charges @xmath4 and neutron number @xmath5 ( for example , @xmath6be has @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "if the number of composite with proton and neutron numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively is @xmath9 then conservation of charge and baryon number dictates that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the canonical partition function for the system at a given temperature @xmath12 is given in our model by @xmath13 here the sum is over all possible channels of break - up ( the number of such channels is enormous ) which satisfies the conservation laws ; @xmath14 is the partition function of one composite with proton number @xmath4 and neutron number @xmath5 respectively and @xmath9 is the number of this composite in the given channel .",
    "this is a low - density/ high temperature approximation the justification of which is demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite . for a given channel the sum @xmath15 is called the multiplicity of the channel .",
    "the one - body partition function @xmath14 is a product of two parts : one arising from the translational motion of the composite and another from the intrinsic partition function of the composite : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the mass of the composite and @xmath18 is the volume available for translational motion ; @xmath18 will be less than @xmath19 , the volume to which the system has expanded at break up .",
    "we use @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the normal volume of the plf .",
    "we will shortly discuss the choice of @xmath22 used in this work .",
    "the probability of a given channel @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 the average number of composites with @xmath4 protons and @xmath5 neutrons is seen easily from the above equation to be @xmath25 the constraints @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be used to obtain different looking but equivalent recursion relations for partition functions .",
    "for example @xmath26 instead of labelling partition functions by their charge and neutron numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 we can for example label them by total mass ( @xmath27 ) and charge @xmath2 .",
    "labelling them by @xmath28 we have @xmath29 these recursion relations allow one to calculate @xmath30 ( equivalently @xmath31 ) very quickly in the computer .",
    "we list now the properties of the composites used in this work .",
    "the proton and the neutron are fundamental building blocks thus @xmath32 where 2 takes care of the spin degeneracy . for deuteron ,",
    "triton , @xmath33he and @xmath34he we use @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ground state energy of the composite and @xmath37 is the experimental spin degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "excited states for these very low mass nuclei are not included . for mass number @xmath38 and greater",
    "we use the liquid - drop formula . for nuclei in isolation , this reads ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derivation of this equation is given in several places @xcite so we will not repeat the arguments here .",
    "the expression includes the volume energy , the temperature dependent surface energy , the coulomb energy , the symmetry energy and contribution from excited states since the composites are at a non - zero temperature . for @xmath41 , ( the proton and the neutron number ) we include a ridge along the line of stability .",
    "we have used two sets to test the sensitivity of the results to the width of of the ridge .",
    "we call these set 1 and set 2 . in set 1 for each @xmath42 between 5 and 40 , 5 isotopes",
    "are included ( case for @xmath42=4 and lower was already mentioned before ) ; for @xmath43 , 7 isotopes are included for each @xmath42 . in set 2 , 5 isotopes are used for @xmath42 between 5 and 9 , 7 isotopes are used for @xmath42 between 10 and 40 and 9 isotopes for each @xmath43 .",
    "the results are quite similar in most cases except for one figure which we will point out when we compare with data .",
    "it should be pointed out that enlarging the width of the ridge does not necessarily imply a better calculation as one may begin to overcount the phase space .",
    "the coulomb interaction is long range .",
    "the coulomb interaction between different composites can be included in an approximation called the wigner - seitz approximation .",
    "we incorporate this following the scheme set up in @xcite .",
    "this requires adding in the argument of the exponential of eq.(7 ) a term @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 are the mass and charge number respectively of the disintegrating system , @xmath21 is the normal nuclear volume for this system and @xmath19 , the freeze - out volume ( typically 4 - 5 times @xmath21 ) . defining @xmath46 the energy of the system is given by @xmath47 where for @xmath48 we have @xmath49+s\\frac{(i - j)^2 } { a^2}-t[\\partial\\sigma(t)/\\partial t]a^{2/3}$ ] .",
    "for @xmath50 we use @xmath51 .",
    "we label as @xmath52 the excitation energy : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is calculated for mass number @xmath55 and charge @xmath56 using the liquid - drop formula .",
    "the central issue in this work is the calculation of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( and their fluctuations ) when the fragmenting system has charge @xmath56 and mass number @xmath55 .",
    "let us fix on calculating @xmath57 .",
    "the calculation for @xmath58 can be done by analogy with appropriate and obvious changes in the formulae .",
    "there is an enormous number of channels in eq.(1 ) .",
    "different channels will have different values of @xmath59 .",
    "for example there is a term @xmath60 in the sum of eq.(1 ) . in this channel @xmath59",
    "the probability of this channel occurring is ( from eq.(3 ) ) @xmath61 .",
    "the full partition function can be written as @xmath62 .",
    "if we construct a @xmath30 where we set all @xmath63 s except @xmath64 and @xmath65 to be zero then this @xmath66 and this has @xmath67 . consider now constructing a @xmath68 with only three @xmath63 s : @xmath69 .",
    "this will have @xmath59 sometimes 1 ( as @xmath70 is still there ) and sometimes 2 ( as , for example , in the term @xmath71 ) .",
    "we are now ready to write down a general formula .",
    "let us ask the question : what is the probability that a given value @xmath72 occurs as the maximum charge ? to obtain this we construct a @xmath30 where we set all values of @xmath73 when @xmath74 .",
    "call this @xmath75 . then @xmath76 ( where @xmath30 is the full partition function with all the @xmath63 s ) is the probability that the maximum charge is any value between 1 and @xmath72 .",
    "similarly we construct a @xmath77 where @xmath78 is set at zero whenever @xmath79 .",
    "the probability @xmath80 that @xmath72 is @xmath59 is given by @xmath81 the average value of @xmath59 at given temperature and for given @xmath82 is @xmath83 and the fluctuation is @xmath84 before we end this section we want to mention that the largest composite we obtain at the end of the above calculation is at a finite temperature @xmath12 and can further decay by evaporation , ending up in a lower mass or charge number . from our past experience",
    "@xcite we know what the effect will be : @xmath59 will decrease slightly but the effect on the @xmath85 will be significant . without the evaporation the calculated @xmath86 will be overestimated ( see fig.19 of @xcite ) .",
    "inclusion of evaporation as an after burner is not possible at this stage .",
    "the sum over @xmath72 ( eq.(9 ) ) is too huge and for each @xmath72 there is a sum over neutron number .",
    "we will hope to get @xmath59 nearly right but will overestimate the @xmath86 value .",
    "the next section compares data with our calculations .",
    "in the eos experiment part of the projectile ( au , la and kr ) is sheared off by the @xmath1c target .",
    "we will compare our calculations with the au+c data .",
    "the size of the excited plf which decays depends upon the impact parameter which also determines the amount of excitation energy per nucleon in the excited plf . in figs.1(b ) and 1(c ) of @xcite the size of the excited plf ( the size and charge are denoted by @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) is plotted as a function of excitation energy @xmath52 per nucleon .",
    "this aspect of the experiment depends upon dynamics and is outside the scope of a thermodynamic model .",
    "however , given @xmath52 and @xmath87 , this excited plf will expand and break up into many pieces and this is calculable in a canonical thermodynamic model . in our fig.1 ( data taken from fig.1(f ) of @xcite )",
    "we have plotted @xmath88 as a function of @xmath52 per nucleon where @xmath59 is the average maximum charge carried by a composite .",
    "the data are shown as points joined by a dotted curve .",
    "the other curves are exploratory calculations .",
    "our fit to experimental data is given in fig.2 .",
    "we now explain how the calculations are done .    for a given value of @xmath87",
    ", the experiment provides the value of @xmath52 .",
    "the beginning of a canonical thermodynanic model besides @xmath55 , @xmath56 , are a temperature and a freeze - out density @xmath89 ( freeze - out density in unit of normal nuclear density @xmath90= 0.16@xmath91 ) which will then provide all the observables including @xmath52 . for a fixed @xmath52 the canonical model employs a fixed @xmath89 .",
    "for example , for central collisions of sn on sn at 50 mev per nucleon beam energy , a freeze out density of one - sixth normal density gives good results for production cross - sections of intermediate mass fragments @xcite .",
    "however , in the eos experiment @xmath52 varies over a wide range ( from less than 2 mev per nucleon where the validity of the thermodynamic model as used here can be questioned to 10 mev per nucleon where the thermodynamic model is expected to work well ) and hence we should expect that @xmath89 will also need to vary in this interval . in general , the freeze - out density will decrease as @xmath92 ( @xmath93=multiplicity , @xmath55=mass number of the dissociating system ) increases , reaching some asymptotic value for large multiplicity . in smm",
    "@xcite the freeze - out density varies in each channel , decreasing as the multiplicity increases ( this makes monte - carlo simulation mandatory ) . in the canonical model , at a given temperature , the freeze - out density is kept fixed irrespective of channels . thus the freeze - out density can be dependent only on the average multiplicity .",
    "past comparisons with smm predictions showed that at least for the obsrvables studied so far this simplification is quite adequate @xcite .",
    "fig.1 compares the data if in the calculation the freeze - out volume is kept fixed at @xmath89 = 0.25 ( a typical canonical model value ) or at 0.39 ( this is an often quoted value in the model used in @xcite ) .",
    "the value 0.39 is clearly better at low values of @xmath52 but leaves too large a residue at higher @xmath52 whereas the value 0.25 is better at the higher end of @xmath52 but is an underestimation at the lower end of @xmath52 .",
    "the data undoubtedly point to the need of a variable @xmath89 if the whole spectrum of @xmath52 is to be covered . in fig.1 , for brevity we show results with set 1 only ( see previous section for the range of nuclei covered in set 1 ) .",
    "fig.2 compares data with our calculation where we use a variable @xmath89 .",
    "we have used a parametrisation @xmath94 where @xmath42=0.17 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 mev@xmath97 .",
    "no optimisation of the fit was tried but the values are suitable for the low and high limits of @xmath52 .",
    "our values of @xmath89 are also very similar to those quoted in table ii of @xcite where a different model was used .",
    "we have shown results with set 1 and set 2 ( this includes a larger number of composites than set 1 ; see previous section ) .    in the canonical model calculation",
    "normally the inputs are the freeze - out density and temperature . here",
    "we use the freeze - out density and @xmath52 .",
    "given this density and @xmath52 we find the temperature which would give back the @xmath52 we started with .",
    "we then calculate @xmath59 .",
    "calculations for @xmath98 were also done and the fits are similar .",
    "next we turn to results for @xmath99 and @xmath100 which are shown in fig.3 .",
    "data are from fig.2 of @xcite . here",
    "@xmath101 where @xmath102 is the @xmath103th moment of the fragment distribution : @xmath104 . the over - estimation in the calculation for @xmath86",
    "was already alluded to in the previous section .",
    "afterburner for the largest fragment will bring the distribution more closely packed near the line of maximum stability thus reducing the fluctuation .    the probability distribution ( eq.8 ) of @xmath59 as a function of @xmath59 for eos experiments is not known to us but in view of the recent interest in such distributions @xcite we have computed the distributions and displayed them in fig.4 .",
    "we find that there is a window where the distribution is bimodal .",
    "usually for discussion of bimodality one uses a fixed freeze - out volume and varies the temperature but here , as we discussed before , our freeze - out density actually changes as @xmath52 ( hence @xmath12 ) changes but the nature of bimodality is still clearly seen ( if we fix the freeze - out density the plots are very similar ) .",
    "probability distribution for @xmath98 ( calculated but not shown here ) also has the window for bimodality .",
    "connection between bimodality and first order phase transition in the canonical model ( which does have a first order phase transition ) is being pursued and we also hope to do calculations for other experimental data .",
    "the canonical thermodynamic model clearly reproduces many important features of the largest fragment resulting from multifragmentation .",
    "the model is very easy to implement and yet is very realistic .",
    "the same model gives remarkable fits to light charged particles , intermediate mass fragments and as we have just seen , the largest fragment as well .",
    "we have thus far reported the calculation of properties of the largest fragment without making any link with the subject of liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "we make a brief connection here . in a large system(see details in a recent article @xcite )",
    "composites with charge @xmath105 comprise the gas phase . at co - existence",
    ", there will be , in addition , one large composite which is the liquid .",
    "this picture gets blurred as the system size is reduced , but , nonetheless , the largest fragment ( at temperatures below that which displays bimodality ) is an approximate scaled down version of the liquid . in a finite system bimodality in the largest fragment distribution",
    "occurs in the temperature ( energy ) window where the system passes from the liquid - gas co - existence phase to the pure gas phase .",
    "the largest cluster has been discussed in the literature before @xcite .",
    "however these all use the lattice gas model or the ising model ( often with fixed magnetisation ) .",
