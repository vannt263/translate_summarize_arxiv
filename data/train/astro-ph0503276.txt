    "it is important to realize , however , that wmap does not measure curvature in any direct geometric way .",
    "constraints on curvature derive primarily from a measurement of the angular diameter distance to recombination , @xmath14 , which depends upon curvature but also upon @xmath15 and models for dark energy or other constituents of the universe .",
    "hence the curvature results are dependent upon the @xmath16cdm ( or other ) model for dark energy assumed in the analysis .",
    "our ignorance of the dark energy phenomenon limits our ability to test for flatness or to look for small finite @xmath7 that may be predicted in variants of inflation @xcite or in universes with non - trivial topology @xcite .    our ignorance of the true curvature will , conversely , foil attempts to characterize dark energy properties with type ia supernovae ( or other standard candles ) , which measure @xmath17 at lower redshifts .",

    "hence even with perfect knowledge of @xmath23 , there is always some dark energy behavior @xmath29 which reproduces that data for _ any _ choice of curvature .",
    "the degeneracy between curvature and dynamics is well known , _ e.g.  _",
    "@xcite demonstrates that even complete knowledge of @xmath23 can not constrain the curvature in the absence of a dynamical model for the expansion .",
    "constraints on curvature from @xmath30 data arise solely because of our preferences for forms of @xmath29 that arise from certain equations of state .",
    "allowing alterations to the friedmann equations adds additional degeneracy .",
    "we can break the degeneracy between curvature and @xmath29 without making dynamical assumptions if we apply the metric to some line segment that does not originate at @xmath31 , essentially forming a cosmological - scale triangle .",
    "for example if a gravitational lens at @xmath32 bends a light ray by angle @xmath33 , then the apparent deflection of a source at @xmath34 observed from @xmath31 obeys @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the proper angular - diameter distance at @xmath34 as viewed from @xmath32 .",

    "this @xmath7 dependence is well known , _ e.g.  _   equation  ( 13.70 ) in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ chords ] illustrates how the curvature of the universe is indeterminate when distances from @xmath31 are the only observables , whereas a measure of @xmath42 determines curvature .",
    "@xcite remarks that the presence of this differential distance in gravitational lensing equations could provide useful cosmological tests , but to our knowledge no practical implementation of this  or any other ",
    "metric curvature test has been proposed .",
    "we propose that @xmath7 be determined by measuring the gravitational lensing shear @xmath43 of background galaxies_i.e .",
    "_  the gradient of @xmath44 in and measuring the amplitude of the contribution from the @xmath45 term in .",
    "a foolishly optimistic estimate of the accuracy available on @xmath7 can be obtained by assuming that the deflection angles @xmath33 are known _ a priori _ at all redshifts and positions on the sky , and that the angular diameter distance @xmath41 has been measured as well .",
    "since @xmath46 and @xmath47 are in the range 0.51.5 at relevant distances for weak lensing in the @xmath16cdm fiducial model , the lensing shear scales as @xmath48 , so we would find that @xmath49 .",
    "the typical shear amplitude @xmath43 over a line of sight is @xmath50 at cosmological distances .",
    "the uncertainty in shear is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of galaxies with well - measured shapes .",
    "a space - based survey can measure 100 galaxies per square arcminute , which leads to @xmath53 , far better than the current model - dependent constraints .",
    "this estimate is unrealistic , however , because neither the distance functions nor the deflections will be known .",
    "below we will investigate a simultaneous solution for the angular - diameter distances , deflection strengths , and @xmath7 from cross - correlation of lensing shear with foreground galaxy distributions , and estimate the resultant degradation in the curvature constraint .",
    "if we execute the wl curvature measurement by dividing our galaxy sample into redshift bins , then we note that we do not actually need to know the redshift of each bin ; it is only the distance @xmath54 of each bin that enters into the calculation of the shear .",
    "hence biases in photometric redshifts do not affect the curvature measurement .",
    "it is essential , however , to insure that the galaxies in a bin are at a common distance .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we examine metric tests for curvature which might be possible with other cosmological observables besides weak lensing . in ",
    "2 we develop the methodology for using weak lensing cross - correlations to solve simultaneously for the curvature , distance relationships , and deflector properties .",
    "the implementation is significantly more involved and subtle than the simple idea that curvature is manifested in @xmath42 .",
    " 3 applies the formalism to forecast curvature constraints from feasible surveys , and extends the formalism to include treatment of the likely dominant systematic error . ",
    "4 investigates the constraints on parametric models of dark energy ( @xmath55,@xmath56 ) that can be derived with the curvature left free to vary , and compares the present results to some previous work on weak lensing cross - correlations .",
    " 5 summarizes and concludes .",
    "similarly metric determinations of @xmath7 are in principle derivable from other cosmological measurements .",
    "the most promising is the detection of the recombination acoustic horizon scale , which is known in comoving physical units from the cmb , in the power spectrum of galaxies , recently demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "the transverse baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) test measures the angular scale subtended by this standard ruler , and hence measures @xmath57 .",
    "the transverse bao method does not by itself break the curvature - dark energy degeneracy , but may serve as a source of high - reliability constraints on @xmath41 to combine with weak lensing information . again for a given galaxy subsample , the redshift itself is unimportant , just the observable @xmath54 .    with sufficient redshift resolution , the acoustic scale may be identified along the line of sight , yielding knowledge of @xmath58 hence the comparison of line - of - sight to transverse bao scales can yield @xmath7 directly , but requires one to either integrate the line - of - sight @xmath59 data or differentiate the transverse @xmath41 data .",
    "doing either operation in the presence of noise adds substantial difficulties to making a high - accuracy comparison , unless one assumes a parametric form for @xmath41 .",
    "counts of galaxy clusters are sensitive to @xmath60 .",
    "volume - element data alone can not measure @xmath7 , but could potentially do so in combination with high - precision measures of @xmath41 _ and _ its derivative .",
    "cluster counts are also , however , dependent upon the growth of structure , so do not offer the model - independent cosmographic information of weak lensing or baryon oscillations .",
    "stellar evolution has been proposed as a standard chronometer @xcite , which could determine @xmath59 and hence the curvature if combined with measures of @xmath54 . to contribute to the metric measurement of curvature ,",
    "accuracies of a few percent on @xmath59 are required , and further investigation into the complexities of stellar and galactic evolution are needed in order to determine whether robust constraints at this accuracy are possible .",
    "strong lensing may also be used to discern the behavior of @xmath61 , if one is presented with a lensing system with multiply - imaged sources at a variety of ( known ) background redshifts .",
    "such use of multiple arcs around clusters has been investigated in the context of constraining dark energy @xcite , and would be equally applicable to determination of curvature , but also equally susceptible to the small uncertainties in the mass profiles of clusters .",
    "the metric curvature determination is clearly an extension of the cross - correlation cosmography ( ccc ) technique proposed by @xcite : one identifies rich foreground clusters and measures the dependence of the induced background shear upon @xmath34 of the source galaxies .",
    "the mass of the cluster(s ) may be unknown , but the _ ratio _ of any two background shears is a purely cosmographic function . @xcite combine this approach with other dark energy probes .",
    "@xcite[bj04 ] generalize the method to a cross - correlation between foreground estimated - mass distributions and background shear patterns . in this case the cluster - mass uncertainty is replaced by an unknown bias factor for each foreground mass shell , over which we marginalize .",
    "@xcite[zhs ] give a more elegant analysis in which the galaxy - shear cross - correlations are considered simultaneously with the shear - shear correlations in a single fisher matrix .",
    "@xcite also include the galaxy - galaxy correlations in the same fisher matrix , and make use of a parametric model of bias based on the halo model of galaxy distributions .",
    "all of these analyses differ substantially in their analytic approaches , underlying assumptions , and estimated constraints .",
    "a full comparison is beyond the scope of this paper , but we will make some brief comments below . here",
    "we attempt to recast the problem in a manner suited to the metric curvature constraint , but also amenable to studying the parametric dark - energy constraints investigated by these authors .",
    "the shear induced in direction  on sources at @xmath34 by mass in the foreground can be decomposed into @xmath62- and @xmath63-mode components . in the weak - lensing limit ,",
    "the former is straightforwardly related to the lensing convergence @xmath64 and the latter should vanish . hence we will consider the shape information to come in the form of the convergence field @xmath64 , which depends upon direction and source redshift as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the overdensity @xmath67 of the total mass .",
    "we also idealize the sky as consisting of @xmath68 discrete pencil - beams of solid angle @xmath69 , with the true mass density @xmath70 being statistically independent of the density in any other beam .",
    "we can choose @xmath69 to correspond to a correlation length of the true continuum shear field .",
    "we will assume @xmath71 ; the results depend only weakly on this choice .",
    "we could equivalently decompose the shear and mass distributions into spherical harmonics , in which case our choice of @xmath69 becomes equivalent to a maximum multipole @xmath72 .",
    "the weak lensing equation ( [ kappa1 ] ) can be written @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the step function , and we have reparameterized the source- and lens - plane distances by @xmath75 , @xmath76 . this equation assumes the validity of general relativity in two respects : first , that light follows the geodesic equation for the metric , and second , that we have the usual poisson equation .",
    "the second assumption can be dropped in our quest for a purely metric test of curvature . in our formalism a change of the poisson equation would be accommodated by generalizing @xmath77 to mean the convergence caused by the mass at distance @xmath78 , even if this means that @xmath66 is no longer the unaltered mass distribution .",
    "we discretize the analysis by considering the galaxies to be located on a series of @xmath79 shells , in order to facilitate the construction of fisher matrices below .",
    "the finite thickness of the shells complicates the analysis ( zhs ) and in fact it is possible to draw erroneous conclusions from a discrete analysis , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "below we will attempt to return the discrete formulation to the continuum limit and discuss these issues .",
    "the measured shear at each source plane becomes , with a noise term now added , @xmath80 now @xmath81 is the mass overdensity averaged through the shell of width @xmath82 ; @xmath83 is a factor that converts this overdensity into the convergence measured on a lens plane at infinity .",
    "the shear measurement noise is determined by the areal density @xmath84 of shape - measurable galaxies on shell @xmath85 , and @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the true mass fluctuation @xmath81 is not directly observable .",
    "but we assume that we deduce from the galaxy distribution some estimate of the mass overdensity @xmath87 that is correlated with the true distribution .",
    "this proxy field need not be the galaxy density itself , but rather the result of any algorithm applied to the observed galaxy field , _ e.g.  _  involving the assignment of halos to galaxies , groups , and clusters .",
    "the correlation coefficient of the true and proxy mass fields is @xmath88 where the angle brackets denote averaging over direction .",
    "the @xmath89 are not known but are assumed positive .",
    "we assume that the shells are thick enough to be uncorrelated .",
    "we also define for each shell an unknown bias via @xmath90 note that this is the bias of the _ true _ mass with respect to the _ estimated _ mass .",
    "the more conventional bias @xmath91 of the estimated ( galaxy ) mass to the true mass is , for gaussian - distributed @xmath92 and @xmath66 , related to this via @xmath93 the shear noise @xmath94 is assumed to have correlations with neither the true nor the proxy mass distribution .",
    "with these definitions we could extract curvature information from our observed shear data as follows : we cross - correlate each convergence field @xmath95 with each foreground proxy field @xmath96 to give an observable quantity @xmath97 . from the expectation values",
    "are @xmath98 there are @xmath99 non - zero observable cross - correlations , which are statistically independent for any significant sky coverage .",
    "these @xmath97 are determined by the @xmath79 factors @xmath100 , plus the matrix @xmath101 that is defined by @xmath79 distances @xmath102 and the single @xmath7 .",
    "hence there are @xmath103 free parameters , so we might expect an unambiguous fit to the data for @xmath104 .",
    "after marginalization over the nuisance parameters @xmath105 and @xmath102 ( which carry much information about dark energy and galaxy formation ! ) one obtains constraints on @xmath7 .    unfortunately the simultaneous solution for @xmath7 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 from the system of equations ( [ expect ] ) has three degeneracies in the neighborhood of @xmath11 .",
    "the transformations @xmath108 each leave the observable shear unchanged to first order in @xmath7 and the free parameters @xmath109 .",
    "the first degeneracy is a simple scaling of the @xmath102 , which is unsurprising as the lensing observables depend only upon distance ratios .",
    "the second degeneracy is similarly benign as it leaves the solution for @xmath7 unchanged .",
    "but the third degeneracy leaves @xmath7 indeterminate .",
    "the degeneracy can be broken if we assume some functional form for @xmath41 , but our goal is a model - independent constraint .",
    "the same imaging survey that is used to generate the shear measurement and the foreground galaxy maps can be used to measure the transverse baryon acoustic horizon scale , if the photometric redshift accuracy @xmath10 is sufficiently good .",
    "this will produce a statistically independent measure of @xmath102 at each shell , which we may use to break the curvature degeneracy that remains in the lensing cross - correlations .",
    "there is a more subtle problem with a solution for cosmology via .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the solution offers no discriminatory power on cosmology if we allow the @xmath105 to be completely free , because the matrix @xmath110 must be invertible as we approach the continuum limit .",
    "looking explicitly at the continuum limit in , stebbins shows that there must always be some function @xmath111 such that @xmath112 in fact we can construct this function explicitly to first order in @xmath7 : @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the dirac function .",
    "surprisingly this inversion of the lensing cross - correlation is local .",
    "given this solution , we simply set @xmath115 and get an exact solution on this line of sight , regardless of our choice of @xmath7 and @xmath41 functions .",
    "there is hence no possibility of inference of cosmological parameters along this line of sight as we reach the continuum limit .",
    "similarly a solution of the cross - correlation is possible for any choice of cosmology , once we reach a large number of lens and source planes , as @xmath116 is always invertible to give a valid @xmath106 .",
    "an exit from this conundrum is the realization that giving complete freedom to the bias function @xmath117 is tantamount to discarding our initial presumption that the proxy field is correlated with the true mass distribution .",
    "imagine slicing the universe so finely as to assign each proton its own bias value with respect to the dark matter .",
    "with this freedom we could clearly produce any macroscopic mass distribution we wish , including one that has no correlation at all with the galaxy - scale baryon distribution .",
    "we must therefore incorporate into the analysis some criteria for the coherence of the bias parameter in order to reflect our underlying assumption that mass has some correlation with the proxy field .",
    "we note , for example , that the continuum - limit inversion formula will produce a divergent solution for @xmath118 in the presence of any finite amount of shot noise on the lensing field @xmath119 .",
    "the cross - correlation between estimated @xmath118 and @xmath120 can be estimated from the multiple lines of sight in the survey , and will be driven to zero in this continuum limit . if the likelihood function for our joint analysis of the @xmath64 and @xmath92 fields requires them to be correlated gaussian variables , then the rapidly varying components of the inversion solution for @xmath66 will be suppressed in a maximum - likelihood solution , and it becomes possible to discriminate cosmologies .",
    "we do not claim yet to have a rigorous model - independent method to approach the continuum limit .",
    "below we produce a likelihood function for the shear and proxy fields that incorporates their presumed correlation on scales of a shell thickness .",
    "our practical approach will be to see how the uncertainties in our cosmological parameters scale as the number of shells increases ; in fact we see no significant changes in any of the results below as we decrease the shell size as far as @xmath121 .",
    "another practical approach that we will take is to include a regularization condition on @xmath117 to lower the probability of solutions that vary rapidly on short redshift ( and hence time ) scales , in accordance with our physical intuition ; this too has no significant impact upon our forecasts .",
    "a potentially more enlightening approach to the cross - correlation problem may be to parameterize the functions @xmath41 and @xmath122 by expansions in orthonormal function sets , such as fourier modes or legendre polynomials , rather than assume a stepwise variation and/or discrete galaxy distributions .",
    "the accuracy of constraints on @xmath7 can be estimated by the fisher matrix methodology .",
    "we produce a fisher matrix for a single line of sight , and then multiply by @xmath68 since we have assumed all lines of sight to be independent . on each line of sight",
    "there are three @xmath79-dimensional vectors : the measured convergence ; the true mass distribution @xmath123 ; and the proxy mass estimate @xmath124 .",
    "we need a likelihood function @xmath125 , which we then must marginalize over the unobservable @xmath123 .",
    "this probability can be expressed as @xmath126 since the shear measurements arise from the sum of many individual galaxy shape measurements , the shear measurement noise is well expressed as a gaussian distribution , so the first term is @xmath127\\right\\}.\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the convergence noise matrix @xmath129 , and @xmath130 .    for analytical convenience",
    "we take the joint probability @xmath131 of the true and estimated masses to be a bivariate gaussian at each slice .",
    "this is undoubtedly a poor approximation , _ e.g.  _",
    "most of the lensing cross - correlation power is on angular scales where the mass distribution is highly non - linear and non - gaussian .",

    "we may derive a fisher matrix using the formulae for zero - mean distribution given , _",

    "we also multiply this by the number of independent lines of sight in the survey to get @xmath138,\\ ] ] with the commas in the subscripts denoting differentiation .",
    "the fisher information nicely separates into three parts : the first is the information that can be gleaned from the variances of the mass estimator @xmath92 , _",

    "the third term is fisher information that would arise from adjusting parameters to minimize the @xmath139 in the fit of @xmath64 to the estimated mass @xmath92 in , were the values of @xmath92 taken as fixed and the matrix @xmath137 taken as a known covariance for the @xmath64 values .",
    "the third term is information gleaned from the actual covariance of the @xmath64 residuals to this fit , and looks just like the fisher matrix for pure shear power - spectrum tomography , except that the relevant mass power spectrum in this term is @xmath134 , the power that is uncorrelated with the galaxies , not the ( larger ) total power of @xmath66 .",
    "hence the inclusion of cross - correlation will lower the sample variance in lensing power - spectrum tomography .    in this paper we will presume that none of the ( co-)variances of the true or estimated mass distributions are well predicted by theory .",

    "the number of redshift bins will range from 30 to @xmath169 to search for effects of the artificial discretization of the problem .      the fisher matrix for the fiducial cosmology yields , first , an estimate of the uncertainty on @xmath7 of @xmath170 in the unrealistic case where all the biases , distances , and correlation coefficients are known _ a priori_. this is in good agreement with our crude guess earlier .",
    "when we marginalize over all parameters except @xmath7 , we find that _ if we project out the degeneracy in equation ( [ degen3 ] ) _",
    ", then the weak lensing ccc method is remarkably efficient at extracting @xmath7 , giving an uncertainty @xmath171 , nearly as good as before any marginalization .",
    "of course this is akin to stating that the titanic was watertight , aside from the big gash from the iceberg .",
    "nonetheless this feature of the ccc method is illuminating : it tells us that the role of other distance measures , _",
    "i.e.  _  supernovae and transverse bao , will be purely to bound the size of the quadratic degeneracy in the ccc distances that couples to @xmath7 , because the ccc method reduces any _ other _ form of uncertainty in @xmath41 and @xmath7 to far below the level achievable from such experiments .",
    "if , for example , we remove the three singular values from the wl - only fisher matrix , and then estimate the uncertainties in @xmath41 , we find @xmath172 over the range @xmath173 , when the distances are averaged over @xmath174 bins .",
    "this is 12 orders of magnitude better than the most ambitious targets for supernova measurements , and @xmath175 better than a spectroscopic bao survey of equivalent sky coverage .",
    "the final constraint on @xmath7 , therefore , comes down to the simple question of how well the non - wl data can constrain a variation of the form @xmath176 with the wl ccc data having locked down any other form of variation .",
    "our simplified analysis of the transverse bao survey available from the canonical wl survey data yields @xmath177    in our canonical survey , both wl information and sample - variance - limited transverse bao data are available over the range @xmath178 . in figure  [ klims ]",
    "we examine the dependence of the @xmath7 constraint on the redshift range over which these data are jointly available . reaching",
    "a 1% model - independent constraint on @xmath7 would require a massive spectroscopic bao survey , and/or obtaining ccc@xmath8bao data to @xmath179 .",
    "this is not a completely ridiculous prospect : the cmb anisotropy is , after all , a transverse bao measurement at @xmath180 .",
    "lensing of the cmb is also observable , but even more lensing information may be available using the 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the early stages of reionization @xcite .",
    "figure  [ klims ] also plots the @xmath7 limits that result from combining the transverse bao distance measurements with a supernova survey that yields independent 1% measurements of @xmath41 at @xmath181 steps in the range @xmath182 .",
    "we find that the sn data can cut @xmath183 in half for a transverse bao survey with @xmath184 , but the sn data are of only slight help ( 20% ) to a full - sky photo-@xmath185 bao survey .",
    "we note that the fisher uncertainties on @xmath7 are quite independent of the number of redshift shells or of any regularization constraint on the bias factor .",
    "they are also essentially independent of the assumed proxy correlation coefficient @xmath20 or the wl shape noise @xmath186 , because the nominal wl survey is already reducing the errors to insignificance in any mode for which it has power at all .",
    "the galaxy distribution parameters @xmath160 and @xmath161 are important only in that they have been used to determine the redshift range over which sample - variance - limited bao data are available . if we scale back to @xmath187 , @xmath188 , as might be expected for a deep ground - based survey @xcite , then the uncertainty in @xmath7 triples to @xmath189 for the nominal @xmath190 because the galaxy density drops below the bao sample - variance limit at @xmath191 . in a real survey ,",
    "the distribution of galaxies with accurately measured shapes will not , however , equal the distribution of those with accurately measured photometric redshifts , so a more detailed analysis is required in order to compare surveys .",
    "it is clear , however , that sky coverage , photo-@xmath185 accuracy , and redshift range of _ joint _ ccc - bao data are the key characteristics for this geometric constraint of @xmath7 .",
    "the wl ccc method depends upon measuring shear to very high accuracy .",
    "indeed the cosmology dependence of shear is so subtle that @xcite reverse the technique , and use the redshift dependence of galaxy - shear correlations as a test for systematic errors in shear measurement .",
    "any such shear systematics could substantially degrade the curvature constraints derived above .",
    "but we show here that the ccc data will be rich enough to solve simultaneously for cosmology and calibration systematics .",
    "the wl cross - correlation technique is insensitive to spurious shear signals caused by psf ellipticities , because they will not correlate with the proxy mass fields .",
    "calibration errors on the shear will , however , be important .",
    "we examine a model , similar to that of @xcite , in which the shear on source shell @xmath85 is mismeasured by a factor @xmath192 .",
    "this is simply incorporated into our governing equations by setting @xmath193 for @xmath194 .",
    "the fisher matrix now has the parameters @xmath195 as well .",
    "we assume a gaussian prior distribution on the @xmath195 for which they are all independent , with @xmath196 .",
    "we find the constraints on @xmath7 from the canonical survey are essentially unchanged if @xmath197 , a level that is probably achievable from ground or space observations . for @xmath198 , _",
    "i.e.  _  complete ignorance of the calibration , @xmath183 rises to 0.067 for the full - sky survey .",
    "the degradation in the curvature constraint is mild because even a `` self - calibrated '' ccc survey constrains the non - degenerate modes fairly well , and the nature of the degeneracies is only slightly expanded by the additional free parameters .",
    "a strictly @xmath34-dependent calibration error does not appear to be a problem for the curvature measurement .",
    "the fisher matrix constructed over parameters @xmath102 and @xmath7 , marginalized over the nuisance parameters , fully describes the cosmological information content of a ccc survey . distance information from transverse bao and supernovae can be summed into the same matrix .",
    "if we now consider each @xmath102 to correspond to a known redshift @xmath199 ( which was unimportant to the metric curvature determination ) , this fisher matrix describes our knowledge of the expansion history , and can be used to forecast constraints on parametric models of the expansion of the universe . to project the @xmath54@xmath7 fisher matrix onto some parameters @xmath200",
    ", we simply need to know @xmath201 .",
    "calibration errors on the shear can be included as described above ; biases @xmath202 in the photometric redshift scale are also easily included as they give rise to perturbations in the measured distances equal to @xmath203\\,\\delta z_p(z)$ ] .",
    "the distance - based analysis is also useful in that it has revealed the nature of the constraints from the various methods .",
    "the wl cross - correlations are completely blind to changes in @xmath204 that are quadratic ( linear ) in @xmath54 when @xmath7 is free ( fixed ) , but offer very strong limits on any other forms of variation in @xmath41 .",
    "when wl is used in combination with transverse bao and/or supernova measurements , the latter will serve primarily to constrain these low - order degeneracies .    as an example we consider a model for the expansion in which the free parameters are @xmath7 , @xmath15 , and the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the dark energy equation of state @xmath205 .",
    "note that @xmath206 . we will also quote the uncertainty in @xmath207 , the equation of state at the `` pivot redshift '' @xmath208 for which the model @xmath209 has uncorrelated fisher errors in @xmath207 and @xmath56 .",
    "we consider the constraints that arise from our canonical survey of weak lensing cross - correlations and photo-@xmath185 bao data .",

    "[ these are for full - sky surveys ; we will omit the factor @xmath212 for brevity here . ]",
    "the degeneracy is broken either by assuming a flat universe , by using the cmb distance to recombination , or by incorporating the transverse bao information over the same sky fraction . in the last case",
    ", @xmath7 has uncertainty 0.007 , which as expected is a much tighter constraint than the model - independent one above .",
    "we also note that the @xmath213 uncertainties of ( 0.013 , 0.057 ) are only slightly reduced by assuming flatness , although their @xmath214 shifts .",
    "inclusion of an accurate ( 0.1% ) angular - diameter distance to recombination from the cmb , as might be expected from planck , drops uncertainties on @xmath7 by a factor 3 , and a factor 2 for @xmath207 .",
    "the bj04 analysis asserts that ccc constraints improve without bound as @xmath215 .",
    "zhs did not concur , and we would now agree . since stebbins ( private communication ) proves that @xmath101 must be non - singular in the continuum limit ( and we have constructed its inverse ) , then the matrix @xmath216 will remain non - singular as the shape noise @xmath217 , meaning that the fisher information in remains finite . as a practical matter",
    ", we find that in the range of @xmath161 accessible to planned observations , ccc fisher information scales only slightly more slowly than @xmath215 .",
    "there is no simple scaling once we combine the ccc information with that from bao .",
    "the constraints are nearly independent of the choice of @xmath69 , again because the shape noise dominates sample variance .",
    "the bj04 derivation also leads to ccc - only parametric uncertainties that scale nearly inversely with the fiducial correlation coefficient @xmath20 . in the present analysis",
    "we see that such scaling arises if we consider only the effect of @xmath20 upon the @xmath133 factor of , and if we drop the left - hand term entirely .",
    "but if the effect of @xmath20 upon the @xmath134 terms in the noise matrix @xmath137 are also considered , then the dependence is more complex .",
    "we find that the ccc - only parametric constraints on flat universes scale more weakly than inversely with @xmath20 over the range 0.31.0 .",
    "the dependence is yet weaker once we include the bao information .",
    "figure  [ fcal ] plots the degradation of the parametric cosmology constraints as we weaken the prior on the calibration factors @xmath195 .",
    "there are three regimes : when the calibration is known _ a priori _ to better than @xmath218 , there is no significant degradation due to calibration errors . over the range @xmath219",
    ", the constraints continually degrade .",
    "calibration uncertainties above @xmath220 , however , cause no further degradation in cosmological constraints , as the ccc data solve for the systematic factors in a `` self - calibration '' regime .",
    "the self - calibration regime has parameter errors that are 1.62 times larger than the no - systematic regime .",
    "we conclude that lowering the calibration errors from 0.01 to 0.001 is equivalent to increasing the survey area by a factor of 2.54 , but interesting cosmological constraints are possible even with poor _ a priori _ calibration systematics .",
    "we find a similar scaling of uncertainties with calibration systematics for a shallower , ground - based survey .",
    "we alter the parameters of our fiducial survey to match those of zhs , namely we set @xmath184 , @xmath187 , @xmath221 , @xmath11 , and we use an equation of state @xmath222 instead of the @xmath56 form .",
    "the zhs analysis also allows for an arbitrary distribution of mass redshift within a shell , and accounts for the signal attenuation due to photo-@xmath185 errors .",
    "we compare to their @xmath223 case . for a fixed-@xmath224 model with only ccc information ,",
    "we obtain standard deviations on @xmath225 of ( 0.028 , 0.046 ) for @xmath210 , roughly @xmath226 smaller than zhs derive .",
    "we must lower @xmath20 to @xmath227 to obtain similar results .",
    "they also derive errors on @xmath228 when marginalized over @xmath15 with a prior of 0.03 . in this case our @xmath210 constraints of ( 0.03,0.11 ) compare to their ( 0.07,0.09)similar in size but different in shape .    the agreement to within factor two",
    "must be considered adequate at this time .",
    "while there remain substantial differences in the analytical approach to the ccc method , the discrepancies could easily be attributed to different assumptions about the correlation between the mass and the proxy field .",
    "zhs , as well as @xcite , take the galaxy distribution itself as the proxy field , and assume that the galaxies populate the mass via a pure poisson process . in this case",

    "thus when @xmath231 , @xmath20 drops below the 0.7 value of our fiducial model .",
    "this occurs at @xmath232 in our fiducial model for @xmath233 , whereas our fiducial model makes use of shear power to higher @xmath229 .",
    "were we to adopt a poisson model our parametric dark energy constraints would weaken .",
    "it is not clear , however , that the poisson model is appropriate once we approach the length scales of group- and galaxy - scale halos , which are currently suspected of harboring a single central galaxy with near - unity probability , plus satellites .",
    "the galaxy  mass covariance on small scales may thus be a good deal stronger than poisson models predict .",
    "this is surely a subject for further research .",
    "we may also compare to the ccc - only results with the bj04 method by reverting to the parameters assumed therein for the `` snap '' case : @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath11 , and a prior of 0.03 on @xmath15 .",
    "we find a pivot redshift @xmath214 and uncertainty @xmath237 that are the same in both cases , but @xmath56 is 35% lower with the present fisher matrix .",
    "this could be a result of some of the simplifications made by bj04 in construction of the covariance matrix for the @xmath97 in .",
    "alternatively it could derive from our present assumption that the convergence , mass , and proxy field values have a multivariate gaussian distribution , while bj04 have the less restrictive assumption that the @xmath238 have a gaussian distribution .",
    "a close comparison with @xcite is well beyond our present scope , because these authors include a parametric model for the bias function and limit the cross - correlation information to multipoles @xmath239 . in principle",
    "both differences can be accommodated in the present formalism , by switching to a spherical - harmonic decomposition , and by projecting parametric bias constraints onto the @xmath7@xmath102@xmath105 fisher matrix before marginalizing over the @xmath105 .",
    "a wl ccc survey reduces the errors on @xmath240 to @xmath241 , apart from a quadratic degeneracy with distance .",
    "hence the _ a priori _ theoretical constraints would need to be stronger than this in order to improve dark energy measurements .",
    "we also note that hu & jain take a poisson model for the mass - galaxy correlation , and assume a density of lens galaxy samples that is 2 orders of magnitude lower than assumed here , which we believe accounts for the cross - correlation constraints being much weaker in that work than in the present calculations .",
    "a short summary of this subsection is that there are currently multiple formalisms for analysis of ccc data , and they currently differ by up to a factor 2 in fisher uncertainties on parametric dark - energy models .",
    "further work is certainly required in order to understand the nature of the ccc constraints , and to understand our ability to reconstruct the mass distribution from the galaxy data .",
    "reparameterizing the observable galaxies by their ( dimensionless ) angular diameter distance @xmath54 rather than redshift @xmath185 makes it clear how the wl ccc method can provide model - independent geometric constraints on @xmath7 .",
    "this methodology also reveals that ccc data is degenerate under alterations to @xmath242 and @xmath243 by quadratic functions of @xmath54 , if @xmath7 is free .",
    "apart from three exact degeneracies , the cross - correlation strength , being a joint function of the lens and source distances , is very efficient at producing decoupled estimates of @xmath7 , the distances @xmath102 and the bias factors @xmath105 , and can even determine shear calibration factors @xmath195 for each source plane with modest degradations of factor @xmath244 in cosmological accuracy .    with sufficiently accurate photometric redshifts ,",
    "the same survey data used for weak lensing may be used to determine the transverse bao scale .",
    "this gives additional model - independent constraints on @xmath54 that are of lower precision than the ccc data , but are completely free of degeneracy .",
    "such a combined ccc - bao survey should yield uncertainties of @xmath245 on @xmath7 .",
    "we reiterate that such constraints are completely independent of any assumptions about the matter - energy content of the universe , any biases in photometric redshifts , or in fact any alterations to the friedmann equations or the deflection equations for light .",
    "they merely require that the robertson - walker metric be applicable to our universe .",
    "given the lack of viable dark - energy theories , it seems prudent to seek cosmological information that remains valid even if the acceleration is attributable to an alteration of general relativity rather than a previously unnoticed stress - energy contribution .    in the spirit of conservatism",
    ", we should note that the rw metric may not be sufficiently accurate .",
    "the clumpiness of the matter - energy distribution may invalidate our adoption of the filled - beam angular diameter distance , and a more sophisticated treatment may be required @xcite .",
    "it is not clear to what extent small - scale clumpiness can influence the apparent shear of galaxy - scale images as surveyed across the entire sky ",
    "this is quite a different regime from studies of strongly lensed quasars or supernovae for which the dyer - roeder distances have been most carefully studied .",
    "the curvature measurement is limited by the ability to break the wl ccc degeneracy , _",
    "i.e.  _  by the accuracy and redshift span of the bao or sn measurements of angular - diameter distances .",
    "our baseline constraint assumes photo-@xmath185 bao information for @xmath178 over the full sky .",
    "a massive spectroscopic bao survey would offer substantial improvement , but type ia supernova studies would not offer substantial improvement over full - sky photo-@xmath185 bao unless systematic uncertainties in snia peak magnitudes could be brought well below 1% and the redshift range extended beyond @xmath246 .",
    "inclusion of lensing and acoustic - scale information from the epochs of recombination or reionization would help significantly .",
    "the parametric dark - energy constraints derived from the ccc@xmath8bao information are more fluid , as our derivation has made somewhat arbitrary assumptions about the correlation between the true mass and the proxy mass derived from the galaxy distribution .",
    "the simplifying assumptions about gaussianity , uncorrelated mass shells , and uncorrelated lines of sight should also be improved upon .",
    "the spherical - harmonic - based fisher analyses of @xcite , @xcite , and zhs are in this respect superior to our treatment of uncorrelated lines of sight .",
    "we note however that the fisher matrix from is applicable to multipole coefficients . more work is also required to examine the impact of finite photo-@xmath185 precision on the ccc constraints , as per zhs .",
    "a weak lensing survey would produce other kinds of information which we have not used in this analysis . power - spectrum @xcite and bispectrum @xcite tomography , and wl cluster counts @xcite constrain dark energy once a model for the growth of structure @xmath247 is specified .",
    "one could augment our current @xmath248 fisher matrix with growth factors @xmath249 to produce a non - parametric information estimate , which could then be projected onto the parameters of specific models , even those which predict changes to the usual equation for linear growth of perturbations in an expanding universe .",
    "the method proposed herein for metric constraints on curvature , and for strong parametric constraints on cosmology , will require substantial practical advances before implementation , plus additional theoretical work .",
    "progress in high - accuracy shape and photo-@xmath185 measurement is needed , as is research into intrinsic galaxy - shape correlations @xcite , non - linearities in lensing @xcite , and methods of reconstructing the matter distribution from a galaxy distribution .",
    "nonetheless the wl ccc method shares with the bao method the ability to generate extremely robust and model - independent cosmological constraints , particularly when they are used in combination .",
