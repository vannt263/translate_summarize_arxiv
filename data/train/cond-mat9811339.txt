    "<S> to stay within the limits of the camera sensitivity , we make sure that the optical density remains below 3 ( 95  % absorption ) . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation to relatively dilute samples could be circumvented by taking an image with a laser beam detuned from the atomic resonance . </S>",
    "<S> however , we found that the dispersive nature of the cloud for a non - zero detuning makes the accurate calibration of the images more delicate .    </S>",
    "<S> the value used for @xmath60 takes into account the average intensity factor ( 7/15 ) for the atomic transition , assuming that the atoms are uniformly spread over the 5 zeeman sublevels of the @xmath63 ground level after the 32  ms free fall . </S>",
    "<S> when we analyze our data using the corresponding resonant cross - section value for @xmath60 , we find a small ( @xmath64 ) discrepancy between the measured bec transition temperature @xmath65 with the predicted one @xmath66 @xcite : @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute it to a reduction of the absorption cross - section due to a finite linewidth of the probe laser , which results in an under - evaluation of the number of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the number of atoms given in the following have been corrected to take into account this imperfection of the imaging laser .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical image consists in two features : ( i ) a central elliptic region of high density corresponds to the condensate cloud . at @xmath68 , the total size of this region is @xmath69m@xmath70 m . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) a slightly larger quasi - isotropic region corresponds to the uncondensed fraction of the atomic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the images is made by a 3-step fitting procedure . in a first step </S>",
    "<S> we fit the total image with the sum of a gaussian function , representing the uncondensed fraction , and a function corresponding to the integration along the @xmath58 axis of a paraboloidal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the latter describes in the thomas - fermi limit @xcite the equilibrium density profile of the condensate within the harmonic trap , and it is known to remain valid ( with a scaling factor ) after a ballistic expansion @xcite . the quality of this first fit is subsequently improved in two steps where ( i ) we fit only the part of the image which contains no condensate again by a gaussian function to derive the temperature @xmath71 , ( ii ) we substract the gaussian distribution derived in this way and we fit only the central component to derive precisely the number of condensed atoms @xmath72 . the total number of atoms @xmath73 is finally evaluated from the integral of @xmath74 over the whole image .    to accurately measure </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the number @xmath72 of atoms in the condensate , drifts and fluctuations in the initial number of condensed atoms and in the temperature have to be suppressed as far as possible . </S>",
    "<S> the most important limitation to experimental accuracy is the drift of the magnetic field minimum @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> a decrease of @xmath37 by only @xmath75  t will diminish @xmath76 by 7khz . because the cold atomic samples are prepared by evaporating down to a _ fixed _ final rf frequency , this decrease corresponds to a temperature increase of @xmath777khz@xmath78nk . </S>",
    "<S> this value has to be compared to our typical transition temperature @xmath79nk . in order to keep the initial fraction of condensed atoms stable around 75% , the magnetic field minimum @xmath37 has to be stable to within less than a few @xmath80  t. this is a very stringent condition because the value @xmath81  t is obtained by subtracting two large ( @xmath82  t ) nearly equal fields .    in normal operation </S>",
    "<S> we have observed drifts in the value of @xmath37 on the order of @xmath83  t. we have identified temperature changes of the magnetic field coils and their support structure as primary source for these drifts . </S>",
    "<S> temperature changes lead to thermal dilations by a few @xmath84 m that can account for the observed drifts . </S>",
    "<S> to get rid of these drifts we have automatized the experiment and data acquisition completely . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to leave the laboratory while the computer is producing one condensate every @xmath8535s , varying the relaxation time of the cloud in the magnetic trap automatically . </S>",
    "<S> after 15 minutes the setup is in thermal equilibrium and drifts of @xmath37 are below @xmath86  t during one data series ( @xmath851.5 hours ) .    to reduce systematic errors due to residual drifts in @xmath37 even further , </S>",
    "<S> we have put a set of 16 different relaxation times @xmath50 in random order and repeated this same set 9 times in a row , thus preparing @xmath87 condensates in total . for each relaxation time </S>",
    "<S> we measure the number of atoms remaining in the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate their average @xmath88 .    </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath89 of condensate atoms is shown in fig.2 on a logarithmic scale . </S>",
    "<S> the marked non - exponential decay indicates that in the beginning the atoms are lost mainly by two- or three - body inelastic collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the initial and final numbers of atoms in the condensate are respectively 300000 and 17000 , and the initial and final average condensate densities are @xmath90  @xmath3 and @xmath91  @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the sample is constant at @xmath92  nk over the measured time interval .    </S>",
    "<S> we now compare the measured atom number in the condensate with the solution of the differential equation governing the time evolution of @xmath72 . in a first step we consider only collisions between condensate atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the loss rates due to two- and three - body collisions are described by terms @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the rate coefficients for two- and three - body collisions , and where we put for a function @xmath97 : @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals can be calculated in the thomas - fermi limit of a parabolic condensate density , giving @xmath99 and @xmath100 , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath103 nm denotes the scattering length and @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the thomas - fermi approximation can be checked in fig .  3 , where we have plotted the full width @xmath105 of the condensate as a function of @xmath72 , together with a fit using the modelling function @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath107 m , in very good agreement ( to within @xmath108 ) with the thomas - fermi prediction @xmath109 m @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have not been able to find an analytical solution to the differential equation describing both two- _ and _ three - body collisions at the same time , but we can solve the equation in the presence of either two- or three - body collisions : @xmath110 @xmath111    the dotted and dashed lines in fig.2 show solutions of the differential equations for two- and three - body collisions that fit the experimental data best . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath112 for two - body collisions and @xmath113 for three - body collisions , where the error is purely statistical at this stage . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of the condensate @xmath114 is determined by small - angle collisions with the thermal background gas and expected to be smaller than the lifetime of an uncondensed cloud . indeed a small energy on the order of @xmath115nk ( the chemical potential ) is sufficient to eject the atoms out of the condensate , whereas an energy of @xmath116mk is necessary to make an atom leave the magnetic trap . </S>",
    "<S> we found a lifetime for thermal clouds @xmath117s , which contradicts the two - body hypothesis .    </S>",
    "<S> the error bars in the inset show the statistical error for @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> the noise on the number of atoms can be read directly from the length of the error bars and it amounts to only 1% . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the experimental data and the best fit is shown with dashed and dotted lines . whereas the residue of the fit to a three - body decay law ( dashed line ) stays most of the time within the bounds </S>",
    "<S> given by the statistical error , the fit to a two - body decay law has deviations by several @xmath60 for many points . on the basis of our model , a pure two - body decay ( including @xmath119 ) </S>",
    "<S> can therefore be ruled out with certainty , whereas a pure three - body decay is well compatible with the data .    </S>",
    "<S> more quantitatively , the expected mean value of a @xmath120 distribution with 13 degrees of freedom ( 16 data points minus 3 fit parameters ) is 13 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath120 value for the two - body fit is @xmath121 , corresponding to a rejection confidence much below @xmath122 , whereas the @xmath120 value for three - body decay of @xmath123 corresponds to what is to be expected statistically .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis so far relies on solving the differential equation for @xmath124 , which implies two drawbacks :   ( 1 )  it neglects collisions of condensate atoms with the thermal component of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a very good approximation , because the central density of the thermal cloud @xmath125 reaches @xmath126 of the mean condensate density @xmath127 in the measured time interval .   </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 )  we can not take account of both two - body and three - body collisions at the same time , making it impossible to place a stringent upper limit on the two - body rate coefficient @xmath95 .    in presence of collisions with the thermal cloud with density @xmath128 </S>",

    "<S> we have taken into account the role of the symmetry of the condensate wave function with respect to particle exchange @xcite .    in view of the excellent quality of the data </S>",
    "<S> we now calculate the time derivative of @xmath130 ( equal to @xmath131 ) and its statistical error directly from the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we find the parabola that passes through the three data points ln@xmath132 , ln@xmath133 , ln@xmath134 and take the slope of the parabola at time @xmath135 as the value of @xmath136ln@xmath137 at time @xmath135 . ] </S>",
    "<S> the result is plotted in fig.4 as a function of @xmath138 , the term multiplying @xmath96 in  eq.([dn / ndt ] ) : @xmath139 which is evaluated in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> points to the right correspond to large atom numbers and short relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> if two - body collisions are negligible , eq.([dn / ndt ] ) tells us that @xmath131 depends linearly on @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.4 reveals exactly this linear dependence , the fit yielding @xmath140s and @xmath141 the first error represents the _ statistical _ error , while the second , dominating error gives the _ systematic _ error of 20% due essentially to the calibration of the number of atoms detected .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now place an upper limit on the two - body rate coefficient by fitting @xmath131 as a function of @xmath138 and @xmath142 . the fit yields @xmath143@xmath144s@xmath7 and @xmath145@xmath146s@xmath7 . hence we conclude that the two - body rate @xmath95 is smaller than @xmath147@xmath146s@xmath7 for @xmath148  mt .    in the previous analysis </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that for each three - body collision , only the three atoms which are directly involved in the collision are lost from the trap . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , secondary collisions between condensate atoms and fast atoms emerging from a three - body collison might augment the loss of condensate atoms per three - body collision to a value larger than three . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the mean free path of a fast atom by estimating the collisional cross section from a semiclassical model , and obtain @xmath149  @xmath150 for a relative velocity larger than 10  ms@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean free path ( @xmath151 m ) is then larger than the transverse size of the condensate ( @xmath152 m full width ) , so that this effect can not change the results of our analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> we now briefly compare our results with previous measurements and predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the three - body recombination rate has been measured for rb atoms prepared in the low hyperfine state @xmath153 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result for that state is @xmath154  @xmath144s@xmath7 for condensed atoms , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ 3 times smaller than the result found here for the stretched state @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> two theoretical predictions have been made for the three - body recombination rate of rb , based on different assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> a first calculation , based on the jastrow approximation , led to a very small value @xmath155  @xmath144s@xmath7 for condensed atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a second prediction considers the case of a large and positive scattering length @xmath156 for the binary elastic collision , corresponding to the existence of a weakly bound state @xcite . </S>",
