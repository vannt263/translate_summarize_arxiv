    "our knowledge of hadronic structure is based on the hadronic spectroscopy and the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data . in the former picture",
    "quarks are massive particles and their bound states describe the static properties of hadrons ; while the interpretation of dis data relies upon the quarks of qcd lagrangian with very small mass . the hadronic structure in this picture is intimately connected with the presence of a large number of partons(quarks and gluons ) .",
    "the two types of quarks not only differ in mass , but also on other important properties . for example",
    ", the color charge of quark field in qcd lagrangian is ill - defined and is not gauge invariant , reflecting the color of gluons in an interacting theory . on the other hand ,",
    "color associated with a constituent quark ( cq ) is a well defined entity .",
    "it has been recently shown that @xcite@xcite one can perturbatively dress a qcd lagrangian field to all orders and construct a cq in conformity with the color confinement . from this point of view",
    "a cq is defined as a quasi - particle emerging from the dressing of valence quark with gluons and @xmath4 pairs in qcd .",
    "+ of course , the concept of cq as an intermediate step between the quarks of qcd lagrangian and hadrons is not new .",
    "in fact , in the context of @xmath5 long before altarelli and cabibo @xcite have used them .",
    "hwa in his elaborated work termed them as _ valon _ , extended it and showed its application to many physical processes @xcite . in ref.[2 ] it is suggested that the concept of dressed quark and gluon might be useful in the area of jet physics and heavy quark effective theory . despite the ever presence of cq no one has calculated its content and partonic structure without resorting to hadronic data and the process of deconvolution .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold : ( a ) we will evaluate the structure of a cq in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd . ( b )",
    "we will verify its conformity with the structure function data of nucleon and pion for which there are ample data available .",
    "( c ) in the process , however , we will notice that additional refinements are needed to account for the violation of gottfried sum rule ( gsr ) and the effect of binding of cq s to form a physical hadron .",
    "by definition , a cq is a universal building block for every hadron , that is , its structure is common to all hadrons and generated perturbatively .",
    "once its structure is evaluated , in principle it would permit to calculate the structure of any hadron .",
    "in doing so we will follow the philosophy that in a dis experiment at high enough @xmath6 it is the structure of a cq which is being probed and at sufficiently low value of @xmath6 this structure can not be resolved thus , a cq behaves as valence quark and hadron is viewed as the bound state of its cq s . under these criteria",
    "partons of dis experiments are components of cq and at high @xmath6 one can write for a u - type cq its structure as follows : @xmath7 where all the functions on the right - hand side are the probability functions for quarks having momentum fraction @xmath8 of a u - type constituent quark at @xmath6 .",
    "similar expression can be written for a d - type cq . defining the singlet ( s ) and nonsinglet ( ns ) cq distribution functions as : @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the favored distribution describing the structure function of a quark within a cq of the same flavor while unfavored distribution @xmath12 describes the structure function of any quark of different flavor within the cq .",
    "@xmath13 is the number of active flavors . in terms of singlet and nonsinglet distributions they are as follows : @xmath14 @xmath15 having expressed all the structure functions of cq s in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 we now go to the moment space and define the moments of these distributions as : @xmath16 @xmath17 the subscription @xmath18 stands for s , ns .",
    "using charge symmetry , in the following we will refer to cq distribution only in proton . + in the nlo approximation",
    "the dependence of the running coupling constant , @xmath19 on @xmath6 is given by : @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the moments of ns and s in the nlo are : @xmath23(\\frac{\\alpha_{s}(q^{2})}{\\alpha_{s}(q_{0}^{2})})^{\\gamma_{qq}^{(0)n/2\\beta_{0}}}\\ ] ] @xmath24+(+\\longleftrightarrow -)\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are anomalous dimension metrices@xcite and @xmath28 denote the eigenvalues of one - loop anomalous dimension matrix @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath29\\ ] ] and @xmath30 is given by : @xmath31 the quantities @xmath32 , the leading order anomalous dimentions , given in ref.[4 ] , are related to @xmath33 in our notations .",
    "@xmath34 is the evolution parameter defined as : @xmath35 the coefficients @xmath36 and can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we have taken our initial scale @xmath37 @xmath3 and @xmath38 gev .",
    "it seems that evolution of parton distributions from such a low value of @xmath39 is not justified theoretically .",
    "the above value of @xmath40 corresponds to a distance of 0.36 _ fm _ which is roughly equal to or slightly less than the radius of a cq .",
    "it may be objected that such a distances are probably too large for a meaningful pure perturbative treatment .",
    "we note that @xmath41 has the property that it becomes @xmath42 as @xmath6 is extrapolated to @xmath43 , which is beyond the region of validity .",
    "this mathematical boundary condition signifies that the internal structure of a cq can not be resolved at @xmath40 in the nlo approximation .",
    "consequently , when this property is applied to eq.(19 ) bellow , the structure function of the nucleon becomes directly related to @xmath44 at those values of @xmath40 , that is , @xmath40 is the leading order effective value at which the hadron can be considered as consisting only of three ( two ) cq s , for baryons ( mesons ) .",
    "in fact our results are only meaningful for @xmath45 @xmath3 .",
    "as it is stated above , the moments of the cq structure function , @xmath41 are expressed completely in terms of the evolution parameter , @xmath34 , of eq .",
    "( 13 ) . from the theoretical standpoint ,",
    "both @xmath46 and @xmath40 depend on the order of the moments @xmath47 . in this work",
    "we have assumed that they are independent of @xmath47 , hence introducing some degrees of approximation to the @xmath6 evolution of the valence and sea quarks .",
    "however , on one hand there are other contributions like target - mass effects , which add uncertainties to the theoretical predictions of perturbative qcd , while on the other hand since we are dealing with the cq , there is no experimental data to invalidate an @xmath47 independent @xmath46 assumption .",
    "the moments of valence and sea quarks in a cq are : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 are given above . evaluating @xmath51 and @xmath52 at any @xmath6 or @xmath34 is now straight forward .",
    "using inverse mellin transform techniques , following forms for the valence and sea quark distributions inside a cq is obtained in the nlo : @xmath53 @xmath54\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath19 , etc .",
    "are functions of @xmath6 through the evolution parameter @xmath34 . the same form as in eq.(17 )",
    "is obtained for gluon distribution in a cq but only with different parameters .",
    "functional form of them is a polynomial of order three in @xmath34 and are given in the appendix .",
    "we notice that the following sum rule reflecting the fact that each cq contains only one valence quark is satisfied for all values of @xmath6 : @xmath58 substituting these results in eq.(1 ) completes the evaluation of a constituent quark structure function in nlo . in figure",
    "( 1 ) various parton distributions inside a cq is plotted .",
    "in previous section we calculated the nlo structure of a cq . in this section",
    "we will use the convolution theorem to calculate the structure function of proton , @xmath59 , and that of a pion .",
    "let us denote the structure function of a cq by @xmath60 and the probability of finding a cq carrying momentum fraction @xmath61 of the hadron by @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding structure function of the hadron , using the convolution theorem is as follows : @xmath63 where summation runs over the number of cq s in a particular hadron .",
    "also notice that @xmath62 is independent of the nature of the probe and its @xmath6 value .",
    "@xmath62 in effect , describes the wave function of hadron in cq representation containing all the complications due to confinement . from the theoretical point of view",
    "this function can not be evaluated accurately . to facilitate phenomenological analysis , following ref.[4 ] we assume a simple form for the exclusive cq distribution in proton and pion as follows : @xmath64 @xmath65 integrating over unwanted momenta",
    ", we can arrive at inclusive distribution of individual cq : @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 similarly expression for @xmath69 with the interchange of @xmath70 . in the above equations",
    "@xmath71 is euler beta function and its arguments are fixed using the sum rule : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "numerical values are : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in figure",
    "( 2 ) the cq distributions in proton and @xmath79 are shown .",
    "we stress that cq distributions in hadrons are independent of @xmath6 and the nature of probe being used .",
    "now it is possible to determine various parton distributions in a hadron .",
    "for proton we can write : @xmath80",
    "@xmath81 the above equation represents the contribution of constituent quarks to the nucleon sea .",
    "comparing with data on proton structure functions shows that the results fall short of representing the experimental data by a 3 - 5 percent .",
    "this is due in our opinion , to the fact that cq is not free in a hadron but they interact with each other in forming the bound states .",
    "that means , there are some soft gluons in the nucleon besides the cq s . in the process of formation of bound state",
    ", a cq emits gluon which in turn decays into @xmath82 pairs which gives a residual component to the partons in a hadron . in our picture",
    "there is no room in the cq structure for breaking the @xmath0 symmetry of the sea but after creation of @xmath82 pair from the emitted gluon , these quarks can recombine with cq to fluctuate into meson - nucleon state which breaks the symmetry of the nucleon see . in what follows",
    "we will compute this component , its contribution to the nucleon structure function and violation of gottfried sum rule following the preswcription used in @xcite @xcite . in order to distinguish these partons from those confined inside the cq",
    ", we will term them as _",
    "inherent partons_. although this component is intimately related to the bound state problem , and hence it has a non - perturbative origin , for not so small values of @xmath6 we will calculate it perturbatively for the process of @xmath83 at an initial value of @xmath84 where @xmath85 is still small enough .",
    "the corresponding splitting functions are as follows : @xmath86 @xmath87 for the joint probability distribution of the process at hand , we get : @xmath88 the splitting functions and the @xmath89 , above are that of the leading order rather than nlo .",
    "we do not expect it should make much of a difference since , its contribution to the whole structure function is only a few percent as can be seen in figure ( 3 ) . in the above equation @xmath90",
    "is a factor depending on @xmath6 and @xmath91 is the constituent quark distribution in the proton given previously .",
    "the same process , however , also can be a source of @xmath0 symmetry breaking of nucleon sea and resulting in @xmath92 , and hence the violation of gottfried sum rule ( gsr ) .",
    "there are several explanations forthis observation such as flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea @xcite @xcite , isospin symmetry breaking between proton and neutron , pauli blocking , _",
    "etc_. one of these explanations fits well within our model .",
    "it was proposed by eichten , inchliffe and quigg @xcite that valence quark fluctuates into quark and a pion .",
    "in other words a nucleon can fluctuate into a meson - nucleon state .",
    "this idea is appealing in our model and can be calculated rather easily . in our model after a pair of _ inherent _ @xmath4 created a @xmath93 can couple to a d - type cq to form an intermediate @xmath94 while the @xmath95 quark combines with the other two u - type cq s to form a @xmath96 .",
    "this is the lowest @xmath97 fluctuation .",
    "similarly a @xmath98 can fluctuate into the @xmath99 state .",
    "since @xmath96 state is more massive than @xmath47 state , then the probability of @xmath98 fluctuation will dominate over @xmath97 fluctuation which naturally leads to an excess of @xmath98 pairs over @xmath97 in the proton sea .",
    "this process is depicted in figure ( 4 ) .",
    "probability of formation of a meson - barion state can be written as in ref . [",
    "8 ] : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the joint probability of finding a cq with momentum fraction @xmath61 and an inherent quark or anti - quark of momentum fraction @xmath8 in the proton .",
    "@xmath102 is the probability of recombining a cq of momentum @xmath61 with an inherent quark of momentum @xmath8 to form a meson of momentum fraction @xmath103 in the proton .",
    "the evaluation of both of these probability functions are discussed in @xcite for a more general case and an earlier , but pioneering , version also proposed in @xcite . in the present case these functions are much simpler . guided by works done in ref .",
    "[ 8,12,13 ] we can write : @xmath104",
