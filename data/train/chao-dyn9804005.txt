    "one of the objectives of time series analysis is to study the detailed structure of the equations of the underlying dynamical system which govern its temporal evolution .",
    "this includes the number of independent variables , the form of the flow functions , the nonlinearities in them and parameters of the system  @xcite .",
    "this paper concentrates on the last aspect , i.e. , estimating the parameters of a nonlinear system from a single time series when partial information about the system dynamics is available  @xcite .    assuming that the number of independent variables and the structure of underlying dynamical evolution equations for a nonlinear system is known , we address the problem of determining the values of the parameters . in particular , given a time series for a single variable ( a scalar time series ) , we suggest a simple method which enables us to determine values of the unknown parameters dynamically . the unknown parameters may or may not appear in the evolution equation of the variable for which the time series is given . for this purpose",
    ", we employ a combination of two techniques , namely synchronization and adaptive control .",
    "owing mainly to the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions , engineering and controlling a nonlinear chaotic system requires a careful analysis .",
    "feedback based synchronization techniques are investigated in this context to force a chaotic system , to go to a desired periodic or chaotic orbit .",
    "such control mechanisms were suggested by pecora and carroll  @xcite and many others  @xcite with an aim to synchronize two chaotic orbits and to stabilize unstable periodic orbits or fixed points . in such mechanisms ,",
    "some of the independent variables are used as drive variables and the remaining variables are found to synchronize with the desired trajectory under suitable conditions .",
    "there have been many other important attempts in controlling chaotic systems using synchronization  @xcite .",
    "the other method that we use is that of adaptive control which is used to bring back a system , deviated from a stable fixed point due to changes in parameters and variables , to its original state .",
    "this mechanism was suggested by huberman and lumer  @xcite .",
    "it was generalized for an unstable periodic orbit and a chaotic orbit by john and amritkar  @xcite where it was shown that it is possible to synchronize with an unstable periodic orbit or a chaotic orbit starting from a random initial condition and different value of the parameter .    in this paper , we show that a simple combination of synchronization and adaptive control methods similar to that described by john and amritkar  @xcite can be used for extracting information contained in a scalar time series .",
    "we approach the problem by considering a dynamical system , in which the number of independent variables and the structure of evolution equations are assumed to be known .",
    "a linear feedback function is added to the variable corresponding to that for which the time series is given .",
    "this acts as a _ drive _ variable .",
    "the feedback serves the purpose of synchronization of all the system variables .",
    "the feedback function in our case is proportional to the difference between the new and the old values of the drive variable .",
    "the system variables respond to this feedback by synchronizing with the corresponding values in the original system . in the context of application of synchronization techniques to telecommunications ,",
    "the new system to be reconstructed is often referred to as the _ receiver _ whereas the old system , from which the time series is made available is termed the _ transmitter_. we will borrow the terminology , although the meanings of terms in the two cases are not exactly identical .",
    "the synchronization as described above becomes exact when the receiver parameters are set equal to those of the transmitter and takes place whenever the _ conditional lyapunov exponents _ ( cle s ) as defined in the next section are all negative .",
    "now assume that precise values of only a few of the transmitter parameters are known to the receiver system .",
    "we show that , in such a case it is possible to write simple evolution equations for the unknown parameters ( initially set to arbitrary values ) , which when coupled with the system equations , yield precise values of all the state variables and the unknown parameters asymptotically to any desired accuracy .",
    "our method comprises of raising the unknown parameters to the status of variables of a higher dimensional dynamical system which evolve according to a simple set of evolution equations .",
    "the receiver forms a subsystem of this higher dimensional system which in addition contains the evolution equation for the unknown parameters .",
    "the input to this higher dimensional system is a scalar time series obtained from the transmitter system .",
    "thus our method uses a dynamical algorithm to estimate the parameters which are obtained asymptotically .",
    "we note that the method of estimating parameters using synchronization and minimization as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is essentially a static method .",
    "the problem of estimating model parameters was also handled in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which starting with an ansatz , the optimal equations for parameter evolution are obtained .",
    "our method gives a simpler and a systematic derivation of the parameter control loop and in many cases , a better convergence rate .",
    "it is well known that a great deal of information about a chaotic system is contained in the time series of its variables .",
    "techniques like embedding the time series in a space with chosen dimensionality are available for studying the universality class and other _ global _ features of the system .",
    "our results suggest that a scalar time series , in addition to the information about the universality class also contains information about the exact values of the parameters of the underlying dynamical system , including the ones which appear in the evolution of other variables .",
    "the method and the required notation is developed in section ii .",
    "section iii consists of illustrations for lorenz and rssler systems and a set of equations in plasma physics .",
    "the effect of noise in the transmitter system is studied in section iv .",
    "finally we conclude in section v with a brief summary of results along with a few remarks .",
    "in this section , we will describe our method of parameter estimation , for a general system with @xmath0 variables and @xmath1 parameters .",
    "we will first consider the case when only one parameter is unknown to the receiver .",
    "consider an autonomous , nonlinear dynamical system with evolution equations , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an @xmath0-dimensional state vector whose evolution is described by the function @xmath4 .",
    "the dot represents time differentiation and @xmath5 are the parameters of the system .",
    "now suppose a time series for one variable , which without loss of generality can be taken as @xmath6 , is given as an output of the above system and in addition suppose the functional form of @xmath7 , and the values of all the parameters @xmath8 are known while the time evolution of the remaining variables and value of @xmath9 , the @xmath10 parameter are not known , then formally the problem at hand consists of writing a set of evolution equations which will yield the information about the unknown parameter and also other variables . with the unknown parameter @xmath9",
    "written explicitly for convenience we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ transmitter ] ) as , @xmath11    now we introduce a new system of variables @xmath12 whose evolution equations have identical form to that of @xmath13 .",
    "we fix @xmath14 as the drive variable and a feedback is introduced in the evolution of @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters are also the same except the one corresponding to the unknown parameter which will be set to an arbitrary initial value denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "thus the receiver system will have the structure , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a feedback function which depends upon the drive variable @xmath14 and the variable @xmath6 .",
    "the feedback function can be most simply chosen to be proportional to the difference @xmath18 and the evolution for the drive variable @xmath14 can be written as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is called the feedback constant .",
    "more general forms of the feedback function are also possible and give similar results .",
    "the receiver system is formed by eqs .",
    "( [ receive ] ) and ( [ feedback ] ) .",
    "if the parameter @xmath15 in these equations is set precisely equal to @xmath21 then the two sets of variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , after a transient time , evolve in tandem and show exact synchronization under suitable conditions , but because the value of @xmath21 is _ unknown _ to the receiver system , this does not happen .",
    "the solution is to set the parameter @xmath15 to an arbitrary initial value , while all others are set to the known values @xmath24 , and _ adapt _ it through a suitable evolution equation .",
    "the resulting @xmath25-dimensional system then evolves all the receiver variables to correct values of the corresponding transmitter variables and simultaneously settles the value of @xmath15 to that of @xmath21 provided all the cle s as defined in the next subsection , are negative .",
    "the equation for evolution of the @xmath15 is chosen similar to those used in adaptive control mechanisms  @xcite , and quite generally can have the form , @xmath26 the form of the function @xmath27 that we have chosen is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is another parameter in the combined @xmath25  -dimensional system formed by eqs .",
    "( [ receive ] ) , ( [ feedback ] ) and ( [ adaptation ] ) .",
    "we call it the _ stiffness constant_. the values of @xmath20 and @xmath29 together control the convergence rates involved in synchronization and adaptive evolution . towards the end of this subsection",
    ", we will show that the above form of function @xmath27 ( eq .",
    "( [ adaptation ] ) ) is obtained as a result of dynamic minimization of the synchronization error .    the last factor in the eq .",
    "( [ adaptation ] ) , @xmath30 , needs some elaboration . in general",
    "the parameter @xmath15 may or may not explicitly appear in the evolution function @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ drive ] ) .",
    "this stresses a need for identification of two separate cases .",
    "if the function @xmath32 explicitly depends on @xmath15 , then the calculation of @xmath33 is straightforward .    in case @xmath15",
    "does not appear in the function @xmath32 explicitly , it still indirectly affects the evolution of @xmath14 .",
    "the information about the value of @xmath21 is contained in the given time series @xmath34 .",
    "function @xmath33 `` taps '' this dependence .",
    "the calculation of @xmath33 in this case , when function @xmath32 does not explicitly depend on @xmath15 needs to be done carefully .",
    "this is done as follows :    consider the system formed by ( [ receive ] ) and ( [ feedback ] ) in which , a change in the variable @xmath14 in one time step due to a change in the parameter @xmath35 can be estimated as follows .",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath38 variable of the receiver , such that its evolution contains the parameter @xmath15 explicitly .",
    "thus the last of the above equations gives us , @xmath39    a further complication arises if the variable @xmath37 itself does not appear in the function @xmath32 explicitly .",
    "in such a case further dependences appearing in more time steps may be considered .",
    "note that here , @xmath37 may appear in more than one flow functions and a summation over all such functions becomes necessary . in this case we can write , @xmath40 thus the last factor in eq .",
    "( [ adaptation ] ) takes the form , @xmath41 one such case appears in the example of lorenz system , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "now , when more than one parameters of the transmitter are to be estimated , one may use a set of equations similar in form to that of eq .",
    "( [ adaptation ] ) .",
    "we will use such a set when we discuss lorenz system where it will be assumed that two or three parameters of the lorenz system are unknown to the receiver system .",
    "we note that a parameter estimation algorithm as described in ref .",
    "@xcite can also be used in the estimation of more than one unknown parameters .",
    "it uses autosynchronization method based on an active passive decomposition ( apd ) of a dynamical system  @xcite and starts from an ansatz for the parameter control .",
    "in contrast , our method is a dynamical minimization for the synchronization error .",
    "this can be seen as follows :    let us define the dynamical synchronization error @xmath42 as , @xmath43 where @xmath15 is the receiver parameter corresponding to the unknown parameter and @xmath14 is the drive variable .",
    "we note that if @xmath15 takes precisely the value of @xmath21 , then the transmitter and receiver synchronize , which makes the error as defined by eq .",
    "( [ errdef ] ) minimum , i.e. zero . to go to this minimum , we want to evolve @xmath15 such that it will go to a value making @xmath44 minimum . with an analogy to an equation in mechanics , where an overdamped particle goes to a mimimum of a potential , we write the following , @xmath45 which leads to , @xmath46 further , to the lowest order in @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ minimisn0 ] ) can be written as , @xmath49 where @xmath29 is a proportionality constant .",
    "this equation is same as eq .",
    "( [ adaptation ] ) .    in the next subsection",
    "we will define the _ conditional lyapunov exponents _ ( cle s ) for the newly reconstructed receiver system and state the condition for the combination of synchronization and adaptive control to work convergently such that parameter estimation is possible .",
    "consider the transmitter equations ( eq .",
    "( [ transmit ] ) ) and the receiver equations ( eqs .",
    "( [ receive ] ) , ( [ feedback ] ) and ( [ adaptation ] ) ) .",
    "convergence between two trajectories of these systems means that the receiver variables evolve such that the differences @xmath50 and @xmath51 all evolve to zero . in the @xmath25-dimensional space formed by these differences",
    ", origin acts as a fixed point and the condition for the algorithm to work is the same as the stability condition for this fixed point .",
    "if the above differences are considered to form an @xmath25-dimensional vector @xmath52 then the differential @xmath53 evolves as , @xmath54 where the jacobian matrix @xmath55 is given by , @xmath56 where the function @xmath27 describes the evolution of the parameter @xmath57 as in eq .",
    "( [ genadapt ] ) and the derivatives in the matrix @xmath55 are evaluated at @xmath58 which is a fixed point .",
    "the condition for the convergence of our procedure is that the real part of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath55 or _ conditional lyapunov exponents _ ( cle s ) are all less than zero .",
    "it can be seen from the above matrix equation that choices of the feedback constant and the stiffness constant affect the values of conditional lyapunov exponents .",
    "thus the method will work convergently only for suitably chosen @xmath20 and @xmath29 .",
    "when these are chosen such that the largest of the cle s become positive , the algorithm does not work due to diverging trajectories .    in the next section",
    "we will illustrate the method using the examples of lorenz and rssler flows and a set of equations in plasma physics .",
    "as a first example , we study the lorenz system . we divide the discussion in two parts . in the first , we present the results when only a single parameter is estimated in a lorenz system .",
    "three different cases are discussed in detail . in the later part ,",
    "we extend our method for the case when more parameters are to be estimated .",
    "the lorenz system is given by , @xmath59 where @xmath60 form the state space and @xmath61 form the three dimensional parameter space .",
    "now assume that the time series for @xmath62 is given , and two of the three parameters are also known .",
    "we consider the following cases .",
    "case 1 : when the unknown parameter appears in the evolution of @xmath62 :    here assuming @xmath63 to be the unknown parameter , we create a receiver system as described in the section i , given by , @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the new state variables and @xmath66 are the parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath68 being the same as those in the transmitter while @xmath69 is initially set to an arbitrary value . @xmath20 is the the feedback constant .",
    "these constitute the receiver system .",
    "@xmath70 is the _ drive _ variable .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 , which is initially set to an arbitrary value , is made to evolve through an equation similar the equation ( eq .  ( [ adaptation ] ) ) .",
    "here we can use only the @xmath71 of the last factor in eq .",
    "( [ adaptation ] ) since there is a single equation involving parameter evolution .",
    "@xmath72 this equation along with the receiver system ( eq .",
    "( [ lorenz2 ] ) ) , can achieve required synchronization as well as parameter estimation since , a randomly chosen initial vector @xmath65 evolves to @xmath60 and @xmath73 as time @xmath74 .",
    "figure  1 displays the manner in which the synchronization takes place and how the parameter @xmath69 , initially set to an arbitrary value finally evolves towards the precise `` unknown '' value @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) we show the differences @xmath75 as functions of time and we observe that they eventually settle down to zero after an initial transient . in fig .",
    "1(d ) we plot @xmath76 as a function of time which also goes to zero simultaneously .",
    "the synchronization as shown in fig .",
    "1 occurs when conditional lyapunov exponents for the receiver system coupled to the parameter evolution are all negative or at most zero .",
    "this restricts the suitable choices for @xmath20 and @xmath29 .",
    "the jacobian matrix @xmath55 , for the evolution of the vector @xmath77 is given by ( eq .  ( [ linflow ] ) ) , @xmath78    figure  2 shows the curve along which the largest cle becomes zero , in the @xmath79 plane .",
    "in region i , all nontrivial cle s are negative and the method works convergently , while in region ii , the largest cle becomes positive and no convergence takes place .",
    "nevertheless note that for any positive value of @xmath29 , there can always be a suitably chosen @xmath20 such that the convergence occurs . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a critical value of @xmath20 below which the method does not work .",
    "case 2 a : when the unknown parameter appears in the evolution of @xmath80 variable :    here , we consider the case of @xmath67 as the unknown parameter ( [ lorenz1 ] ) and reconstruct the receiver as , @xmath81 while the evolution of @xmath82 takes the form , ( eqs .",

    "the slope of the line in fig .",
    "6 corresponds to the lyapunov exponent .",
    "it was compared with the lyapunov exponent computed using a numerical algorithm and a fair agreement was observed .",
    "case 2 b : when the unknown parameter appears in the evolution of @xmath90 variable :    the case where the parameter @xmath68 appearing in the evolution of @xmath90 , ( eq .",

    "finally we note that in all the three cases discussed above , since the time series for @xmath62 in eq .",

    "( [ lorenz1 ] ) is given as an input . here",
    "@xmath98 can be chosen as a drive variable which drives the evolution of the remaining variables as well as the unknown parameter .",
    "thus it is possible to know an unknown value of any of the parameters of the lorenz system from a single time series for @xmath62 or @xmath80 .      here",
    "we will consider the estimation of two or three parameters for the lorenz system ( [ lorenz1 ] ) .",
    "we have applied our method for estimation of two parameters of the lorenz system ( [ lorenz1 ] ) , taking @xmath62 or @xmath80 as drive variables .",

    "we have however found that the convergence is not possible for @xmath62 or @xmath90 as the drive variables .",
    "finally , we have also applied our method to estimate two or three parameters of the rossler system with @xmath80 as a drive variable .",
    "it was seen that no choice of the feedback constant and the stiffness constant lead to convergences required for estimation .      as our final example , we present a set of nonlinear equations appearing in plasma physics .",
    "this is the so called resonant three - wave coupling equations when high frequency wave is unstable and the remaining two are damped  @xcite .",

    ", the differences go to zero asymptotically .",
    "in this section we will study the effect of noise present in the transmitter system .",
    "we will take the example of the lorenz system ( eq .",
    "( [ lorenz1 ] ) for this purpose , where @xmath63 is assumed to be the unknown parameter and @xmath62 acts as a drive variable .",
    "assuming that there is a small additive noise present in the time series given for @xmath62 , we feed the noisy time series into the receiver system ( eq .",
    "( [ lorenz2 ] ) and carry out the parameter estimation as described .",
    "we find that for weak noise , the asymptotically estimated value of the parameter fluctuates around the correct value with a small amplitude .",
    "thus the estimation is possible using our method .",
    "the error in the estimation can be reduced by a suitable averaging over the time evolution of @xmath69 in the asymptotic limit . for increasing strengths of noise , the fluctuations in the estimated value",
    "grow larger and precise estimation becomes difficult . figure  11 shows the convergence of @xmath69 to @xmath63 when additive noise is present in the evolution of @xmath62 , the drive variable of the lorenz system , for which the time series is given .",
    "we define the accuracy ( @xmath116 ) in the estimation of @xmath63 as @xmath117 while @xmath118 denotes the strength of noise with uniform distribution ranging from @xmath119 to @xmath118 . in fig.12",
    "we plot the asymptotic value of a , the accuracy of the estimation of @xmath63 , against the strength @xmath118 of noise in @xmath62 .",
    "it can be seen from the curve that the accuracy grows linearly as the noise increases to a value of @xmath120 which corresponds to about 12% of the range of @xmath62 values .",
    "the plot thus shows that our method is quite robust for weak noise in @xmath62 , while it can fail as the noise strength increases to a larger value .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that a combination of synchronization based on linear feedback given into only a single receiver variable with an _ adaptive _ evolution for parameters unknown to the receiver , enables the estimation of the unknown parameters .",
    "the feedback comes from a scalar time series .",
    "we have also shown that our procedure corresponds to dynamic minimization of the synchronization error .",
    "we have presented examples of lorenz and rssler systems taking different candidate parameters to be unknown to the receiver as well as that of a plasma system obeying resonant three - wave coupling equation . in the lorenz system ( eq .",
    "( [ lorenz1 ] ) ) , any of the three parameters can be estimated when a time series is given for either of @xmath62 and @xmath80 , but the method fails when the known time series is for the variable @xmath90 .",
    "extensions to estimation of more than one parameters of the lorenz system are also presented as a representative case .",
    "estimation of two parameters is possible for both @xmath62 or @xmath80 as drive variables while estimation of all the three parameters is possible only when time series for @xmath80 is given .    in the case of rssler system ( eq .",
    "( [ rossler1 ] ) ) the method works only when the time series is given for the variable @xmath80 where it is possible to estimate any of the three parameters .",
    "we find that in case of the plasma system , the parameters can be estimated with the feedback in the evolution for either @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "we have thus numerically demonstrated that the explicit detailed information about the parameters of a nonlinear chaotic system is contained in the time series data of a variable and can be extracted under suitable conditions .",
