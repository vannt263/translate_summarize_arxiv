    "the acousto - optic effect refers to the scattering of light from a medium whose optical properties are modulated by an acoustic wave .",
    "brillouin scattering from density fluctuations in a fluid  @xcite and the ultrasonic modulation of multiply - scattered light  @xcite are familiar examples of this effect .",
    "it is well known that the scattered optical field carries information about the medium .",
    "this principle has been exploited to develop an imaging modality , known as acousto - optic imaging , which combines the spectroscopic sensitivity of optical methods with the spatial resolution of ultrasonic imaging .",
    "two forms of acousto - optic imaging are usually distinguished .",
    "direct imaging employs a focused ultrasound beam for image formation  @xcite .",
    "the image is created by scanning the focus of the beam and recording the intensity of the scattered light at a fixed detector .",
    "tomographic imaging utilizes an inverse scattering method to reconstruct images of the optical properties of the medium  @xcite .",
    "the theory of the acousto - optic effect begins with a model for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a material medium .",
    "the most general such model is based on the maxwell equations for a dielectric whose permittivity is modulated by an acoustic wave  @xcite . alternatively , for multiply - scattered light , a phenomenological theory based on the radiative transport equation ( rte ) or the diffusion approximation ( da ) to the rte may be employed  @xcite . in this paper , we develop a _ first - principles _ theory of the acousto - optic effect .",
    "we begin by constructing a model for the acoustic modulation of the dielectric permittivity of a medium consisting of small scatterers suspended in a fluid .",
    "next , we consider the propagation of light in the medium and obtain the wave equations obeyed by the frequency components of the optical field at harmonics of the acoustic frequency .",
    "we then obtain the corresponding rte by asymptotic analysis of the wigner transform of the field in a random medium .",
    "we note that the problem is challenging because the random medium acquires a time - dependence due to the presence of the acoustic field .",
    "we apply our results to estimating the minimum detectable size of a small inhomogeneity in acousto - optic imaging .",

    "in this section we develop a simple model for the acousto - optic effect .",
    "the setup we consider is illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "we begin by considering a medium consisting of identical neutrally - buoyant spherical particles suspended in a fluid .",
    "we suppose that an acoustic wave propagates in the fluid , the effect of which is to cause the particles to move under the associated radiation force .",
    "if the amplitude of the acoustic wave is sufficiently small , the particles will oscillate about their equilibrium positions .",
    "it is then possible to treat the motion of each particle as independent , neglecting hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "it follows that the equation of motion of a single particle is of the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 denotes the velocity of the particle , @xmath2 is the pressure , @xmath3 is the velocity field in the fluid , @xmath4 is the viscosity , @xmath5 is the radius of the particle , @xmath6 is its mass density and @xmath7 . consider a standing time - harmonic acoustic wave with pressure @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the amplitude of the wave , @xmath10 is its frequency and @xmath11 is the wave vector . here",
    "we have assumed that the speed of sound @xmath12 is constant with @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding velocity field is given by @xmath14 thus apart from a transient , the particle moves with the fluid .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the positions of the particles and @xmath16 their density .",
    "since each particle is independent , it follows from integration of the equations of motion ( [ eq_motion ] ) that @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the number density of the particles in the absence of the acoustic wave and @xmath20 is a small parameter . note that taking @xmath21 is consistent with the neglect of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "we conclude that the number density of particles is modulated by the acoustic wave .",
    "next , we turn to the propagation of light in the medium . for simplicity , we ignore the effects of polarization and employ a scalar theory of the optical field . the field @xmath22 is taken to obey the wave equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dielectric permittivity of the medium and @xmath25 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the permittivity is of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the permittivity of the fluid and @xmath4 is the dielectric susceptibility of the particles .",

    "in addition , we suppose that the particles are small in size in comparison to the wavelength of light .",
