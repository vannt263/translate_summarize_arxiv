    "the analytical study of magnetization dynamics governed by the landau - lifshitz equation ( see [ 18 ] ) has been the focus of considerable research for many years . in normalized form",
    "this equation reads as ( see [ 5 ] , equations ( 2.51 ) and ( 2.53 ) ) :    @xmath1    here @xmath2 is an effective field .",
    "the three - dimensional vector @xmath3 is the magnetization of the material at a fixed point @xmath4 at time @xmath5 ; the term @xmath6 is the landau - lifshitz damping term , @xmath7 .",
    "one can check that ( 1.1 ) preserves a first integral @xmath8 .",
    "therefore for fixed @xmath9 , the system ( 1.1 ) describes a motion on the sphere in @xmath0 .",
    "one can introduce an energy density function @xmath10 such that @xmath11 . then equation ( 1.1 )",
    "can be written as follows :    @xmath12    we assume that @xmath10 is a smooth generic function . considered on the unit sphere @xmath13 in @xmath0 , such a function may have three types of critical points : maxima , minima and saddle points . without the damping @xmath14 the energy density @xmath10 is preserved .",
    "one easily checks that @xmath15 so that the damping term is a kind of `` friction '' for the system ( 1.2 ) , just like the classical friction in hamiltonian systems ( compare with [ 4 ] ) .    if @xmath7 , the dynamics of ( 1.2 ) has two distinct time scales : the fast time scale of the precessional dynamics and the relatively slow time scale of relaxational dynamics caused by the small damping term @xmath16",
    "therefore it is natural to use the averaging principle to describe the long - time evolution of energy density @xmath10 .",
    "however the classical averaging principle here should be modified : existence of saddle points of @xmath17 on the sphere @xmath18 leads to stochastic , in a certain sense , behavior of the slow motion even in the case of purely deterministic damping term ( compare with [ 4 ] ) . moreover , in section 5 , we consider a more general class of equations , where level set components of first integrals , which are compact two - dimensional surfaces may have topological structure different from a sphere .",
    "if genus of such a surface is positive , the non - perturbed system can have positive area ergodic sets .",
    "existence of such sets lead to an `` additional stochasticity '' .",
    "description of the stochastic process which characterizes the long - time evolution of the energy is one of the main goals of this paper .",
    "random perturbation caused by thermal fluctuations become increasingly pronounced in nano - scale devices . to take this into account",
    "one can include in the right - hand side of ( 1.2 ) a small stochastic term .",
    "this stochastic term , in general , introduces one more time scale in the system .",
    "interplay between the influence of small damping and even smaller stochastic term leads to certain changes in the metastability of the system .",
    "description of the metastable distributions is another goal of this paper .",
    "there are some other asymptotic regimes of the landau - lifshitz dynamics which we mention briefly and we will consider them in more details elsewhere .",
    "in this section we give an informal sketch of the results .    in the next two sections we consider perturbations of the following equation    @xmath19 which could be regarded as a generalized landau - lifshitz equation .    here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , are smooth enough generic functions ( this means that each of these functions has a finite number of critical points which are assumed to be non - degenerate ) , @xmath23 .",
    "the initial point @xmath24 is chosen in such a way that @xmath25 .",
    "as before we call @xmath20 energy ( to be precise , @xmath20 in ( 1.2 ) is the energy density but for brevity we call it energy ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath21 and @xmath20 are first integrals of system ( 2.1 ) .",
    "for instance ,    @xmath26    note also that the lebesgue measure in @xmath0 ( the volume ) is invariant for system ( 2.1 ) : @xmath27 this implies , in particular , that @xmath28 is the density of an invariant measure of system ( 2.1 ) considered on the surface @xmath29 with respect to the area on @xmath30 .",
    "notice that the surface @xmath30 may have several connected components . for brevity in the next two sections , and in the rest of this section ( except the last four paragraph )",
    ", we assume that the level surface @xmath29 has only one connected component and this component is homeomorphic to @xmath13 . in sections 5 and 6",
    "we will drop this assumption and consider more general situations .",
    "as we already mentioned , the damping term in ( 1.2 ) preserves the first integral @xmath31 , so that we consider , first , perturbations of ( 2.1 ) preserving @xmath21 .",
    "the perturbed equation can be written in the form    @xmath32    here @xmath33 is a smooth vector field in @xmath0 . in the next two sections we assume for brevity that the perturbation @xmath34 is of `` friction '' type : @xmath35    note that any vector field @xmath36 can be written in the form @xmath37 for some vector field @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , without loss of generality one can assume that @xmath39 .",
    "each such vector @xmath40 can be represented as @xmath41 . so that the perturbed equation can be written as    @xmath42    furthermore , using the identity",

    "we get from ( 2.2 ) that    @xmath90    therefore the fast motion is defined by the vector field @xmath91 , and the slow motion is due to @xmath92 ( we will sometimes ignore the arguments since they could be directly understood from the context ) . in order to study the limiting behavior of the process @xmath85 , we introduce a graph @xmath93 ( compare with [ 14 , chapter 8 ] ) .",
    "the graph @xmath93 is constructed in the following way .",
    "let us identify the points of each connected component of the level sets of @xmath10 on @xmath60 .",

    "a point @xmath101 can be characterized by two coordinates @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the value of function @xmath10 at @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the number of the edge of the graph @xmath93 to which @xmath106 belongs .",
    "notice that @xmath107 is not chosen in a unique way since for @xmath108 the value of @xmath107 can be either @xmath109 , @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",

    "the slow component of @xmath85 is the projection of @xmath85 on @xmath93 : @xmath118 . using the classical averaging principle",
    "one can describe the limiting motion of @xmath119 as @xmath120 inside the edges .",
    "but it turns out that the trajectory @xmath119 , when hitting the interior vertex @xmath68 on @xmath93 , is very sensitive to @xmath121 .",
    "this means that @xmath118 , @xmath122 , hits @xmath68 in a finite time @xmath123 such that @xmath124 exists and finite , and after that alternatively as @xmath120 goes to @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "the limit of @xmath119 as @xmath120 for @xmath125 does not exist ( compare with [ 4 ] ) . in order to describe the limiting behavior",
    ", we have to regularize the problem .",
    "to this end one can add a small stochastic perturbation of order @xmath126 either to the initial condition or to the equation .",

    "since small random perturbations , as a rule , are available in the system , exactly this weak limit characterizes the behavior of @xmath131 as @xmath132 .",
    "we will introduce different types of regularization and prove that all these regularizations lead to the same limiting stochastic process @xmath129 on @xmath93 , which we calculate .",
    "the proofs , in section 3 and , partly , in section 4 , are similar to the case of perturbations of hamiltonian systems ( [ 14 , chapter 8 ] , [ 4 ] ) , and we pay most of the attention to the arguments which are not presented in these works . for instance , in the case of regularization by a random perturbation of the initial point , bounds for the hitting time of the homoclinic trajectory are considered in details .",
    "so far we considered just deterministic perturbations preserving the first integral @xmath48 .",
    "stochastic perturbations were used just for regularization of the problem .",
    "one can consider also white - noise - type perturbations preserving @xmath48 of the same or of a larger order than deterministic perturbations .",
    "then , in an appropriate time scale , the limiting slow motion converges to a diffusion process on a graph ( section 4 ) . in general , deterministic and stochastic perturbations",
    "have different order , so that , after time rescaling @xmath133 , the perturbed equation has the form    @xmath134    here @xmath135 is the standard gaussian white noise , @xmath136 is a smooth matrix - function such that @xmath137 .",

    "the slow component is again the projection @xmath127 of @xmath86 on the graph @xmath93 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath146 and assume that the deterministic perturbation is friction - like .",
    "if @xmath147 is small enough and @xmath148 , the system @xmath149 , @xmath150 , has three critical points @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 of the same type as the corresponding points @xmath154 .",

    "but if @xmath121 tends to zero , the situation is different : @xmath160 , @xmath161 , converges to a random variable distributed between @xmath69 and @xmath70 as @xmath146 .",
    "the set of possible distributions between the minima is finite and is independent of the stochastic part of perturbations . but which of these distributions is realized at a time @xmath162 depends on @xmath163 and @xmath164 , as well as on stochastic perturbations .",
    "we describe these metastable distributions in section 4 .",
    "perturbations of a more general equation than ( 2.1 ) are considered in section 5 .",
    "the non - perturbed motion in this case , in general , has just one smooth first integral and the averaging procedure essentially depends on the topological structure of the connected components of level sets of the existing first integral .",
