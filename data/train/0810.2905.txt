    "since pioneering work  @xcite in the field , the standard approach for baryon spectroscopy is the constituent quark model .",

    "for @xmath97 we retain its dominant contribution @xmath100 to order @xmath101 .",

    "it is measured in units of the chiral symmetry breaking scale parameter @xmath108 gev .",
    "the quark model used here to describe baryons aims at capturing the main physical features of a three - quark system while keeping the formalism as simple as possible in order to get analytical mass formulas .",
    "it contains : relativistic kinetic energy for the quarks , @xmath109-junction confining potential , one - gluon exchange potential and quark self - energy contribution added as perturbative terms .",
    "let us now shortly describe all these ingredients .",
    "a baryon , seen as a bound state of three valence quarks , can be described , at the dominant order , by the spinless salpeter hamiltonian @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the bare mass of the quark @xmath26 and where @xmath112 is the confining interaction potential .",
    "we use the bare mass of the quarks in the relativistic kinetic energy term as suggested by the field correlator method  @xcite , but other approaches , like coulomb gauge qcd , rather favor a running constituent quark mass  @xcite .",
    "although very interesting conceptually , the influence of this choice on the mass spectra should not be so dramatic than it could have been expected at the first glance : first , the bare and constituent heavy quark masses are nearly identical .",
    "second , the constituent light quark masses quickly decrease at large momentum and become similar to the bare masses ; a common limit is reached for the excited states .",
    "the situation is thus mainly different for low - lying @xmath113 baryons ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 quarks are commonly denoted as @xmath27 ) , where the bare mass @xmath116 can be set equal to 0 , but where the constituent mass is about 300  mev  @xcite .",
    "however , the strength of additional interactions like one - gluon exchange ( see next section ) can be tuned in both cases and lead to final mass spectra which are quite similar .    both the flux tube model @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite support the y - junction picture for the confining potential : a flux tube starts from each quark and the three tubes meet at the torricelli ( or steiner or fermat ) point of the triangle formed by the three quarks , let us say the @xmath117 triangle .",
    "this point @xmath118 , located at @xmath119 , minimizes the sum of the flux tube lengths and leads to the following confining potential @xmath120 , where the position of quark @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath121 and where @xmath122 is the energy density of the flux tubes . if all the angles of @xmath117 are less than 120@xmath123 , then the toricelli point is such that the angles @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 are all equal to 120@xmath123 .",
    "if the angle corresponding to an apex is greater than 120@xmath123 , the toricelli point is precisely at this apex .",
    "as @xmath127 is a complicated three - body function , it is interesting to approximate the confining potential by a more tractable form . in the following , we shall use @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the position of the center of mass and @xmath24 is a corrective factor @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the replacement  ( [ pot1 ] ) has been checked to be very satisfactory ( better than 5% ) in this last reference provided that the appropriate scaling factor is used : @xmath130 for @xmath131 baryons and @xmath132 for @xmath74 baryons . for highly excited states ,",
    "the contribution of the configurations in which the toricelli point is located on one of the quarks becomes more and more important , and one could think that the center of mass approximation  ( [ pot1 ] ) is then wrong .",
    "but in such cases the angle made by the toricelli point and the other two quarks is larger than @xmath133 and the center of mass is consequently still close to the true toricelli point . the approximation  ( [ pot1 ] ) , although being less accurate for highly excited states , remains however relevant .",
    "besides the hamiltonian ( [ ssh2 ] ) , other contributions are necessary to reproduce the baryon masses .",
    "we shall add them as perturbations to the dominant hamiltonian  ( [ ssh2 ] ) .",
    "the most widespread correction is a coulomb interaction term of the form @xmath134 arising from one - gluon exchange processes , where @xmath135 is the strong coupling constant between the quarks @xmath26 and @xmath136 .",
    "actually , one should deal with a running form @xmath137 , but it would considerably increase the difficulty of the computations . typically , we need two values : @xmath138 for a @xmath139 pair and @xmath140 for a @xmath141 pair , in the spirit of what has been done in a previous study describing mesons in the relativistic flux tube model @xcite . there",
    "it was found that @xmath142 describes rather well the experimental data of @xmath143 and @xmath144 mesons .",
    "another perturbative contribution to the mass is the quark self - energy .",
    "this is due to the color magnetic moment of a quark propagating through the qcd vacuum .",
    "it adds a negative contribution to the hadron masses @xcite . the quark self - energy contribution for a baryon",
    "is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the kinetic energy of the quark @xmath26 , that is @xmath147 , the average being computed with the wave function of the unperturbed spinless salpeter hamiltonian  ( [ ssh2 ] ) .",
    "the factors @xmath148 and @xmath149 have been computed in quenched and unquenched lattice qcd studies ; it seems well established that @xmath150 and ( @xmath151 )  gev @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath152 is analytically known ; we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit formula .",
    "it can accurately be fitted by @xmath153 let us note that the corrections depending on the parameter @xmath154 appear at order @xmath155 in the mass formula , so they are not considered in this work .",
    "we finally point out that the quark model we developed in this section is spin independent .",
    "this neglect of the fermionic nature of the quarks is the reason why such a model is often called",
    " semirelativistic \" : the implicit covariance is preserved , but spin effects are absent .",
    "spin dependent contributions ( spin - spin , spin - orbit , etc . ) typically come from relativistic corrections to the one - gluon exchange potential .",
    "it is useful to mention that in our formalism such potential terms between the quarks @xmath26 and @xmath136 should be of the form  @xcite @xmath156",
    "the comparison between the quark model and large @xmath1 mass formulas would be more straightforward if we could obtain analytical expressions .",
    "to this aim , the auxiliary field method is used in order to transform the hamiltonian  ( [ ssh2 ] ) into an analytically solvable one @xcite . with @xmath157",

    "the equivalence relation between hamiltonians  ( [ ssh2 ] ) and ( [ ham3b ] ) is @xmath165 .",
    "although the auxiliary fields are operators , the calculations are considerably simplified if one considers them as variational parameters .",
    "they have then to be eliminated by a minimization of the masses , and their extremal values @xmath166 and @xmath167 are logically close to @xmath163 and @xmath168 respectively @xcite",
    ". this technique can give approximate results very close to the exact ones  @xcite . if the auxiliary fields are assumed to be real numbers , the hamiltonian  ( [ ham3b ] ) reduces formally to a nonrelativistic three - body harmonic oscillator , for which analytical solutions can be found . a first step",
    "is to replace the quark coordinates @xmath169 by the jacobi coordinates @xmath170 defined as  @xcite @xmath171 and @xmath172 .    in the case of two quarks with mass @xmath104 and another with mass @xmath173",

    "moreover , @xmath183 and @xmath184 are analytically known .",
    "this eventually allows to compute @xmath185 and @xmath186 , which are needed to know the one - gluon exchange contribution .",
    "the four auxiliary fields appearing in the mass formula  ( [ mass1 ] ) have to be eliminated by solving simultaneously the four constraints @xmath187 this task can not be analytically performed in general , but solutions can fortunately be found in the case of light and heavy baryons .",

    "important simplifications occur by setting @xmath191 , which is a good approximation of the @xmath114 and @xmath115 quark bare masses . however , the non vanishing value for @xmath192 causes eqs .",
    "( [ const ] ) to have no analytical solution unless a power expansion in @xmath192 is performed .",
    "this is justified _ a priori _ since the strange quark is still a light one .",

    "indeed the spinless salpeter hamiltonian  ( [ ssh2 ] ) has been transformed into a harmonic oscillator by the auxiliary field method and it is thus natural that a such band number appears .",

    "it is also possible to reach the same conclusion by checking that an excitation of type @xmath199 will keep the baryon smaller in average than the corresponding excitation in @xmath200 .",
    "this is favored because of the particular shape of the potential , having for consequence that the more the system is small , the more it is light .    as for light baryons , the quark model shows that heavy baryons can be labeled by a single band number @xmath5 in a harmonic oscillator picture . a light diquark - heavy quark structure",

    "what can be it done to remove this problem is to rescale @xmath122 .",

    ". the scaling @xmath213 will consequently be assumed in the rest of this paper .",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 appearing in the @xmath0 mass operator can be obtained from a fit to experimental data .",
    "for example , the case @xmath14 is particularly simple . equation  ( [ gs ] ) can be applied to @xmath5 and @xmath57 baryons .",
    "taking @xmath214 together with @xmath215  mev for @xmath216 , and @xmath217  mev for @xmath218 , we get @xmath219 since the spin - orbit contribution vanishes for @xmath14 , no information can be obtained for @xmath89 .",

    "no data is available for @xmath226 in large @xmath1 studies .",
    "the large @xmath1 data are nearly indistinguishable from the quark model prediction in the left plot.,width=604 ]    in the @xmath0 expansion method , the dominant term @xmath227 in the mass formula  ( [ massoperator ] ) contains the spin - independent contribution to the baryon mass , which in a quark model language represents the confinement and the kinetic energy .",
    "so , it is natural to identify this term with the mass given by the formula  ( [ m_qqq ] ) .",

    "therefore we expect the dependence of @xmath5 of these coefficients to be of the form @xmath232 we see that such a behavior is consistent with the large @xmath1 results in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we chose @xmath233  mev so that the point with @xmath234 , for which the uncertainty is minimal , is exactly reproduced .",
    "let us recall that the spin - orbit term is vanishing for @xmath14 , so no large @xmath1 result is available in this case . to compute the parameter @xmath235 a fit was performed on all the large @xmath1 results .",
    "in this way we have obtained @xmath236  mev .",
    "note that @xmath237 .",
    "this shows that the spin - spin contribution is much larger than the spin - orbit contribution , which justifies the neglect of the spin - orbit one in quark model studies .",
    "we have first to find out the values of @xmath64 coming from the @xmath0 expansion . for @xmath43 , 1 , and 3",
    ", they can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the case @xmath238 is available in ref .",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated in the @xmath239 band due to a larger number of available results .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion about the computation of @xmath64 in this case .",
    "the mass shift due to strange quarks is given in the quark model formalism by @xmath240 in eq .",
    "( [ m_qqq ] ) . a comparison of this term with its large @xmath1 counterpart",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we used the same parameters as for light nonstrange baryons .",
    "the only new parameter is the strange quark mass , that we set equal to @xmath241  mev , a higher mass than the pdg value but rather common in quark model studies .",
    "one can see that the quark model predictions are always located within the error bars of the large @xmath1 results . except for @xmath242 ,",
    "whose large @xmath1 value would actually require further investigations , the central values of @xmath64 in the large @xmath1 approach are close to the quark model results and they decrease slowly and monotonously with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "thus , in both approaches , one predicts a mass correction term due to su(3)-flavor breaking which decreases with the excitation energy ( or @xmath5 ) .      as mentioned previously ,",
    "our present study is restricted to ground state heavy baryons made of one heavy and two light quarks . in the @xmath0 , @xmath73 expansion the parameters to be fitted are @xmath93 , @xmath78 and @xmath243 . at the dominant order",
    ", the value of @xmath93 can be extracted from the mass combinations  @xcite @xmath244 resulting from the mass formula ( [ mlnc ] ) .",
    "here and below the particle label represents its mass .",
    "a slightly more complicated mass combination , involving light baryons as well as heavy ones , directly leads to @xmath78 , that is @xcite @xmath245= m_q.\\ ] ] this mass combination gives    [ paramlnc ] @xmath246 while the value @xmath247    ensures that the mass combinations  ( [ mcomb ] ) are optimally compatible with the experimental values for @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "a measure of the su(3)-flavor breaking factor is given by @xcite @xmath250 the value @xmath251  mev leads to @xmath252  mev , which is the average value of the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the new parameters appearing in the quark model are @xmath253 , @xmath254 , @xmath132 , and @xmath255 . for the other parameters we keep the values fitted in the light baryon sector .",
    "we take @xmath256 from the quark model study of ref .",
    "the heavy quark masses can be fitted to the experimental data as follows .",
    "the quark model mass formula  ( [ m_qqq ] ) is spin independent ; it should thus be suitable to reproduce the masses of heavy baryons for which @xmath257 .",
    "namely , one expects that @xmath258 these values are reproduced by formula  ( [ m_qqq ] ) with @xmath259  gev and @xmath260  gev .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we predict @xmath261  mev and @xmath262  mev with these parameters .",
    "these values are very close to the experimental @xmath263 and @xmath264 masses respectively .",
    "we can now compare the quark model and the @xmath0 , @xmath73 mass formulas .",
    "on the one hand the mass combination  ( [ e0 ] ) leads to @xmath265  mev and @xmath266  mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the quark model mass formula  ( [ m_qqq ] ) is compatible with the experimental data provided that @xmath267  mev and @xmath268  mev .",
    "both approaches lead to quark masses that differ by less than 5% .",
    "thus they agree at the dominant order , where only @xmath78 is present .",
    "the other parameter involved in the large @xmath1 mass formula is @xmath93 .",
    "a comparison of the spin independent part of the mass formulas ( [ mlnc ] ) and ( [ m_qqq ] ) leads to the following identification for @xmath214 @xmath269 according to eqs .",
    "( [ largenpar ] ) and ( [ lambdadef ] ) one has @xmath270  gev .",
    "the quark model gives 0.333  gev for the expression after the second equality sign in eq .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) , which means a very good agreement for the qcd scale @xmath93 .",
    "the terms of order @xmath73 lead to the identity @xmath271 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that to test this relation the value of @xmath78 is not needed , like for the identity  ( [ rel1 ] ) .",
    "the large @xmath1 parameter , @xmath272  gev , gives for the left hand side of ( [ rel2 ] ) @xmath273  gev@xmath222 and the quark model gives for the right hand side 0.091 gev@xmath222 , which is again a good agreement .",
    "finally , the su(3)-flavor breaking term is proportional to @xmath274 in the mass formula ( [ breaksim ] )",
    ". equations  ( [ breaksim ] ) , ( [ m_qqq ] ) , and ( [ breakh ] ) lead to @xmath275.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the large @xmath1 value @xmath276  gev and the quark model estimate @xmath277  gev also compare satisfactorily .",
    "we point out that , except for @xmath253 and @xmath254 , all the model parameters are determined from theoretical arguments combined with phenomenology , or are fitted on light baryon masses .",
    "the comparison of our results with the @xmath0 expansion coefficients @xmath88 , @xmath90 and @xmath243 are independent of the @xmath78 values .",
    "so we can say that this analysis is parameter free .",
    "an evaluation of the coefficients @xmath89 , @xmath278 , and @xmath279 through a computation of the spin dependent effects is out of the scope of the present approach .",
    "but at the dominant order , one expects from eq .",
    "( [ vsd ] ) that @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "the ratio @xmath282 should thus be of order @xmath283  mev , which is roughly in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ largenpar ] ) stating that @xmath284 .",
    "this gives an indication that the quark model and the @xmath0 expansion method would remain compatible if the spin - dependent effects were included .",
    "we have established a connection between the quark model and the @xmath0 expansion both for light baryons and for heavy baryons containing a heavy quark . in the latter case the @xmath0 expansion is supplemented by an @xmath73 expansion due to the heavy quark . a clear correspondence between the various terms appearing in the @xmath0 and quark model mass formulas is observed , and the fitted coefficients of the @xmath0 mass formulas can be quantitatively reproduced by the quark model .    these results bring reliable qcd - based support in favor of the constituent quark model assumptions and lead to a better insight into the coefficients @xmath20 encoding the qcd dynamics in the @xmath0 mass operator . in particular , the dynamical origin of the band number labeling the baryons in large @xmath1 qcd",
    "is explained by the quark model .    as an outlook , we mention two important studies that we hope to make in the future .",
    "first , the @xmath234 baryons of @xmath74 type are poorly known in the @xmath0 , @xmath73 expansion .",
    "they should be reconsidered and compared to the quark model .",
    "second , the ground state baryons made of two heavy quarks and a light quark could be studied in a combined @xmath0 , @xmath73 expansion - quark model approach , leading to predictions for the mass spectrum of these baryons .",
