    "<S> functional renormalisation group approach is applied to a imbalanced many - fermion system with a short - range attractive force . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a composite boson field to describe pairing effects , and assume a simple ansatz for the effective action . </S>",
    "<S> a set of approximate flow equations for the effective coupling including boson and fermionic fluctuations is derived and solved . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the critical values of particle number density mismatch when the system undergoes to a normal state . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the phase diagram both at unitarity and around . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained phase diagram is in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of pairing in imbalanced many - fermion systems is nowdays a subject of the intensive theoretical and experimental studies ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for review ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomena occurs in many physical systems from molecular physics to quark matter at finite density . </S>",
    "<S> being different in details , the underlying dynamical mechanisms share a common feature related to cooper instability leading to a rearrangement of the ground state and associated spontaneous symmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we focus on the asymmetric ultracold atomic fermi mixture of two fermion flavours , which realizes a highly tunable system of strongly interacting fermions . </S>",
    "<S> this tunability is provided by a feshbach resonance , which allows to control the interaction strength between two different species of fermions and explore the bec - bcs crossover in a wide range of physical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> another tunable parameter ( in asymmetric systems ) is the population imbalance which can be used to probe how stable the superfluid phase is . </S>",
    "<S> the problem was studied long time ago by clogston and chandrasekhar @xcite who found that in the bcs limit the system with the chemical potential mismatch @xmath0 undergoes first order phase transition to a normal phase at @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the gap at zero temperature for balanced system . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the issue has been looked at again but now in the case of strongly interacting fermions with infinite scattering length ( unitary limit ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most theoretical studies have been performed in the framework of the mean - field ( mf ) type of approaches which are of limited use for the imbalanced many - fermion systems and may not be reliable in providing quantitative answers . in many cases </S>",
    "<S> the effects of quantum fluctuations turn out to be important .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present paper is to set up a framework to study pairing phenomena in imbalanced many - fermion systems using the formalism of functional renormalisation group @xcite ( frg ) where the effects of quantum fluctuations are included in a consistent and reliable way . </S>",
    "<S> the frg approach makes use of the legendre transformed effective action : @xmath3=w[j]-j\\cdot \\phi_c$ ] , where @xmath4 is the usual partition function in the presence of an external source @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the action functional @xmath6 generates the 1pi green s functions and it reduces to the effective potential for homogeneous systems . in the frg </S>",
    "<S> one introduces an artificial renormalisation group flow , generated by a momentum scale @xmath7 and we define the effective action by integrating over components of the fields with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the rg trajectory then interpolates between the classical action of the underlying field theory ( at large @xmath7 ) , and the full effective action ( at @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method has been successfully applied to a range of problems , from condensed matter physics @xcite to particle physics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equation for @xmath6 in the erg has a one - loop structure and can be written as @xmath10 + \\frac{i}{2}\\,\\operatorname{tr}\\left [ ( { \\boldsymbol \\gamma}^{(2)}_{ff}-{\\mathbf r}_f)^{-1}\\,\\partial_k{\\mathbf r}_f\\right ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : gamevol}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is the matrix containing second functional derivatives of the effective action with respect to the fermion ( boson ) fields and @xmath12 is a matrix containing the corresponding boson ( fermion ) regulators which must vanish when the running scale approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath13 matrix structure arises for the bosons because we treat @xmath14 and @xmath15 as independent fields in order to include the number - violating condensate . </S>",
    "<S> a similar structure also appears for the fermions . by inserting the ansatz for @xmath6 into this equation </S>",
    "<S> one can turn it into a set of coupled equations for the various couplings .    here </S>",
    "<S> we study a system of fermions with population imbalancies interacting through an attractive two - body point - like potential and consider pairing between the fermions with different flavours assuming that the interaction between the identical ones is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we take as our starting point an eft that describes the @xmath16-wave scattering of two nonidentical fermions with a @xmath17-matrix determined by the scattering length @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> a positive scattering length corresponds to a system with a two - body bound state ( and hence repulsive phase - shifts for low - energy scattering ) whereas a negative scattering length corresponds to one without a bound state . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy gets deeper as @xmath18 gets smaller , while the limit @xmath19 is related to a zero - energy bound state .    </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested in the appearance of a gap in the fermion spectrum , we need to parametrise our effective action in a way that can describe the qualitative change in the physics when this occurs . a natural way to do this is to introduce a boson field whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) describes the gap and so acts as the corresponding order parameter . at the start of the rg flow , </S>",
    "<S> the boson field is not dynamical and is introduced through a hubbard - stratonovich transformation of the four - fermion pointlike interaction . as we integrate out more and more of the fermion degrees of freedom by running @xmath7 to lower values , we generate dynamical terms in the bosonic effective action .    </S>",
    "<S> we take the following ansatz for @xmath6 which is a generalisation of the ansatz used in @xcite for a balanced many - fermion system @xmath20&=&\\int d^4x\\ , \\left[\\phi^\\dagger(x)\\left(z_\\phi\\ , i \\partial_t   + \\frac{z_m}{2m}\\,\\nabla^2\\right)\\phi(x)-u(\\phi,\\phi^\\dagger)\\nonumber\\right.\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad+ \\sum_{i=1}^{i=2}\\psi^\\dagger\\left ( z_\\psi ( i \\partial_t+\\mu_i ) + \\frac{z_{m_i}}{2m_i}\\,\\nabla^2\\right)\\psi\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\left.- g\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\,\\psi^{\\rm t}\\psi\\phi^\\dagger -\\frac{i}{2}\\,\\psi^\\dagger\\psi^{\\dagger{\\rm t}}\\phi\\right)\\right ] , \\label{eq : gansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are masses of fermions and composite boson . </S>",
    "<S> all renormalisation factors , couplings and chemical potentials run with the scale @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the term containing the boson chemical potential is quadratic in @xmath14 so it can be absorbed into effective potential @xmath23 and the yukawa coupling is assumed to describe the decay ( creation ) of a pair of nonidentical fermions . due to @xmath24 symmetry </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential depends on the combination @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we expand the potential @xmath26 near its minima and keep terms up to order @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 where @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath30 and neglect running of yukawa coupling . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that the expansion near minimum of the effective potential ( either trivial or nontrivial ) , being quite reliable in the case of second order phase transition , may not be sufficient to quantitatively describe the first order one . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth emphasizing that the cc limit related transition from the superfluid phase to a normal one is of the first order so that a reliability of the expansion needs to be verified . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we will discuss below , at small / moderate asymmetries even a simple ansatz for the effective action the effective potential expanded up to the third order in the field bilinears gives a reasonable description of the corresponding phase diagram and provides a clear evidences that the phase transition is indeed of first order .    at the starting scale </S>",
    "<S> the system is in a symmetric regime with a trivial minimum so that @xmath31 is positive . at some lower scale </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 the coupling @xmath31 becomes zero and the system undergoes a transition to the broken phase with a nontrivial minimum and develops the energy gap .    in our rg evolution </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen the trajectory when chemical potentials run in the broken phase and the corresponding particle densities @xmath33 remain fixed so that we define `` running fermi - momenta '' for two fermionic species as @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to work with the total chemical potential and their difference so we define @xmath35 and assume that @xmath36 is always larger then @xmath37 . calculating corresponding functional derivatives , taking the trace and performing a contour integration results in the following flow equation for the effective potential @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40    here we denote @xmath41 and @xmath42 etc .    </S>",
    "<S> one notes that the position of the pole in the fermion loop integral which defines the corresponding dispersion relation is given by    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the square of the pairing gap .    in the physical limit of vanishing scale </S>",
    "<S> this dispersion relation indicates a possibility of the gapless exitation in asymmetric many - fermion systems ( much discussed sarma phase @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gappless exitation occurs at @xmath45 1 . as we will show below , this condition </S>",
    "<S> is never fulfilled so that sarma phase does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that this conclusion is valid at zero temperature case and can be altered at finite temperature where the possibility for the sarma phase still exists@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bosonic exitations are just gapless `` goldstone '' bosons as it should be .    in order to follow the evolution at constant density and running chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> we define the total derivative @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 . applying this to effective potential , </S>",
    "<S> demanding that @xmath49 is constant ( @xmath50 ) gives the set of the flow equations @xmath51    where we have defined @xmath52    the left - hand sides of these equations contain a number of higher order terms such as @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence of these couplings is obtained from evolution with fermion loops only .    </S>",
    "<S> the driving terms in these evolution equations are given by appropriate derivatives of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : potevol ] ) . in the symmetric phase we evaluate these expressions at @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the driving term for the chemical potential evolution vanishes in this case , and hence @xmath59 remains constant . in the broken phase we keep </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 non - zero and set @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the derivation can be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    neglecting </S>",
    "<S> the effect of bosonic fluctuations leads to the mean - field expression for the effective potential    @xmath62.\\ ] ]    here @xmath63 , @xmath18 is the fermion - fermion scattering length and @xmath64 is the reduced mass . imposing the condition @xmath65 we recover the bcs - like gap equation    @xmath66= 0,\\ ] ]    our approach can be applied to any type of many - fermion system but for a concretness we use a parameter set relevant to nuclear matter : @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xmath68 and large fermion - fermion scattering length ( @xmath70 ) fm . </S>",
    "<S> we use the regulators in the form suggested in @xcite for both bosons and fermions    @xmath71\\theta(k^2   - \\mid q^2   - p^{2}_{\\mu_i}\\mid),\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a parameter which defines the relative scale of the bosonic and fermionic regulators . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath74 = 1 in the following . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions for @xmath75s and @xmath76 can be obtained by differentiating the expression for the effective potential at the starting scale @xmath77 and setting the parameter @xmath60 to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the results . </S>",
    "<S> first we note that the system undergoes the transition to the broken phase at critical scale @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> its value slowly decreases when the asymmetry is increased while keeping the total chemical potential fixed . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the value of the @xmath79 is practically insensitive to the starting scale provided the scale is chosen to be larger than 10 @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the minimum of the effective potential in the unitary regime changes rather slowly with increasing @xmath0until the chemical potential mismatch reaches some critical value @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 becomes larger then @xmath81 the minimum of the effective potential drops to zero value thus indicating first order phase transition similar to the cc limit , obtained in the limit of weak coupling .     and polarisation with @xmath82 corresponding to the fermions with a larger density . </S>",
    "<S> the upper curve ( red online ) is the result of the calculations and lower curve ( blue online ) corresponds to experimental data from @xcite , width=377 ]    in fig.1 we show the results for the critical line , separating the gapped and normal phases as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath83 , where @xmath82 corresponds to the state with larger density and particle density asymmetry @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data are from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lower curve is the exponential fit of the data from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical curve approaches the fit with decreasing @xmath85 although always lies above the experimental data thus indicating the room for a further improvement of the ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> one notes , that at any value of -1/@xmath86 the phase transition always takes place when @xmath87 is greater then one . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the condition required for the sarma phase is never reached . </S>",
    "<S> one can therefore conclude that , at least at @xmath88 , sarma phase never occurs and consequently the phase transition is indeed of first order otherwise we would find that at some point the ratio @xmath89 becomes less then one . </S>",
    "<S> physically it means that the system must be viewed as an inhomogeneous mixture of the gapped and normal phases , as suggested in @xcite + the higher order couplings bring in the corrections on the level of 18 - 20 @xmath90 so the expansion of the effective potential near minimum converges reasonably well . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , in order to improve the description of the experimental data the full solution for the unexpanded potential is required but a qualitative conclusion about phase transition being of first order will remain the same regardless of the way the effective potential is treated .    </S>",
    "<S> we show on table 1 the results of the calculations for the superfluid gap in the limit of small density imbalance @xmath91 in comparison with the experimental data from @xcite . as in the case of the phase diagram the theoretical points are not far from the experimental data but still lie above them indicating that higher order terms should be included in our truncation for the effective action to achieve better agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> +    .superfluid gap [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    we have also calculated the critical value of the chemical potential mismatch @xmath92 with parameters typical for neutron matter ( scattering length @xmath93 ) fm . again at large enough @xmath94 the pairing is disrupted and the system undergoes to a normal phase . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath92 can be important for the phenomenology of neutron stars because the transport properties of the normal and superconducting phase are very different @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations gives the value @xmath95 to be compared with the qmc based results @xmath96 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as we mentioned in the introduction the other possible type of imbalance can be caused by the fermion mass mismatch . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is general enough to incorporate this case without any changes of the formalism . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider a special case when the fermi - momenta of two fermionic species are equal thus ruling out the loff phase . </S>",
    "<S> the general case of the combined mass / density asymmetry with the loff phase taken into account will be reported elsewhere .     and -1/@xmath86 with @xmath82 corresponding to the fermions with a larger density , width=377 ]    .    </S>",
    "<S> our result is shown in fig.2 in the form of the phase diagram as a function of the relative mass imbalance defined as @xmath97 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath83 . without a loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath98 is greater then @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the curve is similar to that for the case of the density imbalance although numerically the system in the gapped regime tolerates rather smaller values of mass imbalance compared to case of unequal densities . </S>",
    "<S> again , the area under the curve corresponds to the gapped phase and one above the curve is the phase with the unpaired fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> one notes that we do not consider the bec region of the phase diagram although the formalism allows to do that . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that in the bec regime ( unlike the unitary and bcs regimes ) the results show a sensitivity to the parameter @xmath74 of the boson cutoff function . </S>",
    "<S> similar situation was found in @xcite for the process of low - energy dimer - dimer scattering . </S>",
    "<S> varying @xmath74 around the so called optimal choice @xcite one could bring the calculation to a reasonable agreement with the experimental data but it should be interpreted as the fit , rather than the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity signals that one needs to include higher order terms in our ansatz for the effective action in order to achieve a better stability and reliably describe the bec part of the phase diagram .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , one can conclude that , in spite of a relative simplicity of the assumed ansatz for the effective action frg provides a good starting point for a reasonable description of the phase diagram of asymmetric many - fermion systems . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition is found to be of first order in agreement with the other theoretical results @xcite and the sarma phase never occur for this system ( at zero temperature ) which means that the system should be interpreted as an inhomogeneous mixture of the gapped and normal phases .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most obvious improvements of our approximation is to use a complete effective potential instead of expanding it near a scale dependent minimum . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is very likely that the higher order terms will result in moderate corrections thus leaving the qualitative conclusion unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> another potentially important improvement of the formalism would be an inclusion of the fermion - fermion interaction in the particle - hole ( ph ) channel leading to the gorkov - melik - barkhudarov ( gmb ) corrections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frg based studies of the gmb corrections have been performed in @xcite for the case of the balanced many - fermion systems . </S>",
    "<S> a generalisation of the approach developed in @xcite to the imbalanced systems is highly nontrivial and requires a serious technical and computational effords , although the full size frg calculations including the ph channel are beyond the scope of this paper some preliminary results indicate that the inclusion of the particle - hole interactions brings the theoretical results closer to the experimental data @xcite and , being extended to finite temperature , may significantly alter the position of the corresponding critical point . </S>"
