    "materials placed in a close vicinity to each other modify the modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this results in a change of the vacuum energy , which eventually manifests itself as a net force known as the casimir force @xcite .",
    "the casimir force has been the subject of a number of experimental investigations at object separations ranging from tens of nanometers to a few micrometers .",
    "starting with the experiments by lamoreaux @xcite and mohideen @xcite , the casimir effect has experienced an enormous increase in experimental activities in recent years @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches to the casimir force are usually built on an effective medium description of the interacting materials .",
    "within such an approximation , the local details of the materials microstructure are neglected and the objects are described by macroscopic , spatially - independent dielectric constants . while the effective medium description is in general quite satisfactory for describing dense materials that indeed look homogenous at the typical scales of the casimir force ,",
    "this is not necessarily the case for strongly heterogeneous ( `` disordered '' ) media that are made of many constituting elements ( `` scatterers '' ) well separated from one another .",
    "examples of such heterogeneous systems include nanoporous materials @xcite , clouds of cold atoms @xcite and , in a slightly different context , corrugated surfaces @xcite .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "interaction phenomena involving strongly heterogeneous materials have been little studied .",
    "seminal works on that subject considered the thermal casimir interaction between slabs made of piled layers separated from random distances ( one - dimensional disorder ) @xcite .",
    "the question of disorder was also addressed recently @xcite in the context of the casimir - polder ( cp ) interaction @xcite between a sphere and a plate @xcite . in a recent work finally , the cp interaction between a dielectric sphere ( or an atom ) and a three - dimensional disordered dielectric material was also investigated @xcite .",
    "this is the scenario we consider in the present paper .",
    "when a probe sphere or an atom interacts with a spatially heterogeneous material such as a semi - infinite disordered medium , the cp potential naturally fluctuates in space . in other words ,",
    "the casimir interaction depends on the specific statistical realization of the disorder . a shared conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite is that when the two objects are far enough from each other , precisely when the distance between them is large compared to the typical separation between two heterogeneities , the value of the casimir potential from a realization to another is well captured by its configuration average , which coincides with the prediction of the effective medium prescription . in strong contrast , at smaller distances fluctuations of the potential become larger than its mean , which is consequently no longer representative . in practice , this conclusion is crucial for measurements of quantum reflection @xcite , and more generally for any measurement of the casimir force involving heterogeneous materials .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we developed an exact mathematical treatment of the fluctuations of the cp interaction between a dielectric sphere and a dilute disordered dielectric medium , and applied it to the calculation of the mean value of the cp potential and of its standard deviation . in this paper , we consider the same geometry ( recalled in sec . [ framework ] ) , for which we perform extensive numerical simulations of the cp potential .",
    "the results of these simulations confirm the predictions of @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ numerics_sec ] ) , and additionally allow us to compute the full probability distribution of the cp potential which , for a given distribution of the scatterers , does not depend on the microscopic properties of the latter . in a second time ( sec .
