    "the most difficult task in calculating @xmath4 meson decay amplitude is to treat the hadronic matrix element @xmath7 , which is generally controlled by soft non - perturbative dynamics of qcd . here",
    "@xmath8 is one of the effective low energy transition operators of @xmath6 quark decays @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the final state mesons produced in @xmath4 decays . in the earlier years ,",
    "this hadronic matrix elements of @xmath4 decays were treated by an approximate method , which is called factorization approach @xcite . in factorization approach the hadronic matrix element of four - fermion operator",
    "is approximated as a product of the matrix elements of two currents , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the two relevant currents which can be related to @xmath8 through @xmath14 .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath12 sandwiched between the vacuum and meson state @xmath9 directly defines the decay constant of @xmath9 .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 is a pseudoscalar and @xmath12 is @xmath15 current , the relation between the matrix element and the decay constant will be @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the decay constant and the four - momentum of @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the other matrix element @xmath19 can be generally decomposed into transition form factors of @xmath20 due to its lorentz property .",
    "the explicit definition of @xmath4 meson transition form factors through such matrix elements can be found in section 4 and 5 .    in semi - leptonic decays of @xmath4 meson",
    ", the decay amplitude can be directly related to @xmath4 meson transition form factors without the factorization approximation .",
    "for example , for @xmath21 , the decay amplitude can be written in the form : @xmath22 where the form factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined through the @xmath25 transition matrix element @xmath26 in eq.([5 ] ) of section 4 .",
    "in general the form factors are functions of momentum transfer squared @xmath27 . in the region of small",
    "recoil , where @xmath28 is large and/or the final particle is heavy enough , the form factors are dominated by soft dynamics , which is out of control of perturbative qcd .",
    "however , in the large recoil region where @xmath29 , and when the final particle is light ( such as the pion ) , @xmath30 @xmath31 of energy is released .",
    "about half of the energy is taken by the light final particle , which suggests that large momentum is transferred in this process and the interaction is mainly short - distance .",
    "therefore perturbative qcd can be applied to @xmath4 to light meson transition form factors in large recoil region .    before applying perturbative method in this calculation , one must separate soft dynamics from hard interactions .",
    "this is called factorization in qcd .",
    "the factorization theorem has been worked out in ref.@xcite based on the earlier works on the applications of perturbative qcd in hard exclusive processes @xcite , where the soft contributions are factorized into wave functions or distribution amplitudes of mesons , and the hard part is treated by perturbative qcd .",
    "sudakov resummation has been introduced to suppress the long - distance contributions . recently",
    "this approach has been well developed and extensively used to analyze @xmath4 decays @xcite .",
    "there is also another direction to prove factorization in the soft - collinear effective theory @xcite , which shows correctly the power counting rules in qcd . in this work",
    "we shall calculate a set of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( p : light pseudoscalar meson , v light vector meson ) transition form factors in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach .",
    "we use the @xmath4 wave functions derived in the heavy quark limit recently @xcite , and include sudakov effects from transverse momentum @xmath32 and threshold resummation @xcite . in general",
    "there are two lorentz structures for @xmath4 wave functions .",
    "if they are appropriately defined , only one combination gives large contribution , the other combination contributes 30% .",
    "a direct calculation of the one - gluon - exchange diagram for the @xmath4 meson transition form factors suffers singularities from the end - point region of the light cone distribution amplitude with a momentum fraction @xmath33 in longitudinal direction .",
    "in fact , in the end - point region the parton transverse momenta @xmath32 are not negligible .",
    "after including parton transverse momenta , large double logarithmic corrections @xmath34 appear in higher order radiative corrections and have to be summed to all orders .",
    "in addition to the double logarithm like @xmath34 , there are also large logarithms @xmath35 which should also be summed to all orders .",
    "this is called threshold resummation @xcite .",
    "the relevant sudakov factors from both @xmath32 and threshold resummation can cure the end - point singularity which makes the calculation of the hard amplitudes infrared safe .",
    "we check the perturbative behavior in the calculation of the @xmath4 meson transition form factors and find that with the hard scale appropriately chosen , sudakov effects can effectively suppress the soft dynamics , and the main contribution comes from the perturbative region .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 is the kinematics and the framework of the pqcd approach used in the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition form factors .",
    "section 3 includes wave functions of @xmath4 meson and the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",

    "it is obvious that only @xmath64 left in the hard amplitude .",
    "factorization is one of the most important part of applying perturbative qcd in hard exclusive processes , which separates long - distance dynamics from short - distance dynamics .",
    "the factorization formula for @xmath65 transition matrix element can be written as @xmath66 where the matrix elements @xmath67 and @xmath68 define the wave functions of light pseudoscalar ( vector ) meson and @xmath4 meson , which absorb all the soft dynamics .",

    "the factorization scale is usually taken the same as renormalization scale .",
    "in practice it is convenient to work in transverse separation coordinate space ( @xmath6-space ) rather than the transverse momentum space ( @xmath73-space ) .",

    "in addition to double logarithms @xmath82 in @xmath6-space ( or say @xmath73-space equivalently ) , radiative corrections to hard amplitudes also produce large logarithms @xmath35 .",
