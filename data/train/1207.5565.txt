    "the discovery @xcite of the iron - based high - temperature superconductors has brought new theoretical and experimental challenges to condensed matter physics . despite the undoubted progress in our knowledge ( see , for example , refs . )",
    "some of the most intriguing questions still do not have a definite answer .",
    "first among them by importance is the precise form of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the most plausible candidate so far is the extended @xmath0-wave or @xmath1 state @xcite . in this state",
    "the gaps on the ( hole - like ) bands at the center and the ( electron - like ) bands at corners of the brillouin zone ( bz ) have opposite signs .",
    "the physical origin of this state is in the repulsive interband interactions , which likely dominate the pairing in these materials .",
    "although unconventional , such state from symmetry point of view is indistinguishable from a conventional @xmath0-wave state , as they both belong to the @xmath2 representation of the lattice rotation group .",
    "existence of such state is supported by theoretical calculations done within the framework of several methods",
    " random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , functional renormalization group ( frg ) @xcite , fluctuation exchange ( flex ) @xcite , as well as analytic one - loop rg and diagrammatic calculations @xcite .    in spite of a concentrated effort ,",
    "the structure of the order parameter in these superconductors has not yet been unambiguously established from experiment .",
    "the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) reveals uniform gaps on different bands @xcite for several compounds close to optimal doping , but it can not resolve the most crucial issue  the relative sign of the gaps in the electron and hole bands .",
    "this sign can be probed by some phase - sensitive experiments , similar to ones performed for the cuprate high - temperature superconductors @xcite . even though suggestions for such experiment have been made @xcite ,",
    "they have not been realized in practice yet @xcite .    the strongest support in favor of the @xmath1-state comes from inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite , which detect the emergence of a resonant magnetic mode below the superconducting transition , as expected for such sign - changing state .",
    "this mode was detected in almost all iron based superconductors and its frequency scales approximately proportional to transition temperature @xcite .",
    "however , straightforward interpretation of the data is complicated by the multiband character of the fermi surface ( fs ) and the possible strong role of interactions .    another strong argument in favor of the @xmath1-state is microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity experimentally demonstrated in some compounds within a narrow doping range , most clearly in ba[fe@xmath3co@xmath4@xmath5as@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "spin - density wave ( sdw ) has strong pair - breaking effect on the conventional @xmath6 state in which the order parameter has the same sign in all bands .",
    "such direct pair breaking is absent if the order parameter has opposite signs in the bands connected by the sdw ordering wave vector , as was confirmed by several theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "thus , the sdw is much more compatible with the @xmath1 state than with @xmath6 one .",
    "indirect probe of the bulk order parameter structure is provided by the low - temperature behavior of the thermodynamic and transport properties which is sensitive to the presence of quasiparticle states at the fermi level .",
    "extensive studies have demonstrated a very rich behavior ; all compounds fall into three relatively well - defined groups .",
    "several clean materials ( lifeas @xcite , ba@xmath3k@xmath7fe@xmath5as@xmath5@xcite ) do not show low - energy quasiparticles ( they exhibit exponential temperature dependence of the london penetration depth and no residual linear term in the specific heat ) , meaning that all bands are fully gaped .",
    "other materials , with weak impurity scattering , like lafepo @xcite , kfe@xmath5as@xmath5@xcite , bafe@xmath5[as@xmath3p@xmath8_{2}$]@xcite , shows behavior characteristic of a clean superconductor with line nodes of the gap parameter , namely , linear temperature dependence of the london penetration depth and square root magnetic field dependence of the thermal conductivity . moreover , for bafe@xmath5[as@xmath3p@xmath4@xmath5 the presence of the node lines in one of the bands has been directly confirmed by arpes @xcite .",
    "note that the existence of accidental nodes does not necessarily contradict the overall picture of the @xmath1 state  even though the order parameter may change sign within one band , what matters most is the sign of its average value over the fermi surface of this band .",
    "the third group of materials is formed by the compounds with strong scattering by dopants , such as ba[fe@xmath3co@xmath4@xmath5as@xmath5 , which have rather large residual specific heat at low temperatures @xcite , quadratic dependence of the london penetration depth @xcite , and typically show residual thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "these properties are not consistent with fully gapped s - wave order parameter . while this behavior can be interpreted as indication for the accidental nodes of the gap in combination with strong impurity scattering , it is also compatible with @xmath1 state where interband impurity scattering generates large number of subgap states and leads to finite density of states at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the discovery of another iron - based superconducting family @xcite  the chalcogenide 122 s  cast some doubts on the @xmath1 state as an universal state for all compounds , since in these materials the hole bands around the @xmath9 point are absent .",
    "possible pairing mechanisms and structures of the order parameter in view of recent experimental developments have been extensively discussed in recent reviews @xcite .",
    "-wave and @xmath1 superconductors which we consider in this paper .",
    "the superconductors are described by the green s functions @xmath10 depending on coordinate @xmath11 and matsubara frequency @xmath12 and corresponding gap parameters @xmath13 . for @xmath1 superconductor",
    "these parameters depend on the band index @xmath14 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : ueq ] for details .",
    "@xmath15 couples to the @xmath16 on the @xmath1 side . in the case of close coupling strengths with different bands ,",
    "this creates the possibility for a non - trivial relative phases @xmath17 ( as functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , and the trsb state ; _ on the right : _ the three possible states . from top to bottom - the behavior of the anomalous part of the greens functions in the symmetric and asymmetric trsb state , and the aligned state.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in this paper we explore an alternative approach for probing the superconducting order parameter in iron - based materials .",
    "it is based on proximity effect  the mutual influence of two superconductors , brought in contact .",
    "we study the vicinity of a boundary between ordinary @xmath0-wave and @xmath1 superconductors , see fig.[schemfig ] .",
    "competing interactions between the @xmath0-wave order parameter and @xmath1 gaps with opposite signs lead to frustration . as a consequence of this frustration ,",
    "several interesting effects can appear , including the possibility of new superconducting states .",
    "this is in contrast with proximity between conventional ( whether single- or multi - band ) superconductors , which is a rather straightforward phenomenon  the phases of the gaps on both sides always align and their amplitudes get closer ( i.  e. , the smaller is enhanced and the larger is suppressed - see , for example , ref . ) . in the case of a contact between @xmath0 and @xmath1 superconductors there is no obvious way to align the phases and several possibilities compete .",
    "various effects close to a boundary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 superconductors have been already considered .",
    "both phenomenological and microscopic methods were used , number of interesting and novel results were obtained and different effects have been suggested as possible fingerprints of the @xmath1 state .",
    "several papers have concentrated on the problem of a josephson junctions between @xmath0 and @xmath18 superconductors@xcite in the context of squid@xcite and josephson@xcite interferometry , and macroscopic quantum tunneling@xcite ( for a detailed review of the theoretical and experimental results see ref .  ) . in refs .",
    "the mutual effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 superconductors in contact were considered , and the possibility for a new time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) state close to the interface was discussed . the methods used to obtain the trsb state were different , however , all of them have some intrinsic limitations and the obtained solutions",
    "can not be regarded as fully microscopic and self - consistent .    in this paper",
    "we consider in detail anomalous features of system composed of a two - band @xmath1 superconductor in contact with a weaker ( i.e. , with smaller bulk critical temperature ) single - band @xmath0-wave superconductor , see fig .",
    "[ schemfig ] .",
    "we employ simple microscopic model , which assumes dirty limit in all superconductors , but neglects interband scattering in @xmath1 superconductors .",
    "this model allows us to describe the system using a minimum number of the most essential and physically transparent parameters .",
    "our approach neglects many features of iron pnictides , such as the presence of more than two gaps , interband scattering , orbital content of the bands , accidental nodes etc .",
    ", which may be relevant for detailed comparison of the theory with the experimental data .",
    "we believe , however , that the overall picture we present will survive even in a more realistic calculations .",
    "as we show below , several non - trivial effects can be expected is such structures .",
    "if the @xmath0-wave superconductor is much stronger coupled to one of the gaps on the @xmath1 side than the other , it is natural to expect that its order parameter aligns with this gap .",
    "the phase of the gap in the other band is then anti - aligned with the @xmath0-wave gap and thus frustrated .",
    "this frustration leads to the possibility of negative proximity effect  the magnitudes of _ all _ gaps being suppressed close to the boundary ( see the lower right panel on fig .  [ schemfig ] ) .",
    "this effect is unique to the interface with @xmath1 order parameter , and has to be contrasted with the case of @xmath0-@xmath6-wave structures , where the smallest gap is always enhanced ( we call this conventional proximity effect positive ) .",
    "as we demonstrate below , in the aligned state both positive and negative effects are possible .",
    "we again emphasize that the negative proximity effect can not be present for conventional @xmath0-wave order parameter ( assuming that the interface does not have extrinsic pair - breaking surface effects ) .",
    "thus , observation of such effect will be a definitive prove of the presence of @xmath1 state in iron pnictides .",
    "the reverse is not true ",
    "positive proximity effect is possible for both @xmath19 and @xmath6-wave superconductors .",
    "when the properties of the two bands on the @xmath1 side are roughly the same , and the coupling across the boundary is identical , even more interesting possibility arises @xcite . since the frustration in such system is large , another state emerges as a compromise . in it the relative phase of the gaps on the @xmath1 side deviates from its bulk @xmath20 value close to the boundary .",
    "this tilting relieves some of the frustration due to the inter - boundary coupling and disappears in the bulk ( see the upper right panel on fig .",
    "[ schemfig ] ) .",
    "such state is intrinsically complex and thus breaks the time - reversal symmetry @xcite . due to the finite phase difference between the gaps ,",
    "it is characterized by spontaneous supercurrents with opposite direction flowing between the @xmath0-superconductor and @xmath1 bands so that in ground state the total supercurrent is zero . in a more general situation of different @xmath1 gaps ,",
    "the trsb state is possible when the josephson coupling energies between the @xmath0-wave order parameter and the opposite - sign bands exactly compensate each other .",
    "another interesting consequence of our results is the possible phase transitions between these different superconducting states .",
    "the direct way to induce the trsb state is to vary the asymmetry .",
    "unfortunately , there is no obvious way to do this .",
    "more relevant experimentally are the transitions tuned by the temperature . within some range of parameters",
    "the aligned state is stable at higher temperature , but is supplanted by the trsb state at lower temperatures through a phase transition @xcite .",
    "we focus on the situation when the direct interband reflection at the interface is negligible , which is expected , for example , for the contact made at the [ 001 ] surface of iron - based superconductor . in the opposite situation , when",
    "the interband reflection is strong , a different kind of the trsb state has been predicted recently@xcite .",
    "in addition to these general effects we also consider the behavior of the density of states ( dos ) on both sides of the @xmath0-@xmath1 interface .",
    "this quantity can be directly measured using the tunneling conductivity . as we show , in the aligned state the aligned / anti - aligned gap induces positive / negative correction in the @xmath0-wave dos .",
    "thus , observation of these features can be used to probe the multiband order parameter ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare properties of the @xmath21 proximity system considered in this paper with interfaces between @xmath0- and @xmath22-wave superconductors , because @xmath22-wave represents a prominent case of sign - changing order parameter realized in cuprate superconductors .",
    "the properties of the such interfaces have been studied quite extensively , see , e.g. , refs . , and several similar anomalous features have been reported .",
    "in particular , for certain orientations the free surface of @xmath22-wave superconductors or @xmath23 interface may generate @xmath24 or @xmath25 states with broken time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the situation we consider here , these states are induced by quasiparticle reflection at the interface between the different - sign lobes .",
    "it was also found that the sign of proximity effect may be negative for both superconductors @xcite , but the conditions for this phenomenon were not studied in detail .",
    "the proximity corrections induced by the @xmath22-wave superconductor into the s - wave dos have been studied in refs .  .",
    "the most prominent feature is the peak near zero energy due to the andreev bound state which splits when the trsb state is formed at the interface .",
    "also , a smooth peak is typically formed at the energy corresponding to the maximum gap of d - wave superconductor .",
    "let us outline the structure of the paper .",
    "first , in section [ fjjsn ] we present a very simple phenomenological model of a frustrated josephson junction . in spite of its simplicity , we believe that this model catches some of the essential physics of the system .",
    "the results we obtain agree with the intuitive picture we presented above : the trsb state is stable when the josephson couplings with the opposite - sign bands are very close corresponding to strong frustration . away from this region ,",
    "the aligned states are more favorable .",
    "the frustrated josephson junction model predicts continuous phase transitions between the aligned and trsb states .    the above simple model , however , does not describe proximity effects , and misses other important details as well . to develop a more realistic description of the superconductivity on both sides of the interface",
    ", we use microscopic theory in the dirty limit presented in section [ sec : ueq ] , which describes the system by multiband usadel equations supplemented with the appropriate boundary conditions . in section [ sec : analytweak ] we present analytical results obtained in the limit of weak coupling between the superconductors , and in section [ numproc ] we describe the procedure used for numerical solution of the equations .",
    "even though this approach is strictly applicable only in the dirty limit , we expect our results to be qualitatively ( or even quantitatively ) correct in the clean case as well .    within the developed framework we study different superconducting states .",
    "we start with the more conventional aligned state ( in section [ alst ] ) and obtain both positive and negative proximity effects , depending on the values of different physical parameters . in section [ trsb ] we show that the trsb state indeed exists , and develop its quantitative description .",
    "furthermore , the proximity effect for such state is always negative ( this is also clear from general considerations ) . in section [ dac ]",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the possible limitations of our approach .",
    "to gain some insight into the phase diagram of the system let us first consider a simple phenomenological model , which nevertheless catches essential physics  josephson junction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 superconductors ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the energy of such systems depends on the phase shifts between the order parameters in the bands of the @xmath1 superconductor and the order parameter in the @xmath0-wave superconductor , @xmath26 . on general grounds ,",
    "the simplest form of this energy in reduced form can be written as @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 are josephson coupling energies between the @xmath0-wave superconductor and two bands of the @xmath1 superconductors , @xmath30 is the interband coupling energy , and @xmath31 is the thickness of @xmath1 superconductor . for definiteness , we assume @xmath32 . minimizing the energy , we get the equilibrium conditions :    @xmath33    and , as a consequence , @xmath34    excluding @xmath35 , we obtain equation for @xmath36 : @xmath37 this equation has two solutions , corresponding to the aligned and trsb states . for the aligned state , @xmath38 and we obtain @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the trsb state we obtain    [ th - frustr ] @xmath41 in particular , for the symmetric case @xmath42 , and we have @xmath43 .",
    "the energy for the frustrated state can be written as :    @xmath44    the transition to the aligned state occurs when @xmath45 , giving @xmath46 and the aligned state is stable for @xmath47 .",
    "converting to real units , we conclude that for weak josephson coupling the frustrated state is realized in the region @xmath48 .",
    "these results are summarized on fig .",
    "as we have anticipated , the trsb state exists in the region where the frustration is maximum ( @xmath49 ) , and is replaced by the aligned state when one of the couplings dominates .",
    "the transition between the two states is continuous . even though this simple model can not pretend to quantitative description of the interface",

    "the first one is the relative thinness of the @xmath0-wave layer , and the other is the large value of @xmath91 .",
    "since controlling the interface parameters @xmath85 is not easy experimentally , we also study evolution with increasing thickness of the @xmath0-wave superconductor , @xmath51 , for the same parameters of the interface .",

    "with the increase of the film thickness @xmath323 goes up , however , it stays noticeably below its bulk value even for @xmath324 .",
    "this is again due to the relatively large @xmath91 , which enhances the proximity effects away from the interface .",
    "we can see that accurate numerical computations confirm the structure of the trsb state expected from general considerations .",
    "in particular , in the trsb state the negative proximity effect is present and , depending on the precise values of various physical parameters , can be quite pronounced .",
    "one important point should be addressed before we apply our conclusions to structures involving iron - based superconductors .",
    "these materials have quite short coherence length and are likely in the clean limit . in conventional superconductors",
    "there is smooth interpolation between the clean and the dirty limit and results obtained by solving the usadel equations are expected to be qualitatively or even quantitatively correct even in the clean limit @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the boundary itself acts as a scatterer , and can push the region up to several @xmath325 away in the dirty regime .",
    "this again justifies the use of the usadel equations . in @xmath1 superconductors",
    "the situation is much less clear  because of the unconventional nature of the order parameter interband impurity scattering is pair - breaking . if strong",
    ", it can completely destabilize the @xmath1 state @xcite .",
    "however , if this scattering channel can be neglected , as we have done ( so @xmath1 is stable even close to the interface ) , then our approach should provide a reasonably good description . whether this can be justified in realistic experimental situations is unclear , at least at the moment .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the proximity effects close to a boundary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 superconductors .",
    "based on frustrated josephson junction model , we have suggested phase diagram for such system . because of the frustration , present at such interface , several interesting phenomena are possible . in the case of maximum frustration  when the coupling of the two gaps on the @xmath1 side with the @xmath0-wave superconductor is comparable  a state which breaks time - reversal symmetry appears .",
    "such superconducting state is also characterized by a negative proximity effect - because of the frustration the gap amplitudes on both sides are suppressed . in the case of significant asymmetry in the inter - boundary coupling @xmath1 can be stabilized even close to the interface , but becomes asymmetric there . interestingly",
    ", such aligned state may also lead to negative proximity effect .",
    "it is very important to note that this effect is unique to the @xmath0-@xmath1 structures , and is not present close to a conventional @xmath0-@xmath6 boundary .",

    "<S> frustration , caused by interaction of the @xmath0-wave gap parameter with the opposite - sign gaps of @xmath1 superconductor , leads to several anomalous features . in the case of strong frustration a nontrivial time - reversal - symmetry breaking ( trsb ) state , with nonzero phase angles between all gap parameters , is possible . in a more typical state , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-wave order parameter is aligned with one of the @xmath1 gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the other ( anti - aligned ) gap induces negative feature in the @xmath0-wave density of states , which can serve as a fingerprint of @xmath1 state . </S>",
    "<S> another consequence of the frustration is an extended region in the parameter space in which @xmath0-wave superconductivity is suppressed , despite being in contact with nominally stronger superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> this negative proximity effect is always present for the trsb state , but extends even into the aligned states . </S>",
    "<S> we study these effects within a simple microscopic model assuming dirty limit in all bands , which allows us to model the system in terms of minimum number of the most relevant parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the described anomalous features provide a route to establishing the possible @xmath1 state in the iron - based superconductors . </S>"
