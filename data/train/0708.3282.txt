    "pedestrian dynamics@xcite has been described by physicists through various macroscopic and microscopic models .",
    "macroscopic models , predominantly fluid - dynamic models @xcite , have the advantage of describing the large - scale dynamics of crowds , especially depicting intermittent flows and stop - and - go flows .",
    "these features are basically understood as the effect of a hybrid continuity equation @xcite with two regimes : forward pedestrian motion and backward gap propagation .",
    "details of pedestrian interactions are neglected in these models .",
    "in contrast , microscopic models can be used to describe the details of pedestrian behavior .",
    "previously proposed pedestrian models include many - particle force models@xcite , ca models @xcite and others , e.g. multi - agent approaches @xcite , which have received an increasing attention among physicists in the past . in recent years",
    ", the interest has turned to empirical or experimental studies @xcite of pedestrian flows based on video analysis @xcite .",
    "this has contributed to the calibration of current models @xcite and the discovery of new phenomena such as crowd turbulence @xcite , which can help to understand many crowd disasters .",
    "turbulent motion of pedestrians occurs , when the crowd is extremely compressed , and people attempt to gain space by pushing others , which leads to irregular displacements , or even the falling of people .",
    "if the fallen pedestrians do not manage to stand up quickly enough , they will become obstacles and cause others to fall as well .",
    "such dynamics can eventually spread over a large area and result in a crowd disaster .",
    "however , crowd turbulence is not well reproduced and understood by pedestrian models yet , which challenges current many - particle models .",
    "their shortcoming is due to the underestimation of the local interactions triggered by high densities . in the following sections",
    ", we will extend the repulsive force of the social force model @xcite , which has successfully depicted many observed self - organized phenomena , such as lane formation in counter flows and oscillatory flows at bottlenecks @xcite .",
    "previous empirical studies@xcite have revealed that people are involuntarily moved when they are densely packed , and as a consequence , the interactions increases in areas of extreme densities , which leads to an instability of pedestrian flows . when the average density is increasing , sudden transitions from laminar to stop - and - go and turbulent flows are observed .",
    "moreover , the average flow does not reach zero .",
    "we will now show how the turbulent flows can be modeled , by a small extension of the social force model@xcite .",
    "what we do is to add an extra term to the repulsive force , and show how this will give qualitatatively different dynamics , leading to turbulent flows .",
    "the social force model assumes that a pedestrian @xmath0 tries to move in a desired direction @xmath1 with desired speed @xmath2 , and adapt the actual velocity @xmath3 to the desired velocity @xmath4 within the relaxation time @xmath5 . the velocity @xmath6 , i.e. the temporal change of the position @xmath7 is also affected by repulsive forces .",
    "the social force model is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the acceleration force of pedestrian @xmath0 @xmath10    the term @xmath11 denotes the repulsive force , which represents both the attempt of pedestrian @xmath0 to keep a certain safety distance to other pedestrians @xmath12 and the desire to gain more space in very crowded situations .",
    "instead of introducing an additional force term , one may reflect the desire to gain more space under crowded conditions , by a local interaction range in the repulsive pedestrian force @xmath13 , which is proposed as follows ,    @xmath14\\vec{e}_{ij},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the maximum repulsive force ( assuming there is no overlapping / compression ) ; @xmath16 is the distance between center of masses of pedestrians ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are constants ; @xmath20 is the normalized vector pointing from pedestrian @xmath12 to pedestrian @xmath0 , @xmath21 is the angle between @xmath22 and the desired walking direction @xmath23 of pedestrian @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath24 .    in normal situations , the function @xmath25 reflects the fact that pedestrians react much stronger to what happens in front of them , and it has been suggested @xcite to have the form , @xmath26    also note that when @xmath16 is very small , i.e. , people are squeezed , the repulsive force will increase greatly , which reflects the strong reactions of those located in extremely dense areas .    in the original social force model ,",
    "the second repulsion term @xmath27 @xcite reflects the physical contacts of pedestrians , which will separate pedestrians , when collisions occur . here",
    "k is a constant , and function g(x ) is zero , if pedestrians do not touch each other , otherwise it is equal to the argument @xmath28 . in highly dense areas ,",
    "the speeds of pedestrians are very low , so the small fluctuations of @xmath16 may not lead to sufficient forces for the occurrence of turbulence , since this repulsive force is increased linearly .",
    "suppose that pedestrian @xmath0 is located in an extremely dense area .",
    "for the extended model , the small fluctuations of @xmath16 will change the repulsive forces greatly , and lead to sudden involuntary displacements . with the influence of such strong reactions",
    ", the motion of pedestrians near @xmath0 will be affected , and will further spread the irregular displacements to a larger area .",
    "thus the turbulent motion of pedestrians will be triggered .",
    "numerical simulations ( supplementary videos @xcite ) will now be carried out , of a crowd going through a bottleneck .",
    "the simulations will be performed with the extended - social - force model described in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] .    in our simulations , the desired speeds @xmath29 are assumed to be gaussian distributed with the mean value @xmath30 and the standard deviation @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time , @xmath5 is set to @xmath32 .",
    "the average mass of a pedestrian is set to @xmath33 with a standard deviation of @xmath34 .",
    "assuming that pedestrians have a strong desire to gain more space in dense areas , the maximum repulsive force @xmath15 is set to @xmath35 .",
    "note that , when pedestrians are compressed , the maximum force can be significantly larger than f. the other parameters are set to , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    the bottleneck area ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_one ] ) contains two pedestrian sources , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath40 denotes those walking from left to right , while @xmath41 represents those walking from the bottom , and then turn right to join those coming from left .",
    "these two sources give an increasing number of pedestrians in time , since we use both pedestrian sorces as well as periodic boundary conditions . with this scheme",
    "we can see how the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occur when the density is growing .",
    "the whole area is @xmath42 .",
    "the reason for this setup , is to get a situation that is comparable to the one in the empirical study@xcite .",
    "the preferred direction is defined as follows : if the vertical position of a pedestrian is above the corner , he / she will walk in the right direction .",
    "otherwise , he / she will first walk upwards until he / she is above the corner , and then turn to the right and keep walking straight ahead .",
    "note that interactions increase greatly when those two crowds intersect , especially in high density situations .",
    "the  crowd pressure\"@xcite , reflecting the irregular / chaotic motion of people , is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the local velocity variance .",
    "the local density @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 is a parameter reflecting the range of smoothing . for further aspects regarding the definition of the local density and pressure ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "the pressure stays low during an increasing density , until a point where the pressure suddenly peaks , which leads to the turbulent crowd motion ( see fig .  [ fig_two ] ) .",
    "@xcite.,width=377 ]    the fundamental diagram ( see fig .  [ fig_three ] ) demonstrates the effect of the extended repulsive force term .",
    "one can clearly see the difference at the tail of the curve , where the flow remains finite with the increase of local density .",
    "note that the flow here is not reduced to zero , even if the density is very high due to the strong interactions within the crowd , which will prevent people from stopping .",
    "if the flow is reduced to zero , which means all the people stop moving , then there is no turbulence .",
    "therefore it is essential to have nonvanishing flow for high densities .",
    "this is compatible with the empirical study @xcite .",
    "note that , at this point , the flow is no longer laminar .",
    "therefore , the strong interactions between pedestrians are potentially more dangerous for the crowd .",
    "the motion of pedestrians become turbulent , and people are pushed into all possible directions .",
    "as people are pushed by those behind , the fallen people will be trampled , if they do not get back on their feet quickly enough . however , in our simulations , we assume that pedestrians will never fall , since we are focussing on the dynamics of the crowd during a high level of crowdedness",
    ". these conditions can potentially lead to an accident , but we do not focus on the dynamics of the accident itself .        with the increment of density , the pedestrian flow suddenly turns into stop - and - go flow ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_stopandgo ] ) , which is characterized by temporarily interrupted and longitudinally unstable flow .",
    "this phenomenon is also predicted by a recent theoretical approach @xcite , which suggests that intermittent flows at bottlenecks can be triggered when the inflow exceeds the outflow .",
    ".,width=377 ]    further increment of the density will lead to turbulent flows .",
    "figure  [ fig_four](a ) shows a typical trajectory of the turbulent motion from our simulations .",
    "we can see that , first , the curve is smooth , which represents a laminar flow , then suddenly , vibrations occur due to the turbulence . also , note that the pedestrian is sometimes even pushed backwards .",
    "the turbulent motion does not vanish until an individual walks out of the extremely dense central area , where the two streams intersect .",
    "figure [ fig_four](b ) is an example of the temporal evolution of an individual s velocity components @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "one can clearly see the irregular motion into all directions .",
    "although no large eddies are observed , as in turbulent fluids , there is still an analogy to the turbulence of the currency exchange market @xcite .",
    "this can be characterized by the probability density function of velocity increments and the so - called structure function , eq .",
    "[ eq_structure ] .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]    the shape of the probability density function of velocity increment is a typical indicator for turbulence , if the time shift @xmath50 is small enough , and is given by @xmath51    the structure function , @xmath52 reflects the dependence of the relative speed on the distance .",
    "we find that the probability functions of velocity increment is sharply peaked for turbulence , while it is parabolic - like for laminar flow ( see fig .  [ fig_five ] ) , when the time shift @xmath50 is small enough .",
    "the structure function has a slope of @xmath53 , when the distance is small , while at large steps , the slope turns to @xmath54 due to the increased interactions in crowded regions .",
    "both of the functions are compatible to the analysis of the video recordings of the jamarat bridge@xcite .     for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( black curves , top ) , @xmath57 ( blue curves , second ) , @xmath58 ( green curves , third ) , and @xmath59 ( red curves , bottom ) . for the clarity of the presentation ,",
    "the curves are shifted in the vertical direction .",
    "the non - parabolic , peaked curve for small values of @xmath50 distinguishes turbulence from laminar flows .",
    "( b ) the log - log plot of the structure function for crowd turbulence .",
    "the average density here is @xmath60,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]   for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( black curves , top ) , @xmath57 ( blue curves , second ) , @xmath58 ( green curves , third ) , and @xmath59 ( red curves , bottom ) . for the clarity of the presentation ,",

    "in summary , an added social force component , reflecting the strong interactions in the extremely crowded areas is proposed for the simulation of crowd turbulence , which questions current many - particle models .",
    "the transition from laminar to stop - and - go and turbulent flows is observed in the simulations .",
    "the fundamental diagram is reproduced and demonstrates the effects of the extended repulsive forces at highly dense situations , i.e. the average local flow is not reduced to zero .",
    "a typical turbulent trajectory and velocity components are presented .",
