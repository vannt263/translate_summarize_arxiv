    "the guiding and steering of an optical beam is made possible by virtue of a refractive index of the medium .",
    "several techniques such as mechanical  @xcite , thermal  @xcite , electrical  @xcite , acousto - optical  @xcite and all optical  @xcite have been proposed to control the refractive index for beam deflection .",
    "however , all - optical methods have been paid much effort owing to many striking features such as high speed , efficiency , and quick nonlinear response time .",
    "the nonlinear optical interactions between light and matter creates a new avenue to control over beam propagation dynamics through a medium .",
    "this is feasible as the absorptive and dispersive properties of the medium can be modified by the strength of the interactions .",
    "such manipulation of dispersion and absorption leads to many novel phenomena including electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , coherent population trapping(cpt )  @xcite , saturated absorption techniques  @xcite or lasing without inversion(lwi )  @xcite .",
    "the sharp refractive index changes near the centre of the transparency window for the eit medium is the key concept for beam deflection  @xcite .",
    "the ability to control of light deflection is also possible by use of transverse magnetic field through an atomic medium  @xcite .",
    "further a suitable spatially dependent control field can be used to modulate the refractive index along the transverse direction .",
    "this spatially modulated refractive index generates several effects such as induced focusing  @xcite , waveguiding  @xcite and anti - waveguiding  @xcite .",
    "most of the eit - based schemes for producing beam deflection and guiding have low transmission due to presence of medium absorption  @xcite .",

    "@xcite have theoretically studied the beam deflection in an arg medium .",
    "they have used spatially inhomogeneous pump beam to deflect a weak probe beam .",
    "they have found that the deflection angle is increased by an order of magnitude as compared to eit medium .",
    "nonetheless the probe field experiences a large amount of gain during the propagation through a @xmath1-type arg medium  @xcite .",
    "this large gain makes the probe beam propagation unstable and thus limits the practical application  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the input spot sizes for individual gaussian profiles of pump and probe beams are equal to @xmath2 cm and @xmath3 mm , respectively .",
    "hence , the diffraction spreading of such beams are not relevant since rayleigh length is much larger than the length of the medium . focusing laser beams into smaller spots  @xcite and increasing the spatial resolution of arbitrary images",
    "@xcite is a fundamental problem in all - optical image processing  @xcite .",
    "distortion and absorption holds the fundamental limitation for the creation , detection , or propagation of small images .",
    "this limitation affects the applications such as efficient transfer and conversion of small images  @xcite , steering  @xcite or optical manipulation of light beams  @xcite .",
    "here we address these issues by considering the propagation of diffraction - limited beams and arbitrary images through a controllable arg medium . in this paper",

    "the high refractive index together with gain allow to deflect the probe beam when it is launched at the wings of the pump beam .",
    "the control field parameters such as detuning and intensity can be used to control the transmission intensity and width of the deflected probe beam .",
    "next , we reveal splitting of a single super - gaussian probe beam into two gaussian beams by use of two - peak pump beam structure .",
    "the bright(cladding ) and dark(core ) regions of the pump field profile induces a high(cladding ) and low(core ) refractive index of the probe field which lead to formation of an anti - waveguide structures inside the medium .",
    "more specifically , the super - gaussian probe beam guided out from the core where it was injected .",
    "the diffraction - limited probe beam gets focus in the cladding due to the converging refractive index .",
    "we also observe that the transmitted probe beam gets the shape of the pump beam with finesse two times larger than the initial finesse of the pump beam .",
    "further , we demonstrate the cloning of a doughnut - shaped pump beam structure onto the probe beam .",
    "our numerical simulation shows that the cloned probe has a controllable gain with high finesse .",
    "furthermore , our scheme can be employed for cloning the arbitrary pump images to the probe beam even though the pump images are severely distorted due to diffraction .",

    "the spatially dependent pump structure generates a probe gain profile which is one of the key components in realising the deflection of the probe beam if it is off - centered with respect to the pump beam . in absence of the control field @xmath108 , the gain profile of the probe field is fifteen times larger than in case of control field @xmath109",
    ". this large gain can create modulation instability of system  @xcite .",
    "therefore a controllable gain of the medium is required to avoid the modulation instability .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] that the position dependent probe gain can be substantially suppressed by a uniform control field with @xmath110 .",

    "the blueshifted the control field detuning @xmath112 can generate a concave refractive index profile onto the medium . therefore the refractive index gradient allows us to focus or defocus the probe beam towards the centre of the pump beam . as a result the probe field propagates through the gain window with narrowing or broadening , respectively .",

    "the position dependent refractive index and gain both increase in the bright region whereas it decreases at the dark region of the doughnut shaped pump beam .",
    "in other words , lgp@xmath113 induces a diverging gradient index in the region @xmath114 0.005 cm whereas a converging gradient index exists in regions 0.005 @xmath115 0.02 cm of the medium . thus bright and dark regions of lgp@xmath113 resembles a waveguide and anti waveguide structure inside the atomic medium .",
    "fig.[fig : figure3a ] is also show that the waveguide and anti - waveguide features are accompanied with gain and absorption , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the probe beam is guided out from dark region and confined at bright region in the course of propagation inside the medium .",
    "hence the shape of the pump beam profile can be efficiently transfered to the transmitted probe beam .",
    "we have simulated numerically the propagation equations for pump  ( [ beam_eq_control ] ) and probe ( [ beam_eq_probe ] ) beams by split step operator method  @xcite to demonstrate the spatial susceptibility as well as diffraction effects on the beam s propagation dynamics .",
    "first , we study how the deflection of a probe beam can be controlled by a spatial dependence of the pump rabi frequency .",
    "the shape and position of a probe beam is given by eq  ( [ profile_probe ] ) at the entry face of the medium .",
    "[ fig : figure4a ] shows the spatial evolutions of the probe beam with @xmath116  mm and @xmath117 m when the peak of pump beam is centered at the origin @xmath118 with @xmath119 m .",
    "initially the overlap area between the probe and pump beam is very negligible .",
    "the overlap area is gradually increased due to the broadening of both the beams during propagation .",
    "it is evident from this figure that after a propagation of one rayleigh length , the probe beam progressively enters the pump region .",
    "the bright region of the pump beam tends to refract the probe beam into it and subsequently enhances the probe beam amplitude . as a result",
    ", the probe beam is focused towards the high intensity region of the pump and remains confined there .",
    "ii is noteworthy that the probe beam gains the initial shape of the pump beam and retains this shape as it propagates along the @xmath79 axis .",
    "similarly , if the peak position of the probe beam is shifted along the positive @xmath95-direction then it can be dragged by the pump beam towards the pump line centre .",
    "[ fig : figure4b ] exhibits the effect of control field detuning onto the propagation dynamics of a probe pulse at @xmath120 cm .",
    "it is seen that the deflected probe beam becomes narrower at redshifted detuning as compared to a blue - shifted detuning .",
    "therefore the sign of the detuning of the control field gives an additional flexibility to control the width of the deflected probe beam .",
    "thus the arg medium not only acts as an effective beam deflector but also can act like a lens with a wide focal length tunability .",

    "[ fig : figure5 ] .",
    "the position dependent pump beam creates two gain peaks together with converging refractive index in the probe susceptibility which is similar to the grey double dashed dotted line in fig.[fig : figure3 ] .",
    "the gain and spatial inhomogeneity of the refractive index is accountable for this splitting of a single super - gaussian probe beam into two gaussian beams .",
    "the converging lens effect in the intense regions of the pump leads to focusing of the cloned probe beam towards it .",
    "the finesse of the transmitted probe beam can be defined as the ratio of the spacing between peaks to the width of peaks .",
    "the transmitted probe beam width is reduced by a factor of 1.5 and the peaks separation are increased by 0.7 mm as compared to the initial shape of the pump beam .",

    "[ fig : figure5 ] the transmitted probe beam structure is preserved even though the pump beam suffers distortion due to diffraction .      in this section ,",

    "an all - optical anti - waveguide structure can be formed inside the medium with use of lgp@xmath113 beam which has zero intensity at the beam centre .",
    "the dark and bright regions of lgp@xmath113 beam give rise to minimum and maximum refractive index gradient on the probe susceptibility . as a results",

    "the centre of the dark region of the doughnut pump beam is the initial location of probe beam .",
    "the diverging refractive index gradient and diffraction leads to the probe beam leaving the core region and slowly enter the high intensity regions of the pump beam .",

    "thus the probe energy is guided into the annular ring of the doughnut - shaped beam and leaving a zero intensity in the dark region .",

    "the two - dimensional transverse profile of the pump beam creates gain for the probe beam wherever two - photon raman condition is satisfied .",
