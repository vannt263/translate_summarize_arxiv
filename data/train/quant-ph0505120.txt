    "although the theory of quantum games , originated in 1999 by meyer @xcite and eisert , wilkens , and lewenstein @xcite is only six years old , numerous results obtained during these years @xcite have shown that extending the classical theory of games to the quantum domain opens new interesting possibilities .",
    "although eisert and wilkens @xcite noticed that any quantum system which can be manipulated by two parties or more and where the utility of the moves can be reasonably quantified , may be conceived as a quantum game , the extreme fragility of quantum systems may make playing quantum games difficult . in this respect it is interesting whether quantum games with all their ` genuine quantum ' features could be played with the use of suitably designed macroscopic devices .",
    "the aim of this letter is to show that this is possible , at least in the case of a ` restricted ' version of a two - players , two - strategies quantum game proposed by marinatto and weber @xcite in which only identity and spin - flip operators are used .",
    "moreover , we show that this can be done at once by anyone equipped with a pack of 10 cards bearing numbers @xmath0 .",
    "our idea of playing quantum games with macroscopic devices stems from the invention devices proposed by one of us @xcite that perfectly simulate the behavior and measurements performed on two maximally entangled spin-1/2 particles .",
    "for example , they allow to violate the bell inequality with @xmath1 , exactly ` in the same way ' as it is violated in the epr experiments .",
    "a more recent and further elaborated model consists of two coupled spin-1/2 for which measurements are defined using ` randomly breaking measurement elastics ' @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the older model for a single spin-1/2 for which measurements are defined using ` randomly selected measurement charges ' @xcite . in order to play marinatto and",
    "weber s ` restricted ' version of two - players , two - strategies quantum game we shall not use the ` full power ' of this machine , but we give its complete description such that the principle of what we try to do is clear .",
    "the quantum machine is a model for a spin-1/2 particle consisting of a point particle with negative charge @xmath2 on the surface @xmath3 of a 3-dimensional unit sphere @xcite .",
    "the spin - state @xmath4 is represented by the point @xmath5 on @xmath3 .",
    "all points of the sphere represent states of the spin : points on the surface @xmath3 correspond to pure states , interior points @xmath6 represent mixed states @xmath7 , such that the point @xmath8 in the center of the sphere represents the density matrix @xmath9 .",
    "hence states are represented equivalently as this is the case in the bloch model for the spin 1/2 .",
    "a measurement @xmath10 along the direction @xmath11 consists in placing a positive charge @xmath12 in @xmath11 and a positive charge @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",
    "the charges @xmath12 and @xmath15 are taken at random from the interval @xmath16 $ ] and their distribution within this interval is assumed to be uniform , but they have to satisfy the constraint @xmath17 so in fact we can think that only @xmath12 is taken at random from the interval @xmath18 $ ] and that @xmath19 .",
    "if the initial state of the machine is as depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : mqg01 ] , the forces @xmath20 and @xmath21 between the negative charge @xmath2 and , respectively , positive charges @xmath12 and @xmath15 are @xmath22        if @xmath23 the electromagnetic forces pull the particle to the point @xmath24 where it stays and the measurement is said to yield outcome ` spin up ' , and if @xmath25 the particle is pulled to @xmath14 yielding outcome ` spin down ' . denoting the angle between directions @xmath26 and @xmath11 by @xmath27 , one obtains @xmath28 and @xmath29 hence the probability that @xmath23 is : @xmath30which , since @xmath12 is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath18 $ ] , yields @xmath31and similarly @xmath32which coincides with the quantum mechanical probability distribution over the set of outcomes for a spin-1/2 experiment .",
    "a macroscopic model for a quantum system of two entangled spin-1/2 particles in the singlet state @xcite can be constructed by ` coupling ' two such sphere models by adding a rigid but extendable rod with a fixed center that connects negative charges representing ` single ' particles ( fig .",
    "fig : mqg02 ) . because of this rod",
    "the two negative charges are ` entangled ' since a measurement performed on one of them necessarily influences the state of the other one .",
    "the ` restricted ' version of two - players , two - strategies quantum games proposed by marinatto and weber is as follows : the ` quantum board ' of the game consists of two qubits that are in a definite initial state ( entangled or not ) .",
    "each of two players obtains one qubit and his / her strategy consists in applying to it either the identity or the spin - flip operator , or a probabilistic mixture of both .",
    "then the state of both qubits is measured and the players get their payoff calculated according to the specific bimatrix of the played game and the results of measurements .",
    "marinatto and weber in their paper @xcite considered a game with a payoff bimatrix :      which , if @xmath34 , is the payoff bimatrix of the battle of the sexes game ( alice wants to go to the opera while bob prefers to watch television , so if they both choose _ o _ alice s payoff @xmath35 is bigger than bob s payoff @xmath36 , and if they both choose _ t _ their payoffs are the opposite .",
    "since they both prefer to stay together , if their strategies mismatch they are both unhappy and get the lowest payoff @xmath37 ) .",
    "marinatto and weber showed that if the initial state of the pair of qubits is not entangled , the quantum version of the game reproduces exactly the classical battle of the sexes game played with mixed strategies , but if the game begins with an entangled state of the ` quantum board ' : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and allow for new ` solutions ' of the game not attainable in the classical or factorizable quantum case .",
    "[ [ marinatto - and - webers - restricted - quantum - game - realized - by - the - macroscopic - quantum - machine ] ] marinatto and weber s ` restricted ' quantum game realized by the macroscopic quantum machine ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    let us look now how simply marinatto and weber s ` restricted ' quantum game can be macroscopically realized with the use of the macroscopic quantum machine .",
    "we describe firstly the macroscopic realization of the game that begins with a general entangled state @xmath41 or @xmath42 . the initial configuration of the macroscopic machine that realizes the state ( [ in ] ) is depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : mqg02 ] .        applying the spin - flip operator by any of the players",
    "is realized as exchanging the labels _ o _ and _ t _ on his / her sphere .",
    "let us note that this is a local operation since it does not influence in any way the sphere of the other player .",
    "applying the identity operator obviously means doing nothing .",
    "when both players make ( or not ) their movements , the measurement is performed which , similarly to the original aerts proposal in @xcite , consists in placing a positive charge @xmath12 on the north pole and a positive charge @xmath15 on the south pole of the alice s sphere , and the same charges , respectively , on the south and north poles of the bob s sphere ( i.e. , on the bob s sphere @xmath12 is placed on the south pole and @xmath15 on the north pole ) .",
    "again , charges @xmath12 and @xmath15 are taken at random from the interval @xmath16 $ ] with uniform distribution satisfying the constraint @xmath17 assuming for simplicity that forces between ` left ' positive and ` right ' negative , resp . `",
    "right ' positive and ` left ' negative charges are negligible ( which can be achieved by using a rod that is long enough or by suitable screening ) we can make analogous calculations as for the single sphere model . the forces @xmath20 and @xmath21 between the negative charges @xmath2 placed at both ends of the rod and , respectively , positive charges @xmath12 and @xmath15 are latexmath:[\\[f_{1}=c\\frac{qq_{1}}{|b|^{2}}\\text { \\qquad and\\qquad   } f_{2}=c\\frac{qq_{2}}{%    depends on which force , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , is bigger . if the labels @xmath44 and @xmath45 are placed as on fig .  [ fig : mqg02 ] , the result of the measurement is @xmath46 iff @xmath47 , and @xmath48 iff @xmath25 .",
    "the probability that @xmath47 is as follows : @xmath49which , since @xmath12 is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath18 $ ] , yields @xmath50of course in this case @xmath51    let us assume , following marinatto and weber , that alice applies the identity operator ( in our model : undertakes no action ) with probability @xmath52 and applies the spin - flip operator ( in our model : exchanges the labels @xmath44 and @xmath45 on her sphere ) with probability @xmath53 , and bob does the same on his side with respective probabilities @xmath2 and @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , when both players make ( or not ) their movements , the configuration depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : mqg02 ] occurs with probability @xmath55 , and the result of the measurement is @xmath56 with probability @xmath57 and @xmath48 with probability @xmath58 . taking into account three other possibilities ( alice undertaking no action and bob exchanging the labels , alice exchanging the labels and bob undertaking no action , and both of them exchanging their labels ) which occur with respective probabilities @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , and the payoff bimatrix ( [ bos ] )",
    ", we obtain the following formulas for the expected payoff of alice :           \\end{array } \\label{payoffbob}\\]]let us note that these formulas , although obtained from the ` mechanistic ' model through ` classical ' calculations are _ exactly _ the same as formulas ( 7.3 ) of marinatto and weber @xcite for the payoff functions of alice and bob in their ` reduced ' version of the quantum battle of the sexes game that begins with a general entangled state ( [ in ] ) .",
    "the macroscopic model of the quantum game that begins with a non - entangled state @xmath64 can be obtained by putting in ( [ in ] ) @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which means that in this case the rod on fig .",
    "fig : mqg02 leads from the north pole of alice s sphere to the south pole of bob s sphere . in this case we obtain @xmath67   \\\\   & \\text { } + q(\\gamma -\\beta ) + \\beta , \\\\",
    "\\overline{\\$}_{b}(p , q ) & = q[p(\\alpha + \\beta -2\\gamma ) -\\alpha       this result might be surprising since the rod connecting two particles represents entanglement in the macroscopic quantum machine so one could expect that when the initial state of the game is not entangled , this connection should be broken .",
    "however , it should be noticed that in the device depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : mqg02 ] the rod connecting two particles is , in fact , redundant .",
    "the reason for which we left it on fig .",
    "[ fig : mqg02 ] is twofold : firstly , we wanted to stress that our idea of a macroscopic device that allows to play quantum games stems from the ideas published in aer91,aeretal00 , and secondly , this rod will be essential for macroscopic simulations of other quantum games , more general than marinatto and weber s ` restricted ' ones .",
    "thus , we see that what vanishes in the ` non - entanglement ' limit of the considered quantum game is the ` randomness in measurement ' , since now ( except for the zero - probability case when @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) the initial state of the machine does not change in the course of the measurement whatever is the value of @xmath12 .",
    "[ [ marinatto - and - webers - restricted - quantum - game - realized - with - a - pack - of-10-cards ] ] marinatto and weber s ` restricted ' quantum game realized with a pack of 10 cards ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the lack of any importance of the connecting rod and the fact that all distances , charges , and forces in the device depicted on fig .",
    "fig : mqg02 are symmetric with respect to the middle of the rod allow to produce a still more simple model of the considered game , in fact so simple that it can be played with a piece of paper and a pack of 10 cards bearing numbers @xmath70 .",
    "the game is played in three steps . in the first step the initial ` quantum ' state of the game ( [ in ] ) is fixed . since only the squared moduli of entanglement coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 are important and @xmath73 , it is enough to fix a point representing latexmath:[$%         in the next step the players exchange , or not , labels @xmath44 and @xmath45 on their sides modelling in this way application of spin - flip , resp .",
    "identity , operators . in the third step a measurement",
    "is made , which is executed by choosing at random a number in the interval @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "if a chosen number is smaller than @xmath71 which , if the probability distribution is uniform in @xmath76 $ ] , happens with the probability @xmath71 , the result of the measurement is given by labels placed by both players close to @xmath77 , otherwise by labels placed close to @xmath78 .",
    "although random choosing of a number may be executed in many ways , we propose to use a pack of 10 cards bearing numbers @xmath70 which allows to draw one by one , with uniform probability , consecutive decimal digits of a number until we are sure that the emerging number is either definitely bigger or definitely smaller than latexmath:[$%    that _ exactly _ equals @xmath71 since its probability is @xmath78 , as well as the fact that in a series of @xmath80 drawings we actually choose one of @xmath81 numbers represented by separate points uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath82 $ ] ) . of course calculations of the payoff functions that we made while describing the device depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : mqg02 ] are still valid in this case , so we again obtain perfect macroscopic simulation of marinatto and weber s ` restricted ' two - players , two - strategies quantum games .",
    "thus , one does not have to be equipped with sophisticated and costly devices and perform subtle manipulations on highly fragile single quantum objects in order to play quantum games , at least in the ` restricted ' marinatto and weber s version : all that suffices is a piece of paper and a pack of 10 cards !"
