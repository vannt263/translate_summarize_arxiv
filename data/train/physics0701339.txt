    "the notion of accelerating networks has been considered before @xcite , and here we consider the notions of network acceleration as discussed by gagen and mattick in @xcite .",
    "although interesting , the definitions in @xcite seem constrictive in that they are applicable only to a specific algorithm , and the concept of acceleration is static in nature , i.e. , a given network is considered to be either accelerating , non - accelerating , or decelerating throughout its evolution .",
    "contrary to this , the notion of acceleration in physical systems refers to the nature of the evolution of a system at a specific moment in time , suggesting that acceleration in the context of complex networks should be reconsidered .",
    "in addition , it is imperative that network acceleration be measurable for empirical networks",
    ".    we review the model of gagen and mattick in section [ sec : gm ] and critically examine the proposed concept of network acceleration in section [ sec : approach ] .",
    "this is followed by a new definition of network acceleration in section [ sec : definition1 ] .",
    "this might be used to describe a network at any stage of its evolution ( whether decaying , growing , or neither ) , and applies to both directed and undirected networks .",
    "we then extend the analysis to incorporate weighted links .",
    "we demonstrate the use of the new definition in a simple empirical case study in section [ sec : case ] , and conclude our discussion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the model of gagen and mattick ( gm - model ) , as in many other conventional out - of - equilibrium evolving network models , the system evolves by introducing _ exactly _ one new node at each time step .",
    "the key feature of the model is that the new node connects to the existing single - component network through a time - dependent number of links , whereas in most evolving network models @xcite the new node attaches to the existing network with a fixed , time - independent number of links @xmath6 , as demonstrated in fig .",

    "these links might be directed or undirected , weighted or unweighted.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    here we shall consider the scenario whereby the new node attaches with undirected binary ( unweighted ) links . specifically , we assume that each new node attaches with _ on average _ @xmath7 links . whether or not the number of links added per time step is a stochastic process , the actual evolution of the system will be if a stochastic attachment algorithm ( random , preferential , or otherwise ) is employed .",
    "clearly , the maximum number of links with which the new node can connect with to the existing network , is equal to the number of nodes within the existing network .",
    "gagen and mattick actually specify the functional form describing the expected rate of link addition @xmath7 as @xmath8 here @xmath9 is an described as an acceleration parameter and @xmath10 as a probability constant with the constraint of @xmath11 .",
    "gagen and mattick describe the type of a network in terms of @xmath9 as either decelerating ( @xmath12 ) , non - accelerating ( @xmath13 ) , accelerating ( @xmath14 ) , or hyper - accelerating ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "note also that the hyper - accelerating network has a finite time scale for which it can be applied in that the maximum number of links that can possibly be added to the system is @xmath0 .",
    "this sets an upper bound on @xmath7 after which the network can not hyper - accelerate , i.e. , in order to continue hyper - acceleration , it would have to introduce more than @xmath0 links per time step , which is impossible without allowing for multiple links between any pair of nodes .",
    "we also note also that so far the actual attachment mechanism , random or otherwise , has not been discussed , meaning that the _ accelerating nature of the network is simply related to the rate of link addition_. this is an important point to consider because although the expected number of links added for the new node is @xmath7 , the variance in this will differ between microscopic attachment mechanisms .",
    "indeed , the variance could be zero for integer @xmath7 , corresponding to exactly @xmath7 begin added every time step , or the number of links to add could be drawn from a probability distribution with mean @xmath7 .",
    "even though the number of links to be added might be deterministic , one still needs to specify the algorithm to determine to which nodes within the existing network these links are attached .",
    "the notion of network acceleration is applicable to situations whereby the rates of node and link addition are not stochastic . as such , in introducing the concepts key to their understanding , it is useful to concentrate on this conceptually simpler scenario",

    "this might be a realisation of an algorithm or an empirically observed evolving network . at time @xmath21 we have an initial configuration of @xmath22 nodes and @xmath23 links . at each time step , a quantity of new nodes @xmath24 are added and they are connected to the pre - existing network with some number of binary links @xmath7 .",
    "these are both integer quantities . in this scenario",
    "no new links are formed between existing nodes within the network , although this feature could be incorporated . for now , we shall assume that @xmath25 such that exactly one new node is added per time step . as such , at time @xmath26 the number of nodes is @xmath27 .",
    "the maximum number of links that could have been introduced on attaching the @xmath28th node is clearly @xmath22 as the new node can link to each previous node with at most one link .",
    "similarly , for a node added at time @xmath1 , the total number of nodes is @xmath29 and the maximum number of links that could have been used to connect it is @xmath30 . for this process ,",

    "this might be some empirically observed network growth or the behaviour of some growth algorithm .",
    "would this be described an accelerating , decelerating or non - accelerating network ? clearly , different regimes of this particular network evolution might satisfy differing descriptions .",
    "as such , we must re - define the accelerating network to encompass this feature .",
    "one might expect that one could identify the regimes of accelerating , non - acceleration and deceleration with relative ease , writing these phenomena in terms of the mean degree @xmath37 of the network .",
    "specifically , one might expect that if the addition of a new node via some number of links results in the mean degree of the entire network to increase , the network would be described as accelerating .",
    "likewise , if the mean degree remains constant , the network is not accelerating and , if the mean degree decreases with the addition of new nodes , the network could be considered decelerating .     a schematic illustration of a network evolving over fourteen time steps in the link and node phase space ( solid line ) . the mean degree of the network is given by @xmath37 , and the dashed line represents half the mean degree of the system at time step @xmath38 ( and time step @xmath39 ) .",
    "at time step @xmath38 the network accelerates but the mean degree actually decreases.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    although these ideas are intuitively appealing , one can envisage a scenario whereby a network might be accelerating without increasing its mean degree .",
    "this event can occur if a network has undergone rapid deceleration such that the rate of node addition is very low even though it might have been high previously . at some point",
    "the ratio of number of links added to the number of nodes added over a time step , @xmath40 / [ n(t ) - n(t-1)]$ ] , might be less than that for the existing network as a whole , @xmath41 , thereby decreasing the average degree @xmath42 while still constituting network acceleration .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanplot ] , in which at time step @xmath43 the network accelerates , although the mean degree of the system decreases as the ratio @xmath41 decreases . in order for the mean degree to increase",
    "the trajectory would have to exceed the dash line whose gradient represents half the mean degree of the system at time @xmath43 .    in order to identify the different regimes of network acceleration",
    ", we must relate the rate of increase in the number of links with the rate of addition of new nodes , denoting the rate of link addition and node addition by the approximate derivatives    @xmath44    we can then define the regimes of network acceleration .",
    "the important ratio is that of the rate of link addition to the rate of node addition , @xmath45 , the evolution of which prescribes a network measure .",
    "we define network _ acceleration _ @xmath46 as    @xmath47    we approximate the discrete values with continuous derivatives and define the following three regimes :    @xmath48    as such , a single evolving network might navigate all regimes . note that the definition of @xmath46 allows more than one node to be added per time step .",
    "it is interesting to note that within this definition of network acceleration , a decaying network ( losing nodes ) could accelerate . also , we note that the definition holds for directed graphs .",
    "the above definition alludes to the notion of network _ velocity _",
    "@xmath49 , which we define as    @xmath50    this velocity is simply the gradient of the network trajectory in the link - node phase space as in fig .",

    "this is a relatively simple process .",
    "the key components in the definition of the network acceleration for unweighted graphs were the rates of node and link addition , both of which are macroscopic properties of the system .",
    "similarly , we can observe the macroscopic weight of the system , denoted @xmath58 , which reflects the total weight of all the links within the network expressed as    @xmath59    the total weight of the evolving network at time @xmath1 is constrained by the total number of possible links , given by @xmath60 .    in a similar manner to the unweighted scenario ( see eq .  [ eqn : approximate ] for comparison ) , we make use of the approximate derivatives and write @xmath61 for useful comparison between networks , it in important to normalise the weights such that for any link @xmath62 $ ] otherwise @xmath63 would vary enormously according to the type of network under consideration the evolution of these rates for weighted graphs are then used to define velocity and acceleration as    @xmath64    note that if the weights are restricted to be binary in nature , the above weighted definitions of eq .",

    "[ eqn : approximate ] , i.e. , @xmath65 and @xmath66 as weights are made binary , which is a desirable feature of any weighted network metric .",
    "the above definition is then possibly the most general definition in that it can be applied to both weighted and unweighted , as well as directed or undirected , evolving networks .",
    "the definitons ( weighted and unweighted ) outlined in this section have been introduced for the scenario whereby the rates of node and link addition are not stochastic .",
    "they are , infact , easily applied to stochastic situations . in this case",
    ", the corresponding measures would be the expected velocity @xmath67 and expected acceleration @xmath68 .",
    "in certain cases , it might be possible to achieve this by simply replacing @xmath24 , @xmath7 and @xmath63 by their expectation values although in general this will _ not _ be suitable . for this to be appropriate we require rather specific constraints on the evolution of the system , namely that the rate of node addition @xmath24 is deterministic and the rate of link ( weight )",
    "addition is not path dependent .",
    "that is , @xmath7 is not dependent on the number of links added at the last time step ( i.e. is independent of @xmath69 ) .    in general , to evaluate the required quantities properly",
    ", we must consider all possible contributing trajectories of the system s evolution and their corresponding probabilities .",
    "we must incorporate the possibility that the rates of node and link addition at a given time step might not be independent of each other and that their outcomes might also influence the evolution of the network at the next time step .",
    "for the unweighted case , this would give    @xmath70\\left(\\frac{a}{c}\\right )   \\nonumber\\\\ \\langle a(t ) \\rangle & = & \\sum_{a , b , c , d } \\bigg ( p[(m(t+1)=b)\\cap(n(t+1)=d)\\cap(m(t)=a)\\cap(n(t)=c ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ { } & { } & \\left(\\frac{b}{d}-\\frac{a}{c}\\right ) \\bigg).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "this simple example demonstrates that it is reasonable to consider network velocity and acceleration as time - dependent properties of networks as opposed to considering them as static properties of networks as suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is also very straightforward to measure the introduced characteristics , velocity and acceleration , for empirical networks , which further supports their role in network characterization .",
    "we have revisited the framework of network acceleration suggested by gagen and mattick @xcite .",
    "we have explored the limits of the proposed definition of network acceleration and , based on our findings , have provided an alternative definition for accelerating networks .",
    "perhaps most important is the conceptual difference between the two definitions : the concept of network acceleration as introduced in this paper refers to the properties of the network at a particular moment in time as opposed to an algorithm governing the evolution of the network as suggested in @xcite .",
