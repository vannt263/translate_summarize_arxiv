    "the reason why it nevertheless works here is that we made the assumptions of constant @xmath252 and @xmath253 in the relevant frequency regime .",
    "this means that , when returning to the master equation , the terms describing dissipation of the effective modes @xmath120 and @xmath78 are given by @xmath254 \\hat{x } + \\kappa_2 { \\cal d}[\\hat{a}_2 ] \\hat{x } \\\\ & = & \\kappa_+ { \\cal d}[\\hat{a}_+ ] \\hat{x } + \\kappa_- { \\cal d}[\\hat{a}_-]\\hat{x } \\notag \\\\ & + & \\kappa_{+- } \\big(\\hat{a}_- \\hat{x } \\hat{a}_+^\\dagger + \\hat{a}_+ \\hat{x } \\hat{a}_-^\\dagger \\notag \\\\ & & \\qquad - \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{\\hat{a}_+^\\dagger \\hat{a}_- + \\hat{a}_-^\\dagger \\hat{a}_+ \\ , , \\",

    "the omission of these terms can certainly be justified in the special case when the intrinsic dissipation of the physical cavities are the same , i.e.  when @xmath256 , since @xmath257 in that case .",
    "a more general justification for omitting them is the assumption that @xmath75 is enhanced by external coupling to the effective mode @xmath78 ( see next section ) , such that @xmath258 .",
    "this means that the dissipative terms @xmath74 and @xmath255 will not play a major role as long as @xmath259 , which is a necessary assumption for the scheme to work anyway .",
    "thus , in the regime we are interested in , the terms proportional to @xmath255 play no significant role and we may neglect them .      the assumptions that @xmath57 and that @xmath260 are on the order of the original couplings @xmath261 means that @xmath262 .",

    ", are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "to achieve @xmath263 , we therefore need to increase @xmath75 by external coupling to the effective mode @xmath78 only . to model this ,",
    "let us assume that a third optical bath couples to the physical cavities @xmath51 and @xmath52 according to the hamiltonian @xmath264 this is similar to eq .  , but we have already assumed that the coupling strength is constant for the bath modes in the frequency range that contributes . for this third bath to effectively couple to the mode @xmath78 only , we need to assume that the couplings obey @xmath265 according to eqs .   and , this means that @xmath266 and that @xmath267 eq .",
    "simply states how strongly the physical cavities should couple to the third bath , whereas eq .",
    "is a requirement on the relative sign of the three couplings between cavity 1 , cavity 2 and the external bath .",
    "if for example the cavity - bath couplings are both positive , we must have @xmath268 .",
    "oppositely , if @xmath269 , the cavity - bath couplings must have opposite signs .",

    "we now perform the displacement transformations by defining @xmath278 with @xmath279 this gives the quantum master equation presented in the article , except for an additional term @xmath113 in the hamiltonian .",
    "this term will produce a nonzero expectation value of @xmath280 , which contradicts our assumption @xmath281 .",
    "the error stems from the fact that we defined @xmath56 without taking into account the average displacement of the oscillator due to the drive @xmath282 .",
