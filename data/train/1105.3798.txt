    "a superconducting qubit provides us with excellent controllability of the system for quantum information processing .",
    "coherent manipulations of superconducting qubits have already been demonstrated experimentally , and actually it is possible to perform a single qubit rotation within a few nano seconds by using a resonant microwave field @xcite . also , a high fidelity single qubit measurement has already been achieved with existing technology @xcite .",
    "specifically , a method using a josephson bifurcation amplifier ( jba ) @xcite has been used experimentally to perform a non - destructive measurement on the superconducting qubit . however , the coherence time of the superconducting qubit is usually relatively short where the typical dephasing time is of the order of a microsecond at the optimal point and becomes tens of nanoseconds far from the optimal point @xcite .",
    "recently , to overcome the problem of the short coherence time , a hybrid approach has been suggested that one can use another physical system as a quantum memory .",
    "it is known that a superconducting qubit could potentially provide a memory qubit if the lifetime could be increased .",
    "the control and the measurement setup used for the superconducting qubit , however , induces decoherence , and so there is a trade off relationship between efficient control and a long coherence time @xcite .",
    "this means that , by sacrificing controllability , it would be possible to have a much longer coherence time for a memory superconducting qubit @xcite . by combining a superconducting qubit with excellent controllability and another superconducting qubit with a long coherence time",
    ", we can construct a hybrid system to take advantage of both characteristics .",
    "another example is a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting qubit and a microwave cavity .",
    "strong coupling has been realized between the superconducting qubit and microwave cavity @xcite , which shows a possible application of a high q cavity as a quantum memory for storing the information .",
    "however , in this paper , we that such hybrid systems composed of a superconducting qubit and a memory qubit have a potential error caused by unwanted energy leakage from the memory qubit . transfer the quantum information to the memory , we have to tune the energy of the superconducting qubit on resonance with the memory qubit , and then it becomes possible to swap the information from the controllable qubit to the memory qubit .",
    "importantly , the superconducting qubit is usually affected by severe dephasing @xcite , and this induces an incoherent energy from the memory qubit to the superconducting qubit during information storage . , and this phenomenon can be understood as an occurrence of anti - zeno effect for quantum transport @xcite . with reasonable experimental parameters , we the actual lifetime of the memory qubit , and this turns out to be much shorter than the previously expected lifetime of the memory qubits @xcite .",
    "we will suggest possible ways to avoid such an energy relaxation process , which is feasible with current technology .",
    "let us study the unexpected relaxation of the memory qubit shown in fig .",
    "[ antizeno - schema ] quantitatively .",
    "although such relaxation behavior has been studied by @xcite in an anti zeno context for quantum energy transport , we introduce a simpler solvable model and we derive an analytical form of the energy relaxation time of the memory qubit . to describe the coupling between the superconducting qubit and the memory qubit , we use the following hamiltonian called the jaynes - cummings model or the tavis - cummings model @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) denotes the energy of the superconducting qubit ( memory qubit ) and @xmath3 denotes the coupling strength of the interaction .",
    "since we can change the energy of the superconducting qubit , it is possible to detune the energy between qubits when keeping the information stored in the memory . in this paper",
    ", @xmath4 denotes detuning during such a storage .",
    "we choose the initial state as @xmath5 to represent the storage of the excitation in the memory qubit .",
    "note that , since the hamiltonian conserves the total number of the excitation , the bases taken into account are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as long as we consider only the dephasing of the superconducting qubit as the decoherence source .",
    "also , it is worth mentioning that , throughout this paper , we assume that the memory qubit is coupled only with the superconducting qubit and has no direct interaction with the environment .",
    "the assumption here is valid as long as the lifetime of the memory qubit is much longer than that of a superconducting qubit . to obtain an analytical solution of the dynamics under the effect of the dephasing",
    ", we adopt a simple model where the system is affected by the unitary operation and the decoherence alternatively , so that we can obtain a recursion equation as @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath9 denotes the density matrix of the system at time @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the dephasing process , and @xmath12 denotes a period during the unitary operation .",
    "the time @xmath12 is comparable to the dephasing time @xmath13 of the superconducting qubit such as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a fitting parameter , the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix become small .",
    "so we consider the superoperator @xmath16 to be a non - selective measurement process for removing out the off - diagonal terms as follows ; @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the projection operator to a state @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) . under this approximation , the mixed state after performing this superoperator @xmath16",
    "should be described as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the population of each state .",
    "so we obtain the recursion equations as follows : @xmath25 by solving these equations with the initial condition of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we obtain @xmath28 where we use a rotating wave approximation such that @xmath29 should vanish due to the high frequency oscillation .",
    "we define the effective relaxation time induced by this anti zeno effect as the time at which the population of the excitation of the memory becomes @xmath30 .",
    "so we can calculate this effective relaxation time as @xmath31 although the energy relaxation to be exponentially small for a large detuning , the effective relaxation time of the memory is only quadratically dependent on detuning .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 is limited by the dephasing time of the superconducting qubit .",
    "regardless of the interpretation of the enhanced relaxation of the memory qubit ,    it is worth mentioning that this incoherent energy relaxation is much more severe than the well known errors caused by the dispersive hamiltonian . without decoherence",
    ", the hamiltonian between the superconducting qubit and the memory qubit can be represented as a dispersive form @xmath33 for a large detuning @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we tune the superconducting qubit so that it is on resonant with a third party system such as another qubit for information operations , the superconducting qubit in a superposition state induces phase errors in the detuned memory qubit .",
    "the error rate is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the time required for information operations on the third system .",
    "fortunately , such information operations can be performed in tens of nanoseconds and so this kind of phase error can be small .",
    "moreover , as long as the superconducting qubit is detuned from any other qubits , the effect of the dispersive hamiltonian on the memory qubit can be negligible by polarizing the superconducting qubit into the ground state .",
    "these results seem to show the suitability of this scheme for the long - term storage of information . however , as we have shown above , this naive illustration is no longer valid when we the effect of the dephasing from the environment . in fact , incoherent energy relaxation via the anti zeno effect occurs whenever the information is stored in the memory qubit . in spite of the fact that the memory qubit is assumed to retain the information for a long period , the information continues to leak during the storage and so the total error accumulation will be significant when we try to the information in the memory after such a storage .",
    "we have obtained an analytical formula for the effective relaxation time of the memory qubit with some approximation .",
    "it is possible to obtain a more rigorous result by solving a lindblad master equation numerically .",
    "so we adopt @xmath36-\\frac{1}{2t^{(\\text{sc})}_2}[\\hat{\\sigma     } ^{(\\text{sc})}_z,[\\hat{\\sigma } ^{(\\text{sc})}_z , \\rho ] ] $ ] as the master equation we have plotted the effective relaxation time of the memory qubit from the numerical solution in fig .",
    "[ compare - graph ] .",
    "the numerical solution shows the quadratic dependency of @xmath37 on the detuning , by fitting the analytical result with this numerical result , we obtain @xmath38 and we also plot the analytical result in fig .",
    "[ compare - graph ] .",
    "ns for the dephasing time of the superconducting qubit and at @xmath39 mhz for the coupling strength between the qubits .",
    "these results show that the relaxation time is quadratically dependent on the energy detuning .",
    ", width=7 ]    the behavior of our analytical solution matches the numerical solutions , and this shows the validity of our approximation .",
    "surprisingly , even for a large detuning such as @xmath40 , the relaxation time is just a few microseconds .",
    "since a typical memory qubit is considered to have a long lifetime of , for example , tens of milliseconds @xcite , this result shows that the actual relaxation time induced by imperfect decoupling is much shorter than previously expected .",
    "a superconducting qubit can be affected by both dephasing and relaxation . to model both the dephasing and relaxation on the superconducting qubit",
    ", we add a relaxation term to the lindblad master equation and we adopt the following master equation @xmath41-\\frac{1}{2t^{(\\text{sc})}_2}[\\hat{\\sigma     } ^{(\\text{sc})}_z,[\\hat{\\sigma } ^{(\\text{sc})}_z , \\rho ] ]    -\\frac{1}{2t^{(sc)}_1}(\\hat{\\sigma } ^{(\\text{sc})}_+\\hat{\\sigma     } ^{(\\text{sc})}_-\\rho + \\rho \\hat{\\sigma } ^{(\\text{sc})}_+ \\hat{\\sigma     } ^{(\\text{sc})}_- -\\hat{\\sigma } ^{(\\text{sc})}_-\\rho \\hat{\\sigma } ^{(\\text{sc})}_+)$ ] where @xmath42 denotes the relaxation time of a superconducting qubit . by solving this master equation numerically , we are able to plot the population decay behavior of the memory qubit fig .",
    "[ popualtion - graph ] .     mhz . from the bottom , we plot a numerical result with @xmath43 ns and @xmath44 ns , a numerical result with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and a numerical result with @xmath46 and @xmath47 ns .",
    ", width=302 ]    , the population of the memory qubit decays to half of the initial population while the population decays to zero under the effect of the relaxation on the superconducting qubit . from the numerical solution , we plot @xmath32 as a function of @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ 2compare - graph ] .",
    "ns and the coupling constant between qubits at @xmath39 mhz .",
    "the lowest line is that where the detuning @xmath49 is @xmath50 mhz , and the other lines are where @xmath51 mhz respectively .",
    ", width=321 ]    even for a long dephasing time and huge detuning such as @xmath52 ns and @xmath53 , the effective relaxation time @xmath32 is around @xmath54 @xmath55s , which is much shorter than the typical lifetime of the memory qubit @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results show that the standard strategy to detune the superconducting qubit with the memory qubit actually fails due to the energy leakage from the memory qubit during the storage of the information .",
    "finally , we discuss possible solutions to the problem of the energy relaxation caused by the anti zeno effect . when one uses an ensemble composed of @xmath56 @xmath57 spins as a memory qubit , the excitation of the superconducting qubit is transferred to the ensemble and stored as a collective mode . a state with a single collective mode in the ensemble",
    "is represented as @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the raising operator of a spin and @xmath60 denotes the ground state of a single spin .",
    "so our purpose here is to decouple this excitation in the ensemble from the superconducting qubit . to achieve this",
    ", we can apply a magnetic field gradient @xmath61 ( t / m ) with some time duration to the state @xmath62 of the ensemble so that we obtain the state @xmath63 . here",
    ", we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the magnetic moment of the spin , @xmath12 denotes application time of such a field gradient , and @xmath66 denotes the distance between the spins .",
    "since we have @xmath67 , the state @xmath68 becomes orthogonal with the state @xmath62 for @xmath69 , and therefore we can decouple the ensemble from the superconducting qubit . for reasonable parameters such as @xmath70 ghz / t for the zeeman splitting and @xmath71 @xmath65 m for the ensemble length , we need a field gradient @xmath72 t / m to achieve the orthogonal state in hundreds of nanoseconds .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the indirect energy relaxation in a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting qubit and a memory qubit .",
    "our model is quite general , and therefore the results reported here can be applied to many systems .",
