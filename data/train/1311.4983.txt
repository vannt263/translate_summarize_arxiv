    "the recent discovery of superconductivity with t@xmath2 of 18 k in potassium doped picene ( c@xmath3h@xmath4 )  @xcite has attracted great attention on the aromatic superconductor , a new class of organic superconductor , which was formed by intercalating alkali metal atoms into the interstitial space between aromatic molecules in the molecular crystal .",
    "subsequently , alkali metal doped phenanthrene ( c@xmath5h@xmath6 )  @xcite and dibenzopentacene ( c@xmath7h@xmath8 )  @xcite with superconducting transition temperature of t@xmath2 = 5.6  k and 33  k were reported , respectively . in the three kinds of superconductors ,",
    "the electronic charges are transferred from the doped metal atoms to aromatic molecules and delocalized throughout the molecular crystal .",
    "apart from alkali metal , alkaline earth and rare earth metal are also adopted to synthesize metal - doped phenanthrene crystal to explore their superconductivity . in experiment ,",
    "the high quality ba@xmath9phenanthrene  @xcite and la@xmath0phenanthrene  @xcite superconductors were obtained with superconducting shielding fractions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and for la@xmath0phenanthrene , the superconducting transition temperature significantly increases with the pressure and sustains high t@xmath2 in a wide range of pressure  @xcite .",
    "the determination of crystal structure of metal doped picene , phenanthrene , and dibenzopentacene is an important prerequisite to understand the electronic behavior and superconducting mechanism in the aromatic superconductors .",
    "however , the detailed crystal structures of doped materials have not yet been reported in experiment , especially the metal atomic position , due to the degradation of sample in air and the limit of measurement techniques  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical groups have devoted to the researches on the crystal and electronic properties  @xcite . for exmaple , kosugi  _ et al .",
    "_ systematically investigated the crystal structure of k - doped picene with different k concentrations , and found that multiple structures exist at the same k concentration ; andres  _ et al .",
    "_ fully optimized the geometries of k@xmath12picene and acquired two distinct structures , one with a herringbone structure and the other with a laminar structure . for tripotassium - intercalated phenanthrene",
    ", there also exist the great discrepancy between the optimized structure and the measured one  @xcite .",
    "other theoretical researches on the electronic correlation effect and magnetism of k@xmath12picene were also performed and the lattice parameters were fixed at the measured values  @xcite in their first principle calculations .",
    "we notice that van der waals interactions have not been taken into account in previous theoretical studies .",
    "the organic compounds of picene , phenanthrene , and dibenzopentacene are the typical molecular crystals , which have low density and hardness because of the light element and relatively long intermolecular bonds . in these materials ,",
    "van der waals interactions existing among molecules play a key role in determining the intermolecular distance and the stacking pattern .",
    "therefore , it is quite necessary to include this factor in simulation of the structural and electronic properties of metal - doped picene , phenanthrene , and dibenzopentacene superconductors .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the structural and electronic properties of rare earth metal la doped phenanthrene , which became a valuable research issue because of the following reasons .",
    "firstly , potassium is an alkali metal element with one electron in the outermost shell . due to the high metal reactivity ,",
    "potassium is usually used to intercalate into graphite , c@xmath13 , phenanthrene , picene , and dibenzopentacene to induce superconductivity .",
    "lanthanum belongs to rare earth metal with an electron configuration [ xe]5d@xmath146s@xmath15 and exhibits two oxidation states , + 3 and + 2 in general .",
    "the metal reactivity of lanthanum is much lower than potassium in the reactivity series of metal . because of such difference",
    ", a large discrepancy relative to k - doped phenanthrene can be expected in la - doped phenanthrene . secondly , the recent report from x. j. chen group indicated that la - doped phenanthrene displays a significant positive pressure effect of t@xmath2 and a sustainable high critical temperature within a wide pressure range , which are unique superconducting features different from k - doped phenanthrene  @xcite .",

    "the projector augmented - wave method ( paw ) pseudopotentials were used to model the electron - ion interactions .",

    "the semilocal - density approximation - gga works well for inhomogeneous systems , for example , transition metals , ionic crystals , compound metals , surfaces , interfaces , and some chemical systems .",
    "however , for sparse systems , including soft matter , van der waals complexes , and biomolecules , they have inter - particle separations , for which nonlocal , long - ranged interactions , such as van der waals ( vdw ) forces , are influential .",

    "@xmath20 is the nonlocal energy term which accounts approximately for the nonlocal electron correlation effects .",
    "the vdw - df method greatly improves the interaction energies of dispersion bonded systems @xcite , and its application to hard solid can also obtain a systematic improvement in atomization energy and cohesive properties @xcite .",
    "the gaussian broadening technique was employed and a mesh of @xmath21 k - points were sampled for the brillouin - zone integration .",
    "after the full convergency test , the kinetic energy cut - off and the charge density cut - off of the plane wave basis were chosen to be 80 ry and 600 ry , respectively . in our calculations , the lattice parameters were firstly fixed at the experimental values and the internal atomic coordinates were optimized by the energy minimization .",
    "the variable unit cell calculations were performed to compare with the results in the case of fixed lattice constants .",

    "the dispersion of bands along @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( parallel to the axis @xmath43 in the brillouin zone ) is small , which is related to the weak interlayer coupling mediated by h - h overlap . in the direction of axis @xmath30 ,",
    "the la atoms and molecules are stacked most closely because of the short axis @xmath30 , which is reflected in the stronger dispersion of bands along @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( parallel to the axis @xmath47 ) .",
    "compared with the band structure of k@xmath12phenanthrene in the lower panel of fig.2 in andres paper @xcite , the total width of two bands crossing the fermi level is about 0.8 ev for la@xmath0phenanthrene , which is larger than 0.5 ev in the k doped case .",
    "in addition , the two bands below the fermi level locate around -1.0 ev for la@xmath0phenanthrene , lower than -0.5 ev in k@xmath12phenanthrene .",

    "<S> by the first principles calculations based on the van der waals density functional theory , we study the crystal structures and electronic properties of la - doped phenanthrene . </S>",
    "<S> two stable atomic geometries of la@xmath0phenanthrene are obtained by relaxation of atomic positions from various initial structures . </S>",
    "<S> the structure- is a metal with two energy bands crossing the fermi level , while the structure- displays a semiconducting state with an energy gap of 0.15 ev , which has an energy gain of 0.42 ev per unit cell compared to the structure- . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking feature of la@xmath0phenanthrene is that la @xmath1 electrons make a significant contribution to the total density of state ( dos ) around the fermi level , which is distinct from potassium doped phenanthrene and picene . </S>",
    "<S> our findings provide an important foundation for the understanding of superconductivity in la - doped phenanthrene . </S>"
