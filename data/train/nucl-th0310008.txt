    "the standard model ( sm ) for electroweak and strong interactions of elementary particles allows for precise theoretical predictions that are in remarkable agreement with present experimental results from high - energy experiments .",
    "however , an explanation of the sm and its parameters within a more fundamental theoretical framework remains an unresolved puzzle .",
    "many questions in this respect ( e.g.  a grand unification of forces and matter , the origin of neutrino masses and its relation to the quark sector , the origin of @xmath1 violation , etc . ) are related to the flavour sector of the sm , i.e.to the masses and coupling constants of the different quark and lepton species .",
    "@xmath0-meson decays are particularly useful to explore the parameters of the flavour sector in the sm or possible extensions of it .",

    "hopes to reveal indirect effects from physics beyond the sm even before the direct detection of new particles .    from the qcd point of view , @xmath2 quarks are interesting because they are the heaviest quarks that build pronounced hadronic bound states .",
    "the fact that the @xmath2-quark mass ( @xmath3  gev ) is large with respect to typical hadronic scales leads to new approximate symmetries that can be observed in the @xmath2-hadron spectrum and decays .",
    "furthermore , the heavy - quark mass provides a scale at which the strong coupling constant is still small , and perturbative computations of short - distance effects are possible .",
    "the short - distance dynamics has to be separated from ( non - perturbative ) long - distance physics related to the intrinsic qcd scale @xmath4 . technically this is achieved by an operator product expansion and from an effective field theory approach , respectively . in this way",
    ", @xmath0-meson decays can also be used to test and improve our theoretical understanding of qcd in different dynamical regimes .",
    "in the sm , transitions between different quark flavours are mediated by charged @xmath5 bosons .",
    "the relative strengths @xmath6 for flavour transitions @xmath7 define the unitary cabbibo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which can be parametrized in terms of 3 real angles and one @xmath1-violating phase . on the other hand ,",

    "in contrast to the heavy - to - heavy case , the values of heavy - to - light form factors themselves are not restricted by a simple symmetry principle .",
    "often , one uses a simple parametrization , e.g.  for the relevant form factor for @xmath49 decays : @xmath50 where the first term in the denominator reflects the fact that for @xmath51 the form factor is dominated by the nearest vector - meson pole , and @xmath52@xmath53 and @xmath54@xmath55 are fitted to lattice , qcd sum rules , or model estimates @xcite . with increasing experimental data on the exclusive decay spectra , which would also help to test and refine different model estimates , significant improvement is expected for the determination of @xmath47 from @xmath49 and @xmath56 decays .",
    "currently , the result for @xmath47 from exclusive decays is somewhat smaller than the result from the inclusive analysis ( but compatible within the rather large uncertainties ) @xcite .",
    "other exclusive @xmath0 decays into light mesons require additional non - perturbative input , as soon as radiative qcd corrections are considered .",
    "the first systematic treatment of this issue has been discussed in @xcite for the case of non - leptonic @xmath57 decays .",
    "it has been shown that ( to leading order in the @xmath58 expansion and including first - order @xmath59 corrections ) the decay amplitude can be factorized into perturbative short - distance coefficient functions and non - perturbative matrix elements that define heavy - to - light transition form factors , or light - cone distribution amplitudes for @xmath0 mesons and pions .",
    "comparison with experimental data from @xmath57 and @xmath60 decays gives additional constraints on the ckm triangle ( with some uncertainties coming from the parametrization of the @xmath0-meson distribution amplitude and from estimating @xmath58 corrections ) .",
    "the different energy scales relevant to @xmath0-meson decays imply that different dynamical aspects of qcd are probed : at the electroweak scale amplitudes are sensitive to the parameters that describe flavour transitions in the standard model or its possible extensions .",
    "perturbative qcd corrections are included by matching the full theory onto an effective hamiltonian and evolving the corresponding wilson coefficients to scales of the order of the heavy - quark mass . at this scale , strong interactions are still perturbative .",
    "furthermore , hadronic matrix elements can be expanded in inverse powers of the heavy - quark mass .",
    "this is formally described in terms of heavy quark effective theory ( for @xmath2 decays into charm quarks or low - energetic light quarks and gluons ) , of soft - collinear effective theory ( for decays into energetic light quarks and gluons ) .",
    "finally , the non - perturbative dynamics related to the intrinsic qcd scale is described in terms of hadronic parameters that have to be extracted from experiment or estimated from lattice , qcd sum rules or models .",
    "reducing the theoretical uncertainties from each of the above dynamical regimes , and comparing the results with experimental data from @xmath0 factories , enables us to test the flavour sector of the standard model , to find or constrain indirect new physics contributions , and to improve our understanding of perturbative and non - perturbative qcd .",
