    "the sde models the movement of @xmath0 particles as interacting brownian motions such that at every time point , if we order the positions of the particles , then the @xmath7th ranked particle from the top gets a drift @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "as time evolves , the brownian motions switch ranks and drifts , and hence their motion is determined by such time dependent interactions . such processes ( or close relatives )",
    "have been considered recently in several articles .",
    "we consider three major veins in the literature where these processes make their appearance .    *",
    "1 . stochastic portfolio theory .",
    "* a detailed study of the solutions of sde in general was taken up in a paper by banner , fernholz , and karatzas ( bfk ) @xcite .",
    "these authors actually consider a more general class of sdes than in which the drifts as well as the volatilities of the different brownian motions depend on their ranks . using a delicate and elegant analysis of the local time of intersections of the different brownian motions , the authors were able to demonstrate various ergodic properties of such processes . an important object in their study is the vector of _ spacings _ in the ordered process :",
    "@xmath10 under suitable sufficient conditions the authors proved that the marginal distributions of the spacings converge to exponential laws and left the question of joint convergence open .",
    "the joint law was identified and the bfk conditions were shown to be necessary and sufficient in pal and pitman @xcite ( see theorem [ theoremn ] below for the statement of the pal - pitman result ) .    * 2 .",
    "burgers , mckean - vlasov , and the granular media equations . * sznitman in his articles on the propagation of chaos , @xcite and @xcite , considers @xmath0 brownian motions arranged in decreasing order .",
    "he proves that the ordered process can be thought of as a multidimensional brownian motion reflected in the orthant @xmath11 and discusses its relation with the solution of the burgers equation . for more details on reflected brownian motions in an orthant ,",
    "see varadhan and williams @xcite and williams @xcite . for",
    "more on stochastic particle system methods in analyzing burgers equation , see calderoni and pulvirenti @xcite .",
    "note that the drifts in sde at any time point are a function of the empirical cumulative distribution function induced by the @xmath0 brownian particles on the line .",
    "in stochastic models related to mckean - vlasov and the granular media pde , the empirical cdf , for large @xmath0 , is an approximation to a single probability measure ( depending on t ) .",
    "thus , and similar systems often appear as approximations to sdes whose drifts and volatilities depend on the marginal distribution of the particles . for example , in the context of mckean - vlasov type equations , see bossy and talay @xcite and the recent article by bolley , guillin , and villani @xcite . for the granular media equation ,",

    "arratia in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) observes that instead of brownian motion , if one considers the exclusion process associated with the nearest neighbor random walk on @xmath14 , then the corresponding stationary system of spacings between particles can be interpreted as a finite or infinite series of queues .",

    "the article by pal and pitman @xcite considers solutions of sde as their central object of study .",
    "the number @xmath0 can either be finite or countably infinite .",
    "they show the existence of a weak solution for sde and the uniqueness in law ( see lemma 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the major results in the paper is a necessary and sufficient condition on the sequence @xmath15 such that the law of the spacing vector @xmath16 converges in total variation to a unique stationary distribution as time goes to infinity .",
    "we would like to caution that @xcite uses the order statistic notation in which @xmath17 while describing sde , which is the reverse of the notation we found to be the most suitable for this paper .",

    "moreover , the spacings system is reversible at equilibrium .",
    "_ the necessity of condition is hinted by the following localization argument : for every @xmath30 , one divides the collection of @xmath0 particles as the top @xmath30 particles and the bottom @xmath31 particles .",
    "if the entire collection has to remain together , the average drift of the top @xmath30 particles must be less than than the average drift of the bottom @xmath31 .",

    "now suppose we have a triangular array of drifts @xmath32 , such that for every @xmath0 the vector @xmath33 satisfies condition  .",
    "note that the market weights are purely a function of the spacings , and thus have an induced stationary measure for every @xmath0 .",
    "thinking of the market weights under this stationary measure as a random point process in @xmath34 $ ] , we are interested in the limit law of this point process as we take @xmath0 to infinity .",
    "it turns out that any non - trivial limit law is a poisson - dirichlet distribution under ` universal conditions ' , and exhibits phase transitions .",

    "condition is the ` continuity at the edge ' condition mentioned in the abstract .",
    "it means that the top few particles get almost the same drift .",
    "this is a weaker version of a general continuity condition that would demand that whenever two particles have almost the same rank , they would get almost the same drifts .",
    "the condition can be understood as saying that the highest ranked particles get the minimum drifts , in a limiting sense .",
    "although the conditions seem to be reasonable , it is still surprising that the conditions are also sharp , in the sense that poisson - dirichlet convergence may fail if either or fails to hold as shown by the counterexamples in section [ examples ] .",
    "finally we would like to mention that the two degenerate limits can be seen as limits of the poisson - dirichlet laws as the parameter @xmath50 tends to zero or one .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ bfkmodels ] discusses the implications of the convergence to poisson - dirichlet law for the banner - fernholz - karatzas models of equity markets .",
    "in particular , we compute the asymptotic laws of certain functionals of the market weights by resorting to similar computations for the poisson - dirichlet law .",
    "they include the expected _ market entropy _ @xmath68 and the expected @xmath69th moment @xmath70 .",
    "both these functions are considered in stochastic portfolio theory as measures of _ market diversity _",
    "( see @xcite ) . in section [ pp ]",
    ", we introduce the poisson - dirichlet law and discuss its relation with certain poisson processes on the real line .",
    "section [ triangle ] contains proofs of all the major theorems in this paper",
    ". finally , in section [ examples ] , we discuss counterexamples demonstrating the tightness of the conditions in our theorems .",
    "fernholz in his 2002 book @xcite introduces solutions of to model the time dynamics of the logarithm of the market capitalizations of different companies in an equity market . in other words",
    ", he considers a stock market with @xmath0 companies whose total worth in stocks are coordinate - wise exponentials of the solution of equation .",
    "a major objective of his work is to explain the following curious empirical fact regarding what are known as the _ market weights_. the market weight of a company is defined to be the ratio of its market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all the companies , that is , the proportion of total market capital that belongs to a particular company .",
    "the market weight is a measure of the influence that the company exerts on the entire market and have been studied extensively in the economics literature over the decades for their peculiar structure and very stable behavior in time .",
    "for example see articles by hashemi @xcite , ijiri and simon @xcite , jovanovic @xcite , and simon and bonini @xcite .",
    "the structure in the market weights arises if one arranges the market weights data in decreasing order and plots their logarithms against the logarithm of their ranks .",
    "this log - log plot is referred to as the _ capital distribution curve_. for example , if we consider fernholz s model , and denote by @xmath71 a solution of sde , the ordered market weights are given by the transformation @xmath72 the capital distribution curve will then be a plot of @xmath73 versus @xmath74 .",
    "empirically this plot exhibits nearly polynomial decay with decreasing ranks .",
    "see figure 1 below ( reproduced from @xcite ) which shows capital distribution curves between 1929 and 1999 for all the major us stock markets ( nyse , amex , and nasdaq ) combined .",
    "to explain this fact , fernholz considers a special case of called the _ atlas model _ where @xmath75 , and @xmath13 for all @xmath76 .",
    "he conjectured that the capital distribution curve obtained from the diffusion satisfying the sde for the atlas model converges to a stationary distribution under which it is roughly a straight line .",
    "it is interesting to note that the phase transition phenomenon described in theorem [ mainthmdrift ] predicts some remarkable outcomes about models of stock market capitalizations as given in banner , fernholz , and karatzas @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , it is empirically observed that the companies with the few largest market weights get the least drift , and most movement seems to come from the bottom of the pile .",
    "this validates both our assumptions about the drift sequences made in and .",
    "hence our results show the following universality property of the bfk models .",
    "when the number of companies in the market is large , one of the following must happen , either , the market share of each company is negligible with respect to the entire market , or the emergence of a superpower which dominates the market , or a delicate equilibrium under which the market weights are arranged as a particular realization of a poisson - dirichlet process .",
    "these conclusions hold , no matter what specifically the values of the drifts are , as long as conditions and are satisfied .",
    "the atoms of poisson - dirichlet are well - known to decay polynomially ( the slope of the log - log plot for pd@xmath77 being roughly @xmath78 ) which validates fernholz s conjecture .",
    "the atlas model ( @xcite ) is an example where such a phase transition takes place .",
    "* example . * consider the atlas model with @xmath0 particles ( @xcite , @xcite ) : for @xmath9 , let @xmath79 where @xmath39 is an @xmath0-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "the drift sequence is clearly given by @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 , and the drift sequence satisfies condition : @xmath84 thus , by theorem [ theoremn ] , there is a unique stationary distribution under which the spacings @xmath85 are independent exponential random variables with rates @xmath86 . also , note that if @xmath87 exists in @xmath88 $ ] , then @xmath89 let @xmath90 be the stationary law of the spacing system in an @xmath0-particle atlas model .",
    "it follows from theorem [ mainthmdrift ] that as @xmath0 tends to infinity , the point process of market weights under @xmath90 either converges to a non - degenrate pd distribution , or to one of the two degenerate limit depending on the value of @xmath91 .",
    "since the atoms of the poisson - dirichlet laws have polynomial decay , the atlas model fits into the observed data in figure 1 .",
    "moreover , the drift sequence trivially satisfies the lipschitz condition in theorem [ phasegrav ] for @xmath92 .",
    "hence , when @xmath64 the market weights go to zero at a polynomial rate .",
    "finally , suppose @xmath93 then , the market weights go to zero at a logarithmic rate .",
    "in particular , this happens if @xmath94 .",
    "we introduce another model , the _ one - dimensional gravity model _ , which satisfies such a transition .",
    "* example . * for a parameter sequence @xmath95 , let @xmath96 here @xmath97 is an @xmath0-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that sde is a particular case of where the drift that the @xmath7th ranked particle gets is @xmath98 .",
    "the more striking property of this model is the mutual attraction between particles which is due to the one - dimensional gravitational force kernel sign(@xmath99 ) .",
    "one can think of the parameter @xmath100 as the strength of gravitational pull between the particles .",
    "note that the average drift for the gravity model is zero by symmetry .",
    "moreover , the drift sequence satisfies condition : @xmath101 which is positive for all @xmath102 .",
    "thus , from theorem [ theoremn ] , it follows that there is a unique stationary measure for the spacings @xmath103 under which the coordinates are independent and the @xmath7th spacing is distributed as exponential with rate @xmath86 .",
    "now , suppose that @xmath104 exists in @xmath88 $ ] . then note that @xmath105 thus , the gravity model satisfies conditions , for theorem [ mainthmdrift ] .",
    "additionally , it follows that @xmath106 for some constant @xmath107 depending on @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the gravity model also satisfies condition for theorem [ phasegrav ] .",
    "we can thus conclude that all the conclusions of phase transition in theorems [ mainthmdrift ] and [ phasegrav ] hold for the gravity model as @xmath91 varies from zero to infinity .",
    "the limiting poisson - dirichlet law helps us to compute asymptotic laws of functions of the market weights under stationary distribution .",
    "various distributional properties of pd(@xmath108 ) , @xmath109 , have been studied extensively , and we only use the most important ones for our purpose here .",
    "many more identities together with their various applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "the following theorem , whose proof can be found in section [ triangle ] , is a typical example of how such properties can be put to use in the context of bfk models .",
    "[ benefits ] for every @xmath110 , consider the solution of the sde with a drift sequence @xmath111 .",
    "assume that the array of drifts satisfies conditions of theorem [ theoremn ] , and and of theorem [ mainthmdrift ] with @xmath112 .",
    "we have the following conclusions .",
    "\\(i ) the asymptotic moments of the maximum market weight @xmath54 under the stationary law is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "in particular , this determines the asymptotic law of the highest market weight .",

    "then the asymptotic expectation of @xmath117 is given by @xmath118    \\(iii ) define the market entropy @xmath119 .",
    "in this section we introduce the poisson - dirichlet law of random point processes and discuss the notion of weak convergence on the underlying space .",
    "recall that a point process can be viewed as a random counting measure .",
    "for example , the poisson point process with a @xmath121-finite intensity measure @xmath122 , ppp(@xmath122 ) , is defined to be a random point measure with the following properties . for any collection of disjoint borel subsets @xmath123 of the real line satisfying @xmath124 for all @xmath7 , let @xmath125 be the number of elements of the ppp(@xmath122 ) that are contained in @xmath126 .",
    "then the coordinates of the random vector @xmath127 are independent and the @xmath7th coordinate is distributed as poisson(@xmath128 ) .",
    "if the random point process has a maximum atom almost surely , it is customary to order the atoms as a random decreasing sequence of real numbers .",
    "this happens , for example , when the intensity measure @xmath122 for ppp(@xmath122 ) is such that @xmath129 .    to discuss weak convergence of such random sequences",
    "it is necessary to define an underlying polish space .",
    "the separable complete metric space @xmath130 we use for this article is the space of all real decreasing sequences with the metric of pointwise convergence , i.e. , @xmath131 the fact that this is a polish space and other properties can be found in page 45 of  @xcite . from now on ,",
    "our point processes will be random sequences taking values in the state space @xmath130 .",
    "any finite sequences @xmath132 will correspond to an infinite sequence @xmath133 in @xmath130 .    here is a typical example of a point process which will be of use to us later on . consider a sequence of independent standard exponential random variables @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath135 be the decreasingly ordered rearrangement among the first @xmath0 values of the sequence .",
    "that is @xmath136    [ orderedexp ] the random point process @xmath137 , converges weakly to a poisson point process on the line with intensity @xmath138 .    convergence of the extreme order statistics of iid data to a poisson point process is a standard exercise in extreme value statistics .",
    "for example , see the book by resnick @xcite . in general , it follows from the fact that suppose , for every @xmath139 , @xmath140 are @xmath0 iid data with law @xmath141 .",
    "further assume that there is a measure @xmath122 such that @xmath142 for all borel subsets @xmath143 of @xmath144 .",
    "then the random point measure induced by the @xmath0 data points converge weakly to a poisson random measure with intensity @xmath122 .",
    "when the iid data comes from exponential@xmath145 distribution shifted by @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and this proves the lemma .",

    "the pd family is fundamental and comes up in several contexts .",
    "it can also be seen as a part of a wider two parameter family of laws . for an excellent survey of old and new results we suggest the article by pitman and yor @xcite .",

    "the difficulty in proving theorem [ iidexppd ] lies in the fact that it does not follow from the convergence of the numerators of @xmath167 to the poisson point process of lemma [ orderedexp ] .",
    "although poisson - dirichlet can be obtained from the limiting sequence as described by lemma [ exppd ] , the convergence of the point processes of the extreme statistics is in the sense of distributions which does not guarantee convergence of its sum or the ratio .",
