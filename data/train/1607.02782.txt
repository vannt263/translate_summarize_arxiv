    "the desire to create an optical directional coupler , a device composed by parallel optical waveguides close enough that leaked energy is transferred between them , led to the exploration of waveguide creation in semi - conductors via proton bombardment @xcite . at the time , power losses played an interesting role and the nascent mode coupling theory @xcite allowed the theoretical description of linear loses in such devices @xcite , @xmath2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the real numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the effective linear loss , identical in all implanted waveguides , and the effective waveguide coupling strength , also indentical for the whole system , in that order .",
    "this , to the best of our knowledge , was the first theoretical description of an experimental @xmath1-waveguide coupler including losses in the form of a schrdinger - like equation involving a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "almost twenty years later , the desire to create an intensity dependent switch working at low power levels took another team of researchers to explore twin core nonlinear couplers with gain and loss .",
    "again , coupled mode theory allowed the description of such devices @xcite , @xmath5 where we have kept the notation used before and introduce the effective real part of the refractive index , @xmath6 , and the real function @xmath7 that describes an effective kerr nonlinearity induced change in the refractive index of the @xmath8th core , positive for self - focusing and negative for self - defocusing materials . at this point in history , there existed experimental and theoretical work describing an optical dimer where the waveguides present effective loss and gain and a nonlinearity but a little something was missing .",
    "a couple of years later , a theory exploring a particular type of non - hermitian hamiltonians with real spectra was brought forward in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "these hamiltonians were invariant under space - time reflection , received the name of @xmath0-symmetric , and opened new avenues of research in quantum mechanics as well as other areas of physics and matemathics , c.f . @xcite and references therein .    in optics",
    ", it took a few years more to propose two seminal ideas .",
    "the first one regarded single elements and showed , in particular , that an optical planar slab waveguide composed of two media with linear gain and loss can be described by a schrdinger - like equation under dynamics dictated by a @xmath9-symmetric hamiltonian , where the optical refractive index played the role of quantum - like potential and propagation distance that of time @xcite .",
    "the second one dealt with composite systems , where a mature mode coupling theory produced a theory of coupled optical pt - symmetric structures @xcite .",
    "in the ten years following those first proposals for an optical realization of @xmath9-symmetry , work has been reported on slab waveguides @xcite , bragg scatterers @xcite , as well as linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite coupled waveguides , to mention just a few .",
    "research in this field is slowly getting to information technologies applications with recent proposals of all - optical @xmath0-symmetric logic gates @xcite and amplitude - to - phase converters @xcite .    here",
    ", we will provide a review of the optical @xmath0-symmetric dimer .",
    "first , in section 2 , we will introduce a two - waveguide coupler where component waveguides show effective complex refractive indices with identical real part .",
    "starting from this device , we will recover the effective mode coupling differential equation set for the linear @xmath0-symmetric dimer , which describes a nonunitary optical device showing symmetric effective loss and gain feasible of passive and active optical realizations .",
    "then , we will recover the dispersion relation for the dimer that shows three regimes , one with real eigenvalues , the @xmath0-symmetric regime , another with fully degenerate eigenvalues equal to zero , the fully degenerate regime , and a third one with purely imaginary eigenvalues , the broken symmetry regime .",
    "we will construct an analytic propagator that will show asymmetric amplifying oscillator , power amplification , and exponential amplification behaviors in each of these regimes .",
    "we will also show that it is possible to uncouple the mode coupling differential equation set of the @xmath0-symmetric dimer .",
    "the resulting second order differential equations and boundary conditions for the field amplitudes propagating through each waveguides take the form of nonlocal oscillators with positive potential , free particle traveling through a nonlocal medium , and nonlocal oscillators with inverted potential , in each of the regimes . in the final part of section 2 , we will bring forward the renormalized field approach that helps us cast the linear @xmath0-symmetric dimer as a nonlinear dimer with imaginary kerr nonlinearity , either in a self- or a cross - modulation scheme , and allows us to realize an asymptotic behavior that depends just on the gain to coupling strength ratio of the device . in section 3 , we will discuss the linear @xmath0-symmetric dimer when both waveguides show the same effective self - focusing kerr nonlinearity .",
    "we will show the stable nonlinear modes of the device , discuss its dynamics in terms of the passive kerr two - waveguide coupler that allows for coherent and localized oscillations between the waveguide field modes , and show that the inclusion of symmetric gain and loss breaks these dynamics producing localization in the gain waveguide without showing an asymptotic behavior . in section 4",
    ", we will extend the linear @xmath0-symmetric dimer to planar @xmath1-waveguide couplers using finite dimensional matrix representations of a complexified version of @xmath10 .",
    "we have previously shown @xcite that the @xmath0-symmetric dimer and its extensions to planar @xmath1-waveguide couplers possess an @xmath11 symmetry realized in a finite dimensional non - unitary irreducible representation .",
    "this representation is accomplished through complexification of @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and it allows us to provide the dispersion relation and a closed form analytic propagator , which have the same regimes and dynamics found for the dimer .",
    "we will show that the renormalized field approach provides us with an asymptotic behavior that is independent of the initial field distribution and depends just on the waveguide number and the effective gain to coupling ratio .",
    "then , in section 5 , we will introduce a modified version of the ehrenfest theorem suitable for non - hermitian hamiltonians and show how it can help us define the dynamics of an @xmath13-dimensional generalized stokes vector for the planar @xmath1-waveguide couplers discussed in section 4 . in section 6 , we will go back to the dimer but consider the propagation of quantum fields . in the quantum regime , spontaneous generation and absorption of electromagnetic radiation",
    "should be considered when using media with linear gain or loss .",
    "we will show the solution for the quantum linear @xmath0-symmetric dimer and discuss the generation of light from vacuum due to spontaneous processes in the absence of fields impinging at the device .",
    "finally , we will produce a brief summary and discuss future avenues regarding non - hermitian optical systems .",
    "a two - waveguide coupler can be described by the following differential equation system via mode coupling theory , @xmath14 where the complex numbers @xmath15 are the field amplitudes at each waveguide , the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which in the most general case can be complex , are the effective refractive indices and waveguide coupling , in that order , and the operator @xmath18 stands for the derivative with respect to the propagation distance @xmath19 .",

    "they are purely imaginary for @xmath27 and @xmath28 and , finally , complex elsewhere .",
    "this general non - hermitian dimer has a rich structure that deserves further attention but , right now , we are interested in just the @xmath0-symmetric case .    in quantum mechanics , pt - symmetry refers to space - time reflection symmetry @xcite . in discrete optical couplers we can consider waveguide permutation and propagation inversion as equivalent to space and time reflection , respectively .",
    "then , in order to recover the standard linear @xmath9-symmetric dimer , we need to work with waveguides that have the same effective refractive indices , @xmath29 such that @xmath30 is purely imaginary and we can write a differential set @xcite , @xmath31 where permutation of the waveguides , @xmath32 , and propagation reversal , @xmath33 , leaves the system invariant . note that we have used the effective coupling parameter to scale the propagation distance , @xmath34 , such that we deal with a single parameter given by the effective refractive index to coupling ratio , @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
