    "symmetries and killing vectors play an important role in exact solutions , especially in the electro vacuum ones e.g. @xcite .",
    "a general plane symmetric metrics in cylindrical coordinates is taken as a seed solution @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are arbitrary functions of coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    the generating conjecture , formulated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , is applied to azimuthal @xmath6 killing vector belonging to rotation in planes of symmetry .",
    "components of this killing vector are @xmath7    expected form of `` charged '' metrics is again the general plane symmetric metrics @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions different from ( [ seed ] ) and they will be evaluated out of the einstein - maxwell equations . according to the conjecture we can form an electro - magnetic potential from killing vector @xmath12",
    "if we use the electro - magnetic potential ( [ pot ] ) for purely electro - magnetic energy - momentum tensor , two einstein equations @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the space - time ( [ newm ] ) are @xmath15 these lead to the restrictions on function @xmath2 in seed metric ( [ sedm ] ) @xmath16    then the maxwell equations for ( [ newm ] ) are automatically satisfied , the nonzero covariant and contravariant components of the maxwell electro - magnetic tensor are @xmath17    there are other four non - trivial einstein equations @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 with unknown functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 to be solved @xmath22 where subscript denotes partial derivation .",
    "now we are trying to solve these equations with the assumption that @xmath10 is a function of coordinate @xmath5 only . consequently equations ( [ einst2 ] ) and ( [ einst4 ] )",
    "lead to independence of functions @xmath9 and @xmath11 on coordinate @xmath4 . therefore all unknown functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 now depend on coordinate @xmath5 only .",
    "we should solve two einstein equations @xmath18 ( [ einst1 ] ) and @xmath21 ( [ einst4 ] ) @xmath26    from ( [ einst02 ] ) we evaluate @xmath27 which is subsequently put into ( [ einst01 ] ) then we get only one equation for two unknown functions @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "@xmath30    we can choose one arbitrary function @xmath31 , let us choose it in the form @xmath32    we obtain the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are integration constants .",
    "next , the new metrics components for the solution ( [ newm ] ) can be computed @xmath36 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary function and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the metric tensor must satisfy hilbert conditions which lead to inequalities @xmath37    now we are looking at simplifying resulting metrics tensor using constants substitutions and coordinate transformations @xmath38 where striped coordinates denote the new ones .",
    "the transformation ( [ transf ] ) is formally equivalent to the choice of function @xmath31 as @xmath39 thus , from the metric tensor we have removed the arbitrary function @xmath31 which can be interpreted as an arbitrary transformation in coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting form of the metric tensor is @xmath40 where we have abandoned the strips and the hilbert conditions give @xmath41    moreover , we can look for solutions beyond hilbert conditions .",
    "they can be gained from einstein equations ( [ einst1 ] ) , ( [ einst2 ] ) , ( [ einst3 ] ) and ( [ einst4 ] ) with the assumption that @xmath10 is function only of coordinate @xmath4",
    ". then equations ( [ einst1 ] ) and ( [ einst2 ] ) lead to independence of functions @xmath9 and @xmath11 on coordinate @xmath5 . so all unknown functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 depend only on coordinate @xmath4 now .",
    "the resulting metric tensor has the form @xmath45 corresponding hilbert conditions for this solution are @xmath46 the solution ( [ solution2 ] ) can be obtained directly from the solution ( [ solution ] ) exchanging coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "let us explore some properties of the solutions ( [ solution ] ) and ( [ solution2 ] ) now .",
    "metrics ( [ solution ] ) is singular at @xmath47 .",
    "singularities at @xmath48 are only coordinate ones , there exist horizons . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath49 is a real physical singularity , and scalar invariants of the riemann tensor diverge here as shown @xmath50    the electro - magnetic potential in solution ( [ solution ] ) is @xmath51 the components of maxwell electro - magnetic tensor are @xmath52 we can write down three usual dimensional components of the maxwell tensor as @xmath53 , \\\\ \\vec{b}&=&\\left[0,0,-k\\left(\\frac{k+z}{z}\\right)^2\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this solution there exists only a magnetic field . the magnetic field @xmath54 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( where @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is also possible to evaluate geodesic trajectories of motion when testing particles are fixed in @xmath4,@xmath5 plane .",
    "the null geodesic lines are given explicitly by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an integration constant .",
    "such geodesic lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the motion of the charged test particles in the @xmath4,@xmath5 plane is given by @xmath58 the dots denote differentiation with respect to an affinne parameter .",
    "it is clear that the central singular plane acts as a source of repulsive power .",
    "let us consider a static plane - symmetric solution as appears in @xcite ( with null cosmological constant ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an arbitrary function of coordinate @xmath5 , a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath5 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants and @xmath63 is the charge per unit area .",
    "when we use the transformations @xmath64 or analogous ones @xmath65 our solution ( [ gsol1 ] ) - ( [ gsol4 ] ) turns to be identical with the mcvittie ( [ solutiong ] ) with @xmath66 .",
    "the mcvittie solution @xcite is thus generated by the killing @xmath67 vector from the seed metric ( [ sedm ] ) .",
    "let us connect both ( [ solution ] ) and ( [ solution2 ] ) solutions together through the horizons @xmath68 .",
    "we will use retarded and advanced null geodesic coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 like this @xmath71 after transformation of the metric tensor from the cartesian coordinate couple @xmath5 , @xmath4 to the null one @xmath69 , @xmath70 we get @xmath72 exponential transformation is used here ( which doubles the regions as in kruskal analytical extension of schwarzchild solution @xcite and leaves the coordinates null ) @xmath73 now again , we diagonalize the metric by using the new cartesian coordinate couple @xmath74 , @xmath75",
    "@xmath76 this leads to the metrics tensor @xmath77 where @xmath5 , which is @xmath5 in ( [ solution ] ) for @xmath78 and @xmath4 in ( [ solution2 ] ) for @xmath79 , is given implicitly by the equation @xmath80 at first sight there are no sign changes between @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the hilbert conditions are always satisfied for all values of @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting space - time contains every original region i : @xmath78 , ii : @xmath83 , and iii : @xmath84 twice as shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , in ( [ kruskal ] ) there are still singularities at @xmath85 but no more at @xmath86 .",
    "lines with constant @xmath5 form over @xmath75 , @xmath74 plane a hyperbolic paraboloid and lines with constant @xmath4 form lines @xmath87 as shown in fig .",
    "singular points @xmath88 are represented by values @xmath89 of @xmath90 , the apparent singularity @xmath86 is moved to infinity in these coordinates .",
    "null geodesic lines in @xmath91 are straight lines @xmath92 as displayed by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the transformation to the penrose conformal diagram is done by these transformations ( again leave null coordinates ) @xmath93 new null coordinates @xmath94 are limited by @xmath95 so the infinity has been conformaly moved to finite distance .",
    "now it is possible to draw the penrose diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .        here",
    "are marked geodesic future and past @xmath96 , null future and past @xmath97 and the time - like infinity @xmath98 .",
    "for the physical singularity @xmath99 is @xmath100 and both are time - like , so it is possible for an observer to avoid falling in it .",
    "we have found two electro - vacuum plane symmetric exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations using the generating conjecture and the killing vector @xmath67 of the plane symmetric vacuum seed metric .",
    "we have shown that one of them is equivalent to the mcvittie solution of a charged infinite thin plane .",
    "we also carried out analytical extension of coordinates , which can cover both found solutions with only one coordinate chart .",
