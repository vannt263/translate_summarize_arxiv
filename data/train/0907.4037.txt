    "it is often said that the mechanism underlying phase transitions is the decrease of internal energy in the ordered phase .",
    "however , it has been shown long ago that melting is dominated by the strong short ranged repulsive forces , and the related solid - fluid transitions are entropy - driven . accordingly",
    ", purely repulsive models have been often used to study the fluid equation of state towards the structural ordering transition .",
    "the most striking demonstration of these observations is given by the family of hard - core models , which have long played a central role in this field .",
    "in these models , particles interact exclusively through an extended hard core , and there is no temperature scale associated with the potential ( interaction energy is either infinite inside the exclusion region or zero outside ) .",
    "thus , temperature and energy play no role , and the dynamics is completely determined by entropy considerations . yet , these models exhibit various types of ordering transitions .",
    "they include , for example , the famous isotropic - nematic transition in a three dimensional system of thin hard rods @xcite , as well as the extensively studied hard spheres models @xcite , undergoing a first order fluid - solid transition for @xmath6 and , presumably , a second order transition from a fluid to the hexatic phase @xcite .",
    "these models are purely entropy - driven , yet they capture the essential molecular mechanism that drives freezing transitions .    a complete description of the fluid phase is provided by the mayer cluster series in terms of the activity , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the chemical potential .",
    "for purely repulsive potentials , the radius of convergence of the cluster series is known to be determined by a singularity on the negative real axis , @xmath9 , typically very close to the origin @xcite . near this point ,",
    "the singular part of the density is characterized by the critical exponent @xmath2 : @xmath10 as a result of this singularity , the radius of convergence of the mayer series includes only the extremely low density regime , and the fluid - solid transition is way beyond it .",
    "it is therefore desirable to find a way to extend the information contained in the cluster integrals series to provide information about the behavior of the system close to the ordering transition region . in particular , one is interested in the critical exponent @xmath3 characterizing the density near the physical termination point of the fluid @xmath11 : @xmath12    it has been shown that this goal may be achieved by transforming the cluster integral series into a tridiagonal symmetric matrix form @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath13 adopt a clear asymptotic form , and converge extremely fast to two different constants : @xmath14 ( off - diagonal ) and @xmath15 ( diagonal ) .",
    "this fact can then be utilized to obtain good approximants for the fluid density far outside of the convergence circle of the power series @xcite . like pad methods ,",
    "these approximants are consistent with the known elements to all available orders",
    ". however , the @xmath4 matrix scheme seems to fit much better purely repulsive systems , as it incorporates the existence of two singular points on the real axis @xcite . yet ,",
    "a major shortcoming of this approach was its failure at the critical regime .",
    "it is easy to prove ( see below ) that tridiagonal @xmath4 matrices described at the asymptote by two constant values lead to universal critical exponents @xmath16 at both singularities , which are obviously wrong .",
    "thus , the above approach fails when one is in close vicinity to the transition region .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "analysis of the r matrix as detailed above may be used to predict the critical behavior of all models with purely repulsive interactions .",
    "our results apply equally to continuum and lattice models in all dimensions . here",
    "we demonstrate applications to a number of 2d hard - core lattice gas models .    for all the models to follow , we have calculated the cluster integrals to a high order ( in order to calculate the @xmath4 matrix ) .",
    "it is natural to compare standard series analysis methods @xcite to the results to be obtained from the @xmath4-matrix .",
    "we have applied the ratio method , dlog pad and differential approximants to the models to follow . in general ,",
    "ratio analysis of the series provide a rather exact estimate of the non - physical singularity location @xmath17 and the related @xmath18 , but says nothing about the physically relevant @xmath11 and @xmath3 .",
    "dlog pad approximants again converge nicely to predict a singularity at @xmath19 but show no consistent pole anywhere on the positive real z - axis .",
    "similar results were obtained using the differential approximants .",
    "overall , these methods do better then the @xmath4 matrix for the nonphysical singularity .",
    "the reason for these failures is the existence of a branch - cut singularity located so close to the origin , which makes the physical singularity , typically much further away , undetectable by these methods .",
    "the @xmath4 matrix , which incorporates the branch - cut naturally , is more successful .",
    "even though standard series analysis methods are often superior to the @xmath4 matrix as a means to analyze the non - physical singularity , we still include in the following the @xmath4-matrix results for both singularities .",
    "the reason is that unlike standard methods , @xmath4 matrix is expected to work equally well for both termination points .",
    "the accuracy of both exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 depends roughly equally on the quality of the fitting parameters describing the asymptotic behavior of the matrix elements . thus , our @xmath4 matrix results for @xmath2 should not be taken as the yardstick for measuring @xmath4 matrix vs. dlog pad , but rather as a measure of the accuracy of the @xmath4 matrix itself , as one expects the same degree of accuracy for both exponents calculated .",
    "the hard hexagons model ( lattice gas on on a triangular lattice with nearest - neighbors exclusion ) was solved exactly by baxter @xcite .",
    "this allows us to calculate many cluster coefficients and matrix elements . the density in this model",
    "is given exactly by the relation @xcite    @xmath20    using this relation , one is able to expand the density in power series of the activity @xmath1 and extract the cluster integrals @xmath21 . employing infinite - precision integer computation we extended the 24 elements calculated in @xcite to 1100 elements , enabling the construction of the first 550 diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the r matrix @xcite . these allowed unambiguous determination of the asymptotic form of these elements .",
    "one can observe in figure  [ fig - hhl ] clear oscillations of the matrix elements .",
    "therefore application of the formula presented in @xcite , which is based on a @xmath22 correction term , was doubtful .",
    "based on the analysis above and the extended formula , one may calculate the critical exponent from fitting the matrix elements of the hard hexagons model .",
    "this results in @xmath23 where the exact result is @xmath24 .",
    "note that the early version of as presented in @xcite gives in this case @xmath25 .",
    "the result for the nonphysical critical exponent calculated based on our @xmath4 matrix analysis and is @xmath26 , which compares well to the exact universal result @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "next , we study the triangular lattice n2 model ( exclusion up to the next - nearest - neighbor ) .",
    "this model was long ago investigated , and early studies suggested that the phase transition is first order @xcite .",
    "however , later transfer matrix analysis @xcite , and recent exhaustive mc results @xcite concluded that the model undergoes a second order phase transition at @xmath27 and critical density @xmath28 , and is believed to be part of the @xmath29 potts universality class , with @xmath30 .",
    "we used the transfer matrix method to obtain an exact expansion of the partition function in powers of the activity .",
    "we have constructed transfer matrices for strips with width up to @xmath31 ( number of symmetry reduced states in the @xmath31 matrix is 730100 ) .",
    "we then constructed the exact low-@xmath1 power series expansion for the density @xmath32 , the first 17 coefficients of which are identical with their bulk values ( the cluster integrals for the models considered henceforth and the resulting @xmath4 matrices are given in tables  [ nbn ] ,  [ rmat ] ) .",
    "the difference @xmath33 should converge to @xmath34 . in the absence of oscillatory terms , the slope of this difference against @xmath5 determines the critical exponent by . as seen in figure  [ fig - trin2c ] the matrix elements are well fitted , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and extrapolation of @xmath37 alone gives @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , in this case analysis of the r matrix shows clearly that @xmath39 which means that will lead to an imaginary @xmath3 .",
    "as discussed above , in such cases the above analysis breaks down as the spectrum edge shifts from @xmath40 . indeed , for this model the critical activity as determined by mc studies , @xmath41 @xcite , deviates significantly from @xmath42 , clearly demonstrating the spectrum edge shift .",
    "having tested the limits of the method , we move on to apply it and examine models in which the critical behavior is not known . the n4 model on a square lattice ( hard - core exclusion of all neighbors up to the @xmath43 order )",
    "was first studied using transfer matrix methods @xcite . recently ,",
    "it was revisited , employing mc simulations @xcite .",
    "it is believed to undergo a second order fluid - solid transition of the ising universality class .",
    "the critical chemical potential was found to be @xmath44 with a critical density @xmath45 @xcite , where the closest packing density is @xmath46 .    here too , we used the transfer matrix method to obtain an exact expansion of the partition function and expand the density in powers of the activity .",
    "we have constructed transfer matrices for strips with width up to @xmath47 .",
    "employing translational and inversion symmetries , the number of symmetry reduced states in the @xmath47 matrix is 4137859 . using this matrix",
    ", we obtained the first 18 coefficients that are identical with the bulk values .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements take the form @xmath48 , while the off - diagonal ones exhibit no visible oscillations , and are well fitted by the cubic form @xmath49 ( see figure  [ fig - n4 ] ) .",
    "based on the fit parameters , one is able to predict the non - physical singularity location @xmath50 , which compares well with the value we obtained from direct ratio analysis of the series @xmath51 .",
    "the critical exponent at this singularity is calculated by [ expcor ] to be @xmath52 , close to the exact universal value @xmath18 .",
    "looking at the physical singularity , one observes @xmath53 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath54 , barely consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "while the accuracy in determining the critical activity is low , the critical density can be determined to much better accuracy @xmath55 , in good agreement with the mc results .",
    "it is remarkable that we are able to determine to such accuracy the critical density at the fluid - solid transition based on the low - density behavior of the fluid alone .",
    "the critical exponent may be found by to be @xmath56 .",
    "thus , based on our analysis of the cluster integrals we can quite safely exclude the possibility of the ising universality class , where @xmath57 .",
    "the latter result contradicts the numerical observations of @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical studies of this model aimed at an accurate calculation of the critical exponents are required to settle this discrepancy .      finally , we look at the n5 model on a square lattice ( hard - core exclusion of all neighbors up to the @xmath58 order ) .",
    "this model was also recently studied using mc simulations @xcite and found to undergo a weak first order transition at @xmath59 .",
    "again , we calculated 18 cluster coefficients using the transfer matrix method up to @xmath47 . in this case",
    ", one observes no oscillations , but the @xmath4 matrix elements exhibit a strong third - order correction term : @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see figure  [ fig - n5 ] ) .",
    "while the third order term is stronger than the second - order one in the regime studied , our rg analysis allows us to conclude that the @xmath62 correction does not change the critical exponents and we can use . the non - physical exponent @xmath2 calculated from the above parameters , @xmath63 is in reasonable agreement with the exact universal result @xmath64 . similar calculation for the physical singularity yields @xmath65 .",
    "the accuracy of the latter result might suffer from the lack of insufficient cluster integrals .",
    "however , one can safely say that the diagonal @xmath5 amplitude @xmath66 is small , and thus the physical exponent @xmath67 would not deviate much from @xmath2 , and should satisfy @xmath68 .",
    "the critical activity @xmath69 is estimated to be @xmath70 , but is highly sensitive to small errors in @xmath14 and @xmath15 and might be very well equal or higher than the one reported in @xcite ( @xmath71 ) . if @xmath72 then the critical point we found corresponds to the termination of the super - cooled fluid phase .",
    "this scenario is discussed in @xcite and was suggested to be related to a glass transition @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 matrix representation of the mayer cluster integrals converges very quickly to its asymptotic form .",
    "it therefore provides a powerful tool for extrapolating the low-@xmath1 expansion of the fluid equation of state to cover the full fluid regime . in this work",
    "we analyze the analytic properties of this equation of state in the vicinity of the critical points .",
    "it is shown that not only the location of the critical points , but also the critical exponents can be determined if one identifies correctly the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath4 matrix elements .",
    "a number of correction forms are analyzed , most of which are shown by rg arguments to be irrelevant for the critical behavior .",
    "thus , we provide an exact formula for the critical exponents , depending on a relatively few parameters characterizing the functional dependence of the matrix elements .",
    "application of this method to a number of lattice - gas models results in partial agreement with recent mc studies .",
    "analysis of the discrepancies through an extensive mc study is left for future work .",
    "we thank asher baram for numerous discussions and for critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "here we give an explicit recursive construction of a tridiagonal symmetric @xmath4 matrix that satisfies .",
    "first , assign @xmath73 assuming all elements @xmath74 are known for @xmath75 ( and is satisfied for @xmath76 ) , we construct @xmath77 and @xmath78 as follows :    define @xmath79 to be the @xmath80 leading submatrix of @xmath4 , i.e. , the first @xmath81 rows and first @xmath81 columns of @xmath4 . the next off - diagonal element is given by @xmath82 now define @xmath83 to be the @xmath84 leading submatrix of @xmath4 , with zero as its @xmath85 element .",
    "the next diagonal element is then given by @xmath86    it is easy to see by explicit multiplication that the submatrix up to row and column @xmath81 satisfy up to @xmath87 .",
    "further matrix elements do not affect @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , each additional cluster integral allows for one additional @xmath4 matrix elements .",
    "it should be pointed out that the above process is exponentially sensitive to errors .",
    "this means that if one is interested in matrices with @xmath90 or so , the cluster integrals used should be exact or at least known to high accuracy .",
    "in addition , the actual construction of @xmath4 matrices should generally be done using high - accuracy arithmetics to avoid build - up of round - off errors .",
    "we first show that @xmath91 ^ 2 \\simeq 4^{-n},\\quad\\quad ( n\\to\\infty).\\ ] ] taking the logarithm of the product , one obtains @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath93 irrational , the sequence @xmath94 is uniformly dense in @xmath95 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath96 the sum may be replaced by an integral @xmath97= 2n\\int\\limits_{0}^{2\\pi } \\ln[1+\\cos(x)]dx=-2n\\ln(2).\\nonumber\\ ] ] exponentiating the result , one reveals .",
    "secondly , we show that @xmath98 ^ 2 = \\frac{2}{1-\\cos(q)}.\\ ] ] it follows from the definition that @xmath99 satisfies @xmath100 ^ 2f(2q)$ ] .",
    "this recursion rule is indeed satisfied by @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "all left to be shown is that there is no other ( continuous ) solution .",
    "assume there exist two different solutions @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "their difference @xmath104 then satisfies @xmath105 ^",
    "2\\delta f(2q ) = \\delta f(2^n q)\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n[1+\\cos(2^{j-1}q)]^2\\ ] ]    let @xmath93 be irrational .",
    "@xmath106 is continuous , thus for each @xmath107 there exists @xmath108 such that @xmath109 .",
