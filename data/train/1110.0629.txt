    "recently there is an increasing interest in the randomly distributed stick ( rodlike ) particles  @xcite , due to promising developments in the area of the conducting rodlike nanoparticle networks , such as carbon nanotubes , silicon , copper , and silver nanowires , with applications in electronics  @xcite , optoelectronics  @xcite , and sensors  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "most of the work done until now in the field of percolation of random networks is done for lattice percolation  @xcite .",
    "the random stick networks are an important representative of continuum percolation  @xcite .",
    "random stick percolation and lattice percolation fall into the same universality class having the same critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "previous studies established that all systems fall on the same scaling function if dimensionality of the system , percolation rule , boundary conditions , and aspect ratio are fixed  @xcite . in applications ,",
    "aspect ratio of the rectangular system is the only variable parameter , e.g. , geometry of transistor gate channel in the carbon nanotube transistors  @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to describe in consistent way finite size scaling of average percolation density and standard deviation for the asymmetric rectangular stick systems with free boundaries . from general scaling arguments",
    "one would expect that for all finite size systems their convergence is governed by an exponent @xmath0  @xcite . for two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems",
    "@xmath1  @xcite . following initial",
    "ziff s publication  @xcite , hovi and aharony  @xcite argued that the irrelevant scaling variables in the renormalization - group treatment of percolation imply a slower leading - order convergence of percolation probability to its infinite - system value , characterized by an exponent @xmath2 , whose value was deducted from the monte carlo work of stauffer to be @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "further it was showed that for lattice percolation on the square system leading exponent of the average concentration at which percolation first occurs is @xmath2 , where @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "all the previous studies were performed for symmetric systems .",
    "we show that only in symmetric case the exponent of average density is @xmath2 . in asymmetric systems , we observe a leading @xmath0 exponent .",
    "another quantity , the percolation probability at the percolation threshold in symmetric bond percolating systems is size independent , i.e. , scale invariant  @xcite .",
    "until now , this behavior is not observed in other types of random percolating systems .",
    "we will demonstrate that asymmetric systems can exhibit scale invariant behavior .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate finite size scaling of the asymmetric rectangular stick systems with free boundaries . both from renormalization group considerations and in the simulations , we find that aspect ratio strongly influences scaling behavior of the percolation probability distribution function moments , i.e. , average density of sticks at which percolation first occurs and variance of percolation probability distribution function .",
    "a generalized scaling function is introduced , with aspect ratio dependent prefactors and constant exponents of the expansion .",
    "finally , it is shown that percolation probability of the asymmetric infinite sticks system at the critical threshold density agrees with cardy s analytic formula  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations , coupled with an efficient cluster analysis algorithm and implemented on grid platform , are used to investigate the stick percolation  @xcite .",
    "we consider two dimensional ( 2d ) systems with isotropically placed widthless sticks .",
    "the sticks of unit length are randomly positioned and oriented inside the rectangular system of width @xmath5 and height @xmath6 .",
    "two sticks lie in the same cluster if they intersect .",
    "system percolates if two opposite boundaries are connected with the same cluster .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath7 is defined as the length of the rectangular system in percolating direction divided with the length in perpendicular direction .",
    "we define the normalized system size as a square root of the rectangular area @xmath8 ( geometric average ) , which represent the length of the square system with the same area .",
    "the behavior of stick percolation is studied in terms of the number stick density @xmath9 .",
    "the percolation threshold of infinite system is defined by the critical density @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed for wide range of the aspect ratios , @xmath11 . in order to ensure the same precision for small and large systems we collected more than @xmath12 monte carlo realizations for small systems @xmath13 , down to @xmath14 for the largest system @xmath15 . using appropriate functions for fitting data and the least squares fitting methods",
    "excellent fits were obtained ( @xmath16 ) for all analyzed systems with @xmath17 .",
    "statistical errors for the calculations are estimated in conventional fashion using standard deviation  @xcite .",
    "percolation probability function @xmath18 , is the probability that the system with @xmath19 sticks , size @xmath20 and aspect ratio @xmath7 percolates .",
    "it is convenient to pass from the discrete percolation probability function @xmath18 for @xmath19 sticks to a probability function for arbitrary stick density @xmath21  @xcite @xmath22 with percolation probability distribution function defined as @xmath23 .",
    "the average stick percolation density at which , for the first time , a percolating cluster connects boundaries of the system is @xmath24 where the last equality follows from integrating by parts .",
    "another important parameter of probability distribution function , @xmath25 , is variance @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is calculated as @xmath28 equations  ( [ n_av ] ) and  ( [ n2_av ] ) allow calculations of the first two moments directly from discrete percolation probability function @xmath18 .",
    "this is computationally more efficient since it avoids calculation of function @xmath29 with high resolution .",
    "the percolation probability function is related to the universal scaling function  @xcite @xmath30 the arguments of the universal scaling function @xmath31 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the nonuniversal metric factors , @xmath38 are the irrelevant variables , and @xmath39 are the corrections to scaling exponents , ( @xmath40 . using free boundary conditions and considering two complementary systems : the sticks and empty space around the sticks , we can conclude that either the sticks percolate in one direction or the empty space percolates in the opposite direction : @xmath41 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 and evaluating the derivatives at @xmath45 , ( i.e. , at @xmath46 ) , we conclude that @xmath47 , for @xmath48 even .",
    "expanding the percolation probability function near the critical point we find that @xmath49 where the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined by @xmath52 and @xmath53 since percolation probability distribution function @xmath54 gives the probability distribution for a system of size @xmath20 and aspect ratio @xmath7 to percolate for the first time at stick density @xmath21 , we can define the moments of this distribution @xmath55 substituting eqs .",

    "@xmath59 is even and @xmath60 are odd functions .",
    "therefore , observed parity of prefactors in respect to @xmath44 should be independent of the type of the system .    from eq .",

    "the results for percolation probability @xmath29 and distribution @xmath25 function are shown in fig .",

    "one observes that the slope of percolation probability function increases with the increase of the system size .",

    "the fine behavior of percolation probability at @xmath73 will be discussed bellow . with the increasing system size",
    ", the standard deviation of probability distribution function decreases to zero . also , average stick percolation density @xmath64 , which corresponds roughly to maximum of probability distribution function @xmath25 , approaches to percolation threshold @xmath73 . for @xmath74",
    ", @xmath64 converges to @xmath73 from below with increase of the system size @xmath20 .",
    "the reason for this is that narrow finite systems will be spanned already at lower densities than @xmath73 . for @xmath75",
    ", @xmath76 converges from above , while for symmetric systems ( @xmath77 ) is roughly centered at @xmath73 , see fig  [ figure_1 ] . from fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] , one can see that average stick percolation density @xmath64 for aspect ratio higher than one is monotonically decreasing function of the system size @xmath20 .",
    "somewhat surprising , for aspect ratios lower than one , @xmath61 is not monotonic function and has local minimum , i.e. , for small systems @xmath64 is a decreasing function , which passes through @xmath73 , reaches a minimum and after that converges to @xmath73 from below . in inset of fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] , one can see that for large system sizes all the curves show power law convergence to the percolation threshold @xmath73 with exponent @xmath0 , except in the symmetric case , i.e. , @xmath77 , where exponent is @xmath78 .",
    "absolute values of the leading - order prefactors are the same for aspect ratios @xmath7 and @xmath79 .",
    "higher exponent of symmetric systems comes from the basic physics of percolation that is connectedness .",
    "we can illustrate this using a simplified image of site percolation by introducing quantity @xmath80 as probability that the sites with occupancy @xmath81 form a spanning path . the percolation probability @xmath80 and occupancy @xmath81 are equivalent to the percolation probability function @xmath29 and stick density @xmath21 , respectively . in this image , a cell coming out of the renormalization ( coarse graining ) transformation is occupied only if it contains a set of sites that span this cell .",
    "the universal scaling function in previous section reflects the fact that the probability of the spanning system at the percolation threshold @xmath82 remains unaltered under this transformation  @xcite",
    ". therefore fixed point of this system , i.e. , the critical percolation threshold , @xmath83 is satisfying relation @xmath84 .",
    "we can expand the percolation probability around the percolation threshold @xmath83 , @xmath85 .",
    "also , if we renormalize lattice by a length factor @xmath86 , close to @xmath83 , characteristic length changes as @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath88 , we can write another relation , @xmath89 from fig  [ figure_1 ] , one can see that probability density @xmath90 which is derivative of @xmath29 at @xmath73 , is always larger for symmetric systems than for asymmetric systems of the same size . therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ loglog ] ) , one expects higher absolute value of the exponent in symmetric compared to asymmetric systems .",
    "another conclusion one can draw from this analysis , is that the observed exponents are a result of the interplay of the characteristic length and the system shape .",
    "usually , such behavior is attributed to a competition between two - dimensional and three - dimensional ( or one - dimensional and two dimensional ) , e.g. , in ising model for slab geometries , cf .",
    "ref  @xcite . in this system",
    "we observe that there is sharp transition in nature of scaling when we pass from symmetric to asymmetric system , and a competition between exponents characteristic for symmetric and asymmetric systems .    from monte",

    ", one can observe that both prefactors are close to zero for @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , at this aspect ratio , we could not observe existence of the higher order terms .",
    "this means that at the percolation threshold percolation probability is the same for all the systems , independent of system size @xmath20 , having the value @xmath113 .",
    "scale invariance , i.e. , @xmath114 is already seen and intuitively understood for bond percolation in symmetric systems , where @xmath115 is independent of system size @xmath20 , cf .",
    "the reason for observed system size invariance of percolation probability at the threshold in the asymmetric stick system is existence of multiple zero of at least second order at this point in universal scaling function .",
    "regarding value of percolation probability at the percolation threshold of infinite system , we find that cardy s analytical model derived for the lattice percolation describes simulation data , cf .",
    "[ figure_5 ] .",
    "the deviation between analytical value for lattice and monte carlo value for stick percolation is less than statistical error of the simulation data , i.e. , less than @xmath116 .",
    "percolation probability for 2d sticks system therefore satisfies @xmath117 .",
    "in summary , based on the analysis of finite size scaling in continuum two - dimensional systems , the generalized scaling law is introduced for average percolation density , variance , and percolation probability at the percolation threshold .",
    "the presented methodology could be used to model accurately these properties for any percolating system .",
    "we find that the zeroth - order prefactor of average percolation density is odd function with respect to @xmath118 .",
    "this explains the faster convergence of average percolation density for symmetric systems than expected from general scaling arguments .",
    "we also observe that there is a characteristic aspect ratio for which percolation probability at the percolation threshold is system size independent .",
    "in addition , for infinite system , we find that percolation probability at the critical threshold density shows excellent agreement with the cardy s prediction for lattice percolation .",
    "the presented results confirm that continuum percolation belongs to the same universality class as lattice percolation in the sense that value of percolation probability at the threshold for infinitely large systems is the same for lattice and continuum percolation .",
    "one should note that a number of other features observed in this work should be a common characteristic within the class , e.g. , existence of the aspect ratio where the percolation probability at the threshold is scale invariant and parity of the moments of the percolation probability distribution function .",
    "this opens up the question of the particle shape influence on prefactors , weather it is possible to find systems where the observed behaviors are more pronounced , and finally the question of the general form of the prefactors for describing different systems .",
