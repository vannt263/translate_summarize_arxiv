    "soon the first econophysics conferences were organized : _ international workshop on econophysics _ ,",
    "budapest , 1997 and _ international workshop on econophysics and statistical finance _ , palermo , 1998 @xcite , and the book _ an introduction to econophysics _",
    "@xcite was published .",
    "the term `` econophysics '' was introduced by analogy with similar terms , such as astrophysics , geophysics , and biophysics , which describe applications of physics to different fields . particularly important",
    "is the parallel with biophysics , which studies living creatures , which still obey the laws of physics .",
    "it should be emphasized that econophysics does not literally apply the laws of physics , such as newton s laws or quantum mechanics , to humans , but rather uses mathematical methods developed in statistical physics to study statistical properties of complex economic systems consisting of a large number of humans .",
    "so , it may be considered as a branch of applied theory of probabilities . however , statistical physics is distinctly different from mathematical statistics in its focus , methods , and results .",
    "originating from physics as a quantitative science , econophysics emphasizes quantitative analysis of large amounts of economic and financial data , which became increasingly available with the massive introduction of computers and the internet .",
    "econophysics distances itself from the verbose , narrative , and ideological style of political economy and is closer to * econometrics * in its focus .",
    "studying mathematical models of a large number of interacting economic agents , econophysics has much common ground with the * agent - based modeling and simulation*. correspondingly , it distances itself from the representative - agent approach of traditional economics , which , by definition , ignores statistical and heterogeneous aspects of the economy .    two major directions in econophysics are applications to finance and economics . applications to finance",
    "are described in a separate article , * econophysics of financial markets * , in this encyclopedia .",
    "observational aspects are covered in the article * econophysics , observational*. the present article , * econophysics , statistical mechanics approach to * , concentrates primarily on statistical distributions of money , wealth , and income among interacting economic agents .",
    "another direction related to econophysics has been advocated by the theoretical physicist serge galam since early 1980 under the name of * sociophysics * @xcite , with the first appearance of the term in print in ref .",
    "it echoes the term `` physique sociale '' proposed in the nineteenth century by auguste comte , the founder of sociology . unlike econophysics , the term `` sociophysics '' did not catch on when first introduced , but it is coming back with the popularity of econophysics and active promotion by some physicists @xcite . while the principles of both fields have a lot in common , econophysics focuses on the narrower subject of economic behavior of humans , where more quantitative data is available , whereas sociophysics studies a broader range of social issues .",
    "the boundary between econophysics and sociophysics is not sharp , and the two fields enjoy a good rapport @xcite . a more detailed description of historical development in presented in sec .  [ sec : history ] .",
    "statistical mechanics was developed in the second half of the nineteenth century by james clerk maxwell , ludwig boltzmann , and josiah willard gibbs .",
    "these physicists believed in the existence of atoms and developed mathematical methods for describing their statistical properties , such as the probability distribution of velocities of molecules in a gas ( the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ) and the general probability distribution of states with different energies ( the boltzmann ",
    "gibbs distribution ) .",
    "there are interesting connections between the development of statistical physics and statistics of social phenomena , which were recently brought up by the science journalist philip ball @xcite .",
    "collection and study of `` social numbers '' , such as the rates of death , birth , and marriage , has been growing progressively since the seventeenth century ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  3 ) .",
    "the term `` statistics '' was introduced in the eighteenth century to denote these studies dealing with the civil `` states '' , and its practitioners were called `` statists '' .",
    "popularization of social statistics in the nineteenth century is particularly accredited to the belgian astronomer adolphe quetelet . before the 1850s , statistics was considered an empirical arm of political economy , but then it started to transform into a general method of quantitative analysis suitable for all disciplines .",
    "it stimulated physicists to develop statistical mechanics in the second half of the nineteenth century .",
    "rudolf clausius started development of the kinetic theory of gases , but it was james clerk maxwell who made a decisive step of deriving the probability distribution of velocities of molecules in a gas .",
    "historical studies show ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) that , in developing statistical mechanics , maxwell was strongly influenced and encouraged by the widespread popularity of social statistics at the time .",
    "this approach was further developed by ludwig boltzmann , who was very explicit about its origins @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` the molecules are like individuals ,   and the properties of gases only remain unaltered , because the number of these molecules , which on the average have a given state , is constant .

    "it is worth noting that many now - famous economists were originally educated in physics and engineering .",

    "working as a civil engineer , he collected statistics demonstrating that distributions of income and wealth in a society follow a power law @xcite .",
    "he later became a professor of economics at lausanne , where he replaced lon walras , also an engineer by education .",
    "the influential american economist irving fisher was a student of gibbs .",
    "however , most of the mathematical apparatus transferred to economics from physics was that of newtonian mechanics and classical thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "it culminated in the neoclassical concept of mechanistic equilibrium where the `` forces '' of supply and demand balance each other .",
    "the more general concept of statistical equilibrium largely eluded mainstream economics .    with time , both physics and economics became more formal and rigid in their specializations , and the social origin of statistical physics was forgotten .",
    "the situation is well summarized by philip ball @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` today physicists regard the application of statistical mechanics to social phenomena as a new and risky venture .",

    "several economists applied statistical physics to economic problems @xcite . an early attempt to bring together the leading theoretical physicists and economists at the santa fe institute was not entirely successful @xcite",
    "however , by the late 1990s , the attempts to apply statistical physics to social phenomena finally coalesced into the robust movements of econophysics and sociophysics , as described in sec .",

    "the overlap with economists is the strongest in the field of agent - based simulation .",
    "not surprisingly , the conference series wehia / eshia , which deals with heterogeneous interacting agents , regularly includes sessions on econophysics .",
    "when modern econophysics started in the middle of 1990s , its attention was primarily focused on analysis of financial markets .",
    "however , three influential papers @xcite , dealing with the subject of money and wealth distributions , were published in year 2000 .",
    "they started a new direction that is closer to economics than finance and created an expanding wave of follow - up publications .",
    "we start reviewing this subject with ref .",
    "@xcite , whose results are the most closely related to the traditional statistical mechanics in physics .",
    "the fundamental law of equilibrium statistical mechanics is the boltzmann - gibbs distribution .",
    "it states that the probability @xmath23 of finding a physical system or sub - system in a state with the energy @xmath6 is given by the exponential function @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the temperature , and @xmath26 is a normalizing constant @xcite . here",
    "we set the boltzmann constant @xmath27 to unity by choosing the energy units for measuring the physical temperature @xmath25 .",
    "then , the expectation value of any physical variable @xmath1 can be obtained as @xmath28 where the sum is taken over all states of the system .",
    "temperature is equal to the average energy per particle : @xmath29 , up to a numerical coefficient of the order of 1 .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) can be derived in different ways @xcite .",
    "all derivations involve the two main ingredients : statistical character of the system and conservation of energy @xmath6 .",
    "one of the shortest derivations can be summarized as follows .",
    "let us divide the system into two ( generally unequal ) parts .",
    "then , the total energy is the sum of the parts : @xmath30 , whereas the probability is the product of probabilities : @xmath31 .",
    "the only solution of these two equations is the exponential function ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "a more sophisticated derivation , proposed by boltzmann himself , uses the concept of entropy .",
    "let us consider @xmath32 particles with the total energy @xmath33 .",
    "let us divide the energy axis into small intervals ( bins ) of width @xmath34 and count the number of particles @xmath35 having the energies from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio @xmath38 gives the probability for a particle to have the energy @xmath36 .",
    "let us now calculate the multiplicity @xmath39 , which is the number of permutations of the particles between different energy bins such that the occupation numbers of the bins do not change .",
    "this quantity is given by the combinatorial formula in terms of the factorials @xmath40 the logarithm of multiplicity is called the entropy @xmath41 . in the limit of large numbers , the entropy per particle can be written in the following form using the stirling approximation for the factorials @xmath42 now we would like to find what distribution of particles between different energy states has the highest entropy , i.e. ,  the highest multiplicity , provided that the total energy of the system , @xmath43 , has a fixed value .",
    "solution of this problem can be easily obtained using the method of lagrange multipliers @xcite , and the answer gives the exponential distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "the same result can be derived from the * ergodic theory * , which says that the many - body system occupies all possible states of a given total energy with equal probabilities .",
    "then it is straightforward to show @xcite that the probability distribution of the energy of an individual particle is given by eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "the derivations outlined in sec .  [ sec : bgphysics ] are very general and use only the statistical character of the system and the conservation of energy .",
    "so , one may expect that the exponential boltzmann - gibbs distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) may apply to other statistical systems with a conserved quantity .",
    "the economy is a big statistical system with millions of participating agents , so it is a promising target for applications of statistical mechanics .",
    "is there a conserved quantity in the economy ?",
    "the paper @xcite argued that such a conserved quantity is money @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , the ordinary economic agents can only receive money from and give money to other agents .",
    "they are not permitted to `` manufacture '' money , e.g. ,  to print dollar bills .",
    "when one agent @xmath45 pays money @xmath46 to another agent @xmath47 for some goods or services , the money balances of the agents change as follows @xmath48 the total amount of money of the two agents before and after transaction remains the same @xmath49 i.e. ,  there is a local conservation law for money .",
    "the rule ( [ transfer ] ) for the transfer of money is analogous to the transfer of energy from one molecule to another in molecular collisions in a gas , and eq .",
    "( [ conservation ] ) is analogous to conservation of energy in such collisions .",
    "addressing some misunderstandings developed in economic literature @xcite , we should emphasize that , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the transfer of money from one agent to another happens voluntarily , as a payment for goods and services in a market economy .",
    "however , the model only keeps track of money flow , but does not keep track of what kind of goods and service are delivered .",
    "one reason for this is that many goods , e.g.,food and other supplies , and most services , e.g. ,  getting a haircut or going to a movie , are not tangible and disappear after consumption . because they are not conserved , and also because they are measured in different physical units , it is not very practical to keep track of them .",
    "in contrast , money is measured in the same unit ( within a given country with a single currency ) and is conserved in transactions , so it is straightforward to keep track of money flow .    unlike , ordinary economic agents , a central bank or a central government can inject money into the economy .",
    "this process is analogous to an influx of energy into a system from external sources , e.g. ,  the earth receives energy from the sun .",
    "dealing with these situations , physicists start with an idealization of a closed system in thermal equilibrium and then generalize to an open system subject to an energy flux .",
    "as long as the rate of money influx from central sources is slow compared with relaxation processes in the economy and does not cause hyperinflation , the system is in quasi - stationary statistical equilibrium with slowly changing parameters .",
    "this situation is analogous to heating a kettle on a gas stove slowly , where the kettle has a well - defined , but slowly increasing temperature at any moment of time .",
    "another potential problem with conservation of money is debt .",
    "this issue is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : debt ] . as a starting point , ref .",
    "@xcite first considered simple models , where debt is not permitted .",
    "this means that money balances of agents can not go below zero : @xmath50 for all @xmath45 .",
    "transaction ( [ transfer ] ) takes place only when an agent has enough money to pay the price : @xmath51 , otherwise the transaction does not take place .",
    "if an agent spends all money , the balance drops to zero @xmath52 , so the agent can not buy any goods from other agents . however , this agent can still produce goods or services , sell them to other agents , and receive money for that . in real life ,",
    "cash balance dropping to zero is not at all unusual for people who live from paycheck to paycheck .",
    "the conservation law is the key feature for the successful functioning of money .",
    "if the agents were permitted to `` manufacture '' money , they would be printing money and buying all goods for nothing , which would be a disaster .",
    "the physical medium of money is not essential , as long as the conservation law is enforced .",
    "money may be in the form of paper cash , but today it is more often represented by digits in computerized bank accounts .",
    "the conservation law is the fundamental principle of accounting , whether in the single - entry or the double - entry form .",
    "more discussion of banks and debt is given in sec .",

    "the random distribution of @xmath46 is supposed to represent the wide variety of prices for different products in the real economy .",
