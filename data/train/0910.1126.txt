    "the large hadron collider will collide proton bunches every 25 nanoseconds with a center - of - mass energy of 14 tev . at the design luminosity",
    ", each collision on average produces 23 minimum - bias interactions that result in high detector occupancy and create a challenging environment for event readout and reconstruction . on one hand , limited data store bandwidth demands a significant online rate reduction of 5 - 6 orders of magnitude . on the other hand , events with interesting physics signatures",
    "must be selected very efficiently from the vast lhc background .",
    "the atlas experiment employs a sophisticated three - level trigger system to achieve these goals  @xcite .",
    "level-1 selection is performed in dedicated hardware that uses coarse - granularity information from calorimeters and muon spectrometers to apply cuts to a variety of objects , such as jets , muons , electromagnetic clusters , and missing energy .",
    "although adding tracking information at this stage would be extremely beneficial to discern certain physics objects , the small timing window available to level-1 ( 2.5 @xmath2 ) makes this currently impossible .",
    "moreover , even projected cpu farms that constitute the level-2 trigger can not perform global track reconstruction within their time budget of about 10 ms .",
    "instead , level-2 does limited tracking inside regions of interest ( roi ) identified by the level-1 trigger .",
    "fasttracker ( ftk )  @xcite is a proposed dedicated hardware track processor inspired by the silicon vertex trigger ( svt )  @xcite from the cdf detector .",
    "ftk operates in parallel with the normal silicon detector readout following each level-1 trigger and reconstructs tracks over the entire detector volume ( up to @xmath3 of 2.5 ) in under a millisecond .",
    "having tracks available by the beginning of level-2 processing allows reduced level-1 @xmath4 thresholds since the level-2 trigger is able to reject non - interesting events more quickly .",
    "furthermore , since level-2 is freed up from tracking , the extra processing time becomes available for more advanced online algorithms .",
    "in order to perform tracking with good efficiency and resolution , ftk uses data from the two inner - most subsystems of the atlas inner detector  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ inner_detector ] ) .",
    "pixel sensors provide a two - dimensional measurement of hit position and include over 80 million readout channels .",
    "sct layers are arranged in pairs of axial and narrow - angle stereo strips and consist of 6 million channels . a typical track passes through 11 detector layers and",
    "can be reconstructed from the 14 coordinate measurements ( @xmath5 from two - dimensional pixels and @xmath6 from sct ) .",
    "custom - designed optical splitters duplicate pixel and sct readout data and send it to ftk - at full level-1 rate . since ftk non - invasively eavesdrops on the inner detector data , it easily integrates with the current atlas trigger system ( fig .  [ trigger_system ] ) .        in order to increase the overall throughput of the system , ftk splits incoming data into 8 or more _ regions _ in @xmath7 with sufficient overlap to account for inefficiencies at the edges .",
    "each region is served by a separate crate that consists of the subsystems shown in fig .",
    "[ data_flow ] .",
    "raw pixel and sct data are first received by the data formatter that uses fast fpga s to perform clustering  @xcite . clustered hits proceed into the data organizer , where they are buffered and merged into coarse superstrips used in pattern recognition .",
    "the superstrips are then sent into a pipelined array of associative memory boards that perform fast pattern finding using a pre - calculated table of particle trajectories .",
    "matched patterns are reconnected with their corresponding full - resolution hits in the data organizer and sent to the track fitters . after removal of duplicate tracks , the resulting set of ftk tracks is saved in the track data read - out buffer ( rob ) and made available to level-2 processors .",
    "luminosities above @xmath8 combined with 86 million readout channels create a unique combinatorial challenge for tracking .",
    "ftk overcomes this with the help of specialized hardware called associative memory ( am ) - a massive , ultra - fast lookup table that enumerates all realistic particle trajectories ( patterns ) through the 11 detector layers  @xcite . in order to keep the size of the trajectory lookup under control ,",
    "detector hits are merged into coarse - resolution _ superstrips _ having a width of a few millimeters .",
    "the pattern bank is precalculated either from single track monte - carlo or from real data events ( fig .",
    "[ am_bank](a ) ) and stored in the am boards .",
    "each pattern in the am includes its own comparison logic .",
    "when hits from a given event enter am boards , they are simultaneously compared with millions of pre - stored patterns . in order to account for inefficiencies in individual detector layers , ftk also matches patterns with one missing layer ( fig .",
    "[ am_bank](b ) ) .",
    "[ pattern_efficiency ] shows the efficiency for muon track reconstruction as a function of pattern bank size for the pixel superstrip size of 3 mm and sct superstrip size of 5 mm . with missing - layer pattern matching ,",
    "efficiency quickly rises to the @xmath9 level .",
    "[ am_chip ] shows the current am chip used in the cdf detector at fermilab .",
    "it uses 0.18 @xmath10 custom cells and contains up to 2,500 patterns in the 12-layer configuration . using standard cells with 90 nm technology , the capacity",
    "can be increased to 10,000 patterns per chip , with another factor of two gain possible with a custom cell design .",
    "ftk computes five track helix parameters ( curvature , @xmath11 etc ) and a @xmath12 quality of fit from the _ full resolution _ hits within each matched pattern . since patterns are constructed from reduced - granularity superstrips , multiple full - resolution hits can belong to a given superstrip .",
    "this results in some ambiguity , which is resolved by fitting all combinations within the superstrips .",
    "performing full @xmath12 minimization with respect to five parameters is an extremely slow procedure .",
    "instead , ftk reduces the track fitting problem to a set of scalar products , which can be computed efficiently using dsp units in modern commercial fpga s .",
    "this is done by arranging geometrically similar patterns into a number of groups ( called _ sectors _ ) , so that within each sector the relationship between hit positions ( @xmath13 ) and track parameters ( @xmath14 ) is approximately linear : @xmath15 the fitting coefficients for each sector are precomputed from the same training data that was used in pattern generation .",
    "an added advantage of this approach is that when real detector hits are used in training , misalignments and other detector effects are automatically taken into account .",
    "overall , the linearized approach allows ftk to achieve near - offline resolution with a fitting rate of about 1 fit per nanosecond .",
    ".- ftk and offline resolutions for tracks with @xmath16 and @xmath17 [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ resolution_table ]    table  [ resolution_table ] compares ftk track parameter resolutions for muons with an offline algorithm .",
    "overall performances are comparable ; in particular , the ftk impact parameter resolution is equal to that of offline with an additional 30 microns added in quadrature ( fig .",
    "[ resolution_muons ] ) .",
    "ftk reconstruction remains robust in higher pileup environments ( fig .",
    "[ resolution_wh ] ) .",
    "preliminary timing estimates obtained from @xmath0 @xmath1 simulation show that ftk is able to reconstruct complex events in about 1 ms . at higher luminosities , the number of fits performed in track fitters can become excessively large .",
    "this can be dramatically reduced by narrowing the superstrip width or modifying the pattern recognition and fit strategy .",
    "several potential approaches have been identified and simulated , promising to reduce ftk processing time by more than an order of magnitude .",
