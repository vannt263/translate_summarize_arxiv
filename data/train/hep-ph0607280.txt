    "in a non - abelian gauge theory , the gauge interaction of a fermion is fixed by its representation under the gauge group , up to an overall gauge coupling . the charged current interaction in the standard model ( sm )",
    "is described by an su(2 ) group , under which the three flavors of left - handed leptons transform as doublets .",
    "an obvious consequence is the lepton universality in the @xmath0 boson interactions .",
    "this has been tested in muon decay , leptonic and semi - leptonic tau decays , and leptonic meson decays ( for a review , see  @xcite ; updated results can be found in  @xcite ) , showing no evidence of deviation from it .",
    "in contrast , recent lep data on leptonic branching fractions of the @xmath0 boson appears to bear a small but intriguing discrepancy from lepton universality @xcite .",
    "an excess of 2.8 standard deviations is found in the branching ratio of the tau mode with respect to the other two leptonic modes .",
    "if one takes this number seriously and attempts to give an account of it with modification to the sm , a possibility may be to alter the model in such a way that an ( effective ) @xmath0-lepton - neutrino vertex becomes flavor - dependent .",
    "indeed , there has been a class of models taking this approach @xcite , the last of which was devised to explain the above discrepancy .",
    "this model has two su(2 ) gauge groups .",
    "the first and the second family fermions are charged under one group , and the third the other .",
    "mixing of the gauge bosons of different groups can lead to flavor - dependent lightest @xmath0 boson couplings to leptons .",
    "tuning the model parameters , one can accommodate the measured leptonic branching ratios .",
    "one immediate problem of this idea , however , is that it is likely to affect the aforementioned muon and tau decay rates mediated by @xmath0 exchange , thereby spoiling their agreement with lepton universality .",
    "another class of models that can give rise to non - universal charged current interaction are those involving a low scale seesaw mechanism @xcite , although they were not conceived for reconciling the leptonic @xmath0 branching ratios .",
    "as the difficulty with non - universal charged current interaction is rather evident , this work takes a different approach .",
    "it is speculated that the apparent excess of tau mode decay rate is in fact due to pair production of charged higgs bosons , which dominantly decay to @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the lep measurements of the @xmath0 boson decay rates are performed by counting the final state fermions .",
    "thus , if a charged higgs boson decays , its decay products may well appear to be coming from a @xmath0 decay .    to mimic a @xmath0 boson",
    ", a charged higgs boson should be light enough to be produced at lep .",
    "furthermore , its mass should be around @xmath5 to give a meaningful alteration in the number of tau mode events , since the charged higgs pair production rate rapidly decreases as @xmath6 increases .",
    "the following section will elaborate on this . throughout this paper ,",
    "the charged higgs mass is assumed to be slightly above the @xmath0 mass .",
    "this helps to avoid disturbing the @xmath0 mass measurements at the pair threshold as well .",
    "instantly , this somewhat low @xmath6 raises doubts about its compatibility with the available search results .",
    "particle search is a model - dependent task , and one should first specify in which context the charged higgs is introduced .",
    "note that this low @xmath6 is hard to be achieved in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) due to the tree - level relation , @xmath7 , in conjunction with the @xmath8-odd higgs mass lower bound , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus a remaining natural choice is a general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) which allows for @xmath10 . for this @xmath6 ,",
    "the pair production cross section of charged higgs turns out to be below 1% of that of @xmath0 , at lep energies .",
    "this kind of small peak hiding behind a much larger background resonance is extremely difficult to discriminate @xcite .",
    "in fact , branching ratio independent charged higgs mass limit from lep , is lower than @xmath5 .",
    "boson . ]    the two higgs doublets @xmath11 and @xmath12 in 2hdm  have eight real degrees of freedom .",
    "three of them are eaten by the @xmath0 and @xmath13 bosons to be their longitudinal components .",
    "the remaining five form the lighter @xmath8-even neutral higgs @xmath14 , the heavier @xmath8-even neutral higgs @xmath15 , the @xmath8-odd neutral higgs @xmath16 , and the charged higgs @xmath17 , in the case of @xmath8-conserving higgs sector . henceforth , @xmath8-invariance in the higgs sector will be assumed .",
    "the five higgs boson masses in 2hdm  can be changed independently of one another except that they are subject to the condition , @xmath18 , following from their definitions .",
    "the higgs potential has a large enough number of free parameters for this , unlike the higgs sector of mssm where many of the parameters are constrained by supersymmetry .    in the presence of more than one higgs doublets , flavor changing neural current ( fcnc ) interactions",
    "are in general mediated by higgs bosons at tree level . in order to avoid this danger",
    ", one typically makes assumptions on the way how higgs doublets couple to fermions .",
    "this work follows  @xcite in classifying models with different assumptions . in model",
    "i , only one higgs doublet , say @xmath12 , couples to quarks and charged leptons . models  iii , iv , and ii are obtained from model  i by coupling @xmath11 , instead of @xmath12 , to the down - type quarks , the charged leptons , and both , respectively .",
    "these models can be implemented by adopting a discrete symmetry for example @xcite .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    ".for each model , the higgs doublet that couples to each type of fermion is shown , and the coefficients @xmath19 in the charged higgs yukawa interaction terms written in  ( [ eq : int ] ) are given .",
    "this table is an excerpt from  @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     they are tree - level values at @xmath20 for right - handed polarized electron and left - handed polarized positron beams . the charged higgs mass is assumed to be 81  gev .",
    "one can notice that the beam polarizations can improve the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "an indirect test is to measure the decays of pair - produced @xmath0 bosons into different quark flavors .",
    "this may be considered as a background suppression method in charged higgs search .",
    "if the charged higgs is the reason for the apparent excess in @xmath21 , it should also cause the same kind of excess in @xmath22 .",
    "rejection of the @xmath0 boson background in an hadronic environment such as lhc should not be as easy as at ilc .",
    "a resolution is proposed of the possible lepton non - universality observed at the @xmath0-pair production experiments at lep .",
    "introduction of a charged higgs boson with @xmath23 , within the framework of 2hdm , could reduce the 2.8  @xmath1 of deviation down to 1.4  @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", the excessive tau mode decay rate is attributed to the pair production of charged higgses , which decay preferentially to @xmath3 among the three lepton flavors .",
    "this can be achieved without conflict with the existing direct or indirect constraints . in particular ,",
    "charged higgs direct search at lep in combination with @xmath24 singles out one viable type of 2hdmout of the four that are free of tree - level fcnc interactions .",
    "this , in turn , determines what fraction of the tau production can be ascribed to charged higgs , without @xmath2 dependence .",
    "another point to note is that this approach does not spoil other lepton universality tests from muon , tau , and meson decays .",
    "the author thanks andrew g.  akeroyd , p.  ko , yukinari sumino , reisaburo tanaka , and masahiro yamaguchi for helpful discussions .",
