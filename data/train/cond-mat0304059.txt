    "this paper is devoted to the construction of a cluster expansion adapted to the study of partially ionized gases . in the so - called physical picture of such gases",
    ", one considers an assembly of non relativistic point nuclei and electrons in thermal equilibrium with appropriate statistics and interacting with the coulomb potential .",
    "that fundamental approach is to be contrasted with the chemical picture which introduces preformed chemical species as elementary constituents . at this basic level of description",
    "all characteristic phenomena of charged systems such as atomic or molecular recombination , ionization , ionic and dielectric screening originate from the sole coulomb interaction between charges .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to treat all of them from first principles in a fully coherent way . in particular",
    "one has to deal simultaneously and without intermediate modelization with the short distance part of coulomb potential which gives rise to chemical binding ( at the scale of bohr radius ) , and with its long range part responsible for collective screening effects ( at the scale of the classical debye length ) .",
    "an important point should be stressed straight away .",
    "the very concept of atom and molecule can only make sense in a low density or moderately dense medium and at temperatures sufficiently low to be away from full ionization .",
    "this situation is captured in a scaling limit called the atomic ( or molecular ) limit , which is more precisely described in section 5 in the case of the hydrogen plasma . in that limit ,",
    "one lets temperature and density tend to zero in a coupled way .",
    "low temperature favors binding over ionization , whereas low density , by increasing the available phase space , favors dissociation .",
    "the rate at which density is reduced as the temperature tends to zero determines an energy entropy balance that selects the formation of some chemical species . in the strict limit one",
    "recovers the thermodynamical laws of mixtures of ideal substances .",
    "thus the proper physics of partially ionized gases lies in the vicinity of the atomic limit : this defines the saha regime for which it is of interest to provide a suitable expansion .    in the literature ,",
    "there exists various attempts , within the physical picture , to derive suitable expansions at low temperature and low density .",
    "first , the effective - potential method @xcite has been applied to quantum plasmas by ebeling @xcite . that first - principles approach amounts to introduce an equivalent classical system of point particles with many - body potentials which incorporate all quantum effects .",
    "low density expansions at fixed non - zero temperature have been successfully computed @xcite , while plausible expressions for basic ingredients of the chemical picture ( like effective fugacities of recombined entities ) have also been proposed within that framework @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , an explicit control of the contribution arising from any @xmath0-body potential ( @xmath1 ) can not be achieved by using simple diagrammatical techniques ( in most previous works , only two - body potentials are retained ) .",
    "therefore , all effects related to recombination into complex entities of more than two particles , can not be properly taken into account .",
    "another approach @xcite relies on a heuristic introduction of quantum and screening effects in classical versions of usual fugacities expansions . roughly speaking ,",
    "boltzmann factors at short distances are replaced by their quantum counterparts , while coulomb interactions at large distances are exponentially screened over classical debye screening length .",
    "if that method may provide rather good quantitative results at moderate temperatures and densities @xcite , explicit expressions for contributions related to any phenomenon are not available .",
    "eventually , we emphasize that many - body perturbation theory @xcite is not suited to the description of low temperature and low density regimes . indeed",
    ", perturbative expansions with respect to the coupling constant ( the electric charge ) can not account for recombination where interactions play a crucial non - perturbative role .",
    "consequently , that formalism is more appropriate for dealing with fully ionized regimes , either at low temperature and high density @xcite , or at high temperature and low density @xcite .    in order to circumvent the drawbacks of previous methods",
    ", we introduce the path integral representation of quantum coulomb gases .",
    "as shown in this paper , that formalism allows us to build an expansion which fulfills all requirements for a proper description of saha regime . in particular ,",
    "collective screening effects , as well as quantum mechanics of arbitrary particle clusters , are simultaneously dealt with . for the sake of presentation simplicity ,",
    "derivations are carried out for the hydrogen plasma made with protons and electrons ( see section 2 ) .",
    "extensions to other quantum gases are briefly mentionned in section 5 .",
    "the functional integral representation of quantum coulomb gas by means of feynman - kac formula @xcite is displayed in section 3.1 .",
    "charges of the same kind and same statistics are collected according to the cycle decomposition of the permutation group into closed brownian paths called charged loops @xcite . in terms of those loops ,",
    "statistical averages are performed according to the same rules as in classical statistical mechanics . as a consequence ,",
    "the powerful methods of mayer graphs are available in the space of loops @xcite : activities including the self - energy of a loop are associated to vertices , and bonds are usual mayer factors of interaction between different loops . because of the long range of the coulomb potential , those bonds are not integrable , and one has first to resum classes of diverging graphs in order to obtain an effective potential with shorter range . since details have already been worked out in previous works  @xcite we merely summarize the procedure in section 3.2 for the sake of completeness .",
    "the procedure follows the familiar chain graph summation as in the classical case @xcite .",
    "the subsequent effective potential is the quantum analogue of the debye potential .",
    "it incorporates specific features of quantum mechanics , namely quantum statistics , short distance gibbs weight leading to binding , as well as algebraically decaying tails due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "that effective potential is extensively studied in  @xcite : with its help one can define a resummed diagrammatics of prototype graphs that are free from coulomb divergencies .",
    "the rules are the same as those of standard abe - meeron diagrammatics .",
    "this fugacity expansion in terms of loop prototype graphs is suited to derive , at fixed non - zero temperature , low density virial equation of state in the ionized phase  @xcite .",
    "the small parameter is the density @xmath2 of unbound electrons so that contributions of bound states ( e.g. hydrogen atoms ) only occur as small corrections at order @xmath3 .",
    "the expansion ( [ quatrequinze ] ) in terms of loop prototype graphs is not well adapted to a direct analysis of saha regime , where recombined atoms or molecules appear with comparable densities at low temperature .",
    "the reason for this inadequacy is that gibbs factors arising in a given prototype graph do not provide the complete set of pair interactions that would correspond to an atomic or molecular hamiltonian .",
    "hence each prototype graph is not in direct relation with the quantities that are naturally involved in the definitions of energies and densities of recombined entities .",
    "then , the aim is to systematically reorganize the previous loop expansion into an expansion where clusters of charges are fully interacting and are in one to one correspondance with the possible chemical binding processes .",
    "this is the content of section 4 , where we derive the main result of the paper , namely new form ( [ cinqvingt ] ) of the fugacity expansion that we call the screened cluster expansion .",
    "the derivation is accomplished in three steps .",
    "the first one ( section 4.1 ) consists in collecting prototype graphs into classes such that the sum of graphs in a class builds weights of fully interacting clusters of loops .",
    "this provides gibbs factors where all pairwise interactions between loops are present .",
    "the building rules of those coefficients are the same as those of usual mayer cofficients in standard fugacity expansions .",
    "in fact , had one to deal with a gas of particles interacting by means of short range forces , those coefficients would simply be identical to standard mayer coefficients written within feynman - kac functional integral formalism .",
    "the difference here is that loops interact with the effective potential requested by the long range of coulomb interaction . as that effective potential itself results from chain summations , one must be careful to avoid double counting of graphs .",
    "it turns out that avoiding double counting induces residual interactions between clusters through the effective potential .",
    "if now mayer coefficients of fully interacting clusters are interpreted as dressed activities associated with vertices and residual interactions are associated with bonds , it is nice that the resulting diagrammatics is still of mayer type in terms of those weights and bonds : this leads to formally exact representation of the loop density . at any non - zero temperature ,",
    "each graph of ( [ cinqquatre ] ) is finite since bonds and vertices are entirely constructed with the help of the effective potential .",
    "the necessity of the second step performed in section 4.2 is the following .",
    "as explained before , the physical range of thermodynamical parameters relevant for the description of partially ionized gases lies in the neighborhood of the atomic limit , namely for vanishing densities and temperatures .",
    "if one lets the density tend to zero in weights of ( [ cinqquatre ] ) , the effective potential reduces to the bare coulomb potential so that one faces again diverging spatial integrals .",
    "hence one needs to introduce a further step if one wants cluster integrals to have a well defined atomic limit . in rough terms , it consists simply in a regularization procedure of divergent integrals by substraction of non - integrable part of their integrands .",
    "this leads to the introduction of truncated weights in such a way that new weights remain integrable when screening is removed .",
    "the definition of truncated cluster weights adopted here has a remarkable property : it preserves the topological rules of mayer diagrammatics .",
    "this leads to expansion ( [ cinqseize ] ) for the loop density .",
    "the vertices are truncated mayer coefficients , and a bond between two clusters links every loop in one cluster to every loop in the other cluster _ via _ the effective potential ( or its second and third power ) .    in a third step ( section 4.3 )",
    ", we introduce particle clusters .",
    "if in each graph of ( [ cinqseize ] ) , we detail phase - space integrations over loop internal degrees of freedom , loop clusters give rise to particle clusters . the final step amounts to collect all contributions with the same topological structure in terms of particle clusters .",
    "then , we obtain the so - called screened cluster expansion ( [ cinqvingt ] ) for the particle density . in that diagrammatic",
    "series , the graphs @xmath4 ( see fig.12 ) are identical to familiar mayer graphs with particle clusters in place of one - particle points .",
    "the internal state of a cluster is determined by a distribution of its particles into a given set of loops .",
    "its statistical weight reduces to the truncated mayer coefficient for that loop configuration .",
    "two clusters are connected by at most one bond , which can be either the total screened interaction between the respective two sets of particles , or the square or the cube of that potential .",
    "the topological rules are usual mayer rules , except for some specific rules that avoid double counting ( see section 4.4 ) . screened cluster expansions for other equilibrium quantities",
    "are discussed in section 4.5 . in particular , formula ( [ cinqvingthuit ] )",
    "allows one to study particle correlations .",
    "as detailed in section 5 , screened cluster expansions do incorporate physics required for treating saha regime .",
    "all coulomb divergencies are removed _ via _ the introduction of screened interactions with proper quantum fluctuations .",
    "recombination into complex entities is accounted for by particle clusters , because truncated mayer coefficients do preserve the non - perturbative structure of genuine gibbs operators with respect to interactions on one hand , while summation over all associated loop configurations restore correct fermi symmetrization on another hand .",
    "moreover , since the screened interaction is close to the bare coulomb potential at short distances , familiar chemical species defined in the vacuum do emerge , for instance atoms @xmath5 , molecules @xmath6 , ions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , etc ... statistical weights of particle clusters are in correspondance with the densities of the associated chemical species formed by recombination of @xmath9 protons and @xmath10 electrons .",
    "such weights incorporate thermal excitations , thermal and pressure dissociation , as well as spectral broadening of energy levels by collective effects .",
    "bonds between clusters describe all possible interactions between substances present in the gas .",
    "the present paper is merely devoted to the presentation of the general formalism . in section 5",
    ", we also discuss a few possible applications . in forthcoming papers",
    ", we shall treat quantitatively several physical situations of interest , in particular non ideal contributions to saha equation of state @xcite , the dielectric response of an atomic hydrogen gas @xcite and van der waals forces in a partially recombined plasma @xcite .",
    "we consider the two - component system ( in three dimensions ) made of protons and electrons . in the present non - relativistic limit",
    ", the proton and the electron are viewed as quantum point particles with respective masses , charges and spins , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the kinetic energy operator for each particle of species @xmath17 with position @xmath18 takes the schrodinger form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the laplacian with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "two particles separated by a distance @xmath21 interact via the instantaneous coulomb potential @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding coulomb hamiltonian @xmath23 for @xmath24 protons and @xmath25 electrons reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number of particles . in ( [ deuxun ] )",
    ", the subscript @xmath28 is attached to protons for @xmath29 and to electrons for @xmath30 , so the species index @xmath31 reduces either to @xmath32 or @xmath33 while @xmath34 denotes either the position @xmath35 of the @xmath28-th proton or the position @xmath36 of the @xmath37-th electron ( @xmath38 ) .    the system is enclosed in a box with volume @xmath39 , in contact with a thermostat at temperature @xmath40 and a reservoir of particles that fixes the chemical potentials equal to @xmath41 and @xmath42 for protons and electrons respectively .",

    "lieb and lebowitz @xcite have proved that the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath46 at fixed @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) exists , thanks to fermi statistics and screening .",
    "indeed , the fermionic statistics of at least one species implies the @xmath5-stability @xcite @xmath49 that prevents the collapse of the system . on the other hand",
    ", screening ensures that it does not explode . in a fluid phase ,",
    "the infinite system maintains local neutrality , i.e. the homogeneous local particle densities @xmath50 and @xmath51 for protons and electrons remain equal for any choice of the chemical potentials @xmath48 . in other words ,",
    "the common particle density @xmath52 , as well as all other bulk equilibrium quantities , depend on the sole combination @xmath53 and not on the difference @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , in terms of the fugacities @xmath55 , this means that both the density @xmath56 and the pressure @xmath57 are functions of @xmath47 and @xmath58 only . in the following ,",
    "we set @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the thermal de broglie wavelength of species @xmath61 .",
    "this choice guarantees that the maxwell - boltzmann densities @xmath62 and @xmath63 of free ( no interactions ) proton and electron gases respectively , are identical , i.e. @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the enforced neutrality @xmath66 of the ideal mixture simplifies the analysis of the screened cluster expansions for the interacting system derived in section 4 .      for describing dilute regimes at low fugacities ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "mayer fugacity expansions are _ a priori _ well appropriate .",

    "mayer series for particle densities @xmath81 , are easily obtained by inserting ( [ troisdeux ] ) into the identities @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "these series read @xmath84 and @xmath85 similar mayer series can be derived for any equilibrium quantity .",
    "contrary to the case of systems with short range forces , all these series must be understood in a formal sense : mayer coefficients @xmath70 diverge because the coulomb potential is not integrable at large distances .",
    "the first step of our method consists in removing all coulomb divergencies _ via _ systematic resummations of chain interactions in quantum mayer graphs defined for an equivalent gas of classical loops ( see section 3 ) .",
    "then , a suitable reorganization of the resulting resummed graphs provides the required screened cluster expansion which is well suited for describing both low temperature and low fugacity regimes ( see section 4 ) .",
    "in particular , mayer series ( [ troiscinq ] ) are rewritten in terms of well - behaved resummed coefficients @xmath86 , that do account for recombination into complex entities at low temperature ( see section 5 ) .",

    "the first rigorous result on the atomic limit has been established by fefferman @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) . screened cluster expansions allow us to recover immediately ideal terms associated with free protons , free electrons and atoms @xmath5 .",
    "all other contributions are shown to decay exponentially faster in the saha regime .",
    "for instance , the ideal contribution ( [ sixcinq ] ) of molecules @xmath6 is smaller than ( [ sixquatre ] ) by factor @xmath489 \\sim \\exp [ \\beta ( 3e_h - e_{h_2})]$ ] ( for @xmath490 close to @xmath491 ) , which indeed exponentially vanishes at zero temperature since @xmath492 : though molecule @xmath6 is more stable than two atoms @xmath5 ( @xmath493 ) , entropy dissociation overcomes energy minimization in the present very dilute regime .",
    "moreover , detailed analysis of graphs @xmath4 provide exact estimations of various corrections to ideal leading terms at finite ( low ) temperature and density .",
    "such corrections arise from excited bound states of atoms @xmath5 , thermal and entropy dissociation , recombination into other complex entities ( @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , ... ) , screening , interactions between entities , diffraction and exchange ( all entities behave as almost classical particles ) .",
    "those results will be published elsewhere @xcite .    for the hydrogen plasma in saha regime , particle correlations have been determined @xcite by using screened cluster expansion ( [ cinqvingthuit ] ) .",
    "that analysis leads to the introduction of effective interactions between any entity , which all decay as @xmath494 at large relative distances @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , familiar van der waals forces between atoms @xmath5 do appear .",
    "at zero temperature , standard perturbation formula for two atoms in the vacuum is exactly recovered .",
    "corrections to that formula due to excited states and screening , are also calculated at finite temperature and density .",
    "the dielectric response of the hydrogen plasma in its atomic phase has been investigated with screened cluster formalism @xcite . that phase is defined within previous fefferman limit @xcite where @xmath490 is chosen slightly larger than @xmath491 :",
    "it reduces to an ideal mixture of atoms @xmath5 in their groundstate ( such phase may also be viewed as a particular saha regime where the fraction of ionized protons and electrons is arbitrarily small ) .",
    "the behaviour of wavenumber - dependent dielectric constant is analyzed by using expansion ( [ cinqvingthuit ] ) in linear response to an infinitesimal external charge .",
    "a cross - over phenomenon emerges , from a dielectric behaviour at wavenumbers much larger than @xmath495 , to a conductive behaviour at scales smaller than @xmath495 .",
    "conductive behaviour is due to a finite tiny amount of free charges that are always present at finite temperature and density ( here , screening length @xmath201 is much larger than the mean distance between atoms @xmath5 ) .",
    "the large plateau observed at scales larger than @xmath495 , leads to a natural definition of the ( finite ) dielectric constant for the atomic phase , independently of the presence of residual free charges .",
    "at zero temperature , the usual expression in terms of the polarizability of a single atom @xmath5 is then exactly recovered .",
    "previous examples confirm that screened cluster formalism is well suited for studying dilute regimes at low temperature .",
    "this concerns both conceptual problems for coulomb matter , like the existence of van der waals forces at finite temperature and finite density or the definition of a dielectric regime , and also derivation of exact asymptotic expressions for equilibrium quantities .",
    "all those various analysis can be applied to any partially ionized ( even neutral ) gas .",
    "in addition , screened cluster expansions provide a promising route for deriving either approximation schemes or effective models . both schemes and models",
    "might reasonably describe regimes with higher temperature and density , where analytic estimations are no longer possible .",
    "we derive various combinatorial properties for mayer graphs which are used in the transformations described in section 4 .",
    "these properties are related to the following central observation .",
    "let @xmath4 be an unlabelled mayer graph built with @xmath163 internal points @xmath496 , weights @xmath88 and bonds @xmath193 ( for our purpose it is unnecessary to take explicitly into account the root points ) .",
    "its contribution reads @xmath497_g \\big[\\prod f\\big]_g . \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath397 is its symmetry factor , i.e. the number of permutations of the @xmath163 internal points that leave unchanged the product of bonds @xmath498_{g_{lab}}$ ] associated with a labelled diagram @xmath499 with the same topological structure as that of @xmath4 .",
    "the number of different labelled diagrams @xmath499 is equal to @xmath500 .",
    "once all integrations over internal points @xmath501 have been performed , all contributions from different labelled diagrams are identical .",
    "thus , ( [ a1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath502_{g_{lab } } \\label{a2}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all different labelled diagrams @xmath499 with the given topological structure determined by @xmath4 .",
    "the transformation of ( [ a1 ] ) into ( [ a2 ] ) allows us to derive several useful identities as described below .",
    "if bond @xmath193 is decomposed into a sum , @xmath503 , contribution ( [ a1 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of that of graphs @xmath504 built with two kinds of bonds , @xmath292 and @xmath505 . replacing each bond @xmath506 by @xmath507 into ( [ a2 ] ) , we find a sum over labelled diagrams @xmath508 where the product of bonds reads @xmath509_{g_{lab}^{\\ast}}$ ] times @xmath510_{g_{lab}^{\\ast}}$ ] . obviously labelled diagrams @xmath508 do exhibit the topological properties of mayer graphs : they are connected , and two points are connected by at most one bond which is either @xmath292 or @xmath505 .",
    "all @xmath508 s have different products @xmath509_{g_{lab}^{\\ast } } [ \\prod h_{mn}]_{g_{lab}^{\\ast}}$ ] .",
    "they can be distributed into different classes where each class is defined by an unlabelled graph @xmath511 ( @xmath512 ) . in each class ,",
    "two different labelled diagrams @xmath508 can be inferred from each other by a permutation of labels of internal points , so there are @xmath513 such different labelled diagrams @xmath508 which all provide the same contribution after integration over the @xmath496 s .",

    "moreover @xmath515 is the usual symmetry factor defined as the number of permutations of internal points that leave the product @xmath509_{g_{lab}^{\\ast } } [ \\prod h_{mn}]_{g_{lab}^{\\ast}}$ ] unchanged for any labelled diagram @xmath508 associated with @xmath511 .",
    "the topological structures of graphs @xmath511 are inherited from that of @xmath4 : they only differ by number and position of bonds @xmath292 and @xmath505 . if we sum ( [ a3 ] ) over all possible mayer graphs @xmath4 , we then find the remarkable identity @xmath516_g \\big[\\prod f\\big]_g =   \\sum_{g^{\\ast}}{1 \\over s(g^{\\ast } ) } \\int \\big[\\prod \\dd x z(x)\\big]_{g^{\\ast } }   \\big[\\prod g\\big]_{g^{\\ast } } \\big[\\prod h\\big]_{g^{\\ast } } \\label{a4}\\ ] ] where both graphs @xmath4 and @xmath504 are built within the same mayer prescriptions .",
    "similarly to ( [ a4 ] ) , we can transform ( [ a1 ] ) when weight @xmath88 is decomposed as @xmath517 . again in ( [ a2 ] ) we replace each @xmath518 by @xmath519 .",
