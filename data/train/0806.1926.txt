    "topological quantum field theories ( tqfts ) emerged into physics and mathematics in the 1980s from the study of three distinct enigmas : the infrared limit of @xmath1 dimensional conformal field theories , the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , and the relation of the jones polynomial to @xmath2manifold topology . now 25 years on , about half the literature in @xmath2dimensional topology employs some @xmath3quantum `` view point , yet it is still difficult for people to learn what a tqft is and to manipulate the simplest examples .",
    "roughly ( axioms will follow later ) , a ( @xmath4dimensional tqft is a functor which associates a vector space @xmath5 called @xmath3modular functor '' to a closed oriented surface @xmath6 ( perhaps with some extra structures ) ; sends disjoint union to tensor product , orientation reversal to dual , and is natural with respect to transformations ( diffeomorphisms up to isotopy or perhaps a central extension of these ) of @xmath6 .",
    "the empty set @xmath7 is considered to be a manifold of each dimension : @xmath8 . as a closed surface ,",
    "the associated vector space is @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "also if @xmath11 , @xmath12 an oriented @xmath2manifold ( also perhaps with some extra structure ) , then a vector @xmath13 is determined ( surfaces @xmath6 with boundary also play a role but we pass over this for now . ) a closed @xmath2manifold @xmath12 determines a vector @xmath14 , that is a number . in the case",
    "@xmath12 is the @xmath2sphere with @xmath3extra structure `` a link @xmath15 , then witten s @xmath16family '' of tqfts yields a jones polynomial evaluation @xmath17 , @xmath18 as the @xmath3closed @xmath2manifold `` invariants , which mathematically are the reshetikhin - turaev invariants based on quantum groups @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this is the best known example .",
    "note that physicists tend to index the same family by the levels @xmath19 .",
    "the shift @xmath20 is the dual coxeter number of @xmath21 .",
    "we will use both indices .",
    "most of the @xmath3quantum '' literature in topology focuses on such closed @xmath2manifold invariants but there has been a growing awareness that a deeper understanding is locked up in the representation spaces @xmath5 and the @xmath3higher algebras `` associated to boundary @xmath22 ( circles ) and points @xcite@xcite .",
    "let us explain this last statement . while invariants of @xmath2manifolds may be fascinating in their interrelations there is something of a shortage of work for them within topology .",
    "reidemeister was probably the last topologist to be seriously puzzled as to whether a certain pair of @xmath2manifolds were the same or different and , famously , solved his problem by the invention of @xmath3torsion '' .",
    "( in four dimensions the situation is quite the opposite , and the closed manifold information from @xmath23 dimensional tqfts would be most welcome .",
    "but in this dimension , we do not yet know interesting examples of tqfts . )",
    "so while the subject in dimension @xmath24 seems to be maturing away from the closed case it is running into a pedological difficulty .",
    "it is hard to develop a solid understanding of the vector spaces @xmath5 even for simple examples .",
    "our goal in these notes is , in a few simple examples to provide an intuition and understanding on the same level of @xmath3admissible pictures `` modulo relations , just as we understand homology as cycles modulo boundaries .",
    "this is the meaning of @xmath3picture '' in the title .",
    "a picture tqft is one where @xmath5 is the space of formal @xmath25linear combinations of @xmath3admissible `` pictures drawn on @xmath6 modulo some ( i.e. on a disk ) linear relations .",
    "we will use the terms formal links , or formal tangles , or formal pictures , etc . to mean @xmath9-linear combinations of links , tangles , pictures , etc .",
    "formal tangles in @xmath24-manifolds are also commonly referred to as @xmath3skein ' 's .",
    "equivalently , we can adopt a dual point of view : take the space of linear functionals on multicurves and impose linear constraints for functionals .",
    "this point of view is closer to the physical idea of @xmath3amplitude of an eigenstate \" : think of a functional @xmath26 as a wavefunction and its value @xmath27 on a multicurve @xmath28 as as the amplitude of the eigenstate @xmath28 .",
    "then quotient spaces of pictures become subspaces of wavefunctions .",
    "experts may note that central charge @xmath29 is an obstruction to this @xmath3picture formulation `` : the mapping class group @xmath30 acts directly on pictures and so induces an action on any @xmath5 defined by pictures . as @xmath31 determines a central extension @xmath32 which acts in place of @xmath30 , the feeling that all interesting theories must have @xmath33 may have discouraged a pictorial approach .",
    "however this is not true : for any @xmath5 its endomorphism algebra end @xmath34 has central charge @xmath35 and remembers the original projective representation faithfully .",
    "in fact , all our examples are either of this form or slightly more subtle quantum doubles or drinfeld centers in which the original theory @xmath36 violates some axiom ( the nonsingularity of the @xmath37matrix ) but this deficiency is @xmath3cured '' by doubling @xcite@xcite .",
    "although those notes focus on picture tqfts based on variations of the jones - wenzl projectors , the approach can be generalized to an arbitrary spherical tensor category .",
    "the temperley - lieb categories are generated by a single @xmath3fundamental \" representation , and all fusion spaces are of dimension @xmath38 or @xmath39 , so pictures are just @xmath39-manifolds . in general , @xmath39-manifolds need to be replaced by tri - valent graphs whose edges carry labels . but @xmath40 is not sufficient for a tqft to have a picture description . given any two tqfts with opposite central charges , their product has @xmath40 , e.g. tqfts with @xmath41 fusion rules have @xmath42 , so the product of any theory with the mirror of a different one has @xmath40 , but such a product theory does not have a picture description in our sense .    while these notes describe the mathematical side of the story , we have avoided jargon which might throw off readers from physics .",
    "when different terminologies prevail within mathematics and physics we will try to note both . within physics ,",
    "tqfts are referred to as @xmath3anyonic systems `` @xcite@xcite .",
    "these are @xmath20-dimensional quantum mechanical systems with point like excitations ( variously called @xmath3quas - particle '' or just @xmath3particle `` , anyon , or perhaps @xmath3nonabelion '' ) which under exchange exhibit exotic statistics : a nontrival representation of the braid groups acting on a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath36 consisting of @xmath3internal degrees of freedom `` . since these @xmath3internal degrees of freedom '' sound mysterious , we note that this information is accessed by fusion : fuse pairs of anyons along a well defined trajectory and observe the outcome .",
    "anyons are a feature of the fractional quantum hall effect ; laughlin s 1998 nobel prize was for the prediction of an anyon carrying change @xmath43 and with braiding statistics @xmath44 . in the fqhe central charge @xmath29",
    "is enforced by a symmetry breaking magnetic field b. it is argued in @xcite that solid state realizations of doubled or @xmath3picture `` tqfts may - if found - be more stable ( larger spectral gap above the degenerate ground state manifold ) because no symmetry breaking is required .",
    "the important electron - electron interactions would be at a lattice spacing scale @xmath45 rather than at a @xmath3magnetic length '' typically around @xmath46 .",
    "so it is hoped that the examples which are the subject of these notes will be the low energy limits of certain microscopic solid state models .",
    "picture tqfts have a hamiltonian formulation , and describe string - net condensation in physics , which serve as a classification of non - chiral topological phases of matter .",
    "an interesting mathematical application is the proof of the asymptotic faithfulness of the representations of the mapping class groups .    as mentioned above",
    ", these notes are primarily about examples either of the form @xmath47 or with a related but more general doubled structure @xmath48 . in choosing a path through this material",
    "there seemed a basic choice : ( 1 ) present the picture ( doubled ) theories in a self contained way in two dimensions with no reference to their twisted @xmath49 and less tractable parent theories @xmath36 or ( 2 ) weave the stories of @xmath48 and @xmath36 together from the start and exploit the action of @xmath48 on @xmath36 in analyzing the structure of @xmath48 . in the end , the choice was made for us : we did not succeed in finding purely combinatorial @xmath3picture - proofs \" for all the necessary lemmas  the action on @xmath36 is indeed very useful so we follow course ( 2 )",
    ". we do recommend to some interested brave reader that she produce her own article hewing to course ( 1 ) .    in the literature",
    "@xcite comes closest to the goals of the notes , and @xcite exploits deeply the picture theories in many directions .",
    "actually , a large part of the notes will follow from a finished @xcite . if one applies the set up of [ bhmv ] to skeins in surface cross interval , @xmath50 , and then resolves crossings to get a formal linear combination of @xmath51submanifolds of @xmath52 one arrives at ( an example of ) the  pictures \" we study . in",
    "this doubled context there is no need for the @xmath53structure ( or  two - framing \" ) intrinsic to the other approaches . to readers familiar with @xcite one",

    "we produce many examples , and in the temperley - lieb - jones context give a complete analysis of the possible local relations .",
    "experts have long been troubled by certain sign discrepancies between the @xmath37matrix arising from representations ( or loop groups or quantum groups)@xcite@xcite@xcite on the one hand and from the kauffman bracket on the other @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the source of the discrepancy is that the fundamental representation of @xmath21 is anti - symmetrically self dual whereas there is no room in kauffman s spin - network notation to record the antisymmetry .",
    "we rectify this by amplifying the pictures slightly , which yields the modular functor @xmath36 coming from representation theory of @xmath57 .",
