    "a variety of surface and near - surface thermodynamic and lattice dynamical phenomena are governed by the phonon density of states ( dos ) , the number of vibrational modes per unit frequency , per unit volume of solid . in an inhomogeneous system , however , it is possible to distinguish between the `` global '' dos , which makes reference to only to the vibrational - mode frequencies of the entire system , and a local , eigenfunction - weighted dos . in systems with a small _ mechanical _ surface - to - volume ratio ,",
