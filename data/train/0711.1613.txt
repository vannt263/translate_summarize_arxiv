    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations pointing towards the existence of non - vanishing neutrino masses and large leptonic mixing has rendered the flavour puzzle even more intriguing .",
    "there have been many attempts at understanding the pattern of leptonic masses and mixing  @xcite , including the introduction of either abelian or non - abelian flavour symmetries , some of them leading to texture zeros in the fermion mass matrices . in the leptonic sector",
    "there is an extra motivation for introducing texture zeros , namely the fact that without an appeal to theory , it is not possible to fully reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 from experimental input arising from feasible experiments .",
    "it has been shown that this is possible if one postulates the presence of texture zeros in @xmath0  @xcite or if one assumes that @xmath1 vanishes  @xcite .    a difficulty one encounters in an attempt at making a systematic study of experimentally viable texture zeros results from the fact that some sets of these zeros have , by themselves , no physical meaning , since they can be obtained starting from arbitrary fermion mass matrices , by making appropriate weak basis ( wb ) transformations which leave the gauge currents flavour diagonal  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate in detail what are the texture zeros which can be obtained in the leptonic sector with majorana neutrinos through wb transformations .",
    "we then analyse the physical implications of anstze where the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath2 and the effective majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 have the same structure ( we denote them `` parallel anstze '' ) , with a total of four independent zeros",
    ". these anstze do have physical meaning , since not all their texture zeros can be simultaneously obtained through wb transformations .",
    "although there is no universal principle requiring parallel structures , they certainly have an easthetical appeal and naturally arise in some classes of family symmetries as well as in the framework of some grand - unified theories  @xcite .",
    "this letter is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show that starting from arbitrary structures for the leptonic mass matrices it is possible to obtain , through wb transformations , @xmath2 hermitian with a texture zero in the @xmath3 position while @xmath0 ( which is symmetric due to its assumed majorana nature ) has zeros in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 entries . in section [ sec - zt ] ,",
    "we analyse four - zero parallel anstze , showing that they can be divided into four different classes . in section [ sec-4z ]",
    "we confront these anstze with the present experimental data and analyse their predictions .",
    "finally , in the last section we draw our conclusions .",
    "we assume the standard model with left - handed neutrinos together with some unspecified mechanism leading to lepton - number violation and the generation of a left - handed majorana mass for neutrinos . the most general wb transformation which leaves the gauge currents",
    "invariant is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xmath8 unitary matrices , while @xmath2 , @xmath0 denote the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , respectively .",
    "it is possible to make a wb transformation which renders @xmath2 real and diagonal . in this basis",
    ", one has : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real diagonal matrices .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath12 is the so - called pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix  @xcite which can be parametrised as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 ; @xmath16 are mixing angles and @xmath17 is cp - violating dirac phase .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath18 contains the majorana phases , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , which have physical meaning only if light neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "although majorana phases do not affect neutrino oscillations , they do play a rle in neutrinoless double beta decay , contributing to so - called effective majorana mass  @xcite @xmath21      our goal is to investigate whether it is always possible to find a wb transformation which , starting from arbitrary matrices @xmath2 and @xmath0 , in the basis given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pwb ] ) , leads to new matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that @xmath24 and @xmath2 hermitian . in this case , the wb transformations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wbt ] ) are restricted to those with @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath26    the requirement that @xmath27 and @xmath28 vanish leads to the conditions @xmath29 m_1\\,x_{11}^2+m_2\\,x_{21}^2+m_3\\,x_{31}^2=0\\ , , \\label{eq : zb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zb ] ) are given by @xmath32 it is clear that in order for eq .",
    "( [ eq : za ] ) to have a solution , one of the masses @xmath33 , @xmath34 or @xmath35 must have a sign opposite to the other two .",
    "this requirement can be always fulfilled , since the sign of a dirac fermion mass can always be changed by making an appropriate chiral transformation . in order for eq .",
    "( [ eq : zb ] ) to have a solution , the three real non - negative quantities @xmath36 should be such that a triangle can be formed with sides @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for them to be the sides of a triangle is that : @xmath40 given @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath12 , a solution to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : za ] ) and ( [ eq : zb ] ) can be found through the following procedure :    1 .",
    "find @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : za ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is clear that this is always possible .",
    "one can parametrise the first column of @xmath6 as @xmath46 then a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : za ] ) can be found by adjusting the angles @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "2 .    3 .   in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : zb ] ) , one has to choose @xmath6 in such a way that the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tri ] ) is verified .",
    "finding a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zb ] ) is then equivalent to the problem of determining the internal angles of a triangle from the knowledge of its sides .",
    "if we denote @xmath49 , the internal angles of the triangle are given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "once the zero in the position ( 1,1 ) is obtained , a natural question to ask is whether one can get additional wb zeros while keeping @xmath2 hermitian .",
    "it can be readily seen that there exists a second wb transformation that keeps @xmath24 and leads either to @xmath52 or to @xmath53 .",
    "such a transformation is defined by the unitary matrix @xmath54 with @xmath47 and @xmath55 given by @xmath56 similarly , it is also possible to perform a wb transformation analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : secu ] ) such that one obtains the second zero in the position ( 1,2 ) . in this case",
    ", the following relations hold @xmath57    to illustrate numerically this procedure , we take a tri - bimaximal structure for the pmns matrix , which as shown by harrison , perkins and scott ( hps )  @xcite is consistent with neutrino oscillation data . in this case , the neutrino mixing matrix has the following form : @xmath58 corresponding to @xmath59 bimaximally mixed and @xmath60 trimaximally mixed .",
    "since @xmath61 , there is no dirac - type cp violation in this scheme .",

    "( [ eq : secu ] ) and ( [ eq : secu1 ] ) , the lepton mass matrices become @xmath69 therefore , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ex ] ) shows the explicit form of the leptonic mass matrices leading to the hps structure , in the wb with texture zeros in the elements @xmath3 of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 of @xmath0 .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that through wb transformations one can obtain three independent texture zeros in the leptonic mass matrices , while maintaining @xmath70 hermitian .",
    "we address now the question whether it is possible to keep @xmath2 hermitian and , simultaneously , obtain additional zeros through wb transformations .",
    "we will show that this is not possible , thus implying that the assumption of any additional zero does have physical implications .    to be specific ,",
    "let us investigate whether starting from arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath0 one can make a wb transformation , so that these matrices are put in the form @xmath71 with @xmath2 hermitian . to prove that this is not possible , let us count the number of independent parameters in these matrices . by making the rephasing @xmath72 with @xmath73 ,",
    "it is straightforward to verify that one can choose @xmath74 so that @xmath2 becomes real .",
    "one has still some freedom left , so that one phase in @xmath0 is also eliminated . in this way ,",
    "one is left with four real parameters in @xmath2 and four real parameters plus three phases in @xmath0 .",
    "so altogether one has eleven free parameters in the matrices @xmath2 and @xmath0 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4tz ] ) . on the other hand , in the leptonic sector with three generations of majorana neutrinos",
    ", there is a total of twelve physical parameters ( _ i.e. _ six lepton masses , three mixing angles and three phases ) .    from the above",
    "simple counting one sees that , in general , the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4tz ] ) , with @xmath2 hermitian , can not be obtained through wb transformations , starting from arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath0 matrices .",
    "this in turn implies that the ansatz of eq .",

    "if one relaxes the hermiticity condition of @xmath2 , one can show that the parallel structure given in eq .",

    "( [ eq : wbt ] ) with @xmath75 . in this case , the total number of free parameters is fourteen and additional assumptions would be necessary to gain predictability .",

    "we have emphasised that in any search for the experimentally viable texture - zero structures for fermion mass matrices , it is crucial to take into account the freedom to make wb transformations which do not change the physical content of a given structure but alter its form . in the case of the leptonic sector with majorana neutrinos , we have investigated what zeros can be obtained , starting from arbitrary mass matrices for charged leptons and neutrinos , using the freedom to make wb transformations .",
    "in particular , we have shown that without loss of generality , one can choose a wb where @xmath2 is hermitian and @xmath2 , @xmath0 contain a total of three independent texture - zeros .",
