    "transient low - mass black hole x - ray binaries show distinct changes of their spectral and variability properties as they evolve during an outburst , that are interpreted as evidence for changes in the accretion flow and x - ray emitting regions .",
    "this behavior can be classified by different phenomenological states through which the black hole transient ( bht ) evolves during an outburst . at the beginning of a typical outburst bhts",
    "are usually in the low hard state ( lhs ) where their power density spectra ( pds ) are dominated by band - limited noise ( bln ) on which narrow quasi - periodic features ( quasi - periodic oscillations ; qpos ) are superimposed . during the evolution through the lhs and into the hard intermediate state ( hims ) the amplitude as well as the centroid frequency of the qpos increases . in the energy range covered by the rxte / pca detector (  @xmath02 kev )",
    "the pds show a smooth transition from the lhs to the hims .",
    "this picture changes dramatically when softer energies are included , as they reveal the existence of two distinct power spectral states at soft and hard x - rays with the onset of the hims @xcite .",
    "the transition to the soft intermediate state ( sims ) is marked by the appearance of another type of qpo , and an overall fractional rms in the 5  10 per cent interval @xcite . in the high soft state ( hss )",
    "the variability is even lower and the pds is dominated by power - law noise . after experiencing a substantial decrease in luminosity during the hss the bht returns back to the lhs again usually passing the hims and sims @xcite .    in the lhs",
    "the x - ray emission is very noisy and the fractional rms can reach values up to 4050 per cent .",
    "the first detection of a difference in time scales between the soft and hard flux from a bht was found in observations of the hims of gs112468 andgx 3394 obtained with ginga .the shape of the pds , which is dominated by bln , can be fitted with a combination of lorentzian components @xcite .",
    "four main components have been identified ( 0.001 @xmath1 a few 100 hz ) : a low - frequency one fitting the flat - top part , a peaked ( sometimes qpo - like ) component , and two broad lorentzians at higher frequencies .",
    "these components are characterized by their characteristic frequency and by the amount of variability they contribute , where the latter one is measured as factional rms .",
    "studying the fractional rms as a function of energy ( the `` rms spectrum '' ) it was shown that it is either flat or decreases by a few per cent in the energy range covered by rxte / pca ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this shape has been interpreted in the framework of comptonization models @xcite .",
    "using covariance spectra and ratios obtained from  data , an increased disc blackbody variability with respect to the comptonized emission was detected below 1 kev at time scales longer than one second , while on shorter time scales the disc variability is driven by variability of the comptonized component , consistent with propagating models modified by disc heating at short time scales @xcite .",
    "in addition to the bln component type - c qpos @xcite can be present .",
    "they can be observed over a relatively large range of frequencies  roughly from 0.01 to 30 hz  and their fractional rms is of the oder of 3  15 per cent .    in recent years",
    "much work has gone into developing and exploring models to describe qpos and noise components .",
    "an excellent summary of these models can be found in the extensive recent review of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also references therein ) .",
    "bln can be explained within the `` propagating fluctuation '' model @xcite , where variability is caused by variations in the mass accretion rate which propagate through the disc , so that shorter time - scale variations either from coronal flares or fluctuation in the mass accretion rate or similar processes in the inner parts of the disc are superimposed on longer time - scale variations from further out .",
    "bln is also seen in neutron star low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "likely indicators of the orbital frequency in the innermost accretion flow such as the khz qpo frequency in neutron star low mass x - ray binaries are found to vary with the flux corresponding to the time scale of the bln in a manner similar to that established for variability on longer time scales which is due to modulation in the mass accretion rate , providing an independent evidence that the bln corresponds to the modulation in the mass accretion rate which causes changes in the inner edge or characteristic frequencies in the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we study the variability properties of the characteristic frequency and variability amplitude of the bln in different energy bands during the lhs for a sample of bhts .",
    "we used observations of gx3394 , h1743322 , xtej1650500 , xtej1752223 , and swiftj1753.50127 .",
    "details on the individual observations are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "all observations were taken during the lhs .",
    "we filtered and extracted the pn event files , using standard sas ( version 13.0.0 ) tools , paying particular attention to extract the list of photons not randomized in time . for our study",
    "we selected the longest , continuous exposure available in each observation ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we used the sas task ` epatplot ` to investigate whether the observations are affected by pile - up , and in the case of pile - up excluded the column(s ) with the highest count rate until the selection results in an observed pattern distribution that follows the theoretical prediction quite nicely .",
    "we selected single and double events ( pattern@xmath24 ) for our study .",
    "we extracted power density spectra ( pds ) in two different energy bands , namely 1  2 and 4  8 kev . after verifying that the noise level at frequencies above 30  hz is consistent with the one expected for poissonian noise @xcite",
    ", we subtracted the contribution due to poissonian noise , normalised the pds according to @xcite and converted to square fractional rms .",
    "the pds were fitted with models composed of zero - centered lorentzians for bln components , and lorentzians for qpos .",
    "the resulting power spectra in the two energy bands thus contain only source variability and can be compared with each other .",
    "in addition , we derived rms spectra for each component of the pds using the amplitude ( normalisation ) of the lorentzians . furthermore , we derived covariance spectra following the approach described in @xcite . to study variability on shorter time scales we used 0.1  s time bins measured in segments of 4  s. for longer time scales 2.7  s time bins in segments of 270  s were used . as reference band we used the energy range between 1 and 4 kev , taking care to exclude energies from the reference band that are in the channel of interest .",
    "we extracted energy spectra of all observations , using the rawx values given in table  [ tab : obs ] for the source spectra . to extract background spectra we used columns 3@xmath3rawx@xmath35 . in the case of burst mode observations we used rawy @xmath4 140 following the procedure outlined in .",
    "we payed special attention to generate arf files of the pile - up corrected source region , following the steps laid down in the  users guide .",
    "as it is known that energy spectra obtained form  epic - pn fast - readout modes can be affected by gain shift due to charge - transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , which leads to an apparent shift of the instrumental edges visible at low energies , we also generated spectra applying the sas task epfast to the data .",
    "apart form the observation of 1743  no significant changes between the energy spectra obtained with and without epfast are noticeable at low energies , and a residual feature at @xmath52 kev , related to small shifts in energy gain at the si - k and au - m edges of the instrumental response , remains present in the data obtained with epfast @xcite . as there are no significant changes of the energy spectra at low energies and as epfast leads to an over - correction of the cti at higher energies ( see   * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we fitted the spectra obtained without epfast and limited our spectral study to the 1  10 kev energy range .",

    "our investigations of the characteristic frequency of the band limited noise in a hard and soft energy band revealed that for observations where the ratio of the disc blackbody flux to the flux of the comptonized component in the soft band exceeded @xmath510% , the band limited noise component with the highest characteristic frequency shows a lower characteristic frequency in the soft band compared to the one observed in the hard band .",
    "the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency is more obvious at characteristic frequencies above 1 hz in the hard band .",

    "[ fig : pds ] ) .",
    "in addition to the pds @xcite also showed rms spectra for different states . in their study of xtej1650 - 500 and xtej1550 - 564 they observed flat rms spectra and an rms slightly decreasing with increasing energy in the lhs .",
    "we found a similar behaviour in the observations of 339 , 1743 , and the september 2012 observation of swiftj1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "the behaviour of the rms observed in the remaining observations of swiftj1753.5 - 0127 corresponds to the one of the hims in the @xcite study",
    ".    the observed energy dependence of the characteristic frequency which is more obvious at characteristic frequencies above 1 hz in the hard band can be either explained by variable seed photon input for the comptonized photons in different energy bands @xcite or by x - ray heating of the accretion disc caused by the reprocessing of comptonized photons @xcite .",
    "the variability properties observed in our study show characteristics of variability associated with comptonized photons down to the lowest observed energies ,  that the pds can be described by bln and qpos in all energy bands and that a power - law shape observed in the hss when disc variability dominates in not needed .",
    "the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency suggests that the seed photon input for the comptonized photons varies between different energy bands , as has been discussed in @xcite based on rxte data .",
    "it is therefore expected that such an effect would become more obvious when the corona is cooled down and the electron temperature is getting lower . thus the energy dependence becomes more obvious in narrower energy bands .",
    "the presence of the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency can be interpreted within the picture where the photons in the soft and hard energy bands come from different locations in the system .",
    "a schematic sketch of this picture , which was also used in our recent studies @xcite , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "when the thermal disc component emerges in the soft band of  but does not dominate , a significant number of photons in the soft energy band will still come from the comptonization component ( originating either from an optically thin hot corona ( see * ? ? ? * ) or from a jet flow ( see * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "however , the soft band photons should origin further away from the black hole than the hard band ones and thus suffer less up - scattering .",
    "this brings lower characteristic frequencies and softer energies together .",
    "the change of the characteristic frequency can be interpreted as a hint of a temperature gradient in the comptonization component .",
    "the observation that the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency is mainly observed at higher frequencies ( @xmath01 hz ) can be interpreted as a moving in of the inner disc radius during outburst evolution . in early outburst stages",
    "the disc ends far away from the black hole and the characteristic frequency , which is below 1 hz , is consistent between both bands , since the photons in both bands experience a similar number of scatterings . with ongoing evolution of the outburst the boundary region between the disc and",
    "the comptonizing corona moves inwards and the characteristic frequency as well as the contribution of the direct disc emission in the soft band increases @xcite .",
    "notice that the radius at which the cold disc ends may be not the radius at which the cold disc terminates , since a hot flow or corona would cover the innermost cold disc so the radius one determines from the cut - off frequency of the power - law noise would correspond to the radius to which the hot flow or corona extends ( while the disc can reach down to the isco as assumed  in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interpreting the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency by additional intrinsic disc variability at low energies is not a convincing alternative , as intrinsic disc variability contributes at low frequencies @xcite while the observed energy dependence of the characteristic frequency is more pronounced at frequencies above 1 hz . in addition , the subsample of observations that show an increased covariance ratio at low energies does not agree with the subsample of observations that show the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency .",
    "we would like to point out that the additional disc variability on long time scales shows up only in the covariance spectra and ratios , but that there is no hint of an additional disc component in the pds at low energies .",
    "as pds fitting does not require any disc variability ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : time_prop ] ) , we can exclude that the observed energy dependence of the characteristic frequency is caused by underlying disc variability not taken into account properly during pds fitting .",
    "thus we prefer to interpret the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency to be caused by variable seed photon input for the comptonized photons in different energy bands .",
    "a challenge to our interpretation might be the observations of xte j1650@xmath72500 and xte j1752@xmath72223 . in both observations",
    "the contribution of the disc emission to the overall emission in the soft band exceeds 50 per cent , and based on the results obtained in @xcite and @xcite we would expect that the sources are in the hard intermediate state .",
    "the fact that the signal - to - noise ratio at higher energies is lower in these two observations compared to the other observations used in this study can not explain why the contribution of the disc emission to the overall emission in the soft band exceeds 50 per cent , as taking the error bars on the spectral parameters into account does not affect the flux ratio to always exceed 50 per cent .",
    "we notice that for these two observations the variability amplitude in the softest band is lower than the variability amplitude at higher energies .",
    "furthermore , fitting of the covariance spectra of these two sources does not require a high - energy cut - off and the photon indices and inner disc temperatures obtained from the covariance spectra are larger than those obtained from the mean energy spectra . for xte j1752@xmath72223",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that xte j1752@xmath72223 is observed during outburst decay returning to the lhs , while the results of @xcite and @xcite are based on the evolution from the hard to the soft state . in the case of xte j1650@xmath72500 , it is more difficult to find an explanation as the source is observed during outburst rise when it evolves from the lhs to the hss .",
    "a possible explanation can be that in this source the contribution of the disc emission to the soft band is in general higher than in those sources studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a thorough investigation of this possibility as well as a detailed study of the differences between outburst rise and decay will be the targets of future studies .",
    "please notice that in these two observations the signal - to - noise ratio at higher energies is lower compared to the other observations used in this study .",
    "however , the lower signal - to - noise ratio can not explain why the contribution of the disc emission to the overall emission in the soft band exceeds 50 per cent .",
    "regarding the absence of correlations between the characteristic frequencies in different energy bands and between the characteristic frequency and spectral parameters , it is mainly the data points of 339  with well constraint parameters that do not agree with possible trends seen in the remaining data points with bigger uncertainties .",
    "higher quality data that would allow to constrain the characteristic frequency more precisely would be helpful to foster the absence of correlations .    in conclusion",
    ", the energy dependence of the break frequency of the band - limited noise component supports a picture that the power spectra in black hole x - ray binaries depend on which spectral components we are looking at .",
    "energy - resolved timing observations can be sensitive enough to trace not only the accretion geometry by detecting power - law noise as evidence of the emergence of a disc component but can also probe the properties of the corona from studies of the band - limited noise break frequency . in this work we provide evidence that the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency may be used to probe the extension of the corona .",
