    "first we focus on the 1/3 magnetization plateau that appears only for the mn analogues , not for the ni and co analogues .",

    "therefore , the present compound cani@xmath0p@xmath1o@xmath2  becomes an effective @xmath9 =3 ferromagnetic chain , whose excitations are gapless spin waves .",
    "this is in contrast to the prediction of afm trimer system @xcite where the excitations are gapped . on the other hand , two magnetization plateaus at 1/3 and 2/3 of the saturation magnetization",
    "are classically expected for @xmath9 = 1 fm trimer chains when the fm trimers ( @xmath13 fm ) are coupled antiferromagnetically ( @xmath14 afm ) , and the ratio @xmath14/@xmath13 is above a critical value @xcite . however , for the present compound cani@xmath0p@xmath1o@xmath2 both the intratrimer interaction @xmath13 , and intertrimer interaction @xmath14 are fm ; hence , no magnetization plateau is observed .",
    "in addition to the fm intratrimer and intertrimer interactions along the chain axis , the interchain interaction is also reasonably strong in cani@xmath0p@xmath1o@xmath2 , as estimated by the first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "the consequence of the strong interchain interaction in the present cani@xmath0p@xmath1o@xmath2  compound is revealed by the observed higher 3d long - range magnetic ordering temperature of @xmath8=16  k as compared to the mn - based compound ( @xmath21 = 2.2  k ) @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the stronger interchain interactions is the value of ordered moments . for the present ni - based compound with stronger interchain interaction @xmath100 ; [ @xmath100/((@xmath13+@xmath14)/2 ) @xmath37 1 ] @xcite , the ordered moment values ( 1.98 and 1.96  @xmath10 )",

    ", short - range spin - spin correlations develop below @xmath750  k. with further lowering of temperature , a 3d long - range magnetic ordering sets in below @xmath8 = 16  k. above @xmath8 , the short - range magnetic ordering has 1d magnetic characteristics with dominating fm spin - spin correlations along the chain axis ( @xmath3 axis ) .",

    "the moment components along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 axes are arranged antiferromagnetically .",
    "the observed magnetic structure is consistent with the first - principles calculations which estimate both the intratrimer and intertrimer interactions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as fm . in the studied compound",
    ", a net magnetization per unit cell arises due to the uncompensated moment components along the @xmath3 axis , in contrast to the ferrimagnetic ordering reported earlier from the mc analysis of bulk magnetization .",
    "the present understanding of the magnetic ground state also explains the reason behind the absence of the 1/3 magnetization plateau in cani@xmath0p@xmath1o@xmath2  in contrast to the isostructural mn - compounds .",
    "the ordered moment values for both the magnetic sites [ 4@xmath35 ni(1 ) and 2@xmath4 ni(2 ) ] are found to be @xmath7 2  @xmath10/ni@xmath11 at 1.5  k. the present system is found to be a good realization of a 3d magnetic system with @xmath9 = 1 trimer chains .",
