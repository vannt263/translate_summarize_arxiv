    "quasars lensed by foreground clusters of galaxies serve as a powerful probe of the mass distributions of clusters . sdss j1004 +",
    "4112 is the first example of such quasar - cluster lens systems @xcite .",
    "it consists of four bright quasar images ( @xmath10 ) with a maximum image separation of @xmath11 produced by a massive cluster at @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to the quasar images , multiply - imaged background galaxies are also observed @xcite .",
    "an advantage for using lensed quasars is that they can provide time delays , which have been actually detected for this system @xcite , containing unique information on the lens potential .",
    "what makes the quasar lens sdss  j1004 + 4112 particularly unique is the probable central fifth image ( component e ) of the lensed quasar system .",
    "high - resolution _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ advanced camera for survey ( acs ; @xcite ) images show a blue point source located @xmath13 from the center of the brightest cluster galaxy g1 @xcite .",
    "the central lensed image , if confirmed , has several important implications for the central structure of lensing objects .",
    "for instance , central images can constrain the inner mass profiles of lensing galaxies , particularly the masses of the central supermassive black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . while the correlation between the black hole mass ( @xmath2 ) and the stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath4 ) of the host galaxies has been established for local galaxies @xcite , measurements of the redshift evolution for the correlation , derived for galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei , are still controversial ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus independent constraints from central images are thought to provide insights into this relation .    in this _ letter _ , we present results of two deep spectroscopic follow - up observations for sdss j1004 + 4112 , conducted at the subaru 8.2-meter telescope .",
    "one is spectroscopy of component e to confirm its lensing nature , and the other is spectroscopy of galaxy g1 to measure its velocity dispersion .",
    "the latter observation is particularly important in separating the mass distribution of dark matter from that of baryons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then attempt mass modeling of the lens system .",
    "together with the measurement of @xmath4 for galaxy g1 , it provides a direct constraint on the @xmath2-@xmath4 relation at the lens redshift of @xmath12 . in what follows ,",
    "we assume a standard flat universe with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( 60mm,60mm)fig1.eps      we conducted spectroscopic observations of the central fifth image ( component e ; see figure [ fig:1004b ] ) with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) at the subaru 8.2-meter telescope on 2007 january 22 .",
    "we used the 300b grism , the l600 filter , and a @xmath17-width slit , under the 2@xmath182 ( spatial@xmath18spectral ) on - chip binning mode . with this configuration",
    "the wavelength coverage is from 3650 to 6000 , which covers a strong emission line ( c ) of the lensed quasar with a spectral resolution of @xmath19 and a pixel scale of @xmath20 pixel@xmath1 .",
    "although component e is quite close to the center of galaxy g1 at @xmath12 ( @xmath13 from the center of g1 ) , our blue spectroscopy minimizes the contamination from g1 .",
    "the slit direction was aligned to pass through component d ( @xmath21 from component e , see figure [ fig:1004b ] ) of sdss j1004 + 4112 which we adopt as a reference for the quasar emission lines . given the faintness ( @xmath22 ) of component e , we used a total exposure time of 16,200  sec taken in excellent seeing conditions ( fwhm of @xmath23 ) . after removing cosmic rays using the lacos_spec task @xcite , we extracted 1-dimensional spectra of components e and d using the standard iraf tasks .",
    "the spectra , normalized by the continuum level of each image , are shown in figure [ fig:1d_de ] .",
    "we find that the spectrum of component e shows a clear emission line just at the wavelength of the c emission line of component d. we note that there is no sky emission line near the wavelength of the c emission line ( 4200 ) .",
    "thus our spectroscopic observations unambiguously confirm that component e is the central fifth image of the lens system , representing the first spectroscopic confirmation of central odd images among lensed quasars .",
    "( 60mm,60mm)fig2.eps      to measure the velocity dispersion of galaxy g1 , we also used focas but with a different setup .",
    "we adopted the 600 - 650 vph grism ( high 650 ) , the sy47 filter , and a @xmath24-width slit .",
    "the wavelength coverage in this setup is from 5300 to 7700 , covering the ca h&k and g - band absorption lines of galaxy g1 at @xmath12 .",
    "the slit direction was aligned along the major axis of galaxy g1 ( 160.8 deg east of north ) .",
    "the spectrum , with a total exposure of 21,600  sec , was obtained on 2007 january 21 , under the 3@xmath181 on - chip binning mode ( a spatial scale of @xmath25 pixel@xmath1 ) .",
    "the setup was chosen to achieve a spectral resolution of @xmath26 .",
    "the seeing was @xmath27 fwhm .",
    "again , cosmic rays were removed by the lacos_spec task and the 1-dimensional spectrum of galaxy g1 was extracted by the standard iraf tasks .",
    "we measure the velocity dispersion of g1 following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we adopted hd  8491 , hd  83085 , hd  94247 , and hd  126778 in the coud feed spectral library @xcite as template stars .",
    "we rebinned and smoothed the template spectra to match the observed spectral resolutions of our data .",
    "both the spectrum of g1 and the resolution - matched template stars are normalized by the continuum levels .",
    "we then apply the fourier cross - correlation method @xcite of the iraf fxcor task , to the templates convolved with gaussians .",
    "the resultant calibration curves describe the relation between the input velocity dispersion and the fwhm of the output cross - correlation peak measured by the fxcor task .",
    "we used velocity dispersions from 200  @xmath28 to 450  @xmath28 with an interval of 10  @xmath29 .",
    "the fxcor task was also applied to the normalized rest - frame spectrum of g1 to obtain the width of the g - band absorption line , which we convert to the velocity dispersion using linear interpolation of the calibration curves .",
    "we find that 4 template stars yield similar velocity dispersions for g1 of 338367  @xmath28 . from the average and scatter ( no weight for the 4 independent measurements )",
    ", we determine the velocity dispersion to be @xmath0  @xmath30 . our measurement is consistent with @xmath4 expected from the observed faber - jackson relation , @xmath31  @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the location and the brightness of the confirmed central image allow us to place constraints on the mass of the supermassive bh hosted by g1 .",
    "this is made possible by the fact that central point masses ( de-)magnify or even suppress central images ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed the technique was applied to three - image galaxy - scale lens pmn j1632@xmath320033 to derive an upper limit on @xmath2 in the lensing galaxy @xcite , although the lack of the redshift measurement for the lensing galaxy makes the interpretation of this result somewhat difficult .    before conducting detailed mass modeling , we can estimate the bh mass range from the distance between component e and the center of g1 .",
    "it is given by the mass at which the einstein radius of the central bh becomes comparable to this distance of @xmath33 , corresponding to a bh mass of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we naively expect @xmath35 .    to obtain more quantitative constraints , we fit the quasar images with the following mass model .",
    "we adopt an elliptical version of the ( @xcite ; nfw ) density profile for the dark matter distribution of the lensing cluster . changing the inner slope of the dark matter component",
    "is expected to have little effect on the fifth image , because the center of the dark halo appears to be offset from g1 @xcite .",
    "the central position , ellipticity , position angle , concentration parameter , and total mass of the dark matter distribution are treated as free parameters .",
    "the central galaxy g1 is assumed to be an isothermal ellipsoid with varying core radius .",
    "we constrain the position angle to coincide with that of the light ( @xmath36  deg east of north ) , but with no prior on the ellipticity .",
    "in addition we added a gaussian prior on the velocity dispersion of the isothermal ellipsoid g1 from our measurement , @xmath37  @xmath29 .",
    "the 16 galaxies other than g1 , which we identify as cluster members using their colors , are included as truncated isothermal ellipsoids with an exact scaling relation , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the overall normalization of @xmath40 is left as a free parameter .",
    "we take the ellipticities and position angles for these member galaxies from measurements in the _ hst _ acs images .",
    "finally , we allow for an external shear following @xcite to achieve better fits . for observational constraints",
    ", we adopt the positions and position errors of five quasar images and g1 derived in @xcite .",
    "we also include flux ratios of quasar images as constraints , but with large errors of @xmath41 ( x represents images b  d ) and @xmath42 , in order to allow small flux ratio changes due to time delays and microlensing .",
    "in addition , observed time delays , @xmath43  days @xcite and @xmath44  days @xcite , are included .",
    "( 60mm,60mm)fig3.eps    we find that our model reproduces the data quite well ( see figure [ fig : mbh_crit ] for the critical curves of our best - fit model ) . with no bh ,",
    "the best - fit chi - square is @xmath45 for 3 degree of freedom ( 20 constraints and 17 parameters ) .",
    "thus the central bh is not required to fit the fifth image .",
    "we then place the bh ( modeled by a point mass ) at the center of galaxy g1 , and we re - perform @xmath46 minimizations for each @xmath2 .",
    "we note that the central bh can produce a sixth image near the bh . in what follows",
    "we ignore the sixth image as it is much fainter than the observed fifth image in most of the situations considered here .",
    "we derive the upper limit of @xmath2 from the @xmath46 differences , @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ fig : mbh ] plots @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 , from which we derive constraints on the bh mass of @xmath50 at 1@xmath7 and @xmath51 at 3@xmath7 .",
    "the steep increase of @xmath46 for large @xmath2 means that the mass of the bh is limited to being a small fraction of the stellar mass interior to image e.    ( 70mm,70mm)fig4.eps    as shown in figure [ fig : mbh ] , our constraints on @xmath2 are consistent with the expected local @xmath2-@xmath4 relation @xcite and also those inferred from the extrapolation of a possible redshift evolution measured by @xcite .",
    "although the constraints are model - dependent , in the sense that they are derived assuming a specific parametric mass model , we note that our mass model is quite flexible near the center of g1 because the core radius is a free parameter . indeed , the best - fit core radius is correlated with @xmath2 ; the core radius evolves from @xmath52 for @xmath53 to @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "the rough agreement of this constraint with a simple order - of - magnitude argument also suggests that an upper limit to the bh mass of approximately @xmath56 is generic",
    ". however , improved constraints may be obtained by adding constraints on the sixth image which we ignored , because the sixth image becomes brighter with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the flux of the sixth image is @xmath57 of e in our best - fit models for @xmath58 , whereas the _ hst _ image suggests that it can not be @xmath59 of e.",
    "we have presented the results of two spectroscopic observations at the subaru telescope . with the first observation , we confirmed that the central point source found by @xcite is indeed the central fifth image of the lensed quasar by detecting the c emission line of the quasar .",
    "this represents the first spectroscopic confirmation of the central odd image . in the second spectroscopic observation",
    ", we determined the stellar velocity dispersion of galaxy g1 to be @xmath0  @xmath28 .",
    "we used these results to derive constraints on the @xmath3-@xmath4 relation at the lens redshift @xmath12 , assuming the presence of a bh at the center of the brightest cluster galaxy g1 . with a parametric model which successfully reproduces the model constraints",
    ", we obtained limits of @xmath60 at 1@xmath7 and @xmath61 at 3@xmath7 that are consistent with @xmath2 expected from the extrapolation of the known @xmath62-@xmath4 relation .",
    "it is worth noting that these constraints are derived for an `` inactive '' galaxy with no nuclear activity .",
    "current studies of the redshift evolution of the @xmath62-@xmath4 relation make use of the balmer line widths , and therefore are restricted to bhs in active galaxies .",
    "given possible differences in the @xmath2-@xmath4 between active and inactive local galaxies @xcite , constraints on @xmath2 for distant inactive galaxies from gravitational lensing will be essential to fully understand the origin of the relation .",
