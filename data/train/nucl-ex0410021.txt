    "the great interest to the double beta ( @xmath3 ) decay search is related , in particular , with the recent evidence of neutrino oscillations which strongly suggests that neutrinos have nonzero mass @xcite . while oscillation experiments are sensitive to the neutrinos mass difference , only the measured neutrinoless ( @xmath4 ) double beta decay rate could set the majorana nature of the neutrinos and give the absolute scale of the effective neutrino mass .",
    "@xmath5nd is one of the most promising candidate for @xmath3 decay study due to its large transition energy ( @xmath6 ) . as a result , the calculated value of the phase space integral @xmath7 of the @xmath8 decay of @xmath5nd is the largest one among 35 possible @xmath9 decay candidates @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the product @xmath10 are in the interval @xmath11 yr ( half - lives for the neutrino mass mechanism with @xmath12 ev ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the larger the @xmath6 energy , the simpler , from an experimental point of view , is to overcome background problems .",
    "note that the background from natural radioactivity drops sharply above 2615 kev , which is the energy of the @xmath1 from @xmath13tl decay ( @xmath14th family ) .",
    "in addition , a contribution of cosmogenic activation , which is important problem of the next generation @xmath3 decay experiments @xcite , decreases at higher energies .",
    "there exist no appropriate detector containing neodymium , which could serve as both source and detector simultaneously ( so called `` active '' source experimental method @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that this experimental approach will assure high registration efficiency which is especially important if very expensive enriched @xmath5nd isotope would be used in an experiment .",
    "the purpose of our work was investigation of scintillation properties and preliminary check of radioactive contamination of neodymium doped yttrium - aluminum garnet ( yag : nd ) as a possible detector for double beta decay experiment with @xmath5nd .",
    "the active source method allows also to investigate other rare processes in nd nuclei , such as @xmath2 decay of naturally occurring neodymium isotopes .",
    "main properties of yag : nd ( chemical formula y@xmath15al@xmath16o@xmath17:nd ) are presented in table 1 .",
    "these crystals are well known and their production is well developed due to their wide application in laser technique .",
    "the scintillation properties of cerium doped yttrium - aluminum garnet ( yag : ce ) have been studied in @xcite , properties of yag : yb have been reported in @xcite , whereas yag : nd , to our knowledge , was never studied as a scintillator .",

    "the mass of the crystal is 7.16 g. photoelectron yield was estimated with the philips xp2412 bialkali photomultiplier ( pmt ) as 8% of nai(tl ) .",
    "the energy resolution fwhm=13.6% was measured for 662 kev @xmath1 line of @xmath23cs with the yag : nd crystal wrapped by ptfe reflector tape and optically coupled to the pmt xp2412 .",
    "a substantial improvement of the light output ( @xmath2222% ) and energy resolution was achieved by placing the crystal in liquid ( silicone oil with index of refraction @xmath221.5 ) .",
    "the crystal was fixed in center of the teflon container @xmath24 mm and viewed by two pmts xp2412 .",
    "1 demonstrates the energy spectra of @xmath23cs and @xmath25bi obtained in such a way with the yag : nd crystal .",
    "the energy resolution of 9.3% was obtained with the yag : nd crystal scintillator for 662 kev @xmath1 line of @xmath23cs .",
    "we estimate the energy resolution of the yag : nd scintillation detector at the energy @xmath6 of @xmath5nd using the results of measurements with @xmath23cs and @xmath25bi @xmath1 sources .",
    "these data were fitted by function fwhm(kev)@xmath26 with values @xmath27 kev and @xmath28 kev , where energy of @xmath1 quanta @xmath29 is in kev .",
    "the energy resolution fwhm@xmath224% could be achieved at the @xmath6 energy of @xmath5nd .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio was measured with the help of the collimated @xmath2 particles of a @xmath30am source .",
    "as it was checked by surface - barrier detector , the energy of @xmath2 particles was reduced to about 5.25 mev by @xmath31 mm of air , due to passing through the collimator .",
    "2 shows the energy spectrum of the @xmath2 particles measured by the yag : nd scintillator .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio is 0.33 .",
    "the yag : nd crystal was irradiated in three perpendicular directions with aim to check a possible dependence of the @xmath32 signal on direction of irradiation .",
    "while earlier such a dependence has been found for cdwo@xmath33 @xcite and znwo@xmath33 @xcite scintillators , we did not observe it for yag : nd crystal .",
    "the shapes of scintillation light pulses in yag : nd crystals were studied for @xmath34 mev @xmath2 particles and @xmath35 mev @xmath1 quanta with the help of a 12 bit 20 mhz transient digitizer as described in @xcite .",
    "the pulse shape can be fitted by sum of exponential functions :    @xmath36 ,    where @xmath37 are intensities ( in % ) , and @xmath38 are decay constants for different light emission components , @xmath39 is integration constant of electronics ( @xmath220.2  @xmath20s ) .",
    "the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 obtained by fitting the average of @xmath223 thousand individual @xmath2 and @xmath1 pulses in the time interval @xmath40 @xmath20s ( see fig .",
    "3 ) are presented in table 2 .",
    "observed difference in light pulse shapes allows to discriminate @xmath41(@xmath42 ) events from @xmath2 particles .",
    "we applied for this purpose the optimal filter method proposed in @xcite and developed in @xcite . to obtain the numerical characteristic of yag : nd signal , so called shape indicator ( @xmath43 ) , the following formula was applied for each pulse :    @xmath44 ,    where the sum is over time channels @xmath45 starting from the origin of pulse and up to 50 @xmath46s , @xmath47 is the digitized amplitude ( at the time @xmath48 ) of a given signal .",
    "the weight function @xmath49 is defined as : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the reference pulse shapes for @xmath2 particles and @xmath1 quanta .",
    "reasonable discrimination between @xmath2 particles and @xmath1 rays was achieved using this approach as one can see in fig .",

    ". it should be interesting to check yag : nd crystal as the cryogenic detector to search for alpha decay of @xmath63nd and to measure more accurately the @xmath64nd half - life .",
    "it should be also mentioned a possibility to search for spin - dependent inelastic scattering of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) with excitation of low energy nuclear levels of @xmath63nd ( the lowest one : @xmath65 67 kev , e2 transition , and the second level : @xmath66 72 kev , m1 transition ) due to nonzero spin of this nucleus ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "identification of such `` mixed '' ( nuclear recoil plus @xmath1 quanta ) events could be possible due to the simultaneous registration of heat and light signals ( such a techniques have been used in @xcite ) . a heat / light ratio for such events would differ from `` pure '' nuclear recoils or @xmath1(electron ) events .",
