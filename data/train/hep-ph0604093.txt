    "the strange matter , which is a quark matter composed of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , has been one of the interesting subjects in the quark and hadron physics @xcite .",
    "this subject is also related with other fields , such as the topics of compact stars , the early universe , heavy ion collision phenomena and so on .",
    "however , the physics of the strange matter has been a difficult problem of qcd .",
    "effective models of qcd were used from the early stage . the mit bag model has been often used to show the stability of the strange matter @xcite . in this model , it is assumed that the strange matter is approximated as almost free quark gas with current quark masses .",
    "there , it was shown that the strange matter can be stable as compared with the @xmath3 quark matter .",
    "this is because the @xmath2 quark current mass is small as compared with the fermi energy of the @xmath3 quark .",
    "moreover , it was argued that the strange matter could be more stable than nuclear matter .",
    "quark droplets with finite volume with strangeness , which we call strangelets , could be also more stable than atomic nuclei .",
    "if the strangelets are stable particles , they should be observed as almost neutral heavy particles in experiments .",
    "indeed , several candidates of exotic particles have been observed in the cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "there are also experiments to search for such exotic particles in heavy ion collision experiments @xcite .    in the arguments in @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that chiral symmetry is restored in the strange matter . however , when we allow chiral symmetry breaking , the stability of the strange matter is not necessarily concluded .",
    "this is because @xmath2 quarks acquire a large dynamical mass by chiral symmetry breaking . in @xcite , the stability of the bulk strange matter",
    "was discussed by considering dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , in which the quark dynamical mass depended on the baryon number density . in these discussions , however , it was shown that the strange matter could not be absolutely stable .",
    "the main reason of the instability of the strange matter is that the dynamical mass of the @xmath2 quarks is larger than the @xmath3 quark fermi energy .",
    "it was pointed out that the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking is related with the formation of quark droplets @xcite .",
    "the stability of strangelets were discussed in a constituent quark model with one - gluon - exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "there , it was assumed that the quarks have constant constituent mass .",
    "thus , chiral symmetry breaking is an important ingredient to discuss the stability of the strange matter .",
    "it was also pointed out that chiral symmetry breaking plays an important role , not only in the bulk quark matter , but also in strangelets of finite volume @xcite . in @xcite , it was argued that the chiral symmetry breaking in the strangelets depended on the size of the strangelet by using the njl model supplemented by the quark confinement . in this argument",
    ", it was assumed that the quarks interacting by the njl interaction are confined in a mit bag as a strangelet .",
    "this model is called the _",
    "njl+mit bag _ model . in our previous work @xcite , instead of solving the boundary condition of the mit bag exactly , the multiple reflection expansion ( mre ) @xcite was used as an approximate method with an expectation that the strangelets have large baryon number . there",
    ", the surface effects were included by calculating the density of states of quarks modified by the boundary condition .",
    "it was shown that the chiral symmetry of the @xmath2 quark sector in the strangelet is restored by the surface effect up to the baryon number of thousands , and strangelets could be more stable than the @xmath3 quark droplets .",
    "however , it was not possible to compare the stability of the strangelets with baryons ( nucleons , hyperons and so on ) , since the mass of a single baryon was not calculated due to the limitation of the mre approximation .    in this paper , we investigate the njl+ mit bag model as one of the effective models of the baryon and the quark droplet .",
    "we consider directly the discrete quark energy levels by solving the boundary condition , which implements the quark confinement .",
    "the advantage of the present method is that we can construct a solution for all baryon number @xmath4 including the nucleon and hyperon .",
    "this is contrasted with the previous discussion by the mre which can be applied to the case of relatively large @xmath4 @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we discuss the absolute stability of the strangelets as compared with baryons .",
    "in addition , we check the validity of the approximation of the mre .",

    "we may need to consider the meson clouds around the bag also .",
    "in fact , from the view of chiral symmetry , the @xmath208 and @xmath209 mesons should be introduced at the bag surface in order to recover chiral symmetry broken at the bag surface . in the present work , we neglected them .",
