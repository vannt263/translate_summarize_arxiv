    "as one of the most subtle phenomena in many - body systems , quantum entanglement has now been an important physical resource widely used in quantum communication and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore it is fundamental to characterize the entanglement nature in quantum systems , especially at a quantitative level .",
    "till now , although bipartite entanglement is well understood in many aspects , the entanglement in multipartite systems is far from clear and thus deserve further exploration .",
    "entanglement dynamical behavior is an important property in practical quantum information processing .",
    "this is because entanglement is fragile and always decays due to unwanted interactions between the system and its environment . a theoretical study of two - atom spontaneous emission shows that entanglement does not always decay in an asymptotic way and it can be corrupted in a finite time @xcite , which is referred to as entanglement sudden death ( esd ) .",
    "some earlier studies also pointed out this fact that even a very weakly dissipative environment can disentangle the quantum system in a finite time @xcite .",
    "the esd phenomenon has recently received a lot of attentions @xcite ( see also a review paper @xcite and references therein ) , and , experimentally , it has been detected in photon @xcite and atom systems @xcite .",
    "a deep understanding on the esd phenomenon concerns the problem where the lost entanglement goes . to answer the question ,",
    "it is proper to enlarge the system to include its environment .",
    "recently , lpez _ et al _ analyzed the entanglement evolution in a composite system consisting of entangled cavity photons with individual reservoirs @xcite , and show that the entanglement sudden birth ( esb ) of reservoir - reservoir subsystem must happen whenever the esd of cavity - cavity subsystem occurs .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , bai _ et al _ presented a entanglement monogamy relation in multipartite systems and analyzed quantitatively the bipartite entanglement transfer in the multipartite cavity - reservoir system .",
    "however , in the above analysis , the multipartite entanglement in the composite cavity - reservoir system is not well characterized ,",
    "although the residual entanglement @xcite can indicate its existence . moreover , the authors only consider the symmetric initial state like @xmath0 .",
    "when the initial state is asymmetric , the entanglement evolution can be very different .",
    "for example , a @xmath1 operation acting on the symmetric state can change the evolution of the entangled cavity photons from the esd route to the asymptotic decay route , although the two kinds of initial states have the equal entanglement .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to consider the entanglement dynamical behavior for the asymmetric case and , particularly , find a good entanglement measure to characterize the genuine multipartite entanglement evolution .    in this paper , for the asymmetric initial state modulated by an arbitrary local unitary ( lu ) operation , we analyze its entanglement evolution in the multipartite cavity - reservoir system . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the effective output state under the lu operation , in which there is only one parameter affecting the entanglement dynamics . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the bipartite entanglement transfer in the composite system , and point out the cavity photon entanglement is still correlated with the reservoir entanglement although the local operation can delay the esd time and advance the esb time . in sec .",
    "iv , the multipartite entanglement evolution is studied via a new defined four - qubit entanglement measure and two three - qubit entanglement measures . in sec .",
    "v , within a unified framework , we investigate the relation between bipartite entanglement transfer and multipartite entanglement transition in the composite system .",
    "finally , we discuss the entanglement evolution with an arbitrary initial state and give a brief conclusion in sec .",
    "before the derivation of the effective output state under the lu operation , we first recall the multipartite cavity - reservoir system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lpez _ et al _ considered two entangled cavity photons being affected by the dissipation of two individual @xmath2-mode reservoirs where the interaction of a single cavity - reservoir system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 the authors analyzed the entanglement evolution with the symmetric initial state @xmath4 in which the reservoirs are in the vacuum state and the quantum state of cavity photons is invariant under the permutation of the qubits @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "they show that , along the time evolution , the esd of two photons can happen when the initial state amplitudes satisfy the condition @xmath7 , and this procedure is _ necessarily _ related to the esb of two reservoirs .",
    "now , we consider the asymmetric initial state modulated by an arbitrary single - qubit lu operation . without loss of generality , we assume that the operation acts on the first cavity , and then the initial state can be written as @xmath8 for an arbitrary single qubit lu operation",
    ", one can decompose it as @xcite @xmath9 where the @xmath10 is a global phase shift and @xmath11 is the rotation along the @xmath12 axis with the @xmath13 being the pauli matrix . in this case , the output state under the time evolution is @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the @xmath17 means the states on two sides are equivalent up to some lu operations ( for a detail derivation , see the appendix ) .",
    "after considering the effect of the evolution @xmath18 on the entanglement dynamics , we find that it is equivalent to that of the evolution @xmath19 ( in the appendix , we give the proof ) . the case for the evolution @xmath20 is similar .",
    "( 5 ) can be rewritten as @xmath21,\\ ] ] which means that , under an arbitrary lu operation @xmath22 , the entanglement evolution is only sensitive to the rotation @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the effective initial state for the entanglement evolution is @xmath24 in which the new basic vectors are @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for the output state , we use the approximation @xcite @xmath27 where the amplitudes are @xmath28 and @xmath29^{1/2}$ ] in the limit of @xmath30 for a reservoir with a flat spectrum .",

    "according to the effective output state @xmath35 in eq . ( 9 ) , we can derive the density matrices of different subsystems and analyze their entanglement dynamical behaviors .",
    "we first consider the subsystem of two cavity photons , for which its density matrix is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and the four non - normalized pure state components are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "it is still an unsolved problem whether or not the esd of cavity photons and the esb of the reservoirs are correlated in the asymmetric case . with the conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59",

    ", we can derive that the esd of two photons occurs when @xmath63 , as is the case for the esb of two reservoirs .",
    "this means that the correlation between the esd and the esb _ still _ holds for the asymmetric initial states , i.e. , the esb of the reservoirs must happen when the esd of cavity photons occurs .    as an example",

    "<S> we analyze the entanglement evolution of two cavity photons being affected by the dissipation of two individual reservoirs . under an arbitrary local unitary operation on the initial state </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that there is only one parameter which changes the entanglement dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for the bipartite subsystems , we show that the entanglement of the cavity photons is correlated with that of the reservoirs , although the local operation can delay the time at which the photon entanglement disappears and advance the time at which the reservoir entanglement appears . furthermore , via a new defined four - qubit entanglement measure and two three - qubit entanglement measures , we study the multipartite entanglement evolution in the composite system , which allows us to analyze quantitatively both bipartite and multipartite entanglement within a unified framework . in addition , we also discuss the entanglement evolution with an arbitrary initial state . </S>"
