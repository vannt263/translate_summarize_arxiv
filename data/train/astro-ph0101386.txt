    "until recently , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) provided the only precision estimates of the baryon density of the universe .",
    "based on recent deuterium observations @xcite , bbn identifies a value for the baryon density which has been variously estimated ( depending on the choice for the primordial deuterium abundance ) as @xmath5 @xcite , and @xmath6 @xcite , or incorporating the most recent data @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the baryon density expressed as a fraction of the critical density , @xmath9 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / sec / mpc , and the ranges quoted are intended to be at the 95% confidence level .    in the past year , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations have become a competitive means for estimating the baryon density .",
    "these data have been used both alone and in combination with other observations ( such as type ia supernovae and large - scale structure ) to set limits on @xmath10 .",
    "the preliminary cmb data from boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite suggested a higher baryon density ( @xmath11 ) than that predicted from bbn , due to the unexpectedly low second acoustic peak in these cmb observations ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy has vanished in the wake of more recent data from boomerang @xcite , maxima @xcite and dasi @xcite .",
    "this original discrepancy between the bbn and cmb predictions for @xmath10 led to the suggestion that perhaps new physics must be invoked to reconcile the bbn and cmb predictions for @xmath10 .",
    "the problems for bbn at the high baryon density suggested by the refs .",
    "@xcite - @xcite are that the bbn - predicted abundance of deuterium is too low while those of helium-4 and lithium-7 are too high when compared to the observationally inferred primordial abundances .",
    "if , however , the universal expansion rate were increased during the bbn epoch by , for example , the contribution to the total energy density of  new \" neutrinos and/or other relativistic particles , the bbn - predicted abundance of deuterium would increase ( less time for d - destruction ) , while that of lithium would decrease ( less time for production of @xmath12be ) .",
    "this increase in the expansion rate results in a higher helium abundance , but the bbn - predicted helium abundance can be reduced by a non - zero chemical potential for the electron neutrinos .",
    "an excess of @xmath13 over @xmath14 can drive the neutron - proton ratio down , leading to reduced production of helium-4 .",
    "thus , reconciling bbn with a high baryon density would require two kinds of `` new physics '' : the expansion rate should be faster than the standard value and @xmath13 should be `` degenerate '' .",
    "although these two effects may be unrelated , neutrino degeneracy can provide an economic mechanism for both , since the energy density contributed by degenerate neutrinos exceeds that from non - degenerate neutrinos , leading to an enhanced expansion rate during the epoch of bbn . as kang & steigman @xcite and olive et al .",
    "@xcite have shown , the observed primordial abundances of the light nuclides can be reconciled with very large baryon densities provided sufficient neutrino degeneracy is permitted .    although the most recent cmb observations suggest that no new physics need be invoked to reconcile the cmb and bbn observations , these measurements also provide another tool , independent of bbn , to constrain such new physics . from the contribution of ref . @xcite and the combined cmb and bbn analyses of ref .",
    "@xcite -@xcite , it is already clear that the constraints on  new physics \" are strongly dependent on the priors assumed in the analysis for the other , non - bbn related cosmological parameters . here",
    "we explore this issue further .",
    "in particular , we consider the concordance between the cmb and bbn predictions for @xmath10 in models with neutrino degeneracy using four different representative sets of priors . in the next section",
    "we discuss our calculation and give results for our four models .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in secs .  3 and  4 .",
    "our first step is the calculation of element abundances in bbn for models with degenerate neutrinos .",
    "this is a well - understood calculation with a long history , and the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the details .",
    "the degeneracy of any of the three neutrinos increases the total relativistic energy density , leading to an increase in the overall expansion rate . during `` radiation dominated '' epochs the expansion rate ( hubble parameter ) is proportional to the square root of the total energy density in extremely relativistic ( er ) particles so the speedup factor , @xmath15 , is @xmath16    in addition , the _ electron _ neutrino separately affects the rates of the weak reactions which interconvert protons and neutrons , and so it is convenient to parameterize the neutrino degeneracy in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ratio of the electron neutrino chemical potential @xmath20 to the neutrino temperature @xmath21 , and @xmath18 ( @xmath22 ) is the additional energy density contributed by all the degenerate neutrinos _ as well as any other energy density not accounted for in the standard model of particle physics _ ( e.g. , additional relativistic particles ) expressed in terms of the equivalent number of extra , non - degenerate , two - component neutrinos : @xmath23 the contribution to @xmath2from one species of degenerate neutrinos is @xcite , @xmath24,\\ ] ] we emphasize that our results are independent of whether @xmath2 ( or , equivalently , the corresponding value of @xmath15 ) arises from neutrino degeneracy , from `` new '' ( er ) particles , or from some other source .",
    "note that a non - zero value of @xmath17 implies a non - zero contribution to @xmath18 from the electron neutrinos alone ; we have included this contribution in our calculations .",
    "however , for the range of @xmath17 which proves to be of interest for bbn consistency ( @xmath25 ) , the degenerate electron neutrinos contribute only a small fraction of an additional neutrino species to the energy density ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the question we address is : for a given value of the baryon - photon ratio @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , are there values for @xmath17 and for @xmath18 which result in agreement between the bbn predictions and the known limits on the primordial element abundances ? through the hard work of many observers , aided by better detectors and bigger telescopes , the statistical uncertainties in the observationally inferred primordial abundances have been reduced significantly in recent years .",
    "in contrast , the systematic errors are still quite large ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for this reason we adopt generous ranges for the primordial abundances of @xmath29he , d , and @xmath12li .",
    "furthermore , even for fixed values of @xmath27 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , there are uncertainties in the bbn - predicted abundances due to uncertainties in the nuclear and/or weak reaction rates .",
    "we have chosen the ranges for the primordial abundances large enough to encompass these uncertainties as well .",
    "for the primordial helium-4 mass fraction , we take the limits to be @xmath30 for deuterium and lithium-7 , expressed as number ratios to hydrogen , we take the limits @xmath31 and @xmath32    our allowed parameter range is thus a three - dimensional volume in the space of @xmath27 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "however , since we wish to compare to the predictions of the cmb , which are sensitive to @xmath27 and @xmath18 , but independent of @xmath17 , we project our allowed bbn region onto the @xmath33 plane .",
    "our bbn results are shown in the four panels of figure 1 where , for four choices of @xmath17 we show the iso - abundance contours for y@xmath34 , d / h and li / h in the @xmath33 plane .",
    "the shaded areas highlight the acceptable regions in our parameter space . as @xmath17 increases",
    ", the allowed region moves to higher values of @xmath27 and @xmath18 , tracing out a bbn - consistent band in the @xmath33 plane .",
    "this band is shown by the dashed lines in figures 2 & 5 .",
    "the trends are easy to understand ( see @xcite & @xcite )",
    ". as the baryon density increases the universal expansion rate ( as measured by @xmath18 ) must increase to keep the deuterium and lithium unchanged , while the @xmath13 degeneracy ( @xmath35 ) must increase to maintain the helium abundance at its sbbn value .",
    "= 4.05truein",
    "we then use cmbfast @xcite to calculate the cmb fluctuation spectrum as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath18 and compare with the boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite and dasi @xcite observations .",
    "however , the cmb anisotropy spectrum is sensitive to a large number of other parameters which have no effect on bbn , including the fraction of the critical density in non - relativistic matter @xmath36 ( where @xmath36 includes both baryonic and non - baryonic matter ) , the fraction of the critical density contributed by the cosmological constant @xmath37 ( or an equivalent vacuum energy density ) , the total @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ; @xmath40 corresponds to a `` flat '' universe ) , the hubble parameter @xmath9 , and the slope of the primordial power spectrum @xmath41 (  tilt \" ) .",
    "since we are interested in the way in which restricting these parameters affects the agreement between the cmb and bbn , we consider four representative sets of prior assumptions :    0.4 cm    case a :  @xmath40 ,  @xmath42 ,  @xmath43 , +  @xmath44 ,    case b :  @xmath40 ,  @xmath42 ,  @xmath43 , +  @xmath45 ,    case c :  @xmath40 ,  @xmath46 ,  @xmath47 , +  @xmath45 ,    case d :  @xmath48 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , + @xmath45 .    0.4 cm    in models a  c , the inflation - inspired assumption that the universe is flat is adopted and a cosmological constant is assumed to give @xmath40 ; in contrast , in model d the value of @xmath37 is set to zero and the universe is allowed to be open or flat @xcite .",
    "tensor modes are ignored in all of these cases .",
    "case a differs from case b only in the restriction of tilt to @xmath50 .",
    "case c differs from case b in the adoption of a slightly smaller range for the hubble parameter and , of more significance , a more restricted range for the non - relativistic matter density , both of which are consistent with complementary observational data .",
    "case c is closest to what is often referred to as the  concordance @xmath51cdm model \" while case d is closest to the  scdm model \" which is inconsistent with the sn ia data @xcite .",
    "= 4.15truein    for each of these sets of priors , we determine the best fit cmb model for a given pair of values of @xmath18 and @xmath27 and assign a confidence limit based on the @xmath52 value calculated with radpack @xcite . in the four panels of figure 2 we display the ( two - parameter ) 68% and 95% contours in the @xmath27 ",
    "@xmath53 plane for the four choices of priors discussed above .",
    "the different shapes of the confidence interval contours highlight the sensitivity of the `` new physics '' ( @xmath53 ) to the choices of priors for the other cosmological parameters .",
    "the effect on the post - bbn universe of a non - zero @xmath2is to enhance the relativistic energy density , delaying the epoch of equal matter and radiation densities .",
    "this can be offset by increasing @xmath36 , effectively restoring the original , @xmath2= 0 , ratio of matter and radiation densities .",
    "this effect produces the large difference between cases a & b and case c. this may be seen in figure 3 where the sensitivity of the constraints on @xmath18 to the priors adopted in the cmb fits is explored by comparing the @xmath54 distributions for our four cases a ",
    "d. in cases a & b , very large values for @xmath2are allowed , corresponding to large values of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , cases a & b do not provide very effective upper limits on @xmath2when only the cmb data is taken into account ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for case c , in contrast ,",
    "large values of @xmath36 are not permitted .",
    "as seen in figure 3 this results in a stronger upper bound on @xmath2 : at the 68% confidence level , @xmath2@xmath55 .",
    "case d yields a very different set of constraints . in this model ,",
    "values of @xmath56 are compensated with curvature , rather than with a cosmological constant .",
    "but the position of the first acoustic peak strongly constrains the curvature to be nearly zero , forcing @xmath38 to be nearly unity .",
    "hence , in these models @xmath57 , with almost no freedom to vary , and a change in @xmath2cannot be cancelled by changing @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the allowed range for @xmath2is very small .",
    "= 4.0truein    despite the differences , there are some striking similarities in the parameter ranges identified in figure 2 . with the exception of case d , the preferred ranges of baryon densities are very similar",
    "( see figure 4 ) . at 68% confidence @xmath58 ( at 95% confidence , @xmath59 ) , for cases a ",
    "c ; for case d , @xmath60 is shifted downwards by @xmath61 .",
    "for all cases , a baryon density @xmath62 is a robust prediction of the cmb observations .",
    "in contrast , constraints on the magnitude of the `` new physics '' ( @xmath18 ) do depend sensitively on the choice of priors . as noted earlier , for the @xmath51cdm models ( cases a ",
    "c ) , case c produces a stronger upper bound on @xmath18 , than do cases a or b. figure 3 also illustrates a point which is only marginally apparent from figure 2 : case a prefers a non - zero value of @xmath2 slightly more than do cases b and c ( albeit not at a statistically significant level ) .",
    "since case a fixes @xmath44 , this suggests that a nonzero @xmath2can mimic , to some extent the effect of  tilt \" .",
    "this point is further emphasized when the bbn data are included in figure 2 : for @xmath2= 0 , the overlap between the allowed values for @xmath27 for cmb and bbn is smaller for case a ( ruled out at the 68% confidence level ) , than for cases b and c. however , given the marginal level of exclusion ( 68% ) , this can not be used to argue for  new physics \" .",
    "in contrast , as already noted , case d is anomalous ; in the absence of new physics it disagrees with the cmb data at the 93% confidence level .",
    "= 4.0truein    it is clear from figure 3 that , with the exception of the statistically disfavored case d , the cmb provides only very weak constraints on @xmath63 .",
    "the notable constrast between cases b and c , with very similar priors , demonstrates the significant sensitivity of @xmath2to the choice of priors . because of this sensitivity , it is difficult to compare our results directly with those of hannestad @xcite , lesgourgues & liddle @xcite , and of hansen et al .",
    "we are in agreement with hannestad @xcite in that although @xmath2@xmath64 appears to be favored by the cmb data , the standard model value of @xmath2= 0 is entirely compatible with the present data .",
    "in figure 5 we choose the priors corresponding to case c (  @xmath51cdm \" ) to illustrate the confrontation between the bbn constraints and those from the cmb . as already alluded to above , the points in the @xmath27  @xmath2 plane ( fig .  2 ) are projections from a multi - dimensional parameter space and the relevant values of those additional parameters may not always be consistent with other , independent observational data . as an illustration , in figure 5",
    "we also show three isochrones , for 11 , 12 , and 13 gyr .",
    "the trend in the isochrones is easy to understand : as @xmath2increases , so too do the corresponding values of the matter density ( @xmath65 ) and the hubble parameter ( h@xmath66 ) which minimize @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath67 , @xmath68 decreases .",
    "all of these lead to younger ages for larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "note that if a constraint is imposed that the universe today is at least 11 gyr old @xcite , then the bbn and cmb overlap is considerably restricted ( to the shaded region in figure 5 ) .",
    "even with this constraint it is clear that there is room for modest `` new physics '' ( @xmath2@xmath3 ; @xmath69 ) , for which there is a limited range of baryon density ( @xmath70 0.026 ) which is concordant with both the bbn and cmb constraints .",
    "if instead we were to impose a stricter , but still reasonable , constraint on the age , say that the universe be older than 13 gyr , the acceptable range of baryon density and `` new physics '' would be considerably narrowed .",
    "bbn alone does not provide any significant constraint on the magnitude of the  new physics \" arising from neutrino degeneracy ; larger values of @xmath35 and @xmath2simply correspond to larger values of @xmath27 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown that cmb observations can constrain @xmath2(and , correspondingly , @xmath35 ) but this constraint is sensitive to the priors chosen when fitting the cmb data .",
    "however , we have noted that if an additional cosmological constraint ( on the age of the universe ) is imposed , this ambiguity can be eliminated and a restricted range of parameters is identified : @xmath71 , @xmath2@xmath3 , and @xmath72 .",
    "if the extra relativistic energy density ( @xmath18 ) is contributed by degenerate @xmath73 , and/or @xmath74 , then ( see eq .",
    "3 ) @xmath75 ( for @xmath76 or , vice - versa ) or , @xmath77 .",
