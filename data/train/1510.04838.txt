    "analytical treatments of transport processes typically impose that the motion of a particle is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the velocity field .",
    "the precise description of the trajectories of ( [ intro ] ) for any initial condition is usually a very difficult task . by this reason ,",
    "many researchers have focused their attention on a less ambitious problem -the detection of barriers to transport , that is , trajectories acting as skeleton of patterns , ( the obstruction to transport takes place by uniqueness of solution ) , see @xcite .    to detect barriers to transport in general flows , mancho , wiggins , and their co - workers introduced in several papers @xcite the method of lagrangian descriptors .",
    "this methodology has been already applied in many different contexts without assumptions on ( [ intro ] ) .",
    "for instance , mendoza and mancho in @xcite described the skeleton of the flow for the kuroshio current ; de la camara _ et al _ in @xcite provided barriers to transport in the antarctic polar vortex ; or rempel _ et al _ in @xcite studied the saturation of a nonlinear dynamo .",
    "very recently , craven and hernandez used the method of lagrangian descriptors in the context of thermalized chemical reactions @xcite . in that letter",
    "they claim :  this approach is applicable to any activated system subject to arbitrary driving and thermal fluctuations \" .",
    "the reader can consult , for instance , @xcite-@xcite for additional applications .",
    "the lack of mathematical foundations of the method of lagrangian descriptors makes this approach problematic in precise situations . in @xcite ,",
    "the author presented several counter - examples and a mathematical analysis to explain the no connection with invariant manifolds in dynamical systems .",
    "moreover , i discussed phenomena of  ghost dynamics \" , i.e. the detection of invariant manifolds at irrelevant points .",
    "most of real geophysical applications deal with incompressible velocity fields .",
    "however the counter - examples for this class of systems given in @xcite are very complex and have an aperiodic dependence on time .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to improve our theoretical understanding on the performance of the method of lagrangian descriptors .",
    "we are interested when the dynamical behaviour of the flow is governed by a global saddle point . roughly speaking",
    ", our results basically express three limitations :    * the attraction and repulsion rates must be similar in the whole space . * any local condition in ( [ intro ] ) can be irrelevant in the performance of the method .",
    "specifically , we find two autonomous incompressible flows coinciding in @xmath3 where the responses of lagrangian descriptors in each system are completely different in that region . *",
    "the method of the lagrangian descriptors is very sensible to any small perturbation of ( [ intro ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the techniques presented here offer the possibility to investigate general classes of flows .",
    "for instance , one can infer that the method of lagrangian descriptors is not useful in most linear systems .",
    "the outline of this note is as follows . in the next section",
    "we recall the method of lagrangian descriptors for the reader s convenience . in section 3",
    ", we provide families of counter - examples in incompressible flows .",
    "finally , we conclude the manuscript with a discussion .",
    "in this section we recall some definitions and the precise statement of the method of lagrangian descriptors .    consider    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is of class @xmath6 .",
    "we define @xmath7 as the euclidean arc length of the solution starting at @xmath8 along the interval @xmath9 $ ] , namely @xmath10 in the previous expression , @xmath11 is the solution of ( [ sistemalineal ] ) satisfying that @xmath12 .",
    "we denote the contour line of @xmath0 passing through @xmath13 at time @xmath14 as @xmath15    the method of lagrangian descriptors says that the invariant manifolds of saddle - points in ( [ sistemalineal ] ) are given by  singular points \" ( i.e.  non - smooth points \" ) of the contour lines of @xmath0 , see @xcite .",
    "to illustrate this idea , we discuss the example theoretically studied by mancho , wiggins and their co - workers in @xcite , specifically @xmath16    the contour - lines of @xmath0 associated with ( [ sl1 ] ) converge to curves with singular features at the axes , see figure 1 .     in @xmath17 associated with system ( [ sl1 ] ) for @xmath18 and @xmath19.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    note that the origin is a global saddle point of ( [ sl1 ] ) where the @xmath20-axis ( resp . the @xmath21-axis )",
    "is its unstable ( resp .",
    "stable ) manifold .",
    "a key dynamical property of ( [ sl1 ] ) is that the repulsion and attraction rates are exactly the same in the whole phase space .",
    "when such a property is violated -even in the simplest way- the method of lagrangian descriptors can fail .",
    "in this section we provide several counter - examples to the method of lagrangian descriptors in 2d and 3d incompressible flows .",
    "consider @xmath22 a function of class @xmath23 with @xmath24 and satisfying the following conditions :    c1 : :    @xmath25 if @xmath26 and    @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",

    "an example of such a function is , for instance ,    @xmath35    [ tmanin ] assume that @xmath22 satisfies * c1-c4*. then the method of lagrangian descriptors fails in the hamiltonian system @xmath36    before giving the proof of this result , we observe that ( [ sl ] ) has a global saddle at the origin where the @xmath20-axis ( resp @xmath21-axis ) is the un - stable ( resp .",
    "stable ) manifold .",
    "systems ( [ sl ] ) and ( [ sl1 ] ) coincide in @xmath37 , ( when @xmath38 ) .",
    "however the response of the method of lagrangian descriptors in that region is completely different in both systems . in ( [ sl ] ) , on the stable manifold , the attraction has an exponential rate of @xmath39 but on the unstable manifold , the repulsion rate is sub - linear .    to prove theorem [ tmanin ] , we need the following lemma .",
    "[ l2 ] fix a compact set @xmath40\\times ( 0,\\infty)$ ] .",
    "then @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .    *",
    "first of all , we note that the solution of ( [ sl ] ) with initial condition @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the solution of @xmath46 with initial condition @xmath47 . by simple computations and using * c2,c3 * , @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51    for all @xmath43 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a bound of @xmath29 . therefore ,    @xmath54 because of @xmath55@xmath56 the second limit is a simple application of the lhpital rule .    by * c1 * and * c4 * , @xmath57 for all @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath60 for all @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "the contour lines of @xmath0 tend to  horizontal lines \" in a neighbourhood of the stable manifold.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the techniques of the previous theorem allow us to give simple families of counter - examples in linear systems .",
    "[ t2 ] consider @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "that is , the contour surfaces of @xmath0 in a neighbourhood of the stable manifolds tend to smooth surfaces.in figure 3 we illustrate theorem [ t2 ] in @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 . note that , in this case , ( [ s25 ] ) is an incompressible flow .     in @xmath92",

    "the counter - examples that we found have simple dynamics .",
    "hence , more pathologies are expected in systems with more complex dynamics .",
    "numerous lagrangian diagnostic tools such as finite time lyapunov exponents or finite size lyapunov exponents have been applied to infer transport barriers in real applications , see @xcite . to the best of my knowledge , a solid mathematical framework based on rigorous theorems , similar to lagrangian coherent structures results in @xcite , is completely missing for the method of lagrangian descriptors .",
    "the results of the present paper stress the necessity of such a framework in the applications discussed in @xcite-@xcite .    finally , we point out that the poincar map at time 1 of the systems discussed above are counter - examples to the method of lagrangian descriptors in discrete systems developed by lopesino _ et al _ in @xcite . in that paper , they introduced variations of the @xmath0 function as possible diagnostic tools , specifically    @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "palpably , one can see that the role of @xmath101 in studying systems ( [ e12 ] ) ( when @xmath102 ) or ( [ sl ] ) is to reduce the velocity of attraction to horizontal lines of the contour lines of @xmath103 .",
