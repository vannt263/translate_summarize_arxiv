    "the penrose inequality was originally proposed by penrose as a test of the cosmic censorship conjecture , or more generally a test of the standard picture of gravitational collapse  @xcite .",
    "consider a strongly asymptotically flat cauchy surface in a spacetime satisfying the dominant energy condition , with adm mass @xmath30 , and containing an event horizon of area @xmath31 , which undergoes gravitational collapse and settles to a kerr - newman black hole . since the adm mass @xmath2 of the final state is no greater than @xmath30 , and since the end state area radius @xmath9 is no less than @xmath32 by hawking s area theorem  @xcite , and since for the final state @xmath33 in order to avoid naked singularities , it must have been the case that @xmath34 also at the beginning of the evolution .",
    "the event horizon is indiscernible in the original slice without knowing the full evolution .",
    "however , one may replace the event horizon by the outermost minimal area enclosure of the apparent horizon , the boundary of the region admitting trapped surfaces , and reach the same conclusion .",
    "a counterexample to the penrose inequality would therefore have suggested cauchy data which leads under the einstein evolution to naked singularities , while a proof of the inequality could be viewed as evidence in support of cosmic censorship .",
    "it is usually assumed that the end state of gravitational collapse is a single kerr - newman black hole . however , a more appropriate assumption for the end state is a finite number of mutually distant kerr - newman black holes moving apart with asymptotically constant velocity .",
    "this should be the result , if for instance , two distant black holes were initially moving away from each other sufficiently fast .",
    "we will now describe the heuristic penrose argument for the charged penrose inequality   in this setting .",
    "it appears that this has not been previously considered in the literature .",
    "let @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 denote the adm masses , horizon areas , total charges , and angular momenta of the end state black holes .",
    "then the total ( adm ) mass , horizon area radius , and charge of the end state is @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the area radius of the kerr - newman black hole  @xcite is given by @xmath42 it follows that @xmath43 let @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 denote the adm mass , horizon area radius , and total charge of an initial state . under the assumption that no charged matter is present ,",
    "the total charge is conserved @xmath47 . moreover , by the hawking area theorem @xmath48 , and since gravitational waves may only carry away positive energy @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 , @xmath51 be real numbers , then @xmath52    this follows directly from the triangle inequality for @xmath53 points in @xmath54 .",
    "now let @xmath55 and @xmath56 , then we have @xmath57 or equivalently @xmath58 thus we conclude : @xmath59      the penrose inequality further simplifies in the time - symmetric case , where the apparent horizon coincides with the outermost minimal surface .",
    "moreover , the dominant energy condition reduces now to non - negative scalar curvature of the cauchy hypersurface , leading to the riemannian version of the inequality .",
    "[ rpi ] let @xmath60 be a three dimensional strongly asymptotically flat riemannian manifold of non - negative scalar curvature , with an outermost minimal surface boundary @xmath61 of area @xmath62 , then @xmath63 with equality if and only if the manifold is a canonical slice of the schwarzschild spacetime .    the first published proof of this theorem was given by huisken - ilmanen in  @xcite using inverse mean curvature flow , but required the assumption that @xmath61 be connected .",
    "another proof by bray in  @xcite used a conformal flow and applied more generally to a non - connected boundary @xmath61 . nonetheless , one advantage of the first proof was that it could be immediately generalized to obtain the einstein - maxwell case  @xcite , i.e.  to prove theorem  [ thm - imcf ] in the case of a connected @xmath61 .",
    "it is important to point out that   implies both   and a lower bound : @xmath64 in fact this lower bound follows , when @xmath61 is connected , from the stability of the outermost horizon  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the absence of charges outside the horizon , the cauchy - schwartz inequality , the charged dominant energy condition , the stability of the outermost horizon , and the gauss - bonnet theorem , imply @xmath65 \\\\",

    "all these results are summarized in figure  [ graphical ] .",
    "the gauge group for the eaym matter model is @xmath73 .",
    "the connection , and the field strength @xmath74 , have values in the abelian lie algebra @xmath75 . as usual",

    "the eaym equations of motions are @xmath80 where barred quantities refer to spacetime objects , and greek indices run @xmath81 . from the expression for the energy - momentum - stress tensor",
    ", we obtain the energy density of the slice after contributions from the yang - mills fields have been removed : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the second fundamental form of the slice . in the time - symmetric case , @xmath84 , and the dominant energy condition",
    "is @xmath85 we note that the dominant energy condition is usually stronger , namely @xmath86 , while here we only use the weaker condition @xmath87 .",
    "the total charges are defined by @xmath88      the emd action has the lagrangian @xmath89 there are other emd models where the coupling @xmath90 is replaced by @xmath91 , in which @xmath92 is a coupling constant . while it is possible to conjecture a riemannian penrose inequality also for @xmath93",
    ", we leave this for future work . from the lagrangian ,",
    "one obtains the emd equations of motion @xmath94 as above @xmath95 in the time - symmetric case , @xmath84 and @xmath96 , thus from @xmath97 we get the emd dominant energy condition @xmath98 the charges contained in a surface @xmath99 are given by @xmath100 we note that if @xmath101 these charges depend only on the homology class of @xmath99 .",
    "the total charges are obtained by taking @xmath102 .",
    "a static spherically symmetric emd black hole was discovered by gibbons  @xcite : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the round metric on the unit 2-sphere .",
    "it was proven to be the unique static solution in  @xcite .",
    "we note that the scalar curvature of this emd black hole is given by @xmath105 and hence   is an equality in this case . for more details on this solution , see  @xcite .",
    "the proof follows directly from  @xcite , after noting that the only place which requires @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be divergence free is when one applies the inverse mean curvature flow at the end of the proof . according to the exhaustion",
    "result the flowing surfaces @xmath106 eventually become connected and enclose any large coordinate sphere .",
    "thus , if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are divergence free outside of a large coordinate sphere @xmath107 , then we may apply the inverse mean curvature flow argument once @xmath106 encloses @xmath107 .",
    "let the spherically symmetric metric be given by @xmath108 it is easy to check that @xmath109 is the hawking mass of the coordinate sphere @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , a horizon occurs at @xmath111 if @xmath112 .",
    "if @xmath109 is increasing there is only one horizon , hence @xmath113 is the outermost horizon .",
    "we will use the charged hawking mass  @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath3 is the total charge . note that on the horizon , we have @xmath115 and at infinity @xmath116 tends to the adm mass @xmath117 . clearly , if @xmath118 for    @xmath119 , then   will be violated",
    ". a violation of   with @xmath120 implies a violation of  .",
    "thus , in order to construct a counterexample it suffices to find two functions @xmath109 and @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , satisfying the following conditions :    a.   the charged dominant energy condition @xmath123 b.   total charge is @xmath3 : @xmath124 as @xmath125 . c.   the condition @xmath126 .",
    "d.   asymptotic flatness : @xmath127 as @xmath125 .",
    "e.   the inequality @xmath128    choose @xmath129 .",
    "we begin by solving @xmath130 so that @xmath131 and   is satisfied for @xmath119 .",
    "one finds @xmath132 clearly asymptotic flatness is satisfied , and in fact @xmath133 furthermore @xmath134 , and consequently @xmath135 , for @xmath119 . finally observe that @xmath136 it follows that we can find a function @xmath121 satisfying @xmath137 , the charged dominant energy condition @xmath138 for @xmath119 , and @xmath139 as @xmath125 .",
    "let @xmath140 denote the canonical slice of the reissner - nordstrm spacetime , and let @xmath141 denote the anisotropic radial coordinate for this data .",
    "consider the annulus @xmath142 where @xmath143 , and fix @xmath144 to be nonnegative and not identically zero . since the scalar curvature @xmath145 is nonconstant in @xmath142 , the formal @xmath146-adjoint of the linearized scalar curvature operator has trivial kernel .",
    "it then follows from @xcite that there exists a smooth contravariant 2-tensor @xmath147 , such that the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath148 is given by @xmath149 for @xmath150 sufficiently small .",
    "it is also clear from the proof in @xcite that if @xmath151 is chosen to be spherically symmetric , then @xmath152 is also spherically symmetric .",
    "define @xmath153 , and observe that @xmath154 since @xmath155 , the implicit function theorem may be used to find @xmath156 such that @xmath157 .",
    "therefore @xmath158 so that the initial data set @xmath159 satisfies the charged dominant energy condition .",
    "moreover , it is clear that this initial data set satisfies all desired hypotheses , except possibly the outermost condition for the minimal surface boundary .",
    "however , it can easily be seen that the minimal boundary is outermost by choosing @xmath160 sufficiently small .",
    "namely , by choosing @xmath160 sufficiently small , the mean curvature of each coordinate sphere @xmath107 , @xmath161 , remains positive .",
    "thus , the exterior region is foliated by surfaces of positive mean curvature , showing that no other minimal surface enclosing the boundary can exist ( by the maximum principle for minimal surfaces ) .",
    "apply a rotation @xmath162 so that all the transformed charges @xmath163 and @xmath164 vanish except possibly @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "if @xmath167 then the positive mass theorem with charge applies , and we get   as explained in the introduction . otherwise , starting with this new data , one may apply the proof in  @xcite , conformally deforming all the electromagnetic fields in the same manner @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "both the charged conformal flow and the inverse mean curvature flow arguments now proceed as in theorem  [ crpi - charges ] , and we obtain  . if there are no charges and equality holds , we obtain as in  @xcite that the transformed data is a canonical slice of reissner - nordstrm . after rotating back , we find that the original data is a canonical slice of an eaym reissner - nordstrm  black hole .    an initial data set for the emd equations consists of @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the initial time derivative of @xmath172 . in the time - symmetric case @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath171 vanish .",
    "we assume the data is strongly asymptotically flat , satisfies the emd dominant energy condition  , and that charges are absent , @xmath173 outside the horizon , or more generally outside a compact set .",
    "our first observation is that a penrose heuristic argument , as in section  [ penrose ] , is still valid .",
    "start from data with paramaters @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath174 , and assume the data settles to an emd black hole as in   with parameters @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath3 .",
    "then , the charge is conserved @xmath175 , the hawking area theorem applies giving @xmath176 , and as before the masses satisfy @xmath177 .",
    "since for the emd black hole we have @xmath178 it follows that @xmath179 and hence   holds for the initial data .",
    "we now point out a number of significant differences between this setting and our work in  @xcite .",
    "first , there are analogs of the majumdar - papapetrou multiple neck solutions  @xcite , but they do not pose an obstruction to the lower bound  . indeed , the right hand side of   is always monotone in @xmath9 unlike the right hand side of  , hence we do not expect an auxiliary inequality , such as the area / charge inequality in theorem  [ thm - imcf ] , to be necessary to prove  .",
    "these extremal solutions have , in a conformally related `` string '' metric , asymptotically cylindrical infinitely long necks just as in majumdar - papapetrou , but in the spacetime metric these have cross sectional area tending to zero at a finite distance",
    ". since we have @xmath180 in this case , with @xmath181 , there are emd black holes with nearby parameters that have a single connected component horizon , and charge to area radius ratio arbitrarily small .",
    "thus the phenomenon described in section  [ section - rpi ] whereby excess charge leads to high multiplicity of horizon components is absent in the emd model .",
    "the mathematical reason is that in the emd case , to replace the integral over @xmath99 with the integral over @xmath182 in inequality  , would require @xmath183 and @xmath184 to be divergence free rather than , as is assumed , @xmath29 and @xmath8 .",
    "notwithstanding these observations , the many similarities we now outline , lead us to surmise that the same approach used in  @xcite should apply in the emd setting .",
    "first , a positive mass theorem with charge holds  @xcite .",
    "[ dilaton - pmt ] let @xmath170 be a strongly asymptotically flat initial data set for the emd equations with an apparent horizon boundary , satisfying the emd dominant energy condition , with adm mass @xmath2 and total charge @xmath3 .",
    "if charge densities @xmath27 and @xmath18 vanish , then @xmath185    observe that the initial data is not assumed to be time - symmetric . on the other hand ,",
    "the rigidity statement has not yet been proved .",
    "we suspect that in analogy with the em case , equality holds if and only if the data can be embedded as a cauchy slice in one of the ghs static extremal emd solutions from  @xcite , and if the data is time - symmetric equality holds if and only if that slice is the cannonical slice .",
    "that said , contrary to  @xcite , theorem  [ dilaton - pmt ] likely plays no role in the proof of  .",
    "instead , we believe that an emd charged hawking mass @xmath186 exists as in  @xcite satisfying the following properties : ( i ) @xmath186 is monotonically non - decreasing under the huisken - ilmanen weak inverse mean curvature flow , and it is constant only for the central spheres in the spherically symmetric emd black hole ; ( ii ) @xmath186 converges to @xmath187 on the outermost horizon , and to the adm mass at infinity . this would prove conjecture  [ dilaton ] including the rigidity statement , provided the horizon is connected and there are no charges outside the horizon .",
    "finally , we conjecture that there exists an emd conformal flow satisfying : ( i ) the emd dominant energy condition is preserved under the flow ; ( ii ) the absence of charges is preserved under the flow ; ( iii ) the adm mass is monotonically non - increasing under the flow and constant only for the spherically symmetric emd black holes ; ( iv ) the area of the boundary is constant under the flow ; ( v ) the boundary eventually encloses any compact set on the original manifold .",
    "this would prove the full conjecture . for ( iii ) , a critical ingredient , used in both  @xcite and  @xcite , namely a conformal factor used to prove uniqueness in a doubling argument , is already available  @xcite ."
