    "relativistic laser - plasma interactions have been a topical issue for the past decade @xcite , in the context of ignitor physics of inertial confinement fusion , aiming at additional fast heating and subsequent ignition of highly compressed targets by means of an external intense laser pulse @xcite .",
    "the laser pulse drives relativistic currents , compensating return currents , and creates a pattern of counterpropagating currents which are subject to current filamentation instabilities ( cfi ) including the weibel mode @xcite . in the theoretical arena",
    ", numerous versions of analytical and numerical methods have been developed in the past , to explore this type of instabilities @xcite . in general ,",
    "the physical mechanism of the electromagnetic cfi is explained as follows : when the compensation of the counterpropagating electron currents is disturbed in the transverse direction , magnetic repulsion between the two currents reinforces the initial disturbance . as a consequence , a larger and larger magnetic field",
    "is produced as time increases , degrading the transport properties .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to this crucial problem , both related to laboratory electron beams @xcite as well as to astrophysics @xcite . concerning laser interaction with plasmas , for the",
    "low ( nonrelativistic ) intensity regimes the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption is known to predominate around the cutoff region , where the weibel - type instability associated with temperature anisotropy can take place @xcite . in the ablative plasmas ,",
    "the collisional and related nonlocal effects were investigated @xcite .",
    "the original motivation for this work was triggered by more recent publications that have been quantitatively treated with the counterstreaming relativistic cfi in the collisionless limit @xcite .",
    "a series of works could be linked with the ignitor physics by irradiating a relativistic laser pulse : fast ignition of the compressed fuel requires at least @xmath0 of external energy to be deposited within @xmath1 into the precompressed core @xcite .",
    "if carried by @xmath2 electrons , it implies a current of @xmath3 which exceeds the transport limit of about @xmath4 @xcite , by more than a factor @xmath5 . the essential feature is the breakup of the relativistic electron beam into many filaments when propagating in dense plasma @xcite .",
    "the physics underlying this phenomenon is just the cfi as mentioned above .",
    "this type of instability leads to nonlinear filamentation and coalescence of the relativistic electron beam @xcite and the formation of strong magnetic fields @xcite . in the astronomical point of view , one often encounters such morphology in a variety of celestial objects , particularly , in the astrophysical jets @xcite .",
    "state - of - the - art observations by utilizing very long baseline interferometry have revealed the filamentary structure of the jets @xcite , involving transverse magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "more recently , large - scale toroidal magnetic fields have been discovered in the galactic center @xcite , accompanied with splendid filamentary radio arcs @xcite .",
    "regarding the ignitor physics of laboratory plasmas , the effects of collisions and beam thermal spread play a significant role in the cfi caused by the ultrahigh relativistic currents through ablative coronal plasma @xcite , whose density rises from @xmath6 ( cutoff density ) to @xmath7 ( a thousand times solid density ) , over a radial distance of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the role of collisions in a laser - produced plasma has been discussed in the early literature by motz @xcite , though the description was restricted to the nonrelativistic fashion .",
    "it is important to note that the collision frequency invokes additional parameter disturbing the universal density scaling , in terms of the time scale of a plasma oscillation period @xmath9 and the spatioscale of a skin depth @xmath10 , which is valid only for collisionless regimes . in fully relativistic regimes ,",
    "the collision cross section should be evaluated by using the mott scattering formula @xcite . presuming a small angle scattering and averaging over the angle yield the electron - ion collision frequency that can be defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number density of ions , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the electron momentum , the electron rest mass , the averaged charge number , and the coulomb logarithm , respectively @xcite , and the electron - electron collision frequency is given as @xmath20 .",
    "introducing the current neutral condition of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the beam electron density , the plasma electron density , and its velocity , respectively , we find the ratio of @xmath25 for the plasma return current . when assuming @xmath26 to be almost constant , the ratio can be estimated as    @xmath27    equation  ( [ eq:0 ] ) indicates that indeed , collisional effects are important in the supersolid density regions of @xmath28 , and particularly , for the lorentz plasma with @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , the beam thermal spread will occur there , since the electrons penetrating through the ablative corona are expected to be thermalized via the collisional and collisionless dissipative processes @xcite .",
    "the thermal effects involved with the ratio of the transverse temperature to the total energy of beam electron , i.e. , @xmath30 with expected values in the range less than unity @xcite , which also disturbs the aforementioned scaling .",
    "in this paper , i present fundamental eigenmode properties and growth rates in the linear stage of the cfi including the effects that violate the universal density scaling .",
    "the theory is expanded in fully relativistic regime on the basis of the self - consistent beam - maxwell equations . to the best of my knowledge ,",
    "a comprehensive treatment of electron - electron and electron - ion collisional effects on relativistic counterstreaming electron currents with thermal spread has not been carried out , so far .",
    "for the symmetrically counterstreaming currents , i found that collisional and thermal effects are likely to lower the growth rate of the relativistic weibel instability .",
    "the most significant result is that the finite collisional coupling between electron and ion creates the growing oscillatory and the growing wave modes , which stand out for long - wavelength perturbations , and in the moderate to strong collisional regime , even for short - wavelength perturbations , the growth rate of the oscillatory mode exceeds that of the suppressed weibel instability . in this aspect ,",
    "the present work goes beyond the framework of the well - established theory of electromagnetic instabilities .",
    "the asymmetric configuration effects of the counterstreaming currents are also investigated by using a slow return current approximation .",
    "furthermore , i argue that the collisional coupling between electron and electron creates a growing wave mode , but its growth rate is lower than that of the suppressed weibel instability .",
    "it is also shown that thermal effects participate in lowering the growth rate of the weibel instability .",
    "although , in the case that includes thermal corrections , the present calculation is valid for the smaller wave number @xmath31 as shown later , the most interesting range @xmath32 can be fairly covered .    in order to spell out these subjects ,",

    "begin with the nonlinear beam - maxwell equations that include both friction and pressure terms . assuming the ions to be at rest and to provide a uniform charge - neutralizing background , we study the relativistic dynamics of two uniform , counterstreaming electron currents by employing the following set of equations in the dimensionless form ,    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the subscript @xmath40 , @xmath41 labels the two electron components and @xmath42 labels the countercomponent of @xmath43 , viz . , @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 , @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "the pressure of each electron components is connected with its density by a polytropic relation , which depends on the characteristic frequency @xmath64 and wave number @xmath31 of the mode being considered . as it is well known , in the case that the ratio of @xmath65 is much larger than the electron thermal speed , the adiabatic exponent of @xmath66 is adequate for the polytrope @xcite .",
