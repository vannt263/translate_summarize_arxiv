    "the aharonov - bohm effect predicted in ref.@xcite has been investigated in numerous papers , see review @xcite . due to this quantum effect , the vector potential affects the electron even in the case when the electron can not penetrate the region of non - zero magnetic field .",

    "one of the consequences of the aharonov - bohm effect is scattering of a charged particle in the field of an infinitesimally thin solenoid .",
