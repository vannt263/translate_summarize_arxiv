    "galaxies in which the star - forming gas has a metallicity smaller than a tenth of the solar metallicity are known as extremely metal - poor galaxies .",
    "since metals are primarily produced by stars , the star - forming gas in xmps is chemically primitive .",
    "they represent less than 0.1% of the objects in galaxy catalogs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "xmps can be divided into two types , according to their absolute magnitude .",
    "the first type is ultra - faint late - type galaxies , with @xmath2 . since galaxies follow a well known luminosity - metallicity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , those with @xmath2 should be xmps @xcite .",
    "such xmps are particularly rare in surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second type , with @xmath3 , corresponds to low metallicity outliers of the luminosity - metallicity relation . with high surface brightness",
    ", they dominate the catalogs of xmps , and they are the subject of our study .",
    "the evolutionary pathways of the two types probably differ . in this paper",
    "the term xmp refers exclusively to the second type .",
    "in addition to having chemically primitive star - forming regions , xmps also show signs of being structurally primitive , as if they were disks in early stages of assembly , with massive off - center starbursts providing them with a characteristic tadpole shape , with slowly rotating bodies , and with large spatially - unresolved turbulent motions . reinforcing such a primitive character ,",
    "their chemical composition is often non - uniform , with the lowest metallicities mostly in the regions of intense star formation .",
    "the existence of chemical inhomogeneities is particularly revealing because the timescale for mixing in disk galaxies is short , of the order of a fraction of the rotational period ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it implies that the metal - poor gas in xmps was recently accreted from a nearly pristine cloud , very much in line with the expected cosmic cold - flow accretion predicted to build disk galaxies @xcite , but which has been so difficult to test observationally .",
    "the gas expected in cosmological gas accretion events is described in detail by .",
    "thus , xmps seem to be local galaxies that are growing through the physical process that created and shaped disk galaxies in the early universe .",
    "they open up a gateway to study this fundamental process with unprecedented detail at low redshift .",
    "the presence of chemical inhomogeneities in most xmps is the touchstone of the whole scenario , since it unequivocally shows the star formation to be feeding from external metal - poor gas . in order to put the presence of these inhomogeneities on a firm observational basis , we measured the oxygen abundance along the major axes of ten xmps ( * ? ? ? * paper i ) , using a method based on models consistent with the direct method @xcite . in nine out of the ten cases ,",
    "sharp metallicity drops were found , leaving little doubt as to the existence and ubiquity of the drops .",
    "the present paper follows up on paper  i , and measures the kinematic properties of these xmps .",
    "the spectra used to infer metallicities in paper  i do not possess enough spectral resolution to carry out kinematic studies .",
    "therefore , a new set of observations was obtained .",
    "for this reason , the overlap with the original xmp sample is not complete .",
    "however , most of the original galaxies are examined here and show evidence for the star - forming regions having coherent motions , which also hints at the external origin of the galaxy gas .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath1 line presents multiple side lobes that seem to trace feedback processes of the star formation on the ism ( interstellar medium ) of the galaxies .",

    ", the two kinetic energies turn out to be similar too .",
    "this rough estimate leads to the conclusion that the mass loss rate and the kinetic energy involved in the global expansion of the star - forming region are similar to the values inferred for the emission features observed in the wings of h@xmath1 .",
    "the question arises as to whether the global expansion unbounds the gas in the starburst , and so may contribute to the global mass loss of the xmps . as was the case with the small expanding shells discussed above ,",
    "the answer to the question is very uncertain , and can not be addressed resorting to our observational data alone .",
    "the fate of the gas depends on the unknown value of the ism pressure .",
    "in contrast with the small shells , the expansion velocities are significantly smaller than the expected escape velocity . moreover ,",
    "the turbulent velocity of the galaxies is typically 4050 kms@xmath0 , and , hence , comparable , but larger , than the turbulent velocity in the star - forming region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dispersion ] ) .",
    "only if the density in the ism of the xmps is much lower than the density in the starburst , the starburst may be overpressureized and the mild observed expansion can drive gas through the ism to large distances .",
    "the xmp galaxies analyzed in paper  i are characterized by having a large star - forming region with a metal content lower than the rest of the galaxy .",
    "the presence of such chemical inhomogeneities suggests cosmological gas accretion as predicted in numerical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "cosmological gas accretion induces off - center giant star - forming clumps that gradually migrate toward the center of the galaxy disks @xcite .",
    "the star - forming clumps may be born in - situ or ex - situ . in the first case ,",
    "the accreted gas builds up the gas reservoir in the disk to a point where disk instabilities set in and trigger star formation . in the second case , already formed clumps are incorporated into the disk .",
    "they may come with stars and dark matter , and thus , they are often indistinguishable from gas - rich minor mergers @xcite .",
    "since they feed from metal - poor gas , the star - forming clumps are more metal - poor than their immediate surroundings @xcite . in order to complement the chemical analysis carried out in paper",
    "i , this second paper studies the kinematic properties of the ionized gas forming stars in the xmp galaxies .",
    "we study nine objects ( table  [ table_obs ] ) with a spectral resolution of the order of 7500 , equivalent to 40  kms@xmath0 in h@xmath1 .",
    "most xmps have a measurable rotation velocity , with a rotation amplitude which is only a few tens of kms@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rot_curve ] ) . all rotation curves present small - scale velocity irregularities , often with an amplitude comparable to the velocity gradient across the whole galaxy . on top of the large - scale motion , the galaxies also present turbulent motions of typically 50  kms@xmath0 fwhm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] and table  [ tab : mean_data ] ) , and , therefore , larger than the rotational velocities .",
    "observations suggest that the main star - forming region of the galaxy ( fig .  [",
    "fig : all_images ] ) moves coherently within the host galaxy .",
    "the velocity is constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] ) , so that the region moves as a single unit within the global rotation pattern of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the velocity dispersion in some of these large star - forming clumps increases toward the center - side of the galaxy .",
    "the excess velocity dispersion on the center - side may indicate an intensification of the turbulence of the gas that collides with the ism of the host galaxy , as if the clumps were inspiraling toward the galaxy center .",
    "this migration to the galaxy center is expected from tidal forces acting upon massive gas clumps , and the large starbursts in our xmps may be going through the process at this moment .",
    "in some other cases , the velocity dispersion has a local maximum at the core of the star - forming region , which suggests a global expansion of the whole region , with a moderate speed of around 15  kms@xmath0 .",
    "sometimes the velocity dispersion presents a minimum at the core , which may reflect a past global expansion that washed out part of the turbulent motions .",
    "we find no obvious relationship between the kinematic properties and the metallicity drops , except for the already known correlation between the presence of a starburst and the decrease in metallicity .",
    "we do find , however , a significant lack of correlation between the metallicity and the n / o ratio ( fig .  [ fig : oh_no ] ) , which is consistent with the gas accretion scenario .",
    "if the accretion of metal - poor gas is fueling the observed starbursts , then the fresh gas reduces the metallicity ( i.e. , o / h ) , but it can not modify the pre - existing ratio between metals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , forcing the n / o ratio to be similar inside and outside the starburst .",
    "the h@xmath1 line profile often shows a number of faint emission features , doppler - shifted with respect to the central component .",
    "their amplitudes are typically a few percent of the main component ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lobes ] ) , with the velocity shifts being between 100 and 400  kms@xmath0 ( table  [ tab : summary_lobes ] ) .",
    "the components are often paired , so that red and blue peaks , with similar amplitudes and shifts , appear simultaneously .",
    "the red components tend to be slightly fainter , however . assuming that the emission is produced by recombination of h",
    ", we have estimated the gas mass in motion , which turns out to be in the range between 10 and @xmath49 ( table  [ tab : summary_lobes ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_loading ] ) . assuming that the doppler shifts are produced by an expanding shell - like structure , we infer a mass loss rate between @xmath32 and a few @xmath75 .",
    "given the observed sfr , the mass loss rate yields a mass loading factor ( defined as the mass loss rate divided by the sfr ) typically in excess of 10 .",
    "large mass loading factors are indeed expected from numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they reflect the large feedback of the star formation process on the surrounding medium .",
    "numerical simulations predict that low mass galaxies are extremely inefficient in using their gas , most of which returns to the igm without being processed through the stellar mechanism .",
    "since the measured expansion velocities exceed by far the rotational and turbulent velocities , we argue in sect .",
    "[ sec : interpretation ] that the gas involved in the expansion is bound to escape from the galaxy disk , reaching the cgm and possibly the igm .",
    "therefore , the large mass loading factors that we measure support and constrain the predictions from numerical simulations .",
    "we have estimated the h column density to be expected when the shell material reaches the cgm , and it turns out to be around @xmath76  @xmath77 . even if all the h were neutral , this is undetectably small with present technology . moreover , at these low column densities , all h is expected to be ionized by the cosmic uv background . even if the igm of the xmps were filled by expanding shells from previous starbursts , they would be extremely elusive observationally .",
    "from an energetic point of view , the observed motions involve energies between @xmath78 and @xmath79  erg , which are in the range of the kinetic energy released by a core - collapse sn ( @xmath80  erg ) .",
    "the low - end energy requires that only part of the sn kinetic energy drives the observed expansion , whereas the high - end energy requires several sne going off quasi - simultaneously .",
    "the observed sfrs allow for the required number of sne , and the estimated age of the shells ( @xmath81@xmath45  yr ; table  [ tab : summary_lobes ] ) is also consistent with the expected sn rate .",
    "other alternatives to explain the weak emission peaks in the wings of h@xmath1 , like bh driving the motions or the expansion , can be discarded using physical arguments ( sect .",
    "[ sec : interpretation ] ) .",
    "some of the data suggest a moderate global expansion of the star - forming regions ( sect .",
    "[ sec : mydiscussion ] ) .",
    "even if the expansion velocity is small ( around 15  kms@xmath0 ) , the motion involves the mass of the whole region , and , hence , the associated mass loss rate and kinetic energy turn out to be similar to those carried away by the fast - moving secondary components .",
    "thus , global expansion may also be important in setting up the mass and energy budgets associated with star formation feedback .",
    "high redshift clumpy galaxies are probably growing through a cosmological gas accretion process similar to the one experienced by xmps .",
    "however , the physical conditions at high and low redshifts differ ( e.g. , the gas accretion rates are larger at high redshifts ) , so do the observational biases affecting xmps and high - redshift clumpies ( e.g. , low - mass galaxies are undetectable at high redshift ) . therefore ,",
    "addressing the issue of whether xmps are low - mass analogues of high - redshift clumpies is complicated , and so goes beyond the scope of our work . however , because of their probable common physics , it is interesting to point out some of the similarities and differences of the two samples . as in the case of xmps ,",
    "some clumpy galaxies show metallicity drops associated with enhanced star - formation activity .",
    "high redshift galaxies are significantly more massive than xmps .",
    "using as reference for high redshift galaxies ( 1.32.6 ) the sins sample @xcite , the stellar mass of the high - redshift objects ( @xmath82@xmath83@xmath84 ) is three orders of magnitude larger than the mass of xmps ( @xmath45@xmath85@xmath84 ; table  [ table_obs ] ) .",
    "this difference in stellar mass shows in dynamical mass too , with rotational velocities between 100 and 260kms@xmath0 at high redshift .",
    "we can not directly compare the rotational velocities of xmps with these values since we can not corrected for inclination , however , the uncorrected values go from zero to 30kms@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rot_curve ] ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion in xmps ranges from 10 and 20kms@xmath0 ( corresponding to fwhm between 25 and 50kms@xmath0 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] ) , whereas it is between 50 and 200kms@xmath0 at high - redshift @xcite .",
    "the high redshift objects have a ratio between rotational velocity and velocity dispersion between 0.5 and one @xcite .",
    "xmps seem to have similar ratios , even though we can not be more precise since the measured rotation in xmps is affected by inclination .",
    "the total sfrs are very different ( 10  500@xmath84yr@xmath0 at high redshift and 0.001  0.1@xmath84yr@xmath0 in xmps ) , but the surface star - formation rates are not ; they go from 0.01 to 10@xmath84yr@xmath0kpc@xmath86 at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from 0.005 to 0.8@xmath84yr@xmath0kpc@xmath86 in xmps ( paper  i ) .",
    "mass loading factors are one order of magnitude larger in xmps than those inferred for high - redshift clumpy galaxies ( sect .",
    "[ multiple_comp ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a difference that we attribute to their very different masses .",
    "however , the differences of size between the expanding regions of clumpies and xmps may also play a role ( see eq .  [ [ massloss ] ] ) .",
    "local uv bright clumply galaxies @xcite are often xmps with metallicity drops @xcite , and we know that their star - forming clumps resemble those in high - redshift cumplies in terms of total sfr , clump mass , and stellar mass surface density @xcite .",
