    "the superconducting ( sc ) compound fese , having the simplest crystal structure among other sc iron chalcogenides and pnictides , has attracted a great interest during the last years . primarily , this is connected with the possibility of a large alteration of their sc critical temperature t@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the moderate t@xmath0 of about 8k in bulk fese @xcite increases drastically up to 27 k under pressure @xcite and achieves even a maximum of 36.7k at 8.9gpa @xcite .",
    "such t@xmath0 enlargement is unlikely to be found for any other sc material . on the other hand",
    ", t@xmath0 climbs up to tremendous 109k in the case of a fese monolayer on srtio@xmath1 , as it has been shown by means of in situ electrical transport measurements @xcite .",
    "after that , various methods to increase t@xmath0 were utilized .",
    "one of them is doping of the fese topmost layer by excess electrons by covering the surface using alkali metals @xcite or applying the liquid - gating technique @xcite .",
    "however , as it was shown recently @xcite such doping has only a moderate effect , increasing t@xmath0 up to 20k of fese bulk crystal .",
    "that is , substrate - interfacial effects play the main role in increasing t@xmath0 in the case of fese monolayer on srtio@xmath1 , likely due to interface enhanced electron - phonon interaction .",
    "although fese monolayer has very high t@xmath0 , they survive , so far , only in - situ at high vacuum condition , while using of a protection layer suppresses high - t@xmath0 superconductivity in fese monolayer @xcite .",
    "recently , an increase of t@xmath0 almost twice than that of the bulk crystals , was reported for atmosphere - stable fese films with a practical thickness of about several hundred nanometers @xcite .",
    "this increase has been explained by proper tuning the fe - vacancy disorders via changing the fe / se ratio . in this communication",
    ", we report about the observation of more than doubling of t@xmath0 onset in point - contacts ( pcs ) created on a bulk fese single crystal .",
    "we believe that our results provide helpful information in order to understand in more detail the role of the interface to modify the properties of superconducting fese .",
    "the plate - like single crystals ( flakes ) of fese@xmath2 ( @xmath3=0.04@xmath40.02 , # cd-946 ) superconductor were grown in evacuated quartz ampoules using alcl@xmath1/kcl flux technique in a permanent temperature gradient as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "resistivity and magnetization measurements revealed a sc transition temperature t@xmath0 up to 9.4k @xcite and an onset of superconductivity at about 10k .",
    "pcs were established by touching of a sharpened thin cu wire ( @xmath5=0.2 mm ) to the @xmath6-plane of fese cleaved by a scalpel at room temperature or contacting by the wire an edge of the plate - like samples .",
    "thus , we have measured heterocontacts between normal metal cu and the fese crystal mostly along two directions .",
    "the differential resistance @xmath7 of pc was recorded by sweeping the @xmath8 current @xmath9 on which a small @xmath10 current @xmath11 was superimposed using a standard lock - in technique .",
    "the measurements were performed in the temperature range from 3k up to 25k . no principal difference in @xmath12 data",
    "was observed for `` plane '' or `` edge '' pc geometry , because @xmath12 differ more significantly from one pc to another .",
    "typical @xmath12 data for pcs with different resistance are shown in fig.1 in our previous publication @xcite .",
    "for low - ohmic pcs with resistance up to several ohms the main feature in @xmath12 is a pronounced sharp zero - bias minimum @xcite . for the overwhelming majority of pcs , independently ,",
    "either @xmath12 demonstrate additionally occasional andreev - reflection like features or not curves allows to conclude about regime ( ballistic , diffusive or thermal)@xcite of current flow in superconducting pcs .",
    "in general , the critical temperature has no relation to this regime of current flow through a pc .",
    "moreover , the heating and critical current effects do not play a role at t@xmath13 determination , since the disappearance of superconductivity in pc we can monitor watching the minimum in @xmath14 at zero bias ( or at zero current ) . on the other hand , the critical temperature itself can be a criteria of the pc quality .",
    "when it is lower than the bulk value , it means that the pc quality is low . ]",
    "( see , e.g. figs .",
    "4 & 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this minimum and accompanying side maxima disappear at temperature around 10k . in pc",
    ", we took the temperature at which the zero - bias minimum disappears , as was marked by the dotted circle in figs .",
    "this range was a bit ( 12k ) higher for some of the pcs .",
    "unexpectedly , we have found pcs ( one pc created by `` edge '' geometry and one pc created on @xmath6-plane ) , where sc features were observed to break down only above 20k , as it is shown in figs.1 & 2 .",
    "the statistic of the variation of t@xmath13 with the pc resistance is shown in fig.3 .",
    "thereby , we claim to observe a doubling of the local t@xmath13 in a restricted geometry of the fese crystal , which is determined by the pc size .",
    "the latter was estimated in our previous paper @xcite for a pc with similar resistance to be in the range of 0.1 - 1@xmath15 m .",
    "the large uncertainty in the determination of the pc size is due to the unknown residual resistivity of fese at the interface with cu and due to the heterocontact geometry , where the partial filling of the pc volume by one ( fese ) or another ( cu ) material is unknown .",
    "curves with temperature for a pc created by touching of an edge of a fese crystal by a cu wire .",
    "the upper two curves marked by the circle are measured at 18 and 22k ( top curve ) .",
    "right inset shows two @xmath14 curves measured at 4 and 18k for a larger bias .",
    "left inset shows the dependence of the pc resistance at zero - bias versus temperature .",
    "dotted lines are given to guide the eye .",
    "[ fig : fig1],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the first thought that comes to mind about increasing of t@xmath0 in pc is that it is connected with a pressure effect .",
    "indeed , the small size of a pc ( or more precisely speaking , the small contact area , which , in general , can be larger than that of metallic contact itself due to , e.g. , surface oxides ) , which can be in the order of a few microns , make it possible to cause large pressure ( by mechanical creation of pc ) within the pc core . according to fig.4 in ref.@xcite , to reach the onset critical temperature of about 20k",
    ", the pressure should exceed 1gpa . at the same time , we believe that metallic cu wire can not produce a pressure larger than the yield strength of cu .",
    "the latter reaches only about 0.07gpa and can not be much larger at low temperature .",
    "another observation that contradicts the pressure explanation of the t@xmath0 increase comes from fig.3 .",
    "intuitively it is clear that the pressure in a pc is expected to be larger for pcs with larger resistance or respectively smaller size .",
    "contrary , as shown in fig.3 , two pcs with smaller resistance ( larger size ) exhibit a two - times higher t@xmath13 than the other pcs .",
    "probably , the pressure effect is responsible mainly for the t@xmath13 scattering between 10 and 14k as seen in fig.3 .",
    "curves with temperature for pc created by touching of @xmath6-plane of fese flake by a cu wire .",
    "the upper two curves marked by circle are measured at 20 and 22k ( top curve ) .",
    "right inset shows @xmath14 measured at 3 , 12 and 22k for a larger bias .",
    "left inset shows dependence of the pc resistance at zero - bias versus temperature .",
    "full ( red ) circles show corrected pc resistance after subtracting from resistance increase above 12k ( as it is seen from the shifting of @xmath14 `` background '' at larger bias ) coming , likely , from the bulk .",
    "dotted line is given to guide the eye .",
    "[ fig : fig2],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    an enhancement of t@xmath0 in pcs was observed also in co - doped ba-122 @xcite and in fete@xmath16se@xmath17 @xcite iron - based superconductors . in both cases this enhancement was about 30% , that is much less than we observe . in the first case , the authors suppose the formation of phase - incoherent quasiparticle pairs at a temperature well above t@xmath0 arising from strong fluctuation of the phase of the complex superconducting order parameter . in the second case ,",
    "the authors assume also novel quasiparticle scattering due to strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations . as to our case",
    ", we do not believe that such kind of fluctuations is able to increase t@xmath0 on 100% .    different scenario to explain the t@xmath0 rise in fese films may be a fortunate arrangement of iron vacancies somewhere at the interface , as assumed in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , t@xmath13 in that fese films was found to increase only up to about 15k that is 5k lower than in our case .",
    "nevertheless , it can not be excluded also the joint effect of pressure and iron vacancy arrangement , that might result in 20k onset superconductivity in our pcs .",
    "however , high pressure in pc will result rather in disarrangement of the fe vacancies .",
    "alternatively , the observed t@xmath0 increase may be an interfacial effect due to additional doping @xcite and/or interface - enhanced electron - phonon coupling @xcite from the side of the normal metal .",
    "thus , a real understanding of the observed t@xmath0 rise in pcs on the base of fese is a challenging task . in this case",
    ", the restricted pc geometry and interfacial effects can play a decisive role .",
    "variation for pcs with different resistance .",
    "horizontal stripe marks t@xmath13 for a bulk fese taken from the resistance data shown in the inset .",
    "inset : resistance versus temperature of fese sample from ref.@xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig3],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in summary , we have investigated the nonlinear conductivity of pcs on the base of fese single crystals due to the transition into the sc state .",
    "we found that sc features in the differential resistance @xmath12 persist up to 20k for some pcs .",
    "such doubling of the local critical temperature in fese can not be explained only by pressure effects in the pc . as a possible explanation a suitable arrangement of iron vacancies",
    "is discussed along with the presence of pressure .",
    "apparently , the underlying physical nature of the observed effect can be understood by taking into account the restricted geometry of the pc core and interfacial effects .",
