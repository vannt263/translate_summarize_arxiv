    "one of the primary tools for studying the evolution and formation of structure within the universe has been the angular correlation function @xcite .",
    "possibly the simplest of these point process statistics is the angular 2-point function which measures the excess number of pairs of galaxies , as a function of separation , when compared to a random distribution .",
    "if the universe can be described by a gaussian random process then the 2-point function will fully describe the clustering of galaxies . while this is clearly not the case and higher order correlation functions play a significant role in understanding the clustering of structure and its evolution",
    ", the 2-point function remains an important statistical tool . in this paper",
    "we will utilize the angular 2-point function to determine the type and luminosity dependence of the clustering of galaxies within the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "studying the angular correlation function has a natural advantage over the spatial or redshift correlation function . by only requiring positional information",
    "we can derive the clustering signal from photometric surveys alone ( i.e.  without requiring spectroscopic followup observations ) . given the relative efficiencies of photometric surveys over their spectroscopic counterparts ,",
    "this enables the correlation function to be estimated for wide - angle surveys covering statistically representative volumes of the universe and without being limited by discreteness error .",
    "the disadvantage of the angular correlation function has been that it is the projection of the spatial correlation function over the redshift distribution of the galaxy sample . for",
    "bright magnitude limits the redshift distribution is well known ( and relatively narrow ) and therefore deprojecting the angular clustering to estimate the clustering length is relatively straightforward . at fainter magnitudes",
    "the redshift distribution becomes broader and the details of the clustering signal can be washed out .",
    "we can overcome many of the disadvantages of the angular clustering if we utilize photometric redshifts .",
    "photometric redshifts provide a statistical estimate of the redshift , luminosity and type of a galaxy based on its broadband colors . as we can control the redshift interval from which we select the galaxies ( and the distribution of galaxy types and luminosities )",
    "we can determine how the clustering signal evolves with redshift and invert it accurately to estimate the real space clustering length , @xmath2 , for galaxies .",
    "the ability to utilize large , multicolor photometric surveys as opposed to the smaller spectroscopic samples means that we can subdivide the galaxy distributions by luminosity and type without being limited by the size of the resulting subsample ( i.e.  most of our analyzes will not be limited by shot noise ) .",
    "as we expect the dependence of the clustering signal to vary smoothly with luminosity , type and redshift , it is not expected that the statistical uncertainties in the redshift estimates will significantly bias our resulting measures .",
    "the utility of photometric redshifts for measuring the clustering of galaxies as a function of redshift and type has been recognized when studying high redshift galaxies @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on studying the angular clustering of intermediate redshift galaxies @xmath7 and the dependence of the clustering length on luminosity and galaxy type .",
    "this represents one of the first applications of the photometric redshifts to the clustering of intermediate redshift galaxies for which we have a large , homogeneously and statistically significant sample of galaxies .",
    "this paper is divided into five sections . in section 2",
    "we describe the data set used in this analysis and the selection of a volume limited sample of galaxies . in section 3",
    "we apply a novel approach for estimating the 2-point angular correlation function using fast fourier transforms and we show the dependence of the slope and amplitude of the correlation function on luminosity and galaxy type . in section 4",
    "we invert the projected angular correlation function and derive the correlation lengths . in section 5",
    "we discuss the bimodal behavior of clustering properties .",
    "the sdss is a photometric and spectroscopic survey designed to map the distribution of stars and galaxies in the local and intermediate redshift universe @xcite . on completion",
    "the sdss will have observed the majority of the northern sky ( @xmath8 steradians ) and approximately 1000 square degrees in the southern hemisphere .",
    "these observations are undertaken in a drift - scan mode where a dedicated 2.5 m telescope scans along great circles , imaging 2.5 degree wide stripes of the sky .",
    "the imaging data is taken using a mosaic camera @xcite through the five photometric passbands @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( covering the ultraviolet through to the near infrared ) as defined in @xcite . the photometric system is described in detail by @xcite and the photometric monitor by @xcite .",
    "all data are reduced by an automated software pipeline @xcite and the outputs loaded in to a commercial sql database . in our analysis , we will include data from runs with the longest contiguous scans ( typically in excess of 50 degrees ) .",
    "these data comprise a subset of the data that will be released to the public as part of data release @xcite . in comparison to the early data release @xcite",
    "the area analyzed in this paper is approximately @xmath14 times larger , or approximately 20% of the entire survey area .",
    "given the five band photometry from the sdss imaging data we estimate the photometric redshifts of the galaxies using the techniques outlined in @xcite .",
    "the details of the estimation techniques employed together with the expected uncertainties within the redshift estimators are given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will just note the effective rms error of the photometric redshifts ( typically @xmath15 at @xmath16 ) .",
    "for all sources within a sample the redshift and its uncertainty are calculated together with a measure of the spectral type of the galaxy and its variance and covariance ( with redshift ) . from these measures",
    "we estimate the luminosity distance to each galaxy and calculate its r - band absolute magnitude .      from the current photometric data in the sdss archives we extract eight stripes for our analysis . these stripes combine to form approximately five coherent regions on the sky which range from approximately 90 degrees to about 120 degrees in length . in the nomenclature of the sdss",
    "these stripes are designated the numbers 1012 , 3537 and 76 and 86 .",
    "the last two stripes come from the southern component of the survey .",
    "all data from these stripes have been designated as having survey quality photometric observations and astrometry .",
    "in total these stripes add up close to 20 million galaxies and are accessible through the sdss science archive @xcite .",
    "currently , there are two versions of the sdss science archive running at fermilab and remotely accessible to the collaboration .",
    "the `` chunk '' database contains stripes that have passed through the target selection process for identifying candidates for spectroscopic followup but with only photometry that was available when the spectroscopic target selection was run on the region ( i.e.  photometry for which the calibrations were not necessarily optimal ) .",
    "the `` staging '' database has the latest photometric data ( for this paper we use the _ ver .",
    "5.2.8 _ of the photometric pipeline ) but without the full target selection information .",
    "for our purposes the quality of the photometric measurements is important but the target selection is completely irrelevant and thus we take our sample from the staging database .    in order to be able to efficiently store ,",
    "search and select galaxies from the catalog , we create a local database using microsoft s sql server .",
    "the relevant properties ( position , redshift , galaxy type , absolute and apparent magnitudes ) of all galaxies in the staging database were stored in this database server .",
    "the regions of the sky surveyed by these data , the seeing of the observations as a function of position on the sky and the position of bright stars that must be masked out when defining the survey geometry were all calculated internally from this data set .    from these data",
    "we restrict our sample to galaxies brighter than @xmath17 . at this magnitude limit",
    "the star - galaxy separation is sufficiently accurate that it will not affect the angular clustering measures @xcite and the photometric redshift errors are typically less than @xmath18 @xcite . applying this magnitude limit yields approximately 13 million galaxies from which to estimate the clustering signal .",
    "the sample was further restricted by excluding those regions of the stripes affected by the wings of bright stars or that were observed with poor seeing .",
    "figure  [ fig : binned ] shows the density of galaxies in stripe 11 with the masks over - plotted .",
    "fields with seeing worse than @xmath19 and a @xmath20 neighborhood around all bright stars with @xmath21 were discarded .",
    "we note that these selections were all accomplished by applying a series of sql queries to the database rather than progressively pruning a catalog of galaxies .",
    "the boundaries of the stripes , the seeing on a field - by - field basis and all bright stars were stored in the local database , so that masks could be generated on the fly over the area to be analyzed .",
    "as such the selection criteria that were applied to the database could be optimized in a relatively short period of time",
    ".      often the clustering evolution of galaxies , particularly that defined by angular clustering studies , is characterized as a function of limiting magnitude . while observationally this is simple to determine , the results of these analyzes are often difficult to interpret because in a magnitude limited sample the mix of the spectral types and absolute luminosities of galaxies is redshift dependent .",
    "we are , essentially , looking at the clustering properties of different types of galaxies as a function of limiting magnitude .",
    "the models to account for the clustering signal must , therefore , also be able to describe the evolution of the distribution of galaxies .",
    "ideally we would separate out the effects of population mixing and study the evolution of angular clustering in terms of the intrinsic properties of galaxies ( i.e.  rest - frame color and luminosity ) , along with their distances .",
    "we can accomplish this if we use the photometric redshifts to select a volume limited sample of galaxies ( i.e.  one with a fixed absolute magnitude range as a function of redshift ) .",
    "the sdss early data release photometric redshift catalog by @xcite is based on techniques @xcite that estimate the physical parameters describing the galaxy samples in a self - consistent way .",
    "the relationship for the edr data set is applied to the photometric data selected from the imaging stripes and the spectral types , absolute magnitudes and k - corrections are stored within a database together with the photometric and positional information .",
    "all derived quantities assume an @xmath22 cosmology with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : absmagz ] illustrates how the absolute magnitude limits in the @xmath26 band vary as a function of redshift .",
    "these absolute magnitude boundaries are well defined , as a function of redshift , by the galaxies within our sample . in this paper",
    "we study a volume - limited sample that extends out to a redshift @xmath27 with limiting absolute magnitude @xmath28 .",
    "we further restrict the data set to those galaxies more distant than redshift @xmath29 .",
    "the reason for this lower redshift limit is that the main spectroscopic galaxy sample will contain many of the low redshift galaxies , so using photometric redshift estimates is not necessary .",
    "also the fractional error in @xmath30 becomes large at lower redshifts due to uncertainty in the phototometric redshifts .",
    "the final catalog size is over 2 million galaxies .      to analyze how angular clustering changes with luminosity in section  3 , the volume limited sample is divided into 3 absolute magnitude bins .",
    "these subsamples represented by @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 have limiting absolute magnitudes @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . the size of these subsets decrease by approximately a factor of two as a function of increasing luminosity .    for",
    "the type dependent selection we utilize the continuous spectral type parameter @xmath37 from the photometric redshift estimation .",
    "this essentially encodes the rest - frame colors of the galaxies as there is a direct one - to - one mapping between the type @xmath37 and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the galaxy .",
    "the value @xmath38 represents a template galaxy that is as red as the elliptical spectrum of @xcite ; as @xmath37 increases the galaxy type becomes progressively later . in section  3 ,",
    "we subdivide by spectral class breaking the luminosity classes into four subgroups ( each with comparable numbers of galaxies ) .",
    "the cuts in the spectral type parameter @xmath37 from red to blue are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the cuts are defined as the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 subsamples respectively .",
    "our selection is motivated by the spectral energy distributions of @xcite .",
    "the first class consists of galaxies with seds similar to the cww elliptical template ( ell ) , the second , third and fourth classes contain a broader distribution of galaxy types approximately corresponding to sbc , scd and irr types , respectively .",
    "the distribution of types and our classification are shown in figure  [ fig : typehist ] and [ fig : select ] .",
    "the properties of the angular correlation function and the estimators used to measure it from photometric catalogs have been extensively discussed in the astronomical literature @xcite .",
    "the probability of finding galaxy within a solid angle @xmath47 on the celestial plane of the sky at distance @xmath48 from a randomly chosen object is given by @xcite @xmath49\\ \\delta\\omega , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the mean number of objects per unit solid angle .",
    "the angular two - point correlation function @xmath51 basically gives the excess probability of finding an object compared to a uniform poisson random point process .",
    "traditionally the observations are compared to random catalogs that match the geometry of the survey .",
    "the computation usually consists of counting pairs of objects drawn from the actual and random catalogs and applying a minimum variance estimator such as that defined by @xcite or @xcite . in this study",
    ", we use the landy - szalay estimator @xcite as @xmath52 where dd , rr and dr represent a count of the data - data , random - random and data - random pairs with @xmath48 angular separation summed over the entire survey area .",
    "even though distances on the sky are easy to compute mathematically , measuring the correlation function is not a trivial task , especially when it comes to large surveys .",
    "it s easy to see that any naive algorithm implementing the estimator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimator ] ) scales with the square of the number of objects @xmath53 in the survey , @xmath54 .",
    "it , therefore , becomes progressively more expensive in computational power to apply these techniques to data the size of the sdss samples .",
    "we propose a novel method to estimate @xmath51 using the fast fourier transform ( e.g.  in * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fft ) , which scales as @xmath55 , a significant improvement over the naive approach .",
    "the principle behind this is to group all galaxies into small cells within a grid and analyze this matrix instead of the point catalog .",
    "the implementation of this fft approach called espice is a euclidean version of spice by @xcite .",
    "a discussion on its properties and scalings is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we present an application of espice to the sdss galaxy angular clustering and limit our discussion of the algorithm to only an outline of how the method works .    to apply a standard fft analysis to the problem we operate in euclidean space .",
    "in other words , euclidean distances are computed instead of the correct angular separation . given that we only examine separations of less than 2 degrees , the maximum relative distance error introduced by the use of the euclidean approximation",
    "is only 0.00005 .",
    "this has a negligible effect on the accuracy of our analysis , and the use of euclidean distances increases the speed of the algorithms significantly .",
    "we use sdss survey coordinates ( @xmath56 ) to define the position of an object within a stripe .",
    "these coordinates are defined locally for each stripe .",
    "as the individual stripes comprise great circles on a sphere the survey coordinates along these great circles are close to euclidean ( i.e.  in this coordinate system every stripe looks as if it were equatorial ) .",
    "in fact for equatorial stripes 10 and 82 , the ( @xmath56 ) coordinates are the same as ( ra , dec ) . beyond the above _ data _ grid of galaxies , we need to describe the geometry of the survey area .",
    "this is done by a second grid , with the same dimensions that describes the survey boundaries .",
    "we call this the _ window _ grid because it is 1 if the pixel is entirely inside the boundaries and 0 otherwise . in this way",
    "we can also incorporate arbitrarily complex masks ( e.g.  for excluding regions around bright stars ) as they are simply applied to the window grid .",
    "the data and window grids are then padded with zeros up to the maximum angular scale to avoid aliasing in the fast fourier transform .",
    "finally , espice is used to calculate the two - point correlation function directly .",
    "our approach is to apply this algorithm to one stripe at a time .",
    "the data and window matrices are constructed by querying the sql database to select the appropriate galaxies and masks . from these data",
    "we calculate the two - dimensional angular correlation function for all eight stripes .",
    "figure  [ fig : twodim ] shows the 2d correlation function for all stripes used in this analysis .",
    "we find that the 2d correlation function is an extremely sensitive diagnostic tool for identifying systematics within the photometric data .",
    "the correlation function is expected to be isotropic .",
    "artifacts within the data or survey geometry distort this symmetry .",
    "this is seen , to varying degrees , in each of the eight 2d correlations functions .",
    "we find that within the 2d correlation function there is an elongated streak , at zero lag , along the scan direction which has structure on scales in excess of a few degrees .",
    "this arises due to errors in the flat - field vector .    in a drift - scan survey",
    "the flat field is a one - dimensional vector ( orthogonal to the direction of the scan ) .",
    "errors within the flat field tend , therefore , to be correlated along the scan direction ( i.e.  along the columns of a stripe ) .",
    "this effect is seen within all of the individual stripe correlation functions . as it is , by definition , a zero lag effect we can exclude it from the analysis by censoring this region of the 2d correlation function before azimuthally averaging the signal to get a 1d correlation function .",
    "we note , however , that even if we do not censor the data to remove this effect the result of averaging the correlation function azimuthally ( and the fact that this elongated streak only affects a small fraction of the 2d correlation function ) the results discussed in the following sections are not affected .    in total , the computation of the one - dimensional angular correlation function @xmath51 takes less than 3 minutes for a stripe , which is several orders of magnitude faster than traditional two - point estimators .",
    "having computed the correlation function for all stripes , we co - add the results by properly weighting with the number of galaxy pairs . at the same time",
    "the covariance of the signal is also estimated from the scatter between the different stripes figure  [ fig : covar ] shows the covariance matrix for the volume limited sample ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the image of the matrix is normalized so that the diagonal elements are always white and the ( off - diagonal ) gray scale values represent the correlation between the bins . because of the logarithmic sampling of @xmath51 , the neighboring bins are farther apart and hence correlate progressively less as we go to larger scales and thus to larger bins .      with the measured correlation amplitudes as function of angular separation in hand ,",
    "we can obtain a parametric form of the scaling . the amplitude and power of the correlation",
    "are calculated by fitting the usual formula , @xmath57 normalizing @xmath48 by @xmath58 enables the amplitude @xmath59 be directly compared with the figures showing @xmath51 measurements ; @xmath59 is essentially the value of the correlation function at @xmath60 , since @xmath61 .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath62 are estimated by minimizing the cost function @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath53 is the number of bins and @xmath65 is the covariance matrix .",
    "although , @xmath66 is not quadratic in the parameter @xmath62 , it is in @xmath59 , thus the equation @xmath67 can be solved analytically for @xmath59 to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "we then use a method by @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to search for the optimal value of @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath68 fit also provides information about the covariances of the estimated parameters that are shown as error ellipses in the next section .",
    "figure  [ fig : fid ] illustrates the angular clustering in our fiducial sample of all galaxies within the volume limited sample . in the left panel , the correlation function @xmath51 is shown along with the best power - law fit .",
    "the range in angular separation varies from 1 arcminute to 2 degrees . at a mean redshift for the volume - limited sample of @xmath69",
    ", @xmath70 corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "the error bars on the measurements are computed as one over the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix ( e.g.  shown in figure  [ fig : covar ] ) . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : fid ] , we plot the best fit parameters and their error ellipses . for the full volume - limited sample the best fit to the data",
    "has a slope of @xmath72 with an amplitude of .",
    "the angular clustering of the galaxies in the three luminosity bins described in section 3 are compared in figure  [ fig : lum ] . as noted earlier",
    ", the left panel shows the correlation function , and the right panel gives the parameters of the power - law fits . the first section ( i ) of table",
    "[ tbl : all ] presents the values and errors on these measured parameters .",
    "as expected , the more luminous galaxies are clustered more strongly : the amplitudes are roughly larger by a factor of 1.5 from one sample to the next and are measured to be @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . the slope of the correlation functions are consistent for all luminosity bins and with the fiducial value derived for the entire volume ( the estimated slope parameters scatter around @xmath76 ) .",
    "the type dependence of the correlation function is not as simple as that found for the luminosity classes .",
    "it is well known that different types of galaxies have different clustering behavior @xcite .",
    "red elliptical galaxies are more likely to be found in higher density regions than spirals . here , we study the evolution of the angular correlation function with spectral type in two absolute magnitude ranges , @xmath34 and @xmath77 .",
    "both of these yield approximately 1 million galaxies within our volume .",
    "figure  [ fig : lo ] shows how the clustering changes as a function of spectral type in the lower luminosity sample .",
    "the 2 reddest classes of the galaxy population ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) are essentially indistinguishable , their clustering is significantly stronger than for the other classes or our fiducial results .",
    "the bluest 2 classes ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) have approximately the same power - law exponents but with different amplitudes . section ii of table  [ tbl : all ] summarizes the results of parameter fitting , which is also seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : lo ] .",
    "the higher luminosity classes show the same basic trends but with a stronger correlation amplitude .",
    "the results of the type dependence of power law fits to the high luminosity class are given in figure  [ fig : hi ] and table  [ tbl : all ] .",
    "from the angular clustering we can derive the spatial correlation length , @xmath2 , given the redshift distribution of the data @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by integrating over the comoving coordinate along two lines of sight @xmath78 and @xmath79 , separated by the angle @xmath48 , to calculate the projected angular correlations from the real - space correlation function @xmath80 , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the selection function and the factor @xmath83 accounts for the curvature of space .",
    "would be constant @xmath84 because the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath25 assume a flat universe , however , we will do the integral in redshift ( see later ) . ] in the small angle approximation , the correlation function @xmath86 becomes @xmath87 using variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this simplifies the above integral , because one can separate out the part that has @xmath90 and arrive at @xmath91 where @xmath92 we can rewrite the integral using redshift @xmath30 and its distribution . substituting @xmath93 one gets the final integral of @xmath94 that may be compared to the measured quantities directly .",
    "we have assumed that the selection function and the redshift distribution are normalized to @xmath95 , which can be easily achieved numerically .      to determine the correlation length",
    ", we need to estimate @xmath96 . given a photometric redshift and its random error",
    ", there is a conditional probability of having a galaxy at a certain true redshift .",
    "in addition , we need to incorporate the apparent magnitude limit and photometric redshift selection criteria in the estimate of the redshift distribution .",
    "the real redshift @xmath30 and the photometric redshift @xmath97 of a galaxy are different .",
    "we assume that @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the error and drawn from a normal distribution .",
    "thus @xmath100 where @xmath101 determines the precision of the estimates .",
    "we need the inverse : what is the true redshift , given the photometric estimate .",
    "this may be obtained from bayes theorem , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the true redshift distribution calculated from the lf that also depends on the apparent magnitude cuts .",
    "our volume limited sample is selected by a window function of photometric redshifts , @xmath104 the conditional probability of having a galaxy in a sample selected by this window function is calculated by the integral over the distribution @xmath105 , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the photometric redshift selection function convolved with the photometric redshift uncertainty .",
    "the precision of photometric redshifts is a strong function of the apparent magnitude . from the photometric redshift catalog ,",
    "we compute the mean redshift errors @xmath108 and the galaxy counts @xmath109 ( for proper weighting ) in @xmath110 wide magnitude bins . using the lf by @xcite , we derive the redshift distributions @xmath111 for the same magnitude bins up to @xmath17 , which is the limiting magnitude in the sample .",
    "the final redshift distribution is the weighted average of these probabilities , @xmath112 the top panel of figure  [ fig : dndz ] illustrates the redshift distribution derived from the lf for galaxies with @xmath113 and a smoothed window @xmath107 with @xmath114 .",
    "the middle panel shows the effective contribution of this magnitude bin to the final @xmath96 , which is plotted in the last panel .      applying the above probabilistic redshift distribution and substituting the power - law",
    "fits derived earlier , we find a correlation length for the full volume limited sample of @xmath115 . estimating the uncertainty of this value is not trivial .",
    "the statistical errors on the parametric fits to @xmath51 are known and may be used to estimate the errors on the correlation length .",
    "these are estimated by calculating the scatter of the predicted @xmath2 measurements for 20,000 monte - carlo realizations of the fitting parameters , @xmath59 and @xmath62 , based on their covariance matrix .",
    "for the full volume limited sample , we obtain @xmath116 . however , the uncertainty on @xmath2 is also affected by the uncertainty in the redshift distribution .",

    "we find that the evolutionary parameter @xmath120 makes the largest difference , the @xmath2 errors from the uncertainty of @xmath121 and @xmath122 are negligible .",
    "for the fiducial @xmath2 value , we estimate an error of @xmath123 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath101 on the apparent magnitude was determined empirically using the actual measurements , thus the results are not affected by malmquist bias .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rnut ] , the correlation length is plotted as a function of luminosity ( _ left panel _ ) and sed type ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and luminosity and spectral type are consistent with that observed directly from the angular data and from measures of the clustering length from spectroscopic surveys @xcite . over an absolute magnitude range of @xmath124 to @xmath125 , @xmath2 increases with luminosity from a value of @xmath126 to @xmath127 , which is consistent with the increase observed by @xcite .",
    "the color dependence of @xmath2 ( i.e.  clustering as a function of spectral type ) shows the expected increase in clustering length for early type galaxies .",
    "the values of the correlation length for the spectral type subsamples are given in table  [ tbl : all ] .",
    "in the lower luminosity bin red , @xmath43 , galaxies have a correlation length of @xmath3 for the @xmath128 sample and the bluest galaxies , @xmath46 , have a correlation length of @xmath5 .",
    "the trend in this relation is again consistent with the observed dependence of the correlation length as a function of spectral and morphological type @xcite .",
    "the interesting aspect of the luminosity and color dependent clustering is not that the observed clustering length scales with luminosity and color as this has been demonstrated from many different surveys .",
    "it arises from how the shape of the correlation function depends on luminosity and color .",
    "it is remarkable that the luminosity simply effects the amplitude of the correlation function and not the slope , whereas the type selection affects both the slope and amplitude .",
    "this is particularly intriguing when we note that we would expect an intrinsic correlation between the luminosity and spectral type of a galaxy .",
    "observationally , early type galaxies tend to reside in clusters of galaxies whereas later type galaxies are more often found in the field .",
    "we would expect , therefore , that early type galaxy samples would have more small separation pairs than samples selected for late type galaxies and that their resulting correlation functions would be steeper .",
    "this is consistent with the data except that we would expect there to be a smooth transition from early to late type galaxies and that the correlation function slope should smoothly change from a steep value of @xmath129 for the early types to the more shallow value of @xmath130 for the late types . what we observe",
    ", however , is that red galaxies ( types @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) have a common slope of @xmath131 and blue galaxies ( types @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) have a slope of @xmath132 ( i.e.  there does not appear to be a smooth transition ) .",
    "we can , however , explain this behavior if we consider a simple model for the distribution of galaxy types . from figure",
    "[ fig : typehist ] we see that the type histogram for the galaxies is almost bimodal @xcite with the distribution being well fit by two gaussians . for simplicity",
    "we will denote these subclasses as `` red '' and `` blue '' .",
    "if the `` red '' and `` blue '' populations have distinct correlation functions ( i.e.  with different slopes ) , then any observed correlation function should simply come from mixing these populations .",
    "as we change the mix of `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies then the resulting slope of the correlation function will also change .",
    "this is exactly what we observe with the correlation function as we move from the @xmath44 to @xmath45 selections .",
    "if we selected galaxies only from either the `` red '' or `` blue '' sub - populations we would expect no change in the correlation function slope as all of the `` red '' or `` blue '' galaxies have a common correlation function .",
    "again , this what we observe from the data .",
    "the slopes of the correlation functions for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 red samples are identical as are the correlation functions for the blue @xmath45 and @xmath46 samples . in reality",
    ", the color selection that we applied to the sdss data ( types @xmath43 through @xmath46 ) was not chosen to optimally separate two distinct populations of galaxies but rather to provide a simple subdivision of galaxies based on the cww spectral energy distributions .",
    "we might expect there to remain some population mixing in our @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 color cuts .",
    "we observe this effect where the amplitude of the correlation function for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 classes are close but not identical ; this would imply that the @xmath45 still contains a subset of the `` red '' galaxies .",
    "the luminosity dependence can be explained if we note that the luminosity functions of the `` red '' and `` blue '' classes are identical for magnitudes brighter than @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "they deviate only for the faint end of the luminosity function ( `` blue '' galaxies having a steeper faint end slope ) . varying the luminosity cuts should not change the mix of the galaxy populations ( unless we sample galaxies with @xmath134 ) .",
    "we would , therefore , expect the shape of the correlation function to be independent of the luminosity cuts ( as is found from the data ) .",
    "given this hypothesis if we selected a volume limited sample for galaxies with luminosities less that @xmath133 we would expect to find a dependence on the slope with luminosity .",
    "it is , therefore , remarkable that with such a simple model for the distribution of galaxies ( i.e.  just two classes with differing correlation functions ) we can qualitatively describe the behavior of the correlation functions with color and luminosity .",
    "what is difficult to understand is why there would be a simple scaling of the amplitude of the correlation function with intrinsic luminosity as the spatial scales we sample are in the non - linear regime ( i.e.  a simple linear bias model is not necessarily appropriate ) .",
    "identifying the physical mechanism that could give rise to the luminosity and type dependent bias that we observe remains an open question .",
