    "the quest for an understanding of grb and afterglow physics , as well as the parameters that characterize the burst has recently led us to a new approach to the modelling of afterglow data . in principle , by modelling the afterglow data it is possible to extract the five parameters characterizing the synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) from which we can calculate the burst energy , the ambient medium density , and the fractions of energy in the magnetic fields and electrons  @xcite . at the same time , with accurate modelling it is possible to distinguish between the different models of afterglow emission , i.e. ism vs. wind , and spherical vs. collimated outflow  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of afterglow emission from grbs in the late 1990s , the general approach to afterglow modelling has consisted of the following steps  @xcite .",
    "the data set collected for a particular burst was broken up into lightcurves and spectra , which were fitted separately .",
    "the spectra were modelled using the broken synchrotron spectrum in order to extract the value of @xmath3 , and possibly the break frequencies .",
    "the lightcurves were each fitted separately to solve for the temporal decay slopes , @xmath5 , which were then compared for consistency , and in the optical band to extract any host galaxy extinction .",
    "the temporal decay slopes were also used to distinguish between the different models of afterglow emission , and breaks were used to infer the existence of a jet geometry .",
    "this approach has several serious drawbacks :    * only a few data points are modelled at a time , and the uncertainty in the derived parameters is large .",
    "* the deduced model parameters and power - law indices are not always physically meaningful ( e.g. can give @xmath6 ) . *",
    "since this approach employs the broken synchrotron power - law , the modelling of lightcurves and spectra near the break frequencies is inaccurate . *",
    "it is extremely difficult to account for the changes in the spectrum and time dependences when the order of the break frequencies changes .",
    "our approach attempts to remedy the aforementioned problems , and in addition to clearly identify the present shortcomings of afterglow studies .",
    "the procedure we use in modelling the data is significantly different .",
    "we use a broad - band data set ranging from radio to x - rays and fit it simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "we therefore give equal weight to all data points , and do not disregard scattered data points , which in the traditional approach are useless .",
    "our approach also tests a complete model with all its different early and late time variations , including the transition to the sub - relativistic phase .",
    "it is therefore self - consistent since it does not include or exclude any assumptions and constraints that are part of the complete model . with this approach",
    "we gain the following advantages :    * all data points are used simultaneously since the model includes both the temporal and frequency dependence of each parameter .",
    "* we use the granot , piran and sari smoothed synchrotron spectrum  @xcite  @xcite , which is a much more accurate and realistic representation of the actual data .",
    "* we can easily include all special cases of the spectral and temporal evolution ; therefore , any significant deviation of the data from the predicted models can be interpreted as a possibly new phenomenon ( e.g. grb000301c  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "* we can easily extract the values of the burst energy , ambient density and fractions of energy in the magnetic fields and electrons .",
    "* we can directly determine which model ( e.g. ism vs. wind ) gives the most accurate description of the data using a simple @xmath7 statistic .",
    "the study of grb afterglows and the extraction of the burst characteristics from the observations can be severly limited if a narrow - band approach is used .",
    "the problems of this traditional approach to modelling are numerous , but they can be easily solved if a broad - band , self - consistent approach is used instead .",
    "we have shown that the overall behavior of the afterglow emission can be easily studied within this approach , that the correct emission model can be unambiguously identified if the data set is large enough , and that the parameters characterizing the burst ( e.g. energy , ambient density ) can be easily solved for ."
