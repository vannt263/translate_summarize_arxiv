    "discretizations are used in general relativity mainly in three contexts : a ) numerical relativity , b ) canonical quantum gravity , c ) path integral quantum gravity . in the first context",
    "the aim of discretizing the equations is to solve them on a computer numerically . in the second and third contexts the primary goal is to make finite the infinite dimensional computations implied by the field theory nature of general relativity ( and eventually to solve the theory numerically on a computer ) .",
    "it has long been known in numerical relativity that the set of algebraic equations that results of discretizing the einstein equations ( for instance , with externally prescribed lapse and shift ) is _ inconsistent _ in the following sense .",
    "the discretized evolution equations produce solutions in the future that do not satisfy the discretized constraints , even if one started from initial data that satisfied them .",
    "the general attitude towards this problem in numerical relativity has been that the aim is to provide an approximate description of the continuum theory and therefore the inconsistency is accepted as part of the errors of the approximation scheme .",
    "this was clearly discussed by choptuik @xcite , who showed that the constraints were preserved at the same order of discretization as the evolution equations .    in canonical and path integral quantum gravity",
    ", the potential inconsistency of the discretized theories has not received a lot of emphasis .",
    "it was noted by bander @xcite in general and later by friedman and jack @xcite in the context of regge calculus that it was not straightforward to find consistent hamiltonian formulations of general relativity discretized in space and with continuum time .",
    "it has generally been recognized that a problem has to arise in lattice treatments of general relativity since , unlike the case of yang ",
    "mills theory , the introduction of a lattice breaks the `` gauge symmetry '' of the theory ( invariance under diffeomorphisms ) . in spite of these observations ,",
    "the remarkable formulation of a well defined hamiltonian constraint for quantum general relativity due to thiemann @xcite starts with a discretization of the theory .",
    "thiemann promotes the hamiltonian constraint to a quantum operator acting on the space of solutions of the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "this somewhat obscures the issue of the implementation of the constraint algebra , since on such space the algebra of constraints is abelian .",
    "it has been noted , however , that it is likely that problems are implicit in the quantization with respect to the closure of the constraint algebra @xcite `` off - shell '' ( on non - diffeomorphism invariant states ) .",
    "proposals to construct quantizations of the hamiltonian that produce non - abelian operators have failed to yield quantities that reproduce the proper constraint algebra @xcite .    in canonical formulations ,",
    "the role of the constraints is to generate infinitesimal symmetries . in a discrete theory ,",
    "the best we could hope for is that the constraints generate some finite version of the symmetry in question .",
    "obviously , such an action can not be achieved with a discretization of the continuum constraints , since the latter generate infinitesimal symmetries .",
    "the continuum constraints therefore naturally structure themselves into algebras .",
    "the discrete generators of symmetries that one could have in a discrete theory will not structure themselves in an algebra .",
    "therefore there is no sense in which one will have in the discrete theory an algebra of constraints that `` in the limit '' reproduces the continuum algebra .",
    "an additional element is that discrete symmetries are not characterized by free parameters , as infinitesimal symmetries are .",
    "a discrete transformation can only admit a set of fixed values for the parameters of the transformation .",
    "therefore in dealing with finite symmetries the finite quantities that are remnants of the lagrange multipliers of the continuum theory become fixed .",
    "this inevitably leads us to systems of constraints of second class in the canonical treatment .",
    "finally , one has a choice as to the role of time .",
    "one could try to discretize `` space '' and leave `` time '' continuous .",
    "this is highly unnatural in general relativity and might further complicate the issues of the constraint algebra since the latter mixes symmetries in space and time . in this paper",
    "we will choose to pick a discrete time in the theories we consider .",
    "this is more symmetric and allows for a better connection with `` spin - foam '' approaches in which time is discrete .    having a discrete canonical formulation for general relativity is , in our opinion , fundamental at the time of understanding current `` spin - foam '' approaches to the path integral of quantum general relativity .",
    "it is well known that path integrals for gauge field theories should be evaluated with care in order to avoid integrating over the orbits of the gauge groups .",
    "this is at the core of the fadeev ",
    "popov technique and can only be fully understood if one understands the degrees of freedom of the theory at a hamiltonian level @xcite . to achieve this for discrete gravity",
    "is one of the goals we are pursuing .",
    "an additional point to consider is that most lattice treatments of gauge theories require an euclidean rotation in order to be well defined .",
    "this is expected to be problematic in the case of general relativity .",
    "the formalism we will present in this paper does not require an euclidean rotation and operates directly in terms of the lorentzian signature theory .",
    "the lack of a lorentzian formulation on the lattice has been recognized as one of the major unsolved issues in lattice formulations of gravity @xcite    the inconsistencies that arise in discretizations are present in spin foam approaches directly .",
    "when one discretizes the action in order to compute the path integral one is left with a discrete action whose equations of motion are seldom analyzed and in general yield an inconsistent theory .",
    "if one therefore computes the integral for the discrete theory , one is attempting a functional integration for a theory that does not exist .",
    "one will get a result , but there will generically be no way of making a connection with the underlying classical theory .    a point to consider is if one could not simply adopt in the quantum context the same attitude as was adopted in numerical relativity .",
    "could one deal with inconsistent discrete theories that are just approximations of a consistent theory that exists in the limit ?",
    "this would be a point of view that is tenable if one had a well defined way of taking the limit in which discretizations are infinitely refined .",
    "this is not currently available for general relativity and it is generally thought that such limit will be highly non - trivial given the non - renormalizability of the theory .",
    "current thinking favors viewing the discrete theory as existing at a fundamental level and never taking the limit ( see for instance @xcite . in such a case",
    "one needs to take the issue of consistency of such a theory seriously . even if one wished to consider some sort of `` continuum limit '' ( for instance summing over all possible discretizations ) , it is our belief that one has a better chance of defining such a limit if one is obtaining it in a process where one considers a sequence of well defined , consistent , theories .    in this paper",
    "we would like to discuss the canonical treatment of discrete systems .",
    "the subject is quite non - trivial .",
    "up to this paper the state of the art of the subject was such that even the treatment of simple mechanical systems with constraints was incomplete .",
    "in particular , the literature only covers systems with constraints that are holonomic ( function of half of the variables of the phase space ) . in this paper",
    "we extend the canonical formulation to include arbitrary constrained mechanical systems .",
    "a key new ingredient is to introduce a symplectic structure on the lattice based on discrete canonical transformations that implement the discrete time evolution .",
    "we then turn our attention to the treatment of gauge field theories on the lattice . to our knowledge , this is the first time that a complete canonical analysis of gauge field theories discretized on the lattice is presented , in the sense that we discretize the action of the theory and derive the canonical theory from the discrete action .",
    "the final results for maxwell and yang  mills theories on the lattice coincides with the traditional transfer matrix methods , but the intermediate steps are quite non - trivial",
    ". we also present a canonical treatment of bf theory on the lattice . in this case , up to present no lattice treatment was present at all in the literature .",
    "the formulation we construct is readily applicable to the case of general relativity , which we will discuss in a separate publication .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the quantization of mechanical systems with discrete time evolution . in section iii",
    "we extend the analysis to lattice yang  mills theory . in section",
    "iv we discuss discretized bf theory .",
    "we end with a discussion of implications for quantum gravity .",
    "some of the difficulties of constructing hamiltonian formulations for discrete theories can be illustrated with the simplest mechanical systems if we assume time is a discrete variable .",
    "the subject of `` discrete mechanics '' has been considered several times in the literature .",
    "the broad subject of `` symplectic integrators '' also touches upon these issues .",
    "however , all discussions we have found in the literature refer to systems with holonomic constraints , for reasons that will soon become apparent @xcite . here",
    "we will present a a discussion that includes anholonomic constraints , as the ones in gravity .",
    "discretizing time in mechanics immediately leads to difficulties with conservation laws .",
    "let us start by considering the action of a particle of unit mass in a potential , written in a discrete approximation in which time is split into intervals of duration @xmath0 , @xmath1\\epsilon.\\ ] ] if we work out the equations of motion of this action , one gets , @xmath2 one immediately recognizes a discrete approximation to hamilton s equation .",
    "there is an asymmetry in the equations in the sense that the discretization of the time derivative of @xmath3 is `` centered '' between @xmath4 and @xmath5 whereas the one in @xmath6 is centered between @xmath7 and @xmath4 .",
    "this theory recovers in the continuum limit the usual classical mechanics of a particle in a potential .",
    "however , it is well known that in the discrete theory , energy is not conserved .",
    "it is immediate to realize that similar problems will arise in constrained systems : the discrete evolution equations will fail to preserve the constraints , at least if they are anholonomic .    a first attempt to solve the problem of non - conservation is due to t.d . lee @xcite .",
    "his proposal consists in `` parameterizing '' the system by including the time interval as a new variable .",
    "the action can therefore be written as , @xmath8 and we consider as variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "when one varies with respect to @xmath10 one immediately gets that @xmath11 .",
    "this equation , with the two other equations of motion determine @xmath12 and @xmath10 , that is , the time interval is now determined by the equations of motion .",
    "s construction merits several comments .",
    "first , notice that the use of the parameterization immediately suggests how to handle the problem of non preservation of constraints in general relativity .",
    "the idea is to consider the einstein evolution equations together with the constraints as equations for the metric , extrinsic curvature _ and _ the lagrange multipliers ( the lapse and shift ) .",
    "one has therefore four additional equations ( the constraints ) and four additional variables .",
    "one can therefore construct a discrete system of equations that preserves the constraints in time .",
    "we are currently studying the feasibility of implementing this scheme in a numerical simulation of spherically symmetric space - times .",
    "there has been considerable discussion in the literature on constructing quantities that are kept invariant by the evolution implied by the discretized evolution equations .",
    "maeda @xcite constructed a modified noether theorem .",
    "logan @xcite proposed a method for constructing invariants not associated with symmetries of the action .",
    "jaroszkiewicz and norton @xcite discussed the quantization of systems by constructing evolution operators .",
    "a whole separate chapter could be devoted to the subject of `` symplectic integrators '' @xcite .",
    "the focus of this area of research is usually numerical .",
    "people have noticed for a long time that it is desirable for discretization of dynamical equations to preserve certain conserved quantities of the classical theory .",
    "in particular the symplectic structure , or , as in the case of celestial dynamics , angular momentum and energy @xcite . this is a highly developed area of research , in which canonical techniques have been widely used in the treatment of discrete systems .",
    "in fact , our current paper can be viewed as an extension of certain symplectic integration results to the realm of constrained systems , with an eye towards application to general relativity .",
    "the classical canonical treatment of discrete systems has been considered in the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the usual treatment considers unconstrained systems and implements time evolution through canonical transformations of type 2 @xcite .",
    "the discrete evolution produces time histories of the variables . in the continuum limit",
    ", some of these evolutions ( the ones with good continuum limit ) will be solutions of the continuum equations of motion .",
    "since we are interested in constrained systems , we will find that it is more convenient to work with canonical transformations of type 1 .",
    "we start by denoting @xmath13 the lagrangian of the continuum theory .",
    "we discretize time in equal intervals @xmath14 and we label the generalized coordinates evaluated at time @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "we define the `` discretized '' lagrangian as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 the action can then be written as , @xmath19 and its lagrange equations of motion , @xmath20 as can be seen , in the discrete theory the lagrangian is not a function of the manifold of @xmath3 s and its tangent bundle @xmath21 , but it is a function of @xmath16 at the @xmath22 level and of @xmath23 at the next level ( or equivalently @xmath16 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "we now wish to introduce canonically conjugate momenta and show how the discrete evolution can be represented as a canonical transformation in phase space .",
    "the partial derivatives of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are related by , @xmath27    in the continuum , the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath3 is defined as @xmath28 and due to ( [ der1 ] ) we define the canonically conjugate momentum in the discrete theory as @xmath29    the lagrange equations in the continuum can be written as , @xmath30 with @xmath6 defined as in ( [ pcontinuo ] ) . to discretize this last expression we make the substitution @xmath31 and use ( [ der1 ] ) , ( [ der2 ] ) and ( [ p1 ] ) to get @xmath32 = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\left [ \\frac{\\partial l(n , n+1)}{\\partial q_{n+1 } }   + \\frac{\\partial l(n , n+1)}{\\partial q_n}\\right ] = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\left [ p_{n+1 }   + \\frac{\\partial l(n , n+1)}{\\partial q_n}\\right],\\ ] ] then @xmath33 summarizing , the discrete lagrange equations are , @xmath34 and it should be noted that these equations define a type 1 canonical transformation from the variables @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the variables @xmath35 constitute a phase space and as usual , if the system of equations ( [ 15 ] ) is non - singular one can introduce new coordinates @xmath36 for the phase space .",
    "this transformation is canonical , in the sense that it preserves the symplectic structure , @xmath37    the generating function ( we use the terminology of @xcite ) for the transformation is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is given by inverting the first of ( [ 15 ] ) ; it is immediate to check that it satisfies the equations of a generating function , @xmath40    one can now introduce the generating functions of canonical transformations of the various types that correspond to discrete time evolution . if the variables @xmath41 are used for coordinates of the phase space , then one can introduce a generating function of type 1 , @xmath42    it is then possible to define generating functions of type 2,3 and 4 .",
    "for instance , if the phase space is coordinatized by @xmath43 , solving the first of ( [ 15 ] ) for @xmath23 one can introduce a generating function of type 2 , @xmath44    to facilitate the comparison with the continuum limit case , we can introduce a function @xmath45 given by , @xmath46 such that one recovers the discrete hamilton equations , @xmath47    the quantization of these finite canonical systems is achieved by representing the finite canonical transformations that materialize the time evolution as unitary operators .",
    "we illustrate this with a simple example , a particle in a potential .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath48 the canonical momentum is given by @xmath49 , from which we can get @xmath50 .",
    "the generating function is given by , @xmath51 and the equations of motion ( taking into account ( [ 12],[13 ] ) ) are @xmath52 which can be solved for @xmath53 as , @xmath54    we now proceed to quantize the system .",
    "we choose a polarization such that the wavefunctions are functions of the configuration variables , @xmath55 .",
    "the canonical operators have the usual form .",
    "the evolution of the system is implemented via a unitary transformation .",
    "an immediate computation shows that the operator that implements the transformation @xmath56 , @xmath57 is given by , @xmath58    at a quantum mechanical level the energy @xmath59 is not conserved , as we expected from the fact that it was not conserved classically .",
    "it is remarkable however , that one can construct an `` energy '' ( both at a quantum mechanical and classical level ) that is conserved by the discrete evolution . to construct this energy we use the baker ",
    "hausdorff formula , @xmath60 + { 1 \\over 12}\\left(\\left[x,\\left[x , y\\right]\\right]+ \\left[y,\\left[y , x\\right]\\right]\\right)+\\ldots\\right),\\ ] ] and one can therefore write @xmath61 where @xmath62 , which is immediately conserved under evolution .",
    "it is straightforward to write down a classical counterpart of this expression .",
    "we now extend the analysis of the previous subsection to the case of a constrained system . here",
    "it will become clear the advantage of using canonical transformations of type 1 .",
    "we start with an action written in first order form , @xmath63 where we assume we have @xmath64 constraints @xmath65 .",
    "we now exhibit the construction of a type 1 canonical transformation .",
    "we construct the appropriate canonically conjugate momenta using the first of ( [ 15 ] ) , @xmath66    to determine the equations of motion for the system we start from the second set of equations ( [ 15 ] ) , @xmath67    combining the last two sets of equations we get the equations of motion for the system , @xmath68    superficially , these equations appear entirely equivalent to the continuum ones",
    ". however , they hide the fact that in order for the constraints to be preserved , the lagrange multipliers get fixed . another way to see it ,",
    "is that @xmath69 and therefore it is immediate that the poisson bracket of the constraints evaluated at @xmath70 and at @xmath71 is non - vanishing .",
    "we then consider the constraint equation ( [ 45 ] ) and substitute @xmath72 by ( [ 37 ] ) , @xmath73 we then solve ( [ 44 ] ) for @xmath16 and substitute it in the previous equation , one gets , @xmath74 and this constitutes a system of equations .",
    "generically , these will determine @xmath75 where the @xmath76 are a set of free parameters that may arise if the system of equations is undetermined .",
    "the eventual presence of these parameters will signify that the resulting theory still has a genuine gauge freedom represented by freely specifiable lagrange multipliers .",
    "the final set of evolution equations for the system is therefore given by ( [ 43],[44 ] ) where the lagrange multipliers are substituted using ( [ lambdadet ] ) .",
    "at this point it is worthwhile discussing the physical meaning of the determination of the value of the lagrange multipliers .",
    "this is an issue that is potentially confusing .",
    "lagrange multipliers are normally associated with gauge symmetries .",
    "the fixation of the value of the lagrange multipliers seems to suggest that the constructive procedure of the discrete theory somehow has selected a preferred gauge for us . a priori this might appear very unnatural .",
    "how could the procedure know which gauge to choose ?",
    "a point to emphasize is that in this section we have absorbed in the definition of the lagrange multipliers a factor of @xmath0 ( the evolution parameter interval ) when we replaced the integral of the action by a discrete sum .",
    "what gets determined is therefore `` @xmath77 '' . for a completely parameterized theory , since there is no explicit reference to @xmath0 , one can choose it arbitrarily and therefore redefine the value of the multiplier arbitrarily . a different way of putting this , which might help later understand the situation in general relativity , is to consider that once the lattice has been established , the gauge is fixed , but one has still the freedom of where to place the lattice in an arbitrary manner .",
    "having set up the canonical quantization of mechanical systems discretized in time , we now turn our attention to field theories . in this case",
    "we also wish to discretize space .",
    "although the words `` hamiltonian formulation '' are used frequently in the lattice context , the formulation is not constructed in the traditional canonical sense .",
    "a popular way of obtaining a hamiltonian operator for quantized lattice gauge theory is the `` transfer matrix '' method .",
    "this consists in discretizing the space - time action and reading off from the path integral the operator that would correspond to the infinitesimal evolution operator in the limit in which the spacing in time goes to zero .",
    "there is no construction of a classical discrete theory that is later quantized .",
    "even the definition of canonical variables for such a classical theory is problematic and has received some attention @xcite .",
    "what we will do in this paper is precisely that : we will construct a classical canonical discrete lattice theory for yang ",
    "mills , that we will quantize and we will show that we recover the same results as those of the usual transfer matrix approach .    we will first explore the construction of yang ",
    "mills lattice theory with a continuum time parameter .",
    "although we know that ultimately this is not what we want , since as we argued it is unlikely a formulation like this will be useful in the gravitational case , it will prove instructive for later constructing a theory discretized in space and time .",
    "we will then consider the quantization of maxwell theory on a discrete space - time .",
    "maxwell s theory has all the ingredients of interest and is simpler than yang  mills theory .",
    "we consider a hypercubic lattice in four dimensions with spatial spacing @xmath78 and spacing in time @xmath79 .",
    "we label the vertices of the hypercube with an integer @xmath4 .",
    "each link connecting two sites is identified as a pair @xmath80 . associated with each ( oriented )",
    "link there is a holonomy @xmath81 , we shall assume for simplicity that it takes value in @xmath82 .",
    "the holonomy of the link traversed in the opposite direction is given by the inverse @xmath83 .",
    "the wilson action is given by , @xmath84 where the sum is over all elementary plaquettes @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the area of the plaquettes .",
    "@xmath87 is @xmath88 if the plaquette is spatial and @xmath89 if it is timelike .",
    "notice that we are considering the lorentzian action , our treatment does not require a wick rotation to the euclidean action .",
    "we now will take the limit in which the spacing in the time direction , @xmath79 goes to zero . in order to do this we will relabel the links with two indices @xmath90 where the index @xmath70 labels the position of the vertex `` in time '' and the index @xmath91 runs through all the oriented links that form the spatial sub - lattice @xmath92 at a given time @xmath70 .",
    "we denote by @xmath93 and @xmath94 the vertices at the origin and end of the link @xmath91 .",
    "we rewrite the action and we make explicit the elementary plaquettes that are completely spatial and those that have temporal links , @xmath95   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where holonomies along timelike links are denoted by the spatial label of the vertex they start and end at , and the time level they start at , like @xmath96 . the second term in the lagrangian",
    "is a sum over all spatial elementary plaquettes at time @xmath70 , @xmath97 .",
    "we introduced the following notation for the components of the holonomy , @xmath98 where @xmath99 are real , the @xmath100 are given by @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the pauli matrices .",
    "we will now take the limit in which @xmath104 .",
    "the holonomies along the timelike direction become , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is any vertex of @xmath92 and @xmath107 with @xmath108 real .",
    "we will use as generalized coordinates the variables @xmath109 and @xmath110 , normalizing the lagrangian in such a way that @xmath111    the lagrangian therefore becomes , @xmath112   \\nonumber\\\\ & & + { 1 \\over 2a }   \\sum_{p } { \\rm tr}\\left(u_{p}\\right ) + { a^3 } \\sum_{l } \\alpha_{l}\\sum_{i=0}^3 \\left [ \\left(u_{l}^i\\right)^2 -2\\right]\\label{70}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have dropped the subscript @xmath70 since all variables are now evaluated on the same time slice .",
    "the above sum goes over all links traversed only once in a given direction and @xmath113 .",
    "we have also included an additional term in the lagrangian , which is a constraint that fixes the holonomies to take values in @xmath82 provided the @xmath110 s are real .",
    "it can be seen that the discrete lagrange equations of motion coming from this lagrangian lead , in the limit @xmath114 to yang  mills equations .",
    "the discretization in this case does not break any gauge symmetry and therefore the discretized theory is automatically consistent .",
    "we now proceed to work out the canonically conjugate momenta , @xmath115    performing the legendre transform , the hamiltonian becomes , @xmath116 -{1 \\over 2a }   \\sum_{p_n } { \\rm tr}\\left(u_{p_n}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & - { a^3 } \\sum_{l } \\alpha_{l } \\sum_{i=0}^3\\left [ \\left(u_{l}^i\\right)^2 -2\\right ] + \\sum_{|l|\\in l_n } \\rho_{l } \\pi^\\alpha_{l } + \\sum_v \\sum_{a=1}^3 \\mu_{va } \\left(\\pi^\\lambda_v\\right)^a\\label{74}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "we now need to ensure that the evolution preserves the constraints .",
    "ensuring the conservation of ( [ vin1 ] ) leads to @xmath119=0 \\label{vin3}\\ ] ] and conservation of ( [ vin2 ] ) leads to gauss law , as we will soon discuss .",
    "we now need to ensure the conservation of ( [ vin3 ] ) and of gauss law .",
    "conservation of ( [ vin3 ] ) leads to @xmath120 this implies that the product @xmath121 is an element of the @xmath122 algebra and is purely imaginary . to understand this",
    ", we need to notice two properties .",
    "first of all , the object @xmath123 transforms under gauge transformations as a gauge vector at the point @xmath93 .",
    "the second property is that gauss law can be rewritten as , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a smearing function .",
    "this is the usual expression of gauss law in lattice gauge theory , and shows that the quantity @xmath126 plays the role of an electric field , and the gauss law just states that the outgoing flux of electric field lines from point @xmath4 vanishes .",
    "conservation of gauss law is guaranteed , since the action is gauge invariant , but it can be explicitly verified .",
    "we still need to conserve in time the constraint that states that @xmath126 is a purely imaginary element of the algebra .",
    "the resulting equation determines the lagrange multiplier @xmath127 .",
    "the fact that the lagrange multiplier is zero implies that there will be second class constraints .",
    "indeed , constraints ( [ vin3],[vin4 ] ) are second class .    to handle the second class constraints we can introduce dirac brackets .",
    "the dirac brackets become , @xmath128 this relationship was derived , via an independent constructive method by renteln and smolin @xcite . based on this dirac bracket",
    "one can work out the dirac brackets of the electric field with the holonomy and with itself and one recovers the usual brackets that people assume in lattice gauge theory and that approximate in the limit @xmath114 the poisson bracket in the continuum of the electric field with a holonomy .",
    "we now proceed to write the dirac extended hamiltonian , which is achieved by imposing strongly the second class constraints and adding the first class secondary constraints we found .",
    "performing the sum , we get , @xmath129    and we see we recover the well known hamiltonian of yang  mills theory on a lattice .",
    "this example is revealing in that if we had simply taken equation ( [ 70 ] ) and attempted a direct quantization ignoring the fact that there were second class constraints it would have been very difficult to reproduce the usual yang ",
    "mills hamiltonian in the lattice .",
    "all attempts to quantize the hamiltonian constraint of general relativity have ignored the complex canonical structure of the discrete hamiltonian being quantized . to address this issue",
    "is the main point of our approach .",
    "this example also exhibits how treating time as a continuum variable while discretizing in space yields a complicated canonical structure for the resulting theory . in the case of general relativity",
    "it would be expected that complications will be even greater , since the constraint algebra intimately ties space and time . we will therefore from now on only discuss field theories in which both space and time are discretized .",
    "we start by considering the example of maxwell theory .      as in the case of yang ",
    "mills we start by writing the wilson action , particularized to the case of a @xmath130 connection , @xmath131 where as before @xmath92 es the spatial sub - lattice at a given time @xmath70 and we label the links with @xmath91 , the vertices with @xmath106 and the plaquettes with @xmath72 .",
    "the sum @xmath132 goes over all links traversed only once in a given direction .",

    "the framework we have set up is completely ready to be applied to the case of general relativity , which will have many similarities with the bf case .",
