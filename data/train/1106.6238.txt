    "after the advent of the brane world scenario @xcite and the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , there has been an increase in interest in the study of higher - dimensional black holes .",
    "the kerr metric was first generalized to higher dimensions in the seminal paper by myers and perry @xcite .",
    "one of the unexpected results is that for some rotating black holes event horizons exist for arbitrarily large values of the rotation parameters .",
    "the stability of such black holes are certainly in question  @xcite . these are asymptotically flat black holes .",
    "the first asymptotically non - flat higher - dimensional kerr metric was given by hawking _",
    "et al_.  @xcite for five dimensions .",
    "subsequent generalizations to arbitrary dimensions were done by gibbons _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , finally resulting in the most general kerr-(a)ds - nut metric by chen , l and pope  @xcite .",
    "the study of the wave equations in these black hole spacetimes was initiated by frolov and stojkovic  @xcite by analyzing the klein - gordon equation in five dimensions .",
    "the analysis relied crucially on the method of the separation of variables .",
    "the problem of separability of these wave equations in higher dimensions is a difficult one . even for the klein - gordon case ,",
    "early attempts were only aimed at special cases  @xcite . finally , using the chen - l - pope metric , frolov , krtous and kubiznak  @xcite were able to separate the geodesic equation and the klein - gordon equation in the most general setting .    however , the research on the scalar wave equation so far is focused mostly on the case with one rotation , the so - called simply - rotating case .",
    "notably , the stability of the scalar perturbation in six and higher dimensions was considered in the ultra - rotating cases  @xcite . apparently no instability was found .",
    "then , due to the interests in ads spacetimes , these considerations were extended to kerr - ads black holes  @xcite . here",
    "the expected superradiant instability did indeed show up .",
    "in addition the hawking radiation in these spacetimes  @xcite are calculated with possible application to the production and decay of lhc black holes  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to explore the cases with two rotations . in the next section we present the general metric of the kerr-(a)ds black hole with two rotations .",
    "the corresponding klein - gordon equation will be separated into one radial equation and two angular ones . in section 3 , we shall develop perturbative expansions of the angular eigenvalues in powers of the rotation parameters .",
    "conclusions and discussions are given in section 4 .",
    "in this section we shall first present the kerr-(a)ds metric with two rotations .",
    "we start with the metric for @xmath1 , that is , for even dimensions",
    ". however , the result we obtain in the end should also be valid for odd dimensional cases . for @xmath1 , there are at most @xmath2 rotation directions so we have @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
