    "the fast survey capabilities of next - generation radio telescopes such as the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the low frequency array ( lofar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) greatly facilitate the study of transient and variable radio sources .",
    "the primary observables in such surveys are sky positions and flux densities , while secondary observables may include angular source sizes and shapes , polarisation fractions , polarisation vectors and rotation measures .",
    "many astrophysical phenomena , including gamma - ray bursts , stellar flares , pulsars , exoplanets , black hole jet launches , supernovae and fast radio bursts produce transient and variable radio emission on a wide range of time scales , from milliseconds to days .",
    "locating and identifying the progenitors of these events has been the focus of many recent blind surveys making use of new low - frequency telescopes @xcite and also upcoming surveys at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "given the high data rate from these new instruments @xcite , the extraction , cross - matching , light - curve generation and classification of sources must be conducted in an automated fashion @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of these automated pipelines is that major sources of error and extrinsic / foreground variability are understood and accounted for to prevent source misclassifications .",
    "the recent discovery of radio emission from fireballs @xcite exemplifies a previously unknown terrestrial source of transient radio emission that may confuse searches for celestial transients .",
    "one important contributor to extrinsic variability , especially at frequencies less than @xmath11ghz , is the distortion of phase fronts due to propagation through the earth s ionosphere .",
    "the ionosphere is the ionised component of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "it extends between altitudes of roughly 501000 km , with the electron density peaking near 300400 km altitude at night @xcite . at low radio frequencies ,",
    "spatially - varying electron densities in the ionosphere induce variations in the angular position and flux density of radio sources through refraction and diffraction of propagating radio waves @xcite .",
    "position shifts can diminish the accuracy of cross - matching between different epochs of observation , and propagation - induced amplitude variability can result in celestial source misclassifications . smearing and",
    "angular broadening can cause otherwise point - like sources to become distorted , and this can pose difficulties for deconvolution and source identification / extraction . quantifying these effects",
    "is important both for the design and optimisation of algorithms that remove ionospheric distortions from the data @xcite , and also to obtain realistic error bars on observables for time - domain astrophysics ( cf .",
    "a number of studies have been aimed at quantifying the effects of the ionosphere on radio astronomical observations at low radio frequencies .",
    "these include the theoretical work of @xcite and @xcite , and observational work with the nanay radio interferometer @xcite , the westerbork radio synthesis telescope @xcite , the los alamos radio interferometer @xcite , and the very large array ( vla ) radio interferometer @xcite .",
    "these have established that radio telescopes are highly sensitive to and can even be used to characterise ionospheric perturbations and irregularities ordinarily studied through other means , by isolating propagation - induced fluctuations in the amplitudes , phases and angular positions of radio sources .",
    "the effects of electron density fluctuations occurring on timescales of several minutes and with spatial scales of @xmath110 km have been observed in interferometric data .",
    "this is important because the characteristic spatiotemporal scales of ionospheric behaviour determine the spatiotemporal scales on which calibration is required , and ultimately the precision to which astronomical observables can be measured @xcite .",
    "the types and occurrence rates of ionospheric fluctuations depend on geographic location , tropospheric weather and geomagnetic conditions @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite has explored the possibility of using global positioning system ( gps ) satellite measurements to calibrate for ionospheric effects in radio interferometric data .",
    "however , the existence of a substantial population of irregularities on length scales below the resolution of global gps maps ( @xmath1100 km ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that gps measurements alone can not fully predict the extent to which the ionosphere affects radio observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the coherence properties of ionospheric irregularities of a given scale size depend on the configuration of the array , with decoherence and scintillation effects more severe on longer baselines @xcite .",
    "although general statements can be made based on physical arguments and established knowledge ( see  [ sec : effects ] ) , a direct examination of the data is the most straightforward means of assessing the severity of ionospheric effects for a given radio interferometer and geographical site .",
    "this work aims to empirically establish the effects of the ionosphere on radio astronomy conducted with the mwa , focusing on its impacts on time - domain science , for which the two most important observables are angular position and flux density .",
    "we directly examine the statistics of those observables in 10 nights of data collected as part of the mwa transients survey ( mwats ; pi : m.  e.  bell ) , a general - purpose , low - frequency ( 154mhz ) radio survey looking for transient and variable sources .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : effects ] with an overview of how the ionosphere affects radio interferometric measurements .",
    "we describe our observations and analysis approach in  [ sec : obs ] , and present the results in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we interpret the results and discuss their implications in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "angular broadening and shape distortion effects are not considered here , although they may diminish the performance of astronomical source - finding algorithms ( by making the source more difficult to identify , or increasing the measurement error in flux density and/or position ) . as argued in  [ sec : overviewposition ] , distortion and broadening effects are expected to be secondary to angular position shifts of whole sources , given the compact physical size of the mwa , for sufficiently short integrations .",
    "electron densities in the ionosphere are commonly described in terms of the total electron content ( tec ; i.e.  the electron column density @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the local electron number density and @xmath4 parametrises distance along the line of sight ) , whose units are electronsm@xmath5 , commonly expressed in tec units ( tecu ; 1tecu @xmath6electronsm@xmath5 ) .",
    "radio waves from a given source arrive at the different receivers of an interferometer having traversed different paths through the ionosphere , acquiring different phase delays if the density is non - uniform .",
    "an initially planar set of wavefronts thus becomes distorted .",
    "this can cause the source to appear shifted from its true position , its peak amplitude to vary and/or its shape to distort @xcite .",
    "multi - path propagation through a highly irregular plasma can lead to self - interference of coherent phase fronts , causing a diffraction pattern to develop and giving rise to scintillation @xcite .",
    "phase delays associated with water vapour in the troposphere , although significant at high ( @xmath71ghz ) frequencies , are @xmath1100 times smaller than those of the ionosphere at the low frequencies of the mwa @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the aridity of the site ensures that tropospheric activity is relatively benign",
    ". the tropospheric contribution can therefore be largely ignored , and we consider only ionospheric effects here .      if the tec along the lines of sight from all receivers to a given source is the same , then the only effect ( ignoring those related to polarisation and frequency dispersion , which we do not consider here ) is to add a constant phase to all antennas .",
    "a constant absolute phase is not measurable by correlation interferometry , and so the recorded visibilities are identical to what they would be if there were no ionosphere .",
    "an angularly uniform tec screen therefore has no effect on radio observations ; distortions only arise from density inhomogeneities .    for radio waves propagating well above the local electron plasma frequency @xmath8 , the refractive index @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angular frequency of the radio waves , @xmath12 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron charge and mass .",
    "consider the lines of sight @xmath15 and @xmath16 from two separate interferometer elements to a given radio source , where the elements are spaced by a distance @xmath17 .",
    "the optical path difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 , then the wavefront appears to be tilted with respect to the original and this causes the apparent position of the source to shift @xcite .",
    "the phase difference between the antennas is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the observing frequency . in the small - angle approximation and",
    "assuming parallel lines of sight , the resulting angular shift in position is @xmath23 the negative sign in equation ( [ eq : posshift ] ) indicates that sources refract in the direction of decreasing tec .",
    "the @xmath24 dependence implies that for a given @xmath25 , the refractive shift is larger at lower frequencies .",
    "if the collection of sight lines from all antennas to a given source passes through a patch of the ionosphere whose tec distribution is well described by a linear ramp ( insignificant spatial curvature ) , then @xmath26 is linearly proportional to @xmath17 . equation ( [ eq : posshift ] ) then implies that @xmath27 will be the same on all baselines . substituting values for the various physical constants , this yields @xmath28 as the angular offset of the radio source in an image synthesised using the array , where @xmath27 is in radians",
    ", @xmath29 is in hz and @xmath30 ( the transverse gradient of the tec ) is in electronsm@xmath31 . at mid - latitudes where the mwa is sited , medium - scale travelling ionospheric disturbances ( tids ) driven by atmospheric waves",
    "are the most familiar type of wavelike perturbation @xcite .",
    "these have associated @xmath30 values of @xmath32@xmath33electronsm@xmath31 @xcite , which translates to @xmath34arcsec at @xmath29 = 154mhz .    as long as the length scales of the perturbation are much larger than the physical size of the array , irrespective of the field - of - view ( fov ) , and",
    "@xmath30 is roughly constant within an integration time , the perturbed wavefront remains approximately planar over the array and distortions are primarily in the form of angular position shifts with minimal changes to source shape or amplitude .",
    "the physical size of the mwa , which has a longest baseline of @xmath13 km ( comparable to the mean free path of neutral particles , o@xmath35 , o and he at the relevant altitudes . ] in the thermosphere ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is small compared to the wavelengths of tids , which can be 1001000 km @xcite .",
    "this suggests that neutral gas motions at ionospheric heights , including the atmospheric waves that drive tids , are locally expected to produce only simple position shifts of point sources in mwa images .",
    "however , the energy of these disturbances may potentially drive cascades of smaller - scale irregularities through various plasma instabilities @xcite .",
    "plasma turbulence occurring on scales below 3 km down to the ion gyroradius ( @xmath15 m in the thermosphere ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may produce higher - order wavefront perturbations over the mwa @xcite , leading to source broadening and shape distortions .      while position shifts are governed primarily by the first spatial derivative of the tec , scintillation and angular broadening effects",
    "are related to higher - order derivatives @xcite .",
    "the scattering and diffusion of ray paths upon propagation through an inhomogeneous medium causes focusing and defocusing of radio waves .",
    "curvature of an initially planar wavefront causes otherwise point - like sources to acquire a finite coherence length , leading to an increase in apparent width and a decrease in peak amplitude .",
    "temporal variations in the signal may come from intrinsic time variability in the plasma , and/or relative motion between the plasma and the lines of sight to celestial sources .",
    "this relative drift arises both from the rotation of the earth ( @xmath120ms@xmath36 drift of sight lines through the ionosphere at the latitude of the mwa , assuming an ionospheric altitude of 300 km ) , and also neutral winds causing the bulk plasma to drift at 10100ms@xmath36 with respect to the ground @xcite .",
    "small systematic deviations in flux density may also arise from absorption due to collisions between electrons and ions / neutrals , this being @xmath11% in the daytime and @xmath10.1% at night for typical mwa operating frequencies @xcite .",
    "for perturbations to the phase fronts by an amount less than @xmath11radian within a patch of some critical length @xmath37 , amplitude distortions are small ( fractional variations much less than unity ) .",
    "this is the regime of weak scintillation , inhabited by the ionosphere most of the time for frequencies around 100mhz @xcite .",
    "the timescale of amplitude variability is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the relative drift velocity between the ionosphere and the sight lines @xcite .",
    "the coherence length @xmath37 is given by the larger of either the baseline length or the fresnel scale @xmath40 , the latter of which describes the size of the region on the ionosphere from which huygen wavelets arrive at a point on the ground approximately in phase @xcite . here",
    "@xmath41 is the observing wavelength and @xmath42 is the altitude of the ionosphere .",
    "baseline lengths for the mwa ( several hundred metres ) are comparable to or below the fresnel scale at 154mhz ( @xmath11 km ) , implying a characteristic timescale of 10100s for amplitude variability due to the ionosphere .    if deflection angles are sufficiently large , rays from a given celestial source intersect before they reach the ground , producing a fully - developed fraunhofer diffraction pattern that gives rise to large and rapid amplitude fluctuations ( fractional variations of order unity ) .",
    "this regime is known as strong scintillation , and occurs when there are significant phase fluctuations on spatial scales below @xmath43 .",
    "if such irregularities are produced by a turbulent cascade driven by motions of the neutral atmosphere , then we might also expect such events to be accompanied by significant position fluctuations induced by longer - wavelength modes within the inertial range ( since outer scales would exceed the neutral mean free path of 3 km , and thereby the size of the mwa ) . since @xmath44 and @xmath45 , when @xmath29 is small irregularities of a given scale size are both associated with larger phase fluctuations and have a greater chance of falling below @xmath43 .",
    "scintillation events are therefore more likely to occur at low frequencies .",
    "a source whose angular size exceeds @xmath46 will not scintillate , because the diffraction patterns associated with different parts of the source will blend together and average out . for the mwa at 154mhz ,",
    "the critical angular diameter below which a source can scintillate , given by the angle subtended by the fresnel scale at ionospheric heights , is about 10arcmin .",
    "such a source would be resolved in the images ( synthesised beamwidth @xmath12arcmin at 154mhz ) .",
    "the vast majority of radio sources in the sky are not resolved by the mwa , and so ionospheric scintillation events , when they occur , would be expected to affect a large number of sources in the data .",
    "this contrasts interplanetary and interstellar scintillation , which are only expected to affect the most compact sources @xcite .",
    "one way to distinguish ionosphere - induced variability from intrinsic variability is to check whether neighbouring sources are varying with a similar modulation index on a similar timescale .",
    "however , if it so happens that a highly localised patch of irregularities conspires to affect only an isolated source ( thus mimicking intrinsic variability ) , it is unlikely that this patch will remain in front of the source for very long .",
    "because of the rotation of the earth , in - situ stationary ionospheric irregularities will drift with respect to celestial sight lines at a rate of about 0.2degmin@xmath36 . given an average source spacing of 0.51@xmath47 for a 2-min integration with the mwa , it will only take a few minutes a given source to drift out of its patch of ionosphere and into its neighbour s .",
    "variability of an isolated source that continues for more than several minutes is therefore more likely to be intrinsic ( or perhaps of interplanetary / interstellar origin ) than ionospheric .    unlike position offsets , which are controlled by the largest - scale density structures ,",
    "amplitude variations are governed by irregularities on the smallest scales .",
    "large - scale density variations associated with tids and whistler ducts , the two most common types of structures appearing in mwa data @xcite , produce only negligible flux density changes : for the relatively extreme tec gradients measured by @xcite for whistler ducts , with angular deflections of @xmath481arcmin over @xmath49 km transverse scales , the associated fractional amplitude variations are estimated to be ) under simple geometric optics considerations , which are approximately valid under conditions of weak scintillation ( no interference effects ) . ]",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51 is the flux density . for tids , which have @xmath34arcsec and @xmath52 km , we find that @xmath53 .",
    "this is well below instrument sensitivities for 2-min integrations ( @xmath150mjy ; this has contributions from thermal noise , and also classical and sidelobe confusion ) for typical source brightnesses ( @xmath10.5jy ) at 154mhz .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment is required for small - scale irregularities .",
    "theoretical work considering the effects of scintillation on interferometric visibilities has been conducted by a number of authors , under various assumptions and approximations @xcite .",
    "a thin phase - screen model is often used , and the spectrum of small - scale fluctuations assumed to be a power law @xcite .",
    "the results have been shown to depend on many quantities , including the strength , spectral index and inner and outer scales for the phase fluctuation spectrum , the channel width , integration time and frequency of the observations , the altitude and thickness of the phase screen , and the fov and geometry of the array .",
    "compared to position offsets , which depend on just two free parameters ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , it is far less straightforward to estimate the variability of peak flux densities in the final synthesised images .",
    "the recent theoretical work of @xcite for realistic turbulence parameters suggests that ionospheric scintillation may be a substantial source of noise variance in the amplitudes and phases of visibilities recorded by widefield , low - frequency arrays .",
    "here we empirically assess scintillation effects on source flux densities for the case of the mwa at 154mhz .",
    "part of the usual calibration process of radio interferometric data is a removal of ionospheric effects . for conventional instruments , which have narrow fields of view and",
    "operate at higher frequencies , the ionosphere can be assumed to be locally uniform within the fov of each antenna . in this situation ,",
    "a single phase term for each antenna is sufficient for capturing the effects of the ionosphere .",
    "calibration algorithms such as phase referencing @xcite and self - calibration @xcite , which solve for a single phase correction term per antenna , are effective at removing ionospheric phases from the data .",
    "in contrast , the widefield nature of next - generation instruments implies that each antenna sees a large patch of the ionosphere , and the assumption of local uniformity breaks down @xcite .",
    "the ionospheric phase is now a direction - dependent function for each antenna , and this can not be removed using conventional calibration algorithms , which neglect direction dependencies . in this study",
    ", we analyse data for which only time - independent and direction - independent corrections to the antenna phases have been applied . the wide fov of the mwa , combined with its compact size , imply that antennas see almost identical phase screens and so differences in the ionospheric phase between antennas are expected to be small . the calibration process to which the data were subjected is therefore only effective for removing instrumental phase errors ( e.g.  due to slow temperature - induced changes in cable lengths ) , and leaves the ionospheric phase ( dominated by rapid time- and direction - dependent rather than antenna - dependent variations ) largely untouched .",
    "the data were recorded over a 30.72mhz band centred at 154mhz .",
    "data collection began in mid-2013 and took place one night each month . during an observing run , which typically lasted for 910hr",
    ", the telescope was pointed along the meridian at three different declinations , centred at zenith and zenith angles of @xmath130@xmath47 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "a series of 2-min snapshots were obtained at each declination in turn , the cycle repeating every 6min .",
    "the drift of the sky during each 2-min scan was accounted for during imaging by fixing the phase centre for each snapshot to be at a certain ra / dec .",
    "we have sub - divided the data by month and declination band , such that each dataset corresponds to a fixed pointing direction ( in az / el ) and contains snapshots from a single night .",
    "the naming convention here is `` year month declination '' , where for example `` 2013sep@xmath5555 '' refers to the dataset obtained in september of 2013 , with snapshots centred at @xmath56 on the meridian .",
    "this study analyses all mwats datasets currently available that have passed quality control , namely those for which post - calibration gain fluctuations lie within acceptable tolerances .",
    "although they were not selected based on any measure of ionospheric , geomagnetic , tropospheric or solar activity , we note that all mwats observations were done at night and happened to be conducted under quiet geomagnetic conditions ( @xmath57 index @xmath58 ) .",
    "our results should therefore be representative of typical quiet nighttime conditions above the observatory .",
    "it should be emphasised that these results do not apply to other times of the day , since the electron content undergoes large diurnal modulations , or observatories at other locations , because of the strong dependence on geomagnetic latitude .",
    "ionospheric irregularities are much more prevalent at equatorial and high latitudes , whereas mid - latitude sites such as where the mwa is situated are known to experience lower levels of activity @xcite .",
    "there are a total of 20 datasets accounting for 10 different nights and a total of about 51 hours of observation , spread over a period of slightly more than a year between 2013 and 2014 ( observing dates / times and central coordinates are listed in table [ tab : datasetparams ] ) .",

    "this suggests that the empirical value of @xmath125 is physically reasonable .",
    "systematic modulations in the amplitudes of celestial sources can be produced by propagation effects , but we now demonstrate that these are not sufficiently large to explain the observed concave - down pattern in the light curves ( fig .",

    "the light curves indicate that @xmath153 , and given that @xmath154 we can then solve for @xmath155 .",

    "this is significantly larger than can be attributed to absorption , which is @xmath1561% at 100mhz @xcite .",
    "if it were caused by scattering due to small - scale irregularities , then by conservation of total ( integrated ) flux density this should produce highly scatter - broadened sources ( larger by a factor of 20 ) , which are not observed in the data .",
    "that the concave - down attenuation pattern appears in all datasets and persists over entire nights of observation makes it unlikely that this is due to extreme ionospheric conditions , of the kind that might cause the observed distortion via the above effects .",
    "it is more likely that these systematic variations are instrumental in nature , arising from imperfect knowledge of the mwa primary beam .",
    "we have established that the typical scatter in angular position is 1020arcsec at 154mhz .",
    "although dominated by ionospheric refraction and several times larger than estimated fitting errors , this is sub - pixel for mwats the vast majority ( @xmath799% ) of the time and thereby almost always sub - synthesised beam for the mwa at 154mhz .",
    "this implies that ionospheric refraction is unlikely to present a major problem for the automated cross - matching of sources for time - domain astrophysics with the mwa at this frequency , as long as a cross - matching radius of @xmath112arcmin is used .",
    "however , there were several datasets in which higher levels of ionospheric activity causing sources to displace by angular distances of order the synthesised beam or more necessitated a larger cross - matching radius , which we set to 3.6arcmin",
    ".    for arrays with longer baselines such as lofar or an extended mwa , ionospheric effects will be a much bigger challenge .",

    "the full direction dependence of ionospheric phases may be necessary to achieve the objectives of time - domain astrophysics .",
    "fortunately , for a compact array such as the mwa , ionospheric effects appear not to adversely affect the ability to conduct these types of studies .",
    "our analysis does not include the effects of phase calibration errors , which manifest as a global shift of sources with respect to the underlying coordinate grid .",
    "we removed these by measuring angular displacements with respect to time - averaged positions , which isolates only the short - term fluctuations .",
    "however , the global shifts induced by calibration errors can be comparable to those resulting from ionospheric refraction , and present an independent source of difficulty for cross - matching .",
    "we find that short - term amplitude variations contain a component , separate from thermal noise and sidelobe confusion , that is described by a modulation index of @xmath145 13% .",
    "this is an empirical upper bound on ionospheric scintillation , and appears to be more important than thermal noise / sidelobe confusion for sources brighter than about 1jy for typical mwa sensitivities .",
    "this component may possibly arise from effects other than scintillation , but we do not pursue the investigation here .",
    "we note that ionospheric activity , characterised either by @xmath126 or @xmath125 , does not exhibit compelling correlations with either the rms noise or the s / n ratio of sources .",
    "thus , at least under the observing conditions of the datasets used in this study , the ionosphere does not appreciably affect the point - source sensitivity of the mwa .",
    "we detected a large - scale , concave - down modulation pattern in the peak flux density of sources as they transited through the fov .",
    "the variation is substantial , of order 10% , and is most probably related to an incomplete understanding of the primary beam gain pattern rather than an ionospheric effect ( see arguments in  [ sec : fluxinterpretation ] ) . in either case",

    "finally , we caution that this is not an exhaustive study of all data collected by the mwa .",

    "we found that :    * angular positions fluctuate by @xmath11020arcsec , these being below the synthesised beamwidth @xmath15799% of the time ; * there is a consistent preferred direction for angular position offsets , this being nw - se ( geographic ) , which matches prior reports of anisotropies observed in ionospheric density structures ; * an upper bound on the modulation index associated with ionospheric scintillation is @xmath113% ; * there is a persistent , concave - down modulation of the radio light curves over the mwa fov , but propagation effects have difficulty accounting for this .",
    "it appears that the ionosphere does not adversely affect the feasibility of time - domain science with the mwa at 154mhz , at least under conditions similar to those examined here .",
    "a cross - matching radius of 12arcmin is sufficient most of the time , but under more severe conditions it may be necessary to increase this to 34arcmin .",
    "light - curve error bars may be made more realistic by taking into account the existence of an extrinsic source of amplitude fluctuation characterised by a modulation index of several per cent .",
    "the occurrence rates of extreme events can not be established from our data ; this demands a broader investigation under a variety of geomagnetic and tropospheric conditions . we intend to pursue this in future work .",

    "<S> we find that while much of the variation in angular position can be attributed to ionospheric refraction , the characteristic displacements ( 1020arcsec ) at 154mhz are small enough that search radii of 12arcmin should be sufficient for cross - matching under typical conditions . by examining bulk trends in amplitude variability , </S>",
    "<S> we place upper limits on the modulation index associated with ionospheric scintillation of 13% for the various nights . for sources fainter than @xmath11jy , this variation is below the image noise at typical mwa sensitivities . </S>",
