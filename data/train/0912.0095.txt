    "the nernst effect in the normal state of high-@xmath5 cuprates has become a focus of renewed attention since the detection of an anomalous nernst signal in the normal state of underdoped cuprates  @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the large nernst signal is attributed to the movement of vortices which survives far above @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "a large negative nernst coefficient , which is comparable to the vortex signal in the superconducting state , has been reported in the charge density wave state of nbse@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "recently , it is reported that the stripe order causes the nernst signal to become large in nd or eu doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "thus , two mechanisms for the origin of nernst effect have been discussed up to now .",
    "the former supports the scenario that the superconducting gap opens far above @xmath5 , although the long - range phase coherence is destroyed by vortex excitation . while the latter implies that the superconductivity occurs near the quantum critical point where the competing orders , such as stripe order and/or charge order , cross in the phase diagram . here , to investigate the effects of the charge ( stripe )",
    "ordered state on nernst signal , we controlled the strength ( stability ) of the stripe order by introducing nd in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , and measured the nernst effect .",
    "the high - quality single crystals of la@xmath7nd@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath2 ( y=0 , 0.2 , and 0.4 ) were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone method .",
    "grown boule were carefully cut into rectangular shape confirming the crystal axis by using x - ray laue camera .",
    "all samples were carefully prepared to have the same doping level by fixing the sr content ( x=0.15 ) and the doping level was confirmed by the absolute values of the thermopower at room temperature .",
    "@xmath5 s determined by susceptibility were 37k , 23k , and 12k for y=0 , 0.2 , and 0.4 respectively .",
    "for the samples of y=0.2 and 0.4 , we observed an upturn in the resistivities around 50k and 70k , respectively , at which charge order has been observed  @xcite .",
    "nernst signal @xmath10 , which is defined as the transverse electric field @xmath11 per unit temperature - gradient ( @xmath12 ) , was measured with applying three different temperature - gradients ( @xmath13 0.5 , 0.75 , 1k / mm ) .",
    "temperatures and magnetic fields were stabilized during the measurement .",
    "since the nernst signal at high temperature is linear to magnetic field , we can define the nernst coefficient @xmath14 as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath14 in high temperature . to clarify the doping dependence , @xmath14 of nd - free sample with @xmath17=0.125",
    "is also plotted .",
    "note that the full scale of the vertical axis is as small as 20 nv / kt , which assures that the resolution of the measurement is better than 5 nv / kt . as seen in the figure , @xmath14 s of x=0.15",
    "are completely coincide irrespective of nd content .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath14 is almost consistent with the previous report  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the absolute value of @xmath14 at high temperatures is determined only by the doping level @xmath17 .",
    "more interestingly , the onset temperature @xmath3 , below which @xmath14 starts to deviate from high - temperature @xmath18-linear behavior ( normal - term nernst coefficient ) , does not change with nd - doping , even though the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 is drastically reduced .",
    "of la@xmath19nd@xmath8sr@xmath20cuo@xmath2 in high temperature.,width=257 ]    to investigate the effect of the stripe order , we show the temperature dependence of @xmath10 at 9 t in fig .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath10 drastically decreases with nd - doping below the temperature @xmath21 , where the magnetic field dependence of the nernst coefficient was observed ( @xmath21 was determined as ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "this result indicates that the fluctuation of superconductivity is suppressed by the stabilization of the stripe order due to nd - doping below @xmath21 . as seen in la@xmath22eu@xmath23sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 of ref.[3 ] , we observed the evolution of two - peak structure in the sample of x=0.4 .",
    "furthermore , an upturn of the nernst signal has been clearly observed below the charge order temperature @xmath4 ( see the inset of fig.2 ) .",
    "this is crucial evidence that the static stripe order enhances the nernst signal .",
    "based on the above results , we can define three characteristic temperatures : @xmath24 . with decreasing temperature",
    ", the following scenario is expected at this stage : on the assumption that the enhancement of the nernst signal is attributed to the effect of the stripe order at high temperatures , the fluctuation of the stripe order develops below @xmath3 , and then the static stripe order enhances the nernst signal further at @xmath4 . with further decrease of temperature , a huge nernst signal induced by the vortex flow is expected below @xmath21 .     at 9 t for la@xmath7nd@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath21 was determined as ref.[3 ] .",
    "inset : nernst signal e@xmath8 at 9 t for y=0.4 . to confirm reproducibility , we measured two different sample.,width=238 ]",
    "in order to investigate the effect of the charge ( stripe ) order on nernst signal , we measured the temperature and magnetic - field dependences of the nernst effect in nd - doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 single crystals with controlling the strength ( stability ) of the charge order .",
    "we found that the magnitude of nernst signal drastically decrease with nd doping below @xmath21 , although @xmath3 does not change conspicuously , and that the nernst signal is also enhanced at the charge ordered transition temperature @xmath25 .",
    "these results suggest that the stripe order as well as its fluctuation enhances the nernst signal at high temperatures , whereas the stabilized stripe order tends to suppress the superconducting fluctuation and hence to reduce the nernst signal at low temperatures .",
