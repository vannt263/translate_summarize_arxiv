    "a _ geometric network _ of points in the plane is an undirected graph whose vertices are points in @xmath2 and whose edges are straight - line segments connecting pairs of points . when edges are assigned lengths equal to the euclidean distance between their endpoints , the geometric network is called _",
    "euclidean network_. these networks are the objects of study in this paper ; concretely , we deal with _ plane _ euclidean networks in which there are no crossings between edges . for simplicity and when no confusion may arise , we shall simply say network , it being understood as plane euclidean network and , unless otherwise stated , networks are assumed to be connected .",
    "it is natural to distinguish between a network @xmath1 and its locus , denoted by @xmath0 , where one is considering not only the vertices of @xmath1 but the set of all points of the euclidean plane that are on @xmath1 ( thus , @xmath0 is treated indistinctly as a network or as a closed point set ) . roughly speaking , in order to compute the _ distance _ between two vertices of @xmath1 one has to sum the lengths of the edges of a shortest path connecting them , and",
    "the _ diameter _ of @xmath1 is the maximum among the distances between any two vertices .",
    "this concept is naturally extended to @xmath0 ; the difference is that now the distances that must be computed are not only between vertices but also between two arbitrary points on edges of @xmath1 . in this",
    "setting , a shortest path connecting two points of @xmath0 may consist of a number of edges and one or two fragments of edges ( in which the points to be connected are located ) . when computing the distance , we sum the lengths of all the edges in the path and the lengths of the fragments is the _ generalized diameter _ of @xmath1 , which was introduced in @xcite and called _ continuous diameter _ in @xcite , but we use the context of _ locus _ because it fits better to our purpose in this paper . ] .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "and @xmath3 is the diameter of the network , but the diameter of its locus is the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath5.,width=264 ]    in this paper we study the following problem :    [ ourproblem ] given a plane euclidean network @xmath1 , insert a finite set of segments @xmath6 in order to reduce ( or minimize ) the diameter of the locus of the resulting network , provided that the endpoints of segment @xmath7 are on @xmath0 and the endpoints of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , are on @xmath10 .",
    "( we say that @xmath11 is a _",
    "shortcut set _ for @xmath0 . )",
    "this type of problems is mainly motivated by urban network design : to introduce shortcut sets is a way of improving the worst - case travel time along networks of roads in a city , highways , etc .",
    "note that such models are considering the locus of the network , which is also used for related applications to location analysis @xcite and feed - link problems @xcite .",
    "one can find many other applications of euclidean networks to robotics , telecommunications networks , computer networks , and flight scheduling .",
    "any collection of objects that have some connections between them can be modeled as a geometric network .",
    "see @xcite for more details and references .",
    "problem [ ourproblem ] also belongs to the class of _ graph augmentation _ problems .",
    "concretely , it is a variant of the diameter - optimal @xmath12-augmentation problem for edge - weighted geometric graphs , where one has to insert @xmath12 additional edges ( i.e. , a shortcut set of size @xmath12 with segments connecting vertices ) to an edge - weighted plane geometric graph in order to minimize the diameter of the resulting graph . whilst there are numerous studies on the non - geometric version of this problem",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , when the input is an edge - weighted plane geometric graph , there are very few results not only on this problem but on graph augmentation in general ( see the survey @xcite for results and references on graph augmentation over plane geometric graphs ) .",
    "farshi et al .",
    "@xcite designed approximation algorithms for the problem of adding one edge to a plane euclidean network in @xmath13 while minimizing the dilation .",
    "the same problem is considered in @xcite but for networks embedded in a metric space . when considering the locus @xmath0 instead of the network @xmath1 ( setting of problem [ ourproblem ] ) , the hardness of the problem",
    "is enormously increased which motivates that , to the best of our knowledge , there are only two previous papers on this topic , both restricted to specific families of graphs .",
    "yang @xcite studied the restriction of problem [ ourproblem ] to inserting only one segment , called _ shortcut _ , to the locus of a simple polygonal chain to inserting only one segment to the locus of a general plane euclidean network was proposed by cai @xcite as a personal communication to yang @xcite . ] .",
    "among other results , he designed three different approximation algorithms to compute an _ optimal _",
    "shortcut , i.e. , a shortcut that minimizes the diameter among all shortcuts . on the other hand , in a very recent paper , de carufel et al .",
    "@xcite consider the possibility of inserting more than one segment ( all of them called shortcuts ) to the locus of a euclidean network @xmath1 to minimize the diameter .",
    "they define a shortcut as a segment with endpoints always on @xmath0 and smaller length than the distance in @xmath0 between its endpoints .",
    "nevertheless , their sets of shortcuts do not necessarily decrease the diameter of the resulting network .",
    "there are more differences with our definition of shortcut set : their shortcuts only intersect @xmath0 on its endpoints , and the possible intersection points between their shortcuts ( when inserting more than one ) are not considered as points of the resulting network . with this notion , they develop a study on paths and cycles determining in linear time optimal shortcuts for paths and optimal pairs of shortcuts for convex cycles .",
    "our main contribution in this paper is to provide the first approach to problem [ ourproblem ] for general plane euclidean networks .",
    "concretely , in section  [ sec : upper ] , we first characterize the networks @xmath1 whose locus @xmath0 admits a shortcut set . for such networks ,",
    "we find in polynomial time a shortcut set for @xmath0 giving an upper bound on its size .",
    "the section concludes by studying the connection between the diameter of the convex hull of @xmath0 and the diameter of the resulting network when inserting a shortcut set to @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ sec : scn1 ] is devoted to prove that it is always possible to determine in polynomial time whether inserting only one segment to @xmath0 suffices to reduce the diameter .",
    "our method computes such a segment in case of existence , and combines a remarkable number of tools that allow us to decide on the existence of that segment via analyzing intersections of certain arrangements of curves and certain regions .",
    "section 4 contains our first approach to two hard problems : to minimize the size of shortcut sets and to minimize the diameter of the resulting networks when inserting shortcut sets .",
    "we consider shortcut sets for non - connected networks , which is essential for proving our main result in this section : the np - completeness of the problem of deciding whether the minimum size of a shortcut set ( for @xmath0 not necessarily connected ) is smaller or equal than a fixed natural number .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : ccrr ] with some comments and open problems .",
    "we begin with some notations and definitions . as usual ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 denote , respectively , the vertex - set and the edge - set of a network @xmath1 , and @xmath16 is the _ degree _ of @xmath17 .",
    "an edge @xmath18 is _ pendant _ if either @xmath19 or @xmath3 is a _ pendant _ vertex ( i.e. , has degree 1 ) .",
    "we write @xmath20 for a point @xmath4 on @xmath0 , and distinguish the vertices of @xmath1 ( which are not assumed to be in general position ) saying that @xmath21 .    for @xmath22 , a",
    "_ @xmath4-@xmath5 path _",
    "@xmath23 is a sequence @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , @xmath4 is a point on an edge ( @xmath26 ) incident with @xmath27 , and @xmath5 is a point on an edge ( @xmath28 ) incident with @xmath29 .",
    "the _ length _ of @xmath23 , written as @xmath30 , is the sum of the lengths of all edges @xmath31 plus the lengths of the segments @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( which are edges when @xmath34 ) .",
    "the _ distance _ @xmath35 between points @xmath22 is the length of a shortest @xmath4-@xmath5 path in @xmath0 .",
    "eccentricity _ of a point @xmath20 is ecc@xmath36 and the _ diameter _ of @xmath0 is @xmath37 .",
    "two points @xmath38 are _ diametral _ whenever @xmath39 ; when in addition @xmath4 and @xmath5 are vertices , they are called _ diametral vertices _ of @xmath0 .",
    "these definitions for @xmath1 ( instead of @xmath0 ) are analogous ( and well - known ) , taking distances only between vertices of @xmath1 .",
    "when necessary , we shall use @xmath40 , ecc@xmath41 and @xmath42 for , respectively , distance on a network @xmath43 , eccentricity on @xmath43 , and euclidean distance .    as we set in problem [ ourproblem ] , we define a _ shortcut set _ for the locus @xmath0 of a network @xmath1 as a finite set @xmath44 of segments where @xmath7 has endpoints on @xmath0 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , has endpoints on @xmath10 satisfying that @xmath45 ; see figure [ fig : delia2](a ) . when @xmath46 consists of only one segment @xmath47 we say that @xmath47 is a _ shortcut _ ( in this case",
    ", @xmath48 is simply @xmath49 ) , and a shortcut @xmath47 is called _ simple _ if its two endpoints are the only intersection points with @xmath0 ; see figure [ fig : delia2](b ) .",
    "we want to point out that our definition of shortcut comes from that given in @xcite , which includes as a possibility the equality of the diameters of @xmath0 and @xmath50 ( and so the locus of every network has a shortcut ) , but we believe that the intuitive idea of shortcut is better captured by excluding that case . as it was explained in the introduction , our definition also differs from the shortcuts of @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the concept of shortcut set is natural in the context of euclidean networks , and we believe that its study is of interest not only from the theoretical point of view but also for the already mentioned applications of those networks to road networks , robotics , telecommunications networks , etc .",
    "this paper presents the first approach to its study for general plane euclidean networks . as main results we highlight that , while the problem of minimizing the size of a shortcut set is np - complete , plane euclidean networks whose locus admits a shortcut can be identified in polynomial time .",
    "our study opens many possibilities in this type of problems , such as its extension to other network parameters or to design methods for computing optimal shortcut sets .",
    "we leave for development in another paper to define shortcut sets for the radius and compare the results with those that we have obtained in this paper for the diameter .",
