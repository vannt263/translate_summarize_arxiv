    "there are several physical quantities in thermal physics that are difficult to understand because their operational definitions involve sophisticated reasoning .",
    "for example , what is temperature and what is the best way to introduce it ?",
    "one way to introduce the temperature is to invoke kinetic theory or the equipartition theorem and take the temperature to be proportional to the mean kinetic energy per particle of a system .",
    "however , the use of simple kinetic theory involves many approximations , which can lead to doubt and confusion in the minds of many students as to the generality of the relation between the temperature and kinetic energy .",
    "others will say that temperature is a measure of internal energy , and some will define the temperature as what a thermometer measures . however , the latter definition requires a long and subtle argument about how the change in some property of a thermometer ( such as the volume of a column of mercury ) can be calibrated .    to understand the role of temperature , it is necessary to realize that when two objects at different temperatures are brought into thermal contact , energy is transferred from the hotter object to the colder object until the temperature of the two objects becomes the same",
    "temperature is a measure of how easy it is for an object to give up its energy .",
    "the higher the temperature , the easier it is .",
    "it is a fact of nature that this single quantity determines the direction of energy transfer in systems near equilibrium .",
    "the nature of the chemical potential is even more obscure for beginning students of statistical physics.@xcite unlike temperature , the chemical potential is not familiar from everyday life .",
    "the chemical potential determines the direction of transfer of particles between systems that can exchange particles .",
    "the higher the chemical potential , the easier it for an object to give up particles .    when discussing abstract concepts , it is useful to think in terms of a simple model in order to strip away complicating factors that accompany actual measurements but are tangential to conceptual understanding .",
    "for example , we use ideal clocks and meter sticks when discussing time and space . for this reason",
    ", it would be useful to have an ideal thermometer .",
    "in this paper we will introduce an ideal thermometer in the context of computer simulations of thermal systems .",
    "we also will discuss a new simulation algorithm that can be used to measure the chemical potential .",
    "the latter is based on a generalization of the demon algorithm introduced by cruetz.@xcite",
    "computer simulations provide a vehicle for understanding many of the key concepts in statistical mechanics .",
    "most simulations are based on either monte carlo or molecular dynamics algorithms.@xcite in monte carlo simulations the configurations are sampled according to the appropriate probability distribution , and averages are computed from these configurations .",
    "one of the most influential monte carlo algorithms is the metropolis algorithm whose 50th anniversary was celebrated in 2003.@xcite this algorithm simulates a system at constant temperature @xmath0 , volume @xmath1 , and number of particles @xmath2 , that is , it samples configurations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we summarize it here so that the reader can see how it relates to the demon algorithm which we will describe next .    1 .",
    "begin with an arbitrary initial configuration with the desired values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "if the system consists of particles , the configuration would specify the positions of the particles .",
    "if the system were a lattice of spins , the configuration would consist of the orientation of each spin .",
    "2 .   make a trial change such as moving a particle at random or flipping a spin and compute the change in energy , @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath4 or if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a random number uniformly distributed in the unit interval , then accept the change . otherwise , reject the change , but include the unchanged configuration in the system averages . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "repeat steps 2 and 3 and compute various averages and their statistical uncertainties periodically . allow the system to equilibrate before computing averages .",
    "once the system has reached equilibrium , the metropolis algorithm produces configurations that occur with a probability proportional to the boltzmann distribution .    in the metropolis algorithm",
    "the temperature is an input parameter , and we can not obtain much insight into its nature by using this algorithm .",
    "we now describe the demon algorithm for which the energy is an input parameter and temperature is measured , thus providing a way of thinking about the temperature . in this algorithm",
    "one extra degree of freedom , called the demon , can exchange energy with the system of interest , and the energy of the system plus the demon is kept constant .",
    "the demon satisfies only one constraint , namely , its energy , @xmath9 , satisfies @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the demon algorithm samples configurations in the microcanonical or constant energy ensemble .    the steps of the demon algorithm can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "begin with an arbitrary initial configuration with the specified parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "obtaining such a configuration is usually more difficult than determining an initial configuration for the metropolis algorithm . for simplicity",
    ", we usually set @xmath12 , but we may give it any ( positive ) value such that the total energy @xmath11 has the desired value.@xcite 2 .",
    "make a trial change in the system and compute the change in energy , @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath13 , accept the change , and subtract @xmath3 from @xmath9 . otherwise , reject the change , but include the unchanged configuration as the new configuration .",
    "repeat steps 2 and 3 as in the metropolis algorithm .",
    "in addition , accumulate data for the histogram of demon energies , @xmath14 , after each monte carlo step per particle or lattice site .",
    "note that an immediate advantage of the demon algorithm is that fewer random numbers and no computationally expensive calculations of the exponential function are needed .",
    "thus , for some calculations the demon algorithm can be much faster than the metropolis algorithm.@xcite    we now discuss why the demon acts as an ideal thermometer",
    ". the latter should be as small as possible so that it does not affect the system of interest , and should have a convenient macroscopic property that changes in a well defined way with the temperature .",
    "the demon satisfies both conditions .",
    "if the system of interest has many degrees of freedom , the demon is a small perturbation of order @xmath15 on the system .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , the demon becomes less significant , and thus the demon becomes an ideal measuring device .",
    "the demon exchanges energy with the system , but does not change its energy very much .    to relate the properties of the demon to the temperature , we can go back to the fundamental definition of temperature , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the entropy and @xmath11 is the energy of the system .",
    "the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble is defined in terms of the number of states of the system with energy @xmath11 , @xmath18 : @xmath19 the basic principle of statistical mechanics is that all states with the same energy are equally likely , and because the demon can have only one state for each of its possible energy values , it follows that the probability of finding the demon with energy @xmath9 is proportional to the number of states of the system at energy @xmath11 , @xmath20 note that @xmath9 and @xmath11 are linearly related because @xmath21 is held fixed during the simulation .",
    "we can now determine the number of accessible states in terms of the entropy and its derivative : @xmath22 = \\exp\\big[s(e+e_d)/k - e_d \\frac{\\partial s(e)}{\\partial e } + \\cdots \\big].\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath23 we can ignore higher terms in the taylor expansion of the entropy . from the definition of the temperature , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deft ] ) , and the fact that @xmath24 is a constant , we find , @xmath25 thus a plot of @xmath26 versus @xmath9 will be a straight line with a slope of @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the demon measures the temperature without disturbing the system of interest .",
    "moreover , the mean value @xmath28 for any dimension if the demon energy distribution is continuous.@xcite note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ped ] ) is simply the boltzmann probability for a system at temperature @xmath0 to be in a microstate with energy @xmath9 .    by thinking about how the demon works",
    ", we can develop an intuition about temperature .",
    "for example , high temperatures or small @xmath29 implies that it is easy for the demon to obtain energy from the system , and hence a plot of @xmath26 versus @xmath9 would have a shallow slope . at low temperatures the system has difficulty",
    "giving up energy and thus the slope of @xmath26 would be steep .",
    "we also can see that the temperature is an intensive quantity .",
    "if we increase the size of the system ( doubling the volume and number of particles for example ) , the internal energy would double , but the temperature would be unchanged . from the perspective of the demon , the changes in the energy during trial moves",
    "do not depend on the size of the system , and thus there is no reason why the energy distribution of the demon should change , and hence the temperature measured by the demon is independent of the size of the system .    for many purposes the equipartition theorem provides a way of defining or determining the temperature .",
    "the theorem states that for a classical system in equilibrium with a heat bath at temperature @xmath0 , the mean value of each contribution to the total energy that is quadratic in a coordinate in phase space is @xmath30 .",
    "thus , for an ideal monatomic gas of @xmath2 particles in three dimensions , the total internal energy is given by @xmath31 .",
    "however , students frequently do not appreciate that this relation holds only for quadratic degrees of freedom and only for classical systems .",
    "the equipartition theorem also is independent of the interactions , if any , between the particles , a fact that is obscured by the usual derivations of the theorem for an ideal gas .    we can easily demonstrate the nature of the equipartition theorem by applying the demon algorithm to the ideal gas for which the kinetic energy of a particle is given by @xmath32 . in this case the trial moves are changes in the momentum @xmath33 of a particle .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the demon probability distribution for an ideal gas of @xmath34 particles in one and two dimensions .",
    "we find @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 , consistent with the predictions of the equipartition theorem to within a few percent .",
    "the agreement could be improved by running for more than only 3000 monte carlo steps per particle and by eliminating some of the higher energy results which have more scatter . also for these higher energies",
    "the demon energy has become a significant fraction of the total energy , and hence the boltzmann distribution becomes less applicable because of finite size effects .",
    "we can easily modify the simulation by assuming relativistic particles so that the kinetic energy of a particle is proportional to its momentum , that is , @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the demon algorithm still produces a linear plot for @xmath40 versus @xmath9 , but the temperature derived from this plot is not the same as that given by the kinetic energy per particle of the system . instead if @xmath39 , each momentum degree of freedom contributes @xmath41 to the mean energy . for a two - dimensional relativistic gas",
    "we find that @xmath42 from the demon energy distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , but @xmath43 , which is consistent with our expectation , but not with the usual statement of the equipartition theorem .    even though the internal energy is a function of temperature , these two concepts play different roles in thermodynamics .",
    "often students say that the temperature is a measure of the internal energy .",
    "some textbooks use the term thermal energy to refer to @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is less confusing to students if the difference between the concepts of energy and temperature is emphasized .",
    "temperature is a measure of the ability of a system to take on energy by heating or cooling .",
    "clearly , it has a conceptual role that is distinct from any form of energy .",
    "there are many systems that have no kinetic energy at all and yet these systems have a well defined temperature .",
    "for example , the ising model of magnetism assumes that the internal energy of a configuration of spins in the absence of an external magnetic field is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the coupling constant , which is usually set equal to unity in a simulation , and @xmath46 ; the index @xmath47 denotes the lattice site .",
    "the notation @xmath48 indicates that the sum is over nearest neighbor pairs of spins .",
    "the demon algorithm can be applied to the ising model , and indeed that was its first use.@xcite trial changes are made by choosing a spin at random and attempting to flip it . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show a plot of @xmath26 versus @xmath9 for the one - dimensional ising model .",
    "note that the possible values of the demon energy are multiples of 2 , because flipping a spin can only change the energy by 0 , 2 , or 4.@xcite the value of the slope of the fitted line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] implies that the temperature is approximately 0.625 .",
    "the mean system energy per spin is found to be @xmath49 ( in units for which @xmath50 ) .",
    "as is well known the energy increases with temperature , but the dependence is not linear .",
    "as we have mentioned , the probability distribution of the demon is not a perfect exponential for larger values of @xmath9 because of finite size effects that exist in any simulation .",
    "the reason goes back to the derivation of the boltzmann distribution .",
    "in such a derivation the system of interest is assumed to be small so that its energy fluctuations are much smaller than the fluctuations of the energy of the heat bath with which it is in thermal contact . in our simulations",
    "the demon plays the role of the system of interest , and the simulated system plays the role of the heat bath .",
    "as we have seen it is possible for the demon to obtain a significant fraction of the energy of the system .",
    "an example of this curvature can be seen in the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] of @xmath40 for larger @xmath9 ; in this simulation @xmath51 and the mean energy of the demon is 1.68 , which is 16.8% of the total energy of the system .",
    "another desirable feature of the demon algorithm is that it can be used in conjunction with other simulations .",
    "we could add the demon algorithm to a metropolis or md simulation and measure the temperature with the demon and compare it to other measures of the temperature .",
    "just as temperature measures the ability of a system to transfer energy to another system and pressure is a measure of the ability of a system to transfer volume , the chemical potential is a measure of the ability of a system to transfer particles .",
    "two systems in thermal and particle equilibrium will come to the same temperature and the same chemical potential .",
    "the chemical potential can be measured using the metropolis algorithm and the widom insertion method.@xcite from thermodynamics we know that @xmath52 in the limit @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the helmholtz free energy and @xmath55 is the @xmath2-particle partition function .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 is the average of @xmath57 over all possible states of the added particle with added energy @xmath3 . in a monte carlo simulation with widom insertion",
    "we would compute the change in the energy @xmath3 that would occur if an imaginary particle were added to the @xmath2 particle system at random for many configurations generated by the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the chemical potential is then given by @xmath58 where the average @xmath59 is over many configurations distributed according to the boltzmann distribution .",
    "note that in the widom insertion method , no particle is actually added to the system during the simulation .    if we consider an ideal classical gas and consider only the momentum degrees of freedom , then eq .",
    "( [ insertion ] ) would lead to the usual analytical result for @xmath60 ( see eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) ) if we include a factor of @xmath15 in the argument of the logarithm to account for the indistinguishability factor @xmath61 in @xmath62 .",
    "because the contribution to the chemical potential due to the momentum degrees of freedom is known exactly , only the position degrees of freedom are retained in typical monte carlo simulations of interacting systems , and the chemical potential in eq .",
    "( [ insertion ] ) is interpreted as the excess chemical potential beyond the ideal gas contribution.@xcite    although the widom insertion method gives some insight into the nature of the chemical potential , it is not easy to obtain an intuitive understanding of the chemical potential.@xcite for example , why is the chemical potential negative for a classical ideal gas ? a theoretical argument for the sign of the chemical potential is the following.@xcite if we add a particle to a closed system at constant volume and energy , we have from the fundamental thermodynamic relation @xmath63 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fund ] ) we see that adding a particle with no change in energy , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , can be done only if @xmath66 . because adding a particle at constant energy and volume can only increase the entropy",
    ", we must have @xmath67 .",
    "this argument breaks down for fermions at low temperatures because the low energy states are already filled and thus @xmath68 .    to understand the role of the chemical potential , we have extended the demon algorithm so that the demon also can hold particles .",
    "if we use the thermodynamic definition of @xmath60 , @xmath69 and follow the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ped ] ) , we can show that the probability that the demon has energy @xmath9 and @xmath70 particles is given by : @xmath71 thus , the slope of @xmath72 versus @xmath70 for fixed @xmath9 yields @xmath73 and the demon serves as an ideal measuring device for the chemical potential .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : macroprob ] ) more generally is the probability of a system at temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath60 to be in a microstate with @xmath70 particles and energy @xmath9 .    for simplicity , we introduce a lattice in phase space , including the momentum degrees of freedom , to do our simulations .",
    "the generalized demon algorithm for such a lattice is as follows :    1 .",
    "begin with an arbitrary initial configuration with the desired energy @xmath11 and number of particles @xmath2 .",
    "one way to do so is to add one particle at a time to random lattice sites , computing the total energy at each step until we have added @xmath2 particles and reached the desired energy . in the simple systems we will consider here ,",
    "there are many zero energy states so that we can simultaneously obtain the desired @xmath11 and @xmath2 .",
    "set @xmath12 and @xmath74 .",
    "2 .   choose a lattice site in the system at random .",
    "3 .   if there is a particle present at this site , compute the change in energy @xmath3 that would result if the particle were removed .",
    "if the demon has sufficient energy , then accept the change , subtract @xmath3 from the demon , and increase @xmath70 by 1 , where @xmath70 is the number of particles held by the demon .",
    "otherwise , reject the move , but include the unchanged configuration as the new configuration .",
    "go to step 5 .",
    "if there is no particle present and the demon contains at least one particle , attempt to place a particle at the chosen site by computing the change in energy , @xmath3 , needed to add a particle .",
    "if @xmath13 , then accept the move , subtract @xmath3 from @xmath9 , and let @xmath75 .",
    "otherwise reject the move , but include the unchanged configuration as the new configuration .",
    "repeat steps 24 and compute various averages and their statistical uncertainties as before .",
    "accumulate data for @xmath76 after each monte carlo step per lattice site .    as can be seem ,",
    "these modifications of the usual demon algorithm are straightforward .",
    "for dilute systems there is no need to include particle moves as in the original demon algorithm .",
    "these moves are not necessary because every such move is equivalent to a particle removal at one site and insertion at another .",
    "thus , all possible configurations can be reached by only using particle insertions and removals . however , for dense systems the probability of adding a particle is so low that particle moves would become necessary to obtain a reasonable exploration of phase space .",
    "we can plot @xmath72 versus @xmath9 for a particular value of @xmath70 or versus @xmath70 for a given value of @xmath9 .",
    "the slope of the first plot is @xmath27 and the slope of the second is @xmath73 .",
    "sometimes , there is some curvature in the plot of @xmath72 versus @xmath70 , which makes it difficult to extract the chemical potential .",
    "this curvature occurs when the number of particles in the demon becomes a significant fraction of @xmath2 .",
    "we first consider an ideal classical gas for which the positions and momenta of the particles take on discrete values . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider one spatial dimension so that we can visualize the phase space of the system as a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the length of the lattice along the position axis in phase space is the size of the system , @xmath77 , but the length in the momentum direction could be infinite .",
    "however , we need only to make it large enough so that the probability of a particle having a momentum larger than the extent of our momentum axis is negligible . for our simulations we chose @xmath78 and the momentum axis to extend from @xmath79 to 10",
    ". visual inspection of the particles in phase space showed that the particles were never near the ends of the momentum axis , and thus the extent of the momentum axis was sufficiently large . in order that all energies ( @xmath80 ) be integers , we set the mass @xmath81 . in this way each energy index of the array for @xmath82 equals an unique value of the energy .    for simplicity ,",
    "we impose the restriction that no two particles can occupy the same lattice site in phase space . in the dilute limit",
    ", this restriction will have a negligible effect on the results , but we will show how the restriction changes our results for high density , low energy systems . in analytical calculations phase space is divided into cells , which is necessary to allow for the counting of states .",
    "this imposition is further justified using arguments about the uncertainty principle .",
    "a trial move consists of choosing a phase space cell or site at random and either attempting to add a particle if it is empty or attempting to give the particle to the demon if the site is occupied .",
    "because we choose a state not a particle , our algorithm automatically implies the indistinguishability of the particles .",
    "our lattice model corresponds to a semi - classical model of a ideal gas for which a factor of @xmath61 has been included to account for particle indistinguishability.@xcite this factor is only accurate in the dilute limit because it allows more than one particle per state .",
    "as far as we know , this lattice model of an ideal gas has not been simulated in an educational context , probably because most calculations can be done analytically . however ,",
    "by thinking about how the simulations work , we believe that students can obtain a more concrete understanding . for example , setting up phase space as a two - dimensional lattice and showing the configurations can provide an animated visual representation which can help students better understand the meaning of the analytical calculations .",
    "the results for @xmath83 versus @xmath9 and @xmath70 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and 10000mcs .",
    "we include all the data so the reader will know what to expect .",
    "the results for large values of @xmath9 or @xmath70 are not accurate because they correspond to probabilities that are too small for the simulation to determine accurately .",
    "if we were to run significantly longer , we would obtain more accurate values .",
    "a linear fit to those parts of the data that fall on a straight line leads to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "is derived assuming @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 in our units . also , we have @xmath81 and @xmath92 .",
    "thus , in our units eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) reduces to @xmath93}. \\label{analytic2}\\ ] ] figure  [ fig5 ] shows the chemical potential extracted from the slopes of @xmath83 as a function of the density @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "all data were generated with at least 1000mcs , which is sufficient to yield @xmath60 to within a few percent . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the numerical data is indistinguishable from the analytical results for small @xmath96 , but deviations occur for larger @xmath96 , where the analytical value for the chemical potential in eq .",
    "( [ analytic2 ] ) is less than the value from the simulations .",
    "the reason is that although the analytical calculation includes the same states as the lattice model , the analytical result also includes states with multiple occupancy , which become important as the density increases .",
    "because the lattice model has fewer states than is included in the analytical calculation , it is more difficult to add a particle to the system , and we should obtain a larger chemical potential ( less negative ) . the increased difficulty in adding particles to the system leads to a higher probability that the demon will have more particles and thus a shallower slope for @xmath83 versus @xmath70 .    we can test this explanation further by changing our simulation so that more than one particle is allowed at any site in phase space .",
    "because the analytical calculation undercounts such states , we expect our simulation to lead to a lower value for the chemical potential than the analytical value . for a dense system with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , we find @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which is lower than the analytical value of @xmath102 .",
    "however , for the same conditions with only single particle occupancy allowed , we find @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which is larger than the analytical value of @xmath105 for this value of @xmath0 .",
    "a negative chemical potential means a negative slope for @xmath83 versus @xmath70 .",
    "again we can understand why the chemical potential must be negative . if it were not , then the probability that the demon has @xmath70 particles would increase with increasing @xmath70 instead of decreasing .",
    "although particles can easily move into the demon because it lowers the system s energy to do so , there are many places in phase space for the demon to return particles to the system if the density is small .",
    "any energy the demon receives from taking in a particle can be used to return the particle to the system .",
    "thus , the demon and the system will quickly come to equilibrium such that the mean number of demon particles is much less than the mean number of particles in the system .",
    "however , if the system is very dense , then the system acts as a dense fermi gas at low temperatures for which the chemical potential should be positive .    at high densities and low energies",
    ", it becomes very difficult to find a place in phase space to return a particle to the system , and hence the mean number of particles in the demon is a significant fraction of all the particles , and is no longer a small perturbation on the system .",
    "thus we would not expect to find an exponential distribution , and we instead find a gaussian distribution as shown in fig .",
    "( a parabolic plot for @xmath106 indicates a gaussian distribution for @xmath107 . ) however , even though the demon takes on many particles , most of them have zero energy , and the plot of @xmath106 versus @xmath9 is still linear . for this particular simulation",
    "the temperature was @xmath108 .",
    "if the chemical potential were negative , then near @xmath74 the slope of @xmath109 would be negative . in our simulation",
    "it is positive which indicates a positive chemical potential .",
    "our simple ideal gas lattice model also provides another example of how the equipartition theorem is not always applicable . for a relatively long run of 32,000mcs with @xmath110 and @xmath34 ,",
    "the average energy per particle in the system was found to be 1.965 and the temperature measured by the demon was 3.76 .",
    "( the demon holds part of the total energy , so the average energy per particle in the system must be less than @xmath111 . ) by the equipartition function , each degree of freedom provides @xmath112 in energy , and thus the temperature is given by @xmath113 or @xmath114 .",
    "the difference between this predicted value and the simulation value is statistically significant and is due to the discrete nature of the possible energy values in the simulation .",
    "we next discuss the effects of including interactions between the particles in the system and consider a lattice - based model with a hard core repulsion so that no two particles can be at the same position even if they have different momenta .",
    "we also consider a model with a hard core and an attractive square well interaction between nearest neighbor particles with an energy depth equal to @xmath115 .",
    "we will call these models the hard core and square well models , respectively .",
    "our results are shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "for all these runs at least 1000mcs were done .    for dilute systems , @xmath116 or @xmath117",
    ", we see that the temperature is the same , @xmath118 , for all three systems with the same initial energy per particle , @xmath119 . for the denser system with @xmath120 ,",
    "the three models have different temperatures because the interactions are now important .",
    "the difference between the ideal and hard core gas is small .",
    "however , the temperature is significantly higher for the square well model .",
    "the reason is that if there is an attractive square well , some of the total energy is ( negative ) potential energy , and thus the total kinetic energy must be greater to maintain the same sum of kinetic and potential energies as for the other two systems .",
    "the chemical potentials shown in table  [ table1 ] are approximately the same for the dilute low temperature ideal gas and hard core systems , but the existence of the attractive well lowers the chemical potential slightly .",
    "the reason is that adding a particle can lower the energy if there is an attractive square well .",
    "as the temperature increases , this effect becomes less important because the kinetic energy dominates the potential energy .    in the dense system , @xmath120 , the differences between the three models become more pronounced .",
    "adding a hard core repulsion increases the chemical potential , because the hard core makes it more difficult for the system to accept particles compared to the ideal gas .",
    "when we add the attractive square well , the energy for particles to be added next to existing particles is lowered , thus making it easier for the system to gain particles .",
    "the result is a lowering of the chemical potential compared to the hard core model , which is what we find in our simulations .",
    "thus , our results confirm the idea that the chemical potential measures how easy it is for a system to accept particles .",
    "we can do analogous simulations without a lattice using a similar procedure . instead of visiting a lattice site and determining",
    "if there is a particle present , we introduce a small volume in phase space , @xmath121 , choose a location in phase space at random , and determine if there is a particle in this volume centered at the chosen location .",
    "the results for the chemical potential will depend on the value of @xmath121 , in analogy to choosing a value for the cell size in the analytical calculations",
    ". however , this dependence is not important because only differences in the chemical potential are physically meaningful .    to compare with our previous results , we simulated a one - dimensional hard core gas including the momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "we set @xmath122 to be consistent with the value used in our lattice simulations .",
    "because we used a spherical volume ( a disk in two - dimensional phase space ) , the radius of the disk was chosen to be @xmath123 , so that its area equals unity . for @xmath116 and @xmath124",
    "we obtained the same results as with a lattice system within statistical errors .    a common inter - particle potential used to model the interaction of simple atoms is the lennard - jones potential defined by @xmath125 , \\label{lj}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 ( equal to @xmath127 m for argon ) is the diameter of the repulsive part of the potential and @xmath128 ( equal to @xmath129j for argon ) is the depth of the attractive part .",
    "the potential is cutoff at @xmath130 to reduce the number of interactions .",
    "we choose units such that @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we did a simulation at low temperature with parameters @xmath85 , @xmath97 , and a momentum axis ranging from @xmath115 to @xmath133 .",
    "this range for the momentum axis is sufficiently large because we initialized the system by randomly placing particles in phase space so that the total energy did not exceed @xmath134 .",
    "after about 2000mcs we found the system energy to be @xmath135 , corresponding to a temperature of 0.60 ( corresponding to 72k for argon ) from the mean demon energy and a chemical potential of @xmath136 ( corresponding to @xmath137j or about 0.003ev ) from the demon particle distribution .",
    "the chemical potential is close to zero because the total system energy is so low that the amount of phase space available for adding a particle is small .",
    "this explanation for the value of the chemical potential reminds us that the chemical potential is not just a measure of the energy needed to add a particle , but also is a measure of the number of available states for adding a particle .",
    "the usual demon algorithm and its generalization can be used to help students understand the concepts of temperature and chemical potential .",
    "we believe that discussions of these algorithms in a thermal and statistical physics class can give students a more concrete model of thermal and diffusive interactions than is possible by formal mathematical derivations .",
    "although students will gain even more understanding by writing and running their own programs , much of the benefit can be obtained by discussing the algorithms and how they lead to a measure of the temperature and chemical potential .",
    "it also is important to ask students to describe how the demon s energy and particle number distributions will change under different circumstances .",
