    "the astronomical observations indicate that most of the matter in our universe is dark ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the evidences come mainly from the gravitational effects of the dark matter component , such as the rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite , the gravitational lensing @xcite and the dynamics of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the studies of primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite , structure formation @xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite show that this so - called dark matter ( dm ) is mostly non - baryonic .",
    "the nature of the non - baryonic dark matter remains one of the most outstanding puzzles in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "a large amount of theoretical models of dm have been proposed in literatures @xcite .",
    "all these candidates of non - baryonic dm particles require physics beyond the standard model of particle physics . among the large amount of candidates , the most attractive scenario involves the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "in particular , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) provides an excellent wimp candidate as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , usually the neutralino , which are stable due to r - parity conservation @xcite .",
    "wimps are possible to be detected beyond the gravitational effects .",
    "one viable way is to detect the elastic scattering signals of dm particles on the detector nuclei ( direct searches ) @xcite .",
    "this is the most sensitive method at present for dm detection @xcite .",
    "another way is to search the self - annihilation prodcuts of the dm particles ( indirect searches ) , such as neutrinos @xcite , @xmath0-rays @xcite , antiprotons @xcite and positrons @xcite . since the positrons , antiprotons and diffuse @xmath0-rays are secondary particles in the cosmic rays with low fluxes , these kinds of dm annihilation products are easier to be distinguished from the astrophysical background .",
    "direct and indirect detections of dm particles are complementary ways to each other .",
    "the balloon - borne instrument high - energy antimatter telescope ( heat ) was designed to determine the positron fraction over a wide energy range with high statitical and systematic accuracy .",
    "based on the three flights(1994 , 1995 and 2000 ) , this collaboration reported an excess of positrons with energies higher than several @xmath1 and peaked in the range @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it seems that the astrophysical production can not give enough positrons as observed @xcite , and there might exist exotic sources of positrons .",
    "it has been pointed out that the excess may indicate the signal of dm annihilation @xcite .",
    "however , baltz showed that for supersymmetry ( susy ) dm a `` boost factor '' @xmath3 has to be introduced to fit the heat data @xcite .",
    "it was thought that the local clumpiness of dm distribution might account for this `` boost factor '' .",
    "however , hooper argued that it was less possible for a dm clump to be close enough to the earth to contribute sufficient positron flux @xcite .",
    "stimulated by the recent numerical simulation which shows that the lightest subhalos in the galaxy could be extended to @xmath4 with a huge amount of about @xmath5 @xcite , we try to calculate the galactic positron flux again in the frame of supersymmetry taking the enhancement by the large amount of subhalos into account .",
    "there was effort try to explain the heat data by the nearby mini - clumps @xcite .",
    "however , the possibility of this scenario is also extremely low @xcite .",
    "another difference of this work from the previous studies most of which adopt the green s function method to calculate the positron s propagation is that we calculate its propagation in the galactic magnetic field using the numerical package galprop @xcite , which adopts realistic distribution of interstellar gas and radiation field .",
    "our result shows that the two methods lead to some difference . to give a consistent result",
    "we also calculate the secondary positron flux using galprop .",
    "the propagation parameters are adjusted to fit observations such as b / c , proton and electron spectra .",
    "our results show that the secondary positron has better agreement with the heat data than which adopted in previous studies @xcite and decreases the tension between predictions and data .",

    "[ anni ] we present the susy model . in sec .",

    "the lsp , generally the lightest neutralino , is stable in the r - parity conservative mssm and provides a natural candidate of dark matter .",
    "it is a combination state of the supersymmetric partners of the photon , @xmath6 boson and neutral higgs bosons .",
    "positrons can be produced in several neutralino annihilation modes .",
    "most of them come from the decay of gauge bosons produced in chanels @xmath7 , or from the cascades of final particles , such as fermions and higgs bosons .",
    "the spectrum of positrons depends on the neutralino mass and its annihilation modes .",
    "there is also a direct channel @xmath8 and produces monochrome positrons with energy @xmath9 .",
    "however , the branching ratio of this channel is usually small . in the following discussion",
    "we neglect this `` line '' contribution to the positron spectrum .",
    "the source function of positrons from dm annihilation can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the positron generating cross - section , @xmath12 is the positrons spectrum in one annihilation by a pair of neutralinos and @xmath13 is neutralino density distribution in space .",
    "the source term @xmath14 is given in unit of @xmath15 .",
    "the source term is calculated in mssm by doing a random scan using the software package darksusy @xcite . in these susy models",
    "we choose a few models which satisfy all the experimental bounds and give large fluxes and appropriate spectrum so that we can fit the heat data well . however , there are more than one hundred free susy breaking parameters even for the r - parity conservative mssm .",
    "a general practice is to assume some relations between the parameters and greatly reduce the number of free parameters . for the processes related with dark matter production and annihilation , only seven parameters are relevant under some simplifying assumptions , i.e. , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath16 , the wino mass parameter @xmath17 , the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath18 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath19 , the scalar fermion mass parameter @xmath20 , the trilinear soft breaking parameter @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "to determine the low energy spectrum of the susy particles and coupling vertices , the following assumptions have been made : all the sfermions have common soft - breaking mass parameters @xmath20 ; all trilinear parameters are zero except those of the third family ; the bino , wino , and gluino have the mass relations , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , coming from the unification of the gaugino mass at the grand unification scale .",
    "the parameters are constrained in the following ranges : @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ; @xmath28 .",
    "the susy models are required to satisfy the theoretical consistency requirement , such as the correct vacuum breaking pattern , the neutralino being the lsp and so on .",
    "the accelerator data constrains the models further from the spectrum requirement , the invisible z - boson width , the branching ratio of @xmath29 and the muon magnetic moment .",
    "the constraint from cosmology is also taken into account by requiring the relic abundance of neutralino @xmath30 , which corresponds to the 3@xmath11 bound from the cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "the effect of coannihilation between the fermions is taken into account when calculating the relic density numerically .",
    "to determine the positron source term from dm annihilation in eq .",
    "( [ positronsource ] ) we have to specify the dm density profile @xmath13 .",
    "based on the n - body simulation results the dm density profile can be written in a general form as @xcite @xmath31^{(\\beta -\\gamma)/\\alpha } } , \\label{rho}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the scale density and scale radius respectively .",
    "these two parameters are determined by the measurement of the virial mass of the halo and the concentration parameter determined by simulation .",
    "the nfw profile was first proposed by navarro , frenk and white @xcite with @xmath34 .",
    "however , moore _",
    "_ gave another form of dm profile with @xmath35 to fit their simulation result @xcite .",
    "the moore profile has steeper slope near the galactic center than the nfw profile .",
    "there are also simulations showing that the density profile may not be universial @xcite .",
    "reed et al .",
    "show that @xmath36 increases for halos with smaller masses @xcite .",
    "therefore we also adopt a @xmath37 profile for the whole range of dm halos for simplicity . at present",
    "there are controversials on which one represents the actual density profile .    for a dm halo with mass @xmath38",
    ", we adopt a semi - analytic model of bullock @xcite , which describes the concentration parameter @xmath39 as a function of viral mass and redshift , to determine the parameters in the density profile .",
    "we plot the @xmath40 relation in figure [ con ] , with the @xmath41 range . the median @xmath42 relation at redshift zero is adopted .",
    "the scale radius is then determined as @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the virial radius @xmath46 in above formula is defined by @xmath47 with @xmath48 and the critical density of the universe @xmath49 .",
    "once @xmath50 is fixed , the scale density @xmath51 can be got by solving the equation @xmath52 . in figure [ clump_para ]",
    "we show the scale radius @xmath50 , scale density @xmath51 , virial radius @xmath46 , surface mass density @xmath53 , effective volume @xmath54 , intrinsic boost factor @xmath55 as functions of masses @xmath38 , for the dm halos with nfw mass distributions .",
    "we adopt a reference mass density @xmath56 .",
    "each of these charicteristic quantities is scaled by its maximum value in the mass range @xmath57 , the minimal and maximal masses of the milky way ( mw ) subhalos we adopt in the following discussion .",
    "we list these scale factors as : @xmath58 the behaviors of these quantities can be understood as following . for nfw profile , an analytic calculation shows that @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . because the concentration parameter @xmath39 is weakly dependent on the mass according to figure [ con ]",
    ", @xmath50 is approximately proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "the scale density @xmath51 is nearly @xmath62 , which shows a slight decrease as the increase of halo mass , while the surface density @xmath63 is almost constant .",
    "the effective volume @xmath64 is approximately scaled with @xmath65 , and the intrinsic boost factor @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is a little smaller for higher mass halos , because it is less concentrated for higher mass halo .",
    "having known the general properties of the dm halos given above , we now turn to the discussion of the mw subhalos .",
    "high resolution simulations have revealed that a large number of self - bound substructures survived in the galactic halos @xcite .",
    "especially a recent simulation conducted by diemand et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the first generation objects as light as the earth mass can survive until today .",
    "the number of such minihalos is huge , reaching @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of a wealth of subhalos will greatly enhance the dm annihilation flux , since the annihilation rate is propotional to the density square as shown in eq .",
    "( [ positronsource ] ) .",
    "the simulations show that the number density of subhalos can be approximately given by an isothermal profile with a core @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the relative number density at the scale radius @xmath70 , with @xmath70 being about @xmath71 times the halo virial radius @xmath72 .",
    "the result given above agrees well with that in another recent simulation by gao et al.@xcite .",
    "( [ dis ] ) shows that the radial distribution of substructures is generally shallower than the density profile of the smooth background in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .",
    "this is due to the tidal disruption of substructures which is most effective near the galactic center .",
    "the mass function is well fitted to the simulation result as @xmath73 .",
    "we then get the number density of substructures with mass @xmath74 at the position @xmath75 to the galactic center @xmath76 where @xmath38 is the virial mass of the mw , @xmath77 is the normalization factor determined by requiring the number of subhalos with mass larger than @xmath78 is about 500 in a halo with @xmath79@xcite .    taking the subhalos into account the density square in eq .",
    "( [ positronsource ] ) is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 means the average density square of subhalos according to the distribution probability . since there is no correlation between the mass and spatial distribution in eq .",

    "we defined a function @xmath86 in the equation above as @xmath87 which depends only on the subhalo mass since the virial radius and the density profile are all determined by the subhalo mass .",
    "the minimal subhalos can be as light as @xmath4 @xcite while the maximal mass of substructures is taken to be @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "we notice that there are unphysical singularities at the center of the subhalo which may lead to @xmath86 divergent for the index @xmath0 equal to or greater than @xmath89 .",
    "a cutoff @xmath90 is introduced within which the dm density is kept a constant value @xmath91 due to the balance between the annihilation rate and the rate to fill the region by infalling dm particles @xcite . applying typical setting of parameters , we get @xmath92 . in the following discussion , @xmath93 is adopted for nfw and moore profiles while we consider @xmath94 for the profile with @xmath95 . from eq .",

    "we can see from this figure that subhalos of different mass bins contribute almost the same to the annihilation products . by extending the minimal subhalo mass from the present numerical resolution of about @xmath98 to @xmath99",
    ", the contribution will be @xmath100 times larger .",
    "figure [ rho2 ] shows @xmath101 for different dm profiles",
    ". the existence of subhalos will increase @xmath102 significantly at large radii . because the annihilation source is density square dependent",
    ", the further clumpiness of dm will effectively increase the annihilation signals , and can play the role of a `` boost factor '' .",
    "the more concentrated of the halo profile , the larger of the @xmath101 value .",
    "while at small radii there is no enhancement compared to the smooth component for the tidal disruption makes the subhalos be difficult to survive in inner galaxy .",
    "we can see that the model with the most cuspy subhalos adopted here has @xmath103 times larger @xmath101 than the smooth one at the solar location , which means that the positron flux observed on the earth will be higher by about an order of magnitude .",
    "a complexity in calculating the positron flux is that positrons are scattered by the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) and we have to calculate its propagation in gmf .",
    "the propagation of charged particles in the gmf is diffusive .",
    "in addition they will also experience energy loss processes due to ionization and coulomb interaction in the interstellar medium ; for electrons and positrons there are additional synchrotron radiation in the gmf , bremsstrahlung radiation in the interstellar medium and inverse compton scattering in the interstellar radiation field .",
    "the interaction between cosmic - ray particles and the interstellar medium ( mostly hydrogen and helium ) will lead to the fragmentation of nuclei . for radioactive nuclei",
    "the decay should be also taken into account .",

    "( [ positronsource ] ) are also shown .",
    "we see that propagation makes the spectra some different from the source spectra .",
    "this is because the propagation is energy dependent .",
    "the source spectra are somewhat different among the three models because these models lead to different annihilation final states . in the calculation a moore profile for the smooth component and @xmath95 profile for subhalos with @xmath132 are adopted .    in figure [ spectrum_prof ]",

    "it indicates that the fluxes can be different for several times among various dm profiles .",
    "the cuspier profiles lead to higher positron fluxes .",
    "it should be noted that because of the propagation effects the spectra from different dm profiles are different , although they have the same source spectrum . at lower energy",
    "the fluxes have bigger differences , since the low energy positrons have longer propagation distance , and may trace the @xmath134 farther away from the earth .",
    "the differences between the nfw ( or moore ) profile with and without subhalos are not significant . for subhalos with @xmath135 profile",
    "the flux is greatly enhanced .",

    "the fluxes for @xmath136 and @xmath137 gev based on the green s functions given by kamionkowski & turner @xcite and baltz & edsjo @xcite are plotted .",
    "the be green s function is to solve the diffusive propagation equation analytically and similar to the galprop method . however , galprop uses realistic astrophysical inputs , and can contain more complex physical process such as reacceleration , while in be s method only an average energy loss rate is considered and without convection or reacceleration . after adjusting the propagation parameters to be equivalent ,",
    "we get similar results between these two models .",
    "kt s result shows a larger difference from these two models .",
    "this is comprehensible that the kt green s function is acquired by solving the leaky - box equation of propagation with a position - independent source . at low energies",
    "the discrepancy is larger because of longer propagation path .    to give a consistent galactic positron flux we calculate the background ( secondary ) positron fraction generated by interaction between primary cosmic - rays and interstellar gas in the same propagation model using galprop . in the figures [ ratio ] and [ ratio195 ] we give the background positron fraction .",
    "our results give better description to heat data compared with the adapted background fraction in @xcite .",
    "therefore the new results requries a smaller `` boost factor '' to the dm annihilation signals .    adding the positron flux coming from dm annihilation to the secondary positrons we get the total positron flux . the positron fraction @xmath138 is plotted in fig . [ ratio ] for @xmath136 gev .",
    "we can see from this figure that the expectation reproduces the measurements relatively well if dm subhalos are taken into account .",
    "the model with subhalos can contribute several times more than which without subhalos .",
    "the best fit to the heat data requries `` adjustment factor '' of @xmath139 and @xmath140 for signals from dm annihilation without and with subhalos respectively .",
    "we do nt think the discrepancy of a factor @xmath140 is serious since there are large uncertainties in calculating the positron fluxes .",
    "firstly there are uncertainties for the positron propagation , as shown in figure [ propmodel ] .",
    "secondly the random distribution of dm subhalos may have large variance as discussed in @xcite since positrons lose energy quickly and have large fluctuations .",
    "the variance may lead to large positron flux due to accidence , while in this work we just give the average positron flux .",
    "thirdly we can choose susy model which produces more positrons , as shown in figure [ ratio195 ] for a model with @xmath141 .",
    "the best fit to heat data requries a factor of @xmath142 for this model .",
    "it is remarkable that without introducing a large `` boost factor '' nor the nonthermal production of neutralinos as done in @xcite we could explain the heat data quite well .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at about 8@xmath1 , heat measurements show some fine structures of the positron fraction , which can not appear in our calculation .",
    "maybe there are some specific sources or some specific physical process to generate positrons at this energy . however , the errors of the data are too big to give a definite assertion of this property .",
    "if it is confirmed by further experiments such as ams-2 , there should be deeper studies about the models we used here .    in summary , in this work",
    "we give a consitent and detailed calculation of the galactic positron flux .",
    "we recalculate the background positron flux from cosmic - ray collisions with the interstellar gas in a realistic propagation model galprop .",
    "the results soft the discrepancy between data and expectations .",
    "for the primary positrons from dm annihilation we take the enhancement of subhalos into account .",
    "the result shows that the heat data can be explained by the two components without introducing `` boost factor '' or nonthermal production of dm . to account for the excess of positron flux extending subhalo masses to @xmath143 and requiring a cuspy profile as @xmath95 are necessary .",
