    "numerous studies over the past decade have found that star - forming galaxies have undergone strong evolution in their luminosity and number density since redshift of @xmath5 , and that luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies play a critical role in this evolution .",
    "the peak of the far - infrared background detected by _",
    "cobe _ is at @xmath6 m , with energy comparable to the optical / uv background @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath750%  of the integrated rest - frame optical / uv emission in the universe has to be thermally reprocessed by dust and radiated at the mid to far - infrared .",
    "deep iso 15@xmath8 m number counts , and more recently , _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath8 m number counts , suggest a large excess of mid - ir sources compared to the predictions by nonevolving models @xcite .",
    "particularly , the _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath8 m number counts imply that a significant population of sources with flux densities on the order of 100@xmath8jy are likely infrared luminous galaxies at @xmath9 , previously undetected in the iso data .",
    "furthermore , the strong evolution of infrared luminous galaxies at @xmath10 was directly characterized by the infrared luminosity functions from studies of iso 15@xmath8 m sources with optical redshifts @xcite , in addition , optical spectroscopy of optically faint , radio - selected , s@xmath11  mjy submillimeter galaxies has found that these sources are at a median redshift of 2.3 @xcite . their inferred volume density , @xmath12 at @xmath13 , is roughly two to three orders of magnitude higher in comparison with the local density of iras ultraluminous galaxies at the similar luminosity limit @xcite .",
    "although iso and sub - mm observations have revealed many tantalizing facets of the dusty universe at @xmath9 , the successful launch of _ spitzer _ , with its combined fast photometric mapping and spectroscopic capabilities , has made it possible to discover and characterize large numbers of dusty , infrared luminous galaxies at cosmologically interesting redshifts . of critical significance",
    "is that the mid - ir spectroscopic properties of infrared luminous galaxies at @xmath14 are virtually unknown .",
    "the mid - ir spectra of starburst galaxies and most ulirgs are dominated by the emission and absorption features of dust grains . while the shape of the mid - ir continuum and its brightness relative to the far - infrared constrain the amounts of hot and cold dust , the strong pah emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and @xmath15 m and silicate absorption ( centered at @xmath16 and @xmath17 m ) provide both an indication of the type of source heating the dust ( since pah s are easily destroyed by uv photons and x - rays from an agn ) and redshift estimates for sources that are completely obscured at shorter wavelengths @xcite . with the sensitivity and wavelength coverage of the infrared spectrograph ( * ? ? ?",
    "* irs ; ) on _ spitzer _ , it is now possible to obtain the mid - ir spectral diagnostics of dusty galaxies out to @xmath18 .    in this paper",
    ", we report initial results of a go-1 program to obtain low resolution , mid - infrared spectra of a sample of 52 galaxies in the _ spitzer _ first look survey ( fls ) over an area of 3.7deg@xmath19 .",
    "our targets were potential high redshift candidates , selected based on the color criteria described in detail in  2 .",
    "eight sources in our target sample were observed between august 27 to september 6 , 2004 , while the remainder of the full sample has been scheduled for 2005 . in this paper , we report the first results from the analyses of these eight targets .",
    "these eight sources have 24@xmath8 m fluxes and mid - ir colors representative of the full sample , and provide an initial look at the data we expect to obtain for the complete sample . since very few mid - ir spectra of galaxies with @xmath20 have been published , and the lifetime of spitzer is short , these initial results are valuable for planning future irs observations of high - redshift , luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 describes the our target selection and the irs observation design in detail ;  3 discusses the imaging reduction and 1d spectral extraction procedures we used in this dataset ;  4 presents the results and we discuss the implications of our findings in  5 . throughout the paper , we adopted the cosmology of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "our _ spitzer _ go-1 program was designed to obtain mid - infrared spectra of a sample of 24@xmath8 m sources , selected to be starburst candidates at @xmath23 based on their mid - ir colors .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "data used for our target selection are the 24 and 8@xmath8 m catalogs from the fls main survey region @xcite . in order to obtain good quality irs spectra in reasonably short integration times , we required all spectroscopic targets to be brighter than 0.9mjy at 24@xmath8 m .",
    "we applied additional color constraints in order to select potential starburst galaxies at @xmath20 .",
    "this is based on @xmath24 and @xmath25  micron colors . here",
    "we define @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the criteria used to select the irs targets are @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these color cuts are determined by comparing the observed 24/8 and 24/0.7  @xmath8",
    "m color distributions of _ all _ 24@xmath8 m sources over the fls region with the computed color tracks as a function of redshift using a set of known mid - ir spectral templates .",
    "the detailed discussion on the mid - ir color distributions in the fls has been published in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 condition is a crude redshift selection , and the @xmath28 cutoff selects sources with very steep , red continua , as seen in many local starbursts and ulirgs @xcite . in  5 , we will discuss how well our selection criteria work with respect to our observations .",
    "over the 3.7deg@xmath30 region , a total of 59 sources meet the 24@xmath8 m flux and the color cuts .",
    "due to the limited number of hours available to our program , we targeted 52 , chosen randomly from the total 59 sources .",
    "for all of the targets , we obtain low resolution ( @xmath31 ) spectra in long - low module of the irs ( ll , 14 ",
    "40@xmath8 m ) . for a few sources with the irac 8@xmath8",
    "m fluxes greater than @xmath32jy , we also obtained 1st order , short - low spectra ( sl , 7.514@xmath8 m ) .",
    "table 1 lists the positions , the broad band 24@xmath8 m , 8@xmath8 m and r - band fluxes , and the exposure times for these eight sources . in all of the observations",
    ", we used nearby bright stars as peak - up to accurately center the slit on the science targets .",
    "the irs slit width is @xmath33 for the sl and @xmath34 for the ll .",
    "our targets are all unresolved , point sources with the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the 8 and 24@xmath8 m images respectively",
    ". thus , in our irs observations there should be neglible light loss due to the finite irs slit width .",
    "the raw spectral data are first processed by the irs pipeline ( s11.0.2 version ) at the spitzer science center ( ssc ) .",
    "the processing steps taken by the irs pipeline include ramp fitting , dark sky subtraction , droop correction , linearity correction , flat fielding , and wavelength and flux calibration . for our sl data ,",
    "stray light correction is not necessary because the peak - up images do not have any sources bright enough to have significant stray light contaminations in the sl spectra .",
    "we therefore used the uncorrected output from the ssc pipeline .    starting with the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) basic calibrated data ( bcd ) produced by the irs pipeline , we performed additional processing , including background subtraction and making new bad pixel mask for the coadded image at each nod position .",
    "the background subtraction was tested with three different methods : ( 1 ) the subtraction of a  supersky \" , constructed by median combining all of the available 2d images , excluding the images at the same order and the same nod position .",
    "this supersky is scaled and then subtracted from the individual exposure before summing up all exposures at each nod position , ( 2 ) by differencing the exposures at two nod positions along the slit , then summing up all the exposures at the same nod position , ( 3 ) the subtraction of a supersky constructed only from the exposures within a single aor .",
    "the supersky methods ( 1 &  3 ) improve the background signal - to - noise ratio by @xmath710 - 20% .",
    "however , for some fields , when the mean background levels are significantly different from the supersky , the number of `` warm pixels '' can be higher than using the difference of the nod positions . in these cases , we simply take the difference of the two nod positions . in all cases , we chose the subtraction method that gives the best signal - to - noise ratio as well as the fewest number of residual bad pixels .",
    "after the background subtraction , we compare the 2d spectra of the same target at the two nod positions and remove any bad pixels within the spectral extraction aperture by visual examination .",
    "usually , there are less than 10 pixels which need to be masked manually in addition to the bad pixel masks .",
    "these bad pixels are not considered in the subsequent , 1d extracted spectra , and do not contribute to the final average of the spectra from the two nod positions .      as described in  2 ,",
    "spectra were taken in two nod positions for each irs slit .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra were extracted , then averaged to produce the final 1d spectrum for each module .",
    "the spectral extraction is done using the ssc software spice v1.3 .",
    "spice is a java based tool which allows the user to interactively display and extract irs spectra .",
    "the spectral centroiding and extraction aperture can be adjusted to maximize the s / n ratio . for our data",
    ", we used an extraction aperture , whose width is 1 or 2 pixels narrower than the default psf size in spice , and the shape of the extraction aperture simply follows the psf size as a function of wavelength .",
    "this method minimizes the uncertainties due to the background , and maximizes the s / n ratios for faint spectra .",
    "we used the simple method of summing up the light within the extraction aperture and did not use optimal extraction technique for our data .",
    "the version of all of the calibration files used by spice is consistent with the irs pipeline version s11.0.2 .",
    "the flux scales of the final , averaged sl and ll spectra were set by using the irac 8@xmath8 m and mips 24@xmath8 m broad band fluxes .",
    "the accuracy of our flux calibration is thus primarily determined by the irac 8@xmath8 m and mips 24@xmath8 m calibration errors , roughly ( 5 - 10)% ( see the _ spitzer _",
    "observers manual ; also reach et al . in prep ) .",
    "figure 1a , b , c , d show the 1d spectra of the eight sources observed by the irs . in figure 1 , the color coded lines represent the 1d spectra in the original resolution , with the red segment for the irs ll 1st order , the blue for the ll 2nd order , and the green for the sl 1st order . to aid the identification of pah emission features",
    ", we smoothed our observed 1d spectra by roughly 5 - 7  pixels .",
    "the smoothed spectra are shown by the black lines , and are shifted by an arbitary amount in the y - axis for viewing clarity .",
    "the smoothing kernel is a boxcar , and roughly @xmath37  pixels wide .",
    "the size of the smoothing kernel is chosen so that at the rest - frame wavelength it is similar to the the rest - frame fwhm of the 7.7@xmath8 m pah emission in ugc  5101 @xcite .",
    "strong , multiple pah emission features ( 6.2,7.7,8.6 and 11.2@xmath8 m ) are detected in two sources , irs9 and irs2 , and weak pah emission ( 7.7@xmath8 m and 6.2@xmath8 m or 8.6@xmath8 m ) in additional two ( irs6 and irs11 ) . a broad absorption trough , roughly centered at the observed wavelength of 27 - 36@xmath8 m , is also detected in six out of eight spectra .",
    "we associate this broad feature with redshifted silicate absorption at a central rest - frame wavelength of 9.7@xmath8 m .",
    "based on these emission and absorption features , the inferred redshifts are in the range of @xmath38 for these six sources . the remaining two spectra ( figure 1d )",
    "have well detected continua , but no other identifiable spectral features .",
    "the redshifts for these two sources are unknown .",
    "for the six sources with either pah emission and/or silicate absorption at the rest - frame 9.7@xmath8 m , we measure their redshifts using the following procedures .",
    "two of our sources have only broad silicate absorption troughs , thus , their redshift measurements have large errors , on the order of 0.1 - 0.2 . in the remaining four sources , we have multiple spectral features , both pah emission and silicate absorption .",
    "pah features are generally sharper than silicate absorption , thus give more accurate measurements of redshifts .",
    "in each of these cases , the final redshift is determined by the combined @xmath39 measurements from the multiple features .",
    "specifically , for each pah feature , the redshift @xmath40 is derived as @xmath41 .",
    "here @xmath42 indicates one of the pah features , and its rest - frame wavelength is measured from the spectra of local starburst galaxies taken with the irs in the same slit and resolution .",
    "the local reference spectra were ngc7714 and ugc5101 ( brandl et al .",
    "2004 ; armus et al .",
    "the final redshift is the average value of @xmath43 , and the error is computed as @xmath44 .",
    "the redshift discrepencies between different pah features reflect the contributions from the wavelength measurement error in determining the centroid of pah feature and the systematic errors in the irs wavelength calibration .",
    "sharper pah emission features will have smaller measurement errors in the wavelength centroids .",
    "the redshifts for the six sources are in the range of 1.8 - 2.6 .",
    "the redshift errors for irs2 and irs9 are smaller , since both have pah emission lines at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.2@xmath8 m .",
    "irs9 has four strong pah features .",
    "its 6.2 and 11.2@xmath8 m features are narrow and used for the final redshift determination .",
    "the spectrum for irs11 is peculiar .",
    "its absorption line at 9.7@xmath8 m is saturated with a flattened bottom .",
    "this is reflected in the large uncertainty , 0.2 , for its redshift .",
    "an alternative way of determining the redshift is to fit the observed spectra using a set of mid - infrared spectral templates of local galaxies with prominent pah and silicate features ( template cross - correlation method ) .",
    "we found that the redshifts measured from these two methods are consistent .",
    "the limitation in the template cross - correlation method is that it has to assume some templates and it is difficult to determine what local template spectra are representative of high redshift spectra . for this paper",
    ", we are limited to a few , high quality spectra which have been published .",
    "we have used the interpolated model templates from chary &  elbaz ( 2001 ) , as well as the published irs spectra of ugc  5101 , mrk1014 , iras  f00183 - 7111 and ngc7714 @xcite . the strongest signal for determining redshift using",
    "the template fitting method comes from the silicate absorption feature . for this paper",
    ", we choose to use redshifts measured from pah and silicate features .",
    "table 2 presents the redshifts and the errors for the six targets .",
    "multiple , strong pah emission features are detected in two sources and weak pah emission in additional two .",
    "table 2 lists the pah flux and its @xmath45 for each feature .",
    "the flux is measured by fitting a gaussian profile with continuum subtracted , and a linear continuum computed over roughly a wavelength range of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 being the fitted pah feature ) . given our low s / n spectra ,",
    "we have adopted this simple approach to measure the continuum and the line flux .",
    "the @xmath48 noise for each pah feature is computed as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the noise per pixel measured from the continuum near the emission line , @xmath51 is the fwhm of the emission line in pixel , and @xmath52 is the size of the pixel in @xmath8m / pixel .",
    "the significance of the detection ( s / n ) is computed as @xmath53 . the @xmath50 is measured from the original spectrum and the feature profile fitting is done with the smoothed spectrum . as shown in table 2 ,",
    "the @xmath45 ratio for each individual pah feature is geater than 3 for irs2 and irs9 , and in the range of @xmath54 for irs6 and irs9 .",
    "although individual @xmath45 ratio seems to be small , the final redshift measurement is much more reliable when the identified , multiple features are consistent .",
    "one pecularity about the irs9 spectrum is its unusually strong 11.2@xmath8 m line , in comparison with ugc5101 , f00183 - 7111 and ngc7714 @xcite .",
    "the relative line luminosity between 6.2 and 11.2@xmath8 m is 0.75 for irs9 .",
    "one study in local hii regions @xcite seems to suggest that this ratio less than 1 are mostly in low metallicity objects .",
    "in addition , the theoretical models of pah emission @xcite show that luminosity ratio of 11.2-to-7.7@xmath8 m features is closely linked to ionization state of pah , and the high ratio is indicative of presence of a large amount of neutral pah , with ism similar to photo - disassociate - region ( pdr ) .    the strength of silicate absorption is an excellent indicator of dust extinction at the mid - infrared .",
    "precise measurement of the absorption strength sometimes can be difficult when the feature is not very strong and the continuum is affected by strong pah emission at the both side of the absorption trough .",
    "of the six targets with redshifts , at least four have strong silicate absorption . in the other two sources ,",
    "irs9 and irs11 , the absorption due to silicate material is probably present , but the estimate of the depth of the absorption is largely uncertain .",
    "this is mainly due to the poor determination of the continuum level using the low @xmath45 spectra covering a fairly narrow wavelength region .",
    "although comprehensive modeling of our mid - ir spectra is beyond the scope of this paper , we can use the following methods to provide a simple estimate of the dust obscuration in our sources .",
    "the depth of the absorption feature can be used as an indication of the obscuration .",
    "the opacity at the bottom of the silicate absorption trough is estimated as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the flux densities at the center of the trough without and with absorption respectively .",
    "the continuum is measured using clean continuum location at rest - frame 7 and 14@xmath8 m .",
    "@xmath57 is taken as the minimum of the flux density at the bottom of the absorption trough .",
    "table 2 lists @xmath58 values for the six sources we detect the silicate absorption .",
    "the amount of dust obscuration is highly uncertain in irs11 .",
    "its spectrum shows that the absorption minimum is flattening out to zero , suggesting a large amount of dust along the line - of - sight .",
    "however , the level continuum for this source could also be low , thus the inferred absorption strength would be small .",
    "it requires a better @xmath45 ratio spectrum to draw more definitive conclusion on its dust obscuration for this object . from @xmath58",
    "listed in table 2 , the implied extinction at the visible wavelength is large , if we assume @xmath59 @xcite . the estimated lower limits on @xmath60 is @xmath61  magnitudes , which is comparable to that of local ulirgs .    another method would be to use the absorption coefficients computed by li &  draine ( li &  draine 2001 ) , based on a simple cold screen model .",
    "the computed spectra , @xmath62 , are used to fit the observed spectra between in the rest - frame @xmath63 m .",
    "the estimated column density is in the range of @xmath64@xmath65 .",
    "we should point out that the uncertainties in the quantative analyses of silicate absorption feature and the dust extinction are mostly from determination of continuum and unknown geometric distribution of dust .",
    "while both estimates of the extinction towards the line of sight to the nuclei are valid , major uncertainties remain concerning the distribution of the dust , the dust - to - gas ratio , the metallicity and the proper level of the continuum .",
    "therefore , the derived values should be treated as rather uncertain estimates of the lower limit of extinction along the line of sight to the nuclei of these high - redshift galaxies .      while our irs spectra covering the rest - frame 5 - 15@xmath8 m do provide constraints on the slopes of the mid - ir seds , the far - infrared emission , which dominates the bolometric luminosity , remains unconstrained for most of our sample , except irs9 . for irs9 , we have a mips @xmath66 detection at 70@xmath8 m with the flux of 42mjy . at 160@xmath8 m , we have only a @xmath67 upper limit of 150mjy .",
    "irs9 is also detected at 1.2 mm with 6@xmath68 of 2.5mjy with mambo @xcite .",
    "combining all of the data together , we estimate that @xmath69 for irs9 is @xmath70 .",
    "the uncertainty for irs9 is probably witin a factor of 2 - 3 . for the remaining five sources with redshifts , the crude estimates of their bolometric luminosities",
    "were done using the template fitting method . as templates",
    ", we used the irs spectra of ugc5101 , mrk1014 , iras  f00183 - 7111 and ngc7714 @xcite .",
    "the derived bolometric luminosities are in the range between @xmath71 .",
    "these luminosities are likely uncertain to factors of @xmath72 because the selection of the best - fit , rest - frame mid - infrared spectrum from a limited number of templates does not ensure an accurate estimate of the bolometric luminosity , especially the cold dust component .",
    "however , since the templates include pure starbursts , composite sources , and pure agn , they likely provide a fair representation in bolometric luminosity , energetic type and degree of dust obscuration , of the sources in our sample . iras  f00183 - 7111",
    "is very luminous , highly obscured source , ugc 5101 has a powerful starburst and a buried agn , mrk 1014 is a type-1 dusty qso , and ngc 7714 is a bright , nearby starburst ( not a ulirg ) . both mrk 1014 and ngc 7714 have very little extinction along the line of sight to their nuclei ( as evidenced by the lack of silicate absorption in their irs spectra ) . with these uncertainties in mind ,",
    "our derived luminosities suggest that the observed galaxies are as luminous , and likely much more luminous , than typical low - redshift ulirgs .",
    "more importantly , our sources with pah emission features are a factor of ( 5 - 10 ) more luminous than starburst dominated ulirgs in the local universe .",
    "with redshift information , we compute pah luminosities and estimate their contributions to the bolometric infrared luminosities . table 3 lists the pah - to - bolometric luminosity ratios and the rest - frame equivalent widths , including the data for the local benchmarks .",
    "the @xmath73 is @xmath74 and @xmath75 for irs2 and irs9 respectively .",
    "these values are similar to ugc5101 , a highly obscured and starburst dominant system .",
    "and they are much higher than those of mrk1014 ( type - i , ir loud qso ) and f00183 - 7111 ( a highly obscured composite ulirg ) .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent widths at 6.2 and 7.7@xmath8 m are comparable to those of ugc5101 in irs9 . in irs2 the equivalent widths are smaller than in ugc 5101 bu about a factor of three .",
    "the irs spectra of irs9 and to a lesser extent , irs2 , both indicate a dominant contribution to the bolometric luminosity from a dusty starburst ( as in ugc 5101 ) . in irs2",
    "a buried agn might be contributing at irs wavelengths , decreasing the equivalent width of the pah features by increasing the continuum from hot dust .",
    "the starburst - like nature of irs9 is further supported by its detections at 70@xmath8 m with _ spitzer _ and at 1.2 mm with mambo on iram 30  meter telescope .    for comparison with published iso results on the pah emission strength in ulirgs , we measured the 7.7@xmath8 m line - to - continuum ratio @xmath76 for irs2 and irs9 . with two anchor points at the rest - frame 7 and 14@xmath8 m ,",
    "the ratios are 1 and 1.3 for irs9 and irs2 respectively .",
    "an @xmath77 is shown by various iso studies to imply a dominant starburst contribution to the mid - infrared flux @xcite . since both irs9 and irs2",
    "meet this criterion , it is likely that they are starburst - like ulirgs .",
    "the remaining four of the six sources with redshifts have silicate absorption , but weak or no pah emission . in irs6 and irs11 ,",
    "the @xmath45 of individual pah feature is only at the level of @xmath78 .",
    "irs1 and irs8 have no detectable pah emission .",
    "if we take the pah fluxes or @xmath48 upper limits , and bolometric luminosities listed in table 2 , the implied 7.7@xmath8 m line - to - bolometric luminosity ratios are ( 2 , 10 , 8 and 6)@xmath79 for irs1 , irs6 , irs8 and irs11 respectively . these ratios should be taken as upper limits . compared with those of the local galaxies in table 3 , these numbers suggest that irs1 is probably a system mostly dominanted by an obscured agn , whereas the remaining three sources , irs6 , irs8 and irs11 , are dusty , composite systems with both agn and starburst contributions to their infrared luminosities .",
    "finally , irs4 and irs10 have only continua without any identifiable spectral features .",
    "their redshifts can not be measured from the irs spectra .",
    "their observed irs spectra from 8 - 38@xmath8 m can exclude the possibilities that these two objects have _ strong _ pah emission lines at both low and high redshifts .",
    "the observed power law continua suggest that they are probably type i qsos , with very little pah emission at either low or high redshifts .",
    "although our statistics are poor at this stage , we can assess the effectiveness at which our color criteria select for high - redshift , dusty galaxies .",
    "primarily , we select sources with very red 24-to-8 and 24-to-0.7 micron colors .",
    "these red color cuts are chosen to target dusty , starburst galaxies at @xmath80 .",
    "the irs gto team has recently published another sample of @xmath2 ulirgs with the spitzer mid - ir spectra ( houck et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one of the differences between our sample and the houck et al .",
    "sample is in the initial target selection .",
    "we utilized irac 8@xmath8 m photometry and applied uniform flux ratio cuts in two colors , whereas the houck et al .",
    "sample targeted only optically faint , 24@xmath8 m sources .",
    "particularly , our red 24-to-8  @xmath8 m color criterion selects sources with red , mid - ir continua .",
    "of the eight targets , @xmath81% have redshifts of @xmath20 .",
    "our selection clearly works well in targeting high redshift systems , and results in a higher fraction of sources with measurable redshifts based on the mid - ir spectra than that of the houck et al . sample . in our small sample ,",
    "at least four and possibly six sources show strong silicate absorption , indicating large columns of cold dust along the line - of - sight to the nuclei . while a red , steeply rising mid - infrared continuum suggests the presence of warm dust , the detected silicate absorption indicates also the cold dust .",
    "our result may suggest a broad correlation between red mid - ir continua and silicate absorption .",
    "further studies with larger samples are clearly needed . finally , our data detected , for the first time , strong multiple pah emission features in starbursts at @xmath2 , and our sample seems to have a higher fraction of systems with pah emission than the houck et al . sample .",
    "this could be due to the differences in the sample selection functions .",
    "although our sample selection was designed to target specifically starburst galaxies with strong pah emission , the fraction of such sources in our sample is rather small , @xmath82%  from this small subsample .",
    "most of our targets seem to have either undetected , or weak , pah emission compared to low - redshift ulirgs .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising given the luminosity of our targets , and the fact that at low redshift , there appears to be a trend toward more agn - like mid - ir spectra at luminosities above @xmath83 ( tran et al .",
    "2001 ; charmandaris et al .",
    "a similar trend is seen in @xmath2 sources with the irs selected via different color criteria ( houck et al . 2005 ) . we should emphasize that although these extremely luminous galaxies have agn - like mid - ir spectra with weak pah emission , they could still have some amount of starburst components .",
    "local examples of this type of sources are mrk231 and iras f00183 - 7111 @xcite .",
    "although mrk231 has weak pah emission , its @xmath84 ratio is much smaller than that of a typical agn - dominant or qso @xcite , indicating that starburst contributes to the bolometric infrared luminosity .",
    "our results suggest that we need to reach fainter apparent mid - infrared flux levels to uncover larger populations of starburst - dominated sources at these redshifts with the irs .    for comparison , the comoving number density of sub - mm detected galaxies at @xmath85",
    "is roughly @xmath86 for @xmath87 @xcite , and the the rest - frame uv color selected galaxies have co - moving space density of @xmath88 for the balmer break selected galaxies at @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "although our current sample is very small , it is illustrative to compute the co - moving number density of infrared luminous galaxies at @xmath2 . of all of the 24@xmath8 m sources detected over @xmath91deg@xmath19 ,",
    "59 sources meet our sample selection criteria .",
    "if we assume @xmath81%  of these 59 sources being at @xmath92 , the comoving number density is @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "given the large uncertainties , our estimate is probably consistent with that of sub - mm sources and is roughly 1%  of the uv selected @xmath96 galaxies .",
    "this paper presents the mid - ir spectra of eight sources from our _ spitzer _ go-1 program , designed to investigate the spectroscopic properties of high - redshift dusty , infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "we detect mid - ir spectral features , either emission lines from pah or silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath8 m , among six out of eight targets .",
    "the inferred redshifts , based only on the mid - ir spectra , are at @xmath1 .",
    "the remaining two sources have strong continuum but no identifiable spectral lines .",
    "the main conclusions based on these eight mid - ir spectra are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) our sample selection is effective in targeting ulirgs at high redshifts with pah emission and/or silicate absorption .",
    "the high 24@xmath8 m to r - band flux density ratio criterion filters out low redshift galaxies , while the high 24/8@xmath8 m ratio favors the selection of galaxies with red , steeply rising spectra .",
    "the sample yields the redshift measurement efficiency of @xmath81% .",
    "( 2 ) more than half of our sample ( 5/8 ) has prominent silicate absorption lines at 9.7@xmath8 m , indicative of high dust obscuration in these @xmath96 sources .",
    "( 3 ) we detect multiple pah emission features from two sources ( 2/8=25% ) .",
    "compared to local ulirgs , their line - to - bolometric luminosity ratios and equivalent widths suggest that they are powered by extremely luminous starbursts .",
    "these starbursts at @xmath2 are a factor of ( 5 - 10 ) more luminous than the local starburst dominated ulirgs .",
    "these data are the first direct evidence that aromatic features are already a significant component of the dusty galaxy spectra as early as z=2 .",
    "( 4 ) the remaining four of the six sources with redshifts ( 4/8=60% ) have weak or no pah emission , and are likely composite systems having both a starburst and a buried agn .",
    "although the statistics thus far are small , our selection criteria appear to be good at isolating @xmath2 ulirgs with , in most cases , spectra most resembling agn - dominated ulirgs at low - z .",
    "however , these data also suggest that small pah emitting dust grains are present and directly observable in up to @xmath97% of our ulirgs at @xmath98 .",
    "since the irs integration times we have used for these data are relatively short , this bodes extremely well for the goal of directly using _ spitzer _ to spectroscopically classify high - redshift luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "we are grateful to the irs instrument team and the irs instrument support team at the spitzer science center for their tremendous effort to make this instrument such a great success .",
    "we thank tom soifer for stimulating discussions on the nature of these luminous sources . support for this work",
    "was provided by nasa through award issues by jpl / caltech .",
    "* figure 1 - panel d : * the caption is the same as in * panel a*. these two spectra have no strong silicate absorption .",
    "irs10 with weak pah emission is plotted in the rest - frame , and irs4 with no identifiable features is presented in the observed frame since the redshifts are unknown .",
