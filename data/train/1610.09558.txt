    "rogue waves refer to extremely large oceanic surface waves . as a result of their devastating impact on marine systems , such as ships and offshore platforms ,",
    "rogue waves have been the subject of numerous theoretical , experimental and numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "most studies concern the frequency and statistics of rogue wave occurrence for a given sea state ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , often desirable to know , for a given ocean area , _ if _ , _ when _ and _ where _ a rogue wave may occur in the future .",
    "these questions can in principle be addressed by numerically solving the appropriate hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "apart from its high computational cost , this direct approach requires a well - resolved state of the fluid velocity field and its free surface elevation as initial conditions .",
    "thanks to recent developments , real - time and reliable measurement of sea surface elevation is feasible ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . but the well - resolved measurement of fluid velocity field remains out of reach .",
    "an alternative approach for short - term prediction of the wave field is based on numerically solving the so - called envelope equations , which approximate the evolution of the wave envelope to a reasonable accuracy  @xcite . while less expensive than the full hydrodynamic equations , solving the envelope equations is still computationally formidable for real - time forecast of extreme waves .    as a result",
    ", several attempts have been made to devise reliable , reduced - order methods for short - time forecast of water wave evolution .",
    "@xcite , for instance , approximate nonlinear evolution of localized wave groups with an exact breather solution of the linear schr \" odinger equation . to account for the nonlinear effects , they allow the parameters of the breather solution to vary in time such that particular invariants ( energy and the hamiltonian ) of the nonlinear schr \" odinger equation ( nls ) are preserved over time .",
    "@xcite takes a similar approach by substituting a gaussian ansatz into the lagrangian functional associated with the nls equation .",
    "the time evolution of the parameters are determined such that the solution satisfies a least - action principle .",
    "the resulting wave groups from @xcite and @xcite may not necessarily satisfy the underlying envelope equation ( i.e. , the nls equation ) .",
    "most importantly , these approaches rely heavily on the variational ( or hamiltonian ) structure of the nls equation . as such , they are not applicable to the more realistic , higher - order envelope equations , such as the modified nls ( mnls ) equation of  @xcite , whose variational formulation is unavailable .    to avoid these drawbacks ,  @xcite",
    "take an intermediate approach .",
    "they also consider the evolution of parametric wave groups but allow the wave group to evolve under the full non - linear evolution equation by imposing energy conservation  @xcite .",
    "the analysis resulted in a reduced - order set of nonlinear equations that captures the nonlinear dynamics of wave groups and most critically their transition from defocusing to focusing .",
    "this reduced - order model which represents information for the dynamics of the wave groups is combined with a probabilistic analysis of the possible wave groups that can form stochastically for a given wave spectrum .",
    "note that stochasticity is inevitably introduced due to the ` mixing ' occurring between harmonics that propagate with different speeds due to dispersion .",
    "the resulted schemes provide a parsimonious and robust prediction scheme for unidirectional water waves .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to extend the framework of  @xcite from their unidirectional context to multidirectional water waves .",
    "several new challenges arise in this context that are absent in the unidirectional case . in the following section we review these challenges ,",
    "summarize our framework and state the assumptions under which this reduced - order framework is applicable .",
    "we seek to approximate the future spatiotemporal maximum wave height of a measured wave field by decomposing the field as the superposition of wave groups with simple shapes .",
    "the evolution of the simple wave groups are precomputed and stored , so that the prediction reduces essentially to an interpolation from an existing data set .",
    "this reduced - order approach can be divided into the following steps :    a.   evolution of elementary wave groups .",
    "b.   decomposition of random wave fields . c.   prediction of amplitude growth .",
    "* step i. * we consider spatially localized simple wave groups that can be expressed analytically and refer to them as _ elementary wave groups _",
    "( ewg ) . in this paper",
    "we will use ewg with a gaussian profile .",
    "one can alternatively use other shapes such as the secant hyperbolic used in  @xcite .",
    "the key requirement is that the ewg must be completely determined with only a few parameters . a gaussian wave group , for instance ,",
    "is determined by its amplitude ( @xmath0 ) , its longitudinal and transverse widths ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and its orientation ( @xmath3 ) with respect to a global reference frame ( see figure  [ fig : gwg ] ) .",
    "working with the gaussian is also convenient since its derivatives with respect to parameters and variables take a simple form .        for a realistic range of these parameters , we evolve the corresponding elementary wave groups for @xmath4 time units by numerically solving an appropriate wave envelope equation ( see section  [ sec : env ] ) .",
    "we record the spatiotemporal maximum amplitude @xmath5 that each ewg reaches over the time interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "this step is computationally expensive but is carried out only once .",
    "the resulting maximal amplitude is stored as a function of the parameters , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "this step is carried out in section  [ sec : ewg ] .",
    "* step ii . *",
    "given a measured wave field , we approximate its envelope as a superposition of the elementary wave groups . to this end ,",
    "the initially unknown positions , amplitudes and length scales of the elementary wave groups need to be determined such that their superposition provides a reasonable approximation of the measured wave field . in section  [ sec : decomp ] , we devise a dynamical systems - based method that determines the unknown parameters at a reasonable computational cost .",
    "* step iii .",
    "* once the measured wave field is decomposed into ewgs , its maximal future amplitude can be approximated by simply evaluating the precomputed function @xmath7 for each set of ewg parameters @xmath8 .",
    "+ the above approach implicitly assumes that rogue waves form from individual wave groups through modulation instability  @xcite ; a mechanism that has been observed in numerical simulations and in experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is known from linear random wave theory that rogue waves can also form due to the constructive interference of small - amplitude wave packets  @xcite , especially for the case of short crested waves where modulation instability is not very pronounced .",
    "the probability of a rogue wave occurring through this linear mechanism , however , is orders of magnitude smaller than the ones generated through modulation instability  @xcite .",
    "we therefore neglect the rogue waves formed from superposition of smaller waves , and focus on the modulation instability of individual wave groups .    also implicit in our approach",
    "is the assumption that the wave groups constructing a wave field have negligible interactions over the time interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "this is of course not the case for large @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite find , however , that for intermediate time scales ( 10 - 40 wave periods ) and for unidirectional waves this assumption is reasonable .",
    "we come to a similar conclusion for the two - dimensional surface waves considered here ( see section  [ sec : predict ] ) .",
    "to the first order , the modulations of a wave train with characteristic wave vector @xmath9 and frequency @xmath10 can be written as @xmath11 + \\mbox{c.c.},$ ] where @xmath12 is the complex valued envelope for the modulation of the wave and c.c .",
    "is shorthand for complex conjugate terms . assuming that the modulations are slowly varying ( compared to the carrier wave )",
    ", one can derive an equation for the envelope @xmath12 of the free surface height @xmath13 .    as shown by  @xcite , for deep water",
    ", the most general form of the envelope equation can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the nonlinear terms to be discussed shortly .",
    "the integral term is the exact form of the linear dispersion .",
    "the frequency @xmath16 can be expanded in taylor series around wavenumber @xmath9 . truncating the series , and accordingly the nonlinear term @xmath15 , one obtains various approximate equations for the envelope @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , truncating the series at the second order and keeping the simplest cubic nonlinearity , one obtains the nonlinear schr \" odinger ( nls ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the nls equation is only valid for wave spectra with a narrow bandwidth . to relax this limitation ,  @xcite derived the modified nonlinear schr \" odinger ( mnls ) equation by including higher - order terms in the truncation of  .",
    "rotating the spatial coordinate system @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , and normalizing the space and time variables as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the mnls equations reads @xmath21 where the last term involving the velocity potential is defined , using the fourier transform @xmath22 , as @xmath23,\\ ] ] with @xmath24 being the wave vector .",
    "the narrow bandwidth constraint can be further improved by including even more linear and nonlinear terms from equation   to obtain the broad - band mnls ( bmnls ) equation  @xcite . for the time",
    "scales considered here , however , the mnls equation   provides an adequate model of gravity waves in deep ocean  @xcite .",
    "we numerically integrate the mnls equation   on a finite two - dimensional domain @xmath25\\times [ 0,\\ell_y]$ ] with periodic boundary conditions ( see figure  [ fig : domain ] ) .",
    "we set the domain size @xmath26 ( @xmath27 characteristic wavelength ) . as is discussed in section  [ sec : ewg ]",
    ", wave groups which are elongated transverse to the propagation direction have a better chance to give rise to rogue waves .",
    "the rectangular computational domain with a larger transverse dimension ( @xmath28 ) is considered here in order to allow for several of these wave packets to fit in the domain .",
    "the right - hand side of the mnls equation is evaluated using a standard pseudo - spectral method , where the derivatives are computed in the fourier domain and the nonlinear terms are computed in the physical domain .",
    "the temporal integration of the equations are carried out by a fourth - order runge ",
    "kutta exponential time differencing ( etd4rk ) scheme  @xcite .",
    "this method treats the linear part of the mnls equation exactly , and uses the runge ",
    "kutta scheme for the evolution of the nonlinear terms . in the following computations , we use @xmath29 fourier modes to approximate the envelope @xmath30 .",

    "note that , for simplicity , we set the orientation angle of the group @xmath3 to zero ( see figure  [ fig : gwg ] ) .",

    "both groups have the same longitudinal width @xmath36 and amplitude @xmath35 . over time",
    ", the amplitude of the wave group with @xmath34 decays monotonically and its lateral width grows slightly .",
    "the broader wave group with @xmath37 , however , undergoes focusing , whereby its amplitude increases and its longitudinal width decreases slightly . at later times",
    "@xmath39 , the amplitude of this wave group decays eventually .",
    "if instead of the initial amplitude @xmath35 , we choose a smaller amplitude ( say @xmath40 ) , the gaussian ewg with @xmath36 and @xmath37 would not undergo amplitude growth either .",
    "these observations indicate that the focusing ( or defocusing ) of gaussian ewgs depends non - trivially on all three parameters @xmath38 . @xcite",

    "the elementary wave groups corresponding to the points below this surface do not undergo amplitude growth , while the points above the surface do .",
    "in other words , the displayed hypersurface forms the instability boundary for the ewgs in the parameter space @xmath38 .    figure  [ fig : instboundary](a ) shows that the amplitudes of the ewgs with very small width in @xmath32 or in @xmath33 do not increase .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath51 or @xmath52 , the ewg s amplitude decays , irrespective of the initial amplitude @xmath0 . as it has been shown for unidirectional waves @xcite , this is a direct consequence of the scale - invariance braking due to the additional terms of mnls ( compared with nls ) .",
    "here we observe the corresponding result for two - dimensional waves . for larger values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the amplitude growth ( or lack thereof )",
    "depends on the initial amplitude . if the initial amplitude is too small ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) , the wave amplitude will not grow at later times , irrespective of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "but if the initial amplitude exceeds a threshold ( depending on @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) we observe an amplitude growth .    .",

    "we observe that the iso - suface @xmath59 coincides with the surface @xmath40 .",
    "this indicates that , regardless of the initial withs @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the amplitude of the ewgs decay if the initial amplitude is small enough .",

    ", we first need to approximate the random wave fields as a superposition of gaussian ewgs .",

    ", it remains to determine the width parameters @xmath73 of the gaussian profiles . to this end , we use the following optimization step . given the envelope @xmath61 , we define the function @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the superposition of gaussian wave groups   to be determined .",
    "the global minimizer of the function @xmath76 returns the best gaussian approximation to the envelope @xmath61 .",
    "we evaluate the minimizers of the above functional by devising an appropriate fictitious - time dynamical system as described in section  [ app : lengthdetect ] .",
    "but first we need to locate the peaks @xmath77 .",
    "there are several methods for detection of local maxima of a two - dimensional surface  @xcite . here , we approximate the local maxima of the envelope @xmath61 by simply comparing the nearest neighbors on the given computational grid . on a rectangular grid , we declare a grid point a local maximum if the value of the envelope is larger than its eight immediate neighbors . for our purposes",
    "this rudimentary method returns satisfactory results and avoids the computational cost of more high - end peak detection algorithms .    before applying this peak detection algorithm ,",
    "however , we apply a low - pass filter to the measured envelope @xmath61 .",
    "this filter is not an ad hoc smoothing ; it is rather motivated by the observations made in section  [ sec : ewg ] . recall that wave groups with lengths scales @xmath51 or @xmath52 decay regardless of their initial amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "since our purpose is to predict the growth of wave groups , we can safely neglect such small scale wave groups . given this observation , therefore , we discard harmonics whose wavenumber @xmath78 satisfy @xmath79 note that , given the domain size @xmath80 , these wave numbers correspond to decaying wave groups with @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "this physically - motivated smoothing has two advantages .",
    "first , it speeds up the computations by removing many irrelevant , small - scale peaks from the envelope .",
    "second , as we further discuss in section  [ sec : noise ] , it makes our group detection method robust to measurement noise .",
    "once the peaks are detected , it remains to find the optimal set of length scales @xmath73 that minimizes the function @xmath81 defined in  .",
    "here , we devise a dynamical systems - based method that can efficiently find these minimizers . the idea is to evolve @xmath82 and @xmath83 along the fictitious time @xmath84 such that the functional @xmath85 decreases monotonically as @xmath84 increases . differentiating with respect to the fictitious time @xmath84",
    ", we obtain @xmath86 where @xmath87     and that @xmath88 is a multivariable function . ]",
    "we choose the fictitious - time derivatives @xmath89 and @xmath90 such that @xmath91 is monotonically decreasing .",
    "a trivial choice achieving this goal is @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "the schematic figure  [ fig : lode ] shows the geometry of the function @xmath94 and a trajectory of the ode  . in reality , the graph of @xmath94 is much more complex with several local minima as opposed to one global minimum depicted here .",
    "if the ode is solved from an initial condition @xmath95 far from the global minimum , the trajectory will most likely converge to a local minimum of the function @xmath94 which could potentially result in an unsatisfactory approximation of the wave envelope .",
    "therefore , it is important that the initial conditions @xmath95 are chosen carefully . here , we choose these initial conditions such that the second order partial derivative of the gaussian wave group @xmath96 evaluated at the corresponding peak @xmath77 coincides with the second order partial derivative of the measured envelope @xmath61 at that peak . more precisely , we choose @xmath97 such that    @xmath98    @xmath99    [ eq : l0 ]    the derivatives of the measured envelope @xmath100 are approximated numerically by finite differences while the derivative of @xmath64 are known analytically .",
    "note that the value of the gaussian @xmath64 at the peak @xmath101 is independent of the length scales @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , the first - order partial derivatives of @xmath64 vanish at the peaks and therefore are independent of the length scales @xmath102 .",
    "the lowest - order derivatives that depend on the length scales are the second - order derivatives .",
    "that is our motivation for using these derivatives to obtain good initial conditions @xmath97 .",
    "this choice of the initial conditions results in a reasonable approximation of the wave envelope @xmath61 such that all the envelopes reported in section  [ sec : predict ] below are reconstructed with relative error , @xmath103 smaller than @xmath104 .    in order to evolve the ode",
    ", we use adaptive time stepping where the time step @xmath105 is adjusted adaptively to ensure that the relative error @xmath106 decreases after each time step .",
    "we elaborate this adaptive time stepping in algorithm  [ alg : groupdetect ] where our wave group detection is summarized .",

    "the noise @xmath120 , which is correlated in space , is obtained from a slowly decaying gaussian spectrum with random phase .",

    "the reconstructed wave fields have relative errors lower than @xmath124 which is quite satisfactory given the fact that the wave gauges measure the surface elevation within @xmath104 error to begin with  @xcite .",
    "the robustness of our wave field decomposition can be attributed to two features of the method .",
    "firstly , the low pass filter discussed in section  [ app : peakdetect ] results in a relatively smooth surface by removing the small scale fluctuations in the wave field ( see figure  [ fig : groupdet_noise](b ) ) .",
    "as observed in section  [ sec : ewg ] ( cf . figure  [ fig : instboundary ] ) , whether these small scale fluctuations are attributed to noise or are genuine features of the wave field , they will not develop into rogue waves and they will not influence larger wave groups on their future evolution .",
    "therefore , in the context of rogue wave detection , this low pass filter is justified .",
    "the second reason for the robustness of our method is the spatial average taken in the cost function  . as a result ,",
    "the right - hand side of the odes   involves an integral over space with an exponential kernel .",
    "this averaging adds an extra level of smoothing to our method .",
    "as opposed to the low pass filter , this smoothing is not applied directly to the measured wave field @xmath100 ; it is instead embedded in the minimization method itself .",

    ", rogue waves most likely develop from wave groups whose length scales are @xmath166 and their amplitude are larger than or equal to @xmath169 .",
    "roughly speaking , this means that the wave groups with length scales @xmath166 and amplitudes larger than @xmath169 are the ` most dangerous ' both in terms of dynamics ( i.e. they tend to evolve to rogue waves ) but also in terms of probability of occurrence .    the critical values @xmath171 are listed in table  [ tab : stats ] for each wave spectrum .",

    "large waves form as a result of the dispersive mixing of smaller wave groups and the subsequent focusing due to nonlinear effects . here",
    "we provide an analysis that follows a similar philosophy .",
    "specifically , we first develop a wave field decomposition algorithm that robustly and efficiently represents a wave field as a discrete set of elementary wave groups ( ewgs ) with gaussian profiles .",
    "we then utilize the governing envelope equations to quantify the the evolution of each of those elementary wave groups .    the combination of the wave field decomposition algorithm , which provides information about the statistics of the system ( caused by the dispersive mixing of harmonics ) , and the precomputed map for the expected wave group elevation , which encodes dynamical information for focusing phenomena , allows ( i ) for the understanding of how the probability of occurrence of rogue waves changes as the spectrum parameters vary , ( ii ) the computation of a critical lengthscale characterizing wave groups with high probability of evolving to rogue waves , and ( iii ) the formulation of a robust and parsimonious reduced - order prediction scheme for large waves .",
    "specifically , the ewg decomposition combined with the precomputed map provides information that complements the usual spectral analysis of the wave field , when it comes to large waves .",
    "for instance , it has been reported that the frequency of rogue wave occurrence is decreasing as the spreading angle increases .",
    "our ewg analysis reveals that larger spreading angles lead to wave groups whose width in the transverse direction , @xmath2 , tends to be smaller .",
    "this has a direct interpretation in terms of the probability of occurrence of rogue waves .    through the same analysis we also identified a critical lengths scale for each direction @xmath166 and a critical amplitude @xmath169 associated with rogue waves . for each wave spectrum",
    "these are the most likely combination of scales and amplitudes that will eventually grow into a rogue wave .",
    "we found that the conditional probability of the critical length scales @xmath166 is directly related to the frequency of rogue wave occurrence .",
    "regarding the prediction scheme we showed , through extensive direct numerical simulations of the modified nonlinear schr \" odinger ( mnls ) equation , that the proposed reduced - order method is capable of predicting the future wave height with less than @xmath104 relative error and a rogue - wave - prediction time window between @xmath180 and @xmath181 wave periods .",
    "the scheme is orders of magnitude less expensive compared with direct simulation methods and it is very robust with respect to measurement noise , which is inevitable in any realistic setting .",
    "our work can be extended in several directions .",
    "an important direction is the case of crossing seas where wave groups can carry more than one dominant wavenumber .",
    "other scenarios where our analysis can be extended in a straightforward manner is the case of wave - current interaction and finite bathymetry . for such cases",
    "we expect that the stability and response surfaces will be modified in order to take into account the additional effect . in such cases",
    ", envelope equations may not be the best approach to characterize the dynamics of ewgs and more direct methods should be utilized .",
    "clearly an important step forward is the experimental validation of the proposed scheme and we currently work towards this direction .",
    "the proposed approach provides an important paradigm of how the combination of dynamics and statistics can lead to better understanding of the system properties .",
