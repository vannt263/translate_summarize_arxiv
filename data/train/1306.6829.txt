    "the real - space renormalization group ( rg ) is an efficient numerical method for analysis of quantum / classical lattice systems  @xcite .",
    "a main goal of the numerical rg is to extract a small number of relevant degrees of freedom , which well describe the physical properties of the `` target state '' , such as a correlated groundstate or a thermal equilibrium state , in the hilbert space of huge dimension . recently",
    "a number of real - space rg formulations refer to the entanglement between the system and the environment , for the purpose of keeping relevant degrees of freedom systematically .",
    "a typical example is the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , which has been a powerful computational tool for one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems and two - dimensional ( 2d ) classical ones  @xcite . in dmrg ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is implicitly maximized by means of the singular - value decomposition assisted by the diagonalization of the reduced density matrix  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that when a gapped groundstate is targeted , the spectrum of the reduced density matrix in the bulk limit is well described by the eigenvalue distribution of baxter s corner transfer matrix ( ctm )  @xcite .    as a higher dimensional extension of dmrg ,",
    "a corner transfer tensor approach was firstly formulated for the 3d ising model represented as a 3d vertex model  @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , suffers from a slow decay in eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , where the target scheme in the rg transformation was not appropriate from the modern view point .",
    "complementary direct variational approaches based on the 2d tensor product state@xcite , or the 2d projected entangled pair state@xcite has been applied to the higher - dimensional problems .",
    "recently , xie _ et al_. proposed an improved tensor rg method@xcite combined with the higher order singular value decomposition ( hosvd )  @xcite , which has been abbreviated as hotrg  @xcite .",
    "they precisely estimated the critical temperature and scaling exponents for 3d classical systems and 2d quantum systems .",
    "moreover , a further improvement of the tensor rg can be achieved by the second renormalization group  @xcite , but numerical cost for this improvement is relatively high .    in hotrg ,",
    "the effective tensors representing the renormalized boltzmann weights are directly constructed by the tensor decomposition , while the second renormalization takes account of the entanglement between the system and the environment .",
    "thus , we may expect that these two tensor rg methods involve essentially different theoretical backgrounds in some sense . in hotrg , however , the role of the entanglement has not been discussed yet , because its rg transformation does not explicitly refer to the entanglement between the system and the environment . in this paper , we thus clarify the role of the entanglement in hotrg for the 2d classical models , where we can refer various exact results of the integrable systems and conformal field theory(cft ) .",
    "note that the observation of the 2d classical models is also relevant to 1d quantum systems , through the well - known quantum - classical correspondence  @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy at criticality .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the hotrg for 2d vertex models on the square lattice . in sec .",
    "[ fp ] , we discuss the structure of the renormalized vertex weight at the fixed point , on the basis of the corner double line ( cdl ) picture  @xcite . in particular , we show that the entanglement spectrum of the reduced density matrix is represented by ` doubling ' of the ctm spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ des ] , the numerical evidence of the cdl picture is shown in the off - critical region of the 2d classical ising model . in sec .",
    "v , the finite size behaviors of the free energy and the entanglement entropy at the criticality are also investigated .",
    "in addition , we analyze the scaling of the effective correlation length with respect to the cut - off dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary .",
    "let us consider a 2d classical vertex model on the square lattice , where a local vertex weight is represented as a 4-leg tensor @xmath2 .",
    "the indices @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 respectively correspond to link variables in the horizontal and vertical directions , as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] . throughout this article",
    "we consider the 2-state vertex model , typically @xmath7 , etc . , and assume the symmetry where @xmath8 is invariant under the permutation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for the purpose of simplifying the formulations .    in order to capture the feature of the tensor renormalization group , we start with a system , which consists of @xmath9 vertices connected in the geometry of a square area with a set of specified boundary configurations",
    ". consider the case where the link variables at the bottom and the top boundaries of the area , respectively , are fixed as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and those at the left and the right boundaries as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as is depicted in fig .",
    "we put subscript `` @xmath14 '' on the composite link variables , for the later convenience .",
    "multiplying all the vertex weights in the area and taking configuration sum for those links connecting the neighboring vertices in the bulk region , we obtain the partition function @xmath15 under the specified boundary configurations @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we have used the letter `` @xmath8 '' , rather than `` @xmath20 '' , for the partition function , since it is possible to interpret @xmath15 as a kind of vertex weight , where each index has @xmath21-degrees of freedom .",
    "hereafter , we consider the case where the linear dimension @xmath22 is chosen to be @xmath23 , and explicitly show the system size by putting the number on the tensor as @xmath24 .",
    "it is possible to extend the area of the lattice by joining two vertices .",
    "for example , let us put @xmath25 on top of @xmath26 and contracting the vertical link .",
    "we then obtain a composit tensor @xmath27 which corresponds to the @xmath28 area on the lattice .",
    "representing the index pairs @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , as joined link variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the tensor @xmath33 can also be considered as an extended vertex weight @xmath34 . in the same manner ,",
    "we can align two @xmath33 horizontally and contracting the joint indices , as we have done in the above equation , we obtain a wider extended weight @xmath35 , which corresponds to the @xmath36 area on the lattice . thus starting from the original vertex weight @xmath37 , one can define @xmath38 for arbitrary @xmath39 .    from the computational view point , there is a strong limitation on the maximal value of @xmath39 , which specifies the system size @xmath40 , since the dimension of each index of @xmath38 is @xmath21 .",
    "thus the numerical storage of the order of @xmath41 is required if one keeps @xmath38 faithfully . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "the hosvd is introduced in the formulation of the hotrg , and each tensor is _ compressed _ to that of smaller dimensions  @xcite .",
    "suppose that we have reached a maximum @xmath39 , where we can generate @xmath33 but can not store the all tensor elements of @xmath42 .",
    "following the standard procedure in hosvd proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] , let us introduce a kind of density matrix @xmath43 figure [ fig3 ] exhibits the schematic picture of @xmath44 ; sewing three edges of two @xmath33 , we obtain the _ reduced _ density matrix with respect to the pair of indices @xmath45 and @xmath30 . the rg transformation matrix is then constructed from the diagonalization @xmath46 where the eigenvalue matrix @xmath47 the entanglement spectrum in hotrg is positive definite , and where @xmath48 is the corresponding orthogonal matrix  @xcite . let us assume that the diagonal elements @xmath49 of @xmath47 are aligned in the decreasing order . normally , the decay in @xmath49 with respect to @xmath50 is rapid enough , and it is possible to discard tiny eigenvalues @xmath51 .",
    "we thus retain @xmath1 numbers of relevant eigenvalues in accordance with the standard dmrg scheme .",
    "after the restriction @xmath52 , the orthogonal matrix @xmath53 can be regarded as a rg transformation .",

    "we then obtain the renormalized vertex tensor @xmath55 , which has two renormalized indices @xmath50 and @xmath56 .",
    "using @xmath33 , we can join two of them horizontally , as we have done in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , to obtain @xmath42 , which is an extended tensor whose linear dimension is @xmath57 . creating the density matrix for the vertical links and performing the rg transformation again ,",
    "we obtain a renormalized vertex tensor @xmath58 . such a process of system extension and rg transformation can be repeated for arbitrary times , within a practical computational time .",
    "it is expected that , as @xmath39 increases , the renormalized tensor @xmath38 approaches to that of the thermodynamic limit , @xmath59 .    throughout this article",
    "we use alphabetical indices , such as @xmath60 and @xmath61 for row / column of the original link variables , and greek letters , such as @xmath50 and @xmath62 , for the renormalized link variable whose degrees of freedom is @xmath1 at most .",
    "we often abbreviate indices , such as @xmath38 , if the distinction between renormalized and unrenormalized tensors is apparent .",
    "in addition , we note that the partition function per site can be obtained in terms of normalization coefficients of renormalized vertex tensor @xmath38 . in order to avoid an explosion of the overall normalization of @xmath38 , it is useful to impose the normalization @xmath63 for every iteration step .",
    "practically , we calculate a normalization coefficient , @xmath64 and then replace @xmath65 .",
    "also , we define @xmath66 and replace @xmath67 . for a given iteration number @xmath39 , then , the partition function for the @xmath9(@xmath40 ) system can be expressed as @xmath68 , where traces of the unnormalized vertex are taken in both of the vertical and horizontal directions , respectively .",
    "note that the geometry of this partition function corresponds to a torus .",
    "we can thus calculate the logarithm of the partition function per site as @xmath69 the accuracy of the approximation is determined by the truncation error @xmath70 .",
    "let us consider the fixed point of the hotrg method in the off - critical regime , where the correlation length of the system is finite . recall that the spatial width of the renormalized vertex tensor @xmath38 increases exponentially with respect to the number of extension @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that @xmath22 exceeds the correlation length of the system @xmath71 above a certain number of iterations @xmath39 , and finally @xmath72 is satisfied at the fixed point .",
    "then the link variables corresponding to the two parallel edges of @xmath38 are spatially separated away beyond @xmath71 , where the entanglement between them is negligible .",
    "similarly , it can be expected that the link variables around different corners become disentangled with each other . in this sense",
    ", the renormalized vertex tensor at the fixed point @xmath59 can be decoupled into four patches .",
    "when such a decoupling scheme is realized , the vertex tensor is mentioned as the corner double - line ( cdl ) tensor  @xcite .    for the unnormalized fixed - point vertex tensor @xmath59",
    ", there is a remaining entanglement in the two adjacent edges around each corner , because the distance between them is independent of the system size @xmath22 .",
    "an essential point is that this entanglement around each corner is the same as that of the baxter s ctm .",
    "thus it is expected that the unnormalized fixed - point vertex tensor can be decomposed as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a normalized ctm having the sub - link variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the effective dimension @xmath77 .",

    "it is , however , possible to extract the picture theoretically , by considering matrix product states ( mps ) that surround an unrenormalized tensor @xmath85 .",

    "[ rank ] , where the cdl decoupling effectively occurs .",
    "one may afraid that this reduction of the effective dimension might possibly induces a redunction of the entanglement entropy in @xmath215 . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ ent_ent_tc_finite_l ] , however , @xmath194 is approximately non - decreasing function of @xmath22 , and is saturated toward a fixed point value .",
    "this suggests that , at the critical point , the crossover behavior around @xmath216 is responsible for a decoupling of the tensor @xmath38 to ctms containing a nontrivial effective length scale .    in order to analyze the cdl property at @xmath168 in detail ,",
    "we present the entanglement spectrum with @xmath161 after the numerical convergence , in fig .",

    "[ appndxb1 ] is that the entanglement spectrum @xmath220(plus symbols ) and the doubling spectrum of @xmath219(circles ) exhibit the correspondence @xmath221_{\\mu }   \\ , \\right)^{0.294}_{~ } \\ , , \\label{esattc}\\ ] ] with the nontrivial power .",
    "this fact shows that the entanglement spectrum of hotrg at @xmath168 in the region @xmath222 deviates from a naive expectation , @xmath223 , although the cdl picture holds for @xmath222 even at @xmath168 .",
    "in particular , the power 0.294 indicates that the htorg spectrum maintains more entanglement than the ctmrg with @xmath224 .    as is in the mps variational formulation of the 1d transverse field ising model  @xcite",
    ", we have confirmed that the correlation length at the fixed point of ctmrg scales as @xmath225 , where @xmath218 is the number of block spin state kept in the ctmrg@xcite .",
    "thus , we may expect that the doubling of the ctm spectrum in hotrg would draw the length scale @xmath226 .",
    "however , the numerical result of eq .",
    "( [ esattc ] ) indicates that the effective length scale at the hotrg fixed point has much longer length scale than the naive expectation @xmath227 .",
    "indeed , the entanglement entropy holds the value acquired in the region @xmath200 , even after @xmath222 .",
    "thus it is concluded that the fixed point of hotrg retains the scale of order of @xmath228 , although the fixed - point vertex weight collapses to the tensor well described by the cdl picture . at the present stage",
    ", however , it is difficult to clarify the detailed mechanism of such nontrivial cdl behavior of the vertex tensor .",
    "we have studied the structure of the entanglement spectrum in hotrg for the 2d classical vertex model . in the off - critical region , we have clarified that the spectrum at the fixed point , where the renormalized tensor converges , is described by the doubling of the ctm spectrum having the effective dimension @xmath77 .",
    "this is in accordance with the cdl decoupling picture in the renormalized vertex tensor , as was discussed in the tensor rgs  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the matrix ranks in the reduced density matrix and the transfer matrix also confirms the cdl picture .",
    "moreover , the same doubling of the entanglement spectrum is verified for the groundstate of the 1d transverse field ising model in the off - critical region .",
    "we have also investigated the finite-@xmath1 scaling at the criticality , where the cutoff @xmath1 introduces an effective length scale @xmath169 . for the 2d ising model , we confirmed @xmath229 with @xmath187 in the free energy level , where the exponent @xmath230 is determined within the range @xmath200 .",
    "also , @xmath230 is consistent with the finite-@xmath188 scaling of the mps variational method for the 1d quantum ising model at the critical point  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite-@xmath1 scaling applied to the entanglement entropy suggests a nontrivial exponent @xmath231 , although the numerical result shows the cdl decoupling of the vertex tensors .",
    "a reason for the discrepancy of @xmath232 is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum is described by the doubling of the ctm spectrum with the nontrivial power , as in eq .",
    "( [ esattc ] ) .",
    "then , a key point is that , at the critical point , geometry of the reduced density matrix may affect the structure of the effective fixed point of hotrg , because the hotrg algorithm accumulates deviations originating from the geometry during iterations .",
    "for example , the geometry of the wavefunction in the mps variation for the 1d quantum system@xcite is the half - infinite cylinder , while that of eq .",
    "( [ rdm ] ) is a finite size cluster where one end of the cylinder is bound off .",
    "we think that this difference of the geometry is a possible reason for the nontrivial exponent @xmath233 of hotrg . a similar geometrical effect is also expected for the hotrg - like algorithm for the 1d quantum system , which was described in appendix b , at the criticality .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to leave the detailed analysis as a future issue .    in this article",
    ", we have not considered the second renormalization group , which takes account of the entanglement between the vertex weight and surrounding environment .",
    "in contrast to hotrg , the reduced density matrix in the second renormalization does not undergo the reduction of the matrix rank , which is a possible reason for the improvement of the accuracy in the second renormalization .",
    "also , we have not discussed hotrg in higher dimensions . we can expect that the renormalized tensor is described by `` corner transfer tensor '' in the fixed point level .",
    "however , the nature of the spectrum of the corner transfer tensor is not well - understand .",
    "for further analysis of hosrg / trg , it may be interesting issue to discuss the network structure of the tensors .",

    "ii , the matrix rank of the reduced density matrix ( [ rdm ] ) is expected to crossover from @xmath213 to @xmath1 , reflecting the cdl decoupling . in fig .",
    "[ rank ] , thus , we plot the rank of @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ rdm ] ) as a function of the system length @xmath192 , where the maximum dimension of the renormalized vertex tensor is @xmath236 . in the figure ,",
    "a numerical threshold for judging the zero eigenvalue is @xmath237 .",
    "in the region of @xmath238 , the tensor dimension increases exponentially without any cutoff of the tensors . for @xmath239 , the rank of @xmath47",
    "rapidly collapses , as @xmath22 increases beyond the correlation length of the system .",
    "indeed , the rank of @xmath47 becomes stable for @xmath240 .",
    "however , it should be remark that this value of the rank is @xmath241 rather than @xmath1 .",
    "this is because the all spectra below @xmath206 has the trivial double degeneracy associated with the @xmath242 symmetry . as @xmath39 further increases , the @xmath242 symmetry of the spectrum is spontaneously broken around @xmath243 , triggered by the numerical error .",
    "then , the rank of @xmath47 finally arrives at @xmath1 , which indicates the proper cdl fixed point with the broken @xmath242 symmetry .",
    "we thus confirmed the cdl decoupling at the off - critical region .    at @xmath244 ,",
    "the correlation length is intrinsically infinite .",
    "accordingly , the rank of @xmath47 maintains @xmath213 in the region of @xmath245 . as was mentioned in sec .",
    "iv , however , a finite @xmath1 introduces an effective correlation length , and , as @xmath22 increases beyond it , the cdl decoupling may occur . in the region of @xmath246",
    ", it can be actually seen that the rank of @xmath47 drastically collapse to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we have also confirmed the decoupling scheme of eq .",

    ", we remark that the relation between the hamiltonian and the wavefunction @xmath261 is quite reminiscent of eq .",
    "( [ tm_eq ] ) for the 2d vertex model .",
    "thus , @xmath261 in the quantum systems approximately corresponds to @xmath262 in the hotrg for 2d classical vertex model .",
    "we divide the groundstate wave function of the total system into two blocks containing @xmath263 sites . assuming the parity symmetry , we then perform svd as @xmath264 , where @xmath265 is an unitary matrix containing singular vectors and @xmath266 is a diagonal matrix containing nonnegative singular values .",
    "we can use @xmath265 as the rg transformation in the spatial direction for the hamiltonian , namely @xmath267 thus , we can formulate a recursive numerical rg algorithm for the 1d quantum system similar to hotrg . repeating iterations , we obtain the singular values at the fixed point , which we refer to as @xmath268 .    particularly for the integrable model ,",
