    "accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics and play an essential part in the formation of stars and galaxies . for accretion through a disk to be effective , angular momentum must be transported radially outwards , allowing material to move radially inwards .",
    "one means of achieving this is through viscous torques @xcite , and considerable progress has been made using the phenomenological @xmath2-viscosity introduced by @xcite which assumes that viscosity is provided by turbulent stresses which scale with the gas pressure . however , despite its successes , the @xmath2-viscosity model provides little physical insight into the mechanism(s ) responsible for the turbulent stress .    even prior to the work of @xcite",
    ", instabilities in magnetized rotating plasmas had been discovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "yet , it was not until the seminal work of @xcite that the so - called magnetorotational instability ( mri ) received widespread attention as the agent responsible for the onset of accretion disk turbulence .",
    "linear stability analysis has shown that the mri will amplify a seed magnetic field indefinitely until confronted by the strong - field limit or the diffusion scale @xcite .",
    "non - linear stability analysis finds that growth of the magnetic field by the linear phase of the mri is likely to be truncated by saturation resulting from secondary , or parasitic , instabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that saturation of the magnetic field occurs was clearly demonstrated by even the very first shearing box simulations @xcite .    contemplating the next steps in magnetized disks studies",
    "is aided by summarising what we have already learned .",
    "for example , as mentioned above , it is clear that the magnetic field reaches saturation and that the resulting maxwell stress dominates the angular momentum transport . in numerical simulations",
    "this necessitates high resolution to ensure that the fastest growing mri modes are sufficiently well resolved ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "related to this point is the importance of stratification , which introduces a characteristic length scale , removing the problem of non - convergence with simulation resolution encountered in unstratified simulations @xcite .",
    "stratification could also play a role in the dynamo process which sets the saturation stress @xcite .",
    "however , the shearing box approximation used in a large number of numerical studies to - date has limitations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the use of shearing - periodic boundary conditions in the radial direction , and/or periodic boundary conditions in the vertical direction .",
    "there boundary conditions artificially trap magnetic flux , assisting the maintenance of the turbulent dynamo and obscuring the dependence of the saturated state on resolution .",
    "this is supported by a comparison of periodic and open boundary conditions in global models by @xcite where the former were found to assist the dynamo by preventing magnetic flux from being expelled from the domain . in this regard",
    "global models have the advantage of removing the unphysical influence of the shearing box boundary conditions , albeit at a much larger computational expense .",
    "other motivations for global models are the results from stability analyses of non - axisymmetric disturbances in magnetized accretion disks , where the most robust mri modes are localized and the most robust buoyant ( parker ) modes are global @xcite .",
    "therefore , large radial extents are required to accommodate the more global modes , and in this regard there is a limit to the radial periodicity adopted in most shearing box simulations .",
    "these factors point to the need for high resolution , global , stratified disk simulations to further unravel the complexities of magnetorotational turbulence .    of the global simulation studies that have been performed a large number of the findings from local models have been maintained or have persisted ; the ratio of the maxwell and reynolds stress is @xmath3 , and variations in toroidal magnetic field with time are suggestive of a dynamo cycle @xcite .",
    "however , a large number of these simulations do not start from fully equilibrium initial conditions where the magnetic field is accounted for in the force balance and in the induction equation .",
    "both local and global models started with poloidal fields which do not satisfy the induction equation show rapid disruption and re - arrangement of the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this introduces a transient phase where channel flows are fueled by rapid shearing of the poloidal field lines .",
    "as such , extended run times are required to ensure that transients have subsided . to our knowledge , no previous global simulations of the mri in stratified disks have used a fully equilibrium initial disk ( i.e. satisfying force balance _ and _ the induction equation ) .",
    "we aim to explore the influence of magnetic fields on an accretion disk with global simulations . in this first paper we present equilibrium",
    "initial disk models with arbitrary radial density and temperature profiles .",
    "we then investigate the saturation ( both locally and globally ) of the growth of magnetic field perturbations .",
    "to this end we excite the mri in global simulations using linear mri calculations as a guide , and recover growth of magnetic field perturbations in agreement with estimates . in so doing we show that non - linear gas motions saturate the initial growth of the magnetic field and that at later times the turbulent state retains no knowledge of the initially excited mri mode(s ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in   [ sec : model ] we describe the equilibrium initial conditions and details of the numerical calculations and in ",
    "[ sec : excite ] we perform a linear perturbation analysis for the non - axisymmetric mri .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or are due to the onset of turbulence @xcite propagating radially outwards through the disk is unclear and would require an analysis of the non - linear growth of the non - axisymmetric mri , which we do not pursue here .",
    "+    c +    in summary , comparisons between linear growth calculations and global simulations highlights a number of potential saturation mechanisms .",
    "such as , growth of magnetic field perturbations beyond the weak field limit , and/or growth of the radial wavenumber beyond the finite limit of the simulation resolution .",
    "however , for the simulations performed in this work , we find that saturation of growth in magnetic field perturbations correlates well with the onset of non - linear motions .",
    "a major focus of magnetized accretion disk simulations is to study properties of the quasi - steady - state turbulence .",
    "a necessary test is whether the turbulent steady state depends on the mri mode initially excited , and also whether prohibitive transient behaviour arises due to the choice of exciting a specific mri mode . for this purpose",
    "we have computed model gbl - rand which uses the same initial disk as model gbl-@xmath47 with the difference that the disk is perturbed with random perturbations in the both the poloidal velocity ( amplitude @xmath155 ) and gas pressure ( @xmath156 amplitude ) which excite a range of mri modes .",
    "simulation resolution and time - averaged measures of the turbulent state are listed in tables  [ tab : alg_test ] and [ tab : global_models ] , respectively .",
    "the evolution of model gbl - rand is very similar to that of model gbl-@xmath47 ; the initial perturbations excite the mri and lead to growth of @xmath157 .",
    "both models show similar growth in the @xmath141 , @xmath121 , @xmath143 mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bcomp ] ) which one would expect given that this mode is excited with the same amplitude perturbation .",
    "after @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) values of @xmath157 become almost identical between the models irrespective of the differing initial perturbations .",
    "we illustrate this in figs .  [",
    "fig : kr2d_gbl - m10 + ] and [ fig : kr2d_gbl - rand ] in which we show the evolution of @xmath160 in fourier space for a range of @xmath122 values .",
    "the different panels in the figures correspond to low , moderate , and high wavenumber values for @xmath161 and @xmath121 ( relative to the size of the disk and the nyquist limit ) . as mentioned above , @xmath157 values are very similar between the two models at @xmath162 .",
    "furthermore , even though we excite a specific low wavenumber mode in model gbl-@xmath42 , a wide range of modes rapidly emerge .",
    "we attribute this behaviour to wave - wave coupling and the onset of a turbulent cascade .",
    "exciting larger wavenumbers should provide a larger _ initial _ mri growth rate ( see   [ sec : excite ] ) , but how does this affect the evolution of magnetic field perturbations in the global simulations ?",
    "in particular , does the wavenumber of the excited mri mode affect the globally - averaged saturation stress ?",
    "in model gbl - rand a white noise spectrum of perturbations has been excited .",
    "therefore higher wavenumber modes can contribute to the initial growth phase in @xmath114 .",
    "there is an indication of this from fig .",
    "[ fig : kr2d_gbl - rand ] ) where the growth of @xmath153 at a range of wavenumbers means that the maxwell stress , and consequently @xmath114 will also grow across a range of wavenumbers .",
    "[ fig : global_stress ] shows that @xmath163 does grow faster for gbl - rand compared to gbl-@xmath47 ( which have identical grid resolution ) , supporting the notion that the growth in the globally averaged stress due to an ensemble of unstable modes is higher than for a single wavenumber mode .",
    "all three models start with a toroidal magnetic field with a net flux , and during the early evolution of the disk , the combination of magnetic buoyancy and accretion expels magnetic flux from the disk body such that by the time the turbulent steady state is reached the net toroidal magnetic flux of the disk , @xmath164 is close to zero .",
    "subsequently , @xmath164 oscillates about the zero - point with a period of roughly @xmath165  orbits ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] ) consistent with previous global simulations and suggestive of a dynamo cycle @xcite .",
    "all three models demonstrate this behaviour . however , minor differences in the toroidal magnetic flux , @xmath164 , are visible between models gbl-@xmath47 and gbl - rand ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "the different models are slightly out of phase , which is not surprising given the differences in the transient evolution at early simulation times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : global_stress ] ) .",
    "interestingly , model gbl - rand does not overshoot when expelling the initial net toroidal flux and thus settles into dynamo oscillations at a slightly earlier time , which may explain why the transient phase in @xmath114 takes a longer time to fade in this model .",
    "c +    in conclusion , once the disk reaches a turbulent steady - state the disk retains no knowledge of the mri mode initially excited .",
    "this is supported by the almost identical time - averaged properties of the disk noted in table  [ tab : global_models ] for models perturbed by a single low wavenumber mode or an ensemble of modes .      in this section",
    "we examine the ability of different numerical algorithms to recover the growth of magnetic field perturbations resulting from the non - axisymmetric mri .",
    "comparisons between numerical simulations and analytical estimates for the _ axisymmetric _ mri have been presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "considering that mhd turbulence in accretion disks produces a predominantly toroidal field it is important to examine how well numerical algorithms can recover the growth of @xmath154 as a result of the _ non - axisymmetric _ mri .",
    "the setups used are listed in table  [ tab : alg_test ] .",
    "the different combinations are intended to test different orders of reconstruction , parabolic limiters , and grid resolution .",
    "reconstruction refers to the order of accuracy used to interpolate cell interface values ( which are then used in the riemann solver to calculate fluxes of conserved variables ) .",
    "parabolic limiters are used to preserve monotonicity and prevent extrema from being introduced by the reconstruction step .",
    "we examine the original limiter for ppm proposed by @xcite , the extremum preserving limiters presented by @xcite , and limiters based on reconstruction via characteristic variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the aforementioned slope limiters are respectively denoted `` cw84 '' , `` cs08 '' , and `` char '' in table  [ tab : alg_test ] .",
    "the last parameter we vary is the grid resolution , as this places a constraint on the maximum resolvable wavenumber , and for this purpose we compute models gbl-@xmath42-hr , gbl-@xmath42 , gbl-@xmath42-lr , gbl-@xmath42-llr , and gbl-@xmath42-lllr ( which have decreasing resolution ) . note that with the exception of models gbl-@xmath47 and gbl - rand , all models have the same cell aspect ratio and the same ratio of cells in the disk body to cells in the corona as gbl-@xmath42 .    as in   [ subsec : comp ] , we calculate approximate growth rates of the magnetic field perturbation , @xmath166 for the @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 mode via a fourier analysis of the initial simulation evolution .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : alg_test ] , which we summarise as follows :    * the best agreement with the linear mri growth rate comes from model gbl-@xmath47 , showing that azimuthal resolution is important for properly capturing mri growth . * within errors the choice of limiter does not make a considerable difference to the resulting growth rate . *",
    "linear reconstruction produces a comparable growth rate to parabolic reconstruction .",
    "* there is a consistent trend that growth rates increase with increasing resolution ( see models gbl-@xmath42-lllr , gbl-@xmath42-llr , gbl-@xmath42-lr , gbl-@xmath42 , and gbl-@xmath42-hr ) . with 4 cells/@xmath32 in the @xmath35 direction",
    "the growth rates are converged ( within errors ) for roughly 23 - 35 cells/@xmath32 in the @xmath99 direction .",
    "this is a slightly lower threshold than the @xmath167 cells/@xmath32 ( in the vertical direction ) found to achieve convergence in the time - averaged turbulent stress in stratified shearing - box simulations @xcite .",
    "comparison with model gbl-@xmath47 ( which has 12.5 cells/@xmath32 in the @xmath35 direction ) suggests that convergence in global disks may be achieved at lower resolutions when the cell aspect ratio is closer to unity .",
    "with a growing number of studies using stratified shearing boxes with high resolution and/or a large spatial extent @xcite and higher resolution global models @xcite , quantifying the steady state turbulence and making direct comparisons between simulations provides a check of both consistency and convergence .",
    "one of the most popular measures of the steady state is @xmath168 . in this regard ,",
    "models gbl-@xmath47 and gbl - rand produce values of @xmath169 which is higher than recently reported by @xcite and , as noted by these authors , higher than previous global models and a number of high resolution shearing - box simulations ( see * ? ? ? * and references there - in ) .",
    "we attribute the larger @xmath168 in our models to a higher azimuthal resolution than used by @xcite , but also note the possible indication that higher @xmath168 s may be more readily achievable in global simulations .",
    "our average @xmath170 ( for models gbl-@xmath47 and gbl - rand ) is in good agreement with the @xmath171 achieved by the highest resolution shearing - box simulations to - date @xcite . considering that our models have a lower number of cells/@xmath32 than the aforementioned shearing - box models",
    ", there may also be an indication that convergence may be achieved at lower grid resolutions than in localized models , potentially due to averaging over a larger volume , and capturing lower wavenumber eddies .    comparing models gbl-@xmath42 and gbl-@xmath47 , strong evidence points to the grid cell aspect ratio and , in particular , the resolution in the @xmath35 direction as an important parameter in achieving a high @xmath168 and @xmath172 ( see the discussion in @xcite  @xcite , @xcite  @xcite , @xcite  @xcite and @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the dynamo cycle - which helps to sustain the turbulent state and involves the mri as a driving agent - can operate more effectively at higher frequencies when the cell aspect ratio is closer to unity .",
    "related to @xmath172 is the tilt angle , @xmath173 , where @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "it has been argued by @xcite that this parameter provides a better measure of convergence than @xmath168 , at least in the case of unstratified turbulence for which the question of convergence in the absence of explicit dissipation was raised by @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath175 for model gbl-@xmath42 which is consistent with previous findings for stratified global disks @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also for recent stratified global disks calculations performed with an orbital advection algorithm by @xcite .",
    "these results are encouraging as they show that global simulations are reaching sufficient grid resolution to reproduce shearing - box results .",
    "the ratio of directional magnetic energy also provides insight into convergence and correspondence between simulations .",
    "we find , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 for models gbl-@xmath47 and gbl - rand .",
    "these values are higher than obtained by @xcite for their global disk simulations , and in some cases only slightly lower than values found from high resolution shearing - box simulations @xcite .",
    "interestingly , model gbl-@xmath42 produces a sustained stress , albeit with a lower value than model gbl-@xmath47 , but with only 4 cells/@xmath32 in the @xmath35-direction .",
    "@xcite found that at least 8 cells/@xmath32 were required to produce a sustained turbulent stress ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , these authors used linear reconstruction , whereas we have used parabolic reconstruction which may permit a sustained stress at a slightly lower resolution .",
    "finally , we note that we do not see any prominent evidence of recurring transient phenomena due to linear growth revivals in the mean magnetic fields , as recently reported by @xcite",
    ". this may be due to differences in the numerical setup between our models and those of @xcite , or perhaps this phenomena occurs at later times that we have not reached with the simulation runtimes of our models .",
    "we have performed global 3d mhd simulations of turbulent accretion disks which start from fully equilibrium mhd initial conditions .",
    "the local linear theory of the mri is used as a predictor of the growth of magnetic field perturbations in the global simulations .",
    "additional tests have also been performed to compare results obtained from global simulations using a number of different numerical algorithms and resolutions to the linear growth estimates .",
    "our main findings are :    a.   the growth of magnetic field perturbations in the global simulations shows good agreement with the linear mri growth estimates during approximately the first orbit of the disk .",
    "subsequently , the overwhelming influence of non - linear motions , which may be due either to the onset of turbulence or to secondary instabilities , saturates the _ local _ growth .",
    "b.   the saturated state is found to be independent of the initially excited mri mode , showing that once the disk has expelled the initial net flux field and settled into quasi - periodic oscillations in the toroidal magnetic flux , the dynamo cycle regulates the global saturation stress level .",
    "furthermore , time - averaged measures of quasi - steady turbulence are found to be in agreement with previous work . in particular ,",
    "the time averaged stress , @xmath181 .",
    "c.   we find @xmath178 for global stratified simulations with 12.5 cells/@xmath32 in the @xmath35 direction , which is in good agreement with value found from high resolution , stratified , shearing - box simulations .",
    "higher @xmath35 resolution in the simulation ( at least @xmath182 cells/@xmath32 ) is required to maintain stronger radial and vertical magnetic field , and consequently a larger @xmath168 .",
    "d.   from the numerical algorithms that we tested , the choice of reconstruction order or limiter does not significantly alter the resulting linear mri growth rate .",
    "convergence with resolution ( for the linear mri growth tests ) is found for resolutions of roughly @xmath1cells per scaleheight ( in the vertical direction ) .",
