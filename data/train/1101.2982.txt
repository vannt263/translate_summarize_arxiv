    ", the corresponding reasoning leads to questions of asymptotics of _ multiple orthogonal _",
    "polynomials , as we will discuss in section  [ section : sixvertex ] .    here",
    "we will focus on a particular regime of the six - vertex model , known as the `` free fermion line '' . in the homogeneous case ,",
    "this case is trivial , the partition function being identically @xmath1 .",
    "also in the inhomogeneous case , a closed expression for the partition function can be calculated explicitly , so the present results do not give any new insights into the original model , but should rather be considered as providing exact and asymptotic information in its own right on the associated polynomials , the _ multiple meixner - pollaczek polynomials_.    an important tool in the study of ( usual ) orthogonal polynomials @xmath2 on the real line , appropriately scaled in order to have @xmath0-dependent weights , is that their limiting zero distribution satisfies an equilibrium problem .",
    "this equilibrium problem is an important ingredient for the steepest descent analysis of the riemann - hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials , thereby allowing to obtain strong and uniform asymptotics of the polynomials , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "for the case of multiple orthogonal polynomials , however , no general result is known about the existence of an equilibrium problem .",
    "the aim of this paper is to obtain such an equilibrium problem for multiple meixner - pollaczek polynomials .",
    "the equilibrium problem will be posed in terms of a couple of measures @xmath3 and it involves both an external source acting on @xmath4 and a constraint acting on @xmath5 .",
    "this structure is very similar to the equilibrium problem for the gue with external source model , @xcite .",
    "our method for obtaining the equilibrium problem is similar to that applied to other systems of multiple orthogonal polynomials @xcite , but a distinguishing feature is the characterization in terms of the eigenvalue distributions of block toeplitz matrices , rather than usual ( scalar ) toeplitz matrices",

    "[ propconstraint ] the upper constraint measure @xmath164 in is a multiple of the lebesgue measure on the imaginary axis with density @xmath590 .",
    "because of symmetry it is enough to consider the density on the positive imaginary axis .",
    "let @xmath591 .",
    "then @xmath592 and by a calculation as in the proof of proposition [ extfieldv ] this is equal to @xmath593    now we are going to make the change of variables @xmath594 . since @xmath595 , @xmath596 , and @xmath597",
    ", we obtain @xmath598 with integration along a contour from @xmath599 to @xmath600 that intersects the real line in @xmath601 see and figure [ plot_symbol ] for @xmath487 .",
    "it is easy to check ( and this can also be seen from figure [ plot_symbol ] ) that @xmath602 and so the contour intersects the real line in a point lying in between the simple root and the double root of @xmath603 . the branch of @xmath604 that is used in is the one that is defined and analytic in @xmath605 \\cup [ 0 , \\infty)$ ] and that is in @xmath606 for @xmath607 .",

    "the deformed contour goes along the positive real axis , starting at @xmath613 on the lower side , and ending at @xmath613 on the upper side of the real axis .",
    "it gives the contribution @xmath614 with our choice of square root we have @xmath615 where @xmath616 is the positive square root of a real and positive number .",
    "so the contribution from the positive real line is the integral @xmath617 and this integral we already calculated in and .",
