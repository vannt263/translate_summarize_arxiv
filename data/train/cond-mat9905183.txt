    "the complexity and variety of soft condensed matter is largely due to the fact that length scales of different orders of magnitude are present @xcite .",
    "when dealing with polymers in computer simulations , one therefore often intends to analyze the scaling behavior , where the nature of the underlying chemistry becomes unimportant @xcite . when constructing models for these systems it is crucial to coarse  grain the details and to keep the relevant length scales in order to observe the phenomena one is interested in .",
    "since bead  spring models in md simulations are an appropriate means to yield the right universal laws , they have been widely used to simulate the scaling behavior of polymers and much progress has been made using these models @xcite .    while in some systems , e.  g. in highly concentrated solutions or in melts , the dynamic properties are not affected by the solvent  such that these can be simulated by conventional bead  spring models without explicitly taking into account the solvent  there are many phenomena in polymer science where the influence of the solvent on the polymer dynamics can not be neglected .",
    "for example , in dilute or semi  dilute polymer solutions , the dynamical behavior is changed and even dominated by hydrodynamic interaction between different parts of the polymers .",
    "this eventually leads to a long  range interaction which is mediated by the solvent @xcite . with this paper , we want to provide a new efficient method for the simulation of polymer systems where hydrodynamics plays a role .",
    "the idea is to focus on the really necessary parts only , i.  e. the hydrodynamics of the solvent and the ( brownian ) motion of the polymer chains , thereby trying to keep the computational costs at a minimum .",
    "our test case is the dynamics of a single chain in a solvent .",
    "this problem has continuously attracted the attention of md researchers @xcite , mainly because existing analytical theories @xcite rely on uncontrollable assumptions that can be tested using computer simulations .",
    "simulating such systems by md is only possible if one introduces explicit solvent particles .",
    "hence one has to face the problem that almost all cpu time goes into the propagation of the solvent particles , while one is mainly interested in the chain properties . however , there are also other computational methods than md available for soft condensed matter systems where hydrodynamics is important , not only in the field of polymers but for example also in colloidal suspensions .",
    "these include brownian dynamics simulations @xcite , and dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) @xcite .",
    "both of them have inherent strengths , but also some disadvantages : the first technique must face the problem that the algorithm scales as the cube of the number of particles , and the latter ( like md ) simulates the solvent particles explicitly , leading to simulations of several thousand particles even for a single chain of , say , 30 monomers . compared to md , dpd has the advantage of much larger time steps , mainly because of the use of very soft potentials @xcite .",
    "a lot of progress in the theoretical framework of the method has been achieved @xcite , but some practical problems remain , like the time step dependent temperature and the small schmidt number @xcite .",
    "recently , however , some effort has been made to fill this gap @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use a recently proposed method @xcite that couples a lattice boltzmann approach for the fluid to bead  spring polymer chains . the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) @xcite",
    "was developed to simulate hydrodynamics on a grid .",
    "the lbm was shown to be an effective and fast method for simulating fluid flows , comparable to finite  difference @xcite or spectral methods @xcite .",
    "ladd applied the lbm successfully to colloidal systems @xcite : the colloidal particles are simulated as hard spheres by using stick boundary conditions .",
    "this leads to a very efficient algorithm : its cpu cost scales linearly with the number of particles , and it uses a `` minimal '' model to simulate the fluid .",
    "besides , ladd also showed @xcite that fluctuations can be incorporated into the lbm in the spirit of landau  lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite , which is essential if one wants to investigate brownian motion",
    ".    now one might think of a direct application of ladd s method to polymer  solvent systems . however , using hard spheres to model the monomers is not necessary here , as rotational degrees of freedom as well as stick boundary conditions are not relevant : on the large length and time scales we are interested in , like the radius of gyration and the zimm time of the polymer , it is sufficient that hydrodynamic interaction has evolved .",
    "the `` microscopic details '' of the coupling should then not play a role . in this spirit , we couple the lbm to bead  spring polymer chains by a simple friction ansatz , thereby treating the monomers as point particles for the fluid .",
    "we will show that this ansatz is sufficient to simulate both the static and dynamic scaling behavior of the polymer .",
    "the simulation of the fluid by lbm rather than explicit particles and the simple friction ansatz lead to a large speedup in computer time of about a factor of 20 when compared to pure md , or even more if one is willing to be satisfied with less accurate data .",
    "additionally , we map our method to a pure md simulation , i.  e. we show how to determine all physical input values from the results of md , allowing us to compare our results to an existing md simulation with explicit solvent particles @xcite . in other words",
    ", the fluid in the new method can be viewed as a coarse  grained md fluid , and there exists a well  defined procedure for how to do the coarse  graining .",
    "of course , in using such a mesoscopic approach it is no longer possible to include detailed chemistry like in atomistic md simulations .",
    "this is , however , a quite common feature of mesoscopic simulation methods ; dpd simulations do not include atomistic details either .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : we outline the method in section [ method ] , and present the numerical results in section [ sec : singlechain ] , which are compared to pure md in section [ sec : mapping ] . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude with some final remarks and an outlook to further studies .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method is a discrete formulation of the boltzmann equation on a lattice , leading to the navier ",
    "stokes equations in the incompressible limit by means of a chapman ",
    "enskog expansion @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to a variety of fluid flow problems , and it is especially well  suited for complex fluids because of the possibility of straightforward implementation of complex boundaries .",
    "the central quantity of the algorithm is @xmath3 , the number of particles in a volume @xmath4 at the grid point @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , which have the velocity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing , @xmath9 the time step and @xmath10 a vector leading to the @xmath11th neighbor on a grid with unit lattice constant .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath3 is the lattice boltzmann equation @xmath12 the last term expresses the relaxation of @xmath13 towards a local pseudo  equilibrium , which resembles a bhatnagar  gross  krook ( bgk ) collision operator @xcite in the continuum boltzmann equation .",
    "the constant matrix @xmath14 can be interpreted as the scattering between particle population @xmath11 and @xmath15 .",
    "its eigenvalues can be determined from physical and numerical arguments , such that its explicit form is not necessary for the simulation algorithm @xcite .",
    "the local pseudo  equilibrium distribution @xmath16 depends on the density @xmath17 and fluid current @xmath18 only . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the mass of a fluid particle . the usual functional form for @xmath16 is assumed @xcite : @xmath20",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( which depend on the sublattice @xmath25 , i.  e. the magnitude of @xmath10 ) are determined to reproduce the correct macroscopic hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "note that this is contrary to continuum kinetic theory , where the maxwell  boltzmann distribution is determined by entropy considerations and the navier ",
    "stokes equations follow naturally by the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion @xcite .",
    "hence it is called _ pseudo_equilibrium .",
    "explicit values for the coefficients @xmath21,@xmath22,@xmath23 and @xmath24 are known for different lattices @xcite .    here",

    "stokes equations are sufficient . for this reason ,",
    "we neglect the nonlinear term in the equilibrium distribution ( [ eq : eq.distr . ] ) , i.  e. we effectively set @xmath30 , thus obtaining a simpler and faster algorithm @xcite .",
    "fluctuations can be incorporated into the lattice boltzmann method @xcite .",
    "the central idea is to add fluctuations to the fluxes of the conserved variables , i.  e. the stress tensor , and not to the hydrodynamic fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in this way , local mass and momentum conservation",
    "can be guaranteed @xcite .",
    "the fluctuating lattice boltzmann equation reads @xmath33 with the stochastic term @xmath34 the random stress fluctuations @xmath35 are assumed to have white noise behavior @xmath36 by solving the resulting discrete langevin equation for the current one finds the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation relation @xcite for this system ; the noise strength @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dynamic viscosity .",
    "the lbm was tested extensively , compared to other navier  stokes solvers and found to have comparable speed and accuracy ( see for example refs . ) .",
    "the polymer model consists of repulsive lennard ",
    "jones monomers connected via non  harmonic springs ( fene potential ) @xcite : @xmath40 in order to model the excluded volume effect the lennard ",
    "jones potential acts between all monomers . as usual",
    ", the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 and the mass @xmath43 of the monomer define our unit system .",
    "therefore we wrote the lbm in dimensional form in the last section , rather than using the usual dimensionless lattice units .",
    "the equations of motion resulting from these potentials are integrated using the velocity verlet algorithm @xcite with a time step @xmath44 .",
    "note that there is a priori no need to set @xmath45 and we will exploit this fact below .    the polymer model has been applied successfully to the simulation of many systems @xcite including a single chain in explicit solvent @xcite , so that we can compare chain properties in using these potentials .      as mentioned above , for the length and time scales of the polymer chain , the `` microscopic '' details of the coupling should not play a role , as long as one assures that hydrodynamics evolves in the fluid on time scales faster than the diffusion time scale of the monomers .",
    "it is not necessary to resolve the shape of the monomer for the fluid .",
    "thus , we can treat one monomer as a point particle .",
    "in analogy to the stokes formula for a sphere in a viscous fluid , we assume the force on the monomer exerted by the fluid to be proportional to the difference of the velocity of the monomer @xmath46 and the fluid velocity @xmath47 at the monomer s position , @xmath48.\\ ] ] here , @xmath49 is a proportionality coefficient which we will refer to as the `` bare '' friction coefficient .",
    "this ansatz has also been used in the simulation of sedimentation @xcite .    because the fluid velocity is only calculated at the discrete lattice sites in the simulation",
    ", one has to interpolate to get @xmath50 at the monomer s position .",
    "we implement a simple linear interpolation using the grid points on the elementary lattice cell containing the monomer : denoting the relative position of the monomer in this cell by @xmath51 , with the origin being at the lower left front edge ( see fig . [",
    "fig : coupling ] ) , we can define @xmath52 etc .",
    "the formula for the linear interpolation then reads @xmath53 where ng denotes the grid points on the considered elementary lattice cell .    in order to conserve the total momentum of fluid and monomer we have to assign the opposite force to the fluid in that cell .",
    "note that then the interaction is purely local .",
    "in particular , the force density @xmath54 which is to be given to the fluid leads to a momentum density transfer per md time step @xmath44 of @xmath55 the last equation has to be satisfied for the change in the number of particles @xmath56 of the grid points on the elementary lattice cell in order to exchange the momentum density @xmath57 . besides , one must also ensure mass conservation in the fluid , @xmath58 the way how to calculate the corresponding @xmath56 at the nearest grid points is not unique ; one possibility was presented in ref . .",
    "here , we follow a different approach which seems slightly more natural : for given hydrodynamic fields @xmath59 and @xmath60 at a certain grid point @xmath5 , the equilibrium distribution can be calculated according to eq .",
    "[ eq : eq.distr . ] . the change in the equilibrium distribution at the points @xmath61 due to the presence of the monomer",
    "can therefore be determined : @xmath31 stays constant ( mass conservation ) , while @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the fraction  ( [ eq : deltar ] ) of the total @xmath57 which is given to the specific grid point @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , by requiring that @xmath64 remains unchanged , we obtain @xmath65 where again the nonlinear part of eq .",
    "[ eq : eq.distr .",
    "] has been neglected , consistent with our overall procedure .",
    "more accurate algorithms ( which would however be computationally more expensive ) could be constructed , using the method proposed in ref .",
    "; however , this is not necessary for our purposes : our simple approach is consistent with locality of the interaction , plus momentum conservation , and should therefore suffice to build up hydrodynamic interactions in the correct manner .    as we discussed in ref .",
    ", one has to take care when adding stochastic terms to the system . due to the dissipative nature of the coupling ,",
    "it is necessary to incorporate fluctuations to both the fluid and the monomers , i.  e. to the lbm like in eq .",
    "[ eq : stoch.lbm ] , and to the monomers by extending eq .",
    "[ eq : ansatz ] to @xmath66+{{\\mathbf{f}}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath67 is a stochastic force of zero mean and @xmath68 the momentum transfer to the fluid for the fluctuating case is calculated in the same way as described above without the fluctuations .",
    "for this reason , the total momentum of fluid and polymer is conserved locally also in the fluctuating case .",
    "one can show analytically that with this method the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation relation holds for the continuum limit of the model , where the coupling to the lbm fluid is replaced by the analogous coupling to a navier  stokes fluid with thermal fluctuations of the flow field . for the velocities of the monomers and the fluid flow velocity , the equilibrium distribution",
    "is then given by the maxwell  boltzmann distribution , while the conformational statistics of the chain is given by the boltzmann distribution , i.  e. governed by the intra  chain potentials @xmath69 and @xmath70 , see eq .",
    "this should be contrasted with the md case , where the potential due to the solvent particles has an additional influence . for the discrete case",
    ", one can check the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation relation by investigating the velocity relaxation of one ( initially kicked ) monomer in the fluid on the one hand , and the velocity autocorrelation , if fluctuations are added , on the other hand .",
    "the two quantities coincide for our model @xcite , which is expected from linear response theory .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in the overdamped limit for the monomer motion , and the continuum limit for the fluid , our approach is identical to the oono  freed equations of motion @xcite , which are commonly used in polymer solution theory .",
    "the main justification of our approach relies on the fact that a hydrodynamic ( navier  stokes ) description of the fluid works down to very short ( actually , surprisingly short ) length and time scales .",
    "therefore , one should expect that the flow around a monomer should be describable by the solution of the navier  stokes equation as soon as the distance is larger than a few lattice spacings .",
    "the same argument holds for the analogous md system , where one expects navier  stokes behavior beyond a few particle diameters .",
    "therefore , we may say that any two local couplings ( for example , our lbm friction ansatz vs. md ) are equivalent as soon as they produce the same long  range flow field .",
    "if this is the case , then the hydrodynamic interaction between two monomers ( as long as they are not too close ) will be identical , and the single ",
    "monomer mobilities will also match ( note that for a particle which is pulled through the fluid at constant velocity by a constant force , the friction coefficient is determined by the energy dissipated in the surrounding flow field ) .",
    "this latter property actually allows for an easy determination of the simulation parameter @xmath49 , which we will now , for the sake of clarity , denote by the symbol @xmath71 . a heuristic procedure , which was followed in ref . , is to vary this parameter in a set of simulations of a single monomer in solvent ( which can be done very easily ) , and to measure the momomer diffusion coefficient @xmath72 , until the latter has the desired value .",
    "if viscosity and fluid density match as well , then the long  range parts of the flow fields ( beyond a few lattice spacings ) must look the same . it should be noted that the einstein relation @xmath73 thus defines an effective or renormalized friction coefficient , which differs from the original bare one , as it contains all the backflow effects .",
    "since these tend to increase the mobility , one has @xmath74 .",
    "more quantitatively , one can argue as follows : let us consider a particle which is pulled through the solvent at constant velocity @xmath46 by an external force @xmath75 . then , rewriting eq .",
    "[ eq : ansatz ] , we find @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the flow velocity averaged over the nearest lattice sites of the particle , as implemented by our interpolation procedure .",
    "however , to a good approximation , the flow field should be given by the oseen tensor : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the distance from the particle .",
    "hence the averaged flow field should  in our case of averaging roughly at a distance @xmath8 from the particle  have the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an unknown numeric constant describing the details of the lattice geometry and of the averaging procedure . for example , doing the average over a sphere of radius @xmath82 , one would directly obtain @xmath83 , from which one easily derives stokes law . combining these results and using @xmath84 one obtains @xmath85 i.  e.",
    "the overall mobility is simply the sum of the bare mobility and a hydrodynamic , stokes ",
    "type contribution , where the lattice discretization serves to provide an effective stokes radius of the monomers .",
    "this relation has been tested by running several simulations at different bare couplings and different lattice constants ; the agreement is remarkable , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : zetaeffzetabare ] , where we plot @xmath86 as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "the parameter @xmath81 is thus found to have the value @xmath88 for our method .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath8 hence appears not only as a parameter which controls how accurately the navier  stokes equation is solved ( this is the usual case for navier  stokes equation solvers ) , but it is being assigned an additional meaning as an effective stokes radius .",
    "for that reason , it can not be varied arbitrarily , but only within limits : a too small lattice constant would result in an unphysically large particle mobility , even if @xmath71 is very large .",
    "this is quite different from conventional navier  stokes equation solving , where one obtains systematically better results when @xmath8 is decreased , and can be viewed as the price which has to be paid for introducing the simple and computationally fast concept of a point particle , which is however , strictly spoken , unphysical .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath71 controls the degree of coupling to the flow field : for small @xmath71 , one has @xmath89 , while for large @xmath71 the stokes contribution prevails , @xmath90 .",
    "it should have become clear that hence @xmath71 has no real physical meaning whatsoever ; it is really the effective friction which matters for the coupling .",
    "the present model is intended to represent the same physical situation as an existing pure md simulation @xcite .",
    "we therefore choose the physical input values for the new method as obtained by the former ( all values are given in the unit system specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : bead.spring ] ) .",
    "the fluid is characterized by the the temperature @xmath91 , the density @xmath92 , and the kinematic viscosity @xmath93 . the parameter @xmath19 ( the fluid particle mass ) is unimportant ; its value can be absorbed in a re  definition of the @xmath13 .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath8 of the grid is set to unity ; this is roughly the same as the bond length of the polymer chain , and the interparticle distance of the md fluid . as in the pure md simulation",
    ", we study chains of length @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the corresponding grid sizes ( which are important parameters , since they determine the hydrodynamic interaction of the chain with its periodic images , see ref . ) are @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , respectively , which is roughly identical to the corresponding md box sizes .",
    "the parameters for the fene potential are taken from the md simulation as @xmath99 and @xmath100 . as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : coupling ] , this does however not assure that the static conformations are identical : in the md case , there is also the influence of the solvent , which is absent in the present method .",
    "actually , the data show a systematic deviation , which is however not very large ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results.statics ] ) .",
    "the mass of the monomers was set to unity .",
    "this actually differs from the md case where the monomer mass had been set to two .",
    "however , we also used a monomer of mass one in order to determine the `` bare '' friction coefficient @xmath101 , using the procedure outlined at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : coupling ] , such that we found @xmath102 from the requirement that the monomer diffusion coefficient has the value known from md , @xmath103 . had we used a monomer of different mass , we would also have obtained a slightly different value for @xmath71 ( these are very small effects , beyond what the simple picture which underlies eq .",
    "[ eq : relationbareeff ] can capture ) .",
    "since however on the time scale of brownian motion it is only the parameter @xmath104 which matters , we expect an influence of the mass parameter only for short times , where the dynamics differs from md behavior anyways .",
    "it remains to specify the time steps @xmath44 and @xmath9 .",
    "a choice of @xmath105 is optimal for the md part @xcite . concerning the lbm time step @xmath9 it is desirable to make it as large as possible because the fluid calculation is the cpu intensive part of the method .",
    "test simulations showed the limiting factor to be that @xmath106 is getting negative for too large time steps due to increasing fluctuations , in particular near the monomers .",
    "this situation , however , can always happen , although with decreasing probability for smaller time steps .",
    "we found that using a time step of @xmath107 only approximately each @xmath108th random number one @xmath106 became negative , while for @xmath109 such a case never occurred during the observation time .",
    "we decided to generate new random numbers in such rare cases , which of course slightly changes the distribution of the simulated noise , but is justified if the probability for negative @xmath106 s is low enough .",
    "we ran the simulations at @xmath110 and also did a simulation for the smallest system ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) using @xmath109 in order to check the results .",
    "furthermore , we should comment in some more detail on the lattice constant @xmath8 .",
    "the choice @xmath113 seems intuitively reasonable , since this matches the bond length and the interparticle distance in the md system .",
    "however , one would in principle like to make the lattice spacing as large as possible , since , for constant overall volume , the computational effort scales as @xmath114 .",
    "for this reason , we also did a test run with @xmath115 for the @xmath116 system , where we of course had re  adjusted the bare friction , see end of sec .",
    "[ sec : coupling ] .",
    "it turned out that the decay of the dynamic structure factor looks quite similar .",
    "however , there are systematic discrepancies ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : comparisonofresults ] ) , such that the gain in speed is paid for by a certain loss in accuracy .",
    "in what follows we will always refer to the case @xmath113 , unless explicitly stated otherwise .        with @xmath118 .\\ ] ] this function also exhibits a weak @xmath119dependence , see table [ table : corrfactorstable ] , even for a rw . finally , introducing @xmath120",
    "also tabulated in table [ table : corrfactorstable ] , we can write the result for @xmath121 as @xmath122 the leading power  law dependence on @xmath119 and @xmath123 is exactly what one expects from dynamic scaling .",
    "the function @xmath124 is a correction to scaling .",
    "as far as the numerical prefactor is concerned , we get ( in the rw case ) a relaxation which is roughly the same as that calculated in the textbook by doi and edwards  @xcite ."
