    "in 1935 japanese physicist hideki yukawa predicted [ 1 ] the existence of a particle - a meson - with a mass about 200 times that of the electron , which mediated the nuclear forces . at first , the muon , discovered in 1937 , looked like a good candidate for the meson , but soon it became clear that the muon s properties did not match those predicted by yukawa theory .",
    "then , in 1947 , lates , occhialini and powell discovered [ 2 ] the @xmath2 -meson , or pion , which did have the predicted meson properties .",
    "today , we know that the muon is an elementary particle [ 3 ] , cousin to the electron , -leptons and neutrinos , and that mesons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . ) , including the pion , are combinations of quark and an antiquark .",
    "everybody know that the discovery of -meson was an very important finding since this was in fact a fundamental step in the understanding the subatomic world .",
    "it heralded the beginning of a deep revision of the physical concepts on the structure of matter .",
    "however , who can tell us what exactly are those mesons ? also , it is well known that the pion as lightest of mesons has a finite size , with a mean charge radius of 0.66 fm , and that the long range part of the nucleon - nucleon forces necessarily arises from one - pion - exchange .    the traditional picture of the nucleus as a collection of neutrons and protons bound together via the strong force has proven remarkable successful in understanding a rich variety of nuclear properties .",
    "however , it is a well grounded achievement of modern nuclear physics that not only nucleons are relevant in the study of nuclear dynamics but that pions and the baryonic resonances like @xmath5 s and n * play an important role too [ 4 ] .",
    "so , when the nucleus is explored at short distance scales the presence of short lived subatomic particles , such as the pion and delta , are revealed as nuclear constituents . at",
    "even shorter distance scales the basic building blocks of matter , the quarks and gluons , are also revealed as nuclear constituents .",
    "the role of pions , deltas , quarks and gluons in the structure of nuclei is one frontier of modern nuclear physics .",
    "this modern picture of the nucleus bring us to the idea to search for new kind of natural radioactivities such as : ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 etc.)-emission during the nuclear fission in the region of heavy and superheavy nuclei .",
    "moreover , new mode of nuclear fission such as : deltonic fission an hyperfission , was also suggested and investigated .",
    "so , in 1985 , d. b. ion , m. ivascu and r. ion - mihai initiated [ 5 ] the investigation of the nuclear spontaneous pion emission as a new possible nuclear radioactivity called nuclear pionic radioactivity ( npir ) with possible essential contributions to the instability of heavy and superheavy nuclei .",
    "in this paper we present a short review not only of the main theoretical problems of the npir but also of the essential experimental results obtained in these 18 years of existence of the nuclear pionic radioactivity .",
    "moreover , in this paper by using the recent results on the spontaneous fission half lives @xmath0 of the heavy nuclei with @xmath9 we present new prediction on the pionic yields in the region of superheavy elements .",
    "the nuclear pionic radioactivity of a parent nucleus ( a , z ) can be considered as an inclusive reaction of form :    @xmath10    where x denotes any configuration of final particles ( fragments , light neutral and charged particles , etc . ) which accompany emission process .",
    "the inclusive npir is in fact a sum of all exclusive nuclear reactions allowed by the conservation laws in which a pion can be emitted by a nucleus from its ground state .",
    "the most important exclusive reactions which give the essential contribution to the inclusive npir ( 1 ) are the spontaneous pion emission accompanied by two body fission : : @xmath11 where    @xmath12    hence , the npir is an extremely complex coherent reaction in which we are dealing with a spontaneous pion emission accompanied by a rearrangement of the parent nucleus in two or many final nuclei . charged pions as well as neutral pions can be emitted during two body or many body fission of parent nucleus .",
    "the energy released in an exclusive nuclear reaction ( 1 ) is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the energy released during spontaneous fission    @xmath15    then the energy condition for the pionic radioactivity channel is    @xmath16    or @xmath17    other interesting new natural radioactivities predicted at ifin - bucharest are as follows    * * muonic radioactivity * [ 25 ] is a nuclear process in which the lepton pair @xmath18 is emitted during two or many body fission of the parent nucleus . for the the nuclear spontaneous emission of @xmath19 in binary fission we can write + @xmath20 + @xmath21 *",
    "* lambdonic radioactivity * [ 26 ] is just a nuclear reaction of form + @xmath22 + @xmath23 * * hyperonic radioactivities * @xmath24 are also the possible nuclear decays of form + @xmath25 + @xmath26 * * hyperfission or weak fission * [ 27 ] is a fission process in which in one of fragment is hypernucleus : + @xmath27 + @xmath28 * * deltonic fission * [ 28 ] is also a fission process in which in one of fragment contain a delta resonance : + @xmath29 + @xmath30    a fission - like model ( see ref.[5 ] ) for the pionic radioactivity was regarded as a first stage in the development of an approximate theory of this new phenomenon that takes into account the essential degree of freedom of the system : @xmath6-fissility , @xmath6-fission barrier height , etc .",
    "therefore , let us consider    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the usual coulomb energy and surface energy of the parent nucleus given by    @xmath35    @xmath36    with @xmath37mev and @xmath380.71 mev.@xmath39 is a parameter defined so that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the coulombian and nuclear contributions to the pion mass . for @xmath42 , the entire pion mass is obtained only from coulomb energy of the parent nucleus .",
    "so , by analogy with binary fission was introduced the pionic fissility @xmath43 which is given by    @xmath44    or    @xmath45    in the particular case @xmath46 we have    @xmath47    we note that the definitions ( 22)-(24 ) are valid only with the constraints    @xmath48    while the total variation @xmath49of parent nucleus at small deformation of type @xmath50is given by    @xmath51 = \\frac{2\\varepsilon ^{2}e_{s}^{\\pi f}\\left ( 0\\right ) } { 5}\\left [ 1-x_{\\pi f}^{\\left ( \\alpha \\right ) } \\right ]   \\label{26}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "2 we presented the regions from the plane ( a , z ) in which some parent nuclei are able to emit spontaneously pions during the nuclear fission    therefore , according to fig .",
    "2 , we have the following important regions :    * she ( super heavy elements)-region , indicated by white circles , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , all the nuclei are able to emit spontaneously pions during the sf since no pion fission barrier exists . *",
    "he ( heavy elements)-zone indicated by signs plus ( + + + ) , corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where all the nuclei can emit spontaneously pion only by quantum tunneling of the pionic fission barrier .",
    "* e - region , indicated by signs minus (  ) where the spontaneous pion emission is energetically interdicted since @xmath54 .",
    "the dynamical thresholds for the pionic fission are obtained just as in fission case by using the substitution :    @xmath55    so , by analogy with binary fission the barrier height for the pionic fission in a liquid drop model can be written as :    @xmath56    \\label{28}\\ ] ]    while the nuclear configuration at the sadle point is given by    @xmath57 \\label{29}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath58    @xmath59 is the spherical radius and @xmath60 is a scale factor just as in binary spontaneous fission .    in fig . 4 and 5 we present the values of e@xmath61 as well as the nuclear configuration at the saddle point compared with those from fission ( f ) or hyperfission ( hf ) .",
    "true barrier height for the pionic fission is @xmath62 where and @xmath63and @xmath64 are correction due to shell effect at saddle point and ground state , respectively .",
    "next , the essential ingredients used for the estimation of the relative pionic yields @xmath65 are as follows :    * the variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 defined by + @xmath68 + @xmath69 * the real function @xmath70 defined for spontaneous fission ( sf ) by + @xmath71 * the scaling property : + @xmath72 + where @xmath73 is defined in ref . [ 5 ] .    by fit",
    "were obtained the following important results :    @xmath74    for even - even parent nuclei    and    @xmath75    for parent nuclei with a - odd .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "6 we presented the experimental values of the @xmath76  compared with the fitted curve ( 37 ) .",
    "finally , by using ( 36)-(37 ) we obtain the following important prediction    @xmath77 ^{\\delta _ { \\alpha } ( a , z ) }   \\label{38}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath78    and    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    for even - even parent nuclei , and    @xmath82    for a - odd parent nuclei .    here , as in ref .",
    "[ 31 ] we also adopt the notions of _ sf - nuclide _ , _ @xmath83-nuclide _ , and _",
    "t - transition nuclide _ , as being those parent nuclei characterized by : @xmath84 , @xmath85  and yield @xmath86  , respectively , with their characteristic features presented in table 1 .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath87  calculated with ( 38)-(40 ) for @xmath42  and @xmath88  , for even - even and a - odd parent nuclei , are presented in table 2a , b .",
    "the pionic radioactivity was experimentally investigated by many authors [ 13]-[24 ] .",
    "a short review of the results obtained on the spontaneous npir yields is presented in table 3 .",
    "recently khryachkov et al .",
    "[ 24 ] presented a new high performance spectrometer for investigation of ternary nuclear fission .",
    "the measured characteristics of this spectrometer allow for its successful use in studies of ternary fission with the emission of @xmath39-particles , tritons , and protons as well as in the search for exotic nuclear fission accompanied by the emission of charged mesons ( @xmath89 . this new spectrometer was tested with a reaction of spontaneous @xmath90 ternary fission .",
    "this choice was determined by the fact that this reaction is well studied and the available data can be employed for the performance check of this facility .",
    "so , a @xmath91 layer 5 mm in diameter with an activity of 15 fissions / s was placed inside the spectrometer .",
    "the measurements were carried out continuously 1.5 months .",
    "a 2d spectrum of the scintillator signals obtained in coincidence with fragments is shown here in fig.8 ( see fig . 9 in ref . [ 24 ] ) .    analyzing spectrum in fig .",
    "8 has shown that , _ in the space between the electron and proton regions there are events that can not be explained by an external background or as effect of neutrons_. a detailed analysis of the parameter sf does not allow us to assign these events to protons or electrons .",
    "we estimate these events as an indication of the possibility of existence of a ternary nuclear decay with the participation of charged mesons .",
    "subsequently , it is suggested to study the meson emission during the spontaneous fission on this new facility which has a number of substantial advantages .",
    "the experimental and theoretical results obtained on the npir can be summarized as follows :      \\2 .",
    "the unusual background , observed by wild et al.[33 ] in ( @xmath93)-energy region below that characteristic for long range alpha emission from @xmath94 was interpreted by ion , bucurescu and ion - mihai [ 9 ] as being produced by negative pions emitted spontaneously by @xmath94 .",
    "then , they inferred value of the pionic yield is : @xmath95 for @xmath96/fission . in a similar way ,",
    "janko and povinec [ 22 ] , obtained the yield : @xmath97 for @xmath98/fission .",
    "the supergiant radiohalos ( sgh ) , discovered by grady and walker [ 34 ] and laemmlein [ 35 ] are interpreted [ 12 ] as being the @xmath96-radiohalos and @xmath98-radiohalos , respectively .",
    "hence these radiohalos are experimental signatures of the integral record in time of the natural pionic radioactivity from radioactive inclusions in ancient minerals .",
    "a new interpretation of the experimental bimodal fission is obtained in terms of the unitarity diagrams .",
    "is obtained in ref .",
    "[ 29 ] so , the presence of the symmetric mode in the fragment mass - distribution at transfermium nuclei can be interpreted as experimental signature of the pionic radioactivity .",
    "hence , it is expected that this new degree of nuclear instability can becomes dominant at she - nuclides .",
    "this idea is illustrated not only by the symmetrization of fragment mass - yields from sf of the heavy nuclei with @xmath99 experimentally observed in fig .",
    "7 but also by high values of @xmath100-yields obtained by using the theoretical prediction ( 38)-(39 ) .",
    "the nuclides @xmath101 with @xmath102 are expected to be all @xmath103-nuclides while the @xmath101-isotopes with @xmath104 are all sf - nuclides ( see table 2a ) .",
    "high pionic yields are obtained for @xmath105 ( 6.67 ) as well as for @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "\\7 . the nuclides @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) as well as @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) all",
    "are predicted to be @xmath103-nuclides .",
    "finally , we note that dedicated experiments , using nuclei with theoretically predicted high pionic yields ( e.g. @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath106 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) ) , are desired , since the discovery of the nuclear pionic radioactivity is of fundamental importance not only in nuclear science ( e. g. , for clarification of high instability of she- nuclei ) but also for geochemistry and cosmology ."
