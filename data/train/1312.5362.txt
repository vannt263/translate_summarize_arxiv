    "in 1873 , plateau @xcite published a classical work detailing experiments involving soap films spanning closed wire loops .",
    "he also considered soap films spanning multiple disjoint closed loops and found that , depending on the placement of the loops , there may or may not exist a spanning soap film .",
    "one particular example discussed by plateau involves two circular loops of equal radii . if these loops are coaxial and are sufficiently close together , then there is a spanning soap film in the shape of a catenoid . increasing the distance between the loops causes the neck of the catenoid to shrink .",
    "this continues until the ratio of the distance between the loops and their radius reaches a critical value , at which point the soap film becomes unstable and collapses to two disconnected discs corresponding to the goldschmidt @xcite solution .",
    "other instabilities involving soap films are described by weaire et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , cox & jones @xcite considered the stability of a soap film confined to a tube .",
    "their setup involves a circular cylindrical tube of ( inner ) radius @xmath0 and length @xmath1 , with a rigid wire spanning the diameter at each of its ends .",
    "cox & jones considered a soap film whose boundary consisted of the two wires and two curves on the inner wall of the tube .",
    "initially , the case in which the two wires are parallel was considered . in this case , when @xmath1 is small relative to @xmath0 , the soap film forms a flat surface .",
    "however , cox & jones found that increasing @xmath2 above a certain threshold destabilizes the soap film .",
    "they also performed this experiment after first rotating one wire relative to the other and found that the ratio @xmath2 at which the instability occurs decreases as the relative rotation of the wires increased .",
    "their results suggest that there might be a maximal angle of rotation above which a helical soap film is unstable .",
    "cox & jones obtained their results on the basis of experiments and numerical simulations using the program surface evolver .",
    "they also considered setups involving two or more crossing wires at the ends of the tube , but here we are only interested in the most simple case described above .",
    "since the days of euler , it has been known that the shape of a spanning soap film can be determined by considering a minimization problem . in this problem ,",
    "the wire loop is modeled as a simple closed curve and the soap film as a surface surface .",
    "the soap film spanning the wire is represented by the surface spanning the curve whose ( helmholtz ) free - energy is minimal  in an appropriate local sense  among all surfaces that span the curve . under the assumption of constant surface tension  which is reasonable in most situations",
    " this is equivalent to minimizing the area of the spanning surface .",
    "the problem of proving the existence of an area minimizing surface with a prescribed boundary is referred to as plateau s problem .",
    "as mentioned earlier , when several closed loops are considered , there need not exist a spanning soap film .",
    "that said , douglas @xcite , rad @xcite , and courant @xcite established sufficient conditions for the existence of a spanning film .    here , to confirm the results of cox & jones ,",
    "a linear stability analysis is conducted . for parallel wires ,",
    "the analysis confirms the critical value of @xmath2 at which the flat soap film becomes unstable obtained previously by cox & jones .",
    "the analysis also suggests that the critical value of the ratio @xmath2 at which instability occurs decreases on increasing the angle between the wires .",
    "finally , it is shown that there is a maximum rotation above which there exists no stable soap film in the shape of a helicoid .    in section 2 , a variational statement of the problem",
    "is provided and essential notation is introduced .",
    "section 3 consists of two parts . in the first part",
    ", conditions necessary and sufficient for the first variation of the underlying free - energy functional to vanish are obtained .",
    "if those conditions hold for a certain surface , that surface is referred to as a critical point of the free - energy functional . in the second part , a condition that ensures the stability of a critical point",
    "is obtained .",
    "this condition can be expressed as a functional inequality or as a condition on the eigenvalues of a certain partial - differential eigenvalue problem . in section 4 , the stability of a flat surface spanning parallel wires is analyzed .",
    "this analysis is generalized in section 5 to include the case where the wires need not be parallel . in section 6 , our results and their relation to those of cox & jones @xcite are discussed .",
    "consider a tube of length @xmath1 with an annular cross - section consisting of two concentric circles , the innermost of which has radius @xmath0 . with a rescaling",
    ", it suffices to consider a tube with innermost radius @xmath3 and dimensionless length [ dimpar ] : = .",
    "suppose that at each end of the tube there is a wire the centerline of which is a diameter for the innermost cross - section .",
    "assume that both the tube and the wires are rigid .",
    "the innermost cross - section of the tube is modeled as a cylindrical tube @xmath4 of length @xmath5 and radius @xmath3 and the wires are modeled as line segments @xmath6 and @xmath7 of length @xmath8 ( figure 1 ) . denote the union of the wires by @xmath9 .",
