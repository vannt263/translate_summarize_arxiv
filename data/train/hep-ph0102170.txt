    "@xmath1 decays .",
    "these decays represent a favorable laboratory to study the dynamics of heavy quark decays , to determine the size of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ckm mixing matrix elements , crucial in the unitarity triangle test of the standard model , and to acquire informations on the structure of the @xmath1 meson itself .",
    "the aleph , delphi , l3 and opal experiments have analyzed together about 1.5  m s.l .",
    "@xmath1 decays recorded at lep , at energies around the @xmath4 pole from 1990 to 1995 .",
    "this statistics is significantly lower than about 4  m s.l .",
    "decays recorded by cleo and 7.5  m already logged by the babar and belle experiments .",
    "however , the significant boost of the beauty hadrons , the confinement of their decay products in well separated jets and the production of almost all beauty hadron species make it possible to perform topological decay reconstruction with good efficiency on the lep data sets , thus exploiting analysis techniques complementary to those used at lower energy @xmath5 colliders .",
    "since operator product expansion ( ope ) predictions apply to sufficiently inclusive observables , it is advantageous to reconstruct s.l",
    ".  decays inclusively , with only mild cuts on the lepton and hadron energies .",
    "further , the lep kinematics allow the two extreme kinematical regions at small and large momentum transfer to be accessed , since the @xmath1 decay products gain enough energy from the @xmath1 boost .",
    "the determination of the inclusive s.l .  branching fraction br(@xmath6 ) is important for the measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "together with the measurement of the charm multiplicity and of exclusive decays discussed later in this section , they provide with a test of the s.l .  decay width .",
    "the main experimental issue here is the separation of the prompt @xmath7 signal from the cascade @xmath8 and the @xmath9 backgrounds .",
    "the lep analyses use the charge correlation between the @xmath10 and the lepton , the decay topology , and double tagged events where both beauty hadrons decay semileptonically .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty is due to the modeling of the @xmath7 and @xmath9 spectra .",
    "the lep average , obtained from the direct determinations , gives br(@xmath6 ) = 0.1056 @xmath11 0.0011  ( stat ) @xmath11 0.0018  ( syst ) .",
    "after having rescaled this value by @xmath12 , to account for the different beauty hadron species produced , this result can be compared with the most recent determination at the @xmath0 , obtained by cleo using a lepton tagged method to separate the prompt lepton yield in @xmath1 decays from the backgrounds giving br(@xmath6 ) = 0.1049 @xmath11 0.0017  ( stat ) @xmath11 0.0043  ( syst)@xcite .",
    "it is useful to analyze these results in relation with the average number of charm particles in @xmath1 decays , @xmath13 , since the semileptonic , double charmed and charmless yields are correlated once the total decay width is fixed .",

    "restores agreement with the data for @xmath19 , however the overall yield of the broad @xmath20 states is not expected to exceed that for @xmath15 . this apparent discrepancy with the preliminary delphi result",
    "can now be explained as an experimental effect , if the feed - through of non - resonant @xmath21 production@xcite is non negligible .",
    "a first estimate of the slope of the @xmath22 form factor has also been obtained at lep .",
    "delphi performed a fit to the reconstructed @xmath23 distribution and event rate for a sample of candidate @xmath24 decays obtaining @xmath25 = 1.55 @xmath11 0.60  ( stat ) @xmath11 0.55  ( syst)@xcite , which is within the range of the current theoretical predictions .",
    "the value of the @xmath2 element can be extracted from the inclusive charmless s.l .  branching fraction br(@xmath26 ) by using the following relationship derived in the context of heavy quark expansion@xcite : @xmath27 where the value @xmath28 = ( 4.58 @xmath11 0.06 )  gev / c@xmath29 has been assumed@xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are small , due to the absence of @xmath30 term in the expansion and of @xmath31 dependence , and it is dominated by that on the @xmath10 mass . inserting the lep average br(@xmath26 ) , @xmath2 was determined to be : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 and hqe model systematics is slightly below 10% and the large uncertainties from the modeling of @xmath36 decays can be reduced in future by more precise data .",
    "this inclusive determination of @xmath2 can be compared to that extracted from the determination of the exclusive rate for the decay @xmath37 by cleo giving @xmath2 = ( 3.25 @xmath11 0.14 ( stat . ) @xmath38 ( syst . )",

    ", the result is @xmath3 = ( 40.7 @xmath11 0.5  ( exp ) @xmath11 2.0  ( th ) ) @xmath39 .",
    "this inclusive method is limited by the lepton spectrum model systematics from the s.l .  branching ratio and by the theory systematics due to the values of @xmath28 and @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) and to the use of only the first terms of the operator product expansion as highlighted in eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    in the exclusive method ,",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is determined from the differential decay rate extrapolated to zero recoil .",
    "the extraction of @xmath3 relies on heavy quark symmetry for the form factor normalization @xmath47 in the heavy quark limit and requires the computation of the finite @xmath10-quark mass effect and of non - perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "the value @xmath48 has been adopted by the lep working group@xcite giving @xmath3 = ( 39.8 @xmath11 1.8  ( exp ) @xmath11 2.2  ( th ) ) @xmath39 .",
    "this result is in agreement with that obtained with the inclusive method .",
    "there has been a recent lattice determination of @xmath49 ; unquenched computations will provide smaller and better understood systematics .",
    "however the larger value obtained by the recent cleo analysis suggests a cautious attitude and the need for more experimental data .",
    "as more data on s.l .",
    "@xmath10 decays have become available and the analysis techniques improved , the determinations of basic parameters of @xmath10  decays , such as the @xmath2 and @xmath3 elements , are limited by theoretical uncertainties and by the modelling of the signal and backgrounds@xcite . while this is promoting new phenomenological approaches , it also requires new measurements to better determine the input parameters and further constrain the models .",
    "this interplay between progresses in theory and new experimental insights addresses three main classes of questions : i ) the definition of a coherent method to include bound state effects in the description of inclusive decays , ii ) the accurate determination of the fundamental parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( or @xmath45 ) , and iii ) the estimate of the effects of the missing terms in the ope and of violations of quark - hadron duality .    at present ,",
    "inclusive spectra are predicted by a variety of specialized models ranging from fully inclusive models , such as the accmm model@xcite , to those saturating the inclusive decay width by the contribution of several exclusive final states , like the isgw and isgw-2 models@xcite . while these models can describe the data quite precisely , after tuning of their parameters , their application _ tout court _ to different processes is often not justifiable . in inclusive models ,",
    "the spectra are obtained for a free quark decaying into partons and the non - perturbative corrections are included by convoluting the parton spectra with a function encoding the kinematics of the @xmath10 and spectator @xmath52 quarks inside the heavy hadron@xcite . the model free parameters are derived from the shapes of inclusive observables .",
    "figure  [ fig : pffit ] summarizes the results from fits to the energy spectrum of the lepton in s.l .",
    "@xmath6 decays from lep and cleo data , showing a good consistency .",
    "the main issue here is to establish the validity of the accmm model , with these fitted values , to other decays , such as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this difficulty may be overcome by a description of the fermi motion in the framework of qcd .",
    "this introduces an universal shape function , @xmath55@xcite . at leading order and in the large @xmath28 limit",
    ", the light - cone residual momentum @xmath56 can be expressed as the difference between the @xmath10 quark mass and its effective mass @xmath57 inside the hadron : @xmath58 .",
    "however , the functional form of the function @xmath55 is not _ a priori _ known , except for its first three moments .",
    "the effect of different _ ansatz _ for the description of the fermi motion of the @xmath10  quark inside the heavy hadron has been studied in the case of @xmath26 both at the parton level@xcite and for the physical observables after full detector simulation@xcite .",
    "it was found that the fermi motion description contributes with an uncertainty on the branching fraction determination of @xmath11  5 - 15% , increasing as the hadronic mass @xmath59 cut to distinguish @xmath35 from @xmath36 transitions is lowered and depending also on the other selection criteria .    since @xmath28 enters at the fifth power in the expression of the decay width , @xmath60 , it is important to determine its value with an accuracy of better than @xmath11 100  mev/@xmath61 to guarantee a few percent error contribution in the extraction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 from inclusive decays .",
    "the dependence of the shape of inclusive spectra on the @xmath10  quark mass represents a further source of systematics from @xmath28 .",
    "recent estimates from @xmath62 spectroscopy , qcd sum rules and nnlo unquenched lattice computations have shown a remarkable agreement@xcite .",
    "on the basis of these results@xcite , the lep working groups have adopted @xmath63 = ( 4.58 @xmath11 0.06 )  gev/@xmath61 , where @xmath64 is defined such as @xmath65 and the quoted uncertainty defines a 68% confidence region .",
    "the first moments of the lepton energy and hadronic mass spectra can be used to determine the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67@xcite .",
    "an analysis of the cleo lepton energy spectrum limited to the region @xmath68 1.5  gev gave @xmath69 = ( 0.39 @xmath11 0.11 )  gev and @xmath45 = ( 0.19 @xmath11 0.10 )  gev@xmath70@xcite .",
    "cleo reported the preliminary results from the first combined study of the first two moments of the hadronic mass and the lepton energy spectra@xcite .",
    "the hadronic mass moments were found to be in good agreement with the previous result , while the lepton energy spectrum gave unlikely and incompatible values . however , the model dependence in the extrapolation to the full spectrum and the unknown contributions of higher order terms @xmath71 prevent the derivation of any conclusions from these disagreements and highlight the importance of further data .",
    "the predictions for the inclusive analyses presented before and the extraction of the ckm matrix elements both rely on the basic assumption of duality , i.e. that the rates computed at the parton level correspond to those for the physical final states , after integrating enough hadronic channels .",
    "the validity of this assumption has been studied in a qcd model at the large @xmath72 and small velocity limit@xcite and in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimension t  hooft model@xcite .",
    "it was found that the sum over exclusive channels corresponds to the inclusive ope prediction to a very good accuracy soon after having integrated the first resonant states .",
    "it is interesting to comment here on the consistency of the determinations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with inclusive and exclusive methods discussed above .",
    "the agreement between the measured values is a test of the accuracy of the theoretical methods and also of the validity of the quark - hadron duality assumption , up to the combined measurement uncertainties , i.e. @xmath73 8% for @xmath36 and 25% for @xmath35 . with improved analyses and computational techniques and using the larger data sets , already becoming available at cleo iii ,",
    "babar and belle , these tests may reach a sensitivity of @xmath74 within a few years .",
