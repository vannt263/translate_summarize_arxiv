    "our method can also be used to calculate the electrical contribution to the fluctuations of a membrane containing pumps .",
    "this contribution , was not taken into account in ref .",
    "we first consider the case of a membrane of zero thickness , and then generalize the model to the case of a bilayer with a finite thickness and a finite dielectric constant , lower than that of the solvent .",
    "the later model is more realistic since it contains both capacitive effects and ions transport @xcite .",
    "in this section , we compute the electrostatic potential @xmath0 , and then use the electrostatic forces as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations to obtain the membrane equation of motion .",

    "more precisely , the first - order steady - state solution of our electrokinetic equations is then @xmath54 ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "having determined perturbatively the ion concentrations and the electric field , we study the membrane undulations imposed by the hydrodynamics of the surrounding electrolyte",
    ". the velocity field is obtained from the stokes equation in the presence of a force density @xmath57 acting on the fluid  @xcite , @xmath58 with the incompressibility condition @xmath59 .",
    "away from the membrane , the boundary condition is @xmath60 .",

    "one can then derive the fluid velocity @xmath64 at the membrane surface by solving perturbatively eq .  .",

    "thus , if nonthermal noise can be neglected , the fluctuation spectrum is @xmath72 , where we have assumed that the membrane has , in addition to the electrostatic contribution , a bare tension @xmath73 and a bare bending modulus @xmath74 .",
    "let us now discuss the physical significance of this result :    \\(i ) the first important point is that this derivation of the fluctuation spectrum is independent of the origin of the ion fluxes .",
    "in particular , it applies also to the case where the ion fluxes are produced _ internally _ by active pumps , in the absence of any external potential difference @xmath75 and concentration gradients @xmath76 .",
    "alternatively , it also applies when the fluxes are produced by concentration gradients @xmath77 in the absence of any external potential difference @xmath75 , provided that the two ions are different ( we must require @xmath78 or @xmath79 so that @xmath80 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in addition to the renormalizations of the membrane tension and bending modulus , a term proportional to @xmath81 in the effective free energy is present . this term does not exist for an equilibrium membrane in an electrolyte solution , as the electrostatic potential only contains even powers of @xmath82 .",
    "it is due to the hydrodynamic couplings , which induce a non - analytic dependence on @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , the negative sign of @xmath83 suggests the possibility of an instability of the membrane @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let us first consider a free membrane .",
    "there is no tension , and @xmath84 .",
    "the membrane is unstable because the average squared undulation is negative at low wave vector . in the case of a vesicle",
    ", there is a finite tension , which can be seen as a lagrange multiplier ensuring the conservation of its area .",
    "the vesicle is unstable if the total tension is low enough to satisfy the condition @xmath85 .",
    "this instability occurs at a wave vector @xmath86 suggesting a periodic deformation of the membrane at this characteristic wave vector .",
    "as expected , the instability threshold for the membrane tension increases with the ion fluxes or the applied potential difference .",
    "\\(iii ) the value of the renormalized membrane tension @xmath87 can also be obtained from the zeroth order electrostatic potential , with a simple mechanical argument .",
    "indeed , the surface tension is related to the maxwell stress by @xcite : @xmath88.\\ ] ] note that in the r.h.s . of eq.[surfacetension ] , the second term cancels a contribution proportional to @xmath3 in the first term , which originates from the existence of a pressure gradient in the fluid .",
    "\\(iv ) for order - of - magnitude estimates , we obtain with the parameters reported in fig  [ fig:2 ] , @xmath89 jm@xmath90 , @xmath91 jm@xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "although the ion flux is consequent and typical of ion channels , the moduli @xmath87 , @xmath83 and @xmath94 are very small due to the strong dependance of these moduli on @xmath95 , which is here only 2.3 nm . as we show below , these low values also reflect the fact that sofar , we have neglected the bilayer character of the membrane and its finite capacitance .",
    "in this section , we extend the calculation to a bilayer of finite thickness @xmath96 and dielectric constant @xmath97 .",
    "there is then an electrical coupling between the membrane and the surrounding electrolyte , with a strength measured by the parameter @xmath98  @xcite . for equilibrium membranes , the importance of this coupling",
    "is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we only discuss the case of symmetric electrolytes : @xmath76 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 because we intend to provide the full solution and more details in a longer paper .",
    "we denote by @xmath101 the internal potential and @xmath0 the electrolyte potential .",
    "when @xmath102 , the boundary conditions at the membrane are modified , they are now : @xmath103 where the first equation is the continuity condition for the normal electric displacement and the second equation is the continuity condition of the potential . with these assumptions , we find that the current - voltage relation given in eq .",
    "[ current ] still holds for any value of @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , the electric field for @xmath105 ( resp .",
    "@xmath106 ) is @xmath107 ( resp .",
    "@xmath108 ) , while the internal field is constant and equal to @xmath109 .",
    "we have introduced @xmath110 the surface charge on the positive electrode , @xmath110,which is related to the electrical current @xmath111 in a way similar to eq .",
    "[ surfacechargedef ] by @xmath112 , and @xmath113 defined by @xmath114 .",
    "these two surface charges are related by @xmath115 .",
    "note that only the diffusion time of the ions within a debye layer enters in @xmath110 whereas @xmath113 also contains the rc characteristic time of the membrane .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ surfacetension ] and the equations above , the surface tension can now be written as the sum of an internal contribution @xmath116 and an external contribution @xmath117 .",
    "the negative contribution @xmath118 is known as the lippmann tension  @xcite and is usually larger in absolute value than @xmath119 .",
    "because of @xmath118 , the total membrane tension @xmath120 can become negative at some critical value of the internal field @xmath121 , which leads to the instabilities discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as discussed in the previous section , the surface tension @xmath87",
    "can also be recovered by solving stokes equation at first order in the membrane height with the appropriate electrostatic forces as source terms .",
    "care must be used here as the usual definition of the ( bulk ) electrostatic force @xmath122 holds only inside a medium with a homogeneous dielectric constant , but not at the boundaries between two dielectric media , where the jump in dielectric constant is associated with a localized force .",
    "these difficulties can be resolved by calculating the electrostatic force directly with the maxwell stress tensor @xcite . from the solution of stokes equation ,",
    "the velocity is obtained everywhere in the domain @xmath123 . by extrapolating this velocity at @xmath1 , an effective free energy of the same form as in eq .",
    "is obtained , with the same tension @xmath87 as calculated from eq .",
    "[ surfacetension ] .",
    "we also obtain the moduli @xmath124 and @xmath94 which is a complicated quadratic function of @xmath110 and @xmath113 .",
    "we now discuss the limit of small conductance @xmath125 which is of experimental relevance . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath126 since there is no current in the medium @xmath127 .",
    "the membrane is a capacitor of surface charge @xmath128 .",
    "this means that the equivalent circuit is made of three planar capacitors in series , one being the membrane ( of capacitance per unit area @xmath129 ) and the other two corresponding to the debye layers on each side ( of capacitance @xmath130 per unit area ) , making up a total capacitance @xmath131",
    ". now @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath134 since the system is at equilibrium and therefore the effective free energy must be of the helfrich form . with the values of the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] except for @xmath135 which we take to be g=@xmath136 and @xmath137 nm , @xmath138 , we obtain @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath141 jm@xmath90 , @xmath142 jm@xmath90 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "if we use instead @xmath145/m@xmath146 a typical value for ion channels , the order of magnitude of the tension and bending modulus are unchanged and a small value of @xmath147 jm@xmath92 is found .",
    "this indicates that the capacitor model with @xmath148 is a good approximation to calculate the moduli in this case .",
    "the importance of capacitive effects is confirmed by the fact that the values of the moduli obtained here are much larger than the ones obtained previously in the case of zero thickness .",
    "furthermore , by varying the ionic strength in the case where ion transport is present with @xmath149 , we have found that the capacitor model holds at high ionic strength but become invalid at low ionic strength where ion transport has a stronger impact on the moduli .",
    "this will be discussed in a future work .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the steady - state fluctuations of a membrane driven out - of - equilibrium by an applied dc electric field or by concentration gradients .",
    "one of our most notable results is the presence of a new term proportional to @xmath81 in the fluctuation spectrum that we interpret as arising from hydrodynamics couplings . for a free membrane or for a vesicle of zero thickness and negligible",
    "dielectric constant , we have found a negative value for @xmath83 which gives rise to a finite wavelength instability . for a bilayer , we recover a known zero wavevector instability , when the surface tension becomes negative . since @xmath83 is positive in this case , the other instability at finite wavelength is absent for a bilayer .",
    "we have also analyzed the role of capacitive effects , and found that they lead to a dominant contribution in the electrostatic part of the surface tension and bending modulus at high ionic strength .",
    "the analysis presented here suggests directions for future study",
    ". in particular , it would be interesting to go beyond the linear approximation for the electrostatic potential and the ion concentrations , and discuss with more details the implications for the dynamics of active membranes containing for instance gated or mechano - sensitive ion channels .",
