    "boundary - value problems in thick junctions are mathematical models of widely used engineering and industrial constructions as well as many other physical and biological systems with very distinct characteristic scales . in recent years , a rich collection of new results on asymptotic analysis of boundary - value problems in thick multi - structures is appeared ( see @xcite@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we homogenize the signorini problem in a thick plane junction of type @xmath5 using the integral identity method developed in @xcite .",
    "a thick junction ( or thick multi - structure ) of type @xmath6  is the union of some domain in @xmath7 which is called the junction s body , and a large number of @xmath8-periodically situated thin domains along some manifolds on the boundary of the junction s body ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this manifold is called the joint zone . here",
    "@xmath8 is a small parameter , which characterizes the distance between neighboring thin domains and their thickness .",
    "the type @xmath6 of a thick junction refers respectively to the limiting dimensions of the body , the joint zone , and each of the attached thin domains .",
    "this classification of thick junctions was given in @xcite@xcite and @xcite , where rigorous mathematical methods were developed ( homogenization , approximation , asymptotic expansions ) for analyzing the main boundary - value problems in thick junctions of different types .",
    "it was pointed out that qualitative properties of solutions essentially depend on the junction type and on the conditions given on the boundaries of the attached thin domains .",
    "in addition , as it was shown in @xcite such problems lose the coercitivity as @xmath9 and this creates special difficulties in the asymptotic investigation .",
    "it should be noted that papers @xcite are the first papers in this direction .",
    "for the first time a problem known now as the signorini problem was considered by signorini himself in @xcite .",
    "the sense of the signorini boundary condition consists in a priori ignorance which of the boundary conditions ( dirichlet or neumann ) are satisfied and where .",
    "many interesting problems in applied mathematics involve the signorini boundary conditions .",
    "applications arise in groundwater hydrology , in plasticity theory , in crack theory , in optimal control problems , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "such of these problems as can be recast as variational inequalities become relatively easy to study ( see @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "asymptotic investigations of variational inequalities in perforated domains were made in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the results of this preprint will be published in @xcite .",

    "obviously , the thin rods fill out the rectangle @xmath21 in the limit passage as @xmath22    let us denote the union of vertical sides of the thin rods @xmath23 by @xmath24  the union of bases of the thin rods will be denoted by @xmath25 .    in @xmath0",
    "we consider the following boundary value problem @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the outward normal derivative ,  @xmath28 are given functions .",

    "we can regard that @xmath43 in @xmath44 multiplying the equation of problem ( [ 1.1 ] ) by the function @xmath45 integrating by parts in @xmath0 and taking into account the boundary conditions for @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48    now we take any function @xmath49 and multiply the equation of the problem ( [ 1.1 ] ) by @xmath50 similar as before we get @xmath51 @xmath52 since @xmath53 and @xmath54 a.e . in @xmath55 @xmath56 taking into account ( [ 2.3 ] ) , it follows from equality ( [ 2.2 ] ) that @xmath57    [ def-1 ] a function @xmath58 is called a weak solution to problem ( [ 1.1 ] ) if it satisfies the integral equality ( [ 2.1 ] ) and integral inequality ( [ 2.4 ] ) for arbitrary function @xmath59    another definition is as follows .",

    "it is well known ( see for instance @xcite@xcite ) that there exists a unique solution of inequality  ( [ ozn2.5 ] ) for any fixed value of @xmath42",
    "to homogenize boundary - value problems in thick multi - structures with the nonhomogeneous neumann or fourier conditions on the boundaries of the thin attached domains the method of special integral identities was proposed in @xcite . for our problem this identity is as follows ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "we see that the homogenized problem ( [ limit - problem ] ) is a non - standard boundary - value problem that consists of the poisson equation in the junction body @xmath110 the variational inequalities in @xmath111 and the transmission conditions in the joint zone @xmath112 therefore , at first we give the definition of the weak solution to this problem and then with the help of general approach in the theory of variational inequalities we prove the existence and uniqueness .",
    "let us introduce partly anisotropic sobolev space @xmath113 where @xmath114 is defined in ( [ 5.1 ] ) .",
    "it follows from properties of anisotropic sobolev spaces ( see @xcite ) that the traces of the restrictions @xmath115 and @xmath116 on @xmath117 are equal .",
    "in addition , since traces of functions from @xmath118 vanish on @xmath119 there exists a constant @xmath120 such that @xmath121 in @xmath118 we introduce a norm @xmath122 , which is generated by a scalar product @xmath123      [ def-3 ] a function @xmath127 is called a weak solution of problem ( [ limit - problem ] ) if it satisfies the integral equality @xmath128 and the integral inequality @xmath129 for arbitrary function @xmath130    if there exists a classical solution to the homogenized problem ( [ limit - problem ] ) , then relations ( [ def3.1 ] ) and ( [ def3.2 ] ) can be obtained by the same way as relations ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] ) in definition  [ def-1 ] .",
    "similarly as we proved the equivalence of definitions  [ def-1 ] and  [ def-2 ] , we can show the equivalence of definition  [ def-3 ] to the following definition .",
    "let us prove that definition  [ def-4 ] and definition  [ def-5 ] are equivalent .",
    "adding the inequality @xmath136 to inequality ( [ def4.1 ] ) , we get ( [ def5.1 ] ) .",

    "thus , all definitions  [ def-3 ] , [ def-4 ] and [ def-5 ] are equivalent .",
    "we can re - write inequality ( [ def4.1 ] ) in the following form @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a linear continuous functional on @xmath118 defined by the formulae @xmath145 using the theory of variational inequalities in hilbert spaces ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) ) , we can state that there exists a unique solution of the inequality ( [ 5.3 ] ) and consequently of the homogenized problem  ( [ limit - problem ] ) .        from ( [ 4.7 ] ) it follows that @xmath146 @xmath147 and @xmath148 @xmath149 therefore we can choose a subsequence @xmath150 ( again denoted by @xmath8 ) , such that @xmath151 \\widetilde{u}_\\varepsilon & \\stackrel{w}{\\longrightarrow } & h\\,u_0^{- }      & \\mbox{weakly in}\\ \\ l^2(d_0 ) , \\\\[2 mm ] \\widetilde{\\partial _ { x_i}u_\\varepsilon } & \\stackrel{w}{\\longrightarrow}&\\gamma _ i & \\mbox{weakly in}\\ \\ l^2(d_0 ) , \\quad i=1,2 , \\end{array } \\right\\ } \\quad \\text{as } \\quad \\varepsilon \\to 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 are some functions which will be determined later .    at first",
