    "the higgs boson discovered at the lhc has opened a new chapter for particle physics . during the current phase of lhc running ,",
    "the higgs couplings need to be studied precisely in order to distinguish a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson from a scalar forming part of an enlarged higgs sector ( beyond the sm ) .",
    "yukawa interactions provide channels to probe higgs properties in a very direct way . in this work we concentrate on higgs boson",
    "decays into a charged lepton pair , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which can be studied at the lhc or future colliders such as fcc , ilc and cepc . within the sm the tau - lepton coupling to the higgs boson",
    "is uniquely determined by its mass , the yukawa lagrangian being given by @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the left handed sm lepton doublet , @xmath8 the right handed lepton singlet , @xmath9 is the scalar higgs doublet and @xmath10 are generation indices .",
    "the fields @xmath7 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 transform under the sm gauge group @xmath12 as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the leptons acquire a mass when electroweak symmetry is broken and the higgs field develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath16 , @xmath17  gev , in which case eq.([lyuk ] ) becomes @xmath18 the yukawa interaction in the lepton mass eigenstate basis is obtained from eq.([lyuk2 ] ) with a bi - unitary transformation @xmath19 . in this basis",
    "the higgs - lepton couplings , given by @xmath20 , are proportional to the lepton masses , flavor diagonal and real .",
    "they are also cp conserving and given by the well known expression , @xmath21    the cms collaboration has reported a possible lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) signal of the form @xmath0 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "if confirmed , this implies that the higgs sector must have new flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions , beyond eq.([yuksm ] ) .",
    "lfv higgs decays have been discussed using the effective lagrangian framework by a number of authors @xcite , as well as in the context of two higgs doublet models @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "when new physics introduces this type of coupling , @xmath23 , in general , it also brings in a cp violating component into the flavor diagonal higgs - lepton couplings , which are parametrized as @xmath24 it is well known that the simultaneous existence of scalar and pseudo - scalar couplings in eq.([cpv ] ) induces a cp violating spin - spin correlation that can in principle be measured for tau - leptons and muons , which have weak decays that analyze their polarization @xcite . in the standard treatment of this problem",
    ", one can define a density matrix @xmath25 for the production of polarized tau - leptons with polarization described by a unit polarization vector @xmath26 in the @xmath27-rest frame . with the amplitude in eq.([cpv ] )",
    "the cp violating part of the density matrix is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a normalization constant and @xmath30 is the three momentum direction of the tau - lepton . beyond tree - level , @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 acquire imaginary parts and the density matrix has additional terms that we will not consider in this paper .",
    "the existence of cp violation in the higgs interaction may have far reaching implications for why our universe is dominated by matter over anti - matter ( baryon asymmetric universe - bau ) . in the sm cp violation",
    "resides only in the charged current interaction of w bosons with fermions and is known to be too small to solve the bau problem .",
    "searches for cp violation in higgs interactions are therefore an important topic in particle physics even if the mechanism by which new physics gives rise to lfv and cpv interactions of higgs with fermions is not understood .",
    "in a recent paper we have illustrated this discussion in a model independent manner using the language of effective lagrangians @xcite . for completeness , we begin by repeating this argument before presenting in the next section an implementation within specific multi - higgs models .    assuming that there are no new particles below a few hundred gev , one can describe deviations from the sm higgs couplings using an effective lagrangian that respects the symmetries of the sm @xcite . at leading order , with operators of dimension six ,",
    "one already finds the following term that modifies eq.([lyuk ] ) , @xmath33 the matrix @xmath34 is , in general , non - diagonal and complex . expanding this lagrangian in combination with eq.([lyuk ] )",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking gives , @xmath35 as already mentioned , there is a bi - unitary transformation that diagonalizes the mass terms , which in this case are @xmath36 but it is evident that it no longer diagonalizes the @xmath37 couplings as @xmath38 remains an arbitrary complex matrix except for special forms of the matrix @xmath39 .",
    "one way to check this is to use the fritzsch ansatz @xcite for the @xmath40 and treat the @xmath34 as small corrections as suggested by the prefactor @xmath41 .",
    "to relate the magnitudes of @xmath42 and @xmath1 one needs a specific model for the @xmath34 matrix .",
    "if the deviations from the sm are small , as suggested by the effective lagrangian framework , it is conventional to write eq.([cpv ] ) in terms of these deviations , @xmath43 . using eq.([fulyuk ] ) , for the tau - lepton , for example , this means , @xmath44    the dimension six operators mentioned above are not renormalizable and it is desirable to have a uv complete theory . in the next section",
    "we study renormalizable theoretical models in which a bsm interaction can induce large @xmath2 and cp violation in @xmath45 decay .",
    "there are different types of models where the higgs interaction with fermions can violate flavor and cp .",
    "we will concentrate on models that single out the third generation which we have discussed and motivated previously .",
    "in the sm , when diagonalizing the mass terms , the yukawa couplings are also diagonalized , so there are no fcnc nor cp violation . however , the existence of the flavor changing couplings @xmath47 does not necessarily imply cp violating couplings as well . in more complicated models where",
    "the yukawa couplings have off - diagonal entries which allow @xmath48 to occur , the diagonal entries may still be real implying no cp violation of the type in eq.([cpv ] ) .",
    "a simple way to obtain the cp violating interaction of the type in eq.([cpv ] ) is to mix the scalar and pseudo - scalar components in the higgs potential via spontaneous or explicit cp violation @xcite .",
    "conversely , it is also possible to have cp violation without fcnc in multi - higgs doublet models , like the weinberg model of spontaneous cp violation @xcite which can not induce @xmath2 .",
    "type - iii two higgs doublet models , on the other hand , are able to accommodate both effects .",
    "such models have been studied before in detail @xcite and this will not be the main thrust of our paper .",
    "we will show two models motivated by treating the third generation differently from the first two generations to reduce the hierarchy problem in the yukawa sector : the @xmath49 and the non - universal left - right @xmath50 have the right features .",
    "the former provides a concrete example with flavor changing couplings @xmath47 , yet no cp violation in @xmath1 decay , while the latter has both lfv and cpv higgs couplings .",
    "the @xmath49 model treats the first two and the third generations differently , by assuming that the usual @xmath51 for the first two generations is replaced by @xmath52 and for the third generation it is replaced by @xmath53 .",
    "the left - handed quark doublets @xmath54 , the right - handed quark singlets @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the left - handed lepton doublets @xmath57 , and the right - handed charged leptons @xmath58 transform under the gauge group as @xmath59 where the numbers in each bracket are the quantum numbers of the corresponding field under @xmath60 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the superscript on each field labels the generation of the fermion .",
    "the model and most of its associated phenomenology have been described in the literature before @xcite , here we concentrate on the scalar sector which will be responsible for the effects we want .",
    "symmetry breaking of @xmath62 down to the usual @xmath51 is achieved by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath63 , of order @xmath64(tev ) , of a bi - doublet scalar @xmath65 .",
    "the fermion masses are provided by the subsequent symmetry breaking achieved by two higgs doublets @xmath66 and @xmath67 with respective vevs @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 only couple to the first two and the third left - handed fermions , respectively . in general this extension of the sm produces fcnc at tree level by exchanging physical neutral higgs scalars .",
    "it also produces fcnc due to the exchange of @xmath72 and @xmath73 as discussed in the literature but this effect will not concern us here .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian , including leptons , is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 . in the above",
    ", @xmath76 takes values of 1 and 2 , and @xmath77 takes values of 1 , 2 , and 3 . depending on whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles , neutrino masses can be generated by introducing right handed neutrinos @xmath78 to give neutrino dirac masses .",
    "if one also allows @xmath78 to have a majorana mass , then the type - i seesaw mechanism is used to give neutrino masses . since",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 give masses to the first two and the third generations , @xmath79 should be much smaller than @xmath80 so that the hierarchy in yukawa couplings can be reduced .",
    "it is convenient to work in a rotated basis for the scalar doublets @xmath81 where only one higgs boson develops a non - zero vev , with @xmath82 , @xmath83    in this basis , we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the goldstone bosons .",
    "one can write the neutral higgs boson couplings to charged leptons as @xmath87 where @xmath88 note that the structure of the model with two vevs , of which @xmath79 enters the first two diagonal elements of @xmath89 and @xmath80 enters the third one allows one to significantly reduce the hierarchy in @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 as compared to the sm case by selecting @xmath93 .",
    "however , since @xmath79 contributes to both the first and the second generation masses , a ( reduced ) hierarchical structure in @xmath94 and @xmath34 is still needed .",
    "eq.([aux1 ] ) becomes in the fermion mass eigenstate basis , @xmath95 where @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 being unitary matrices and @xmath99 the lepton mass eigenstate matrix .",
    "@xmath100 is given by @xmath101    the scalar @xmath102 is approximately the sm higgs like particle , but it is not yet a mass eigenstate of the higgs potential because in general , @xmath102 and @xmath103 mix with each other . on the other hand , the higgs potential for this model is constructed with the fields @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath71 which are the only ones needed for symmetry breaking , and does not have mixing between the @xmath106 and the @xmath102 or @xmath107 states @xcite .",
    "the scalar mass eigenstates @xmath108 can then be written in terms of @xmath102 and @xmath103 with a mixing angle @xmath109 as usual @xmath110    if we now identify @xmath111 with the 125 gev state observed by the lhc collider , the yukawa coupling between charged leptons and @xmath111 takes the form @xmath112    inspecting the above equation , one sees that the @xmath113 and @xmath114 entries are non - zero in general , and thus allow @xmath115 to occur .",
    "naively , one may also expect that the @xmath116 entry which contributes to @xmath45 can be complex indicating a cp violating coupling of the type in eq.([cpv ] ) .",
    "this is , however , not true . when diagonalizing the mass matrix above , the phase of the @xmath116 entry in @xmath100 is automatically removed leading to a cp conserving @xmath117 coupling . to prove this , it is sufficient to show that in the mass eigenstate basis , the 33 entry of @xmath118 is real .    from @xmath119",
    ", we have @xmath120 which leads to @xmath121 at the same time , expanding @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath122 since @xmath123 is normalized to be real , so is @xmath118 .    to also have cp violation in @xmath124 decay , one needs to modify the yukawa structure of the model in such a way that the couplings responsible for flavor changing @xmath125 decays can not be written in the form given in eq.([flavor ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing one more higgs doublet transforming as either @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "the additional fields introduce additional couplings in the yukawa and higgs potentials which allow the mixing of @xmath106 with @xmath102 and @xmath107 , for example .",
    "they can also allow the resulting @xmath128 coupling to be complex from the structure of the yukawa couplings alone .",
    "we will not pursue this avenue here , but instead we provide a different model with the latter feature , the non - universal left - right model , in the next subsection .",
    "the gauge group of the non - universal left - right model is @xmath129 .",
    "the quantum numbers for the first two and the third generations are chosen to be different in such a way that right handed interactions are enhanced for third generation fermions and suppressed for the first two generations .",
    "this is motivated by the large top - quark mass , the possible anomalies that have been observed in @xmath130 and @xmath4 couplings @xcite , and the stringent constraints that exist on the couplings of the lighter fermions .",
    "the left - handed quark doublets @xmath54 , the right - handed quark singlets @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the left - handed lepton doublets @xmath57 , and the right - handed charged leptons @xmath58 transform under the original gauge group as @xmath131 the model and many aspects of its phenomenology have been discussed before in the literature @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the relevant scalar - lepton interactions .",
    "there are three scalar fields affecting yukawa couplings which we list below together with their transformation properties under the gauge group , @xmath132 the yukawa couplings that can be constructed with these fields are @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .    as in the previous example",
    ", the higgs potential in this model does not allow mixing between the scalars and pseudo - scalars , therefore the 125 gev higgs boson will be a linear combination of @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . to find the yukawa coupling of the 125 gev higgs boson to the charged leptons , one needs to understand how @xmath139 couple to the charged leptons in the basis where the neutrino mass matrix has been diagonalized .",
    "one can write the lepton yukawa couplings as follows @xmath140e_r + { \\rm h.c.}\\;. \\label{lepyuklr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this we can read the charged lepton mass matrix , @xmath141    it is convenient to work in a basis where only one higgs has non - zero vev @xmath142 . to do",
    "so we define @xmath143 where @xmath144 .",
    "assuming @xmath97 and @xmath98 diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix , @xmath145 , we have eq.([lepyuklr ] ) in the charged lepton mass eigenstate basis as @xmath146 where the matrices parametrizing the lepton yukawa couplings are now @xmath147    the higgs mass eigenstates can now be written as linear combinations of @xmath148 as @xmath149 in terms of an orthogonal matrix @xmath150 . further identifying the lightest mass eigenstate @xmath151 with the 125 gev higgs boson",
    ", we have @xmath152 in terms of the generic parameters defined in eq.([fulyuk ] ) , we have @xmath153 and the normalized tau couplings @xmath154 and @xmath155 defined in eq.([cpv ] ) are then@xmath156    eq.([gij ] ) is similar to eq.([lhll ] ) .",
    "however , this time there are two terms in @xmath157 which are non - diagonal .",
    "this difference is sufficient to reach opposite conclusions to the previous model : in the mass eigenstate basis @xmath102 can decay to @xmath158 and at the same time the yukawa coupling for @xmath102 to @xmath159 can be complex leading to cp violating coupling of the type in eq.([cpv ] ) .",
    "this model naturally has non - zero values for @xmath31 and @xmath155 simultaneously .",
    "the generic scale of new physics @xmath160 in this model is related to the masses of the heavier scalars .",
    "inspecting eq.([fulyuk ] ) , one might think that the hierarchical structure of the lepton mass matrix is already encoded in the first term so that the flavor structure of the dimension six term , @xmath162 , or eq.([yukmod ] ) within the model of section([modworks ] ) , could be democratic .",
    "furthermore , within the models we are discussing we can choose appropriate values for @xmath163 to reduce the hierarchical structure of the yukawa couplings making democratic @xmath89 matrices plausible .",
    "we would write in this case , @xmath164 and the diagonal elements , in the notation of eq.([gtt ] ) would satisfy @xmath165    however , this may not be the case .",
    "for example , as mentioned before , one still needs to split the first and second generations and hierarchical @xmath89 matrices may still be needed . in this case",
    "we could write following refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath166 and this time the diagonal elements , in the notation of eq.([gtt ] ) would satisfy @xmath167    we will consider the above two cases as benchmarks for discussion in the remaining of the paper .      to explain the cms data for @xmath48 , it is necessary to have non - zero @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we have @xmath170 including loop effects , @xmath171 may have non - zero absorptive part which leads a rate difference between @xmath172 and @xmath173 . however , if the absorptive parts are small , the rate for @xmath172 and @xmath173 will be approximately equal .",
    "these couplings have been studied in connection with the cms report @xcite @xmath174 when the absorptive parts in @xmath175 are neglected , one obtains @xmath176 the two benchmark flavor structures in eqs.([option1 ] ) and ( [ option2 ] ) thus imply    * democratic @xmath177 * hierarchical @xmath178    we can also use the measured rates @xmath1 and @xmath179 from the atlas - cms combination @xcite assuming that there is no new physics .",

    "the allowed range encompasses @xmath189 @xcite and yields a 95% upper bound that is four times larger ( weaker constraint ) than the cms result quoted above .    with some relatively weak constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath155",
    ", one may wonder whether a large @xmath4 edm @xmath190 can be generated .",
    "we have checked this possibility and found that since the contribution to @xmath190 from eq.([cpv ] ) is proportional to @xmath191 , the current upper limit @xmath192 e.cm does not constrain @xmath193 significantly .",
    "our numerical constraints are summarized in figure  [ fig ] .",
    "the panel on the left corresponds to the democratic flavor scenario .",
    "we see in this case that the most restrictive bounds arise from the limits on @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "this is due to the much smaller sm yukawa couplings for electrons and muons relative to tau - leptons , which significantly enhance the effects of democratic absolute deviations from the sm in the relative couplings @xmath196 probed by experiment .",
    "we see in this case that the maximum allowed value of the ratio that quantifies cp violation is @xmath197 the panel on right corresponds to the hierarchical flavor scenario . in this case",

    "@xcite , and in the next section we compare some possible cp - odd asymmetries for that purpose .",
    "as discussed above , the couplings @xmath202 and @xmath203 in eq.([cpv ] ) give rise to a cp violating spin - spin correlation as in eq.([spinspin ] ) .",
    "the polarizations of @xmath4 and @xmath204 can be extracted in principle by studying the angular distributions of their decay . in this section",
    "we will study the relative sensitivity of the different tau - lepton decay modes to cp violation at a more theoretical level by comparing the t - odd correlations for each case .",
    "experimental study of these correlations requires the reconstruction of the higgs rest frame , which in the di - tau mode , is not possible at lhc .",
    "they are thus better suited for study at an @xmath205 collider .",
    "for example , an ilc or cpec running at 250  gev would produce the higgs through the @xmath206 reaction and modes that reconstruct the @xmath72 completely ( such as the di - muon mode ) will allow full reconstruction of the higgs rest frame @xcite .",
    "a full phenomenological analysis of how these asymmetries could be measured is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "@xcite , resulting in @xmath219 of course this is just the raw asymmetry as the neutrino momenta can not be measured .",
    "it represents the largest possible asymmetry in this mode as there are dilution factors when the triple product is projected onto observable momenta .",

    "the table shows only leptonic decays on the @xmath227 side , but we also checked that the conjugated modes have the same asymmetries .",

    "in the sm the higgs boson does not have lfv decays and its decays conserve cp .",
    "we have argued generically that if one goes bsm to allow lfv decays of the higgs such as the one suggested by a recent cms result , one also introduces cp violation .",
    "the only channel where it is in principle possible to study this cp violation at lhc is @xmath1 and we have studied the relative sensitivity of different tau - lepton decay modes to cp violating couplings . we have constructed to specific multi - higgs models in which the 125 gev higgs can have lfv decays and argued that only one of them exhibits cp violation as well .",
    "these two examples illustrate the different ingredients that are needed for both effects to appear bsm .",
    "the correlation between lfv and cpv couplings depends on the details of the flavour sector bsm and we have considered two benchmark scenarios . in the first one ,",
    "the lepton flavor sector has a dominant hierarchical structure that produces the charged lepton masses , but the deviations from this are democratic .",

    "this constraint is consistent with the upper bound on lfv from cms , and allows for a cp violating asymmetry as large as 11% .    in the second benchmark scenario we assumed the corrections to the sm lepton flavor sector",
