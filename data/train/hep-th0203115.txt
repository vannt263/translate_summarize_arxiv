    "consistent generally covariant actions are known to exist only for fields with spin less than or equal to two .",
    "however , we know that string theory contains an infinite tower of states with all sorts of higher spin representations .",
    "thus for example , to establish a connection between the superstring theory and the low energy effective field theories ( for these higher spin particles ) one needs to make progress in understanding higher spin gauge field theories . a natural first step towards this",
    "would be to construct gauge invariant actions for fields ( of arbitrary representations ) in anti - de sitter ( ads ) background .",
    "ads is compatible with supersymmetry ( see for eg .",
    "@xcite ) and interacting massless fields can consistently propagate @xcite in it . studying fields ( field equations and actions ) of arbitrary representations in anti -",
    "de sitter or de sitter ( ds ) background is also important in the context of ads / cft correspondence @xcite . however , this task has eluded physicists for a long time although progress have been made in specific dimensions and/or for specific representations .    in this paper",
    "we present a simple and elegant solution to this problem in its full generality and then work out some examples .",
    "first we obtain the field equations for the field strengths ( of gauge fields ) of arbitrary representations in ( anti-)de sitter space - time of arbitrary dimension and then construct their gauge invariant action , both by what we call `` radial dimensional reduction '' of one higher dimensional flat space - time .",
    "further , we believe that this prescription relates theories in flat space - time with that of ds or ads space - time in a much more general sense .",
    "the earliest effort in trying to relate theories on ds / ads space - time with that of flat space - time was by dirac @xcite where he discussed field equations for scalars , vectors and spin half fermions .",
    "results for massless multiplets in flat space - time @xcite were derived using group ( conformal ) theoretic techniques and first quantized brst methods .",
    "our efforts to directly apply these procedures to ds / ads space - time failed and we realised that perhaps we have to invoke extra dimensions to make it work .",
    "we therefore set out to try and mimic the construction of massive flat space - time multiplets which were obtained by dimensional reduction of the massless flat space - time multiplets in one higher dimension @xcite . at first sight the generalization to the ds / ads case may appear impossible because we did not have the massless ds / ads multiplets to begin with .",
    "however we know that ds / ads in say d dimensions can adequately be described as a hypersurface ( `` sphere '' ) in d+1 dimensional flat space - time with appropriate signature .",
    "thus we can start with a d+1 dimensional flat space - time but instead of dimensionally reducing a flat direction ( which would give us the massive flat space - time multiplets ) we can reduce the radial coordinate which should then give us ds / ads .",
    "this geometric picture was the basic motivation behind our construction and it works !    a more detailed analysis , however , reveals that in order that this procedure work for both field equations and action we need another crucial ingredient , that of scale invariance , and this is where geometry gives way to algebra .",
    "for the reduction of the field equations to work we need a generator which commutes not only with the isometry group of the ds / ads hypersurface but also with the field equations .",
    "indeed we have such a generator , the dilatation , which is not the same as the radial momentum as one would naively expect but closely related to it .",
    "a simple way to reduce actions is to compactify the extra coordinate .",
    "if the original action is scale invariant then the various `` harmonic modes '' ( corresponding to the eigenfunctions of the dilatation ) decouple from one another to give us separate d dimensional ads / ds actions corresponding to each mode .",
    "fortunately , the massless flat d+1 dimensional gauge invariant action is also scale invariant .",
    "it is clear then that instead of choosing eigenspaces of the radial momentum operator ( @xmath0 ) to reduce the hilbert space ( to d dimensions ) we have to choose eigenspaces of the dilatation ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "dilatation now plays the role that the momentum generator in the extra flat direction plays in the usual compactification scheme .",
    "@xmath2 thus in the comparison between the usual reduction scheme and our scheme , the appropriate analogue of @xmath3 , the extra flat coordinate is @xmath4 and not @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , the appropriate `` radial compactification '' in analogy with the usual `` toroidal compactification '' will be given by @xmath6    through radial dimensional reduction we obtain both the field equations and action for the various field representations .",
    "we observe that the fields which start out as representations of so(d,1 ) or so(d-1,2 ) contains a set of several irreducible representations ( irreps . ) of so(d-1,1 ) or so(d-1,1 ) respectively for ds / ads .",
    "another way of saying this is that massive ds / ads multiplets contain several irreps .",
    "of flat space - time , which corroborates our previous understanding .",
    "of course for some special mass values these multiplets may decouple into smaller multiplets @xcite as we shall see in the examples .    in section 1",
    ", we explain the procedure of radial dimensional reduction in more detail . in section 2 , we obtain the field equations for the field strengths of gauge fields in d dimensional ds / ads background by dimensional reduction of the d+1 dimensional flat space - time field equations .",
    "we also derive the lightcone form of the ads generators by solving the field equations and imposing the light - cone constraints , and check that it agrees with the already known results @xcite . in section 3 , we obtain the gauge invariant action ( for both fermions and bosons ) in ds / ads background , and in section 4 we work out some simple examples for which results are already known . in section 5",
    "we briefly discuss possible generalizations of radial dimensional reduction to interacting theories .",
    "finally we conclude by commenting on possible future research .",
    "* the generic structure : * our starting point will be the results that were derived for massless multiplets in flat space - time which was first obtained for symmetric representations for both bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite and later on generalised to arbitrary representations @xcite using brst methods . a straightforward attempt to generalise the flat space - time derivation @xcite for ds / ads fails . for example , we can indeed obtain field equations that are invariant under the ds / ads symmetry group but their algebra does not close ( i.e. the commutators of the field equations produce newer ones ) . after adding sufficient field equations ,",
    "so that the algebra closes , we end up getting the conformal field equations , which describe only the conformal multiplets !",
    "the failure made us realise that perhaps we have to introduce extra dimensions to make the group theoretic methods work , just as one has to in order to obtain massive multiplets in flat space - time .",
    "let us then investigate the general scheme of dimensional reduction",
    ".    suppose we want to obtain the field equations and action for fields on a d dimensional maximally isometric manifold @xmath7 which can be described as a hypersurface in a d+1 dimensional flat space - time with appropriate signature .",
    "our first objective then is to find field representations of the isometry group ( @xmath8 ) of @xmath7 .",
    "we can achieve this by dimensional reduction if    i. : :    we have a group @xmath9 isomorphic to the isometry group    of @xmath7 with generators @xmath10    acting on the d+1 dimensional flat manifold which leave the    hypersurface @xmath7 invariant .",
    "this condition implies that the tangent vector ( as an operator ) , say @xmath11 , which is normal to the hypersurface @xmath7 , commutes with the generators @xmath10 . to make matters concrete",
    "let us choose a coordinate system @xmath12 of the d+1 dimensional flat space such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 , labels the points in @xmath7 while @xmath15 is the coordinate which is constant in @xmath7 .",
    "then the eigenfunctions of @xmath11 given by @xmath16 for a fixed @xmath17 ( lets call the eigenspace @xmath18 ) forms a representation of @xmath9 .",
    "this representation of @xmath9 is still in terms of d+1 dimensional fields but one can easily expand in the eigenstates of @xmath11 , so that we have a one to one mapping between the eigenfunctions of @xmath11 in @xmath18 and d dimensional functions living on the hypersurface @xmath7 .",
    "hence we now have a representation of @xmath8 ( since @xmath9 and @xmath8 are isomorphic ) in terms of d dimensional fields on @xmath7 .",
    "our next task is to find a set @xmath19 of field equations @xmath20 for field strengths of the fields .",
    "it should satisfy the following requirements :    a. : :    the algebra of @xmath21 s should close .",
    "b. : :    @xmath19 should be invariant under @xmath8 , i.e.    @xmath22\\sim f_j$ ]    now suppose we already have a set @xmath23 of field equations @xmath24 for d+1 dimensional field - representations of @xmath9 .",
    "we can perform a dimensional reduction of @xmath23 similar to that of @xmath9 if @xmath23 commutes with @xmath11 as then @xmath23 can be defined on the hypersurface @xmath7 . also , because @xmath23 satisfy ( a ) and ( b ) for d+1 dimensional flat space they automatically satisfy them for @xmath7 .",
    "( remember @xmath9 and @xmath8 has been identified . )",
    "thus we need the following further hypotheses to make the field equations work :    iia .",
    ": :    there should exist a set of field equations    @xmath25 whose algebra closes .",
    ": :    @xmath23 should be invariant under @xmath9 ,    i.e. @xmath26\\sim \\hat{f}_j$ ] iic .",
    ": :    @xmath23 commutes    leaves @xmath23 invariant we can find another suitable    set @xmath27 which will commute with @xmath11 and    satisfies all other requirements . ] with @xmath11 or in other    words @xmath23 leaves @xmath7 invariant .",
    "next we turn our attention to the action . again",
    ", if already we have a gauge invariant action for d+1 dimensional field representations which is also invariant under @xmath9 , then after dimensional reduction we should get an action which is still gauge invariant and `` @xmath8-invariant '' .",
    "however , for this to be true the partial integrations that we need to perform ( to prove gauge invariance for example ) should still work , even for eigenfunctions of @xmath11 which do not necessarily vanish at @xmath28 .",
    "the most natural way to ensure that the total derivative terms vanish is to compactify the extra coordinate @xmath15 : @xmath29 since the original action is invariant under @xmath30 the various harmonic modes decouple in the action and we obtain separate actions for each mode .",
    "these modes now live in the d dimensional hypersurface @xmath7 .",
    "note for us @xmath15 does not have any physical significance ( unlike the extra dimensions in kaluza - klein reduction ) and just serves the mathematical purpose of providing us with actions on @xmath7 and hence for example , the relative or overall co - efficients in front of the various `` mode actions '' is unimportant .",
    "the gauge transformations of the various modes can be easily obtained by harmonic expansion of the original gauge transformation .",
    "thus for the dimensional reduction of the action to work we further need :    iii .",
    ": :    d+1 dimensional flat gauge invariant action to be invariant under    @xmath11 .    with the general understanding of how the dimensional reduction works we can now specialise to the case of reducing d+1 dimensional flat space - time with signature @xmath31 to d dimensional ds / ads .",
    "in this case the role of @xmath15 is played by the `` radial coordinate '' @xmath5 , or more precisely @xmath32 , while @xmath11 is the dilatation generator @xmath33 . to make things clear let us choose a particular coordinate system : @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the flat d+1 dimensional coordinates with metric @xmath37 . in the metric @xmath38 corresponds to ds , while @xmath39 corresponds to ads . to be sure",
    "one can easily compute the metric element in this coordinate system : @xmath40 clearly the @xmath7 hypersurface has the familiar metric of ds / ads space - time . as perhaps now one can guess that the role of @xmath9 will be played by the lorentz generators of the d+1 dimensional flat space - time .",
    "as usual the lorentz generators have an orbital piece and a spin piece .",
    "( in our paper we refer to the spin piece as spin operators , and by `` spin - fields '' we refer to the fields which are representations of these d+1 dimensional spin operators .",
    "the spin value of the spin - fields then corresponds to the casimir operator @xmath41 . ) we know that @xmath42 or @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and is precisely the isometry group of ds / ads .",
    "these obviously commute with the dilatation @xmath33 and thus condition ( i ) is satisfied . to see how the lorentz generators look after reduction one needs the inverse coordinate transformation : @xmath45 one can then compute the partial derivatives : @xmath46\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x^n}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta x_m}{(1+{\\textstyle{1\\over 2}}\\eta x^2)}\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}r}\\]]and @xmath47 we know the orbital piece ( which corresponds to the killing vector ) of the lorentz generators in terms of @xmath36 coordinates : @xmath48}}\\ ] ] then using ( 5),(6 ) and ( 7 ) we find @xmath49 } } ; \\hspace{5 mm } l_{dm}=\\frac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x^m}-\\frac{1}{2}\\eta\\left(x^2\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x^m}-2x_mx\\cdot{\\partial}\\right)\\right]\\ ] ] one immediately recognises that the orbital pieces of the generators correspond to the killing vectors for ds / ads space - time ( in the given coordinate system , the d dimensional lorentz rotations , and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the momentum generator and @xmath52 the conformal boost . ] ) as we expected .",
    "the killing symmetry generators associated with the killing vectors are then uniquely given by @xmath53}}+s_{mn } ; \\hspace{5 mm } j_{rm}=\\frac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x^m}-{\\textstyle{1\\over 2}}\\eta(x^2\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x^m}-2x_mx.{\\partial}-2 x^ns_{mn})]\\ ] ] clearly these are the ds / ads symmetry generators and they correspond to the full d+1 dimensional lorentz generators in terms of the ones in the new frame ( @xmath54 ) . ] .",
    "thus we now have a representation of the ds / ads isometry generators given by ( 9 ) .",
    "note that the generators are independent of the radial coordinate , which is as it should be . + * the covariant derivative : * now that we know that d dimensional ds / ads can be described as a `` sphere '' in d+1 dimensional flat space - time , we can choose an arbitrary coordinate system on the sphere ( to keep things covariant on @xmath7 ) and proceed to implement the radial dimensional reduction of field equations and actions . since we are now working in a more general coordinate system , we will need the covariant derivatives instead of the partial derivatives ( 6 ) . in this subsection",
    "we compute them .    in this more general",
    "coordinate system the metric element looks like : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is now the ds / ads metric in any arbitrary coordinate system .",
    "it is simpler to work in the vielbein formalism .",
    "we choose our vielbein and its inverse as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vielbein for ds / ads space time and the `` flat metric '' is @xmath59    the covariant derivative in general is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 are the spin connections and @xmath63 are the second quantized spin generators @xcite . however instead of using ( 13 ) , for the simple vielbein matrix ( 11 ) it is easier to compute the covariant derivatives using weyl transformations which is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the weyl gauge parameter .",
    "now consider our case : @xmath66 using ( 14 ) we then obtain @xmath67 now the vielbein @xmath68 is a direct product of the vielbeins for the d dimensional ds / ads and the one - dimensional `` @xmath5 '' space .",
    "thus the covariant derivatives @xmath69 are just the covariant derivatives for ds / ads while @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71 from now on `` hatted '' quantities will denote d+1 dimensional objects , while `` unhatted '' will denote d dimensional objects .",
    "thus we have @xmath72 @xmath73    it is also convenient to work with the `` weyl transformed '' fields , @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the scale dimension for the fields in d+1 dimensions .",
    "then the action of the covariant derivatives on the original fields can be written as @xmath77 @xmath78 where we define @xmath79",
    "* field equations for field strength : * we already have field equations in d+1 flat space - time in flat coordinates @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 first we covariantize ( 23 ) to obtain the equations for flat space - time in a general coordinate system : @xmath82 these equations are not only invariant under @xmath9 satisfying ( iia ) with a closed algebra ( iib ) but also invariant under the scale transformation @xmath33 .",
    "however , for the dimensional reduction to work we need them to commute with @xmath33 ( iic ) . by multiplying the field equations by appropriate scale factors of `` @xmath5 '' this can be achieved and one can easily verify that this scaling does not disturb ( iia ) and ( iib ) .",
    "it turns out that the correct field equations and @xmath83 .",
    "then the fact that the algebra should close and that for the dimension reduction to work the field equations must commute with @xmath33 gives the precise values for the arbitrary functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 . ] are given by @xmath86 now to dimensionally reduce these field equations we have to find out how they act on the eigenspace @xmath87 where the eigenfunctions satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath88 and hence look like @xmath89 one can now see how the `` field equation operators '' look in the d dimensional space - time @xmath7 from their action on @xmath87 : @xmath90 where @xmath19 thus obtained is the corresponding `` field equation operator '' in the d dimensional @xmath7 . similarly we can get @xmath91 from @xmath92 .",
    "we now proceed to obtain them explicitly .",
    "@xmath93 let us evaluate @xmath94 first .",
    "@xmath95 ( substituting @xmath96 from ( 17 ) ) @xmath97 ( since @xmath98+{\\hat{\\nabla}}_am_r{}^{a}=d{\\hat{\\nabla}}_r+{\\hat{\\nabla}}_am_r{}^{a}$ ] ) @xmath99 next we evaluate @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 thus we finally have @xmath102 where we have used @xmath103 , the usual relation between the first and second quantized operators . using the definition of @xmath17 we get @xmath104 next",
    "let us look at @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 now @xmath107 @xmath108 then @xmath109 we are still left with @xmath110 . @xmath111",
    "now @xmath112 thus @xmath113 the complete set of field equations @xmath114 are then given by ( 30),(31 ) and ( 32 ) .",
    "we should mention that although field equations for most massless gauge fields were known for both bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite , this simple derivation is completely new and we believe that the field equations for the field strength is new , too . +",
    "* ds vs. ads and unitarity : * we obtained the field equations ( 30)-(32 ) by dimensional reduction of an extra space - like or time - like coordinate corresponding to ds or ads respectively .",
    "it is well known that even in ordinary dimensional reduction of a time - like coordinate we run into tachyons , which render the theory nonunitary . as expected therefore ,",
    "in the case of ads when we are reducing the time - like radial coordinate , we encounter tachyons .",
    "this is clearer when one tries to obtain the ads action by the dimensional reduction prescription .",
    "we can however circumvent this problem by performing a wick rotation in the `` @xmath115 '' coordinate , which implies for example that instead of using @xmath116 modes we should use @xmath117 ( see section 3 for details ) . for field equations , this essentially means that for ads we have to replace @xmath118 by @xmath119 , but the effect of wick rotation is more subtle when we deal with actions as we will explain in more detail in the next section .",
    "thus the field equations for ads look like @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122    for ds the field equations are given by ( 33)-(35 ) and all we have to do is to substitute @xmath123 . + * light - cone generators for bosons in ads : * light - cone form of generators is useful for various reasons .",
    "firstly , knowing its form one can apply brst techniques to obtain the action for the spin gauge fields .",
    "this was done successfully for example to derive the flat space - time gauge invariant action @xcite . secondly , even though we have obtained the field equations it is only for the gauge invariant field strengths .",
    "however we are usually interested in the physical ( gauge ) fields . in the light - cone formalism one",
    "eliminates the extra degrees of freedom and deals only with the physical fields .",
    "for example , the light - cone form of the symmetry generators gives us a representation in terms of only the physical fields .",
    "such an approach might prove especially useful if a consistent covariant formalism is absent ( a notable example being the superstring ) .",
    "finally and most importantly for us , the light - cone form of generators for arbitrary bosonic spin representations has already been worked out for ads @xcite purely from algebraic considerations .",
    "we therefore work out the bosonic case for ads which provides us with a non - trivial check of our results and approach in general .    to describe bosons we can choose @xmath124 which implies @xmath125 and simplifies the field equations .",
    "thus in ads we get after minor manipulations and recombinations @xmath126 where @xmath127 @xmath128 and @xmath129    there are various ways to obtain the light - cone generators",
    ". our approach will be to first impose constraints on the hilbert space , which removes extra degrees of freedom ( gauge degrees ) .",
    "then we solve the field equations ( at the level of operators ) which then effectively reduces the big hilbert space ( of field strengths ) to the hilbert space of physical states involving only gauge ( physical ) fields .",
    "to apply this procedure however we have to work in a specific coordinate system .",
    "we choose the coordinate system where the ads vielbein and its inverse looks like @xmath130 where @xmath131 and the coordinates are given by @xmath132 , @xmath133 with @xmath134 . in this frame",
    "one can compute the field equations ( see appendix for details ) which after some re - organization and appropriate scalings ( by factors of @xmath135 ) are given by @xmath136 @xmath137\\ ] ] @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are operators given entirely in terms of the spin operators @xmath141 : @xmath142 where we have introduced the operators @xmath143 as linear combinations of the spin operators : @xmath144    we now go into the light - cone frame where the flat indices further break up into @xmath145 the usual way ; @xmath146 now represent the transverse directions , @xmath147 .",
    "this essentially involves the coordinate transformation @xmath148 and the metric now is given by @xmath149 to obtain the physical space we impose the following operator constraints ( gauge conditions ) @xmath150 this only changes the operators @xmath139 and @xmath140 so that now they contain only the transverse spin operators , effectively reducing the dimension by 2 .",
    "@xmath151 @xmath152{\\rightarrow}[s_{iz},a]\\ ] ] where the inner products are now with respect to only the transverse directions .",
    "we can now solve the field equations ( 41)-(43 ) which yields @xmath153 @xmath154+s^{ij}p_j+s^{iz}p_z)\\ ] ] @xmath155 substituting these `` constraints '' in the symmetry generators one can now obtain their light - cone representation . here",
    "we present the lorentz generators : @xmath156}+s^{ij}\\ ] ] @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159+\\frac{1}{p^+}(s^{ij}p_j+s^{iz}p_z)\\ ] ]    these results coincide exactly with the known results @xcite and one can verify this for all other conformal generators in a similar way .",
    "* compactification and wick rotation : * we have so far successfully dimensionally reduced the symmetry generators and field equations from d+1 dimensional flat space - time to d dimensional ds / ads space - time .",
    "we next venture to do the same for the actions .",
    "it should perhaps be mentioned that we could have also followed the prescription of obtaining the action from the light - cone form of the lorentz generators in ds / ads space - time just as it was done for flat space - time @xcite using brst techniques . however , this would firstly be more cumbersome and secondly give us an answer only in a special ( light - cone ) coordinate system , which we have to then covariantize .",
    "it is simpler and more elegant to obtain the ds / ads actions by performing the radial dimensional reduction of the action directly , which will also demonstrate the general applicability of the method .",
    "as we mentioned in the earlier sections , we will obtain the ds / ads gauge invariant actions by compactifying the `` @xmath115 '' coordinate .",
    "we thus start with the known gauge invariant d+1 dimensional flat space - time action , which is typically of the form @xmath160 where @xmath161 is an operator ( quadratic in derivatives for bosons , and linear for fermions ) .",
    "this action is invariant under the ( infinitesimal ) lorentz transformations @xmath162 which after compactification translates to invariance under the isometry group of ds / ads : @xmath163 the flat action ( 54 ) will also in general possess some gauge invariance which is preserved after compactification , the mode gauge transformation laws following from the harmonic expansion of the original gauge field .",
    "it is convenient to view the compactification scheme in two steps .",
    "first we perform a weyl transformation ( 19 )",
    ". then the action looks like @xmath164 where @xmath165 . for a bosonic action , as we shall see later @xmath166 while for the fermions @xmath167 .",
    "further we know that for bosons @xmath168 while for fermions @xmath169 and thus in both cases we have @xmath170 now we can apply the usual kaluza - klein compactification procedure : @xmath171 since at least for the bosons we have the flat space - time action in terms of real gauge fields , it is perhaps useful to expand the gauge fields in terms of sines and cosines ( one can of course also use exponential modes ) : @xmath172\\ ] ] if one substitutes ( 59 ) in ( 57 ) one finds that after the @xmath115 integration the different `` @xmath119-modes '' separate , which is essentially guaranteed by scale invariance of the original action ( 54 ) .",
    "the decoupling of the sine and the cosine modes is trickier and we will discuss that in the next section , but for now we turn to a more important matter , that of unitarity .    for ds the above",
    "prescription goes through without any complications and after compactification we obtain a gauge invariant ds action for each separate mode which differ from each other in their `` mass parameter '' @xmath119 .",
    "however , as we anticipated before , compactification of @xmath115 which is time - like in ads leads to problems with unitarity although we do obtain gauge invariant actions . to solve this problem we invoke wick rotation ( before performing the compactification )",
    "so that @xmath115 becomes imaginary : @xmath173 the wick rotation has two implications in the subsequent compactification procedure .",
    "first , since the gauge fields are now periodic in @xmath174 , in terms of @xmath115 the mode expansion becomes @xmath175\\ ] ] this explains for example , why we needed to use the modes @xmath117 instead of @xmath116 for ads to derive the field equations ( 41)-(43 ) .",
    "second , since @xmath176 , integration of @xmath174 from 0 to @xmath177 is a contour integral in @xmath5 around 0 in the complex r - plane .",
    "it is then easy to check that for both ds and ads we have ( writing everything in terms of @xmath5 to avoid confusion ) @xmath178\\ ] ] where @xmath179 and @xmath180 are the harmonic modes which satisfy the orthogonality condition @xmath181 where for ads the @xmath5-integral is a contour integral while for ds it is the usual line integral .",
    "we have omitted the precise normalizations because as noted before the overall coefficients in front of the reduced mode actions are unimportant . for later convenience",
    "we note @xmath182 + * bosonic actions : * we start with the flat space - time bosonic action that one obtains through @xmath183 formalism @xcite using brst techniques . in this method one",
    "first adds 4 extra coordinates , two bosonic ( one space like and one time - like ) and two fermionic , to the d+1 flat space - time coordinates .",
    "then one performs a light - cone reduction which eliminates the two light - cone coordinates ( from the d+3 bosonic dimensions ) so that we are still left with a d+1 dimensional bosonic space ( which is now treated as the space - time manifold ) and two fermionic dimensions .",
    "the gauge fields are a representation of this @xmath184 dimensional space - time . in this formalism",

    "second , we can obtain the critical values for the masslessness / partial masslessness conditions . from the gauge transformations ( 102 )",

    "@xmath319 one immediately recognises the dirac lagrangian : @xmath320\\ ] ] where @xmath321 .",
    "there is however a small subtelty when d is odd . since the dirac spinor in d+1 dimensions has twice the components as the dirac spinor in d dimensions ( for odd d ) the dirac lagrangian that we obtain through dimensional reduction is reducible ( the same is true for ordinary dimensional reduction ) .",
    "however , it is easy to see that this reducible spinor decomposes into two d - dimensional dirac spinors .",
    "for example , one can start with a representation of the d+1 dimensional gamma matrices such that the @xmath322 s are block diagonal .",
    "another strategy to deal with odd dimensions could be to start with weyl spinors in d+1 dimensions , which has the same number of components as the d - dimensional dirac spinor and would presumably reduce to it .    for ads ,",
    "the gamma matrices satisfy @xmath323 where as before @xmath313 .",
    "now expanding the action in the harmonic modes and keeping only the terms for a single @xmath119 we have @xmath324\\ ] ] we should remember however that the `` bar '' contains an extra factor of @xmath304 and hence converting them to normal `` bar '' we obtain @xmath325\\ ] ] note that @xmath304 is still anti - hermitian ( 114 ) and we can choose @xmath316 as in ds we could also have chosen the opposite configuration .",

    "if we define @xmath330 we obtain the `` right '' gamma matrices and the lagrangian is then given by @xmath331\\ ] ] again we recognise the dirac lagrangian , aside from the subtelty for odd dimensions which can be taken care of in exactly the same way as in ds .",
    "so far we have been discussing radial dimensional reduction of free theories .",
    "however , the success of the method is tempting for us to try and generalise this procedure to interacting theories .    to relate the radial reduction to the usual kaluza - klein reduction it is convenient to work in terms of the weyl transformed fields ( 19 ) and introduce the coordinate @xmath332 as we did for the flat case , with @xmath333 as @xmath334 .",
    "kaluza - klein reduction now amounts to making the @xmath115 coordinate periodic : @xmath335 the various fields can now be expressed as a harmonic expansion in the @xmath115 coordinate .",
    "for example for a general matter field we have @xmath336 which in terms of the @xmath5 coordinate implies @xmath337 where @xmath338 the radial dimensional reduction that we discussed in the earlier section clearly corresponds to choosing a particular harmonic ( @xmath339 ) .",
    "it is clear that just as we required that the d+1 dimensional flat space - time free theories to be scale invariant ( we only considered massless theories ) for the dimensional reduction to work , we will now need the interacting theories to be scale invariant for the same reasons .",
    "further , since we are now dealing with an interacting theory , we have to use a @xmath340 symmetry generator @xcite , say @xmath341 , to select the eigenmodes corresponding to the different fields of the interacting theory , which will combine to form the d dimensional multiplet . in the conventional dimensional reduction scheme",
    "this is acheived by modifying the eigenvalue equation @xmath342 that was used for free theories to @xmath343 . for the radial reduction it works almost the same way , except that we have to replace @xmath230 by @xmath33 just as we did for free threories ( 1 ) .",
    "@xmath344 this ensures that the `` mass phases '' coming from the eigenfunctions of the different fields cancel in each of the terms in the action , provided @xmath341 is a symmetry of the original action .",
    "in this paper we have successfully obtained first the field equations ( for field strengths ) and then the action for the most general spin representations in ds / ads of arbitrary space - time dimension .",
    "the success relied essentially on two key ingredients .",
    "first , the geometric picture of viewing ds / ads as a `` sphere '' in one higher dimensional flat space - time of appropriate signature .",
    "this introduced the concept of `` radial dimensional reduction '' , which differs from ordinary dimensional reduction by the fact that we end up with the `` sphere '' instead of a flat manifold .",
    "second , was the ingredient of scale invariance which the flat space - time field equations and actions possessed .",
    "this helped us to get the algebra of the symmetry generators and field equations right and in case of actions guaranteed the decoupling of the different `` m modes '' .",
    "this approach not only gives us the general results but also provides us with a general algorithm to link between the flat and ds / ads space - time physics , which now hopefully will find many other applications .",
    "we discussed how the radial reduction of `` free theories '' ( the action being quadratic in the fields ) can be generalized to include interactions .",
    "another important generalization could be to consider radial dimensional reduction of an arbitrary manifold , essentially a supergravity theory .",
    "however , only future research will be able to tell for example , whether radial reduction of supergravity in 11 dimensions give a different ( from the one that is obtained by ordinary dimensional reduction ) consistent supergravity in 10 dimensions .",
    "it is clear that for both these scenarios to work there has to be a @xmath340 symmetry in the action which will be needed to preserve scale invariance ( the imaginary mass parameters canceling against each other in every term in the action ) .",
    "this however may not be sufficient to guarantee the success of the reduction and of course one has to study these theories carefully ( which we plan to do in future ) .",
    "one can think of other possible generalisations in the reduction scheme .",
    "for example , to apply similar techniques to obtain actions for non - maximally isometric spaces , or for that matter to reduce more than one dimension simultaneously . the problem with these",
    "are that we do not have any symmetry like scale invariance which was so crucial for the success of this reduction . without further speculations it might just be fair to say that this algorithm that we have developed shows promise for future generalizations and applications .    with regard to the specific problem we considered , even though we succeeded in our goal of obtaining the most general action for ds / ads some work still needs to be done to understand the ds / ads multiplets better .",
    "firstly , it will be nice to have a well - defined technique to obtain real multiplets from the complex multiplets for which we obtained the actions .",
    "such a prescription exists for the usual reduction @xcite , so we hope an analogue will exist for radial reduction too . secondly , and perhaps most importantly , we should try to understand the phenomenon of masslessness or partial masslessness in this framework",
    ". a related question will be to predict which are the spin fields that one can not dissociate from the highest spin - field in a spin multiplet even when mass is zero @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we know that the issue of unitarity is tricky in ads and especially in ds . previous research @xcite has shown that there are regions in coupling parameters ( @xmath119 in our case ) where unitarity is violated .",
    "we do not yet know whether there is a geometric way to explain these regions .",
    "finally it might be a good idea to obtain the various results that are already known for ds / ads using this formalism which will also serve as a rigorous test for it .",
    "thus as it stands there are a lot of open questions and possibilities that this work has provided us , hopefully future research will shed light upon them .",
    "we start with the field equations ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) equation is redundant because of linear dependence of the field equations . ] . to compute them explicitly in the given reference frame we need to evaluate the covariant derivatives given by ( 13 ) . as in section 2",
    "we use weyl transformations ( 14 ) . here",
    "we have @xmath345 then `` prime '' covariant derivatives are just the partial derivatives , the `` prime '' vielbein being flat . thus the covariant derivatives are given by @xmath346 using ( 127 ) one can compute the field equations : @xmath347 @xmath348 it turns out that to compare with the known results we have to transform these field equation operators : @xmath349 after performing the rescaling the field equations look like @xmath350 @xmath351 and @xmath352 after combining some equations and a little bit of algebra one can cast the equations into the following form : @xmath353 @xmath354 and @xmath355 where @xmath356 @xmath357 and @xmath358\\ ] ] one can re - express @xmath139 and @xmath140 in terms of operators @xmath143 as defined in ( 45 ) and after some tedious manipulations one gets ( 44 ) .",
