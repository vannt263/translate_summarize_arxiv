    "power - law  like x - ray spectra extending up to soft @xmath2-rays ( hereafter x@xmath2 ) are a common feature of the emission from accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and black - hole binaries ( bhbs ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that those spectra are produced by the comptonization process taking place in optically thin accreting plasmas with typical electron energies of @xmath3 kev .",
    "similar spectra are also observed from weakly - magnetized accreting neutron stars ( e.g.  barret et al .",
    "2000 ) , where they can originate either in the accretion flow or in a boundary layer near the neutron star surface .",
    "the x@xmath2 spectra of seyfert 1s and x - ray binaries in their hard ( low ) states can be modelled by comptonization on thermal electrons , see e.g.zdziarski ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , both observations and theoretical considerations suggest that a small non - thermal component may be present in the electron distribution , giving rise to a weak non - thermal high - energy tail in the observed comptonization spectrum .",
    "such a tail above @xmath4 mev has been detected in the spectrum of cyg x-1 in the hard state by the comptel detector aboard _",
    "( mcconnell et al .  1994 , 2000a ) . in other bhbs and in seyferts ,",
    "the existing upper limits are compatible with the presence of weak non - thermal tails ( e.g.  zdziarski et al .",
    "1998 ; gondek et al . 1996",
    "; johnson et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a non - thermal tail in the electron distribution in compact x@xmath2 sources can arise due to many different physical mechanisms .",
    "one such mechanism is acceleration in the process of dissipation of magnetic field ( similarly to the case of the solar corona ) in an optically - thin accretion flow or in active coronal regions above an optically thick disc .",
    "then , the energy loss and subsequent thermalization of the accelerated electrons leads to a steady - state electron distribution consisting of a maxwellian and a non - thermal tail . apart from coulomb interactions ,",
    "an effective thermalizing process is synchrotron self - absorption ( ghisellini , guilbert & svensson 1988 ) .    a strong support for the occurrence of non - thermal processes in black - hole accretion flows comes from observations of x@xmath2 spectra of black - hole binaries in the soft state .",
    "in that case , compton scattering by non - thermal electrons appears to be the dominant process ( poutanen & coppi 1998 ; gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the well - studied case of cyg x-1 ,",
    "the power - law  like spectrum from this process becomes dominant at @xmath5 kev ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) and it extends to at least @xmath6 mev ( mcconnell et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "an important issue concerns the source of soft photons undergoing comptonization in the accreting plasma .",
    "a natural candidate is thermal emission from an optically thick accretion disc , either below the corona or outside the region of optically thin accretion flow .",
    "however , as the presence of magnetic fields of the order of that corresponding to equipartition with gas pressure ( i.e. @xmath0 g in agns and @xmath7 g in bhbs ) is expected , one has to take into account comptonization of synchrotron photons ( hereafter the cs process ) when calculating the emergent spectra . in models of advection - dominated accretion flows",
    ", the cs process may be the main radiative process in the innermost part of the accretion flow , where most of the available gravitational energy is liberated ( e.g.  narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "wardziski & zdziarski ( 2000 , hereafter wz00 ) have investigated the efficiency of the thermal cs process under physical conditions relevant for accreting black holes and found that it can dominate only in low - luminosity agns and in luminous stellar x - ray sources with the hardest spectra . in the latter case , however , the presence of a correlation between the spectral index and the strength of x - ray reflection ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ; gilfanov , revnivtsev & churazov 1999 ; lubiski & zdziarski 2001 ) appears to imply that blackbody emission of cold media is the main source of seed photons for thermal comptonization , and the cs process is negligible .    in this work , we extend our previous results to the case of a hybrid , quasi - thermal plasma and investigate the influence of a weak non - thermal component in the electron distribution on the efficiency of the cs process . in section [ s : distributions ] , we discuss the shape of the electron distribution function resulting from acceleration processes operating in accretion flows .",
    "the influence of non - thermal tails on the cs emission of the plasma is discussed in section [ s : emission ] .",
    "we then investigate in detail synchrotron emission and comptonization spectrum of hybrid electrons in sections [ s : synchrotron ] and [ s : comptonization ] , respectively .",
    "this allows us to estimate the efficiency of the cs process in hybrid plasmas ( section [ s : cs ] ) , and those results are applied to astrophysical black - hole sources in section [ s : applications ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ s : discussion ] .",
    "in accretion flows , hybrid electron distributions can be produced e.g.by stochastic acceleration of thermal electrons by interaction with plasma instabilities , e.g.  with whistlers via gyroresonance ( as applied to the case of cyg x-1 by li , kusunose & liang 1996 ) or with fast - mode alfvn waves via transit - time damping ( li & miller 1997 ) .",
    "such process can result from dissipation of magnetic field in an accretion disc corona ( where magnetic fields are raised from the disc by buoyant forces , galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ; haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) or in an optically thin accretion flow ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 1997 ) , provided a significant fraction of the released energy generates turbulence .",
    "li & miller ( 1997 ) considered parameters typical for a plasma in an accretion disc corona around a stellar black hole .",
    "they have shown , by solving the fokker - planck equation , that electrons can be effectively accelerated from the thermal background to relativistic energies , so that in the stationary state a non - thermal tail of a power - law  like shape develops above certain lorentz gamma factor @xmath8 ( which value is determined by the efficiency of thermalization processes , see section [ s : emission ] , ) and the power - law index , @xmath9 , depends strongly on the plasma optical depth .",
    "the power - law component is cut off at a @xmath10 due to radiative losses overcoming acceleration .",
    "dermer , miller & li ( 1996 ) predict somewhat larger cut - off energies in the case of electron acceleration by whistlers and in a plasma with parameters relevant for agns .",
    "similar shape of steady - state electron distribution is also predicted from thermalization by synchrotron self - absorption and coulomb interaction of an injected power - law electron distribution ( produced by any acceleration mechanism ) , as shown by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .",
    "the exact shape of the non - thermal tail depends strongly on the plasma parameters and the ( uncertain ) mechanism of magnetic field dissipation and electron acceleration . we shall therefore consider a generic electron distribution function of the form qualitatively reproducing that predicted by detailed modelling of electron acceleration , @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the dimensionless electron temperature and @xmath13 is the relativistic maxwellian normalized by the relation , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the _ total _ electron density .",
    "this hybrid electron distribution consists thus of a thermal part below @xmath16 and an e - folded power - law above it ( see also section [ s : discussion ] ) .",
    "we note that the cases @xmath17 and @xmath18 are qualitatively different . in the former ,",
    "most of the non - thermal synchrotron luminosity is produced by electrons with @xmath19 and the non - thermal synchrotron spectrum is hard . in the latter case , the luminosity is produced mostly by low - energy electrons , @xmath20 , and the spectrum is soft .",
    "observations of cyg x-1 ( gierliski et al .  1999 ; mcconnell et al .",
    "2000a ) suggest @xmath18 . in the following we assume @xmath21 .",
    "the degree to which a hybrid distribution is non - thermal can be measured by the quantity , @xmath22 , which shows how far in the maxwellian tail the non - thermal power law starts .",
    "another such quantity is the ratio of the energy densities in the non - thermal and thermal parts of the electron distribution , @xmath23 , which , for mildly relativistic temperatures and @xmath24 can be approximated as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a modified bessel function and we employed an approximation for the thermal energy density from gammie & popham ( 1998 ) . in the above derivation ( as well as in all analytical approximations below ) we neglected , for simplicity , the exponential cut - off in the distribution ( [ e : distribution ] ) .",
    "typical relations between @xmath23 and @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : delta ] .",
    "since the exponential term in equation ( [ e : eratio ] ) varies fastest , we have an approximate dependence , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is slowly increasing with increasing @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we then see that @xmath22 only weakly depends on @xmath30 and the shape of the tail for a given @xmath23 , see fig.[f : delta ] .",
    "in accreting black holes , synchrotron emission from thermal plasmas optically thin to scattering is usually strongly self - absorbed up to a turnover frequency , @xmath32 , below which the plasma is optically thick to absorption , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the absorption coefficient and @xmath35 is the characteristic size of the source .",
    "hereafter , we assume that @xmath32 is determined only by synchrotron absorption , i.e. other radiative processes are negligible at @xmath36 .",
    "typically , accretion flow models predict ( assuming equipartition magnetic fields ) @xmath37 hz for bhbs and @xmath38 hz for agns , see e.g. wz00 .",
    "this corresponds to the value of @xmath39 from tens to hundreds , where @xmath40 is the cyclotron frequency for the magnetic field of the strength @xmath41 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the rest mass of the electron and the velocity of light . the ratio , @xmath44 , is larger in agns as a result of their magnetic field weaker than that in bhbs .",
    "the lorentz factor , @xmath45 , of the electrons that emit most of their synchrotron radiation at @xmath32 is of the order of @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is of the order of a few , again larger in the case of agns than of bhbs .",
    "first , let us consider a homogenous cloud of thermal plasma .",
    "the cs spectrum below the thermal turnover frequency , @xmath47 , can be approximated as a rayleigh - jeans spectrum . above @xmath47 ,",
    "the synchrotron emission drops rapidly and the spectrum is often dominated by a power - law component resulting from comptonization , which is cut off above an energy of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the electron temperature and @xmath50 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "= 6.8 cm    = 6.8 cm    now , let us assume that the electron distribution is given by equation ( [ e : distribution ] ) . if @xmath51 , the number of electrons with @xmath52 will increase ( compared to the thermal case ) as well as the absorption coefficient and in consequence the new turnover frequency , @xmath53 , will be larger .",
    "also the shape of the synchrotron spectrum is modified in this case . at low frequencies",
    "both emission and absorption are dominated by thermal electrons so that the optically thick spectrum is still the rayleigh - jeans one . however , at higher frequencies the emission of non - thermal electrons starts to dominate , while absorption is still dominated by thermal electrons [ which is a consequence of the thermal distribution falling off much more steeply than the non - thermal one , see equation ( [ e : alpha ] ) ] , and the optically - thick spectrum quickly increases .",
    "this leads to the regime in which both the non - thermal emission and absorption dominate , in which case the spectrum is proportional to the source function of non - thermal electrons .",
    "finally , the spectrum becomes optically thin ( @xmath54 ) , turning over above @xmath53 .",
    "this behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : widma ] where the resulting synchrotron spectra are calculated for two different energy contents of the non - thermal tail and , as a reference , for the purely thermal case .",
    "note that the non - thermal tail has to be sufficiently strong for the optically thick spectrum to reach the non - thermal source function before it turns over .",
    "both optically thick and optically thin parts of the synchrotron spectrum will undergo comptonization .",
    "this process will thus be modified with respect to the thermal case due to two effects .",
    "firstly , compton scattering itself will involve both thermal electrons as well as non - thermal ones .",
    "the effect of non - thermal electrons on comptonization will be most prominent at energies @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the planck constant ) , where a high - energy tail ( above the thermal cut - off ) will develop .",
    "secondly , the seed - photon flux will be higher , so luminosity in the thermal comptonization spectrum will also increase . since @xmath45 in optically - thin plasmas around black holes is expected to be well above the mean energy of the thermal electrons , even a non - thermal tail carrying a tiny fraction of the total electron energy , and thus only weakly modifying the shape of the comptonization spectrum , can increase the turnover frequency and thus the luminosity produced by the cs process by a large factor .",
    "then a question arises whether the presence of strong synchrotron self - absorption , acting as a thermalizing mechanism for electrons of @xmath57 ( i.e. in the regime of optically thick emission ) , will allow for an electron distribution deviating substantially from a pure maxwellian for @xmath52 .",
    "this issue was addressed by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , who have shown that an initial power - law distribution of injected electrons will develop ( after the thermalization time scale equal to a few synchrotron cooling timescales , @xmath58 , defined for the mean energy of the electrons radiating in the optically thick range of the spectrum ) into a maxwellian stationary distribution for @xmath59 , provided the synchrotron cooling dominates and @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the escape time from the source ) . assuming equipartition of magnetic field pressure with gas pressure",
    ", we find the latter criterion is always fulfilled in accretion flows onto black holes , independent of the form of the injected distribution .",
    "however , when the inverse compton process is dominant as a cooling mechanism , both @xmath16 and @xmath62 diminish and a power - law tail starting below @xmath45 is formed , see ghisellini & svensson ( 1990 ) . a sufficient condition for the dominance of compton cooling is @xmath63 , which is typically fulfilled in astrophysical accreting black holes . even when @xmath64 , comptonization of external soft photons ( e.g.  from a cold accretion disk ) can dominate electron cooling ( see , e.g.  ghisellini et al.1998 )",
    "thus , @xmath65 is a likely condition in those sources .",
    "let @xmath66 be the synchrotron emission coefficient of a single electron averaged both over the electron velocity direction and the direction of emission . then",
    ", the absorption coefficient for an isotropic distribution of electrons in a chaotic magnetic field is ( e.g.  ghisellini & svensson 1991 ) is @xmath67 { \\rm d } \\gamma.\\ ] ]    we assume a homogenous spherical source of the radius , @xmath35 , and the thomson optical depth , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the thomson cross section .",
    "then , we can numerically calculate the absorption coefficient with equation ( [ e : alpha ] ) for the distribution of equation ( [ e : distribution ] ) and then solve equation ( [ e : turnover ] ) for the turnover frequency , @xmath53 .",
    "this can be compared with the _ thermal _ turnover frequency , which for plasma parameters typical for accreting black holes can be approximated as ( wz00 ) @xmath71    on the other hand , we can obtain an analytical estimate , @xmath72 , of the turnover frequency for the hybrid electron distribution by considering a purely power - law electron distribution normalized to match the maxwellian at @xmath16 . for the synchrotron absorption coefficient for power - law electrons ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , @xmath73^{\\frac{2}{4+p}},\\ ] ] which , with equation ( [ e : eratio ] )",
    ", leads to @xmath74 where @xmath75 @xmath76 is the classical electron radius and @xmath77 is euler s gamma function .",
    "provided @xmath78 ( so that radiation from electrons with @xmath79 is negligible ) and emission at @xmath53 is dominated by non - thermal electrons ( i.e. @xmath80 , which condition can be checked a posteriori by comparing the source function of power - law electrons to the rayleigh - jeans intensity ) , @xmath81 . on the other hand , @xmath82 when emission from thermal electrons is significant at @xmath53 and , in general , @xmath83 the accuracy of this approximation is",
    "typically @xmath84 per cent ( provided @xmath85 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "see wz00 for a discussion of approximations of @xmath47 .",
    "we can obtain the dependences of @xmath86 on the plasma parameters by considering the ratio @xmath87 [ given by approximations ( [ e : nuthapp ] ) and ( [ e : nupl ] ) ] .",
    "first , at constant @xmath23 , this ratio decreases with increasing @xmath30 since then @xmath16 increases with @xmath30 [ see equation ( [ e : handwaving ] ) ] .",
    "the dependence on @xmath68 is stronger for @xmath88 than for @xmath47 as a result of much steeper optically thin synchrotron spectrum in the latter case .",
    "this leads to @xmath89 , i.e. the larger the optical depth , the larger the ratio @xmath87 . in a hot accretion flow",
    ", we generally expect @xmath68 increasing and @xmath30 decreasing with increasing accretion rate , so the effect of a non - thermal tail ( of a given form ) on the value of the turnover frequency can be expected to be the largest for the most luminous sources .    since @xmath90 , the non - thermal increase of the turnover frequency grows with decreasing @xmath91 .",
    "this effect is due to the increase of @xmath45 with decreasing @xmath91 [ as a result of increasing @xmath92 , see equation ( [ e : nuthapp ] ) ] , which leads to a much larger ratio of the number of non - thermal to thermal electrons at @xmath45 for a given @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the effect of a non - thermal tail with a given form will be much stronger in agns than in bhbs ( due to much weaker magnetic field in the former objects ) .",
    "= 6.7 cm    = 6.7 cm    = 6.7 cm    fig .",
    "[ f : ratio ] shows the values of @xmath93 as a function of @xmath22 for three sets of thermal plasma parameters . in the first and second set",

    "we assume parameters relevant to agns , @xmath68=1 , @xmath97 cm , @xmath98 g and @xmath96 .",
    "for each set , we consider two different slopes of the non - thermal tail , @xmath99 and 4 and @xmath100 .",
    "additionally , we consider the cases of @xmath101 and 100 for @xmath99 ( for @xmath18 the influence of the cut - off is much weaker ) .",
    "we see that even a weak non - thermal component , with @xmath102 ( which corresponds to only @xmath4 per cent of the total energy density of the electrons in the non - thermal tail ) can lead to an increase of the turnover frequency by a factor of @xmath1032 for bhbs and @xmath6 for agns .",
    "the dependence of the relative increase of the turnover frequency on @xmath9 and @xmath104 is relatively weak .",
    "this reflects the fact that the turnover frequency depends mostly on the number of electrons at @xmath45 and since for small values of @xmath23 , @xmath45 is only slightly larger than @xmath16 , @xmath105 depends weakly on either @xmath9 or @xmath104 .",
    "this suggests that the degree of the dependence on @xmath9 and @xmath104 should increase with increasing @xmath93 , in agreement with our results .",
    "it is important to note that weak dependence of @xmath93 on the shape of the non - thermal tail makes our results weakly dependent on details of the acceleration mechanism .",
    "for comptonization by a thermal plasma , we employ here a simple treatment of this process of zdziarski ( 1985 , 1986 ) . in that approximation , the comptonization spectrum above the frequency , @xmath106 , at which soft seed photons are injected ( which , in the case of the cs process , @xmath107 ) , can be approximated as a sum of an e - folded power - law with energy index @xmath108 and a wien spectrum , @xmath109{\\rm e}^{-x/\\theta},\\ ] ] where @xmath110 ( hereafter all indices of @xmath111 have the same meaning as those of @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 is the volume - averaged scattering probability . its integration yields the thermal - compton luminosity , which , in the case of a spherical source , is @xmath114,\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is a constant depending on the flux of the injected seed photons ( we calculate @xmath115 in section [ s : cs ] for the case of synchrotron seed photons ) .",
    "the presence of non - thermal electrons modifies the comptonization spectrum and since for the electron distributions we consider ( i.e. @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) the thomson optical depth for scattering off non - thermal electrons is @xmath118 , the resulting spectrum can be approximated as a convolution of the thermal comptonization spectrum with a spectrum resulting from single scattering of photons off non - thermal electrons .",
    "therefore , for @xmath119 , the comptonization spectrum becomes harder , while for @xmath120 , above the thermal cut - off , a power - law tail in the spectrum develops . as a result , the overall luminosity produced by comptonization increases .",

    "we assume that the photons undergoing scattering off non - thermal electrons are those from the thermal comptonization spectrum above @xmath126 .",
    "then @xmath127 where the factor @xmath128 accounts for the change of the escape time due to scatterings in the source and is a matching formula between the optically thin case ( where the escape time is @xmath129 ) and the optically thick one ( @xmath130 , sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) .",
    "we can further simplify the calculations assuming that the spectrum of photons undergoing non - thermal comptonization is a pure power - law and then neglect scatterings in the klein - nishina limit ( see below ) .",

    "an important feature measuring the deviation from purely thermal comptonization spectrum is the fraction of the luminosity radiated in the high - energy tail beyond the thermal spectrum .",
    "the ratio @xmath138 is larger than this fraction as it incorporates also the non - thermal luminosity at energies below the tail .",

    "amplifies the power produced by the cs process sufficiently to reproduce the luminosities of those sources .",
    "therefore , unlike the results obtained by wz00 from investigating the purely thermal cs process , in the case of electron distributions with relatively weak non - thermal tails the cs process appears to be capable of producing the observed x - ray spectra of accreting black holes , independent of the eddington ratio or the black hole mass .    on the other hand ,",
    "the estimated _ thermal _ cs luminosity in the case of cyg x-1 in the hot disc model is comparable to that observed from the source . then , we find that the non - thermal tail observed by mcconnell et al .",
    "( 2000a ) would produce the cs luminosity @xmath149 times higher than that actually observed ( see fig .",
    "[ f : widma]a , where thermal and hybrid synchrotron spectra are plotted for plasma parameters assumed in this model ) .",
    "the requirement that @xmath196 can not exceed the source luminosity constrains the magnetic field strength in the model to be @xmath197 g , which is @xmath198 times smaller than the equipartition value estimated by wz00 .",
    "a similar constraint for cyg x-1 can be obtained in a model of active coronal regions above the disc with magnetic field dissipation ( see wz00 for details of the corresponding model of cs emission ) .",
    "assuming @xmath199 active regions of radius @xmath200 cm and height @xmath201 cm , we obtain @xmath202 g , much less than the field strength predicted assuming dissipation of magnetic field at a fraction of the alfvn speed , @xmath203 g. though varying @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 would change the upper limit on the field strength as well as the value of @xmath207 , the relation between these quantities would remain similar .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism of dissipation of disc field in small active regions above the disc can not be responsible for the energy release in the corona .",
    "this stems from the fact that @xmath207 is the minimum field strength necessary for the magnetic field to dissipate enough energy so as to produce the observed luminosity .",
    "therefore , either the model of active regions above a cold disc is ruled out for the hard state of cyg x-1 or another mechanism of energy release must operate .",
    "we point out that if the cs process were to be negligible ( as suggested by observations , see section [ s : discussion ] ) , the magnetic field would have to be even weaker , which would strengthen our conclusion even more . on the other hand ,",
    "a weak magnetic field does not present analogous difficulties in the hot accretion disc model as the disc heating is directly by gravity .",
    "we then check how sensitive the above results are to details of the observed spectra of cyg x-1 .",
    "first , the spectral index of cyg x-1 varies , and the value @xmath189 assumed above is the hardest one and spectra with @xmath208 have been also observed .",
    "second , the relative normalization between the comptel and osse spectra remains relatively uncertain , and it may be possible that the former is less by @xmath209 ( mcconnell et al .",
    "2000b ) than the one used in the calculations above .",
    "this would then diminish the energy content in the electron non - thermal tail twice , which corresponds to the new value of @xmath210 .",
    "thus , we have repeated our calculations for @xmath208 and @xmath211 .",
    "the resulting constraints on the magnetic field strength in the hot disc and active regions models are then @xmath212 g and @xmath213 g , respectively .",
    "these values are only about twice the previous upper limits , which does not affect our conclusions above .",
    "we note that another constraint on the cs emission may be provided by extrapolating the x - ray power law spectrum to lower energies ( but @xmath214 ) , e.g.  to the uv or optical ranges . that emission should not , in any case , exceed that observed . in the case of cyg x-1 , we have extrapolated the observed x - ray power - law spectrum of cyg x-1 ( gierliski et al .",

    "iue _ ( treves et al .",
    "thus , those data are compatible with the cs origin of the x - ray spectrum in cyg x-1 .",

    "1998 ) . then",
    ", simultaneous ( as the object is highly variable , e.g.  corbet et al .  1987 ) observations in x - rays and at longer wavelengths can put constraints on the cs model in this case ( e.g.  fabian et al .",
    "we have studied the influence of non - thermal tails in the electron distribution on the comptonized synchrotron emission from plasmas of parameters typical for accreting black holes . in those plasmas ,",
    "most of the self - absorbed thermal synchrotron emission is produced by electrons far in the tail of the maxwellian distribution . as a result ,",
    "even a weak non - thermal component far beyond the thermal peak can greatly enhance the synchrotron emission .",
    "this emission provides seed photons for comptonization , which is also correspondingly enhanced .",
    "however , the shape the comptonization spectrum remains only weakly modified , with the main signature being a relatively weak high - energy tail .",
    "we have shown that this effect becomes stronger with the decreasing plasma temperature and increasing optical depth , which typically correspond to an increasing eddington ratio .",
    "it is also much stronger in the case of agns than of accreting stellar black holes , as a result of weaker magnetic field in the former objects .",
    "the cs luminosity can be amplified by a factor @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively , in the case of only @xmath4 per cent of the electron energy in the non - thermal tail .",
    "then , the comptonized synchrotron emission becomes energetically capable of producing the observed luminosities of accreting black holes independently of their eddington ratio or the black - hole mass .",
    "this conclusion is qualitatively different from that obtained in the case of purely thermal plasma .",
    "it is then possible to obtain upper limits on the magnetic field strength in optically thin plasmas around black holes by constraining the parameters of the non - thermal component in the electron distribution from observations of the high - energy tail in comptonization spectra .",
    "based on the _ cgro _ data for cyg x-1 in the hard state , we have obtained the upper limits on the field strength at least an order of magnitude below both the value corresponding to equipartition ( in the model of a two - temperature accretion disc ) and the minimum value required by dissipation of magnetic fields ( in the model of active coronal regions ) .",
    "therefore , the latter model appears to be ruled out for the hard state of cyg x-1 .",
    "we note that the presence of a strong correlation between reflection strength and the x - ray spectral index , observed in cyg x-1 ( gilfanov et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggests that the cs emission is a negligible source of photons for comptonization and thus the magnetic field strength must remain significantly below the upper limits derived above . the same correlation seen in other objects ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ; gilfanov et al .",
    "2000 ) implies that either the high - energy tails or the magnetic fields are weak enough for the cs process not to dominate the energy output .    in this work ,",
    "we have assumed , for the sake of simplicity and compatibility with studies of , e.g. , mcconnell et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , the electron distribution of the non - thermal electron tails to be @xmath216 at any value of @xmath2",
    ". however , when the power - law tail extends down to non - relativistic energies , @xmath217 , the distributions expected from acceleration processes are power laws in either the kinetic energy or the momentum , e.g.  @xmath218 for the former . clearly , the smaller @xmath16 ( i.e.  the larger @xmath23 ) , the larger the differences between those distributions .",
    "then , the actual shift of the turnover frequency at a given value of @xmath16 would be somehow smaller . also , the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath23 would change .",
    "nevertheless , the above effects would modify our results only quantitatively without affecting our conclusions .",
    "the influence of a weak , non - thermal , component in the electron distribution on radiation spectra has also been independently considered by zel , psaltis & narayan ( 2000 ) .",
    "their study has been devoted to the case of advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) , and their presented spectra are integrated over all radii of the flow .",
    "in contrast to our results , they do not note any shift in the turnover frequency at the peak of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "this appears to result from their study being constrained to the adaf model at low accretion rates , in which case electrons in the innermost parts of the accretion flow reach rather high temperatures ( at which even thermal electrons reach relatively high lorentz factors ) .",
    "those temperatures are significantly higher than those we consider based on observational data from luminous accreting black holes . on the other hand , zel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find a significant excess non - thermal emission at frequencies well below the peak of the integrated synchrotron spectrum .",
    "this excess results from radiation emitted at large radii , where the electron temperature is low , and where the synchrotron emission ( both optically thick and optically thin ) around the local turnover frequency can be strongly amplified by the presence of an electron tail , as illustrated in fig .",
