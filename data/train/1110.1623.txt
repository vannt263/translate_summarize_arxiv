    "extremal graph and hypergraph theory have in recent years seen a string of results obtained by application of the flag algebra calculus developed by razborov  @xcite . with the notable exception of the fano plane ,",
    "most known turn density results for 3-graphs have been obtained anew using his method , as well as some new results and the best known upper bounds for several other problems  @xcite . particularly impressive in this respect was razborov s proof of turn s conjecture under an additional restriction  @xcite : @xmath11    in this paper , we use the flag algebra calculus to prove several new turn density results . in section 3.1",
    "we develop the extremal theory of 3-graphs with independent neighbourhoods , proving : @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the 3-graph consisting of a vertex @xmath3 together with a disjoint set @xmath4 of size @xmath5 and all @xmath6 3-edges containing @xmath3 . in section 3.2 , we prove two density results where we forbid certain induced subgraphs : @xmath14 @xmath15 the latter result is an analogue for @xmath9 of the aforementioned theorem of razborov for @xmath16 .",
    "in addition we provide a number of new bounds , constructions and conjectures which may be of general interest .",
    "our main tool is flagmatic , an implementation of the flag algebra calculus , which was written by the second author , and which we are making publicly available .",
    "razborov s flag algebra calculus is an efficient formalism for computing density bounds in extremal combinatorics . in the case of extremal 3-graph theory",
    ", it does this by reducing an initial problem of proving inequalities for subgraph densities to a semi - definite programming problem , which in some cases can be solved exactly with the aid of a computer .",
    "we discuss what ` in some cases ' means in greater detail in section  4 .",
    "let us only say for the moment that without extra ideas we can not hope for a general extremal theory to emerge from a direct application of razborov s flag algebra calculus .",
    "however , given the difficulty of extremal 3-graph theory and the paucity of known results , an implementation of the flag algebra calculus such as flagmatic  can be of great help to theory - building efforts , by providing many useful bounds and guiding investigations towards attainable goals .",
    "a major hurdle for mathematicians wishing to use the flag algebra calculus in their work is the need of a computer program to assist them in the calculations .",
    "flagmatic  was designed with this in mind , and we have tried to make it as user - friendly as possible .",
    "as the flag algebra calculations involved in our proofs are very long and not terribly informative , we have produced ` certificates ' rather than write them out in full .",
    "the certificates are available on the flagmatic  website    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ http://maths.qmul.ac.uk/~ev/flagmatic _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    where the interested reader may also download a copy of flagmatic  for herself .",
    "in addition , our results have also been independently verified by baber and talbot  @xcite .",
    "we should stress that our proofs are computer assisted rather than computer generated ; indeed in every case we could produce ` proofs by hand ' by doing a lot of enumeration and computations , and then pulling some very large positive semi - definite matrices out of our hat .",
    "this would take thousands of pages however , and would not be very informative .",
    "we have therefore opted not to do so .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : after introducing a small amount of notation , section 2 is devoted to explaining how flagmatic  works , beginning with an exposition of the flag algebra calculus ( section 2.2 ) , some remarks about flagmatic  ( section 2.3 ) , and a discussion of the proof certificates it produces ( section 2.4 ) .",
    "section 3 contains our main results . in section 3.1",
    "we develop an extremal theory of 3-graphs with independent neighbourhoods , proving the first set of results mentioned in the introduction and providing several new constructions and conjectures ; in section 3.2 we consider forbidding induced subgraphs , obtaining in particular a theorem related to the conjecture of turn that @xmath17 ; in section 3.3 we go on to discuss ` non - principality ' ( the fact that @xmath18 for some families of 3-graphs @xmath19 ) .",
    "finally in section 4 we consider the limits inherent to our approach , in particular the ` complexity barrier ' it runs into .",
    "we end with some open questions and a summary of results and constructions .",
    "we begin with some notation and definitions , most of which are standard .",

    "@xmath20 is a pair of sets @xmath21 , with @xmath22 a set of vertices , and @xmath23 a collection of 3-sets from @xmath24 , which are the _",
    "3-edges _ of @xmath20 . given a family of 3-graphs @xmath25",
    ", we say that a 3-graph @xmath20 is _ @xmath25-free _ if @xmath20 contains no member of @xmath25 as a subgraph .",
    "we write @xmath26 for the maximal number of 3-edges that can be present in an @xmath25-free 3-graph . the nonnegative function @xmath26 is referred to as the _ turn number _ of @xmath25 .",
    "an easy averaging argument shows that @xmath27 is nonincreasing and hence tends to a limit as @xmath28 .",
    "this limit , denoted by @xmath29 , is the _ turn density _ of @xmath25 .",
    "it is the asymptotically maximal proportion of edges present in an @xmath25-free 3-graph .",
    "the standard _",
    "turn ( density ) problem _ for 3-graphs is : given a family @xmath25 , determine @xmath29 .",
    "the analogous question for 2-graphs has been completely answered by the erds - stone theorem ; by contrast very few turn densities of 3-graphs are known .",
    "( see the recent survey paper of keevash  @xcite for details . )",
    "we say that a particular instance of the turn problem for 3-graphs is _ stable _ if there is a sequence of 3-graphs @xmath30 such that for any @xmath31 there exists @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that any @xmath25-free 3-graph on @xmath34 vertices with more than @xmath35 3-edges can be transformed into @xmath36 by adding or deleting fewer than @xmath37 3-edges .",
    "( intuitively , this says there is an essentially unique extremal configuration , and that any ` close to extremal ' 3-graph must lie at a small ` edit ' distance from it . )",
    "let us now define various standard 3-graphs that appear in this paper .",
    "we shall write @xmath38 $ ] for @xmath39 , and when enumerating 3-edges , we shall often write @xmath40 for @xmath41 . when there is no confusion possible , we may also use ` edge ' for ` 3-edge ' , ` graph ' for ` 3-graph ' and ` subgraph ' for ` 3-subgraph ' .",
    "given a set @xmath4 and an integer @xmath42 , we shall write @xmath43 for the set of @xmath42-sets of @xmath4 .",
    "the _ complete _ 3-graph on @xmath5 vertices is the 3-graph @xmath44 , [ t]^{(3)})$ ] .",

    "various constructions we consider in this paper involve taking a ( possibly unbalanced ) partition of the vertex set @xmath54 and then adding edges according to some rule . in this",
    "setting , a 3-edge has type @xmath55 if it is of the form @xmath40 with @xmath56 .",
    "a _ blow - up _ construction is obtained by taking a @xmath57-graph @xmath58 on @xmath59 $ ] with some possibly degenerate edges  for example ` 112 ' or ` 333'and using it as a template to construct configurations for graphs of order @xmath60 for every @xmath61 as follows :    * partition @xmath38 $ ] into @xmath42 parts @xmath62 * add all edges of type @xmath63 with @xmath64    an _ iterated blow - up _ construction is obtained , as the name suggests , by taking a blow - up construction from a template @xmath58 and then repeating the construction inside ( some of ) the @xmath65 parts of the resulting 3-graph , and then again in the resulting subparts , and so on .",
    "the partition and edges obtained by the first iteration are said to be at _ level 1 _ of the construction , the subpartition and edges given by the second iteration are said to lie at _ level 2 _ , and so on .    finally and most importantly , given a 3-graph @xmath20 of order @xmath66 and a 3-graph @xmath58 of order @xmath67 ,",

    "self - contained , we shall give here a brief overview of the flag algebra calculus .",
    "as stated in the introduction , it consists of an efficient formalism introduced by razborov  @xcite for converting the problem of proving certain inequalities between subgraph densities into a semi - definite programming problem , which can be solved with the aid of a computer .",
    "excellent expositions of this calculus from an extremal combinatorics perspective have already appeared in the literature ; our presentation draws in particular on section 7 of  @xcite and section 2.1 of  @xcite .    for ease of notation and the sake of clarity",
    ", we shall consider 2-graphs rather than 3-graphs for our exposition , in contrast to  @xcite .",
    "razborov  @xcite in fact defined his flag algebra calculus in a much more general setting which includes 2-graphs and 3-graphs as special cases ; we feel that the 2-graph case gives all the intuition necessary , while keeping calculations to a minimum .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the complete 2-graph on 3 vertices , otherwise known as the triangle . to illustrate our discussion , we shall use the following weak form of mantel s theorem as a running example :    [ weak mantel ] @xmath73    what would be the crudest possible way of finding a nontrivial upper bound on @xmath74 ?",
    "we could observe that a triangle - free graph @xmath20 on @xmath60 vertices is at most as dense as the most dense subgraph of order @xmath67 that it contains .",
    "note that as @xmath20 is triangle - free , so are its subgraphs .",
    "say therefore that a subgraph is _ admissible _ if it is triangle - free and so could occur as a subgraph of @xmath20 . pick some integer @xmath75 , and",
    "let @xmath76 denote the collection of all _ admissible subgraphs _ of order @xmath75 up to isomorphism .",
    "we then have @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and thus @xmath79    this is fairly obviously a poor way to go about bounding @xmath74 .",
    "indeed pick for example @xmath80 .",
    "the family @xmath76 then consists of three graphs @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being the unique ( up to isomorphism ) graph on 3 vertices with exactly @xmath83 edges .",
    "thus ( [ eq2 ] ) shows @xmath84 , but this could only be sharp if _ all _ induced subgraphs of order @xmath57 were isomorphic to @xmath85 .",
    "this is impossible for @xmath86 .",
    "indeed , suppose we have @xmath87 with @xmath88 a non - edge , and @xmath89 such that @xmath90 and @xmath91 all induce copies of @xmath85 in @xmath20 .",
    "then as @xmath20 is triangle - free , @xmath92 must induce a copy of @xmath93 .",
    "we therefore expect the density of @xmath93 in @xmath20 to be bounded below by some function of @xmath85 ( the density of @xmath94 being determined by the fact that @xmath95 ) .",
    "thus one way we could try to refine inequality  ( [ eq2 ] ) would be to take such a relationship and exploit it to improve our bound .",
    "the simplest relationship of this kind we could hope for is a linear inequality for subgraph densities of the form @xmath96 given such an inequality , inequality  ( [ eq2 ] ) can be changed to @xmath97 provided our linear inequality is ` good ' , the @xmath98 ` even out ' the coefficients @xmath99 by transferring weight from dense subgraphs to sparser ones , improving on  ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "following this line of thought , we then ask ourselves : how can we produce ( good ) linear inequalities for subgraph densities ?",
    "our remark on the fact that we can not pack a graph full of induced copies of @xmath85 suggests a possible answer : we can consider the ways in which different kinds of subgraphs can intersect , and from this information derive bounds on subgraph densities .",
    "what razborov s flag algebra calculus gives us is an efficient formalism for doing just that , which we now present .",
    "suppose we work in the general framework of @xmath25-free graphs .",
    "( our example had @xmath100 . )",

    "then @xmath127in other words , @xmath125 is exactly the edge - density of @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath128 measures something slightly more complicated : letting @xmath129 and writing @xmath130 for the degree of @xmath131 in @xmath20 , we have @xmath132 more interesting from a combinatorial perspective is @xmath133 which in a triangle - free graph measures the @xmath85 density ( divided by @xmath57 ) .    now , let us fix @xmath134 and make two easy observations .",
    "firstly , if @xmath129 is sufficiently large , then picking two random extensions of order @xmath112 for a randomly labelled set of @xmath135 vertices is essentially the same thing as picking a random pair of _ disjoint _ extensions  indeed the probability that two randomly chosen @xmath122-sets from @xmath69 intersect is @xmath136 .    [ indep ] for all @xmath117 , for all possible partial labellings @xmath121 of @xmath69 with labels from @xmath101 , @xmath137 in particular ,",
    "taking expectations over @xmath121 on both sides , we have @xmath138    secondly , we can average :    [ average ] let @xmath75 be any integer with @xmath139 , and let @xmath76 be the family of all ( up to isomorphism ) admissible subgraphs of order @xmath75 defined earlier .",
    "then for all @xmath117 , @xmath140    the appearance of the @xmath68 terms in observation  [ average ] suggests we are close to achieving our goal . and",
    "indeed , let @xmath141 be any fixed positive semi - definite @xmath142 matrix with entries indexed by @xmath106",
    ". then @xmath143 by changing order of summation again in the last line .",
    "this is of the desired form @xmath144 ( the @xmath136 error term being irrelevant when bounding the turn density ) .",
    "thus for a fixed @xmath75 , every choice of @xmath101 and @xmath107 such that @xmath145 , and positive semi - definite matrix @xmath141 , gives us some linear inequality between subgraph densities for admissible subgraphs of order @xmath75 . we can then sum these inequalities together .",
    "for example , if we have @xmath42 choices @xmath146 we can add the corresponding inequalities  ( [ singletype ] ) to get @xmath147 with a view to getting the best possible improvement of  ( [ eq2 ] ) , we can , for a fixed choice of @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , optimise the choice of the matrices @xmath152 to obtain a ` best inequality possible ' : @xmath153 where @xmath154 we can add this to ( [ eq1 ] ) to get @xmath155 and thus obtain a bound on the turn density of our family @xmath25 of forbidden subgraphs , @xmath156 we refer to ( [ fab ] ) as the _ flag algebra bound _ , and for each @xmath157 we call @xmath99 the _ flag algebra coefficient _ of @xmath58 in the bound .    at this point ,",
    "let us make two important observations :    [ tightcoeff ] suppose the flag algebra bound is tight , i.e. @xmath158 and there is an admissible subgraph @xmath159 whose flag algebra coefficient is @xmath160 where @xmath161 .",
    "then , for any sequence of @xmath25-free graphs @xmath162 with @xmath163 and @xmath164 , we have @xmath165    indeed , suppose @xmath166 for some fixed @xmath31",
    ". then by ( [ prefab ] ) , we have @xmath167 which is less than @xmath29 for @xmath60 large enough , a contradiction .",
    "similarly , a consequence of requiring the flag algebra bound to be tight is that @xmath168 for all our optimised choices of @xmath169 and graphs @xmath20 that are ` close ' to being extremal .",
    "additionally , if the problem is stable with a blow - up or iterated blow - up construction of some finite @xmath57-graph being best possible , let us consider for a moment the ` limit ' of a sequence of extremal configurations @xmath36 as @xmath28 . for all @xmath114 , the quantity @xmath170 is determined ( up to @xmath171 ) by the parts in which we set the labelled vertices ; in particular if @xmath121 and @xmath172 place the same labels in the same parts , then @xmath173 for all choices of @xmath102 , and we may treat @xmath121 and @xmath172 as being ` equivalent '",
    ". we can reduce in this way the set of all partial labelings into a finite set of ` equivalence ' classes .    to illustrate this informal discussion with an example ,",
    "suppose the extremal configurations @xmath36 consist of complete balanced bipartite graphs and that @xmath174 .",
    "then there are two ` equivalence ' classes of partial labelings : one in which both labelled vertices are put in the same part of @xmath36 , and one in which the labelled vertices are assigned to different parts of @xmath36 .",
    "now for each ` equivalence ' class , choose a sequence of distinct representatives , i.e. a sequence of partial labelings of @xmath60-vertex extremal configurations , and write @xmath175 for the finite set of sequences thus defined .",
    "since @xmath141 is positive semi - definite , we have the following :    [ zeroevec ] suppose the flag algebra bound is tight , and that the problem admits a blow - up or an iterated blow - up as the stable extremal configuration .",
    "let @xmath169 be one of our optimised choices of intersection type , flag order and matrix .",
    "then for any @xmath176 , where @xmath175 is the set of sequences of partial labelings informally defined above , @xmath177    in other words , the vectors of flag densities associated with a fixed embedding of @xmath101 in a large extremal configuration accumulate around the set consisting of the zero vector and of the zero eigenvectors of the positive semi - definite matrix @xmath141 .",
    "this remark was first made in a more formal infinitary setting by baber  ( lemma 2.4.4 in  @xcite ) , to whom we refer the reader for a rigorous proof .",
    "having made these two observations , let us return to our running example as an illustration of how razborov s method is used to provide upper bounds for turn densities . recall that we are trying to show @xmath178 using the flag algebra calculus",

    "we have two @xmath101-flags of order @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and three admissible subgraphs of order @xmath57 , @xmath179 and @xmath85 ( see figures [ admissiblegraphs ] and [ typeandflags ] ) .",
