    "the possibility of observing large cp violating asymmetries in the decay of @xmath5 mesons motivates the construction of high luminosity @xmath5 factories at several of the world s high energy physics laboratories .",
    "the theoretical and the experimental signatures of these asymmetries have been extensively discussed elsewhere@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite . at asymmetric @xmath5 factories , it is possible to measure the time dependence of @xmath5 decays and therefore time dependent rate asymmetries of neutral @xmath5 decays due to @xmath6 mixing .",
    "the measurement of time dependent asymmetries in the exclusive modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 will allow the determination of the angles in the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa unitarity triangle .",
    "this type of cp violation has been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "another type of cp violation also exists in @xmath5 decays , direct cp violation in the @xmath5 decay amplitudes .",
    "this type of cp violation in @xmath5 decays has also been discussed by several authors although not as extensively . for charged @xmath5 decays calculation of the magnitudes of the effects for some exclusive modes and inclusive modes have been carried out@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in contrast to asymmetries induced by @xmath9 mixing , the magnitudes have large hadronic uncertainties , especially for the exclusive modes .",
    "observation of these asymmetries can be used to rule out the superweak class of models@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe several quasi - inclusive experimental signatures which could provide useful information on direct cp violation at the high luminosity facilities of the future .",
    "one of the goals is to increase the number of events available at experiments for observing a cp asymmetry .",
    "in particular we examine the inclusive decay of the neutral and the charged @xmath5 to either a charged @xmath10 or a charged @xmath11 meson . by applying the appropriate cut on the kaon ( or @xmath11 ) energy one can isolate a signal with little background from @xmath12 transitions .",
    "furthermore , these quasi - inclusive modes are expected to have less hadronic uncertainty than the exclusive modes , would have larger branching ratios and , compared to the purely inclusive modes they may have larger cp asymmetries . in this paper",
    "we will consider modes of the type @xmath13 that have the strange quark only in the @xmath14-meson .    in the sections which follow ,",
    "we describe the experimental signature and method .",
    "we then calculate the rates and asymmetries for inclusive @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays .",
    "in the @xmath18 center of mass frame , the momentum of the @xmath19 from quasi - two body @xmath5 decays such as @xmath20 may have momenta above the kinematic limit for @xmath19 mesons from @xmath21 transitions .",
    "this provides an experimental signature for @xmath17 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 decays where @xmath24 denotes a gluon . this kinematic separation between @xmath21 and @xmath17 transitions",
    "is illustrated by a generator level monte carlo simulation in figure 1 for the case of @xmath25 .",
    "( the @xmath26 spectrum will be similiar ) .",
    "this experimental signature can be applied to the asymmetric energy @xmath5 factories if one boosts backwards along the z axis into the @xmath18 center of mass frame .    since there is a large background ( `` continuum '' ) from the non - resonant processes @xmath27 where @xmath28 , experimental cuts on the event shape are also imposed . to provide additional continuum suppression ,",
    "the `` b reconstruction '' technique has been employed .",
    "the requirement that the kaon and @xmath29 other pions form a system consistent in beam constrained mass and energy with a @xmath5 meson dramatically reduces the background .",
    "after these requirements are imposed , one searches for an excess in the kaon momentum spectrum above the @xmath21 region . only one combination per event",
    "is chosen .",
    "no effort is made to unfold the feed - across between submodes with different values of n.    3.4 truein    methods similar to these have been successfully used by the cleo  ii experiment to isolate a signal in the inclusive single photon energy spectrum and measure the branching fraction for inclusive @xmath30 transitions and to set upper limits on @xmath31 transitions@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is clear from these studies that the @xmath5 reconstruction method provides adequate continuum background suppression",

    "@xmath39    in case of multiple entries for a decay mode , we choose the best entry on the basis of a @xmath40 formed from the beam constrained mass and energy difference ( i.e. @xmath41 ) . in case of multiple decay modes per event , the best decay mode candidate is picked on the basis of the same @xmath40 .",
    "cross - feed between different @xmath42 decay modes ( i.e. the misclassification of decay modes ) provided the @xmath19 is correctly identified , is not a concern as the goal is to extract an inclusive signal .",
    "the purpose of the @xmath5 reconstruction method is to reduce continuum background .",
    "as the multiplicity of the decay mode increases , however , the probability of misrecontruction will increase .",
    "the signal is isolated as excess @xmath19 production in the high momentum signal region ( @xmath43 gev ) above continuum background . to reduce contamination from high momentum @xmath44 production and residual @xmath21 background",
    ", we assume the presence of a high momentum particle identification system as will be employed in the babar , belle , and cleo  iii experiments .",
    "we propose to measure the asymmetry @xmath45 where @xmath46 originates from a partially reconstructed @xmath5 decay such as @xmath47 where the additional pions have net charge @xmath48 and @xmath49 and one neutral pion is allowed and @xmath50 gev .",
    "we assume that the contribution from @xmath51 decays has been removed by cutting on the @xmath52 region in @xmath4 mass .",

    "the wilson coefficients @xmath72 are defined at the scale @xmath73 and have been evaluated to next - to - leading order in qcd .",

    "we assume that the final state phases calculated at the quark level will be a good approximation to the sizes and the signs of the fsi phases at the hadronic level for quasi - inclusive decays when the final state particles are quite energetic as is the case for the @xmath5 decays in the kinematic range of experimental interest@xcite .",
    "we proceed to calculate the matrix elements of the form @xmath92 which represents the process @xmath93 and where @xmath94 has been described above .",
    "the effective hamiltonian consists of operators with a current @xmath95 current structure .",
    "pairs of such operators can be expressed in terms of color singlet and color octet structures which lead to color singlet and color octet matrix elements . in the factorization approximation ,",
    "one separates out the currents in the operators by inserting the vacuum state and neglecting any qcd interactions between the two currents .",
    "the basis for this approximation is that , if the quark pair created by one of the currents carries large energy then it will not have significant qcd interactions . in this approximation",
    "the color octet matrix element does not contribute because it can not be expressed in a factorizable color singlet form . in our case , since the energy of the quark pairs that either creates the @xmath10 or the @xmath4 state is rather large , factorization is likely to be a good first approximation . to accommodate some deviation from this approximation we treat @xmath79 , the number of colors that enter in the calculation of the matrix elements , as a free parameter . in our calculation",
    "we will see how our results vary with different choices of @xmath79 .",
    "the value of @xmath96 is suggested by experimental data on low multiplicity hadronic @xmath5 decays@xcite .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath97 can in general be split into a three body and a two body part .",
    "detailed expressions for the matrix elements , decay distributions and asymmetries can be found in @xcite",
    "in this section we discuss the results of our calculations . we find that there can be significant asymmetries in @xmath98 decays especially in the region @xmath99 gev which is also the region where an experimental signal for such decays can be isolated .",
    "the branching ratios are of order @xmath100 which are within reach for future b factories .",
    "the contribution of the amplitude with the top quark in the loop accounts for 60 - 75% of the inclusive branching fraction .",
    "however , since the top quark amplitude is large and has no absorptive part in contrast to the c quark amplitude , the top quark contribution reduces the net cp asymmetry from 30 - 50% to about 10% .",
    "this calculation includes the contribution from electroweak penguins .",
    "we find that the electroweak penguin contributions increase the decay rates by 10 - 20% but reduce the overall asymmetry by 20 - 30% .",
    "the main sources of uncertainties in our calculation are discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "2.8 truein   2.8 truein    the asymmetries are sensitive to the values of the wolfenstein parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "as already mentioned , our calculation is not free of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "two strong assumptions used in our calculation are the use of quark level strong phases for the fsi phases at the hadronic level and the choice of the value of the gluon momentum @xmath115 in the two body decays .",
    "other uncertainties from the use of different heavy to light form factors , the use of factorization , the model of the b meson wavefunction , the value of the charm quark mass and the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath116 have smaller effects on the asymmetries @xcite .",
