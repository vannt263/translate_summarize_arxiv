    "since the leading paper by morris and thorne @xcite the study of traversable lorentzian wormholes has received considerable attention .",
    "these objects are solutions of the equations of gravitation that have two regions ( of the same universe or may be of two separate universes @xcite ) connected by a throat . for static wormholes ,",
    "the throat is defined as a two - dimensional hypersurface of minimal area that must satisfy a _",
    "flare - out _",
    "condition @xcite .",
    "all traversable wormholes include _ exotic matter _ , which violates the null energy condition ( nec ) @xcite .",
    "interesting discussions about the energy conditions and wormholes are given in the essays by barcel and visser @xcite and by roman @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in quantifying the amount of _ exotic matter _ present around the throat .",
    "@xcite showed that the _ exotic matter _ can be made infinitesimally small by appropriately choosing the geometry of the wormhole , and nandi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a precise volume integral quantifier for the average null energy condition ( anec ) violating matter .",
    "this quantifier was subsequently used by nandi and zhang @xcite as a test of the physical viability of traversable wormholes . a well studied class of wormholes",
    "are thin - shell ones , which are constructed by cutting and pasting two manifolds @xcite to form a geodesically complete new one with a throat placed in the joining shell .",
    "thus , the _ exotic matter _ needed to build the wormhole is located at the shell and the junction - condition formalism is used for its study .",
    "poisson and visser @xcite made a linearized stability analysis under spherically symmetric perturbations of a thin - shell wormhole constructed by joining two schwarzschild geometries .",
    "later , eiroa and romero @xcite extended the linearized stability analysis to reissner ",
    "nordstrm thin - shell geometries , and lobo and crawford @xcite to wormholes with a cosmological constant .",
    "lobo , with the intention of minimizing the _ exotic matter _ used , matched a static and spherically symmetric wormhole solution to an exterior vacuum solution with a cosmological constant , and he calculated the surface stresses of the resulting shell @xcite , and the total amount of _ exotic matter _ using a volume integral quantifier @xcite .",
    "cylindrically symmetric thin - shell wormhole geometries associated to gauge cosmic strings have also been treated by the authors of the present work @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we study spherical thin - shell wormholes in dilaton gravity , that is , wormholes constructed by cutting and pasting two metrics corresponding to a charged black hole which is a solution of low energy string theory , with dilaton and maxwell fields , but vanishing antisymmetric field and all other gauge fields set to zero @xcite .",
    "lorentzian four dimensional traversable wormholes in the context of low energy effective string theory or in einstein gravity with a massless scalar field were already proposed by kim and kim @xcite , vollick @xcite , barcel and visser @xcite , bronnikov and grinyok @xcite , armendriz - picn @xcite , graf @xcite , nandi and zhang @xcite , and nandi _ et al . _",
