    "random plane maps and their scaling limits are a sort of two - dimensional analog of random walks and brownian motion , in which one wants to approximate a random continuous surface using large random graphs drawn on the @xmath3-sphere @xcite .",
    "a _ plane map _ is a proper embedding , without edge - crossings , of a finite connected graph in the two - dimensional sphere .",
    "loops or multiple edges are allowed .",
    "we say that a map is _ rooted _ if one of its oriented edges , called the root , is distinguished .",
    "two ( rooted ) maps @xmath4 are considered equivalent if there exists a direct homeomorphism of the sphere that maps @xmath5 onto @xmath6 ( and maps the root of @xmath5 to that of @xmath6 with preserved orientations ) .",
    "equivalent maps will systematically be identified in the sequel , so that the set of maps is a countable set with this convention .    from a combinatorial and probabilistic perspective , the maps called _ quadrangulations _ , which will be the central object of study in this work , are among the simplest to manipulate .",
    "recall that the _ faces _ of a map are the connected component of the complement of the embedding .",
    "a map is called a quadrangulation if all its faces have degree @xmath7 , where the degree of a face is the number of edges that are incident to it ( an edge which is incident to only one face has to be counted twice in the computation of the degree of this face ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be the set of plane , rooted quadrangulations , and @xmath9 be the set of elements of @xmath8 with @xmath0 faces .",
    "let @xmath10 be uniformly distributed in @xmath9 .",
    "we identify @xmath10 with the finite metric space @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the set of vertices of @xmath10 , and @xmath13 is the usual graph distance on @xmath12 .",
    "we see @xmath10 as a random variable with values in the space @xmath14 of compact metric spaces considered up to isometry . the space @xmath14 is endowed with the gromov - hausdorff topology @xcite : the distance between two elements @xmath15 in @xmath14 is given by @xmath16 where the infimum is taken over all _ correspondences _ @xmath17 between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.e.  subsets of @xmath20 whose canonical projections @xmath21 are onto , and @xmath22 is the _ distortion _ of @xmath17 , defined by @xmath23 the space @xmath24 is then a separable and complete metric space @xcite",
    ".    it turns out that typical graph distances in @xmath10 are of order @xmath25 as @xmath2 , as was shown in a seminal paper by chassaing & schaeffer @xcite .",
    "since then , much attention has been drawn by the problem of studying the scaling limit of @xmath10 , i.e.  to study the asymptotic properties of the space @xmath26 as @xmath2 .",
    "le gall @xcite obtained a compactness result , namely that the laws of @xmath27 , form a relatively compact family of probability distributions on @xmath14 .",
    "this means that along suitable subsequences , the sequence @xmath28 converges in distribution in @xmath14 to some limiting space .",
    "such limiting spaces are called `` brownian maps '' , so as to recall the fact that brownian motion arises as the scaling limit of discrete random walks .",
    "many properties satisfied by _ any _ brownian map ( i.e.  by any limit in distribution of @xmath28 along some subsequence ) are known . in particular",
    ", le gall showed that their topology is independent of the choice of a subsequence @xcite .",
    "then le gall & paulin identified this topology with the topology of the 2-dimensional sphere @xcite . besides , the convergence of _ two - point functions _ and _ three - point functions _ , that is , of the joint laws of rescaled distances between @xmath3 or @xmath29 randomly chosen vertices in @xmath12 , was also established respectively by chassaing & schaeffer @xcite and bouttier & guitter @xcite .",
    "these convergences occur without having to extract subsequences .",
    "see @xcite for a recent survey of the field .",
    "it is thus natural to conjecture that all brownian maps should in fact have the same distribution , and that the use of subsequences in the approximation by quadrangulations is superfluous .",
    "a candidate for a limiting space ( which is sometimes also called the brownian map , although is was not proved that this space arises as the limit of @xmath28 along some subsequence ) was described in equivalent , but slightly different forms , by marckert and mokkadem @xcite and le gall @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to prove these conjectures , namely , that @xmath28 converges in distribution as @xmath2 to the conjectured limit of @xcite .",
    "this unifies the several existing definitions of brownian map we just described , and lifts the ambiguity that there could have been more than one limiting law along a subsequence for @xmath28 .    in order to state our main result ,",
    "let us describe the limiting brownian map .",
    "this space can be described from a pair of random processes @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 is the so - called _ normalized brownian excursion_. it can be seen as a positive excursion of standard brownian motion conditioned to have duration @xmath32 .",
    "the process @xmath33 is the so - called _ head of the brownian snake _ driven by @xmath34 : conditionally given @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a centered gaussian process with continuous trajectories , satisfying @xmath36=d_{\\mathbf{e}}(s , t)\\ , \\qquad s , t\\in [ 0,1]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath37 the function @xmath38 defines a pseudo - distance on @xmath39 $ ] : this means that @xmath38 satisfies the properties of a distance , excepting separation , so that it can hold that @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "we let @xmath42/\\{d_{\\mathbf{e}}=0\\}$ ] , and denote the canonical projection by @xmath43\\to { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\mathbf{e}}$ ] .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath38 passes to the quotient to a distance function on @xmath44 , still called @xmath38 .",
    "the space @xmath45 is called aldous _ continuum random tree_. the definition of @xmath35 implies that a.s . , for every @xmath46 such that @xmath40 , one has @xmath47 . therefore , it is convenient to view @xmath35 as a function @xmath48 indexed by @xmath44 . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath35 can be viewed as the brownian motion indexed by the brownian tree .",

    "this motivates writing , for @xmath57 , @xmath58 the function @xmath59 is now a pseudo - distance on @xmath44 , and we finally define @xmath60 which we endow with the quotient distance , still denoted by @xmath59 .",
    "alternatively , letting , for @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 one can note that @xmath63 can also be defined as the quotient metric space @xmath39/\\{d^*=0\\}$ ] .",

    "the function @xmath68 is called a _ geodesic _ from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following .",
    "[ sec : introduction-4 ] as @xmath2 , the metric space @xmath71 converges in distribution for the gromov - hausdorff topology on @xmath14 to the space @xmath64 .",
    "the strategy of the proof is to obtain properties of the geodesic paths that have to be satisfied in any distributional limit of @xmath28 , and which are sufficient to give `` formulas '' for distances in these limiting spaces that do not depend on the choice of subsequences .",
    "an important object of study is the occurence of certain types of _ geodesic stars _ in the brownian map , i.e.  of points from which radiate several disjoint geodesic _",
    "we hope that the present study will pave the way to a deeper understanding of geodesic stars in the brownian map .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the next section recalls an important construction from @xcite of the potential limits in distributions of the spaces @xmath28 , which will allow to reformulate slightly theorem [ sec : introduction-4 ] into the alternative theorem [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "then we show how the proof of theorem [ sec : introduction ] can be obtained as a consequence of two intermediate statements , propositions [ sec : introduction-1 ] and [ sec : th1 ] .",
    "section  [ sec : rough - comp - betw ] is devoted to the proof of the first proposition , while section [ sec : exceptional - nature-3 - 4 ] reduces the proof of proposition [ sec : th1 ] to two key `` elementary '' statements , lemmas [ sec : covering-3-star ] and [ sec : covering-3-star-1 ] , which deal with certain properties of geodesic stars in the brownian map , with two or three arms .",
    "the proofs of these lemmas contains most of the novel ideas and techniques of the paper . using a generalization of the cori - vauquelin - schaeffer bijection found in @xcite ,",
    "we will be able to translate the key statements in terms of certain probabilities for families of labeled maps , which have a simple enough structure so that we are able to derive their scaling limits .",
    "these discrete and continuous structures will be described in sections [ sec : coding - labeled - maps ] and [ sec : scal - limits - label ] , while section [ sec : proof - key - lemmas ] is finally devoted to the proof of the two key lemmas .",
    "let us end this introduction by mentioning that , simultaneously to the elaboration of this work , jean - franois le gall independently found a proof of theorem [ sec : introduction-4 ] .",

    "if @xmath85 is not oriented , we say that @xmath82 and @xmath78 are incident if @xmath82 is incident to @xmath78 or @xmath80 .",
    "a similar definition holds for incidence between @xmath83 and @xmath78 .",
    "finally , we say that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are incident if @xmath83 and @xmath82 are incident to a common @xmath86 .",
    "the sets of vertices , edges and oriented edges incident to a face @xmath82 are denoted by @xmath87 .",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath88 for vertices and edges simultaneously incident to the two faces @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a map and @xmath90 are vertices of @xmath5 , a _ chain _ from @xmath83 to @xmath91 is a finite sequence @xmath92 of oriented edges , such that @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for every @xmath95 .",
    "the integer @xmath96 is called the length of the chain , and we allow also the chain of length @xmath97 from @xmath83 to itself .",
    "the _ graph distance _ @xmath98 in @xmath5 described above is then the minimal @xmath96 such that there exists a chain with length @xmath96 from @xmath83 to @xmath91 .",
    "a chain with minimal length is called a _",

    "unless specified otherwise , the random variables considered in this paper are supposed to be defined on a probability space @xmath100 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is known that the laws of the rescaled quadrangulations @xmath101 form a compact sequence of distributions on @xmath14 . therefore , from every subsequence , it is possible to further extract a subsequence along which @xmath101 converges in distribution to a random variable @xmath102 with values in @xmath14 .",
    "theorem [ sec : introduction-4 ] then simply boils down to showing that this limit has the same distribution as @xmath64 , independently on the choices of subsequences .    in order to be able to compare efficiently the spaces @xmath102 and @xmath64 , we perform a particular construction , due to @xcite , for which the spaces are the same quotient space , i.e.  @xmath103 .",
    "this is not restrictive , in the sense that this construction can always be performed up to ( yet ) further extraction .",
    "we recall some of its important aspects .",
    "recall that a quadrangulation @xmath104 , together with a distinguished vertex @xmath105 can be encoded by a labeled tree with @xmath0 edges _ via _ the so - called cori - vauquelin - schaeffer bijection , which was introduced by cori and vauquelin @xcite , and considerably developed by schaeffer , starting with his thesis @xcite .",
    "if @xmath106 is the resulting labeled tree , then the vertices of @xmath107 distinct from @xmath105 are exactly the vertices of @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is , up to a shift by its global minimum over @xmath108 , the function giving the graph distances to @xmath105 in @xmath107 . in turn",
    ", the tree @xmath106 can be conveniently encoded by _ contour and label functions _ :",
    "heuristically , this function returns the height ( distance to the root of @xmath108 ) and label of the vertex visited at time @xmath110 when going around the tree clockwise .",

    "if @xmath112 is a uniform random variable in @xmath9 and @xmath105 is uniform among the @xmath113 vertices of @xmath10 , then the resulting labeled tree @xmath114 has a contour and label function @xmath115 such that @xmath116 is a simple random walk in @xmath117 , starting at @xmath97 and ending at @xmath97 at time @xmath118 , and conditioned to stay non - negative .",

    "then , the distributions of the triples of processes @xmath124 form a relatively compact family of probability distributions . therefore , from every subsequence , we can further extract a certain subsequence @xmath125 , along which the above triples converge in distribution to a limit @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is a random pseudo - distance on @xmath39 $ ] , and @xmath30 is the head of the brownian snake process described in the introduction .",
