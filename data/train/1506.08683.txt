    "darwinian adaptation spontaneously emerges from the processes of mutation , reproduction and competition , and these features need to be mirrored in any model of adaptation . in models , spontaneous mutations can be represented by a stochastic jump process in a `` fitness space '' .",
    "reproduction is naturally described by a branching process by which individuals give birth at certain fitness - dependent rates  @xcite . in combination , reproduction and mutations",
    "thus generate a branching random walk  @xcite , which by itself would lead to diverging population sizes . to avoid this unrealistic outcome , models of adaptation also encode a constraint on population sizes to account for the competition for finite resources .",
    "the resulting process is a branching random walk subject to a global constraint , which we now frame mathematically .",
    "the state of the population at time @xmath0 is described by a function @xmath1 representing the number density of individuals with fitness @xmath2 . in this context",
    ", fitness refers to an individual s net - growth rate in the absence of competition for resources .",
    "the population is assumed to evolve in discrete timesteps of size @xmath3 , which is eventually sent to zero in order to obtain a continuous - time markov process .",
    "each timestep consists of two sub - steps .",
    "the first substep realizes reproduction and mutations and the second substep implements competition .",
    "the combined effect of reproductions and mutations can be described by the stochastic equation @xmath4 which takes the number density @xmath5 to an intermediate value @xmath6 .",
    "the term @xmath7 represents the _ expected _ change in density due to reproduction and mutations .",
    "this term is linear in the number density because the number of offspring and mutants per timestep is proportional to the current population density .",
    "the term @xmath8 represents all sources of noise arising in this setup .",
    "we will now discuss separately the precise meaning of both terms , and give natural alternatives for their form .    the liouville operator @xmath9 depends on how the mutational process is modeled , and various examples are discussed in the following .",
    "a particularly simple example is provided by @xmath10 , which has been used to model asexual evolution on a continuous fitness landscape  @xcite . here",
    ", the diffusion constant @xmath11 quantifies the fitness variance per generation , generated by an influx of novel mutations . to account for the notorious observation that most mutations are deleterious , a drift term @xmath12 is often included .",
    "the linear `` reaction '' term @xmath13 in @xmath9 simply accounts for the fact that individuals with higher growth rate @xmath2 grow faster .",
    "the term @xmath14 refers to the mean fitness of the population , which separates the population with a positive net growth rate @xmath15 from the less fit part of the population with @xmath16 .",
    "one can not generally assume that ( biased ) diffusion is a good model for discrete mutational events because of the presence of the reaction term favoring highly fit individuals .",
    "the diffusion approximation requires that mutation rates are higher than the typical fitness effects of novel mutations .",
    "this may apply to rapidly mutating organisms , such as viruses , or close to a dynamic mutation - selection balance  @xcite .",
    "it may also effectively apply in island models with low migration rates , where the fitness effect of a mutation is reduced by potentially low migration rates .",
    "but , in well - mixed populations , the diffusion approach breaks down when beneficial mutation rates are much smaller than their typical effect , which has been confirmed for a number of microbial species when they adapt to new environments  @xcite .",
    "more generally , asexual adaptation may , therefore , be cast into the form @xmath17 where the mutational process is described by the operator @xmath18 , which conserves particle numbers , i.e. , describes a pure jump process .",
    "for instance , one may have one of the time - independent kernels @xmath19\\ ; , & \\text{staircase kernel } \\\\\\int    \\mu(y ) \\left [ c_t(x - y)-c_t(y ) \\right ] dy\\ ; ,   & \\text{general mutational      kernel}\\end{matrix }   \\;\\right.\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is a mutation rate and @xmath21 is a characteristic scale for the mutational effect .",
    "the diffusion kernel is the simplest of these kernels because it is characterized by only one compound parameter , the diffusion constant @xmath22 , rather than two in the staircase kernel or an entire function @xmath23 in the general case .    the stochastic term @xmath24 in equation accounts for all random factors that influence the reproduction process .",
    "the function @xmath25 represents standard white noise , i.e. a set of delta correlated random numbers , @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the ensemble average of a random variable @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the dirac delta function and the kronecker delta , respectively . the amplitude @xmath31 of the noise term in eq .",
    "is typical for number fluctuations : due to the law of large number , the expected variance in population numbers from one timestep to the next is proportional to the number @xmath32 of expected births or deaths during one timestep .",
    "the numerical coefficient @xmath33 is the variance in offspring number per individual .",
    "for instance , when we assume that offspring have nearly matching division and death rates one finds @xmath34 .",
    "the variance in offspring number is typically assumed to be of order one , but could become much larger if offspring distributions are highly - skewed , as it is the case when few individuals produce most of the offspring  @xcite .      because the reproduction step generally changes population numbers , another sub - step , following the branching process ,",
    "is required to enforce a constant population size   denotes the _ mean fitness _ of the population , the action of the liouvillean @xmath35 does not change the _ expected _ number of individuals in the population .",
    "however , fluctuations in the reproduction implemented by genetic drift will result in slight deviations from this expected outcome .",
    "these deviations accumulate over time and either lead to extinction or an ever increasing population size .",
    "] , @xmath36 in most models and experiments  @xcite , this step is realized by a random culling of the population : individuals are eliminated at random from the population until the population size constraint is restored .",
    "mathematically , the population control step can be cast into the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the fraction of the population that has to be removed to comply with the population size constraint .",
    "the second sub - step completes the computational timestep , and takes the concentration field from the intermediate state @xmath39 to the properly constrained state @xmath40 .",
    "the above standard model of adaptation with fixed population size represents a branching random walk subject to the constraint that the total population size is fixed . enforcing this constraint leads to the non - linearity that makes the associated model difficult to solve .",
    "note that , in the above formulation , it is assumed that all noise comes from birth - death processes .",
    "we have ignored , for simplicity , additional sources of noise due to , e.g. the mutational jump processes , which are sub - dominant in large populations .",
    "while it is necessary to constrain the population dynamics to avoid an exponential run - away , there is no particular biological reason to strictly fix the population size - in fact , most population sizes fluctuate over time  @xcite .",
    "as we will see , there are , however , mathematical reasons to consider constraints of particular form , which greatly simplify the analysis .    as a key step towards these tuned models , we note the fixed population size constraint eq .",
    "can be viewed as one member of a whole class of linear constraints , @xmath41 that one could formulate with the help of a suitable weighting function @xmath42 .",
    "any such constraint will be able to limit the population size , and thus defines , together with the liouvillean @xmath43 , a particular model of adaptation .",
    "our main result will be the observation that there are an entire set of weighting functions for which the dynamics of the model becomes simple ( cf .",
    "[ sec : main - results ] ) .",
    "note that one recovers the fixed population size constraint of one chooses the weighting function @xmath42 to be a constant , @xmath44 . for any other choice",
    ", the population size will not be fixed . at best , one obtains a steady state with a population size fluctuating around its mean value , @xmath45 , which may change depending on the time - dependence imposed on the weighting function @xmath46 .",
    "note that culling is does not discriminate among individuals of different fitness .",
    "it is only the _ amount _ of culling that depends on the distribution and type of individuals if @xmath42 is @xmath2dependent .",
    "one advantage of using the general form eq .   for a global constraint",
    "is that many types of traveling waves arising in ecology and evolution can be cast in the same mathematical form , if an appropriate liouville operator and weighting function are used",
    ".     indicated in green .",
    "note that for conventional models of adaptation with fixed population size , the growth rates are increasing with fitness and the weighting function is a constant .",
    "by contrast , for models of species invasion or range expansion without allee effect  @xcite , the growth rates and weighting function have a sigmoidal shape , saturating in the tip of the wave .",
    "this ensures that individuals in the tip of the wave have the highest growth rates ( because of least competition ) and that their total number stays finite . ]",
    "we would like to give an example of this assertion .",
    "[ fig : noisy - wave - schema]b illustrates the expansion of a population in a real landscape , which may describe an advantageous gene spreading through a population distributed in space , or the invasion of virgin territory by an introduced species .",
    "models of such real - space waves require the following features : i ) populations reproduce and die `` freely '' in the tip of the wave , where population densities are small , ii ) individuals move in real - space according to some jump process and iii ) the net - growth vanishes in the bulk of the wave , where resources are sparse .    features i ) and ii ) again generate a branching - random walk in the tip of the wave , however , according to different position - dependent growth and jump rates than in the case of evolution .",
    "feature iii ) requires a finite population size in the tip of the wave .",
    "this non - linearity keeps the branching - random walk away from proliferating to infinite densities , where mean - field models apply .    to generate an adequate branching - random walk",
    ", one has to use an appropriate liouville operator . in one dimensions ,",
    "one can choose , for instance , @xmath47 now , @xmath2 refers to the location in one - dimensional real space .",
    "@xmath48 refers to the position of the cross - over to the bulk of the wave .",
    "the operator @xmath18 generates a jump process . in the simplest case , again , the jump process may be approximated by a diffusive process , @xmath49 .",
    "the growth term does not need to be modeled by a strict step - function , any sigmoidal function works in the limit of large population sizes @xcite .",
    "importantly , the net reproduction rates monotonously increase in @xmath2 and saturates at some finite value @xmath21 at @xmath50 . finally , to limit the population size in the front of the wave , we need to use a non - constant weighting function @xmath51 in the global constraint , for instance , @xmath52 , which ensures that the growth region contains precisely @xmath53 individuals .    the qualitative difference between the traveling waves in real and fitness space turns out to rely on the growth rates in the nose of the wave : while growth rates are saturating in the case of real - space waves",
    ", it is increasing without bound in the case of waves of adaptation .",
    "this makes models of adaptation even more sensitive to the effects of noise to the extent that a mean - field limit ( neglecting noise ) does not even yield finite velocity waves .",
    "noise serves a crucial function in these models as it is required to regularize the wave dynamics .",
    "these waves have therefore been called `` front - regularized waves ''  @xcite .",
    "in the same way as exemplified above for models of adaptation and invasion , one can frame many other eco - evolutionary scenarios , in their essence , as constrained branching random walks .",
    "these models are , ultimately , defined by an operator @xmath9 generating the branching - random walk and a weighting function @xmath46 defining the global constraint . in this paper , we show that , in fact , for any given @xmath9 there are _ natural _ ways of choosing the weighting function .",
    "the associated models , which we call _ tuned _ models , have desirable properties , including closed and linear moment equations , greatly facilitating their analysis .",
    "we first state our main results on how to construct tuned models at any desired level of moments .",
    "we will then provide an interpretation of these tuned models and provide simulation results , which we compare to fixed population size models .",
    "detailed analytical derivations are given in later sections .",
    "to characterize fluctuations in the makeup of the population it is convenient to consider the so - called @xmath54-point correlation function @xmath55 , which is the noise - average of the product @xmath56 of @xmath54 number density fields , @xmath57 , evaluated at the same time @xmath0 at various locations @xmath58 .",
    "note that , here and henceforth , we use the notations @xmath59 and @xmath60 for a space and time - dependent function interchangeably .    from many studies over the last 15 years , we know a lot about the first moment , @xmath61 , of several models of noisy traveling waves .",
    "this provides access to the _ expected _ shape and velocity of the traveling wave , as well as the _ expected _ fate of individual mutations , or sub - populations .",
    "however , wave shape and velocity fluctuations , as well , as the decay of genetic diversity requires access to higher moments , @xmath62 , for which there is no systematic approach so far .",

    "the arbitrary function @xmath68 controls the mean total population size as a function of time .    for the special weighting function eq .",
    ", the equation of motion for the @xmath63 moment becomes _ closed _ and _ linear _ , @xmath69 the resulting models may be called _ tuned _ , because for all other choices of the weighting function , the equation of motion for @xmath55 involves @xmath70 resulting in an infinite hierarchy of moments .",
    "the moment closure of the tuned models is exact and not due to a truncation or approximation of higher moments .",
    "the two terms @xmath71 are fluctuation - induced terms .",
    "the last , positive term generates correlations at equal space arguments , which are then dissipated by the first , strictly negative , term over longer time scales .",
    "the positive term exists only for @xmath62 and indicates that the effect of genetic drift on higher moments is more complicated than a cut - off in the growth term .",
    "moreover , examining the behavior of differently labeled , but otherwise identical , subpopulations shows that tuned models can be interpreted naturally in the framework of population genetics .",
    "first , the weighting function of all tuned models is a fixation probability function : the probability that descendants of individuals at location @xmath2 and time @xmath0 will take over the population on long times is given precisely by @xmath72 in the model tuned for the @xmath63 moment .",
    "it is remarkable , in this context , that equation eq .   for @xmath65 is precisely the equation governing the survival probability of an _ unconstrained _ branching random walk  @xcite , with @xmath34 .",
    "secondly , the higher moments provide access to the statistics of the genetic makeup of the population . according to the principle tenet of population genetics that , without mutations",
    ", the genetic diversity of a population decreases with time : fixation and extinction of subtypes needs to be maintained by an appropriate influx of mutations .",
    "the decay of genetic diversity fundamentally depends on higher moments  the first moment captures fixation probabilities but not the time to fixation .",
    "the decay of genetic diversity in the absence of mutations can be quantified by the cross - correlation function @xmath73 between subtypes @xmath74 . here , the number densities @xmath75 is the number density field of type @xmath76 .",
    "the sum of all sub - types makes up the total population , @xmath77 .",
    "if all @xmath78 are different and @xmath62 , it is clear that @xmath79 must continuously decay in the absence of mutations because one of the subtypes will take over in the presence of random genetic drift .",
    "the case @xmath80 is the most prominent one : @xmath81 is proportional to the so - called heterozygosity at location @xmath2 and @xmath0 , which is the probability that two individuals sampled with replacement are of different type  @xcite .",
    "now it turns out that , in the @xmath63 -tuned model , the cross - correlation function can be expressed in the simple form @xmath82 with @xmath83 satisfying a one - dimensional linear equation @xmath84 subject to the initial conditions @xmath85 .",
    "notice that the decay of genetic diversity in the @xmath63 -tuned model is described by the spectrum of the operator appearing on the right - hand side of eq .  , which also occurs in eq .",
    "describing the fluctuations of the total population .",
    "consistent with our population genetic interpretation , one can show quite generally that this operator only has decaying relaxation modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum - si ] ) .",
    "we consider eqs .   and to be our results with the most immediate applicability because they provide a feasible approach to resolving a key question in population genetics ( maintenance and decay of genetic diversity ) that _ relies _ on having access to higher moments .",
    "the above formalism includes the case @xmath86 ( closed first moment ) presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in which the tuned weighting function @xmath87 was denoted by @xmath88 ) .    in constrained random walk models ,",
    "one can generally retrieve lower moments from higher moments by contraction with the weighting function @xmath89 , @xmath90 where we invoked the global constraint eq .   in going from the second to the third line .",
    "to simplify the notation , we have here introduced the short hand @xmath91 to denote @xmath92 , i.e. , that the @xmath93th space variable should be omitted in the arguments .",
    "the contraction rule eq",
    ".   also shows that contraction in the last term in the dynamical equation for @xmath94 simply generates the next lower moment @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , if one obtains the @xmath63 moment by solving eq .  , one generally has access to all lower - rank moments as well ( but not to the larger moments ) .",
    "thus , the model tuned to be linear at the @xmath63 moment gives access to all moments up to and including the @xmath63 .",
    "it is remarkable that the governing equations for @xmath96 and @xmath55 are independent of the offspring number variation @xmath33 .",
    "the only effect of @xmath33 is to reduce the fixation probability @xmath97 and scale up the population sizes @xmath98 .",
    "this means in particular that noise - induced terms @xmath99 in the moment equation are not scaled by @xmath33 , and thus do not become small in the small noise limit .",
    "the lack of a potentially small parameter has important consequences for the use of perturbation theory in this context .",
    "we now illustrate our main results by explicit numerical solutions and stochastic simulations for models tuned to be closed at the first and second moment . the two biological phenomena we consider , adaptation and invasion , both give rise to compact traveling waves in real space and fitness space , respectively . they fundamentally differ in their location - dependent growth rates : while in adaptation models , growth rates are linear increasing towards the tip of the waves , they saturate in invasion models . as a consequence ,",
    "invasion waves have a well - defined infinite population size limit in contrast to adaptation waves .",
    "the detailed behavior of simple models of asexual adaptation models varies with the assumptions made about how the mutation process influences the growth rates that define the branching process . in our numerical work ,",
    "we focus on the diffusion kernel in eq .  , which assumes that a growth rate variance @xmath11 is acquired per generation due to mutations .",
    "the advantage of the diffusion kernel is that it only contains one parameter , the diffusion constant @xmath11 , and matters when mutation rates are large compared to the ( effective ) rate of selection  @xcite .",

    "this enables studying questions such as how does mutator strain take over in an evolving population of bacteria even if it confers a direct fitness detriment , or , how does a faster dispersing mutant spreads during a growing tumor even if it might be slower growing ?",
    "moreover , we can discuss the decay of genetic diversity and arrive at the very important conclusion that @xmath114 is always the fixation probability of a neutral mutation arising at position @xmath2 and time @xmath0 by considering exchangeable subtypes .    to this end",

    "e.g. if type @xmath76 would refer to a mutator type , @xmath178 would include a particular mutational operator @xmath181 characterizing the mutator phenotype .",
    "for instance , if mutations are modeled by diffusion , the corresponding diffusion constant of a mutator would be larger than that of the wild type .",
    "the different subtypes are coupled only by the second computational substep @xmath182 which ensures a global constrained defined by a weighting function vector @xmath183 , @xmath184 notice that we have merely added another ( discrete ) dimension to the problem - the type degree of freedoms .",
    "it may be checked that our arguments to arrive at an effective stochastic differential equation and for closing the moment hierarchy in sec .",
    "generalize to any number of dimensions .",
    "thus , we can immediately restate our central results for the extended model accounting for sub - types .    in particular , if we choose the weighting function vector to be @xmath185 with @xmath186{w}_i(x , t)\\;,\\ ] ] then equation of motion for the @xmath63 moment will be closed . if we choose the notation @xmath187 with @xmath78 being the type of the @xmath188 number density field in the product on the right - hand - side .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath63 moment is given by @xmath189 notice that the correlations indicated by the last term only arise for a subpopulation with itself , @xmath190 .",
    "now , let us focus on the special case where types follow the same dynamics in the statistical sense , @xmath191 for such `` exchangeable '' subtypes , it is easy to see that the equation of motion eq .   for the @xmath63 moment of the total population , @xmath192 ,",
    "is obtained upon summing left and right - hand side of eq .   over all type indices , i.e. by carrying out @xmath193 .",
    "we can single out one particular subpopulation , say @xmath194 ( @xmath195 for labeled ) , by summing the equation of motion over all other type indices , @xmath196 .",

    "the diversity of labels in a population will inevitably decline , because of the rise and ultimate fixation of one of the labels initially present .",
    "one can capture the gradual loss of genetic diversity by studying the expectation of the product of density fields that correspond to different types .",
    "for instance , if there are just two types , @xmath212 , the correlation function @xmath213 satisfies @xmath214 notice that the right - hand side of eq .   misses the positive @xmath215function term of eq .  , which characterized the @xmath63 moment of the total population density .",
    "assuming that @xmath216 ( as well as @xmath217 and @xmath218 ) have a stable stationary solution , we can conclude that @xmath130 will decay to @xmath127 at long times because of the lacking source term .",
    "this is to be expected because the gradual fixation of one of the two types implies that @xmath130 has to approach @xmath127 on long times .",
    "discerning relaxation times of the time - evolution is related to a key question in population genetics : how fast do lineages of two individuals coalesce ?    the function @xmath219 is closely related to the so - called heterozygosity in population genetics .",
    "the heterozygosity in the population is the probability that two randomly chosen individuals are of different type , @xmath220 . for our purposes , it is much more convenient and natural to consider a variant of that quantity , @xmath221 with @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "these quantities have nice properties . at any time , both @xmath224 and @xmath225 represent the probability of fixation of the respective subpopulations .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath226 , ensured by the global constraint .",
    "thus , @xmath227 is similar to a heterozygosity in neutral populations and , under certain conditions discussed below , even converges against the actual heterozygosity .",
    "an equation of motion for the expectation @xmath228 can be derived by contracting eq .   twice with @xmath141 and using the equation of motion of @xmath141 , eq .",
    ", @xmath229 notice that the right - hand side is negative always .",
    "thus , again , we see that the heterozygosity will necessarily decay .      as in eq .   for @xmath80 , one can easily see that the equation of motion for @xmath230 is separable for the @xmath54 components if @xmath231 .",
    "it therefore admits a solution of the simple form @xmath232 with @xmath83 satisfying a one - dimensional linear equation @xmath233 subject to the initial conditions @xmath85 . by contracting with @xmath96 and using its dynamics , @xmath234 , @xmath235 we see that @xmath60 must be continuously decaying with time .    on long times",

    "yields an exponential decay @xmath238 of the mode amplitude @xmath239 with a decay time given by @xmath240 intuitively , this decay time describes how long it takes until significant fraction of the population has coalesced .",
    "thus , one expects @xmath241 to depend on the fundamental parameters of the considered model in just the same way as the population coalescence time",
    ". the numerical coefficient , of course , will be different by a factor of order 1 .    due to the one - dimensional nature of eq .",

    "we will provide a heuristic calculation for the case of a diffusive kernel in the limit of large populations ( or fast waves ) .      in most models of noisy traveling waves ,",
    "one has found empirically a time scale separation : for large @xmath243 , the longest relaxation time of the mean density field is much shorter than the coalescence time . in the case of adaptation waves and invasion waves with diffusion kernel ,",

    "( 2 ) a non - linear population regulation makes sure that those branching processes do not get out of control . for",
    "such constrained branching random walks , we have provided a general route towards analyzing fluctuations .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to adjust the population control , an essential non - linearity , in such a way that the equations describing correlation functions of order @xmath54 are closed .",
    "our method can be used to elucidate variability between replicates in evolution experiments as well as the genetic diversity within a population . to provide specific results",
    ", we have focussed on simple models of adaptation and of invasions . in both cases",
    ", we have found that the decay of genetic diversity scales as a power of the logarithm of the population size for large population sizes .",
    "higher moments show a marked anticorrelation between the dynamics in the tip and the bulk of the wave .",
    "moreover , we found that , for the models analyzed , the time scale for the decay of higher order correlations , such as the genetic heterozygosity , is much longer than the time the population wave needs to equilibrate at a given speed or population size .",
    "the presence of such a time scale separation simplifies the analysis of coalescence times considerably .",
    "the ensemble of the resulting tuned models is complementary to established models of adaptation .",
    "while the latter have fixed population and fluctuating speeds of adaptation , the former has a fluctuating population size but fixed wave speeds .",
    "the resemblance of both ensembles relies on the fact that the fluctuations occur on time scales long compared to the relaxation time of the population wave .",
    "quantities that only depend on the mean logarithm of the population size , such as the wave speed or the coalescence time , thus agree asymptotically in both ensembles , see e.g.  fig .  [",
    "fig : popsizespeed ] , [ fig : fisherwaves ] .",
    "one might wonder about the net - effect of noise on models of adaptation and other traveling waves .",
    "if one is only concerned with the mean , many previous works have assumed that the effect of noise can be summarized by an effective cutoff in the tip of the wave  @xcite .",
    "this cutoff effect can be explicitly seen in the closed first moment equation of tuned models , as was already pointed out in ref .",
    "however , what is the effect of noise on higher - order correlations ?",
    "our general formulation in eq .   of the @xmath63 moment exhibits , in general , two terms with different signs that are unexpected in a deterministic framework .",
    "one term tends to generate positive correlations between nearby individuals ( in fitness space ) .",
    "these correlations then dissipate over distances due to the term with negative sign .",
    "importantly , the correlation term becomes dominating in the tip of the wave due to its density dependence .",
    "the net - effect of fluctuations on the correlations emphasizes the complex nature of fluctuations , which only to the lowest order can be captured by a simple cutoff term in an effective liouville operator .",
    "the branching random walk contains a parameter @xmath249 , the variance in offspring numbers per generation , that effectively measures the strength of genetic drift .",
    "surprisingly , the noise - induced terms do not depend on this parameter @xmath249 .",
    "this means that the noise - induced terms are not small , in general , even if the parameter @xmath249 is small , such that a controlled small - noise perturbation analysis is not possible .",
    "this reinforces the observation that noise is a singular perturbation that fundamentally impacts the outcome of ecological and evolutionary processes .",
    "our method of model tuning is quite versatile as it applies to any branching random walk subject to a global constraint .",
    "this includes models that combine ecology and evolution  @xcite or epistatic models in which mutations are not simply additive but might interact  @xcite .",
    "however , for more complex scenarios of interest to evolutionary biologists , one would like to introduce additional non - linearities .",
    "for instance , sex and recombination is a quadratic non - linearity as it depends on the the probability density of two different individuals finding each other and mating  @xcite . in evolutionary game theory ,",
    "one is interested in mutants that have a frequency - dependent advantage  @xcite .",
    "the fitness of producers of a common good depends on the frequency of producers .",
    "this , again , introduces a non - linearity , which is quadratic in the simplest case .",
    "such non - linearities can not be included in an exact way because they generate higher - order terms .",
    "however , it may be a useful approach to build them in and truncate the moment hierarchy at an appropriate order provided one can show that the neglected terms really are small .",
    "we believe that such reasoning should work , typically , if the non - linearities do not strongly influence the dynamics in the small density regions where the noise strength is large",
    ". a truncation scheme would , in this case , amount to matching a stochastic but linear description of the wave tip with a deterministic but non - linear bulk of the wave .",

    "<S> the dynamics of adaptation is difficult to predict because it is highly stochastic even in large populations . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty emerges from number fluctuations , called genetic drift , arising in the small number of particularly fit individuals of the population . </S>",
    "<S> random genetic drift in this evolutionary vanguard also limits the speed of adaptation , which diverges in deterministic models that ignore these chance effects . </S>",
    "<S> several approaches have been developed to analyze the crucial role of noise on the _ expected _ dynamics of adaptation , including the mean fitness of the entire population , or the fate of newly arising beneficial deleterious mutations . </S>",
    "<S> however , very little is known about how genetic drift causes fluctuations to emerge on the population level , including fitness distribution variations and speed variations . yet , these phenomena control the replicability of experimental evolution experiments and are key to a truly predictive understanding of evolutionary processes . here , we develop an exact approach to these emergent fluctuations by a combination of computational and analytical methods . we show , analytically , that the infinite hierarchy of moment equations can be closed at any arbitrary order by a suitable choice of a dynamical constraint . this constraint regulates ( rather than fixes ) the population size , accounting for resource limitations . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting linear equations , which can be accurately solved numerically , exhibit fluctuation - induced terms that amplify short - distance correlations and suppress long - distance ones . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , by accounting for the dynamics of sub - populations , we provide a systematic route to key population genetic quantities , such as fixation probabilities and decay rates of the genetic diversity . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , for some key quantities , asymptotic formulae can be derived . while it is natural to consider the process of adaptation as a branching random walk ( in fitness space ) subject to a constraint ( due to finite resources ) </S>",
    "<S> , we show that other noisy traveling waves likewise fall into this class of constrained branching random walks . </S>",
    "<S> our methods , therefore , provide a systematic approach towards analyzing fluctuations in a wide range of population biological processes , such as adaptation , genetic meltdown , species invasions or epidemics .    </S>",
    "<S> many important evolutionary and ecological processes rely on the behavior of a small number of individuals that have a large dynamical influence on the population as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> this is , perhaps , most obvious in the case of biological adaptation : future generations descend from a small number of currently well - adapted individuals . </S>",
    "<S> the genetic footprint of the large majority of the population is wiped out over time by the fixation of more fit genotypes . </S>",
    "<S> these dynamics can be visualized as a traveling wave in fitness space , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noisy - wave - schema]a . at any time , the currently most fit `` pioneer '' individuals reside in the small tip of the wave . as time elapses , the wave moves towards higher fitness and the formerly rare most fit individuals dominate the population . by that time </S>",
    "<S> , however , a new wave tip of even more fit mutants has formed and the cycle of transient dominance continues .    </S>",
    "<S> the principle of `` a few guiding the way for many '' also characterizes the motion of flocks of birds , which can be controlled by just a few leaders , or the expansion of an invasive species , which depends on pioneers most advanced into the virgin territory . </S>",
    "<S> the overall dynamics of these processes can become highly erratic even in large populations because the behavior of the entire population is influenced by strong number fluctuations , called genetic drift , occurring in the small subset of `` pioneer '' individuals .    </S>",
    "<S> such propagation processes with an extreme sensitivity of noise have also been called `` pulled '' waves , because they are pulled along by the action of the most advanced individuals  . if one ignores the fluctuations at the population level and is interested only in the expected dynamics of the population , one might be tempted to simply ignore genetic drift in models of pulled waves . </S>",
    "<S> however , it turns out that mean - field models ignoring genetic drift drastically overestimate the speed of traveling waves , to the point that they predict an ever accelerating rather than a finite speed of adaptation . </S>",
    "<S> it took 70 years since the first formulation of traveling wave models by fisher and kolomogorov , to realize that genetic drift influences both the expectation and the variation in singular ways  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ expected _ behavior of pulled waves has since been analyzed at great length . </S>",
    "<S> many results were first obtained for waves of invasion , noisy versions of the classical `` fkpp '' model by fisher , kolmogorov , petrovskii , piskunov  @xcite . in recent years , however , there has been a particularly strong research focus on models of adaptation . </S>",
    "<S> these models aroused widespread interest because they can be applied to several types of data , including genomic data derived from experimental evolution experiments and from natural populations that undergo rampant adaptation , such as bacteria and viruses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now have analytical predictions for a number of valuable analytical or semi - analytical results for observables such as the mean speed , probability of fixation , distribution of fixed mutations in the asymptotic regime of large populations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the great value of these results is that they show and rationalize which parameter combination chiefly influence the dynamics , and through which functional form . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , it has been generally found that the overall dynamics depends logarithmically on population size and mutation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the weak functional dependence is in fact at the root of universality observed in many such wave models : these predictions are independent of the precise details of the models , including the form of the non - linear population size regulation .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic challenge in analyzing noisy traveling arise from an essential non - linearity that is required to control population growth . </S>",
    "<S> ignoring such a dynamical control of the population size leads to long - term exponential growth or population extinction . </S>",
    "<S> progress in describing the _ mean _ behavior of front - sensitive models has been achieved by at least three different approaches : one can either heuristically improve the mean - field dynamics by setting the net growth rate equal to zero in regions where the population densities are too small  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an ad - hoc approach , based on a growth rate cut - off , correctly reproduces the wave speed to the leading order but does not reveal other universal next - to - leading order corrections or the wave diffusion constant . </S>",
    "<S> one can also invoke a branching - process approximation for the tip of the wave , thereby neglecting effects of the non - linear population size control , and then match this linearized description with a deterministic description of the bulk of the population  @xcite . finally , there is also the possibility to invoke a particular dynamical constraint with the property that the dynamics exhibits a closed linear equation for the first moment . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this method , which has been called `` model tuning ''  @xcite , reproduces the universal features of noisy traveling waves , which are independent of the chosen population control , ultimately because of the weakness of the population size dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> while understanding the mean behavior of noisy traveling waves has been an important achievement , the actual stochastic dynamics is characterized by pronounced fluctuations at the population level . </S>",
    "<S> no two realizations of an evolution experiment , for instance , will exhibit the same time - dependent fitness distribution because of the chance effects involved in reproduction and mutations . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the mean behavior requires many replicates in which the entire environment is accurately reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> even if one has access to many replicates , as is possible in highly parallelized well - mixed evolution experiments , one can potentially learn a lot from the variability between replicates . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a predictive understanding of the variability in evolutionary trajectories would greatly improve our quantitative understanding of how evolution works .    </S>",
    "<S> some exact results on fluctuations at the population level are available for a special model of fkpp waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , we currently lack a systematic approach that can be applied to a wide range of models . here </S>",
    "<S> , we fill this gap by extending the method of `` model tuning ''  @xcite to the analysis of higher correlation functions : we show that it is possible to choose a constraint in such a way that the hierarchy of moments is closed at any desired level . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting linear equations can be solved numerically and are amenable to asymptotic analytical techniques . as an important application of this approach , we show how the coalescence time can be computed within traveling wave models .    </S>",
    "<S> although our main results are applicable to a wide range of models , we focus our attention on simple models of adaptation . beyond simply grounding our discussion , there are two reasons to focus on these models . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> models of adaptation are simply important and have become an indispensable tool as a null model for evolutionary dynamics in microbial population . on the other hand , models of adaptation </S>",
    "<S> manifestly exhibit a particular mathematical structure , which we call _ constrained branching random walks_. as we will argue below , this mathematical structure , to which all our formal results apply , can be identified as the essence of a wide range of models arising in physics , ecology and evolution . </S>"
