    "the collision of two black holes is one of the most promising sources for gravitational radiation which the gravitational observatory ligo will be trying to detect @xcite .",
    "the detection of gravitational waves is a remarkable project which present challenges in all of their facets , most of them related to the fact that the signal generated from the merging of two black holes will arrive to us as a very tiny ripple in spacetime .",
    "although this is fortunate in the sense that we would not want to have great spacetime disturbances passing all around us , the fact that the signal is so feeble makes essential to the project to be able to theoretically predict and describe with a great deal of accuracy the gravitational wave generated during the process .",
    "the problem of two interacting black holes can be split into three stages , namely : the newtonian or far limit when they are already interacting gravitationally , but so far from each other that the dynamics can be studied within the newtonian description .",
    "then , as they get closer , the spacetime begins to be modified and no simplifying assumptions can be used anymore .",
    "it is supposed that the gravitational distortions will increase .",
    "this period of the evolution is known among the community as the `` full 3d '' part , meaning that the complete einstein equations have to be evolved .",
    "finally , in the last stage the two black holes are suppose to merge .",
    "after merging , the resulting black hole is supposed to wiggle and giggle , eventually settling down to a stationary black hole .",
    "this last part of the process is known as the close limit @xcite , and its importance resides in the fact that it can be described as a single perturbed black hole . in this case",
    "the evolution can be carried out using linearized perturbation theory . for a distorted schwarzschild or kerr black hole",
    ", the corresponding equations can be cast in a wave - like equation for unconstrained and gauge invariant scalar quantities , and the evolution is much more economic , numerically speaking , than the full 3d evolution .    to solve any system of evolution equations one needs initial data . in general relativity ( and gauge theories in general ) , the initial data can not be given freely but has to satisfy some constraint equations .",
    "there is a wide literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) on how to solve the constraint equations of general relativity .",
    "most approaches are based on the york - lichnerowicz decomposition @xcite in which case the constraint equations are recast in a set of four coupled elliptic equations .",
    "these equations simplify considerably if one considers conformally flat initial data , and several interesting solutions which describe a slice with two black holes ( see @xcite for a review ) have been found in this context .",
    "however , solutions with conformally flat three - metric suffer from the fact that they can not exactly represent kerr black holes since the kerr metric is not known to possess a conformally flat space part in the line element , due to the dragging ( for a perturbative proof of nonexistence , see @xcite . )",
    "therefore , this data is likely to contain `` junk '' radiation which , at least when the two black holes are very far from each other or have merged and settled down to a stationary black hole , might not reflect a realistic astrophysical scenario .",
    "more recent proposals relax the requirement for the initial data to be conformally flat @xcite and result in new constructions that are able to naturally incorporate spinning black holes .    in the present work",
    ", we construct initial data following an approach introduced by bishop _",
    "_ @xcite and further elaborated in @xcite which is not directly based on the york - lichnerowicz decomposition .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that one can easily obtain closed analytic expressions for the solution to the constraint equations in some limiting cases , including the close limit approximation .",
    "the approach , which is briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec - ks ] , uses a kerr - schild type of metric in order to construct the initial data . while in @xcite the superposition of two schwarzschild black holes",
    "is discussed , we generalize their proposal to spinning black holes in sec . [ sec - super ] .",
    "our superposition has some appealing features ( described in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec - super ] ) : i ) far limit : when the two black holes are infinitely far from each other , one obtains in the region near each one of them , initial data describing a single kerr black hole .",
    "ii ) close limit : when the black holes `` sit on the top of each other '' , one obtains again a single kerr black hole .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - kks ] we consider the close limit regime in which two rotating holes are close to each other with their singularities enclosed by a common apparent horizon . in this case",
    ", the initial slice can be viewed as a distorted @xmath0 kerr slice in kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "we explicitly solve the linearized constraint equations for the case in which the angular momenta of the two holes are opposite but equal in magnitude .",
    "using a generalized version @xcite of the zerilli and regge - wheeler equations , we evolve our initial data in sec .",
    "[ sec - num ] and compute the radiated energy .",
    "in particular , we discuss the dependence of the energy on the angular momenta of the holes and compare our results to other calculations based on bowen - york data @xcite .",

    "is given for how to solve the nonlinear constraint equations for the superposition of two non - spinning black holes .",
    "in the close limit approximation ( i.e. in the limit where the distance between the two black holes is much smaller than the mass of the holes ) the constraint equations can even be solved analytically @xcite .",
    "below , we first generalize bishop _",
    "s ansatz for @xmath8 to include the superposition of spinning black holes .",
    "then , we solve the constraint equations in the close limit approximation . for simplicity , we will only consider the case where the angular momentum of the two black holes are opposite but equal in magnitude . in this case , one obtains a perturbed schwarzschild black hole which is easier to study than a perturbed kerr black hole .",
    "in cartesian kerr - schild coordinates , the kerr spacetime can be written in the form ( [ eq : ks1 ] ) with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a positive function with units of distance given by @xmath18 here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the adm mass and the rotational parameter , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath17 is well - defined outside the disc @xmath21 , @xmath22 , whose boundary is the ring singularity .    in order to generalize bishop _",

    ", the vector @xmath28 can be written as the gradient of a potential function , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a normalization function , and @xmath31 now , the vector @xmath32 , which vanishes in the non - spinning case , can be written as the cross product of @xmath28 , that is , of @xmath33 ( with the same normalization function ) , and a vector proportional to the angular momentum of the black hole : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "if we allow @xmath36 to have components in arbitrary directions and replace @xmath37 by @xmath38 in the expressions ( [ eq : defv ] ) and ( [ eq : defr ] ) , we obtain the kerr solution for general angular momentum @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the spatial part of the covector @xmath5 can be written as @xmath40 where the potential @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 where now @xmath44 using the linearity of the @xmath45 operator , we have the necessary basis to propose the following ansatz for the spatial part of the null vector , that is , for the description of a cauchy slice with characteristics that allow a description of two black holes .",
    "let the black holes have masses @xmath46 , and angular momenta @xmath47 , @xmath48 , respectively and their centers be at the points @xmath49 , for black hole one , and at @xmath50 , for black hole two . having written a single kerr black hole in the form ( [ eq : lif ] ) , it is not difficult to generalize bishop _",
    "s proposal : we propose @xmath51 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the `` distance '' between the black hole s centers , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is an interaction function between the angular momenta of each black hole",
    ". its specific form can be left undetermined for the moment , as for the present analysis it is enough that it is a smooth function which behaves in the following way : @xmath56 there are several well known functions with this type of behavior .",
    "the specific form of @xmath57 might be related with the spin - spin interactions of particle physics , and will be analyzed in future works .",
    "the final rotational parameter @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 which corresponds to the vector addition of the angular momenta , @xmath60 .",
    "we will see shortly that eq .",
    "( [ eq : af ] ) is a necessary condition for obtaining the correct close limit .    finally , we comment on the fact that our ansatz has potential problems at points where @xmath61 vanishes ( such that @xmath26 can not be normalized at these points ) . for the superposition of two schwarzschild black holes ,",
    "there is exactly one such point . for two kerr black holes with @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    ", we found that @xmath64 is singular at @xmath65 , where the two holes are centered at @xmath49 , @xmath66 .",
    "in the situation studied in the next section we will see that this singularity does not cause any problems since there , we can excise a region which contains the ring singularities of the two holes and the above singularity .",
    "besides its mathematical simple form , the above ansatz has the following useful limits :    1 .",
    "far limit : let us consider that the center of the black hole 1 is at the origin , and that the center of the other is far from the origin , that is , @xmath67 goes to infinity . since then @xmath68",
    ", we obtain from eq.([eq : ai ] ) that @xmath69 .",
    "so from equation eq.([eq : ri ] ) , we see that each @xmath70 depends only on the parameters of the respective black hole .",
    "furthermore , in the vicinity of black hole 1 , @xmath71 is very large compared to @xmath72 so the second terms in eqs.([eq : phitwo],[eq : btwo ] ) can be dropped and one obtains the @xmath8 for one black hole with mass @xmath73 and angular momentum @xmath47 .",
    "close limit : suppose that @xmath74 , i.e. the limiting case when the distance @xmath75 between the two holes goes to zero .",

    "taking into account the expression for the final angular momentum , eq.([eq : af ] ) , the potential @xmath41 , and the vector @xmath79 , eqs.([eq : phitwo],[eq : btwo ] ) , we see that one obtains one black hole with center at @xmath49 , mass @xmath80 , and angular momentum @xmath81 .",
    "one hole limit : if the mass of one black hole , say @xmath82 , vanishes , it can be seen from eq.([eq : af ] ) that @xmath83 thus , from eq.([eq : ai ] ) , @xmath84 .",
    "thus the function @xmath72 only depends on @xmath85 and the potential @xmath41 , and the vector @xmath79 , eqs.([eq : phitwo],[eq : btwo ] ) , reduce to the expressions corresponding to black hole 1 .",
    "schwarzschild limit : finally , our ansatz reduces to the one given by bishop _",
    "_ in the non - spinning case @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we consider that we are presenting an educated ansatz for initial data with certain attractive properties describing the null vector on a space - like slice with two rotating black holes . in order to complete the initial data",

    "( [ eq : af ] ) ) , thus to zeroth order in @xmath92 , we have a schwarzschild black hole .    using this and the taylor expansion @xmath98 for the `` spin  spin interaction '' function , we eventually arrive at the following expansions for @xmath41 and @xmath79 @xmath99\\epsilon^2 + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^3 ) , \\label{eq : phiexp}\\\\ \\vec{b } & = & -\\frac{m\\,m_1\\,m_2}{r^3}\\,q\\,\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{e}\\,\\epsilon^2 + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^3 ) , \\label{eq : bexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the total mass , and where we have introduced @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 . here , @xmath104 is proportional to the dimensionless angular momentum parameter @xmath96 introduced above .",

    "one of the advantages of having a strongly hyperbolic system is that there is a well - defined way how to give boundary conditions ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath231 and @xmath243 are characteristic modes with characteristic speeds @xmath244 and @xmath245 , respectively . inside the horizon ( @xmath246 ) , both speeds are positive which means that all modes leave the domain if we put the inner boundary inside the horizon .",

    "we have made an ansatz to give initial data representing the superposition of two kerr black holes .",
    "the ansatz depends on the parameters @xmath212 ( masses ) , @xmath213 ( angular momentum ) , and an ( unphysical ) distance @xmath75 between the two black holes .",
    "the ansatz is such that when @xmath75 goes to infinity , one obtains two kerr black holes in kerr - schild coordinates with masses @xmath212 and angular momentum @xmath213 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath105 , one obtains one kerr black hole in kerr - schild coordinates with parameters @xmath100 , and @xmath214 .",

    "a proposal for two boosted non - spinning black holes which is along the lines of this article would be to take @xmath218 where @xmath219 are defined in a similar way as the @xmath220 above . whether or not this can easily be generalized to spinning black holes remains an open question .",
    "for the case of two un - boosted kerr black holes which have opposite angular momentum but which are equal in magnitude , we explicitly solved the constraint equations in the limit in which the black holes are close to each other . when solving the constraint equations , integration constants appear .",
    "these are associated with a deformation and a differential rotation of the apparent horizon .",
    "although we have a geometrical picture for them , we do not know which values these constants will take in an astrophysical realistic collapse .",
    "it should be stressed that this is a generic problem of close limit calculations since realistic data can only be provided once the full 3d part of a black hole collision is solved .",
    "fixing the integration constant to some specific value , we evolved the resulting distorted schwarzschild black hole using the generalized zerilli and rw equations in arbitrary coordinates and computed the radiated energy",
    ". our result might change if the constants are chosen differently , but nevertheless , when compared to results with a different choice of initial slice , we found a qualitatively similar behavior of the radiated energy as a function of the angular momentum of the black holes . in particular , we confirmed that there is more energy radiated when the angular momentum of the black holes are parallel to the approaching axis .    a similar analysis to the one presented here , but for the far limit case , is already underway and will be helpful in giving us a clearer physical understanding of the parameters appearing in our initial data , in particular in view of post - newtonian calculations .",
    "also , the physical meaning of our initial data in the intermediate region remains to be understood .",
    "finally , we plan to repeat our results using a version of the teukolsky equation in horizon penetrating coordinates @xcite,@xcite in order to test the latter and in order to proceed with more confidence to the case where the final black hole is a rotating one .",
