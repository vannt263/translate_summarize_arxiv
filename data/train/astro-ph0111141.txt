    "theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution have pointed out that differences between gas content and gas supply are a key factor in explaining differences between different galaxies ( e.g.  kauffman 1996 ) . at the same time , , fir and co observations of elliptical galaxies have demonstrated that many of these objects have an active and interesting cold interstellar medium , often qualitatively similar to that observed in spirals , although usually ( but not always ) in much smaller quantity ( see knapp 1998 for a review ) .",
    "the limits in sensitivity of the available instruments is still the main limitation for studying the cold ism in elliptical galaxies in a detailed an unbiased way .",
    "it is widely believed that when neutral hydrogen is observed in an elliptical galaxy it is the result of a recent accretion of a gas - rich companion galaxy .",
    "indeed , gas - rich elliptical galaxies are often classified as ` peculiar ' .",
    "this implies that by studying such galaxies one is considering only a subset of the whole population of early - type galaxies , namely those for which it is likely that some interaction / accretion has occurred .",
    "but when investigating the evolution of the whole group of early - type galaxies , it could be important not to restrict samples to ` pure ' ellipticals with no optical peculiarities , since gas - rich systems may represent an important phase in the evolution of many early - type galaxies and give us important information on the formation and evolution of these systems . at high redshift , similar processes will have been more common .",
    "the correlation between optical ` peculiarities ' and increased probability of finding  can be interpreted ( van gorkom & schiminovich 1997 ) either as an effect of the _ evolutionary stage _ of these galaxies ( accretion of  is a normal phase in the evolution of these galaxies ) or as an effect of _ environment _ ( the fraction of peculiar ellipticals in the revised shapley - ames catalogue goes from 5% in clusters to almost 50% in the field ) or ( perhaps more likely ) as a combination of the two . if the accretion of gas is a normal event in the evolution of many or most early - type galaxies , this raises questions like how much of the observed ism is due to small accretion events and to what extent parallels with spiral galaxies exist , whether in major mergers a significant fraction of the gas remains and , if so , how long does the ism survive and will it settle in a disk - like structure .",
    "recently , there have been several studies of major mergers ( i.e.  mergers of two disk galaxies ) and the fate of gas in these systems ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ; hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "these studies have shown the importance of the late infall of gas , possibly leading to extended , long  lived gas ",
    "rich structures in elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed , an increasing number of early - type galaxies are known that have a surprisingly large amount of  distributed in quite _ regular _ structures ( i.e.  disks or rings , e.g. , in ic 2006 , ngc 4278 , ngc 2974 , ngc  5266 , ic 5063 ) .",
    "the regular structure of these disks and rings means that they are relatively old , indicating that some early  type galaxies have a long - lived ism . in such galaxies ,",
    "the cold ism is not a ` peculiarity ' , but a fundamental constituent .",
    "apart from the origin and evolution of the neutral hydrogen in early - type systems , studying  in these objects and in particular in dust ",
    "lane ellipticals , may give accurate estimates of the mass distribution at large radii in these galaxies .",
    "bertola et al .",
    "( 1993 ) combined @xmath8 values derived from   data with estimates for the central @xmath8 ( based on optical measurements from ionized gas disks ) to show evidence for an increasing @xmath8 with radius , supporting the idea of a dark halo around ellipticals .",
    "however estimates of @xmath8 from  data are only available for a handful of well  studied ellipticals ( e.g.  ic  2006 , franx et al .   1994 ; ngc  1052 , van gorkom et al .",

    "1981 and lees 1994 ; ngc  5266 , morganti et al .  1997 ) .",
    "it is important to increase the number of galaxies for which a similar analysis using  data can be done .",
    "this requires not only finding ellipticals with , but finding those in which the   has settled into a regular disk . for dust - lane ellipticals , regular large - scale dust could indicate the presence of a regular disk and this is particularly valuable if we want to determine the intrinsic shape of the galaxy and the mass  to  light ratio ( @xmath8 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present new observations of neutral hydrogen in dust ",
    "lane elliptical galaxies .",
    "the presence of dust lanes is often considered a ` peculiarity ' in an elliptical galaxy . thus , for the reasons mentioned above , dust ",
    "lane ellipticals are good targets in which to search for neutral hydrogen .",
    "systematic optical searches for dust in elliptical galaxies ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ; van dokkum & franx 1995 ) have found dust lanes and patches in the inner regions of about 50% of the observed galaxies .",

    "2001 ) ; either in filamentary form , nuclear disks or more large scale disks . in this paper",
    "we study five galaxies with large - scale dust lanes ( centaurus  a - like ) , mainly taken from the compilation of sadler & gerhard ( 1985 ) : ngc  1947 , ngc  3108 , eso  263g48 , ngc  7049 , ngc  7070a .",
    "table  1 summarizes the main properties of these five galaxies .",

    "all five galaxies were first observed with the most compact configuration available with the atca ( 375 m array ) . the two detected galaxies ( ngc  1947 and ngc  3108 , see below )",
    "were then observed with other atca configurations to image the emission in more detail .",
    "table  2 summarizes the  observations .",
    "we used a 16 mhz band with 512 velocity channels centred on the optical velocity of each galaxy . the final velocity resolution ( after hanning smoothing the data ) is @xmath312 km s@xmath10 .",
    "we observed each galaxy for about 12 hours in each run ( with the exception of ngc  7070a ) , with calibrators observed every hour to monitor gain and phase changes .",
    "the flux density scale was set by observations of pks 1934638 , for which we adopted a flux density of 14.9 jy at 1400 mhz .",
    "this source was also used as bandpass calibrator .",
    "the spectral data were calibrated with the miriad package ( sault et al.1995 ) , which has several features particularly suited for atca data .",
    "the continuum subtraction was also done in miriad , by using a linear fit through the line  free channels of each visibility record and subtracting this fit from all the frequency channels ( i.e.   uvlin ) .",
    "an interference spike generated by the atca data acquisition system is present at 1408  mhz , but this does not compromise the interpretation of the data .    for the objects which were observed with more than one atca configuration , we combined the data from different runs after calibration and continuum subtraction .",
    "the final cubes were made with natural , uniform or robust ",
    "briggs weighting .",
    "table  3 lists the corresponding rms noise and size of the restoring beams .",
    "the moment analysis of the data cube was done using gipsy ( allen , ekers & terlouw 1985 ) .",
    "the total intensity of the  emission were derived from a data cube produced by smoothing spatially the original cube to a resolution about twice lower than the original .",
    "this smoothed cube was used as mask for the original cube : pixels with signal below @xmath11 in the smoothed cube were set to zero in the original cube ( van gorkom & ekers 1989 ) .    was not detected in three of the target galaxies , and for these galaxies the upper limits on   emission were calculated as three times the statistical error on having no signal over 50 independent velocity elements ( corresponding to 600 km / s ) and over four synthesised beams .",
    "the continuum data were taken from the emission - free channels in the line data .",
    "they were also reduced using miriad , and table  4 summarizes the results .",

    "the velocity increases rapidly in the inner part ( @xmath26 arcsec ) with a ` discontinuity ' observed in the centre , but the projected velocity appears to decrease in the outer parts .",
    "the observed morphology of the dust lanes suggests that the  might also lie in three or more concentric rings .",
    "this may explain the ` discontinuity ' seen near the systemic velocity .",
    "the combination of a number of rings , together with the fact that the spatial resolution of the  data is relatively low , can reproduce the distribution of the   in the position - velocity plot .",

    "the   is distributed in a regularly rotating disk with a slight warp .",
    "if we assume circular orbits and a spherical mass distribution , we find @xmath50 to be @xmath314 @xmath82 at about 5.4 @xmath4 .    in ngc  5128 , the neutral hydrogen appears to be largely associated with the dust lane ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1990 ) . in the inner part",
    "the  velocities match the optical emission - line velocities while in the outer parts the gas disk seems to be not settled yet into stable orbits .",
    "recently ,  emission has also been detected further out in this galaxy , at distances up to 15kpc from the nucleus ( schiminovich et al .",
    "this outer  appears to be in a partial ring inclined respect to the dust lane , rotating in the same sense as the main body of the galaxy .",
    "ngc  1052 is classified as an e3 galaxy with a minor  axis dust lane .",
    "was first detected by knapp et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , and its distribution has been studied in detail by van gorkom et al .",
    "they found the  distributed over about three times the size of the optical galaxy and roughly perpendicular to the major axis ( i.e.  roughly aligned with the dust lane ) .",
    "the distribution of the  is not very regular especially in the outer regions where tidal tails are observed .",
    "the ionized gas detected in this galaxy is distributed roughly in a disk that may not be filled ( davies & illingworth 1986 ) . a more detailed study (",
    "plana & boulesteix 1996 ) has shown that two counter - rotating gaseous components are actually present with an apparent major axis nearly perpendicular to the stellar one , i.e.  similar to the position angle of the neutral hydrogen .",
    "in particular , one of the components has kinematics similar to the .",
    "ngc 5363 is another early - type galaxy with dust lanes in which hi has been detected ( e.g.  thuan & wadiak 1982 ) .",
    "however , only single - dish data are available and little is known about the distribution an dkinematics of the .",
    "we have detected and imaged the neutral hydrogen in two of the five dust ",
    "lane early - type galaxies observed and are able to put sensitive upper limits on the  content of the remaining three galaxies .",
    "an interesting result is the large amount of  in one of the objects , ngc  3108 . with @xmath41 @xmath1  of neutral hydrogen ,",
    "ngc  3108 has a value of @xmath83 which is at the gas - rich end of the distribution characteristic of ellipticals ( knapp et al .  1985 ) and is similar to that found in many luminous spiral galaxies .",
    "the  in ngc 3108 is distributed in a very regular disk that is quite large ( @xmath340 kpc radius ) , and appears to be only slightly warped .",
    "the  disk appears to have a central hole that is filled by a disk of diffuse emission from ionized gas .",
    "the average  surface density ( 0.5 - 1 @xmath1  pc@xmath27 ) is too low for large - scale star formation .    the other galaxy ( ngc  1947 ) where  is detected is less gas  rich with @xmath84 , which is a more typical value for those elliptical galaxies that are detected in . as in ngc 3108 ,",
    "the  in ngc 1947 extends to several effective radii and appears to be a disk that , in contrast to the disk in ngc 3108 , is strongly warped .",
    "the fact that we do not detect the other three galaxies in  means that there is a large range in ism properties in dust - lane ellipticals , as there is for early - type galaxies in general .",
    "this is the case for the  content , but also in the relative content of different indicators of a cold ism .",
    "the upper limits for @xmath85 for the non - detections are quite strict , considering that typical values for this ratio ( and as observed in ngc 1947 and ngc 3108 ) are between a few hundred to a few thousand , although a few more galaxies with very low values exist ( henkel & wiklind , 1997 ) .",
    "it is quite unlikely that @xmath85 is so low due to most of the  being ionized , since such large amounts of ionized gas would be detected easily .",
    "a possibility would be that much of the gas in these galaxies is in molecular ( h@xmath14 ) rather than atomic form .",
    "an example of such a galaxy is ngc 759 where @xmath86 @xmath1 of dust is detected ( wiklind et al .",
    "1997 ) while a 5-@xmath51 upper limit of @xmath87 @xmath1 exists for the amount of  in this galaxy ( oosterloo , morganti & wiklind , in prep . ) .",
    "this means that for ngc 759 @xmath88 .",
    "however , @xmath89 @xmath1 of molecular hydrogen is detected in this galaxy ( wiklind et al .",
    "this means that @xmath90 , not outside the normal range of values for this ratio ( henkel & wiklind , 1997 ) .",
    "it also means that all the cold gas in ngc 759 is in molecular form .",
    "the molecular hydrogen is found to be very centrally concentrated in ngc 759 ( wiklind et al .",
    "perhaps that in ngc 759 the atomic gas , that is normally more extended than the molecular gas , has been removed by interactions with neighbouring galaxies , leaving ngc 759 poor in , but not poor in molecular gas .",
    "ngc 759 is indeed in a denser environment that that of galaxies like ngc 3108 or ngc 5266 .",
    "little data on the molecular gas content of these galaxies is available , although the work of lees et al .  (",
    "1991 ) suggests that the molecular gas mass is typically similar to the  mass , although also here a large scatter exist . as noted in table 1 , ngc  1947",
    "has been detected in co ( sage & galletta 1993 ) with an implied h@xmath14 mass of @xmath91 @xmath1 , which is slightly higher than our measured  mass .",
    "clearly , we need more sensitive co observations of these galaxies to clarify the state of their ism .",
    "the 158@xmath92 m line of [ cii ] detected by iso ( e.g.  malhotra et al .",
    "1999 ) has the potential to provide an independent and very sensitive probe of the cool ism in early  type galaxies , but only a few observations are available so far .",
    "it is generally assumed that the neutral hydrogen in ellipticals is related to a recent merger- or accretion event . in most numerical simulations of merging galaxies of similar size",
    ", most of the gas quickly falls towards the centre where it fuels a burst of star formation .",
    "the large , regular  structures seen in some of the galaxies discussed here ( in particular the very regular disk in ngc 3108 ) , the fact that in some galaxies these disks exist from the very centre out to radii of several tens of kpc , and the large amount of present in a few galaxies , may seem incompatible with this . perhaps if the  disks are not formed in a merger of similarly sized galaxies , but instead are the result of several smaller accretions that , since such accretions are less `` violent '' , can lead to the formation of a large , regular disk in a way that is to some extent similar to how disks in spiral galaxies form .",
    "the difference would then be that the surface density in the gas disks in the early - type galaxies is too low for a significant optical disk to form . in a way , they could be `` disk - less disk galaxies '' , or perhaps parallels exist with low surface brightness spiral galaxies .",
    "an alternative is that for a relatively uncommon set of initial conditions of a major merger , a large fraction of the gas forms large gas disk .",
    "one of the main arguments found in the literature for a merger related origin is that the amount of  is uncorrelated with the optical luminosity of the galaxy , in contrast to the situation for spiral galaxies ( e.g. knapp et al.1985 , roberts & haynes 1994 ) . in the dust ",
    "lane ellipticals discussed here , there is indeed a large scatter in relative  content , ranging from rich objects like ngc 5266 ( with @xmath93 ) to very poor galaxies like eso 263g48 ( @xmath59 ) and ngc 7049 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "there also seems to be a large range in the conditions of the ism , considering the large range in relative amounts of different constituents of the cold ism .",
    "optical data suggest that in several of the galaxies discussed here a significant accretion event must have taken place and that the disk is not a result of a slower buildup .",
    "ngc 5266 has a very low - surface brightness , extended and irregularly shaped optical counterpart to the large - scale   disk that only shows up at large radius after special data processing techniques ( see fig .  5 in morganti et al .",
    "1997 ) . in ic 5063 , a deep image ( danziger et al .  1981 ) shows a similar faint , irregular large - scale optical structure with some indications of optical shells . in ngc",
    "5128 optical shells are seen at large radius and an association of these shells with the  at large radius has been suggested ( schiminovich et al .",
    "the morphology of these very faint optical counterparts to the outer  disks indicates that they are structures that are not settled yet and may have formed from stellar material from the progenitors that also provided the .",
    "numerical studies show that a large fraction of the tidal tails formed during the interaction and merger will remain bound to the remnant ( barnes & hernquist 1996 and references therein )",
    ". this gas will slowly ` fall back ' to the main body of the galaxy over a long period of time .",
    "for the galaxy ngc 7252 , hibbard & mihos ( 1995 ) predict that about @xmath95 of  will return within 15 - 45 kpc in about 3 gyr , if the gas structures at large radius are not disrupted by companions in the mean time .",
    "not all of this gas may not fall into the centre .",
    "instead , it may form an extended , low surface  density disk . in a crowded environment , this infall can be disrupted and a disk will not form .",
    "the regular kinematics of most of the , but the tail - like features at large radius in ngc 5266 would suggest that this galaxy represents an intermediately evolved result of such a major merger .",
    "ic 5063 , with a more regular  distribution , could represent an even older merger remnant .",
    "the very regular appearance of the disk in ngc 3108 , combined with the fact that it goes from centre out to @xmath96 kpc , would mean that , if the disk in ngc 3108 is also due to a single event , it must be an even older merger remnant than ic 5063 .",
    "the outer isophotes of ngc 3108 are quite boxy , indicating a merger of some size has taken place .    given the rarity of merger remnants with such a large , regular  disk , the conditions that gave rise to such a remnants do no occur every often.nevertheless , it appears that the formation of large gas disks is a rare , but natural result of the way early - type galaxies form .    in ngc 1947 no extended low - surface brightness structure",
    "is seen in the optical ( d.  malin priv .",
    "the amount of gas in ngc 1947 and its lower @xmath19 may indicate that the  in this galaxy could result from a single ` small ' accretion , i.e.  an accretion with a mass ratio of more than a few .",
    "the surface densities of the  in most of the galaxies are quite low . for ngc 3108",
    "we find that it must be in the range 0.5 - 1 @xmath1  pc@xmath27 over most of the disk . for ngc 1947",
    "we find that the average surface density is 0.3 @xmath1  pc@xmath27 but the value for the central region is probably higher .",
    "these surface densities are quite low and , except for the central regions , no large - scale star formation will occur in these galaxies .",
    "not much evolution will happen in these disks at large radius . even though the galaxies discussed here are early - type galaxies , some of these galaxies will remain gas rich for a very long period of time and the gas should be considered a fundamental constituent of the galaxy .",
    "it is worth remarking on the difference between the morphology of the neutral hydrogen in _ luminous _ dust  lane ellipticals , like ngc 3108 and ngc 5266 , and in low ",
    "luminosity e / s0 galaxies . in the low  luminosity galaxies , regular disks of , extending out to a few effective radii , are very common ( lake et al .  1987 ; sadler et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , the  distribution is strongly peaked towards the centre , in contrast to what we see in the more luminous dust - lane ellipticals , and the central  surface densities in these low - luminosity galaxies are high enough for significant star formation to occur in their centres .",
    "several of the luminous dust - lane ellipticals considered here have ionized gas in the central region in the form of disks or rings that , in some cases like ngc 3108 are inner extensions of the neutral gas disks .",
    "the optical spectra of these central ionized gas disks ( with the exception of ic 5063 , which is a seyfert 2 galaxy ) are typically liner - like and not typical of star forming regions .",
    "the ionization mechanism of gas in liners is still unclear ( colina & koratkar 1997 ) , but is usually attributed either to shocks ( heckman 1980 , dopita & sutherland 1995 ) , old uv - bright post agb stars ( binette et al . 1994 ) hot high - metallicity o - type stars ( filippenko & terlevich 1992 ) or to thermal interaction with a hot ism ( e.g.   goudfrooij 1998 ) .",
    "whatever the mechanism , it appears that the conditions in luminous early - type galaxies , in contrast to less luminous early - type galaxies , are such that the hydrogen near the centre can not remain neutral but becomes ionized .",
    "some of the regular  structures can be used for studying the dark matter properties at large radii . in general",
    ", a complication is that it is often difficult to determine the inclination of the  disk in early - type galaxies ( e.g.  sadler et al .",
    "2000 ) . for dust ",
    "lane galaxies , however , the situation is more promising since the inclination of the   structures can be assumed to be close to edge  on and small uncertainties in the inclination angle do not have a large effect on the derived total mass . in ngc 3108",
    "the rotation curve is basically flat , as it is in luminous spirals .",
    "if we assume circular orbits and a spherical mass distribution , we derive a value of @xmath5 @xmath6 at 6 @xmath4 for ngc  3108 .",
    "this compares well with values of 1520 @xmath6 that are typically found in elliptical galaxies at radii of 6 - 7 @xmath4 using  data ( e.g.  morganti et al.1997 ; morganti et al .",
    "these numbers imply that significant amounts or dark matter are present at large radii in these galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to compare the mass  to  light ratio values derived from neutral hydrogen data with those obtained from x  ray observations , since very different tracers of the potential are used . from x  ray data , values of @xmath97 within 6 @xmath4 are usually found ( e.g.   loewenstein 1998 ) which converts to @xmath98 for the value of the hubble constant used by us in this paper .",
    "although both methods have their uncertainties , there appears to be good agreement between the   and x  ray estimates of the masses of early  type galaxies .",
    "we have presented new  observation of five dust  lane ellipticals . in two galaxies",
    "we detect  emission . in both galaxies",
    "the   is in a warped , disk - like structure , with ( in particular in ngc 3108 ) regular kinematics . for the remaining tree galaxies we derive sensitive upper limits that imply a very low  content compared to the dust mass .",
    "differences in merging history may perhaps explain the large range in the relative content of different tracers of the cold ism .    by adding data from the literature ,",
    "we find several dust - lane elliptical galaxies where the  is regularly distributed in disks / rings of several tens of kpc in size , and at least three dust - lane galaxies with more than @xmath95 of .",
    "the data collected suggests that most dust - lane galaxies probably represent the results of major mergers as seen at a late stage in their evolution . in these systems , the late infall of gas has produced regular , settled  disks . in some cases , the disk could also be the result of accretions of several small galaxies , spread out in time .",
    "the  surface density is quite low over most of these disks and little or no recent star formation has occurred ( except possibly in the very centre ) .",
    "these gas disks will evolve very slowly and the galaxies will remain gas rich for a very long period of time .",
    "the presence of large , regular  structures suggests that a significant fraction of elliptical galaxies may have a long  lived cool interstellar medium .",
    "the regular distribution and kinematics of the  in ngc 3108 allow us to derive the mass  to  light ratio in this galaxy .",
    "we find a value of @xmath99 @xmath100 at 6 @xmath101 .",
    "this value is very similar to what is found in other elliptical galaxies based on data .",
