    "the power - law temporal decays displayed by the radio , optical , and x - ray fluxes of grb afterglows ( @xmath8 ) have provided strong support for the prediction ( meszaros & rees 1997 ) that afterglows arise from the relativistic blast - wave generated as the grb outflow ejecta interacts with the ambient medium . if the grb outflow is a collimated jet then a break in the smooth power - law decay of the afterglow is expected for both either a conical jet ( panaitescu , meszaros & rees 1998 ) or a sideways - spreading jet ( by rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "the breaks found in the flux decay light curves of most of the well - sampled afterglows that were localized by the bepposax satellite seemed to provide solid observational support for the existence of these predicted jet - breaks ( e.g. frail et al 2001 ) .",
    "it was also realized early on that there should be a substantial diversity in the steepness of the afterglow flux decay , even when the spectral slope is constant , if the fundamental forward - shock parameters vary as the shock traverses the ambient medium .",
    "rees & meszaros ( 1998 ) derived the expected power - law flux decay for the forward - shock synchrotron flux in the case of an outflow whose kinetic energy - per - solid angle @xmath9 is not constant in time , either because the shock s energy increases due to fresh ejecta arriving at the blast - wave or because @xmath9 is anisotropic . two important microphysical parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , which quantify the fraction of the post - shock energy acquired by electrons and magnetic field , also determine the intensity the afterglow synchrotron flux , and their variability could also yield a variety of decay indices @xmath12 .",
    "swift measurements of grb x - ray afterglows provide support for that shock parameters vary .",
    "the standard forward - shock model with constant energy and shock micro - parameters predicts a closure relation between the temporal decay index @xmath12 and the slope @xmath13 of the x - ray continuum ( @xmath14 ) of the form @xmath15 .",
    "the early x - ray flux of some swift afterglows decays slower than expected for the measured spectral slope @xmath13 , which was attributed to a variable kinetic energy of the forward shock ( nousek et al 2006 , panaitescu et al 2006 , zhang et al 2006 ) . moreover , the flux decay indices @xmath12 displayed by swift x - ray afterglows after the slow decay phase are not correlated with the x - ray spectral slope @xmath13 ( panaitescu 2007 ) , as would be expected from the @xmath16 closure relation for the forward - shock emission .    when optical light - curves are taken into account , the standard jet model fares even worse , being inconsistent with practically all swift afterglows ( liang et al 2008 ) . while more than half of the well - sampled optical afterglows display coupled optical and x - ray light - curves ( panaitescu & vestrand 2011 ) , exhibiting similar flux decay indices and/or simultaneous light - curve breaks , many other afterglows show a decoupling of their optical and x - ray light - curves , with a light - curve break occurring only in the x - ray .",
    "at least four possibilities for this light - curve decoupling , which is not predicted by the standard jet model , have been proposed : @xmath17 ) the x - ray afterglow emission arises occasionally from the same not - yet - understood mechanism which produces the prompt burst emission ( ghisellini et al 2007 ) , @xmath18 ) there is a dominant contribution of the reverse - shock to the afterglow emission ( uhm & beloborodov 2007 ) , @xmath19 ) the forward - shock emission is reprocessed by bulk - scattering and/or inverse - compton scattering outside the forward - shock ( panaitescu 2008 ) , or @xmath20 ) the optical and x - ray afterglow flux arise from different parts of the forward - shock , from different jets ( e.g. racusin et al 2008 ) .    in this work , _ we assume that swift x - ray afterglows arise from the forward - shock _ , and attribute the failure of the standard jet model in accounting for the x - ray flux decay indices to the assumption that the forward shock energy is constant",
    ".    evolving micro - physical parameters ( e.g. ioka et al 2006 ) could , in principle , explain the measured x - ray flux decay indices , but the existence of light - curve breaks requires an unnatural , sudden change in their evolution .",
    "for that reason , we maintain in this work the basic assumption of the standard jet model that micro - physical parameters do not evolve .",
    "we also assume that the ambient medium with which the post - grb outflow interacts is uniform , without discontinuities that could yield breaks in the afterglow light - curve at a frequency .",
    "a notable model thus excluded is that where the afterglow - producing outflow interacts with a prior outflow ( ioka et al 2006 ) whose density increases radially outward up to its termination shock , yielding a slower decay of the afterglow flux than expected for a homogeneous ambient medium , followed by a break to a steeper decay .",
    "one reason for relaxing the constant shock energy constraint is the observational evidence for x - ray flares in swift afterglows ( e.g. chincarini et al 2007 ) .",
    "the short timescale of those flares indicates that the grb progenitor produces relativistic ejecta after the burst phase , whose arrival at the decelerating forward - shock could increase substantially the blast - wave s energy .",
    "our hypothesis is that such an injection of energy in the forward - shock is , in general , a more persistent and continuous process .",
    "however , we note that the fluence of x - ray flares is about 10 percent that of the burst ( falcone et al 2007 ) , hence the late outflow powering the flares could carry a dynamically - important energy only if that outflow is much less efficient than the grb outflow in producing x - ray emission .",
    "we derive in  [ anal ] the closure relations @xmath16 for a continuous energy injection in the forward - shock . for the ease of extracting from observations",
    "the required injected power history , we assume that the forward - shock energy increases as a power with observer - time , @xmath21 , which is motivated by that the resulting afterglow flux should be power - law in observer time . this assumption circumvents a calculation of the kinematics for the ejecta  forward - shock interaction .    in  [ swift ] , the closure relations for the forward - shock emission with energy injection are applied to a set of swift afterglows with well sampled light - curves .",
    "there , we examine two plausible scenarios for the origin of afterglow x - ray light - curve breaks ( break in energy injection , jet - break ) , three dynamical regimes of the forward - shock ( spherical expansion , conical jet , spreading jet ) , and two radiation processes that may yield the afterglow x - ray flux ( synchrotron , inverse - compton ) .",
    "there are three mechanisms that could produce a change in the flux power - law decay index @xmath12 , i.e. an afterglow light - curve break .",
    "\\(1 ) passage of a spectral break .",
    "x - ray light - curve breaks are , generally , not accompanied by a spectral evolution ( nousek et al 2006 ; liang , zhang & zhang 2007 ; willingale et al 2007 ) , hence their origin in the passage of the spectral feature is largely ruled out , but there are other reasons why such an x - ray light - curve break origin is unlikely .",
    "the slower evolution of the cooling frequency @xmath22 ( the synchrotron characteristic frequency at which radiate the electrons that cool radiatively on the hydrodynamical timescale ) leads to extended x - ray light - curve breaks when @xmath22 crosses the 0.3 - 10 kev band .",
    "the peak frequency @xmath23 of the @xmath24 synchrotron spectrum decreases faster , but it is likely to be lower than the x - rays even at early times , hence it can not cross the x - ray band during afterglow observations .",
    "\\(2 ) jet - break .",
    "a light - curve break occurs at the ` jet - break time ' , when the outflow lorentz factor @xmath25 drops below the inverse of the jet half - angle @xmath26 . for a ` conical jet ' that does not spread laterally ( as in the case of an outflow core embedded in an envelope that prevents the spreading of the core but yields a negligible emission ) ,",
    "the steepening of the x - ray flux decay is solely due to that , after the jet - break time , the average kinetic energy per solid angle @xmath9 over the visible cone of angle @xmath27 ( where relativistic doppler boost is effective ) is decreasing with observer - frame time . for a ` spreading jet ' ( as expected for a top - hat distribution of @xmath9 ) , in addition to the above - described geometrical - relativistic effect , there is a second contribution to the x - ray flux decay steepening from the enhanced jet deceleration produced by the jet lateral spreading .",
    "\\(3 ) energy injection break .",
    "if energy injection occurs routinely in grb afterglows , then a light - curve break could be produced by a change in the injected power .",
    "the dynamical behaviours of the forward - shock model to be considered are : @xmath17 ) a ` spherical ' outflow , i.e. a wide jet whose edge becomes visible to the observer after the last x - ray measurement ( at @xmath28 ) , which occurs if jet half - angle satisfies @xmath29 , and @xmath18 ) a narrow jet whose edge is already visible at the first x - ray observation ( at @xmath30 ) , occurring when @xmath31 . for the latter model , we will consider both a conical jet and a spreading jet .",
    "these dynamical models are applicable also to x - ray afterglows without light - curve breaks , in which case the energy injection law must be unevolving ( a single index @xmath32 ) .",
    "we will investigate the ability of the energy - injection break and jet - break models above to accommodate the observed x - ray flux decays before and after the break , with allowance for all three dynamical models ( spherical outflow , conical jet , spreading jet ) , for two types of ambient medium ( homogeneous and wind - like ) , two radiation mechanisms dominating the x - ray flux ( synchrotron and inverse - compton ) , and two possible locations of the x - ray relative to the cooling frequency @xmath22 but , first , a word about their rationale .",
    "wind - like media , having a @xmath33 particle density , are expected at 0.1 - 1 pc from the source of long grbs , i.e. where the @xmath34 afterglow emission is produced , because the progenitors of such bursts are massive wolf - rayet stars that drive powerful winds .",
    "the termination - shock of such winds is of several pcs ( garcia - segura et al 1996 ) , thus a homogeneous medium at the afterglow location seems unjustified .",
    "however , if the grb progenitor resides in a highly - pressurized bubble , the wind termination - shock radius could be as low as 0.5 pc ( chevalier et al 2004 ) , with a further reduction of that radius if the wr wind is weak , as expected along the rotation axis ( ramirez - ruiz et al 2005 ) , or if the wr star moves sufficiently fast relative to the ism ( van marle et al 2006 ) , thus the afterglow could occur in shocked wind , which is quasi - homogeneous .",
    "synchrotron emission is generally believed to produce all the afterglow emission , but the likelihood of inverse - compton emission being dominant is higher at higher photon frequency , like x - rays .",
    "admittedly , that requires a high environment density , perhaps ten times higher ( panaitescu 2011 ) than implied by the mass - loss rates and terminal wind velocities measured for galactic wolf - rayet winds ( nugis & lamers 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 closure relations expected for a given variant of the forward - shock model are derived from the evolution of the spectral characteristics @xmath35 ( peak flux ) , @xmath23 ( frequency of the @xmath36 spectrum peak ) , and @xmath22 ( cooling frequency ) , and from the shape of the @xmath37 spectrum at frequencies higher than its @xmath38 peak : @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the power - law index of the electron distribution with energy produced by the shock ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "therefore , the flux received at observing frequency @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 for @xmath42 and @xmath49 for @xmath44 ( @xmath40 implies an x - ray spectrum with @xmath50 that is harder than measured for nearly all swift x - ray afterglows ) .    for a spherical outflow ( or a jet before the jet - break time @xmath51 ) and for synchrotron emission , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "here @xmath55 is the mass of the ambient medium swept - up by the forward - shock ( i.e. the number of radiating electrons ) ; @xmath56 is the post - shock magnetic field , whose energy density @xmath57 is assumed to be a fraction @xmath11 of the post - shock energy density @xmath58 ( from the shock jump conditions ) ; @xmath59 is the external density at the shock s location ; @xmath60 is the typical electron random lorentz factor , parametrized as a fraction @xmath10 of the proton random lorentz factor @xmath61 ; and @xmath62^{-1}$ ] is the random lorentz factor of the electrons whose radiative cooling timescale equals the comoving - frame shock s age @xmath63 , @xmath64 being the outflow radius and @xmath65 the compton parameter .",
    "we assume the more likely situations of either electrons cooling mostly through synchrotron emission ( @xmath66 ) or , if inverse - compton is dominant ( @xmath67 ) , that @xmath68 , in which case @xmath69 is constant and does not affect the evolution of @xmath22 .    for a jet ( conical or spreading ) after the jet - break time and for _ synchrotron _ emission",
    ", we have @xmath70 , with @xmath23 and @xmath22 as above .",
    "thus @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73    the characteristics of the _ inverse - compton _ spectrum are immediately related with those of the synchrotron spectrum : @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the optical thickness to electron scattering of the shocked ambient medium ) , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , thus @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80      the above equations for the spectral characteristics show that their evolution and , thus , the resulting flux decay index @xmath12 , is set by the forward - shock dynamics : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the energy - per - particle behind that shock is @xmath84 , hence the lab - frame energy of the forward - shock is @xmath85 and its dynamics is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the kinetic energy of the ejecta ( all transferred to the forward - shock ) at the time @xmath88 when the assumed power - law energy injection ( @xmath21 ) begins .",
    "the other equations for the forward - shock dynamics are @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the density of the ambient medium at radius @xmath64 ( @xmath91 for a homogeneous medium , @xmath92 for a wind ) and @xmath93 the increase of the jet opening at the comoving - frame sound speed ( @xmath94 ) , and @xmath95 for the observer - frame arrival time @xmath96 of photons emitted along the direction toward the observer .",
    "defining @xmath97 , @xmath98 with @xmath99 ( the radius where the lateral spreading almost doubles the initial opening of an adiabatic jet interacting with a homogeneous medium ) , and @xmath100 , the above equations for the outflow dynamics become : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 equation ( [ dyn2 ] ) allows the conversion of the jet dynamics [ @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 from lab frame to observer frame [ @xmath108 , @xmath82 , @xmath109 .    for a spherical outflow , a conical jet , or a spreading jet before the jet - break time ,",

    "a more correct way of assessing the success of the jet - break model with steady energy injection is to say that it can explain at least one of the breaks observed for 85 afterglows out of 98 or , conversely , that it can not account for any of the x - ray light - curve breaks of 12 percent of afterglows . excluding the 30 breaks ( of 30 afterglows ) that can be accounted for with an adiabatic jet - break , the jet - break model with non - zero energy injection",

    "given that 12 percent of afterglows have an x - ray light - curve break that can not be explained with a jet - break even when a steady energy injection is allowed , and that some afterglows display two breaks , out of which only one can be a jet - break , it is natural to speculate that some x - ray light - curve breaks must arise from a change in the power at which energy is added to the forward - shock . in the extreme",

    "the only way for this model to fail is an x - ray flux that decays steeper than expected for an adiabatic shock , as energy injection can only mitigate the afterglow flux decay .",

    "both models yield _ achromatic _ light - curve breaks , appearing at the same time in all light - curves . for those afterglows where it can be established that the optical and x - ray emissions arise from the same source , either because the light - curve breaks are achromatic or because the optical and x - ray spectra are on the same power - law continuum , testing the light - curve break origin and determining the model details ( location of cooling frequency , ambient medium stratification , radiation process , outflow dynamics ) can be done by comparing the optical flux decay indices @xmath279 with the model expectations , for the energy injection parameter @xmath32 required by the x - ray flux decay indices @xmath248 .    in grblog database of optical light - curves ( quimby , mcmahon & jeremy 2004 ) , we find five afterglows ( 050401 , 061121 , 070420 , 090424 , 090618 ) listed in table [ ag1 ] with chromatic x - ray breaks , hence their x - ray and optical emissions arise from different parts of the outflow , and eight with achromatic breaks , thus a comprehensive test of the x - ray break models can not be performed at this time .",
    "we note that , of those 8 afterglows with achromatic breaks , two ( 060729 , 081029 ) have @xmath280 , for five ( 050922c , 051109 , 060614 , 080710 , 090424 ) @xmath281 , and for one ( 090510 ) @xmath282 .",

    "we have considered only the forward - shock emission and ignored the emission from the reverse - shock , which energizes the grb / post - grb ejecta , the agent of energy injection into the blast - wave .",
    "the two shocks dissipate equally the kinetic energy of the ejecta , which indicates that the reverse - shock could make a comparable contribution to the afterglow emission .    for a short - lived ejecta source",
    ", it can be shown from the kinematics of the catch - up between the grb ejecta and the decelerating forward - shock that the ratio of the lorentz factor @xmath292 of the ejecta arriving at the forward - shock at time @xmath96 to that of the swept - up ambient medium @xmath108 is @xmath293^{1/2 } \\gta 1 $ ] ( evidently , the ratio of those two lorentz factors must be above unity , but can not be much above unity , else the catch - up would have occurred earlier ) . in this case , the reverse shock is only mildly relativistic and the ejecta electrons accelerated by the reverse - shock could be much less energetic than the electrons behind the forward - shock , making the emission of the latter dominant at x - ray photon energies .    for a long - lived central source , the contrast between the lorentz factor of the unshocked outflow and that of the forward - shock can be arbitrarily large , the reverse - shock could be highly relativistic , provided that the ejecta are not too dense ( e.g. sari & piran 1995 ) .",
    "the decay of the reverse - shock flux can be calculated in a way similar to that shown here for the forward - shock ; however , the parametrization of the reverse - shock emission is not that simple because @xmath17 ) its dynamics depends on the lorentz factor of the ejecta and their density , and @xmath18 ) its peak flux depends on the total ejecta mass having entered the reverse - shock .",
    "thus , the calculation of the reverse - shock emission requires at least two parameters that quantify the energy and mass mass injection into the blast - wave , leading to a model even less constrainable ( observationally ) than the forward - shock ( which requires only one parameter , @xmath32 , for the energy injection law ) .",
    "by comparing the flux decay index ( @xmath12 ) with the spectral slope ( @xmath13 ) measured for a set of 98 well - sampled swift x - ray afterglows with the expectations for the forward - shock model , we find that about a third of those afterglows display a break that could be the traditional ` jet - break ' claimed to have been observed in a dozen pre - swift optical afterglows (  [ adb ] ) .",
    "for this test of _ adiabatic _ jet - breaks , we have considered various details of the forward - shock model : homogeneous or wind - like ambient media , spectral cooling frequency higher or lower than the x - rays , synchrotron or inverse - compton as the dominant x - ray process , a collimated conical or spreading outflow . if a steady energy injection into the forward - shock occurs , then the jet - break model may account for 88 percent of the 117 light - curve breaks or , else put , for at least one break in 87 percent of the 98 afterglows selected here (  [ jbei ] ) .",
    "this vast improvement over the adiabatic jet model suggests that energy injection could be a prevalent process in grb afterglows .",
    "the remaining 12 percent of breaks that can not be explained by a jet - break undergoing a steady energy injection , and the 19 afterglows with two breaks ( only one being , at most , a jet - break ) , indicate that some x - ray breaks may originate from a change in the rate at which energy is added to the forward - shock ( an energy - injection break ) , and it is possible that some ( many ? ) of the identified jet - breaks are also energy - injection breaks (  [ eibr ] ) .",
    "it should be recognized that the complete success of the energy - injection break model over the traditional jet - break model could be due mostly to that the latter model is over - constrained ( observations provide two constraints : flux pre- and post - break power - law decay indices  for one model parameter : the energy injection power - law exponent ) , while the former model is not .",
    "we find a tentative correlation between the grb output and the afterglow x - ray flux decay rate , more energetic bursts being followed by faster decaying afterglows (  [ fag ] ) .",
    "if energy injection is a common process in grb afterglows , then the slower decaying afterglows should be identified with a stronger total energy injection .",
    "this means that the grb energy ",
    "afterglow ( x - ray flux ) decay rate correlation should lead to an anticorrelation of the grb output with the increase of the outflow kinetic energy during the afterglow phase , i.e. more energetic bursts should be followed by afterglows with less energy being injected .",
    "this anticorrelation is , indeed , observed for both the jet - break and the energy injection break models for x - ray light - curve breaks , and for various model details ( dynamics , x - ray afterglow emission process , radial stratification of the ambient medium ) .",
    "if the grb progenitor is a long - lived source of relativistic ejecta , the above anticorrelation implies an anticorrelation of the kinetic energy of the leading outflow ( producing the burst ) with that of the following ejecta ( which inject energy in the blast - wave during the afterglow phase ) , but the total ejecta energy ( burst plus afterglow ) is far from being universal .",
    "the energy budget required by most of the possible variants of the forward - shock model ranges from @xmath294 to @xmath295 ergs , and only variants involving inverse - compton emission in the x - rays and a wind - like medium can be excluded on energetic grounds because , in those models , the required jet - energy exceeds @xmath296 erg (  [ jeten ] ) .",
    "considering both models for light - curve breaks ( jet - break with steady energy - injection and energy - injection break ) , we find that the most energetically economical model is that of a narrow jet whose jet - break occurs early on ( before first x - ray measurement ) with the light - curve break being an energy - injection break , followed by a model where the x - ray light - curve break is a jet - break , with the most `` wasteful '' model being that of a wide jet whose break occurs late ( after last x - ray measurement ) , the x - ray break being an energy - injection break . however , the average ( over afterglows ) energy ratio among pairs of these three break models is only 23 .",

    "<S> +    since its launch in 2004 , the swift satellite has monitored the x - ray afterglows of several hundred gamma - ray bursts , and revealed that their x - ray light - curves are more complex than previously thought , exhibiting up to three power - law segments . energy injection into the relativistic blast - wave energizing the burst ambient medium </S>",
    "<S> has been proposed most often to be the reason for the x - ray afterglow complexity . </S>",
    "<S> we examine 117 light - curve breaks of 98 swift x - ray afterglows , selected for their high - quality monitoring and well - constrained flux decay rates . </S>",
    "<S> thirty percent of afterglows have a break that can be an adiabatic jet - break , in the sense that there is one variant of the forward - shock emission from a collimated outflow model that can account for both the pre- and post - break flux power - law decay indices , given the measured x - ray spectral slope . </S>",
    "<S> if allowance is made for a steady energy injection into the forward - shock , then another 56 percent of x - ray afterglows have a light - curve break that can be explained with a jet - break . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 12 percent that are not jet - breaks , as well as the existence of two breaks in 19 afterglows ( out of which only one can be a jet - break ) , suggest that some x - ray breaks arise from a sudden change in the rate at which energy is added to the blast - wave , and it may well be that a larger fraction of x - ray light - curve breaks are generated by that mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the fractional increase in the shock energy , inferred from the energy injection required to account for the observed x - ray flux decays , may be anticorrelated with the grb prompt output , whether the x - ray break is a jet - break or an energy - injection break . </S>",
    "<S> that anticorrelation can also be seen as bursts with a higher energy output being followed by faster fading x - ray afterglows . to test the above two mechanisms for afterglow light - curve breaks , </S>",
    "<S> we derive comprehensive analytical results for the dynamics of outflows undergoing energy injection and for their light - curves , including closure relations for inverse - compton afterglows and for the emission from spreading jets interacting with an wind - like ambient medium .     </S>",
