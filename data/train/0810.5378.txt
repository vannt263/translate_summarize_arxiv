    "searches for particle electric dipole moments ( edm ) are considered to be one of the most promising places to search for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "current experiments have reached the sensitivity where they have to take into account a systematic effect due to the influence on the particle s magnetic dipole moment of a combination of the motional magnetic field , @xmath1 due to the motion of the particle in the applied static electric field , and gradients in the ambient magnetic field . for slow motion ( adiabatic limit )",
    "the effect can be described as a geometric phase effect @xcite whereas a description in terms of the bloch - siegert shift is valid for fast motions as well ( @xcite ) .",
    "a treatment valid also for intermediate motions for particles moving in a cylindrical container has been given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this note we discuss some additional symmetries of the effect and present an analytic solution for the case of particles moving in a rectangular vessel .",
    "it is easy to see @xcite , that the effect depends only on motion in a plane perpendicular to the direction of @xmath2 ( parallel motion produces no @xmath3 ) .",
    "equations ( 23 and 36 ) in @xcite show that in general the frequency shift linear in @xmath2 which leads to the systematic error is given in terms of the spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function by @xmath4   \\label{one}\\ ] ] with@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the larmor frequency , @xmath7 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath8 is the homogeneous magnetic field taken as parallel to @xmath2 in the @xmath9 direction and @xmath10 is defined by@xmath11 . if the field is cylindrically symmetric@xmath12 and the result depends only on @xmath13 for all frequencies and geometries of the orbits . in the case",
    "that the trajectories have cylindrical symmetry@xmath14    this symmetry will hold in the high frequency limit ( @xmath15 ) which is determined by the short time behavior of the correlation function , and the result that the shift in this case depends only on @xmath16 has been obtained in @xcite , section iv b and by a different method in @xcite section iv a. the advantage of the present treatment is obvious .    an interesting case that can arise in practice",
    "is the symmetry@xmath17 in the high frequency limit this difference in the spectra will approach zero .",
    "in a rectangular box with specular reflecting walls the orbits are straight lines reflecting  at equal angles to the normal when they encounter a wall . with perpendicular walls parallel to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes the motion in each dimension will be independent of the other dimension and the angle with the normal will be preserved independently for the walls along @xmath18 and @xmath19 . at a wall collision",
    "the magnitude of velocity and the component parallel to the wall are unchanged and the perpendicular component of velocity changes sign .",
    "thus the correlation function for a given velcocity component @xmath20 starts at @xmath21 and after @xmath22 collisions is@xmath23 with the time between collisions @xmath24 , being constant for each orbit and @xmath25 the length of the box in direction @xmath26    thus the velocity correlation function for each direction is a square wave with the switching points being equally spaced but whose exact timing depends on the distance of the starting point of a given orbit from the first wall collision . averaging over these starting points proceeds as in equations 14 - 17 of @xcite .",
    "in fact the orbits are exactly those characterized by @xmath27 in that reference ( see fig.2 @xcite ) and the results of that paper can be applied to the present case by substituting @xmath28 thus equ",

    "this is plotted in figure 1 ) , which is to be compared with figure 3 ) of @xcite for the case of a cylinder .",
    "equation ( [ 4 ] ) and figure 1 ) apply to motion in one dimension . for the full 2 dimensional problem it is necessary to add together suitably normalized forms of the function for each dimension .",
    "the value of @xmath36 agrees with that predicted by the diffusion theory for the single dimension contribution to a rectangular box ( eqation 82 , @xcite ) , @xmath37 equation [ 4 ] shows that @xmath38 becomes independent of @xmath25 as the frequency increases and the larger the damping ( larger @xmath39 ) , the higher the frequency where this occurs .",
    "both the neutron edm experiment carried out by baker _ et al , _ @xcite and that being developed by the los alamos collaboration @xcite , make use of co - magnetometers , that is a gas of atoms occupying the same region as the ultra - cold neutrons and satisfying the maxwell - bolzmann velocity distribution . in this case",
    "we write the velocity as @xmath40 with @xmath41 the most probable velocity in a volume",
    ". then our one dimensional velocity @xmath42 has the probability distribution@xmath43 the spectral function of the frequency shift can then be rewritten@xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 and we have specialized to the case where the gas collision time , @xmath47 is independent of velocity .",
    "this is valid for the common case where the scattering cross section satisfies @xmath48 and holds in particular for the case of @xmath49 diffusing in superfluid @xmath50 which is the co - magnetometer in the lanl experiment @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the velocity of the @xmath49 is much less than the phonon velocity , the collision rate of the phonons with the @xmath49 will be independent of velocity and the mean free path satisfies @xmath51 .",
    "we obtain @xmath47 from @xmath52 with @xmath53 the mean square velocity in a volume of gas and @xmath54 has been measured at temperatures of interest @xcite@xmath55 we now average the frequency shift over the maxwell- boltzman distribution for velocity in one dimension@xmath56 the results are plotted in figure 2 ) :    the same result is shown as a function of temperature for fixed ( normalized ) frequency in fgure 3 .",
    "( note the frequency normalization is temperature dependent .",
    "equations [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] refer to  a single dimension . if the second dimension of the box has a length @xmath57 , then equation 4 can be written @xmath58 keeping the same normalization for @xmath59 and @xmath60:@xmath61\\ ] ]    averaging this as in equation [ 5 ] we obtain , @xmath62 @xmath63    figure 4 ) shows the two dimensional result for @xmath64 normalized to @xmath65 as a function of frequency normalized to @xmath66 for various temperatures while figure 5 ) shows the normalized shift vs temperature for various normalized frequencies .    in figure 6 )",
    "we show the contribution to the frequency shift for the two directions independently , compared to the results of numerical simulations , as well as the total frequency shift given by their sum for t=0.4k .",
    "the contribution of the short side ( @xmath19 ) has been normalized to the long side ( @xmath18 ) for the case @xmath67 we are assuming , for this discussion that the two components of the gradients are equal@xmath68 otherwise each curve in fig .",
    "6 will have to be multiplied by the appropriate gradient and the total effect will be altered .",
    "we see that around the zero crossing the contributions of the two dimensions contribute with opposite sign so the symmetry ( equation [ 3 ] ) does not hold and if we wish to operate near the zero crossing the result will depend on @xmath69 and @xmath70 separately and not on @xmath13 except in the case of cylindrical symmetry @xmath71    finally fig.7 shows the comparison of theory and numerical simulation for t=300mk .",
    "the calculations of the velocity correlation function ( vcf ) presented here and in @xcite , start by following a single trajectory with the collisions only damping the amplitude of the vcf and not changing the velocity components , @xmath72 as the particle moves along this trajectory .",
    "the simulations , on the other hand follow a particle as it is deflected to another ( randomly chosen ) trajectory by the collisions .",
    "essentially the theory follows the particles that havent collided while the simulations follow those that have .",
    "each collision , while conserving the kinetic energy ( magnitude of velocity ) , will result in a change of direction of the motion and hence of the @xmath18 and  @xmath19 components of velocity so the correlation function resulting from the simulation of a single trajectory will be quite different from that considered by the theoretical calculation .",
    "however , for each collision that takes a particle from trajectory ( 1 ) to trajectory ( 2 ) there should be a collision leading to the reverse transition according to detailed balance and when we average over all trajectories the results are seen to be the same .",
    "in addition while we have neglected the motion parallel to the e field we see that collisions will alter the velocity component in this direction , and , as a result of conservation of energy in the collisions , will thus alter the velocity in the perpendicular plane .",
    "however this effect will be cancelled when we average over all trajectories in the perpendicular plane as we have done here and in @xcite .",
    "( we note that due to the heavy mass and slow @xmath49 velocity , baym and ebner @xcite conclude that the phonon scattering on @xmath49 is predominantly elastic . )",
    "we have presented the general solution for the frequency shift linear in e , for the case of a rectangular box with specular reflecting walls .",
    "the effects of non - specular wall reflections are expected to be small for the case of heavy damping of interest with respect to the co - magnetometers . for ucn",
