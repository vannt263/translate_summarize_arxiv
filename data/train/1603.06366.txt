    "the study of multi - component nonlinear waves is one of the fascinating topics which has potential applications in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in atomic physics @xcite and optial fibers in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the realization of becs in weakly interacting atomic gases has strongly stimulated a large number of studies on exploring nonlinear properties of matter waves such as envelope solitons , gap solitons , soliton chains and so on @xcite .",
    "the development in trapping techniques for becs has allowed experimentalists to simulataneously confine atomic clouds in different hyperfine spin states or different atomic species .",
    "the first experiment involving interaction between multiple - species becs was performed in rubidium atoms which demonstrated the possibility of producing long - lived multiple condensate systems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the experimental demonstration of trapped multi - species becs have spurred great excitement in atomic physics and stimulated interest in studying various properties of two - component becs @xcite .",
    "a mixture of becs can be produced experimentally by simultaneously trapping atoms in different hyperfine states or two isotopes of the same element or of different species @xcite .",
    "recent experimental observations have also shown that the dark - bright and dark - dark vector solitons can be formed in certain two - species trapped dilute - gas becs @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the single - component case , such multicomponent condensates can present novel and fundamentally different scenarios for the collective dynamics and coherent structures due to the intercomponent interactions .    rogue waves ( rws ) are random nonlinear waves which occasionally rise up in the ocean which can attain amplitudes more than twice the value of background wave field @xcite .",
    "they appear from nowhere and disappear without a trace @xcite .",
    "rws were also noticed in a variety of physical systems such as optical fibers @xcite , superfluids @xcite and capillary waves @xcite .",
    "it was observed that modulational instability @xcite is responsible for the sudden rise in the wave amplitude in the ocean @xcite .",
    "recently , higher order rational solutions have been shown to attain even higher amplitudes of wave in the description of the rw phenomenon @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there has been a number of studies committed to rws in coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations ( cnlse ) .",
    "the cnlse also models water wave interactions @xcite and wave propagation in fiber communication system @xcite .",
    "the exact analytical rw solutions of the cnlse ( integrable manakov case ) @xcite and its generalized version have been presented in @xcite .",
    "further , becs have also been shown to constitute a good platform to explore the rws which allow one to understand deeply the nature and dynamics of rws under laboratory conditions .",
    "the possibility of identifying vector rws in multi - component becs provides us a rich phenomenology of nonlinear wave structures .",

    "several works have been exclusively devoted to construct soliton , rw and breather solutions of one - component becs @xcite and a few studies have been made to identify the vector soliton and rw solutions of two coupled gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite have studied the interaction of the rw with a dark - bright boomeranic soliton of a two - component variant of the nls equation of relevance to both atomic becs and nonlinear optics .",
    "furthermore , they have also examined the robustness of these structures in direct numerical simulation of the original nonautonomous system . in this paper , we focus our attention to study the characteristics of vector localized matter waves in two and three - component becs with a cigar - shaped trap . in this work",
    ", we first contruct several possible vector localized solutions for two - component becs , which can be described by a set of two coupled gpes with time - dependent scattering length ( which is the nonlinearity parameter ) and external trap potential . to capture localized solutions of this model we map the time - dependent two coupled gpes onto the coupled nlses through the similarity transformation method with an integrability condition between the time - dependent scattering length and the external trap potential . in particular , we consider three different forms of traps , namely ( i ) time - independent expulsive trap , ( ii ) time - dependent monotonic trap , and ( iii ) time - dependent periodic trap .",
    "we identify the possibility of vector localized solutions , namely rws , dark soliton - rw , bright soliton - rw and rw - breather - like structures depending upon the specific values of a particular parameter in the obtained solutions .",
    "we then investigate in detail how the nature of these localized density profiles gets modifed by adjusting the trap parameter .",
    "we depict and analyze the trajectories of the nonautonomous vector rws .",
    "we also construct the dark - dark rw solution for repulsive - repulsive interaction of the two coupled gpes and investigate their dynamical evolution when we tune the strength of the trap parameter . in the time - independent trap case our results show that for low values of the trap parameter the vector localized structures are more stable , due to their prolonged existence with respect to time . by increasing the trap parameter ,",
    "the localized structures become more and more localized in time , that is localized structures are short - lived , whereas they get stretched or more delocalized in space in a constant density background . in the time - dependent monotonic trap case with high value of the trap parameter , we could not observe any localized structures while @xmath0 because of the form of the nature of potential .",
    "finally , by replacing the monotonic trap with the periodic trap potential , the localized structures exist on a periodic background when the trap parameter is tuned .",
    "one can also observe that the localized waves lose their stability by way of getting delocalized in space as the potential strength is increased slowly .",
    "while no rigorous quantitative criteria can be identified to locate the point of instability , this can be checked numerically in the original nonautonomous system .",
    "we then construct composite rw solutions for three - component becs which are described by a coupled set of three gpes with variable scattering length and external trap potential .",
    "again , we transform the time - dependent three coupled gpes to the three coupled nls equations under the integrability condition through similarity transformation method . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors restrict the parameter values in the obtained generalized rw solutions and discuss the feasibility of single , two and three composite rws for three - component nls systems .",
    "they in fact report that the rw solution exhibits a peculiar structure , namely a four - petaled structure , in contrast to the eye - shaped structure of rw . motivated by this work",
    ", we construct the rw ( single , two and three composite rw ) solutions and analyze how to control these localized density profiles in three - component becs .",
    "furthermore we investigate the characteristics of these localized density profiles when we tune the strength of the trap parameter in the above trap potentials .",
    "our results show that in the case of time - independent trap potential the rw structures maintain their stability when the trap parameter is small and the rw structures become more and more localized in time and stretched ( delocalized ) in space when we increase the trap parameter .",
    "next we consider the case of time - dependent monotonic trap , and here also we note that the rw structures are more localized in time , delocalized in space and reach the higher density background . finally , in the time - dependent periodic trap case",
