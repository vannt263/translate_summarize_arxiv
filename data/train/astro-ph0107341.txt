    "armandroff & zinn ( 1988 ) determined the metal abundance of ngc  6441 to be [ fe / h ] = -0.53 @xmath7 0.11 , making it slightly more metal - rich than 47 tucanae on their metallicity scale .",
    "one might therefore have expected that the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc  6441 would show the stubby red horizontal branch ( hb ) typical of metal - rich globular clusters such as 47 tuc .",
    "the cmd of ngc  6441 does indeed show a strong , red hb component , but rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) observations , discovered that the cmd of ngc  6441 also has a pronounced blue hb component , which stretches across the location of the instability strip . not only does the hb have a blue component , but it also slopes upward as one goes blueward in a ( @xmath4 , @xmath8 ) cmd .",
    "ngc  6441 is not , however , unique in these characteristics : rich et al",
    ". showed that the cmd of the relatively metal - rich globular cluster ngc  6388 has a similar hb morphology .",
    "it has long been known that the hb morphology of globular clusters does not correlate perfectly with [ fe / h ] and that at least one parameter besides [ fe / h ] is needed to account for this ( sandage & wildey 1967 ; van den bergh 1967 ) .",
    "ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 are the only metal - rich globular clusters known to exhibit this second parameter effect .",
    "sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) constructed cmd simulations of metal - rich globular clusters to test various theoretical scenarios which might account for the unusual hb morphologies in ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 .",
    "they found that the upward slope of the hbs could not be explained by differences in either cluster age , mass loss on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , or differential reddening .",
    "layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) would later , on observational grounds , also rule out the hypothesis of differential reddening .",
    "sweigart & catelan did arrive at three theoretical scenarios for explaining the hb morphology : ( 1 ) a high cluster helium abundance ; ( 2 ) a rotation scenario in which rotation during the rgb phase increases the hb core mass ; and ( 3 ) a mixing scenario , in which deep mixing on the rgb enhances the envelope helium abundance .",
    "all three of these scenarios predict that any rr lyrae stars ( rrls ) in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 should be anomalously bright .",
    "although at the time little was known about rr lyrae stars in ngc  6441 , the few rr lyrae stars known in ngc  6388 had properties which were consistent with an unusually high luminosity ( ref .",
    "3 , sweigart & catelan 1998 ) .",
    "sweigart ( 1999 ) suggested an additional scenario : some stars might form dust grains which are then removed from the envelope by radiation pressure at the tip of the rgb , leaving behind metal - depleted gas .",
    "the overall metal abundance of the envelope might then be reduced if the metal - depleted gas can be convectively mixed throughout the envelope .",
    "one would then expect an hb star that has undergone such metal - depletion to be both bluer and brighter than would otherwise be the case . as a variation of this metal - depletion scenario , sweigart ( 2001 ) suggested that the unusual hb morphology in ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 might also be due to an intrinsic spread in metallicity among the stars in these clusters , a possibility first noted by piotto et al .",
    "detailed stellar evolution calculations have shown that a metallicity spread can produce upward sloping hbs similar to those observed in these clusters ( sweigart 2001 ) . under this scenario",
    "ngc  6441 , along with ngc  6388 , would be metal - rich analogs of @xmath9  centauri , the only galactic globular cluster known to contain a spread in metallicity .",
    "layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used ground - based @xmath4 and @xmath10 photometry of ngc  6441 to study its cmd and its variable star population .",
    "they discovered about 50 new variable stars in the vicinity of ngc  6441 , including 11 rrls which they believed to be probable members of the cluster and 9 other suspected cluster variables , 6 of which were candidate rrls .",
    "the rrab stars which they believed to be probable members had unusually long periods . their locations in the period - amplitude diagram ( ref .",
    "figure 9 , layden et al .",
    "1999 ) were consistent with the models of sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) , implying that the rrls were indeed unusually bright .",
    "layden et al . also found a value of 1.6 for the ratio @xmath11 of hb stars to rgb stars , implying that the helium abundance of ngc  6441 is not extraordinarily high .",
    "thus , the high helium scenario seems to be effectively ruled out .    this paper reports new @xmath12 and @xmath4 photometry of ngc  6441 which has led to the discovery of additional variable stars .",
    "preliminary results from these observations have already been used to argue that the rrls in ngc  6441 are unusually bright for the cluster metallicity ( pritzl et al .",
    "2000 ) . here",
    "we present the results of the new study in detail and call attention to several unusual properties of rrls in ngc  6441 .",
    "the results for ngc  6388 will be reported in a separate paper ( pritzl et al .",
    "time series observations of ngc  6441 were obtained at the 0.9 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory using the tek 2k no .",
    "3 ccd detector with a field size of 13.5 arcmin per side . time series observations of ngc 6441 were obtained on the ut dates of 1998/may/26 - 29 and 1998/june/1 - 4 .",
    "exposures of 600 seconds were obtained in both @xmath12 and @xmath4 filters .",
    "the seeing ranged from 1.1 to 2.5 arcsec , with a typical seeing of 1.4 arcsec .",
    "images were centered 4 arcmin east of the cluster center , to avoid including a bright foreground star within the field .",
    "twilight sky flats were taken on nights 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "the sky flats were examined for any nightly variations and no significant variations were detected .",
    "the sky flats were then combined into one master sky flat that was used for each frame .",
    "corrections for bias and flat fielding were done using conventional iraf routines .",
    "a total of 23 photometric standards from landolt ( 1992 ) and graham ( 1982 ) were observed on june 1 , 2 , and 3 . they were typically observed four times during the night .",
    "these primary standard stars spanned a color range from @xmath13 to 2.326  mag , adequate to cover the color range of the reddened stars in ngc  6441 .",
    "primary standards were observed between airmasses 1.035 and 1.392 . according to the ctio sky condition archive ( http://www.ctio.noao.edu/site/phot/sky_conditions.html ) , only the night of june 1 was photometric , but standards observed on the nonphotometric nights",
    "were incorporated in the reductions using the  cloudy \" night reduction routines created by peter stetson ( private communications ) .",
    "this allowed us to make use of a broader range of colors from the primary standards observed on the other nights to better define the color terms in the transformation equation .",
    "photometry of stars in the ngc  6441 field was obtained using the standalone reduction packages created by stetson ( 1994 ) : daophot ii , allstar , and allframe .",
    "point - spread functions ( psf ) were calculated for each frame from a set of 80 bright , uncrowded stars , using the variable psf option .",
    "instrumental magnitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the ngc  6441 stars were transformed to johnson @xmath4 and @xmath12 magnitudes using stetson s trial package .",
    "thirty nine local standards within the ngc  6441 field were used to set the frame - by - frame zero - points for the cluster observations .",
    "because ngc 6441 was observed to higher airmass than the landolt ( 1992 ) and graham ( 1982 ) standards , the local standards were also used to check the adopted values of the extinction coefficients for the night of june 1 .",
    "the observations of the local standards confirmed the values of the extinction coefficients determined from the primary standards .",
    "transformation equations derived from the standard stars had the form :    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the airmass and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the zero point shifts for their respective filters . comparing the transformed magnitudes of the standard stars with the values given by graham and landolt",
    ", we find rms residuals of 0.018 magnitudes in @xmath4 and 0.006 magnitudes in @xmath12 .",
    "the photometry of stars in the ngc  6441 field could be compared with photometry in three earlier studies , as shown in table  1 .",
    "first , our @xmath12 and @xmath4 photometry was compared with the hst @xmath12 , @xmath4 photometry obtained by rich et al .",
    "unfortunately , even the outermost stars in the field of view of wfpc2 tended to be crowded on the images obtained at ctio . the comparison with rich et al .",
    "is therefore based upon only 13 stars for which the crowding on our images , although still significant , is small enough to allow a meaningful comparison .",
    "our ground - based photometry is brighter in @xmath4 by about 0.04 mag .",
    "no significant difference in @xmath12 is evident",
    ".    a larger number of comparisons could be made with the photoelectric and photographic photometry of hesser & hartwick ( 1976 ) . in figure 1",
    "we show the differences between our results and the local standards established by hesser & hartwick . at low @xmath8",
    ", there is some scatter , but the mean differences are small .",
    "the results are more discordant for the reddest stars . excluding stars with @xmath21  mag",
    ", we obtained the results listed in table  1 .",
    "our mean @xmath4 and @xmath12 values are slightly brighter than those of hesser & hartwick by an amount smaller than or comparable to the standard error of the mean .",
    "we are not certain of the origin of the greater discrepancy for very red stars , though we note that these more discrepant stars tended to be among the fainter as well as the redder stars used in the comparison .",
    "our inclusion of a second - order color term in our transformation equations produced no significant decrease in the discrepancy at larger @xmath8 values .",
    "it is noteworthy that figure 1 shows no trend with @xmath8 for the bluer colors relevant to the region of the rrls .",
    "no trend with color was seen in the comparison of our results with the hst photometry .    finally , we compared our @xmath4 magnitudes with the @xmath4 photometry of layden et al .",
    "as indicated in table  1 , our @xmath4 photometry and that of layden et al .",
    "are surprisingly discrepant .",
    "we have no good explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "the agreement between our @xmath4 photometry and that of rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and hesser & hartwick ( 1976 ) suggests that there is a zero - point error of approximately 0.4  mag in the layden et al . photometry .",
    "the cmd was the critical tool for the initial discovery of the unusual nature of ngc  6441 . for this reason we will now compare our new cmds with those presented by rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows four cmds obtained from our photometry for stars lying at different distances from the center of ngc  6441 .",
    "a total of 14127 stars make up the cmd in figure 2a . only the stars with values of @xmath22 from stetson s trial program were included .",
    "the strong red component of the hb is evident ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) as is its blue extension .",
    "we also see many features of the field bulge population , which are particularly prominent since our images are shifted off of the cluster center to avoid a foreground star .",
    "the main sequence of the field extends up through the cluster s hb from about @xmath25 to @xmath26  mag and from about @xmath27 to @xmath28  mag .",
    "the field red hb clump is found at @xmath29  mag and @xmath30  mag .",
    "the contribution of the bulge stars to the cmd of figure 2a can be seen in figure 2d , where we have plotted all stars that are 6 - 11 arcmin eastward from the cluster center [ the tidal radius of ngc  6441 extends to 8.0 arcmin ( harris 1996 ) ] .    one interesting feature on the diagrams of ngc  6441 , which can also be seen in the cmds of rich et al . ( 1997 ) and layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , is a small clumping of stars slightly fainter and redder than the red hb of ngc  6441 ( @xmath31 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "this appears to be the rgb luminosity function bump .",
    "although this bump is difficult to discern in figure 2 , its presence in the hst cmd makes it likely to be associated with the cluster .",
    "an investigation into its properties might constrain the helium content of the cluster ( sweigart 1978 ; fusi pecci et al . 1990 ; zoccali et al .",
    "1999 ; bono et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "figure 2b is our closest approximation to the area covered by the cmd of rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , including stars within a radius extending out to approximately 1.7 arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "the morphology of the hb is clearer in this figure and figure 2c . not only",
    "do we see the sloped nature of the blue extension to the hb , but the slope in the red hb is also seen as was first noted by piotto et al .",
    "the hb slopes from @xmath32  mag , at @xmath33  mag , to @xmath34  mag , at @xmath35  mag .",
    "rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) mentioned that there may be a hint for a bimodal distribution of the stars on the hb of ngc 6441 .",
    "there appears to be a gap ranging in color from 1.0 to 0.4 mag in their figure 1 .",
    "such a bimodality is not seen in our cmds , although field stars and differential reddening may be filling in any gap in the hb .",
    "it is possible that this gap may be due to the rrl being plotted at their instantaneous magnitudes instead of their time averaged magnitude and color in the rich et al .",
    "looking at our figure 4 , it is seen that the rrl fill in the hb in that region .",
    "variable stars were identified in two ways : first , stetson s daomaster routine was used to compare the rms scatter in our photometric values to that expected from the photometric errors returned by the allframe program .",
    "second , we applied the variable star search algorithm presented by stetson ( 1996 ) .",
    "results from the two approaches were very similar .",
    "the time coverage of our observations is well suited for the discovery of short period variability , but not for the detection of long period variables .",
    "all of the probable short period variable stars identified by layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which were within our field were recovered during our variable star searches .",
    "in addition , 48 probable new variable stars were detected , along with 6 suspected variables . in crowded regions close to the cluster center ,",
    "the @xmath12 photometry proved superior to the @xmath4 photometry for purposes of identifying variable stars , presumably because of the lesser interference from bright red giant stars . finding information for the new variable stars",
    "is given in table  2 , where @xmath18 ,  @xmath36 are the coordinates of the variables on the ccd [ the cluster center is assumed to be at ( 1635,1051 ) ] and @xmath37 ,  @xmath38 are the differences in right ascension and declination from the cluster center ( in arcsec ) .",
    "finding charts for the variables , excluding the long period variables , can be seen in figure 3 .      the number of probable rrl stars in the ngc  6441 field has been increased from 11 to 46 .",
    "the location of these stars within the cmd is shown in figure 4 .",
    "all previously known cluster rrl have been rediscovered except for layden et al.s ( 1999 ) v36 , a field star lying outside the field of our observations .",
    "table  3 lists the mean properties of the individual rrl stars found in this survey , along with one @xmath39 scuti or sx phoenicis star .",
    "all periods were found using the phase dispersion minimization program in iraf .",
    "the accuracy of these periods is @xmath40  d to @xmath41  d , depending on the scatter and completeness of the light curve .",
    "the periods determined for the known rrl are in good agreement with those found by layden et al .",
    "magnitude weighted and luminosity weighted mean magnitudes were calculated using spline fits to the observations .",
    "the listed @xmath42 values are luminosity weighted , but the colors are magnitude weighted , @xmath43 .",
    "light curves and photometry for the variable stars in @xmath4 and @xmath12 are given in figure 5 , table  4 and table  5 , respectively .",
    "the mean level of the ngc  6441 hb determined from the probable rrl members , excluding the brighter and redder rrab ( see  4.4 ) and rrl with uncertain classification , is @xmath44  mag .    as was noted by layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , it can occasionally be difficult to distinguish rrc variables from eclipsing binary stars which have periods twice as long .",
    "this is particularly true for a cluster such as ngc  6441 , in which a significant and variable reddening makes the precise location of a variable star in the cmd an uncertain guide as to the type of the variable .",
    "although not always decisive , inspection of the fourier decompositon parameters of the light curves can be an aid in classifying variables , and in distinguishing rrab from rrc variables .",
    "fourier decompositions of the light curves were done fitting to an equation of the form :    @xmath45    plotting the fourier parameters @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 gives a clear distinction between rrl types ( e.g. clement & shelton 1997 ) , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "figure 6 shows a @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 plot for the probable rrl variables in the ngc  6441 field which have clean light curves .",
    "the data are listed in table  6 .",
    "the probable rrl fall into areas of the diagram where rrab and rrc stars would indeed be expected .",
    "a clear break between the rrl types can be seen at @xmath46 of 0.3 as was originally shown by simon & teays ( 1982 ) , with the rrab falling at values greater than this and the rrc below .",
    "it should be noted that v49 falls in the same region as the other rrc variables furthering the case for its reclassification ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "we also see how the field star v54 stands apart from the cluster variables .    using these rrl with quality light curves as a reference",
    ", we are able to analyze the other variables found in the field of ngc  6441 . table  7 lists the fourier values for the contact binaries and the rrl with poorer light curves and uncertain membership or classification .",
    "it is clear that the contact binaries have values of @xmath50 .",
    "this provides a good distinction between the rrl and the contact binaries .",
    "there is still the question of how to determine if a variable is a rrc star or a contact binary star with a period twice as long . to test this we wanted to see how the fourier parameters of a known rrc star would compare to those of known contact binaries",
    "if it was analyzed at the longer period that it would have were it a contact binary .",
    "we performed a fourier analysis on v70 , which is clearly a rrc variable and fits in well with the other rrc in the @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 plot , at the longer period of 0.852  d. the resulting @xmath46 value , 25.90 , would indicate that it was a binary star . in order to test how contact",
    "binary stars compare to known rrc stars , we also analyzed two stars that are clearly contact binary stars , v86 and v88 , at the shorter periods that they would have if they were rrc stars .",
    "the data is shown in table  8 . comparing these results to the rrc in figure  6 ,",
    "the @xmath46 values are a little high and the @xmath47 values are low . although more tests should be done to verify this , it appears that if one analyzes a star at a rrc - type period , a true rrc star will fall among the other rrc stars in the @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 plot , while a binary star will be offset to low @xmath47 values and slightly higher @xmath46 values . for comparison , as stated before , the fourier values for v49 imply that it is a rrc variable rather than a contact binary . on the other hand ,",
    "the values for v81 at the shorter rrc - like period imply that it may indeed be better classified as a contact binary .",
    "the period - amplitude diagrams for this cluster in @xmath12 and @xmath4 are seen in figure 7 .",
    "there are a few rrab variables whose amplitudes are low for their period .",
    "some of these are probably attributable to noisy photometry ( v46 , v52 , v53 , and v55 ) , while others are due to possible blending effects ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "the blazhko effect can also reduce the amplitudes of rrab stars , but our observations do not extend over a long enough time interval to test for the presence of this effect . another striking feature is the lack of a significant gap between the shortest period rrab and the longest period rrc ( see  5.2 and  5.4 ) .      v45 - v45 appears to stand out from the other cluster variables .",
    "the shape of the light curve indicates that the variable is of ab type .",
    "although our data have a gap in the light curve near minimum making its magnitude and color uncertain , we were able to determine a period similar to that in layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , whose phase coverage is more complete .",
    "layden et al .",
    "list the @xmath4 amplitude of the star as 0.73  mag .",
    "we estimate the amplitude to be about 0.85  mag from our data .",
    "when we place this variable in the period - amplitude diagram for the cluster ( figure 7 ) , it clearly stands apart from the variables we feel certain are cluster members .",
    "it is our belief that v45 is a field rrl that happens to fall at nearly the same distance as the cluster .",
    "v49 - v49 was classified by layden and collaborators as a possible detached binary with a period of 1.010  d. our data indicate that this variable may instead be classified as an rrc - type variable with a period one third as long . at a period of 0.335  d , our data for one night ( @xmath51",
    "h ) nearly complete one cycle .",
    "when the layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) observations are fit to a 0.335  d period , we get a light curve similar to our own , although with some scatter .",
    "v49 lies toward the outer parts of ngc  6441 .",
    "the color of the star fits well with the other cluster rrc , but it is slightly brighter . as stated in  4.2 , the fourier values for this star place it among the other rrc stars .",
    "we are unable to determine what , if any , reddening effects may be responsible for the difference in brightness .",
    "although we believe that v49 is more likely to be an rrc than a detached binary , more photometry of this star would be useful in making a definite determination .",
    "v52 - this variable has a period , magnitude , and color that would classify it as being an ab - type rrl .",
    "yet , it is interesting to note that its light curve has a more sinusoidal shape . to illustrate the difference , it is useful to compare the light curve of v52 with those of v46 , whose period is slightly longer , and v53 , whose period is similar to v52 . both v46 and v53 exhibit a sharper rise in light to maximum , whereas v52 has a more gentle slope .",
    "v54 - this variable is an rrab with a clean light curve .",
    "it is @xmath52  mag brighter than other cluster rrab variables .",
    "in addition , the location of v54 far from the cluster center indicates that it is a likely field variable .",
    "v54 may also be intrinsically fainter than the cluster rrab given its position in the period - amplitude diagram ( figure 7 ) .",
    "v64 - this star is blended with a close neighbor , only 1.3 arcsec away .",
    "the rr lyrae - like periodicity shows up in the photometry of both stars , indicating that the photometry of both is probably affected by the blending .",
    "therefore , it is likely that only one of the two stars is actually a variable .",
    "the @xmath12 light curves for each star have scatter , with the amplitude of v64 being 0.95 mag and that of the neighbor being 0.60 mag .",
    "the @xmath4 curves show a lot of scatter with amplitudes around 0.30 mag .",
    "the mean magnitudes for the companion star are @xmath53  mag and @xmath54  mag .",
    "v67 - this variable is found only @xmath55  arcsec east from a much brighter star .",
    "therefore blending was a problem for some of the nights with poorer seeing .",
    "these data points were removed from the light curve .",
    "although its color is similar to the other rrab stars believed to be on the ngc  6441 hb , it is slightly brighter",
    ". this may be a consequence of its proximity to the bright star .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the ratio of @xmath12 to @xmath4 amplitude is not unusual .",
    "its large distance away from the cluster center could indicate that v67 is a field star .",

    "v68 - ( sv1 , layden et al . )",
    "we are still uncertain as to how to classify this variable .",
    "it appears as though the scatter in its curve comes from blending with a close companion star .",
    "also , coma may be affecting our photometry since v68 is found near the edge of the frame .",

    "the difference between our distance determination and theirs can be found in the adopted metallicity for ngc 6441 and in the reddening which in turn affects the adopted extinction .",
    "one should note that the ab - type rrl in ngc  6441 by their very nature are different from those which blanco used in establishing his relationship between metallicity , period , and intrinsic color .",
    "we have assumed here that his formula is applicable to the rrab stars in ngc  6441 .",
    "this might not be the case .",
    "bono et al . (",

    "( 1999 ) and pritzl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the rrl in ngc  6441 have unusually long periods for a metal - rich globular cluster .",
    "clusters as metal - rich as ngc  6441 usually have few if any rrl stars .",
    "if indeed such a cluster did have numerous rrls , then , from what is known of metal - rich field rrls , one would expect the mean period of its rrab stars to be even shorter than those of oosterhoff type i globular clusters .",
    "in actuality , the long mean periods of the rrl in ngc  6441 , and its high @xmath79 ratio ( where @xmath80 is the number of rrc stars and @xmath81 is the total number of rrl in the system ) , are closer to the values expected in a metal - poor oosterhoff ii globular cluster .",
    "the value of @xmath82 for the rrl is long even for oosterhoff ii systems .    in figure 8 , we plot the mean periods of the rrab stars in ngc  6441 and in oosterhoff i and oosterhoff ii clusters as a function of their parent cluster metallicity , including ngc  6388 ( pritzl et al .",
    "2001 ) . as was shown in pritzl et al .",

    "we conclude , as did pritzl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , that ngc  6441 does not fall into either of the usual oosterhoff groups in this diagram .",
    "it has also been argued that evolutionary effects may be the cause of the oosterhoff dichotomy .",
    "clement & shelton ( 1999 ) , lee & carney ( 1999 ) , and clement & rowe ( 2000 ) have argued that the location of rrab stars in the period - amplitude diagram is more a function of oosterhoff type rather than metal abundance .",
    "indeed , the rrab stars in figure 7 do fall along the line for rrab stars in oosterhoff ii clusters as given by clement ( 2000 ; private communication ) .",
    "we performed the compatibility condition test of jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) on the rrab stars in ngc  6441 .",
    "the @xmath83 values are listed in table  6 .",
    "we find that only 4 of 14 rrab stars have a value of @xmath83 smaller than the cutoff of 5.0 suggested by clement & shelton ( 1997 ) as appropriate for identifying ",
    "normal \" rrab light curves from fourier fits of the order we used .",
    "the interpretation of this result in the case of the ngc  6441 variables is uncertain , however .",
    "large values of @xmath83 can be caused by light curves which do not have  normal \" shapes , but can also result from the analysis of low quality light curves .",
    "in addition , the applicability of the @xmath83 criterion to the characterization of the very long period rrab light curves found in ngc  6441 has not been established . because of the short time span covered by our observations , it is also possible that stars showing the blazhko effect might not be identified as such by inspection or by the @xmath83 criterion in our dataset . due to these uncertainties , in the following analysis we will include ngc  6441 variables which have light curves showing little scatter and having no significant gaps , rather than include only variables with values of @xmath83 smaller than 5.0 .",
    "clement & rowe ( 2000 ) also used the masses and luminosities of the rrc stars to illustrate the differences between the oosterhoff groups .",
    "their table  4 shows 7 globular clusters arranged in order of increasing @xmath84 for the rrc variables , where the rrc luminosities have been determined from fourier parameter @xmath85 , where @xmath86 . making use of their eqs . 2 - 5 , which derive from simon & clement ( 1993a , 1993b ) , and the fourier parameters listed in table  6 , we have calculated the masses , luminosities , temperatures , and absolute magnitudes for a small number of rrc stars in ngc  6441 ( see table  13 ) .",
    "following the criteria for acceptable stars in their paper we excluded all long period rrc stars ( see  5.2 ) since these stars were shown to have abnormally low derived masses and included only the rrc stars with an error in @xmath87 below a certain limit .",
    "our cutoff for the error in the @xmath87 measurement was 0.50 , instead of 0.20 used by clement & rowe , to allow a larger sampling of stars . after this restriction we only kept rrc stars with light curves having low scatter and low errors for the data points .",
    "the rrc with the best light curve was v70 . leaving out v71 and v77 , for which the simon & clement equations yield especially low masses , we find the mean values for the rrc star mass , @xmath84 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 are @xmath90 , 1.65 , 7408  k , and 0.79 . if we were to include v71 and v77",
    ", the mean values would change to @xmath91 , 1.65 , 7403  k , and 0.79 , which are not significant changes . by the criterion of either mean luminosity or mean @xmath88 , the rrc stars of ngc  6441 appear to fall among the oosterhoff i clusters in clement & rowe s table  4 .",
    "this , of course , contradicts the result obtained above from the rrab period - amplitude diagram .",
    "it should be noted that the masses calculated for _ all _ of the rrc stars tend to be low .",
    "the mean mass of @xmath90 is about @xmath92 smaller than the canonical helium core mass at the helium flash ( cf .",
    "table  1 in sweigart 1987 ; see also sweigart 1994 and catelan , de freitas pachaco , & horvath 1996 for extensive discussions of possible sources of uncertainty in the helium core mass at the helium flash ) .",
    "it is unlikely that a star with this mass would become a rrl star .",
    "scatter in the light curves and/or a lack of highly sampled light curves may lead to uncertainties in the fourier decomposition .",
    "the sinusoidal shape of the light curves of the rrc stars results in large uncertainties in the @xmath93 and @xmath87 estimates due to the @xmath94 and @xmath95 phases being determined with low precision . while this may lead to scatter in the derived rrc parameters , it can not account for the systematically low values for the masses .",
    "one possible reason for the low mass values could be that a problem with the zero point in the simon & clement ( 1993a , 1993b ) calibration for the rrc masses exists . in any case",
    ", it appears that even in this oosterhoff classification based on derived physical parameters for the rrc stars , ngc  6441 has difficulty being classified as either an oosterhoff type i or oosterhoff type ii cluster .",
    "( further points on this classification scheme are discussed in  5.4 ,  5.5 , and  6 . )",
    "another possible explanation for the low rrc masses is that the fourier relations derived by simon & clement ( 1993a , 1993b ) may not be applicable to the rrc in ngc 6441 , especially if some noncanonical effect is responsible for the blue extension of the hb .    given the existence of long period rrc stars in ngc 6441 (  5.2 ) , and the unusually low masses obtained for the rrc stars with periods near 0.3 days , one might wonder if some of the shorter period rrl might be second overtone pulsators .",
    "however , the light curves for these stars appear not very different from those of shorter period rrc stars in other clusters , and the location of these stars in the @xmath96 versus @xmath93 diagram ( figure 6 ) is also broadly consistent with the locations of rrc stars in other clusters .",
    "it was also shown by clement & rowe ( 2000 ) that potential second - overtone rrl tend to have @xmath4 amplitudes less than 0.3 mag .",
    "this is not the case for the rrc stars in ngc  6441 .",
    "parameters for the rrab stars in ngc 6441 were derived using the jurcsik - kovcs method ( jurcsik & kovcs 1996 ; kovcs & jurcsik 1997 ) . the fourier parameters for the rrab stars with good light curves are listed in table  6 and were corrected to work in the jurcsik - kovcs method which is based on a sine decomposition .",
    "equations 1 , 2 , 5 , 11 , 17 , and 22 from jurcsik ( 1998 ) were used to calculate the parameters listed in table  14 .",
    "the values of @xmath84 and @xmath97 were increased by 0.1 and 0.016 , respectively , following the prescription in jurcsik & kovcs ( 1999 ) .",
    "the mean values for the mass , @xmath84 , @xmath97 , @xmath70 , and [ fe / h ] are 0.54  @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "comparing these results to the empirical data in figure 1 of jurcsik & kovcs ( 1999 ) , we see that the mean value of @xmath84 for ngc 6441 is about 0.05 brighter than the data from jurcsik & kovcs at the metallicity of -0.53 .",
    "this agrees with our assertion that the rrl in ngc 6441 are unusually bright for their metallicity .",
    "while the value for the mean mass of the ngc 6441 rrab stars is consistent with the cluster metallicity , the mean value for @xmath97 is about 0.02 lower than the data given by jurcsik & kovcs ( 1999 ) . comparing the mean value of @xmath89 given by the rrab parameters against the value given by eq .",
    "5 in kovcs & jurcsik ( 1996 ) relating @xmath89 to [ fe / h ] , the absolute magnitude given by our rrab stars is about 0.25 mag brighter , where @xmath103 } + 1.04 = 0.94 $ ] for @xmath61 } = -0.53 $ ] .",
    "possibly the most interesting result to come out of the analysis of the rrab is the low metallicity of @xmath61 } = -0.99 $ ] . according to eq . 4 of jurcsik ( 1995 ) , this metallicity is actually -1.3 on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale .",
    "this seems unusually low when compared to the cluster metallicity derived by armandroff & zinn ( 1988 ) of -0.53 .",
    "there is some question as to the validity of applying the jurcsik - kovcs method to the rrab stars in ngc  6441 , given their unusually longer periods .",
    "we nonetheless note that the mean metallicity we derive in this way is close to that predicted by the hb models of sweigart ( 2001 ) , which yeilded a best fitting track for a [ fe / h ] of approximately -1.4 , assuming an @xmath104 enhancement of @xmath105 } = + 0.3 $ ] .",
    "such a low metallicity for the rrab stars would of course imply that there is a real spread in metallicity among the ngc  6441 stars (  5.5 ) .    as pointed out by pritzl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , ngc  6441 contains an unusually large number of long period ( @xmath106 day ) rrab . considering all candidate rrab stars believed to be members of ngc  6441",
    ", we find @xmath107 ( 10 out of 26 ) of the rrab to have periods greater than 0.8 day .",
    "although other clusters are known to contain long period rrl such as these , most notably @xmath9 centauri , to our knowledge no other cluster has such a large proportion of long period rrab .",
    "this large proportion of very long period rrab stars , a property ngc  6388 shares with ngc  6441 ( pritzl et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) , is thus an additional way in which ngc  6441 is distinguished from typical oosterhoff type ii clusters .",
    "kemper ( 1982 ) showed that there are few metal - rich rrc stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "rrls of any type are rare in the more metal - rich globular clusters .",
    "the unusual nature of ngc  6441 gives us an opportunity to investigate c - type rrl in an environment more metal rich than those in which they are usually found , either in globular clusters or in the field .",
    "although the periods of a few of the rrc in ngc  6441 do tend to fall at longer values , we see that @xmath108 , as given in table  12 , is not unusually large compared to values found in oosterhoff ii globular clusters ( sandage 1982 ) .",
    "the light curves of the ngc  6441 rrc stars also seem to have some distinguishing features .",
    "as the period goes to longer values , the bump seen during rising brightness tends to be found at earlier phases . for most , but not all , of the shorter period rrc we find the bump occurring at a phase @xmath109 before maximum while for the longer period ones , such as v69 and v76 , it occurs at @xmath110 before maximum .",
    "recent progress in the nonlinear , convective hydrodynamic modeling of the light curves of rrc stars ( bono , castellani , & marconi 2000 ) may soon determine the physical properties responsible for such peculiarities .",
    "layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) mentioned that the light curves of ngc  6441 rrc stars exhibit longer than usual rise times .",

    "while the longer period rrc variables do have rise intervals around 0.5 , we find that on average , most were @xmath112 .",

    "the lack of such stars in other clusters once again demonstrates the unusual nature of ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 , and provides another way in which the clusters appear to be different from typical oosterhoff type ii systems .",
    "this suggests that the rrl variables in ngc  6441 may , perhaps surprisingly , belong to a metal - poor component similar to the one to which the long - period rrc s in @xmath9  cen belong ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "again , we note that there are no direct metallicity measurements for the rrl in ngc  6441 , and that , in this paper , we have hitherto assumed them to have the overall cluster [ fe / h ] value .",
    "piotto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) first noted that the rgb of ngc  6441 shows an intrinsic spread in color . after rejecting the possibility that differential reddening is the cause of the elongated , sloping hb , they remarked that  at least qualitatively , a spread in metallicity might be an appealing explanation for the anomalous hb and for the spread in the rgb . \" the rrc stars in the cluster do appear to give some support to their hypothesis .",
    "while detailed calculations are needed to verify this possibility ( sweigart 2001 ) , we also note that :    \\i ) given the ngc  6441 hb number counts ( zoccali 1999 , private communication ) , the rrl and blue hb components comprise only @xmath129 of the total hb population of ngc  6441 . therefore , if these hb components are the progeny of metal - poor rgb stars in the cluster , only a similar small fraction of metal - poor rgb stars should be present in ngc  6441 ( and similarly in ngc  6388 ) . such a metal - poor component could presumably be fairly easily  hidden \" behind the differential reddening that is present in the cluster ( e.g. , layden et al .",
    "1999 ) ;    \\ii ) since the number ratio of rrc to rrab stars in ngc  6441 is more typical of oosterhoff type ii than oosterhoff type i clusters , one might think that the usual  evolutionary mechanism \" invoked to account for the c / ab number ratios ( van albada & baker 1973 ) could be at play in this cluster as well , implying that the ngc  6441 rrl variables evolve from blue to red in the cmd .",
    "redward evolution for stars crossing the instability strip is thought to be a likely characteristic of metal - poor globular clusters with primarily blue hb s ( e.g. , lee , demarque , & zinn 1990 ) , which might also imply that the blue hb plus rrl component in ngc  6441 is metal - poor ;    \\iii ) clement ( 2000 ) , adopting a strict selection criterion to include only rrab variables with  regular \" light curves ( jurcsik & kovcs 1996 ) , found that the ngc  6441 rrab stars occupy a location in the oosterhoff type ii systems ( see also fig .  7 ) .",
    "pritzl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and our updated figure 10 , show the rrab stars in ngc  6441 to be at least as long in period at a given amplitude as the rrab stars in typical oosterhoff type ii systems .",
    "that might suggest that the ngc  6441 rrab stars are metal - poor , given that the most metal - rich oosterhoff type ii systems known have @xmath61 } \\simeq -1.6 $ ] ( ortolani et al . 2000 ) ;    \\iv ) moehler , sweigart , & catelan ( 1999 ) have shown that the gravities of the blue - hb stars in ngc  6441 ( and ngc  6388 ) are not consistent with the predictions based on the non - canonical scenarios proposed by sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , their measured gravities are not clearly inconsistent with canonical , metal - poor models .",
    "hence it appears that the piotto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) conjecture that a spread in metallicity would be qualitatively consistent with the anomalous hb of ngc  6441 is supported by some of the currently available data for the rrl variables and blue - hb stars in the cluster .",
    "but can a spread in metallicity lead to a sloping hb as seen in the cluster as well ?    apparently , yes . if we assume , as is currently believed , that the mean slope of the @xmath130}$ ] relation is in the range @xmath131 , and if the more metal - rich component ( i.e. , the bulk ) of the cluster has @xmath61 } \\approx -0.5 $ ]  dex , this would imply that the more metal - poor component of the cluster would have a metallicity of the order @xmath61 } \\approx -2.2 \\rightarrow -3.0 $ ]  dex .",
    "while this may seem somewhat too low , there are several effects which may , at least in principle , contribute to the production of an hb slope and hence alleviate somewhat the constraints on the metallicity of the metal - poor component , such as : a )  an increase in the slope of the @xmath130}$ ] relation for @xmath61 } > -1 $ ] ( e.g. , castellani , chieffi , & pulone 1991 ) ; b )  helium mixing and/or an increase in the core mass at the helium flash for the more metal - poor components ( sweigart 1997 ) ; c )  evolution away from a blue , metal - poor zero - age hb , which might make any evolved metal - poor rrl stars brighter than the  mean \" @xmath130}$ ] relation ( e.g. , lee & carney 1999 ) ; d )  a  canonical slope \" of the zero - age hb ( brocato et al .",
    "1999 ) , which , though small ( @xmath132  mag ) , would contribute to producing a sloping hb ; e )  differential reddening , which is clearly present in the field of the cluster (  4.5 ; layden et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "these arguments are obviously of a qualitative nature .",
    "however , sweigart ( 2001 ) has recently carried out stellar evolution calculations to explore this metallicity - spread scenario in more detail .",
    "these evolutionary models show that a spread in metallicty can naturally lead to an upward sloping hb under the simple assumptions that all of the stars are coeval and that the mass loss efficiency , as measured by the reimers ( 1975 ) mass loss parameter , is independent of [ fe / h ] .",
    "moreover the size of the predicted hb slope is close to that observed in ngc  6441 .",
    "however , among the issues that still need to be addressed , we highlight the following possible caveats :    \\i ) why are ngc  6441 and @xmath9  cen able to produce long - period rrc variables , which seem to be extremely rare in single - metallicity globular clusters ( see  5.4 ) ? can this be somehow related to the extreme deep mixing signatures which have been identified in @xmath9  cen ( norris & da costa 1995a , 1995b ) ? obviously , abundance measurements are badly needed for both the red giants and hb stars in ngc  6441 ( and ngc  6388 ) ;    \\ii ) is the hb luminosity function of ngc  6441 consistent with a sloping hb caused by a metallicity sequence , with mean metallicity decreasing with bluer colors ?",
    "since at any given metallicity globular cluster hbs show a large spread in color , a superposition of  template \" hbs of globular clusters of different metallicity ( e.g. , 47  tuc at the metal - rich end , ngc  362 , m3 , m2 , m15 , all the way down to ngc  5053 at the most metal - poor end ) would certainly not lead to a  tight \" sloping hb , but instead to a large color / luminosity scatter at any given luminosity / color ;    \\iii ) following the same reasoning as above , the rrl population might also be expected to have contributions from several different metallicity values .",
    "would this be consistent with the overall brightness of the ngc  6441 rrl ? how would this be reconciled with the fairly tight period - amplitude distribution of the cluster stars ?",
    "\\iv ) what is the connection between the bright ngc  6441 rrl stars and v9 in 47  tuc ? while a correlation between position on the hb and mixing signatures has been clearly demonstrated in the case of 47  tuc ( briley 1997 ) , a spread in metallicity appears rather unlikely for this cluster ( suntzeff 1993 ) . as a matter of fact , v9 itself has been conclusively shown to be only moderately metal - deficient ( keith & butler 1980 ; smith 1984 ) , with a metal abundance consistent with that of 47  tuc ;    \\v ) if the rrl in ngc  6441 are indeed very metal poor , one would expect them to be more massive than those in oosterhoff type i clusters ( e.g. , sandage 1993 and references therein ) . however , our derived rrc masses (  5.1 ) are very low  even lower than those derived using the same method for oosterhoff i globular clusters such as m3 , m5 , ngc  6171 ( cf . table  3 in kaluzny et al .",
    "2000 , and table  4 in clement & rowe 2000 ) and ngc  6229 ( borissova , catelan , & valchev 2001 ) .",
    "can this trend be reconciled with the  metal - poor \" scenario ? on the other hand , recent work by sohn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) has shown that the rrc masses derived using this method appear to be very low for the @xmath61 } \\simeq -2 $ ] , oosterhoff ii cluster m53 ( ngc  5024 ) .",
    "it has been shown throughout this paper , along with the discussion in pritzl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , that the classification of ngc 6441 into one or the other of the usual oosterhoff groups is difficult .",
    "the long periods of the rrab stars and the relatively large proportion of c type pulsators are more typical of oosterhoff ii than oosterhoff i systems , though we again note that @xmath133 is unusually large even for oosterhoff ii .",
    "in contrast , the mean luminosity of the ngc 6441 rrc stars as found by applying the simon & clement ( 1993a , 1993b ) method ( see  5.1 ) is consistent with values found in oosterhoff i clusters such as m3 .",
    "this is in conflict with our assertion that the rrl are unusually bright ( see  5.3 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows that the ngc  6441 rrab stars do appear to fall along the line in the period - amplitude diagram for rrab stars in oosterhoff ii clusters , as given by clement & shelton ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , using a somewhat different sample of comparison stars , we find in figure  10 that the ngc  6441 stars tend to have slightly longer periods at a given amplitude than the bulk of the rrab stars in the oosterhoff ii clusters m15 and m68 .    the mere fact that ngc 6441 has a blue extension to its hb that extends through the instability strip makes it unusual when compared to other metal - rich globular clusters",
    ". it may be the case that rrl that form in metal - rich globular clusters exhibit different properties than metal - rich stars that form in the field .",
    "as shown in figure 10 , v9 in 47 tuc falls in the same region of the period - amplitude diagram as the rrab in ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 .",
    "recently , a rrab star was found in the metal - rich cluster terzan 5 ( edmonds et al .",
    "while its period ( @xmath1340.61 d ) is shorter than the average periods of the rrab in ngc 6441 and ngc 6388 and v9 in 47 tuc , it is longer than field stars of similar metallicities .",
    "these examples ( see also layden 1995 , esp . his fig .",
    "1 ) all illustrate that these clusters may be exceptions to the oosterhoff classification scheme and to the usual correlation of rrl properties with metallicity among field rrl .",
    "ngc  6441 stands out as one of the more unique globular clusters of our galaxy .",
    "ngc  6441 is confirmed to be a metal - rich globular cluster exhibiting an unusual horizontal branch morphology .",
    "a strong red component of the horizontal branch is seen , as is expected for a cluster in this metallicity range .",
    "in addition to the red clump , the cluster has a blue horizontal branch extending through the instability strip which is not found in other clusters of similar metallicities except for ngc  6388 , i.e. , ngc  6441 exhibits a second - parameter effect .",
    "the explanations of such an effect may be constrained by the sloped nature of the horizontal branch , getting brighter in @xmath4 with decreasing @xmath8 , as sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) suggested .",
    "it is also possible that ngc  6441 may have a spread in its metallicity making it analogous to @xmath9 centauri , in which case its classification as a ",
    "second - parameter cluster \" may not be strictly applicable , although this remains to be established .",
    "the number of known rr lyrae stars in the ngc  6441 field has been increased to 46 . as predicted by sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) ,",
    "the periods of the rr lyrae are unusually long for a cluster of its metallicity , a result confirmed and extended in the period - amplitude diagram comparing ngc  6441 to other globular clusters .",
    "a few long period rrc stars were also found to exist in the cluster , resulting in a smaller than expected gap between the longest period rrc and the shortest period rrab stars .",
    "such long - period rrc s are extremely rare among globular clusters , with the notable exception of @xmath9  centauri .",
    "ngc  6441 was found to contain a number of fundamental mode rr lyrae that are both brighter and redder than the other probable rrab found along the horizontal branch .",
    "this effect is likely due to blending with unresolved red companion stars .",
    "the reddening determined for ngc  6441 is @xmath135  mag with significant differential reddening across the cluster . from the rr lyrae in the cluster ,",
    "excluding the brighter and redder rrab stars , the mean @xmath4 magnitude of the horizontal branch was determined to be @xmath5  mag leading to a range in distance of 10.4 to 11.9  kpc .",
    "ngc  6441 was shown to stand apart from other galactic globular clusters in that it does not fit in the oosterhoff classification scheme .",
    "the mean periods of the rrab in the cluster are as long as or even longer than the typical , more metal - poor , oosterhoff type ii clusters .",
    "this contradiction in the trend of increasing period with decreasing metallicity , for a given amplitude , implies that the metallicity - luminosity relationship for rr lyrae stars is not universal  if , in fact , the rr lyrae stars in ngc  6441 do share the cluster s relatively high overall metallicity .",

    "<S> the total number of variables found near ngc  6441 has been increased to @xmath1 , with 48 new variables being found in this survey . a significant number of the variables are rr lyrae stars ( @xmath2 ) , most of which are probable cluster members . as was noted by layden et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1999 ) , the periods of the fundamental mode rr lyrae are unusually long compared to field stars of similar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these long period rrab stars is consistent with sweigart & catelan s ( 1998 ) prediction that the horizontal branch of ngc  6441 is unusually bright . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that the metallicity - luminosity relationship for rr lyrae stars is not universal . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the difficulty in determining the oosterhoff classification of ngc  6441 due to the unusual nature of its rr lyrae . </S>",
    "<S> a number of ab - type rr lyrae are found to be both brighter and redder than the other probable rrab found along the horizontal branch , which may be a result of blending with stars of redder color . </S>",
    "<S> a smaller than usual gap is found between the shortest period fundamental mode and the longest period first - overtone mode rr lyrae . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the reddening of the cluster to be @xmath3  mag , with substantial differential reddening across the face of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the mean @xmath4 magnitude of the rr lyrae is found to be @xmath5 mag resulting in a distance of 10.4 to 11.9  kpc , for a range of assumed values of @xmath6 for rr lyrae stars . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that stars in ngc  6441 may span a range in [ fe / h ] is also discussed . </S>"
