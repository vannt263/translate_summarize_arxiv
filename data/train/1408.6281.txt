    ", the nuclear matter case could be interesting for finite nuclear systems where neutron - proton pairing is relevant @xcite , even if the appearance of pairing in ordinary uniform matter is probably questionable because of known instabilities @xcite which could hide superfluidity in a broad range of densities .",

    "the first steps towards a realistic nn potential from first principles started almost twenty years ago within the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "in chpt the nuclear potential emerges naturally as a hierarchy of terms controlled by a power expansion in @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a soft scale ( pion mass , nucleon momentum ) and @xmath12 is a hard scale ( the nucleon mass @xmath13 or the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath14 ) .",

    "two different methods for evolving nuclear potentials to block- and band - diagonal form in a momentum - space representation , @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , have been developed ( see refs .",

    "an alternative approach would be to construct from the beginning chiral nuclear potentials at lower cutoff scales @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ secii ] introduces the bcs theory that is the standard framework for a microscopic description of nucleonic pairing .",
    "in particular , the numerical implementation first introduced by khodel _",
    "@xcite will be reviewed .",
    "sections [ 1s0_sec ] and [ hpw_sec ] describe , respectively , our predictions for pairing gaps in the singlet and in the coupled channel cases .",
    "the role of the two - body nn interaction will be discussed along with the influence of three - body forces and self - energy effects .",
    "finally , section [ seciv ] presents our conclusions .",
    "in this section we explain the method employed to solve the bcs equations @xcite by partial - wave decomposition @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we largely neglect spin and isospin degrees of freedom in the derivation .",
    "the bcs equation reads in terms of the nn potential @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 with @xmath22 and where @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the single - particle energy and @xmath25 is the chemical potential . as in @xcite",
    ", we decompose the interaction @xmath26 and the gap function @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the spherical harmonics , @xmath29 is the orbital angular momentum , @xmath30 is its projection along the @xmath31 axis and @xmath32 refers to the legendre polynomials . after performing an angle - average approximation ( we do not retain the @xmath30-dependence , anisotropic pairing gaps @xcite will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ) we have the following equation for any value of @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 refers to the total angular momentum ( @xmath37 ) quantum number including spin @xmath38 and now @xmath39 .",
    "gaps with different @xmath33 and @xmath36 are coupled due to the energy denominator but , for the sake of simplicity , we assume that different components of the interaction mainly act on non - overlapping intervals in density .",
    "this assumption will turn out to be correct in the neutron matter case while only partially justified when treating gaps for symmetric nuclear matter . to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : aagap ] ) , we follow the approach suggested by khodel _",
    "_ @xcite that has been proven to be stable even for small values of the gap and to require only the initial assumption of a scale factor @xmath40 ( results , of course , will be @xmath40-independent ) .",

    "[ fig : meff ] we plot the effective masses for nuclear and neutron matter as functions of density . from the effective mass behavior",
    "we can expect that the self - energy effects will play a central role in the high - density components of the gap , while at low densities the effects will be rather negligible .",
    "second - order perturbative contributions to the single - particle energies are expected to increase the effective mass @xcite .",
    "in the singlet channel , the only difference between the @xmath73 and @xmath74 potential is the charge independence breaking and the charge symmetry breaking terms , which are treated as small perturbations in chpt . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0npbcs ] we test our solution to the gap equation , in the nuclear matter case , against previously published results @xcite with the low - momentum interaction @xmath18 . in addition , we compute the @xmath72 gap from the bare chiral nn interaction and find a qualitatively very similar behavior .",
    "the gap @xmath0 reaches a maximum value of approximately 3.5 mev at @xmath75@xmath76 when the bare interaction is used in the two - body sector , while a somewhat reduced gap ( by almost @xmath77 mev ) if we consider @xmath18 .    in the neutron matter case ,",
    "at the two - body level , there is good agreement with the gap computed from well known realistic potentials like the cd - bonn or nijmegen interactions @xcite , but at larger densities the n3lo gap exhibits a higher value .",

    "we observe that at low densities the gap behaviors are very similar , but beyond fermi momenta of @xmath80 the gaps computed with the argonne potentials decrease rapidly in contrast to those from chiral interactions . at the present time",
    ", it is hard to assess if disagreement is due to different choices in the nuclear hamiltonian or different many - body methods .",
    "it is useful to consider separately the different physical effects governing the @xmath81 pairing gap . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0nnbcs_contr ] we plot the gaps obtained with two - body interactions alone ( the dotted lines represent the bare and the renormalized n3lo potentials ) , with the inclusion of effective three - body forces ( dashed lines ) and considering also self - energy effects ( solid lines ) .    by construction , we expect that at low densities the three - body effects are rather small , while only at higher densities do they become appreciable .",
    "the main role of both three - body forces and the effective mass is to substantially reduce the attractive strength in the @xmath6 channel ( for higher partial waves the situation is more involved , see sect .",
    "[ hpw_sec ] ) .",
    "in addition to the @xmath72 channel , in the nuclear matter case a non - vanishing gap appears in the @xmath83 channel .",
    "the presence of a bound state in this channel and the very high phase shifts in the @xmath84 channel indicate that the interaction is more attractive than in the other channels . as a consequence",
    "the gap has a magnitude of about 10 mev , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap3s1bcs ] , with conventional realistic potentials .",

    "- a @xcite is a complete one - boson exchange potential , opeg @xcite contains only the one - pion exchange tail and a gaussian repulsive core .",
    "the combined effect of three - body forces and self - energy effects leads not only to a sizable reduction of the gap itself but also to a shift of the gap s maximum at @xmath85 and a rapid decrease at higher fermi momenta .    due to the large densities over which the pairing gap remains finite",
    ", it is questionable whether low - momentum interactions , @xmath18 , with a block - diagonal momentum - space cutoff on the order of @xmath86@xmath76 are appropriate .",
    "a better approach is provided by the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) , where off - diagonal momentum - space matrix elements are supressed . in this case , we study nuclear hamiltonians @xmath87 evolved through the srg procedure @xcite , where we define a class of hamiltonians @xmath88 with a generator @xmath89 if we choose @xmath90 $ ] the flow equation takes the form @xmath91 , h_s\\right ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] as shown in @xcite , results obtained from srg - evolved interactions are very similar to those obtained from @xmath92 if an appropriate @xmath93 is chosen . moreover , the srg interaction has many salient features of low - momentum interactions , such as independence of the physical observables from the operator @xmath93 , perturbativeness and universality . in the literature",
    "it is common to encounter also the dimensional parameter @xmath94 @xmath76 .",
    "a very interesting feature of the srg procedure is that the tensor interaction strength is reduced as @xmath95 increases , and this modification to the interaction can strongly modify the @xmath82 gap .",
    "since all physical observables should remain unchanged under an srg transformation , this variation represents an uncertainty estimate in the pairing strength .",
    "a common choice for @xmath93 is @xmath96 , and in this case as @xmath95 increases , @xmath97 approaches the diagonal form .",
