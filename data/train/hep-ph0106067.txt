    "radiative @xmath0 meson decays are interesting because they proceed entirely through loop effects .",
    "the chiral nature of weak interactions implies additional suppression factors thus enhancing the sensitivity of radiative decays to virtual effects in theories beyond the standard theory of flavour violation , if these new effects violate chirality .",
    "the observation of @xmath4 transitions @xcite with a branching ratio of about @xmath5 ( in agreement with the standard theory ) has since provided significant constraints on extensions of the standard model .",
    "the semi - leptonic decay @xmath6 is expected to occur with a branching fraction of a few times @xmath7 and will probably be first observed in the near future .",
    "radiative flavour - changing neutral current transitions can be measured inclusively over the hadronic final state ( containing strangeness in the particular case considered here ) or exclusively by tagging a particular light hadron , typically a kaon .",
    "the inclusive measurement is experimentally more difficult but theoretically simpler to interpret , since the decay rate is well and systematically approximated by the decay of a free @xmath8 quark into light quarks and gluons . in the long run , however , the easier detection of exclusive transitions requires the development of a systematic theoretical framework for these modes as well .    the theoretical difficulty with exclusive decay modes is usually phrased as the need to know the hadronic form factors for the @xmath9 transition , but this is only one aspect of the problem .",
    "even if the form factors were known with infinite precision , the present treatment of exclusive , radiative decays would be incomplete , because there exist `` non - factorizable '' strong interaction effects that do not correspond to form factors .",
    "they arise from electromagnetic corrections to the matrix elements of purely hadronic operators in the weak effective hamiltonian .",
    "we compute these non - factorizable corrections in this paper and demonstrate that exclusive , radiative decays can be treated in a similarly systematic manner as their inclusive counterparts . as a result we obtain the branching fractions for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for small invariant mass of the lepton pair to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) order in renormalization - group - improved perturbation theory .",
    "( in another commonly used terminology that takes into account the @xmath12 enhancement of the semileptonic operator @xmath13 the result would be referred to as next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic . however , in order not to have to distinguish in terminology the photonic and semileptonic decay , we shall refer to both as nll when actually nnll is meant for the semileptonic decay . furthermore , since some of the 3-loop anomalous dimensions required for the semileptonic decay are still not computed , the accuracy is not strictly nnll . )",
    "our method draws heavily on methods developed recently for other exclusive @xmath0 decays . in @xcite",
    "power counting in the heavy quark mass limit and standard factorization arguments for hard strong interaction processes have been used to demonstrate that decay amplitudes for hadronic two - body decays of @xmath0 mesons can be systematically computed in terms of form factors , light - cone distribution amplitudes and perturbative hard scattering kernels .",
    "a similar reasoning has been applied by two of us @xcite to hadronic form factors for @xmath0 decays into light mesons in the kinematic region of large recoil of the light meson .",
    "we also noted that a combination of the work on non - leptonic decays and on form factors could be used to compute non - factorizable corrections to radiative decay amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , the ten different form factors that exclusive decays may depend on can be reduced to only three @xcite . more precisely ( but still schematically ) , the amplitude can be represented as @xmath14 where @xmath15 refers to a transversely and longitudinally polarized @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "the factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are calculable in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory .",
    "previous treatments of exclusive radiative decays correspond to evaluating ( [ factform ] ) to leading logarithmic accuracy ( up to a weak annihilation contribution as we discuss below ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is to show that systematic improvement is possible and to extend the accuracy to the next order . in section  [ sec : nonfact ]",
    "we present the result of the calculation . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we first discuss the inputs to our numerical result , such as wilson coefficients and meson parameters .",
    "we then analyse the stability of the result with respect to the input parameters and a variation of the renormalization scale .",
    "the phenomenological analysis is given in the subsequent two sections .",
    "section  [ sec : gamma ] is devoted to @xmath10 ; section  [ sec : ll ] to @xmath11 .",
    "we focus in particular on corrections to the forward - backward asymmetry , which is independent on the form factors @xmath17 to first approximation . in the final section  [ sec : final ]",
    "we discuss power corrections related to photon structure on a qualitative level and summarize our conclusions .",
    "we generally neglect doubly cabibbo - suppressed contributions to the decay amplitude . the weak effective hamiltonian is then given by @xmath21 and we use the operator basis introduced in @xcite for the operators @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "( more precisely , due to the normalization of ( [ heff ] ) , @xmath24 with @xmath25 defined in @xcite . )",

    "the linear combinations are chosen such that the @xmath40 coincide _ at leading logarithmic order _ with the wilson coefficients in the standard basis @xcite .",
    "as for form factors and non - leptonic two - body decays there exist two distinct classes of non - factorizable effects .",
    "( by `` non - factorizable '' we mean all those corrections that are not contained in the definition of the qcd form factors for heavy - to - light transitions .",
    "for example , the familiar leading - order diagrams shown in ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ fig2 ] are factorizable . )",
    "the first class involves diagrams in which the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson participates in the hard scattering .",
    "this effect occurs at leading order in an expansion in the strong coupling constant only through a weak annihilation diagram [ figure  [ fig2]c ] .",
    "the relevant diagrams at next - to - leading order are shown as ( a ) and ( b ) in figure  [ fig1 ] below and in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "they contribute at order @xmath42 to the functions @xmath20 in ( [ factform ] ) .",
    "diagrams of this form have already been considered ( for @xmath43 ) in @xcite .",
    "however , bound state model wave - functions ( rather than light - cone distribution amplitudes ) were used and no attempt was made to systematically expand the hard scattering amplitude in @xmath44 . as a consequence , the result of @xcite for @xmath45 depends on an infrared cut - off .",
    "this difficulty is resolved in the present factorization approach .",
    "the second class contains all diagrams shown in the second row of figure  [ fig1 ] below . here",
    "the spectator quark is connected to the hard process represented by the diagram only through soft interactions .",
    "the result is therefore proportional to the form factor @xmath17 and the hard - scattering part gives an @xmath46-correction to the functions @xmath19 in ( [ factform ] ) .    in this section we present the results of the calculation of these diagrams .",
    "some of the results needed for diagrams of the second class can be extracted from work on inclusive radiative decays @xcite and we have made use of these results as indicated below .",
    "the conventions for the form factors and light - cone distribution amplitudes for @xmath0 mesons and light mesons are those of @xcite .",
    "since the matrix elements of the semi - leptonic operators @xmath47 can be expressed through @xmath48 form factors , non - factorizable corrections contribute to the decay amplitude only through the production of a virtual photon , which then decays into the lepton pair .",

    "this is in contrast to the discussion in @xcite , where , using the same convention for the outgoing meson , the hard - scattering amplitude depended only on the plus component of the spectator quark momentum . as a consequence the @xmath0 meson distribution amplitude @xmath87 now appears as coefficient of @xmath88 in the @xmath0 meson projector . except for this difference",

    "both contributions are numerically small relative to the dominant leading - order terms .",
    "note that since @xmath92 does not contribute to the decay amplitude in the limit @xmath93 , there is no weak annihilation contribution to @xmath10 at leading order in @xmath46 _ and _ at leading order in @xmath44 .",

    "we therefore conclude that the explanation must be sought in our understanding of qcd effects .",
    "most of the nlo enhancement is related to the non - factorizable form factor type correction which appears in a nearly identical form in the inclusive decay rate as well .",
    "hence this enhancement can not be simply dismissed without putting the agreement for the inclusive decay into question .",
    "a second and less interesting possibility is therefore to invoke a large @xmath44 correction that would render our calculation unreliable . given the smallness of the non - factorizable hard scattering correction it is not obvious how such a large dynamical enhancement of @xmath44 terms could be explained .",
    "this is in particular so as large @xmath44 corrections known to exist for non - leptonic decays @xcite such as `` chirally enhanced '' corrections and large weak annihilation contributions are absent for decays into vector mesons .",

    "the numerical effect of nlo corrections amounts to a substantial reduction of the fb asymmetry for intermediate lepton invariant mass ( @xmath390  gev@xmath389 ) and a significant shift of the location of the asymmetry zero to @xmath391 the largest single uncertainty ( about @xmath392 ) continues to be scale dependence ( varying @xmath393 within @xmath394 as usual ) , but also the variation of @xmath31 , @xmath302 , and @xmath270 gives an effect .",
    "our lo result for @xmath315 differs somewhat from the value @xmath395 quoted in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference is a combination of three effects : ( i ) slightly different values for the sm wilson coefficients , in particular a larger value for @xmath3 in @xcite , ( ii ) a different treatment of the @xmath8-quark mass , ( iii ) the inclusion of ( higher - order factorizable ) form factor corrections in @xcite , since the full qcd form factors estimated from light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite are used .",
    "the first two issues are resolved within the present next - to - leading order treatment but with respect to ( iii ) we note that the form factor ratios entering @xmath145 are exactly those where there exists a discrepancy between the qcd sum rule result and the heavy quark limit @xcite . the origin of this discrepancy has not been clarified , but it is conceivable that it is related to some @xmath396 corrections , which are implicitly included in the sum rule estimate . in order to estimate the impact of using full qcd form factors on the location of the asymmetry zero , we reabsorb the factorizable @xmath46 corrections into the physical form factors and the @xmath30 mass . the fb asymmetry then reads ( with the tensor form factors and the @xmath30 mass @xmath397 all renormalized at the scale @xmath393 ) @xmath398 & & \\times \\mbox{re } \\bigg[\\left ( c_9 +   y(q^2 )          + \\frac{\\alpha_s c_f}{4\\pi } \\,c_\\perp^{(\\rm",

    "if furthermore the latter ratio is expanded in @xmath46 and if some terms of order @xmath405 are neglected , we return to the next - to - leading order result that we use by default . on the basis of ( [ fbnew ] ) and the form factor estimates from @xcite , we now obtain @xmath406  gev@xmath389 at lo and @xmath407  gev@xmath389 at nlo .",
    "( to obtain this result we use @xmath32 as input and treat perturbatively the difference with @xmath337 . )",
    "the nlo value is slightly more than one `` standard deviation '' away from our default result in ( [ q0estimate ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two values could be viewed as an estimate for an additional systematic error , but the main conclusion is that using the soft form factors or the full qcd form factors from light - cone qcd sum rules does not cause a large ambiguity in our result for @xmath315 .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath408 to be a conservative estimate for the asymmetry zero .",
    "the wilson coefficients may also receive contributions from new particles in theories beyond the standard model .",
    "( of course extensions of the standard model may introduce a larger set of operators as well . ) the function @xmath145 depends dominantly on @xmath3 and @xmath151 ( see ( [ cc9 t ] ) ) .",
    "the experimental measurement of the decay rate for the inclusive decay @xmath409 already constrains @xmath410 to be close to its standard model value .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry will establish the sign of @xmath151 and assuming this to take its standard model value , a measurement of the fb asymmetry zero in the decay @xmath411 provides a way to determine @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore instructive to consider our result as a prediction for @xmath3 for a given value of @xmath315 that will be measured in future experiments . in figure",
    "[ fig : c9exp ] we show our nlo prediction for @xmath3 at the scale @xmath412  gev as a function of @xmath315 together with the standard model prediction ( see section  [ input_sec ] ) . for comparison",
    "we also show the lo result and the modification arising from using ( [ fbnew ] ) instead of ( [ dgamma ] ) .",
    "we remark that @xmath3 is scheme - dependent and so the plot refers to the particular renormalization scheme for @xmath13 adopted in @xcite .",
    "0.3 cm    figure  [ fig : c9exp ] is our main phenomenological result .",
    "it illustrates that the fb asymmetry zero can be used to test the standard model and to search for extensions , since the theoretical uncertainties relevant for the determination of @xmath3 are under control . in this respect",
    "the systematic inclusion of nlo corrections , which is provided in this work , turns out to be essential , because it reduces the renormalization scale and scheme dependences to a large extent and corrects the leading - order result by a large amount .",
    "we emphasize that in contrast to the absolute rates for @xmath413 and @xmath414 the dependence on the @xmath415 form factors is sub - leading for the fb asymmetry zero .",
    "thus the current difficulty to account for the @xmath413 branching ratio ( which may suggest a smaller value of the form factor @xmath416 than usually estimated from qcd sum rules as discussed above ) , does not necessarily cause a problem for our prediction of @xmath3 vs.  @xmath315 .",
    "we also note that the resulting values of @xmath315 are sufficiently below the threshold for charmonium resonances ( @xmath417 , @xmath418 ) , so that a long - distance contribution to the function @xmath123 can safely be neglected .",
    "we therefore conclude that if the asymmetry zero is found at some @xmath419 , the short - distance coefficient @xmath420 can be determined with a theoretical error of @xmath421 .",
    "if its value turns out to be different from the standard model value @xmath422 by an amount @xmath423 and if we assume that all wilson coefficients other than @xmath424 remain unmodified at the scale @xmath200 , then ( [ rgesol2 ] ) below implies a new contribution of magnitude @xmath423 to the coefficient function @xmath3 at the scale @xmath200 .",
    "building on our previous work on heavy - to - light form factors @xcite and on work on non - leptonic decays @xcite , we demonstrated that also the radiative @xmath0 decays @xmath425 and @xmath426 can be computed in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "this allows us to solve the problem of non - factorizable strong interaction corrections ( i.e.  those corrections not related to form factors ) , which has so far prevented a systematic discussion of exclusive radiative decays , as compared to their inclusive analogues .",
    "the approach presented here does not circumvent the need to know the heavy - to - light form factors , but we may hope that progress in lattice qcd will give us these form factors at smaller @xmath95 and more reliably than at present in the longer term future .    in the present paper we have concentrated on the @xmath98 transition .",
    "we noted that the next - to - leading order correction yields an @xmath427 enhancement of the @xmath10 decay rate , a large part of which is related to the nlo correction that appears also in the inclusive decay @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is so large that the predicted decay rate disagrees with the observed decay rate unless the form factors at @xmath43 are much smaller than what they are believed to be , or unless our theoretical prediction is made unreliable by a large correction to the heavy quark limit .",
    "perhaps the most interesting outcome of our analysis is that while the nlo correction to the lepton invariant mass spectrum in @xmath11 is very small , there is a large correction to the predicted location of the forward - backward asymmetry zero .",
    "the particular interest in this quantity derives from the fact that all dependence of form factors arises first at next - to - leading order .",
    "this implies that ( given the wilson coefficient @xmath428 ) the wilson coefficient @xmath3 can be determined from a measurement of the location of the asymmetry zero with little theoretical uncertainty .",
    "we find that this conclusion holds true in particular after including the nlo correction , which however , shifts the predicted location of the zero by @xmath429 , or about @xmath306 , with a residual uncertainty estimated to be about @xmath430 .",
    "this implies that an accurate measurement of the asymmetry zero determines the wilson coefficient @xmath3 at the scale @xmath31 with an error of @xmath421 .",
    "the method developed here can also be applied to @xmath97 transitions .",
    "these are particularly interesting in the search for modifications of the standard model . the better control of standard model effects after accounting for non - factorizable corrections should help increasing the sensitivity to such non - standard effects . in particular we note that the approach presented here allows us to compute isospin breaking effects , which may turn out to be a particularly nice signal of non - standard physics .",
    "a detailed discussion of @xmath97 transitions requires , however , a more careful study of weak annihilation effects , and we plan to return to non - standard physics in the context of such a study @xcite",
    ".    a systematic , but rather difficult to quantify , limitation of the factorization approach is the poor control of @xmath44 suppressed effects .",
    "these arise from various sources and we conclude by mentioning one of them .",
    "we may ask to what extent a non - leptonic decay @xmath431 in which the @xmath432 meson is assumed to convert to a photon through vector meson dominance may affect our calculation of the direct decay into @xmath433 .",
    "more accurately , the question is to what extent the hadronic structure of the photon matters at small @xmath95 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the indirect contribution is suppressed by one power of @xmath31 in the heavy quark limit . for the sake of the argument we return to the vector dominance picture and note that there is",
    "a one - to - one correspondence between diagrams that appear in the factorization approach to non - leptonic decays @xcite and the diagrams computed here .",
    "for example , the naive factorization contribution to the former case corresponds to our leading order weak annihilation term ; the spectator scattering contribution to non - leptonic decays corresponds to the diagram in figure  [ fig1]b with the photon attached to the internal quark loop and so on .",
    "counting powers of @xmath31 for all the quantities that appear in these amplitudes we find that the direct amplitude is always larger by a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "we would like to thank c.  greub and m.  walker for helpful discussions .",
    "while this work has been done , we became aware of related work in @xcite .",
    "we thank g.  buchalla for discussing the results of this paper prior to publication .      while completing this work , the article  @xcite appeared , in which the next - to - leading order hard - scattering correction to @xmath434 is calculated .",
    "the corresponding quantity should be obtained from the function @xmath435 in ( [ tnfperp ] ) in the limit @xmath262 .",
    "the small qcd penguin contributions have been neglected in @xcite , so that only the terms proportional to @xmath167 and @xmath139 have to be retained for the comparison .",
    "the charm quark mass in @xmath436 is set to 0 in @xcite , presumably because an endpoint divergence is found for @xmath437 .",
    "we note that our result does not exhibit this endpoint divergence ( which would invalidate the factorization approach ) , but setting @xmath438 for the sake of comparison , we obtain @xmath439 we then differ from ( 4.12 ) of @xcite by a sign in the first term and a factor of @xmath440 in the second term .",
    "we also note that @xcite includes a factorizable form factor correction from @xcite while retaining the full qcd form factor @xmath416 .",
    "this implies that the factorizable correction is included twice .",
    "we use the renormalization conventions of @xcite , but present our result in terms of the following linear combinations of wilson coefficients : @xmath441 these definitions hold to all orders in perturbation theory .",
