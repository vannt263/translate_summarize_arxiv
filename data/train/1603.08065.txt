    "the success of the model opened opportunity for testing other kinds of effects in oscillation experiments  @xcite .",

    "then , we conclude with a simple study about cp - violation where we show how the cp - violation phenomena may be changed depending on the magnitude of the decoherence effects .",
    "we introduce a dissipative formalism that may be used in long baseline experiments of the next generation like dune @xcite . in this context",

    "we can define another dissipator to violate the constraint before .",
    "it is made replacing the null entries in the main diagonal by new parameters in the dissipators ( [ iv ] ) and ( [ v ] ) .",

    "( [ xiv ] ) is clear that the new peaks are not expected for antineutrinos once this equation does not have a resonance behavior in this case .",

    "however , through this equation we can only see the action of the decoherence effects on the intrinsic and fake cp - violation as a whole .",
    "the matter effect can be lessened through the choice of the baseline , but it is not completely eliminated . in any approximation for neutrino propagation in matter , the matter potential is kept and these two types of cp - violation will be involved . then , only in approximate way we can see how the decoherence effects change the intrinsic cp - violation . for this end , we can use the following definition @xcite @xmath140 where we the matter effect is lessened as it is possible to see through the short approximate appearance probability in eq .",
    "( [ xxviii ] ) and so , we can see approximately how the intrinsic cp - violation is changed in fig .",
    "[ fig.cp]c . in this figure",
    ", the peak at the resonance region disappears and the decoherence effects decrease the amplitude oscillation of the @xmath141 .",
    "we have investigated from a phenomenological point view the dissipative effects in neutrino propagation considering long baseline experiments . in our discussion , we supposed a baseline of the dune experiment @xcite .",
    "this experiment will have greatest sensibility to many oscillation parameters . besides",
    ", it will be able to investigate the open questions in neutrinos physics and many non - standard models will be probed from this experiment @xcite .",
    "our approach included dissipative effects with a treatment where all quantum interpretations remain as usual .",
    "all dissipative effects were obtained from phenomenology arguments based in complete positivity constraint . from this",

    "it contains three possible decoherence parameters since the other two possible relaxation parameters are stringently bounded by solar neutrinos .",
    "these parameters are correlated by inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ viii ] ) where at least two decoherence parameters have to be non - null in order to remain the physical evolution .    due to the new effect introduced by combination between the msw and the dissipative effects",
    ", we made a study in two neutrino approximation to explain how the decoherence and relaxation effects react when the msw is present . in this case",
    ", we have shown that the decoherence and relaxation effects brought a different behaviors to the probabilities .",
    "these behaviors are evidenced trough the new up and down peaks at the resonance region .    for three neutrino oscillations",
    "was used the usual approximation where one assumes @xmath1 and we rewrite the important mixing coefficients in appendix a that was mapped in ref .",
    "so , we presented in analytical way two versions for the dissipative model obtained from the dissipator defined in eq .",

    "so , we can know the approximate behaviors of the survival and appearance probabilities in this case .",
    "these approximate probabilities and numerical solution have similar behaviors in most part of the energy spectrum as we can see in fig . [ figa ] .    in the second version ,",
    "only terms proportional to @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are kept in the probabilities . in these case , the addiction of the decoherence parameters become the probabilities divergent at the resonance region , but the eqs .",
    "( [ xxiv ] ) and ( [ xxviii ] ) are useful to understand the behaviors of the survival and appearance probabilities in the important range energy of the dune experiment .",
    "[ fig21 ] presented all decoherence parameters individually showing how each decoherence parameter may change the behavior of the probabilities . the parameters @xmath143 and @xmath119 are important in the appearance case while the @xmath117 is important in survival case .",
    "in particular , the dissipative and msw effect was investigated in detail in two neutrino oscillation where at the resonance region appears new peaks due to action of the both msw and dissipative effects . in three neutrino oscillation",
    "the peak due to decoherence effect appears too , but in this case , it is described by @xmath119 parameter .",
    "we finished this work showing the consequences of the decoherence effects on the cp - violation for specific angles where in an approximate way , we can distinguish the fake and intrinsic cp - violation case .",
    "as we have seen the decoherence effect tends to decrease the amplitude behavior of the cp - violation effects as it is possible to see in fig .",

    "so , we have shown how the decoherence effects may be a non - usual standard phenomena interesting to be investigated in next generation of neutrino experiments .",
    "new effects and behavior may be expected and their absences will be due to stringent limits on the decoherence effect .    the author thanks the gouvea , a. and the northwestern university where most part of this work was made and he thanks for the support of funding grants 2012/00857 - 6 and 2013/11651 - 2 so paulo research foundation ( fapesp ) .",
