    "the study of the quasar and agn populations has been transformed in recent years by ambitious new optical ( e.g. , @xcite ) , x - ray ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and radio ( e.g. , @xcite ) surveys , by the recognition that low efficiency accretion modes may become important when the accretion rate itself is low ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , by detailed studies of low luminosity agn in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and , perhaps most of all , by the accumulating evidence that supermassive black holes are ubiquitous in the bulges of present - day galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical studies of nearby galaxies strengthen the long - standing hypothesis that quasars are powered by black hole accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the `` demography '' of the local black hole population provides a powerful constraint on models of quasar evolution and its connection to galaxy evolution .",
    "these developments have inspired increasingly sophisticated theoretical models that place quasar evolution in the context of hierarchical clustering models for the formation of dark matter halos and galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this paper presents a physically motivated calculational framework that is intermediate in complexity between such _ ab initio _ models of the quasar population and older descriptions in terms of `` luminosity evolution '' or `` density evolution . ''",
    "the central actor in our formulation is the accretion probability distribution @xmath0 , the probability that a black hole of mass @xmath1 at redshift @xmath2 is accreting mass at a rate @xmath3 in eddington units ( discussed in  [ sec : framework ] below ) .",
    "the key supporting players are the black hole mass function @xmath4 and a physical model of accretion that predicts the radiative efficiency for a given @xmath3 . and refer only to @xmath11 or @xmath5 , but these should always be understood to refer to the distribution at some particular redshift . ]",
    "an example of an accretion model would be thin - disk accretion with efficiency @xmath12 when @xmath13 , changing to low efficiency advection - dominated ( adaf ) accretion when @xmath3 is below some critical value . at a given redshift , @xmath11 and @xmath5 together determine the quasar luminosity function , and @xmath11 also determines the accretion driven growth of the black hole population , and hence the evolution of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , given physical assumptions about radiative efficiencies and a `` boundary condition '' specifying @xmath5 at one redshift , the history of @xmath11 determines the complete evolution of the black hole population and the quasar luminosity function .",
    "an essential caveat is that mergers of black holes following mergers of their host galaxies could alter @xmath5 independently of the accretion characterized by @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest scenario connecting black hole and quasar evolution is that black holes `` shine as they grow '' : a luminous quasar is powered by a black hole radiating at near - eddington luminosity with efficiency @xmath14 , and no significant growth occurs in a non - luminous phase . in this case , the bolometric luminosity function at a given redshift is just @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ( universal ) ratio of eddington luminosity to black hole mass and @xmath17 is the fraction of black holes that are accreting . in a time interval @xmath18 ,",
    "black holes on average increase their mass by a factor @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath21-folding time for growth at the eddington luminosity ( @xcite ; see discussion in  [ sec : framework ] ) .",
    "the mass density in black holes at the present day is simply related to the emissivity of the quasar population integrated over luminosity and redshift , @xmath22 ( @xcite , updated by , e.g. , @xcite ) . in our language",
    ", this is a model in which all active black holes have the same radiative efficiency and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the dirac - delta function .",
    "the evolution of quasars and black holes is determined by a boundary condition on @xmath5 and the redshift history of the active fraction @xmath25 .",
    "the `` quasar era '' @xmath26 when the emissivity of the population peaks is also the era in which today s black holes grew to their current mass .",
    "this simple scenario may not be too far from the truth , but the possible complications raise a number of questions .",
    "did today s black holes gain a significant fraction of their mass through low-@xmath3 , low efficiency , adaf - type accretion , thus growing at low luminosity ?",
    "have black hole mergers substantially altered @xmath5 , leaving the integrated density @xmath27 fixed but changing the relative numbers of high and low mass black holes ? are some quasars accreting mass at super - eddington rates , radiating at high luminosity but low efficiency in `` smothered , '' optically thick adaf modes @xcite ?",
    "do some quasars radiate substantially above the eddington limit @xcite ? is a significant fraction of quasar activity obscured by gas and dust , as hypothesized in synthesis models of the x - ray background ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thus redistributing bolometric luminosity from the optical - uv - soft x - ray to the far - ir ?",
    "are low luminosity agns powered mainly by low mass black holes radiating at eddington luminosity , by more massive black holes with thin - disk efficiencies but sub - eddington accretion rates , or by still more massive black holes with sub - eddington accretion rates _ and _ low efficiency ?",
    "the methods developed here provide useful tools for addressing these questions , allowing us to construct concrete , quantitative models that answer them in different ways , then examine how observational data might distinguish among such models .",
    "our framework complements , but by no means replaces , the _ ab initio _ approach that connects the evolution of quasars and black holes to that of the underlying dark halo and galaxy populations .",
    "this approach has yielded many valuable insights , including the recognition that the rise of the quasar population probably traces the formation of the first dark halos large enough to host massive black holes , that the rapid decline of the population at low redshift probably reflects the combined impact of declining galaxy interaction rates and decreasing gas supplies in quasar hosts , and that the clustering of quasars with themselves or with galaxies can provide a valuable diagnostic of typical quasar lifetimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in combination with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation",
    ", these quasar evolution models can also predict the properties and environments of quasar hosts and the relation between the properties of present day galaxies and the masses of their central black holes .",
    "however , the models necessarily rely on specific assumptions about the mechanisms that trigger quasar activity and the accretion rates that these mechanisms produce . to put things in our terms ,",
    "the _ ab initio _ models adopt a particular set of hypotheses about quasar activity in order to predict @xmath0 from first principles .",
    "our framework is designed to model observational data in a flexible way with relatively few assumptions , while retaining the basic physical picture of black hole accretion that underlies nearly all modern interpretations of the quasar population .",
    "one hope is that measurements of the luminosity function and the local black hole mass function will eventually allow us to integrate backwards in time and determine @xmath0 empirically , drawing on a variety of observations to test the assumptions that enter such a reconstruction .",
    "we may find that the data are not powerful enough to tie down @xmath0 without some _ a priori _ constraints on its expected form , but that finding in itself would be a valuable , if disappointing , lesson .",
    "more generally , we hope to illuminate the connections between black hole evolution and quasar activity and learn what observations can and can not tell us about these connections .",
    "the @xcite paper has had the strongest impact on our thinking about these issues , but the most direct antecedent that we know of to the approach taken here is the lucid paper of @xcite .",
    "they adopted a similar description of black hole evolution and its connection to quasar activity , and they applied this description to the observational data available at the time .",
    "advances in the observational data and the theoretical models of accretion make this an opportune time to revive and extend this approach . @xcite",
    "have recently used a similar method in assessing constraints on black hole accretion and mergers , though their assumptions and goals are more restrictive than ours  in particular , they assume that quasars radiate at eddington luminosity and thus that @xmath28 consists of @xmath29-functions at @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    the difference in the form of @xmath28 is one of the most significant differences between the models presented in this paper and most models of the quasar population in the literature .",
    "these typically assume that @xmath28 for @xmath32 is sharply peaked at some value close to eddington , such as a @xmath29-function ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a spike followed by an exponential decline ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a sharply peaked @xmath28 could arise physically if the central black hole typically plays a large role in controlling its own fuel supply , through feedback or influence on stellar dynamics .",
    "however , we think it is more likely that fueling is driven by galactic scale events  galaxy mergers , interactions , and bar formation , for example  that are minimally influenced by the central black hole , and therefore do not `` know '' that they should feed it at any particular rate .",
    "in particular , it seems reasonable that for every major event that leads to eddington - like fueling of a central black hole there are many minor events that fuel it at a sub - eddington rate .",
    "the particular functional forms that we adopt here to represent this scenario , a power - law or broken power - law @xmath28 between some @xmath33 and some @xmath34 , are arbitrary , and chosen largely for mathematical convenience , but they reflect this general thinking about the process of quasar fueling . in the long run , one goal of our effort is to test observationally whether @xmath28 is in fact a broad function or a peaked function , which would in turn have implications for the mechanisms of quasar fueling . at a qualitative level , the wide @xmath10 distribution of agn activity in the local universe ( e.g , @xcite ) seems to support the idea of a broad distribution of accretion rates .    in this paper",
    "we will keep our contact with observations relatively loose , focusing instead on presenting our framework in a clear way and illustrating how observations might distinguish among different scenarios for the quasar population .",
    "we will carry out a detailed analysis of multi - wavelength measurements of the quasar luminosity function and constraints on active black hole masses and the local black hole mass function a subsequent paper .",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath35 and @xmath36 because all of the observational papers include results for this model , and not always for the low density , @xmath37-dominated , @xmath38 model favored by recent cosmological observations .",
    "cosmology affects our models indirectly through its influence on observationally inferred luminosity functions and directly through the time - redshift relation .",
    "we would not expect a change of cosmological model to have any qualitative impact on our results , and we expect that the quantitative impact could be compensated by modest changes to mass scales and accretion rates , especially since the age of the universe is similar for @xmath35 , @xmath39 , and for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we present the definitions and key equations of our framework in the following section . we then present mathematical results for luminosity functions in  [ sec : lumfunction ] and for luminosity and black hole mass evolution in  [ sec : evolution ] , focusing on analytically solvable cases that illustrate general points . in  [ sec : illus ] we construct five illustrative models of the quasar population , each designed to match the observed evolution of the optical luminosity function but differing from one another in the typical quasar lifetime or in the importance of mergers , adaf growth , or obscuration . we show how measurements of the black hole mass function , luminosity functions at other wavelengths , the masses and accretion rates of active black holes , and the space density of host galaxies might distinguish among these scenarios .",

    ", some black holes will grow faster than average and some will grow slower , but the mass function is an average over the full population , and its evolution depends only on the average rate at which black holes move from one mass range to another .    if @xmath90 is independent of @xmath1 , then it can be moved out of the derivative on the r.h.s . of equation  ( [ eqn : acc ] ) ,",
    "and in this case the solution to the evolution equation is remarkably simple : n(m , t)=f ( ) , m_*(t ) = m_*,i ( _ t_i^t ) , [ eqn : accgrowth ] where @xmath91 is an arbitrary function and @xmath92 is any fiducial scale in the mass function .",
    "this solution can be verified by direct substitution into equation  ( [ eqn : acc ] ) , but its physical basis is easy to see .",
    "since @xmath90 is independent of mass , and only @xmath93 matters rather than the full distribution @xmath28 , the evolution is equivalent to that of a population in which all black holes accrete mass at the rate @xmath94 . in this case , every black hole grows by the exponential factor on the r.h.s .",

    "the genuine destruction of supermassive black holes seems an unlikely prospect , but they could be removed from the population of galactic nuclei by ejection in three - body encounters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which would effectively count as destruction for our purposes .",

    "a `` seed '' black hole is one that forms at low efficiency by a process that is not well described by the same @xmath28 governing most accretion driven growth  e.g. , by the collapse of a supermassive star , a relativistic gas disk , or a relativistic star cluster .",
    "if the accretion , creation , and destruction terms are ignored , equation  ( [ eqn : evol ] ) becomes the `` coagulation equation , '' which has been widely studied in the context of planetesimal growth ( see @xcite and references therein ) and applied on occasion to star formation and galaxy clustering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the coagulation equation has analytic solutions only for rather specialized forms of the collision rates @xmath104 that do not seem particularly applicable to black hole evolution , and even these solutions no longer apply once accretion is also important .",

    "the amplitude of the qlf is directly proportional to @xmath139 and to the mass function normalization @xmath140 .",
    "the value of @xmath139 determines the probability that a given black hole will be `` on '' at some non - zero luminosity . for the @xmath127 model ( lower panel ) , we have somewhat arbitrarily chosen @xmath139 so that this probability , @xmath141 , is equal to one . though all of the black holes are active in this case , most of the activity is at accretion rates near @xmath33 .",
    "we then choose a mass function normalization @xmath142 so that the model qlf matches the @xcite data point at the break luminosity .",
    "for the @xmath126 model , we have kept the same @xmath5 and again chosen @xmath139 to match the observed qlf at the break .",
    "note that equation  ( [ eqn : sol : powpofmdot ] ) reveals a complete degeneracy between @xmath140 and @xmath139 in the qlf .",
    "thus , at a fixed time , it is impossible to determine from the qlf alone if there is a high number density of black holes of which a small fraction are accreting or a low number density of black holes of which a large fraction are accreting .",
    "we will see later that the evolution of the qlf breaks this degeneracy to some degree .",
    "the qlf in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : simplelum ] demonstrates one of the important general features of this solution : the slopes of the low and high luminosity ends of the qlf are determined by the slopes of the low and high mass ends of the black hole mass function ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : sol : powpofmdot ] ) .",
    "this behavior follows whenever @xmath28 is independent of @xmath1 and the range of accretion rates is finite .",
    "this result can be understood by considering that a small range @xmath143 at @xmath30 gives @xmath144 with @xmath145 , which is a simple mapping of the black hole mass function .",
    "the same range @xmath143 at a lower @xmath3 gives a contribution to the qlf mapped to luminosities fainter by a factor of @xmath3 and up or down by a factor proportional to @xmath146 .",
    "the total qlf is just the sum of these transformed black hole mass functions .",
    "since we have low and high luminosity regimes in which only one slope of @xmath5 contributes , the sum in these regimes will be a sum of power - laws with the same slope , resulting in a qlf with the same slope .",
    "the mid - range luminosity is more complicated because both parts of the black hole mass function are contributing .",
    "the relative contributions from the low and high end of the black hole mass function depend on the relative probability of low and high accretion rates .",
    "this can be seen in the middle part of equation  ( [ eqn : sol : powpofmdot ] ) , which shows that the slope of the probability distribution as well as the slopes of @xmath5 affect the shape of the qlf in this luminosity regime .",
    "the agreement of asymptotic slopes between @xmath5 and @xmath87 motivates our choice of a double power - law @xmath5 , though we will see in  [ sec : nofmz ] that this choice has some problems when compared to local observations .",
    "the @xmath126 model in figure  [ fig : simplelum ] corresponds to equal probabilities of accretion in each logarithmic interval of @xmath3 between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but the emissivity of the population is dominated by accretion rates close to @xmath34 because luminosities are proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the model qlf is in reasonably good agreement with the @xcite data .",
    "dotted , short - dashed , and long - dashed lines in the qlf panels show the contribution from accretion rates in the ranges @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 respectively . for @xmath126 ,",
    "the qlf is dominated by black holes with near - eddington accretion rates at all luminosities .",
    "the curves for lower accretion rates are shifted horizontally to lower luminosities , with slight vertical shifts because the three bins are not equal logarithmic intervals .",
    "the @xmath127 model has equal contributions to the emissivity from each logarithmic interval of @xmath3 .",
    "the slow transition between the low and high luminosity regimes yields a worse fit to the @xcite qlf .",
    "high accretion rates still dominate the high end of the qlf , but low accretion rates dominate the low end .",
    "in general , low @xmath3 black holes can more easily make a significant contribution below the break in the luminosity function because a shift `` left '' can be more easily compensated by a shift `` up , '' especially when the slope of the low end of the mass function is shallow .",
    "however , above the break in luminosity , it is difficult for low @xmath3 accretors to make a contribution .",
    "for example , a @xmath28 slope @xmath150 would be required to make the contribution of low and high accretion rates comparable at high luminosities in figure  [ fig : simplelum ] .",

    "adaf contributions can be more significant at low redshifts and x - ray wavelengths , as discussed in  [ sec : wavelength ] below .",
    "the middle panel shows the effect of increasing @xmath125 to 1.0 , with @xmath139 decreased to keep @xmath156 fixed .",
    "super - eddington accretion is now common enough that it dominates the high end of the qlf , with a comparable but smaller contribution from thin - disk accretion with @xmath157 .",
    "lower luminosities are dominated by thin - disk accretion , with high accretion onto lower mass black holes more important than low accretion onto high mass black holes .",
    "the bottom panels show a case with @xmath154 and a low end slope of @xmath158 , which weights @xmath28 more strongly to low accretion rates .",
    "the high luminosity end of the qlf in the bottom panel has contributions similar to those in the upper panel , but the low luminosity end is now dominated by lower accretion rates in the thin - disk mode .",
    "the turnover of the qlf in the lower panel is less sharp than in the upper panel because of the change of the relative fraction of high and low accretion rates contributing to the qlf over the transitional range of luminosity .",
    "the contribution from the adaf mode is higher than in the top panel , but it remains small at all luminosities .    as noted earlier , with the luminosity function alone there is a complete degeneracy between the normalizations @xmath140 and @xmath139 , subject only to the limitation that the fraction of black holes accreting at a given time not exceed 100% .",
    "there is also a partial degeneracy between the characteristic values @xmath92 and @xmath125 : increasing @xmath117 shifts the break in the qlf to higher luminosity , but reducing @xmath125 makes lower accretion rates dominate the qlf , shifting the break back down . with our assumption that the efficiency @xmath159 decreases for @xmath84 , this tradeoff is limited to a factor of a few , since changes in @xmath125 also affect the shape of the turnover in the qlf .",
    "we will see later that this tradeoff is even more restricted when the evolution of the qlf is considered .",
    "the masses of active black holes can be estimated using reverberation mapping ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the widths of lines such as h@xmath115 and civ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "[ eqn : effofmdot ] ) , then black holes with @xmath160^{-1}$ ] can not contribute to the qlf at luminosity @xmath45 because they can not shine brightly enough .",
    "conversely , black holes with @xmath161^{-1}$ ] are always brighter than @xmath45 , when they are active at all .",
    "the contribution to the qlf from black holes with masses in the allowed range is the product of the number density of black holes with mass @xmath1 and the probability of having an accretion rate in the range @xmath162 that yields luminosity @xmath163 .",
    "thus , for a quasar of luminosity @xmath45 , the relative probability that its black hole has mass @xmath164 or @xmath165 , if both masses are in the allowed range , is  =   n(m_1 ) p(=l l m_1 ) l /m_1",

    "we see that if @xmath168 then the rising low end of the mass function results in low mass black holes with high accretion rates dominating the active population at luminosity @xmath45 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath169 , then low accretion rates are common enough that high mass black holes with low @xmath3 dominate .",
    "a single power - law can only approximate @xmath5 or @xmath28 over a finite range , but this example gives insight into the more general case and allows one to judge whether quasars of luminosity @xmath45 are likely to be dominated by masses near a break in @xmath5 , or by accretion rates near a break in @xmath28 or @xmath159 .",
    "for example , the high luminosity regime figure  [ fig : dblpowlum ] is dominated by eddington luminosity black holes ( near a break in @xmath65 ) because of the steep slope of @xmath5 at high masses .    for a statistical quantity that is easier to measure ,",
    "it is usually desirable to integrate equation  ( [ eqn : relmassdist ] ) to obtain the distribution of black hole masses for a specified range in luminosities .",
    "we will show in  [ sec : illus ] that such statistics can discriminate between models that yield similar qlfs over the range of observed luminosities but have significantly different parameter values .",
    "a general mass - dependent distribution of accretion rates can be written in the form @xmath170 , where @xmath171 at an arbitrarily chosen mass scale @xmath172 and the function @xmath102 encodes the mass dependence , with @xmath173 . to understand the potential influence of mass dependence",
    ", we will consider the restricted case in which the function @xmath174 is independent of @xmath3 , and @xmath11 is thus a separable function . in this class of models , the relative probabilities of high and low accretion rates are independent of mass , but the overall duty cycle can have an arbitrary mass dependence . recall that the general expressions for the qlf ( eq .  [ eqn : lumfun ] ) and the distribution @xmath175 of black hole masses at a given luminosity ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : relmassdist ] ) involve @xmath11 and @xmath5 only through the product @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , for any qlf and @xmath175 generated by a black hole mass function @xmath5 and a mass - independent @xmath28 , there is a family of models with mass function @xmath177 and mass - dependent accretion rate distribution @xmath178 that predicts the same qlf and @xmath175 , for any choice of the function @xmath174 .",
    "the mass dependence of @xmath28 therefore introduces a rather serious degeneracy into models of the luminosity function , which can not be broken by measurements of the distribution of _ active _ black hole masses .",
    "the key difference within this class of degenerate models is the relation between the luminosity function and the underlying black hole mass function @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we have shown in  [ sec : powerlawpofmdot ] and  [ sec : dblpowpofmdot ] that for a mass - independent @xmath28 the low and high luminosity slopes of the qlf match the low and high mass slopes of @xmath5 .",
    "this is no longer the case if @xmath28 depends on @xmath1 .",
    "for example , with @xmath179 and a double power - law @xmath5 , the qlf has asymptotic slopes @xmath180 and @xmath181 , rather than @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "thus , a measurement of the mass function of all black holes , not just the active ones , is crucial to diagnosing the mass dependence of accretion rates .",
    "our discussion above focuses on the qlf at a particular redshift , and the degeneracy applies if @xmath11 and @xmath5 can be chosen at will . if one considers a range of redshifts over which black holes grow by a substantial factor , then the predictions of models with different mass dependence of @xmath11 are likely to diverge , since the mass - dependence of growth rates will change the shape of @xmath4 from one model to the next ( see  [ sec : massdepdeclining ] ) .",
    "thus , this degeneracy should be less serious in a complete evolutionary model of the population .",
    "furthermore , a measurement of @xmath5 at @xmath9 may be sufficient to diagnose the mass dependence of @xmath11 at higher redshift .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : lumfun ] ) gives the bolometric luminosity function @xmath87 in terms of the accretion rate distribution , the black hole mass function , and the efficiency @xmath65 , which may itself be a function of @xmath3 .",

    "the story is more interesting if some accreting black holes have radically different sed shapes . here",
    "we will consider two representative examples , an `` obscured '' accretion mode in which optical , uv , and soft x - ray radiation are absorbed by gas and dust near the nucleus and re - radiated in the far - ir , and an adaf mode that has a high ratio of x - ray flux to optical flux ( in addition to a reduced bolometric efficiency ) .",
    "obscured accretion is thought to play an important role in producing the x - ray background , and typical synthesis models in the literature have a @xmath184 ratio of obscured to unobscured sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more recent results from _ chandra _ show that the obscured fraction is probably lower than this , especially at high luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "adafs are expected on theoretical grounds to have depressed uv / optical emission relative to x - ray and far - ir @xcite , and many low luminosity agn in the nearby universe , including sgr a@xmath185 in the galactic center , appear to have these broader sed shapes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are , of course , other possibilities for sed variations , including a steady change of sed shape with black hole mass caused by the lower characteristic temperatures around higher mass black holes , a change of sed shape in the super - eddington regime , and perhaps a transition within the @xmath186 regime as the accretion disk grows in importance relative to the hard x - ray corona .",

    "figure  [ fig : massbh ] is interesting both for the features that are common to all of the models and for the features that distinguish them .",
    "the key common feature is a change in the relation between mass and luminosity from high redshift to low redshift . at @xmath8 , in all models , the sequence of luminosity is also a sequence of black hole mass : the median active mass rises from @xmath445 in the lowest luminosity range to @xmath446 in the highest luminosity range , roughly the same factor by which the luminosity itself rises . comparing the symbols to the black dots",
    "shows that low luminosity quasars arise from sub-@xmath92 black holes and high luminosity quasars from super-@xmath92 black holes .",
    "the 10%90% range of masses in a given luminosity range is only about 0.4-dex , similar to the width of the luminosity bin itself . at low redshift ,",
    "on the other hand , the trend of median mass with luminosity is much weaker , and even @xmath447 systems have median masses lower than @xmath92 .",
    "the distribution of masses for a given luminosity range is much broader than at high redshift , typically close to an order of magnitude .",
    "as we show more directly in figure  [ fig : mdot ] below , the luminosity function at low redshift represents largely a sequence of accretion rate rather than black hole mass .",

    "@xmath444 is similar at a given luminosity for all models . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the  model , which has the least @xmath92 growth , always has the lowest @xmath444 at a given luminosity , followed by the obscured model , which has the next lowest growth of @xmath92 .",
    "the merger and adaf models have the most @xmath92 growth and the highest @xmath444 values at low redshift .",
    "the adaf model is generally highest , even though the merger model overtakes it in @xmath92 by @xmath9 , because the high probability of low @xmath3 favors high mass black holes at a given luminosity .",
    "the 10%90% spread at a given redshift is generally similar among the models .",
    "the trends and model differences that we have shown here for @xmath122-band luminosity generally hold for luminosities defined in other bands as well .",
    "the most significant change is that the median black hole mass at fixed ( in @xmath448 ) fir luminosity is much smaller in the obscured model than in all other models because a large fraction of the obscured sed emerges in the fir band , enabling low mass black holes to produce high luminosity .",
    "the other significant change is that the median masses for the adaf model are considerably lower in both x - ray bands because adaf accretors emit a larger fraction of their bolometric energy in x - rays .",
    "while the distributions of black hole masses and of accretion rates associated with a given luminosity provide essentially the same information , it is helpful to look directly at both distributions . figure  [ fig : mdot ] is similar in spirit to figure  [ fig : massbh ] , but it shows the distribution of accretion rates at a given luminosity rather than the distribution of black hole masses .",
    "symbols mark the median value of @xmath449 , vertical bars show the 10%90% range of the distribution , and small black dots show each model s @xmath125 at each redshift .",
    "a model - to - model comparison shows essentially the reverse behavior from figure  [ fig : massbh ] , with higher median black hole masses corresponding to lower median accretion rates .",
    "the key results are that the median @xmath3 is close to @xmath125 at all luminosities at @xmath8 , in all of the models , while at low redshift the median @xmath3 is an increasing function of luminosity . furthermore , even the low luminosity systems tend to have @xmath450 at low redshift .",
    "the adaf model is the outlier in this plot because its @xmath28 distribution is strongly skewed to favor low accretion rates .",
    "it consistently has the lowest median accretion rate at a given luminosity and redshift , and the spread in accretion rates is large . at @xmath188 ,",
    "the median @xmath3 in the @xmath451 luminosity bin is equal to the critical value @xmath68 at which adaf accretion sets in , indicating that about half of optically systems selected in this luminosity range are predicted to be adaf accretors .",
    "a similar conclusion holds even for the highest luminosity bin at @xmath9 .",
    "the situation is more extreme for x - ray selection , where the adaf model predicts a median @xmath3 in the adaf range in _ all _ luminosity ranges at @xmath439 . as already noted in ",
    "[ sec : multilambda ] , this prediction that a large fraction of luminous x - ray quasars are adaf systems appears to be an empirical failure of this model .",
    "all five of our models assume @xmath28 independent of mass , and the transition in behavior from high redshift to low redshift is a consequence of the declining evolution of @xmath125 that is required to match the @xcite luminosity evolution in any such model .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : massdepevol ] , it is also possible to reproduce the @xcite results with a model in which @xmath125 is constant but @xmath0 is mass - dependent . since this model is dominated by thin - disk accretors , its luminosity function is similar to that of our  model in every band .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : shortvsmassdep ] shows that its predicted distribution of active black hole masses is strikingly different at low redshift . because the mass - dependent model reproduces the downward evolution of @xmath263 by preferentially reducing activity in massive systems , it predicts much lower median black hole masses at any luminosity at low redshift .",
    "furthermore , the luminosity function remains primarily a sequence of black hole mass even at low redshift , with the median mass rising by a factor of ten between our lowest and highest luminosity bins at @xmath9 , compared to only a factor of three for the  model . because of the tight link between black hole mass and luminosity in this model , the spread in masses at a given luminosity remains small even at low redshift .",
    "the evolution of the distribution of active black hole masses thus provides an excellent tool for deciding whether the observed decline of @xmath263 reflects decreasing characteristic accretion rates or a preferential drop in activity among more massive black holes .",
    "recent studies using line widths to estimate black hole masses for large data samples ( e.g. , @xcite ) provide the kind of data needed to test the predictions in figure  [ fig : massbh][fig : shortvsmassdep ] . vestergaard s ( @xcite )",
    "figure 5a bins estimated black hole masses by luminosity and redshift , allowing a qualitative comparison . at @xmath138 , the typical estimated masses for @xmath452 are @xmath453 , in agreement with our model initial conditions , and there is a clear trend of estimated black hole mass with luminosity , though perhaps less strong than the nearly linear relation predicted by our models . at @xmath227",
    ", there is a broader spread in estimated masses at a given luminosity , as predicted by our standard models in which @xmath125 declines at low @xmath2 .",
    "however , the typical mass at @xmath452 is @xmath454 , which is in between the predictions of the mass - independent @xmath28 and mass - dependent @xmath28 models shown in figure  [ fig : shortvsmassdep ] .",
    "careful assessment and modeling of the statistical errors is needed to draw reliable conclusions from a more quantitative comparison , since the random errors in the mass estimates are large enough ( a factor @xmath438 ) to distort the underlying mass distributions significantly .",
    "some of our models have a low space density of black holes and a high duty cycle  i.e. , low @xmath5 and high @xmath28  while others have more numerous black holes and lower duty cycles .",
    "unfortunately , neither the luminosity function nor the distribution of active black hole masses distinguishes these cases , since both depend only on the product @xmath455 ( see eqs .",
    "[ eqn : lumfun ] and  [ eqn : relmassdist ] ) .",
    "however , if the locally observed correlations between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion or luminosity continue to higher redshifts , they offer a tool for diagnosing , at least approximately , the underlying space density of black holes that shine at a given luminosity .",
    "if the space density is low and the duty cycle high , then quasars should reside in rare host galaxies with luminous bulges .",
    "if the space density is high , then host galaxies should include later type and less luminous systems .",
    "to translate this idea into a precisely defined observable , we find the median mass of black holes that produce quasars in a given luminosity range ( the symbols in figure  [ fig : massbh ] ) , then compute the space density of black holes with this mass or greater .",
    "the corresponding observational program would require measuring the median host galaxy luminosity @xmath456 of quasars in the same luminosity range , then measuring the galaxy luminosity function at the same redshift and computing @xmath457 , the space density of galaxies brighter than @xmath456 .",
    "the predicted and observable quantities are directly comparable if the scatter between @xmath407 and @xmath458 is negligible .",
    "note that this condition does not imply negligible scatter between @xmath459 and @xmath458 , since @xmath3 variations still produce variations in quasar luminosity .",
    "since black hole mass appears to be most directly correlated with bulge properties , one would ideally use host bulge luminosity and the bulge luminosity function rather than total luminosities .",
    "accurate bulge - disk decomposition at high redshift may be impractical , however , especially in the presence of an active nucleus , so the next best thing is to use a red passband that is sensitive to old stellar populations . while the space density of hosts is not as informative as an actual measurement of the black hole mass function @xmath4 , it is less demanding observationally , since it does not require _ calibration _ of the @xmath460 relation at high redshift , only the existence of a relation with relatively small scatter .",
    "figure  [ fig : spacedens ] shows the model results for the luminosity ranges @xmath461 and @xmath462 at redshifts @xmath8 , 1 , 0.5 , and 0 .",
    "as expected , the  model starts with a host space density that is a factor of ten below that of the model , and although it catches up at lower redshift because of the greater amount of black hole growth , a considerable gap remains .",
    "the obscured model starts with an @xmath5 close to that of the  model , and its predictions for host space densities remain close to it at all redshifts , with the greater growth of black hole masses largely compensated by the faster decline in @xmath125 .",
    "note , however , that this model s prediction would have been quite different if we had implemented it by boosting the black hole space density instead of the duty cycle .",
    "the merger model is identical to the  model at @xmath8 , but its distinctive evolution of @xmath5 , with low mass black holes transforming into high mass black holes , leads to different behavior of the predicted space densities with redshift and with luminosity .",
    "in particular , the low-@xmath2 depletion of the low end of @xmath5 leads to a relatively low space density , especially at low luminosity .",
    "the adaf model starts with a relatively low @xmath5 ( intermediate between  and ) and thus a relatively low host space density .",
    "however , its mass function overtakes that of  at high masses by @xmath266 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rationofmevol ] ) , and the predicted host space densities are similar for @xmath447 . at low luminosities and higher redshifts , the adaf model has a lower space density despite its large amount of black hole growth because its @xmath28 distribution favors rarer , higher mass black holes at a given luminosity .",
    "the model that stands out most distinctively in figure  [ fig : spacedens ] , at least in terms of its redshift dependence , is the mass - dependent @xmath28 model , shown by the filled triangles .",
    "because this model matches the qlf by shifting activity preferentially towards low mass black holes at low redshift , the predicted host space density climbs rapidly . in this model",
    ", the hosts of moderate luminosity quasars at low redshift should include relatively late - type galaxies and low luminosity ellipticals . in effect , the properties of hosts offer an indirect way to detect the sharp decline in typical active black hole mass shown in figure  [ fig : shortvsmassdep ] .",
    "if the masses of black holes are correlated with the masses of the dark matter halos in which they reside , a natural expectation given the observed correlation with bulge velocity dispersion , then quasar clustering provides another observational tool for inferring their space density .",
    "a low black hole space density implies that the host halos are rare , massive systems that tend to be strongly clustered @xcite , while a high space density implies more common , less strongly clustered hosts .",
    "this is the idea behind the proposals of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to constrain quasar lifetimes ( hence duty cycles , hence black hole space densities ) using the quasar correlation function or the quasar - galaxy cross - correlation function ( see also @xcite ) . in figure  [ fig : spacedens ] , models with low points predict strong quasar clustering and models with high points predict weaker clustering .",
    "to a first approximation , one could calculate the expected bias ( relative to mass clustering ) for quasars in the two luminosity ranges by reading off the space density from the figure , finding the mass threshold for halos that have this space density given an assumed cosmological model , and calculating the bias of halos above this mass threshold using the methods of mo & white ( @xcite ; see @xcite [ @xcite ] for a more detailed description of this approach ) .",
    "one could also carry out a more thorough calculation , weighting the contribution to the bias by the fraction of black holes of a given mass contributing to the luminosity range , but we suspect that the results would not be very different .",
    "recent results from the 2df quasar redshift survey favor a relatively low comoving correlation length , @xmath463mpc in redshift space , with no clear evidence for dependence on redshift or luminosity @xcite .",
    "using the @xcite model , which assumes simple on - off quasar activity with a monotonic relation between quasar luminosity and host halo mass , the implied lifetime is short , @xmath464 years .",
    "the current data set is not quite large enough to allow a precise clustering measurement for a volume - limited subset of quasars at @xmath465 , which is what one would ideally like to use for the lifetime analysis .",
    "however , if future results continue to show a low correlation length at high redshift , and no significant dependence on luminosity , then they may indicate that there is substantial scatter in the relation between quasar luminosity and host halo mass .",
    "this scatter could in turn indicate that the correlation between black hole mass and halo mass at high redshift is much weaker than the measured correlation between black hole mass and bulge mass at low redshift , or else that the luminous quasars have a wide range of @xmath10 even at high-@xmath2 .",
    "clustering analyses of the full 2df quasar survey and of the sdss quasar survey should yield interesting insights on these questions over the next few years .",
    "in the framework developed here , the central actor in black hole and quasar evolution is the accretion rate distribution @xmath0 , the probability that a black hole of mass @xmath1 accretes at a rate @xmath3 ( in eddington units ) at redshift @xmath2 . given a model for the accretion efficiency as a function of @xmath3 , which can be inferred from observations and theoretical considerations that are largely independent of qlf evolution _",
    "per se _ , the combination of @xmath11 and the black hole mass function @xmath5 determines the bolometric luminosity function via equation  ( [ eqn : lumfun ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of mergers , @xmath0 determines the evolution of @xmath4 given a `` boundary value '' of @xmath5 at some redshift .",
    "mergers can complicate the picture by changing @xmath5 independently of @xmath0 .",
    "we have generally made the plausible but not incontrovertible assumption that black holes accreting in the range @xmath466 have `` thin - disk '' efficiencies @xmath356 and that efficiencies decrease at higher ( super - eddington ) and lower ( adaf ) accretion rates ( eq .  [ eqn : effofmdot ] ) .",
    "we have derived many of our results under the mathematically simplifying assumption that @xmath28 is independent of mass .",
    "while this assumption is unlikely to hold to high accuracy , it may be a reasonable approximation at redshifts near the peak of quasar activity , since black holes that grow faster than their peers tend to reduce their accretion rates in eddington units and _ vice versa_. most of our specific examples assume that @xmath5 and @xmath28 are double power - laws with breaks at @xmath92 and @xmath125 , respectively , with @xmath28 truncated at @xmath467 and @xmath468 .",
    "our framework yields a number of mathematical results that give insight into the relations among the black hole mass function , the accretion rate distribution , and the qlf .",
    "when @xmath28 is independent of mass , the convolution integral  ( [ eqn : lumfun ] ) for @xmath87 can be understood as follows : for each range @xmath57 , the mass function @xmath5 is mapped to a luminosity @xmath469 , multiplied by @xmath60 , and added to a running total . if @xmath5 is a double power - law and the range of @xmath3",
    "is bounded , then the asymptotic slopes of @xmath87 must equal the low and high mass slopes of @xmath5 , since high luminosity objects must come from black holes with @xmath470 and low luminosity objects must come from black holes with @xmath471 . in the intermediate luminosity regime , where black holes above and below @xmath92 can both contribute , the qlf turns over in a way that depends on the slopes of @xmath5 and the shape of @xmath28 . for our usual double power - law @xmath28 ,",
    "the qlf break occurs at a luminosity @xmath472 .",
    "if @xmath125 is close to one , then the break luminosity corresponds roughly to the eddington luminosity of @xmath92 objects , and the slope above the break corresponds to the high mass slope of @xmath5 .",
    "however , if @xmath125 is low , then the turnover may be associated largely with the change in slope of @xmath28 , and the asymptotic regime where the high-@xmath45 slope of @xmath87 matches the high-@xmath1 slope of @xmath5 may only be reached beyond the observed range of luminosities . for most of the models that we have presented here , which are designed to match the @xcite optical luminosity function , the first case applies at high redshift and the second at low redshift .",
    "a key feature of our model of accretion physics is that objects do not radiate at super - eddington luminosities  instead , we assume that the efficiency is @xmath71 for @xmath473 , so that super - eddington accretors radiate at @xmath474 .",
    "although we have generally adopted @xmath475 for fitting data at @xmath476 , our results would not be very different if we took @xmath477 , or if we changed the maximum accretion rate or the high-@xmath3 slope , because the change in efficiency would cut off the luminosity distribution at @xmath478 anyway .",
    "our results would also not be very different if we assumed that black holes fed at a super - eddington rate by their host galaxy regulate their accretion by outflows or convection @xcite so that they gain mass at @xmath479 and radiate at @xmath480 .",
    "if such flows drove gas out into the galaxy halo , they would effectively truncate @xmath28 at @xmath30 , while if they returned gas to a reservoir from which it would eventually be accreted , they would transform the @xmath84 tail of @xmath28 into a spike at @xmath30 . with our standard efficiency assumptions ,",
    "the latter scenario would increase the average radiative efficiency of high-@xmath3 accretion , by moving it from the super - eddington regime to the thin - disk regime , thus yielding more luminosity for a given amount of black hole growth . changing the accretion physics to allow @xmath481 with @xmath473 , and thus to allow substantially super - eddington luminosities when the accretion rate is high @xcite ,",
    "would have a more drastic effect on our results . in this case",
    ", only a truncation of @xmath28 would cut off the luminosity distribution at a given black hole mass , and the predicted luminosity function would therefore be sensitive to the values of @xmath125 and @xmath34 and to the shape of @xmath28 at @xmath473 .",
    "the fraction of black holes of mass @xmath1 that are active at a luminosity @xmath45 is proportional to @xmath482 , the underlying black hole space density times the probability of having the accretion rate required to shine at @xmath45 .",
    "the same product appears in the integrand for the luminosity function itself ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : lumfun ] ) , but by constraining the integrand rather than the integral , measurements of active black hole masses can discriminate among models that produce similar @xmath87 with different @xmath28 and @xmath5 . in terms of our double power - law models ,",

    "a general mass - dependent @xmath28 can be written in the form @xmath483 , with @xmath484 for some fiducial mass @xmath172 and @xmath485 .",
    "with such a mass dependence , we can still understand the convolution integral for @xmath87 by considering the contribution from each range @xmath486 , but where the sum before involved only horizontally and vertically shifted versions of the mass function @xmath5 , now the mass function can be tilted or distorted by @xmath487 before being added to the running total .",
    "mass - dependence of @xmath28 thus breaks the tight link between @xmath5 and @xmath87 and adds freedom to models of the qlf .",
    "specifically , for a model with a given @xmath5 and a mass - independent @xmath28 , there is a family of models with different @xmath5 and mass - dependent @xmath28 that yield identical predictions for @xmath87 and the distribution of _ active _ black hole masses .",
    "however , this degeneracy applies only at a single redshift ; the evolution of models with mass - dependent @xmath28 is different because the shape of @xmath5 changes with time .",
    "furthermore , while the active black hole mass distributions are the same , the underlying black hole mass functions are different , and a measurement of the full @xmath5 at @xmath9 may be sufficient to diagnose the mass - dependence of @xmath28 at higher redshifts . if two models have similar underlying @xmath5 , then the masses of active black holes or space densities of their host galaxies are powerful diagnostics for mass dependence of @xmath28 , as illustrated in figures  [ fig : shortvsmassdep ] and  [ fig : spacedens ] .    for evolutionary calculations , a crucial simplification ( eq .  [ eqn : acc ] )",
    "is that the accretion driven growth of @xmath5 depends only on the mean accretion rate @xmath488 , not on the full form of the distribution function . between times",
    "@xmath287 and @xmath288 , a black hole with accretion rate @xmath489 grows in mass by a factor @xmath490 , where @xmath491 is the accretion weighted lifetime ( eq .  [ eqn : tacc ] ) and @xmath48 is the salpeter time ( eq .  [ eqn : tsdef ] ) . in any particular mass bin ,",
    "some of the black holes grow faster than average and some grow slower , but @xmath5 evolves as if all of them grew at the average rate for that bin . if @xmath93 is independent of mass , then the growth factor is the same for all mass bins , and the mass function simply shifts in a self - similar fashion , preserving its shape ( eq .  [ eqn : accgrowth ] )",
    ". one might expect this self - similar behavior to emerge , approximately , as a `` fixed point '' solution during the epoch of rapid black hole growth .",
    "if @xmath93 depends on mass , then the shape of @xmath5 changes with time , becoming steeper if low mass black holes grow more rapidly and shallower if high mass black holes grow more rapidly .",
    "our results also imply a number of critical values for the logarithmic slopes of @xmath28 and @xmath5 , where the character of the solutions changes .",
    "we summarize these critical slopes in appendix  [ sec : appx2 ] .",
    "the most important result of this sort is that growth by accretion drives @xmath5 at fixed mass up if the mass function is steeper than @xmath492 and down if it is shallower , and that the corresponding critical slope for merger driven growth is @xmath338 rather than @xmath337 .",
    "generically , one expects mergers to increase @xmath5 at high masses and decrease it at low masses .",
    "we have kept the comparison to observations in this paper rather loose , saving detailed tests of models against multi - wavelength luminosity functions and estimates of black hole mass distributions for future work .",
    "however , we are able to draw some interesting general conclusions from our efforts to reproduce the observed evolution of the optical luminosity function .    at @xmath493 ,",
    "we have focused on the @xcite evolution results , and particularly on their finding that the qlf has a break that shifts to lower luminosities at lower redshifts . in any model where @xmath28 is independent of mass",
    ", reproducing this result requires a shift towards lower typical accretion rates over time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dblpowevol ] ) . decreasing the duty cycle uniformly by reducing",
    "the amplitude of @xmath28 can lower the normalization of @xmath87 , but on its own it can not shift the break to lower luminosities , since black hole masses , and thus the location of the break in @xmath5 , can only increase with time . lowering the break luminosity",
    "requires decreasing the probability of high accretion rates _ relative _ to low accretion rates . in the context of our double power - law models ,",
    "this change is achieved by reducing @xmath125 , from slightly below unity at @xmath138 to far below unity at @xmath494 .",
    "physically , such a change could arise because of decreasing gas supplies and increasing dynamical times in galaxies at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this reduction in @xmath125 is a change in the nature of the qlf between high and low redshift . at high redshift ,",
    "the sequence of quasar luminosities is primarily a sequence of black hole masses . because @xmath125 is close to unity and @xmath28 is shallow below the break , most high luminosity quasars are produced by the more numerous low mass black holes accreting at @xmath495 rather than extremely rare high mass black holes with low accretion rates .",
    "the typical mass at a given luminosity is @xmath496 , and a factor of ten increase in luminosity roughly corresponds to a factor of ten increase in black hole mass .",
    "however , once @xmath125 falls well below unity , there is a large range @xmath497 over which @xmath28 is steep ( @xmath498 for most of our models ) , thus increasing the probability that a given luminosity is generated by a high mass black hole accreting at a low @xmath3 close to @xmath125 .",
    "the typical active black hole mass still increases with luminosity , but at low redshift a factor of ten increase in @xmath45 corresponds to only a factor @xmath438 increase in median black hole mass , and the range in black hole mass at fixed luminosity is much larger than at high redshift . at low redshift ,",
    "the sequence of quasar luminosities remains partly a sequence of black hole mass , but it is also in large part a sequence of @xmath3 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : massbh ] and  [ fig : mdot ] ) .",
    "this change in character arises only because we reduce the radiative efficiency in the super - eddington regime , forcing systems with @xmath473 to radiate at the eddington luminosity . without this transition in the accretion physics",
    ", there would be no preferred scale to change the relative importance of mass and @xmath3 between high and low redshift , since we assume the same double power law _ form _ of @xmath28 at all redshifts and it is only the value of @xmath125 relative to unity that changes . if the efficiency does not decrease in the super - eddington regime , then the shape of the luminosity function depends in detail on the form and cutoff of @xmath28 at @xmath473 .",
    "however , the limited data on masses of high redshift black holes generally shows systems with @xmath499 but not substantially larger @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that there is indeed a break in the radiative efficiency at @xmath495 , or else that black hole accretion self - regulates to enforce @xmath500 , since otherwise it would require @xmath28 to cut off coincidentally at @xmath473 and be relatively high at @xmath3 just below one .",
    "if @xmath28 is mass - dependent , then there is a fundamentally different alternative for explaining the shift of the qlf break to lower luminosities : instead of a decline in characteristic accretion rates , the mass - dependence can itself evolve so that activity is preferentially suppressed in high mass black holes at low redshift ( fig .  [",
    "fig : massdepevol ] ) .",
    "physically , such behavior could arise because high mass black holes reside in early type galaxies with large bulges , which tend to exhaust their gas supplies earlier . in this scenario , quasars at a given position on the luminosity function ( relative to @xmath263 )",
    "are always associated with the same distribution of accretion rates , but the associated black hole mass declines with redshift as the high mass black holes turn off . in comparison with the mass - independent @xmath28 models ,",
    "the median black hole mass at fixed luminosity is lower , and the range of black hole masses is smaller , with near - eddington accretors making a large contribution to the high end of the luminosity function at all redshifts ( see figure  [ fig : shortvsmassdep ] ) .",
    "the low black hole mass implies a high space density of hosts , so this model predicts that a larger fraction of low redshift quasars reside in late type or low luminosity galaxies .    based on anecdotal evidence ,",
    "it is hard to say whether a decline in characteristic accretion rates or a decline in the activity of high mass black holes is more important in producing the observed decline of @xmath263 at @xmath7 .",
    "the first scenario s prediction of a wider range of @xmath10 at lower redshifts seems in qualitative agreement with studies of black hole masses @xcite .",
    "the second scenario seems in qualitative agreement with the relative quiescence of the black holes in most massive ellipticals ( such as m87 ) , though @xcite find that the most luminous agn in the local universe do reside in massive , early type systems .",
    "the two scenarios make quantitatively different predictions , and careful comparison to studies of active black hole masses and host galaxy properties should be able to show whether one mechanism dominates or both are comparably important .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that active black hole masses at low redshift are intermediate between the values predicted by the two models shown in figure  [ fig : shortvsmassdep ] .    at high redshifts , constraints on the form of the qlf are weaker ; in particular , the sdss measurements of @xcite probe only the high luminosity end of @xmath87 . for matching the observed evolution over the range @xmath225 to @xmath138 , we find one acceptable solution in which @xmath28 is roughly constant in eddington units and the growth of the black holes themselves drives the growth in amplitude of the qlf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] ) . with our adopted parameters ,",
    "the black holes grow by a factor @xmath501 between @xmath307 and @xmath8 , and the space density at @xmath8 is @xmath502 at @xmath308 .",
    "significantly lower normalizations of @xmath5 at @xmath8 are not allowed because they would require a negative black hole mass density at @xmath307 .",
    "higher normalizations are allowed , in which case the quasar duty cycle is shorter , the rate of black hole growth is smaller , and the growth of the qlf is driven by a steady increase in @xmath28 . while a solution with a high black hole space density can give an acceptable match to the qlf , it seems physically unattractive because it requires that most of the black hole mass density was already in place at @xmath307 , before the main epoch of quasar activity . in this latter scenario ,",
    "the luminous phases of quasars represent the addition of a small amount of mass to already formed black holes .",
    "if we assume instead that the observed optical qlf _ does _ trace the growth of black holes , and that the former model is therefore more realistic , then our analysis predicts a black hole space density @xmath503 at @xmath504 at @xmath8 , and continuation to @xmath9 implies a similar space density at @xmath505 .",
    "however , we have not investigated the sensitivity of this prediction to our specific choices of parameters , such as the double power - law form and adopted slopes of @xmath28 and @xmath5 . black hole mergers and obscured accretion",
    "could also alter the prediction significantly , especially at low redshift .",
    "many of the qualitative results mentioned above could have been anticipated without detailed calculations .",
    "our framework , however , allows one to compute quantitative predictions of concrete models that illustrate distinct ideas about the nature of black hole and quasar evolution .",
    "we did this in  [ sec : illus ] for the low redshift @xmath506 regime , adopting as our baseline a model with quasar emission and black hole growth dominated by unobscured thin - disk accretion and a normalization of @xmath507 implying a short quasar lifetime , and , consequently , little growth of black hole masses from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "we compared this model to four variants : one with a lower @xmath507 and correspondingly longer quasar lifetime , one with a 4:1 ratio of obscured to unobscured systems , one with a large amount of merger driven growth of black hole masses , and one with a boosted probability of low-@xmath3 accretion leading to substantial adaf growth of black holes . for each scenario , we are able to find parameters that acceptably reproduce the @xcite optical qlf at @xmath8 , 1 , and 0.5 .",
    "relative to the  model , the  model starts at @xmath8 with a factor @xmath389 lower @xmath5 at every mass . because of the larger amount of accretion per black hole , however , the  @xmath5 overtakes the  @xmath5 at high masses by @xmath9 , while remaining below it at low masses .",
    "the two models have similar qlfs at every wavelength , since they match in the optical by construction and are dominated by systems with the @xcite sed .",
    "however , the growth of @xmath92 in the  model requires a more rapid decline of @xmath125 to compensate , so at lower redshifts it predicts lower median @xmath3 and higher median black hole mass at a given luminosity .",
    "the two models can thus be distinguished observationally by the @xmath9 black hole mass function , by the mass distributions of active black holes at @xmath508 , and by the space densities of host systems , which are lower in the  model at every luminosity and redshift .    in the obscured model , the large amount of obscured accretion produces more black hole growth than in the  model , leading to a higher @xmath5 and @xmath326 at low redshift . by @xmath9",
    ", @xmath5 is higher by a factor @xmath389 at high masses .",
    "however , the median black hole mass and host space density at a given optical luminosity are only slightly higher .",
    "the clearest distinguishing feature of this model is the relative amplitude of luminosity functions in different wavelength bands , a consequence of the different sed shapes of obscured and unobscured accretors . at @xmath8 , the 2 - 10 kev luminosity function",
    "is elevated by nearly a factor of five , the ratio of all systems to unobscured systems .",
    "this boost decreases towards low redshift because of the increasing importance of obscuration in the ( observed - frame ) 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "the 0.5 - 2 kev band is heavily obscured at @xmath7 , so the soft x - ray luminosity function of the obscured model is similar to that of the  and  models , except at @xmath8 where it has a higher amplitude at low luminosity .",
    "the strongest departure of all is in the fir , where the re - radiated emission of obscured accretors boosts @xmath87 by factors of ten ( low luminosity ) to one hundred ( high luminosity ) , relative to the  and  models .",
    "this crucial prediction should soon be testable by _ sirtf _ and by other sub - mm and mm - wavelength observations .    in the merger model",
    ", low redshift mergers strongly distort the initial black hole mass function , depleting it at low masses and boosting it at high masses , with a factor of 16 increase in the high mass end at @xmath9 relative to the  model .",
    "the quasar population of this model is still dominated by systems with a thin - disk sed , and since it matches the observed optical luminosity function by construction , its predictions at other wavelengths are close to those of the  and  models",
    ". however , the high space density of high mass black holes leads to a high median mass of active black holes at fixed luminosity , similar to that of  at low luminosities and higher still at high luminosities .",
    "merger driven distortions of the mass function also lead to distinctive redshift and luminosity dependence of the host space density .",
    "finding parameters that yield significant adaf growth and an acceptable match to the optical luminosity function proves quite difficult , requiring an artificial boost to the probability of accretion rates below @xmath68 . with our adopted parameters ,",
    "the adaf model predicts a large amount of black hole growth between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and thus a high @xmath5 and @xmath326 at @xmath9 . with the combination of high @xmath92 and high probability of low @xmath3 ,",
    "the adaf model predicts the largest median black hole masses and lowest median accretion rates at fixed luminosity , with the median accretion rate approaching @xmath68 even for high luminosity agn at @xmath509 .",
    "the high x - ray fraction of the adaf sed boosts the soft and hard x - ray luminosity functions relative to the optical , especially at low redshift , and the model predicts that a majority of x - ray selected systems at @xmath510 should be adaf accretors , even at high luminosities .",
    "this prediction appears observationally untenable , and the model requires rather implausible parameter choices in the first place , so our results suggest that adafs are unlikely to make an important contribution to black hole growth in the real universe , even at @xmath7 ( @xcite [ @xcite ] reach a similar conclusion ) .",
    "low radiative efficiency at low @xmath3 may nonetheless help explain the remarkable quiescence of most black holes in the local universe @xcite .",
    "our results illustrate how a variety of observational constraints can be brought to bear on the key questions of quasar and black hole evolution .",
    "in particular , we have extended the ideas of @xcite and @xcite to show that incorporating the link between luminous accretion and black hole growth allows one to construct concrete physical models that are simultaneously constrained by multi - wavelength luminosity function measurements and estimates of black hole masses and accretion rates .",
    "for our models in  [ sec : illus ] , we chose a plausible but not unique set of initial conditions at @xmath8 and evolved them forward in time under varying assumptions , always matching the observed optical qlf . the models then make distinguishable predictions for other observables .    with our current parameter choices ,",
    "all of our models face some difficulty when confronted with recent estimates of x - ray luminosity functions and the local black hole mass function , as illustrated in figures  [ fig : comparenofm ] , [ fig : comparesxdata ] , and [ fig : comparehxdata ] .",
    "models that fit the @xcite hard x - ray qlf generally do not fit the @xcite soft x - ray qlf at the same redshift , and vice versa .",
    "a model incorporating luminosity and redshift dependence of the obscured quasar fraction might fare better , though some of the problem may still lie with the observational estimates themselves .",
    "combining tremaine et al.s ( @xcite ) estimate of the @xmath421 relation with sheth et al.s ( @xcite ) estimate of the distribution of galaxy velocity dispersions yields a mass function that lies well below our model predictions for @xmath511 , unless the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath421 relation is @xmath512 dex , compared to tremaine et al.s estimate of @xmath513 dex .",
    "repairing this discrepancy would require either reducing the break mass at @xmath8 substantially below @xmath308 or dropping our assumed double power - law form of @xmath5 and adopting a mass - dependent @xmath28 to reproduce the @xcite qlf .",
    "for the present , we do not want to draw strong conclusions from these discrepancies , since we have not thoroughly assessed the observational uncertainties , and we have not investigated the extent to which a failing model can be `` fixed up '' by adjusting its parameters ( e.g. , the initial shape of the black hole mass function ) , while retaining its essential features ( e.g. , a large fraction of obscured systems ) .",
    "the @xmath9 black hole mass function can be reasonably well estimated from current data , at least at masses @xmath514 where the form and scatter of the @xmath421 relation are well constrained , and it is a fundamental boundary constraint on any evolution model . for a comprehensive attempt to match observations , therefore , it probably makes sense to impose this constraint _ a priori _ on all models , and integrate the evolutionary equations _",
    "backward _ in time . in our framework , this approach is just as easy as integrating forward , even if it is less intuitive . in effect , one takes the known black hole mass function today , infers the accretion rate distribution by matching the luminosity function , steps backward by removing the implied amount of mass from each bin of the mass function , and repeats .",
    "we will apply this approach to available observations in future work . given the inevitable uncertainties in the observational data , radiative efficiencies , and bolometric corrections ,",
    "there are likely to be some degeneracies in the solutions , but we can hope that models that differ in fundamental rather than incidental features will remain observationally distinguishable . based on the results found here , we suspect that the primary source of uncertainty will be the mass dependence of @xmath11 , which requires accurate measurements of both the qlf and the masses of active black holes to pin down empirically .",
    "mergers look like the other most difficult problem , though in this case there are good theoretical ideas about what the merger rates of dark halos and galaxies should be ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and these can be incorporated into model calculations .    the traditional picture of quasars as a population of supermassive black holes growing by accretion seems more secure than ever .",
    "many open questions remain about the roles of black hole mass , accretion rate , radiative efficiency , and sed shape in determining quasar luminosities , about the properties of accretion flows at low and high accretion rates , about the importance of black hole mergers and obscured accretion as drivers of black hole growth , and about the relations among populations observed at different wavelengths .",
    "our work highlights a number of areas where observational advances will be crucial to answering these questions .",
    "these include improved determination of the local black hole mass function , better understanding of the dependence of radiative efficiency and sed shape on accretion rate , measurements of the luminosity function at different wavelengths over the widest achievable range in luminosity and redshift , estimates of masses and accretion rates of active black holes as a function of redshift and luminosity , and indirect estimates of black hole space densities from host galaxy and quasar clustering studies .",
    "fortunately , the observational situation is advancing rapidly , and many of these areas have seen substantial progress in the last few months alone , as discussed in  [ sec : illus ] .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the value of luminosity function determinations and black hole mass estimates that traverse the break in the qlf and extend as far below as possible .",
    "accurate characterization of this regime is crucial for separating the roles of @xmath5 and @xmath28 in shaping the luminosity function , which in turn is necessary for understanding the contribution of sub - eddington accretion rates to black hole mass evolution .",
    "these lower luminosities are also where optical and x - ray evolution appear to be radically different , and better measurements of the joint x - ray , optical , and ir luminosity functions are needed to pin down the origin of these differences .",
    "the emerging data on black hole and quasar evolution are complex , complementary , and rich .",

    "for the double power - law @xmath28 and double power - law @xmath5 , the convolution integral  ( [ eqn : lumfun ] ) for the luminosity function must be broken into three different regimes to account for the different efficiencies of the accretion modes .",

    "the calculation is analogous to that in  [ sec : powerlawpofmdot ] , though more tedious , and we omit the details .",
    "the solution depends on whether @xmath125 lies in the thin - disk , super - eddington , or adaf regimes . for the first case , which is the one usually relevant to our models , the results for the three accretion modes are ( l)_se= \\ {    ll l ( b+1 ) ^b ( l l ) ^ & + [ 3 mm ] l ( b+1 ) ^b ( l l ) ^ &    .

    "[ eqn : sol : dblpow : adaf ] where the values @xmath69 , @xmath468 , and @xmath467 are explicitly included in the solutions .",
    "the three regimes differ because of the different dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath3 and because @xmath125 lies in the thin - disk regime , breaking that integral into more parts .",
    "note that the slopes at the high and low luminosity end of each mode are equal to the mass function slopes ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) , for the reasons discussed in ",
    "[ sec : powerlawpofmdot ] .",
    "we gain some insight into results for general @xmath28 and @xmath5 by considering cases in which @xmath516 is a pure power - law in some range @xmath517 and @xmath518 is a pure power - law in some range @xmath519 .",
    "analysis of such cases reveals a number of critical slopes where the character of the solutions changes . for the critical @xmath28 slope @xmath127",
    ", each logarithmic range of @xmath3 contributes equally to black hole growth and , if @xmath65 is constant , to emissivity of the quasar population .",
    "when @xmath520 , growth and emissivity are dominated by low accretion rates ( near @xmath33 ) , and when @xmath521 high accretion rates ( near @xmath34 ) dominate .",
    "our double power - law models have a low-@xmath3 slope @xmath522 and a high-@xmath3 slope @xmath523 , so that the largest contributions to growth and emissivity are from accretion rates near @xmath125 , which we usually take ( at least at high redshift ) to lie in the thin - disk range @xmath524 .",
    "these parameter choices make our results relatively insensitive to our assumptions about efficiencies and the form of @xmath28 in the adaf and super - eddington regimes .",
    "however , low-@xmath3 or high-@xmath3 accretion may be more important in the real universe , at least at some redshifts , in which case the form of @xmath28 and behavior of the accretion physics in these regimes would have a larger impact on observable properties of the quasar population .",
    "the distribution of active black hole masses at a fixed luminosity depends on both the @xmath28 and @xmath5 slopes . when @xmath168 and @xmath525 , the black hole mass function is steep enough that low mass black holes with high accretion rates predominate ( eq .  [ eqn : relmassdist ] )  i.e. , the most common black holes at a given luminosity @xmath45 are either those with @xmath526 or those with the maximum accretion rate and @xmath527 .",
    "conversely , when @xmath169 , high mass black holes with low accretion rates predominate . for more general forms of @xmath5 and @xmath28 ,",
    "the roles of `` minimum '' and `` maximum '' values are in practice played by values where the slope of the distribution changes or where there is a break in efficiency .",
    "for example , if @xmath168 and the power - law behavior of @xmath28 extends to @xmath479 , then decreasing efficiency in the super - eddington regime comes into play , and the luminosity function is dominated by black holes radiating near the eddington luminosity .",
    "this is the typical behavior for our double power - law models at high redshift , where @xmath125 is close to unity and the low-@xmath3 slope of @xmath28 and high mass slope of @xmath5 easily satisfy @xmath528 . at low redshift",
    "we have low values of @xmath125 , so the high-@xmath3 slope of @xmath28 becomes important . even here",
    "we usually have @xmath529 , so that systems with @xmath530 dominate the high luminosity end of @xmath87 , but because the slopes that we adopt ( @xmath153 , @xmath130 ) are not so far from the critical relation , systems at a given luminosity span a wide range of black hole masses and accretion rates .",
    "two more critical slopes arise when we ask whether the space density of black holes of mass @xmath1 increases or decreases with time .",
    "if accretion drives the evolution of @xmath5 , then the critical slope is @xmath337 : for a mass function steeper than @xmath531 , accretion increases @xmath5 , while for a shallower slope the number of black holes `` lost '' to higher masses exceeds the number gained from lower masses , driving @xmath5 down with time . for merger driven growth , the corresponding critical slope is @xmath338 , at least if objects merge with others of equal mass as in the simple models considered here .",
    "the difference in slopes arises because accretion adds mass to the black hole population while mergers do not , and the critical slope for mergers is steeper still if black hole ejection or gravitational radiation reduce the mass of the surviving merger product below the combined mass of its progenitors . for black hole mass functions",
    "whose asymptotic slopes match the asymptotic slopes of the @xcite luminosity function , mergers drive @xmath5 up in the high mass regime and down in the low mass regime .",
    "accretion increases @xmath5 in both regimes , but the increase is slow for low masses and rapid for high masses ."
