    "blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars have long been important objects of study as tracers of the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "their constant absolute magnitude allows accurate space positions to be determined .",
    "historically , many researchers have used samples of bhb stars , or other standard - candle stars such as rr lyraes , to study the local halo , i.e.  the vicinity of the solar neighborhood where typical distances are of order the solar galactocentric radius @xmath10 .",
    "these samples can be used to constrain the kinematics of the local halo @xcite . the distant halo ( i.e.  typical distances @xmath11 ) , however , is less well constrained ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "isolating a sample of distant bhb stars would enable study of the structure and kinematics of the galactic halo on larger scales ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) , and estimates of the mass of the galaxy .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , currently halfway through a photometric and spectroscopic survey of a quarter of the sky , offers an excellent opportunity to isolate and study bhbs .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey targets objects between about @xmath12 = 15.5 to 19 ( the bright limit is set to avoid contamination in adjacent spectroscopic fibers at the slit end of the fiber bundle ) , although a significant number of stars outside this range is also observed",
    ". thus bhb stars at distances from @xmath13 to @xmath14 from the sun appear in the spectroscopic survey .",
    "this paper presents @xmath15 bhb stars selected from sdss that probe the outer halo .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "pertinent characteristics of the sloan digital sky survey are summarized in  [ s : sdss ] . ",
    "[ s : color_cut ] describes the preliminary color cut . ",
    "[ s : balmer_cut ] discusses spectroscopic bhb classification criteria . for the faint stars , the spectroscopic classification breaks down",

    "[ s : sanity_checks ] , including an analysis of the limited proper motion data available , and a map of the galactic halo which shows the conspicuous sagittarius tidal stream ( figure  [ f : map_3d ] ) .",
    "the results are summarized in  [ s : summary ] .",
    "the sample is available in table  [ t : data ] in the electronic version of this paper .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : * ? ? ? * ) is a project to image about 1/4 of the sky at high galactic latitude to a depth of about 21 to 22 magnitudes in five broad bands covering the entire optical range and to obtain spectra of about a million galaxies and 100,000 quasars selected from the imaging data .",
    "while galaxies and quasars are the primary targets of the spectroscopic survey , the sdss also obtains a vast amount of stellar data .",
    "stellar spectra are acquired by several routes : observations of calibration stars , observations of various classes of star to be used as `` filler '' observations when a given region of sky has too low a density of primary targets , and via objects targeted as candidate galaxies and quasars that turn out to be stars .",
    "the sdss uses a dedicated 2.5 meter telescope and a large format ccd camera @xcite at the apache point observatory in new mexico to obtain images almost simultaneously in five broad bands ( @xmath16 ) centered at 3551 , 4686 , 6166 , 7480 , and 8932  respectively @xcite .",
    "the imaging data are automatically processed through a series of software pipelines which find and measure objects and provide photometric and astrometric calibrations to produce a catalogue of objects with calibrated magnitudes , positions and structure information .",
    "the photometric pipeline photo ( * ? ? ? * and in preparation ) detects the objects , matches the data from the five filters , and measures instrumental fluxes , positions and shape parameters . the last allow the classification of objects as `` point source '' ( compatible with the point spread function [ psf ] ) , or `` extended . ''",
    "the instrumental fluxes are calibrated via a network of primary and secondary stellar flux standards to @xmath17 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "we use the `` psf magnitude , '' which represents the magnitude of the best - fit psf to the object , as determined by photo version 5.4.25 ( 2003 june ) .",
    "the psf magnitudes are currently accurate to about 2% in @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and 3 - 5% in @xmath20 and @xmath21 for bright ( @xmath22 20 mag ) point sources .",
    "the sdss is 50% complete for point sources to @xmath23 , and the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the psf is about @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the data are saturated at about 14 mag in @xmath12 , @xmath25 and @xmath19 and about 12 mag in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "astrometric calibration is carried out using a second set of less sensitive ccds in the camera , which allows the transfer of astrometric catalogue positions to the fainter objects detected by the main camera .",
    "absolute positions are accurate to better than @xmath26 in each coordinate @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey is carried out by targeting objects selected from the imaging catalogues according to pre - determined and carefully tested criteria @xcite .",
    "the targeted stars , quasars and galaxies have limiting magnitudes of around @xmath27 mag @xcite .",
    "bhb stars appear in the sdss spectroscopic sample via two main routes . at redshifts around 2.7",
    ", the quasar color locus crosses the bhb color locus @xcite and many bhb stars are targeted as candidate quasars .",
    "bhb stars are also photometrically selected to serve as filler observations in regions of the sky with a low density of primary targets .",
    "the sky locations of the target objects are mapped to a series of plug plates which feed a pair of double spectrographs ( a. uomoto , s. smee et al .",
    "unpublished ) via optical fibers .",
    "the spectrographs jointly observe 640 objects ( including sky positions and standard stars ) simultaneously , and provide continuous wavelength coverage from about 3800  to 9500  at a resolution of about @xmath28 .",
    "the nominal total exposure time for each spectroscopic plate is 45 minutes ( 15 minutes @xmath29 3 exposures ) , plus observations of flat field and arc standard lamps for every plate .",
    "the entrance aperture of the fibers is @xmath30 .",
    "the spectra are matched to the photometric objects using a video mapping system for the plug plates ( d. schlegel and d. finkbeiner , unpublished ) .",
    "the spectra are recorded on ccd detectors .",
    "the data are optimally extracted , the sky spectrum is subtracted , and wavelength , flat - field and spectrophotometric calibrations are applied automatically by the spectro-2d software pipeline , written by d. schlegel and s. burles ( unpublished ) .",
    "each spectroscopic plate is a circle of diameter @xmath31 on the sky .",
    "the present work is based on the data of @xmath32 unique spectroscopic plates taken to date , through 2003 aug 6 .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 plates were observed redundantly , but in defining the bhb sample we exclude redundant observations by adopting the plate with the highest s / n .",
    "however , we use the information from these redundant observations in  [ s : duplicates ] below to evaluate velocity errors .",
    "the radial velocity is found by fitting the spectrum to template spectra , using an automated fitting program ( * spectro_brightstars * ) written by d. schlegel ( unpublished ) .",
    "the basic procedure is as follows .",
    "@xcite have published a catalogue of about a thousand spectra of stars with a wide range of properties ( spectral types , metallicities etc . ) observed at high spectral resolution with the elodie spectrograph .",
    "one version of the elodie spectra is binned to r @xmath34 20,000 and spectrophotometrically calibrated to about 5% .",
    "* brightstars * was used to select template spectra from the sdss data which match the elodie spectra .",
    "these template spectra are typically composites from many sdss spectra , and are set up to provide relatively coarse sampling of the spectral type grid .",
    "the template spectra are aligned to zero heliocentric velocity . each sdss spectrum",
    "is then compared with the template spectra in wavelength space , and the template and wavelength shift that give the best match is automatically measured .",
    "the stars in the present sample were almost all best - fit with spectral types between b6 and a0 .",
    "the radial velocities are corrected to the heliocentric standard of rest , and throughout this paper are denoted @xmath35 .",
    "bhb stars have very characteristic colors in the high - galactic latitude stellar sample observed by the sdss imaging survey , and photometric selection of candidate objects is straightforward .",
    "bhb stars are bluer in @xmath36 than most halo stars because the halo main sequence turnoff lies at spectral type f / g .",
    "the large balmer jump in bhb low - gravity stars gives them redder @xmath37 colors than other blue objects such as low redshift quasars and white dwarfs , and indeed the sdss @xmath20 and @xmath12 filters are specifically designed to provide optimal photometric separation of low - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "the sdss @xmath36 vs.  @xmath37 color - color diagram in figure  [ f : ugr_g18 ] shows all objects in the spectroscopic sample of @xmath32 plates used herein that were subsequently identified as stars by * brightstars * , which is accurate enough that quasars and galaxies are virtually nonexistent in the sample .",
    "( throughout this paper all magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using the maps of @xcite . )",
    "the region occupied by bhb stars is indicated with a `` color cut box , '' with boundaries @xmath38 .",
    "the boundaries of this selection box are similar to those used by @xcite , and figure  [ f : ugr_bhb18 ] ( see  [ s : fainter_stars ] ) shows that our final sample of bright bhb stars is well contained within the boundaries .",
    "stars that lie in this region of color - color space pass what we will refer to as the `` color cut . ''    although bhb stars are effectively selected through the color cut described above , there remains a significant degree of contamination from two other types of star .",
    "the locus of cooler f stars is actually quite outside of the color cut box , to the red in @xmath36 @xcite , but there are so many f stars that they leak into the bhb candidate sample , via intrinsic variations and photometric errors , with numbers comparable to the number of bhb stars . to identify these cooler stars",
    "merely requires a measure of temperature independent of @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "somewhat more challenging to identify are the a - type stars with higher surface gravity @xcite .",
    "these are probably field blue stragglers , which are some 2 magnitudes less luminous @xcite .",
    "while the balmer jump as measured by @xmath37 can separate out many of these stars , some remain in the sample .",
    "they can be removed using their broader balmer lines as described in the next section .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ f : bhb_spectrum ] presents a typical bhb spectrum , showing the deep balmer lines of an a - type star . in this section",
    "we describe two methods for analyzing these lines : the widely used @xmath41 method @xcite and the scalewidth - shape method @xcite .",
    "we focus on the h@xmath42 and h@xmath43 lines because the the h@xmath44 and h@xmath45 lines have lower continuum levels , and the lines above h@xmath43 are much more closely spaced , making the determination of the continuum difficult @xcite .    to analyze the lines , the continuum must first be fitted and divided out . for the @xmath41 method ,",
    "following @xcite , we take the continuum to range from 4000 to @xmath46 with @xmath47 masks covering the positions of the h@xmath42 and h@xmath43 lines .",
    "we then divide the spectrum by the best - fit sixth - order legendre polynomial to this extracted continuum .",
    "finally , the spectrum is boxcar - smoothed with a boxcar length of 5 pixels .",
    "an example normalized and extracted sed is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ f : bhb_spectrum ] .",
    "similarly , for the scalewidth - shape method , we take the continuum extraction rule of @xcite ( which ranges from 3863 to @xmath48 ) and fit to a fourth - order legendre polynomial .",
    "after the continuum is divided out with this prescription , the sed looks very similar to the example sed in the lower panel of figure  [ f : bhb_spectrum ] .",
    "the following terminology is used in this section and throughout .",
    "a `` method '' refers to a general algorithm , which may or may not be desirable for isolated use , which employs one or more `` criteria '' for discriminating bhb stars .",
    "the @xmath41 method and the scalewidth - shape method are presented in the following .",
    "a `` cut '' is a method or combination of methods that we _ actually _ use to eliminate contaminants from the sample .",
    "the combination cut discussed below incorporates the @xmath41 and scalewidth - shape methods .",
    "since bhb stars have low surface gravity , their balmer lines are narrower than the smaller main sequence blue stragglers .",
    "the @xmath41 method discriminates bhb stars from bs stars by determining the value of @xmath41 , the width in angstroms of the balmer line at 80% of the continuum @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : d02_demo ] demonstrates how this parameter can discriminate a bhb from a bs star .",
    "although simple , this method has been found to be fairly robust and can provide a better measurement of the linewidth than other more complicated procedures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath41 method nominally only applies to objects with a - type spectra .",
    "however , as mentioned in @xmath49[s : color_cut ] , a large contaminant of our sample is f stars .",
    "since f - type stars have weaker balmer lines than a - type stars , one way of measuring temperature is by measuring the depth of the h@xmath42 or h@xmath43 line .",
    "here we define @xmath50 as the flux relative to the continuum at the minimum of the line .",
    "thus , higher values of @xmath50 for the balmer lines signify cooler stars .",
    "a plot of @xmath41 vs.  @xmath50 for stars passing the color cut is shown in figure  [ f : d02_v_fm ] . in this figure , only stars with @xmath12 magnitudes @xmath51 are shown , so that the trends in the plot are not obscured by the noise in the data of fainter stars ( see figure  [ f : g18_breakdown ] , to be discussed in ",
    "[ s : criteria ] ) .",
    "the concentration of stars near @xmath52 represents the bhb stars , and those stars with larger values of @xmath41 are bs stars .",
    "figure  [ f : d02_v_fm ] also suggests that the locii of bs and bhb stars propagate to larger @xmath50 and smaller @xmath41 until the two locii converge at about @xmath53 . in other words , for a given @xmath54 , the distribution of stars in @xmath41 is bimodal , but the stars are most cleanly separated for the smaller values of @xmath50 and not separated at all when @xmath55 .",
    "even though figure  [ f : d02_v_fm ] does nt show the trend clearly , we return to this point in  [ s : criteria ] and show that the stars with smaller values of @xmath41 but with @xmath56 are the other horizontal branch stars ; rr lyraes , for example , fall into this region of the horizontal branch . because horizontal branch stars are evidently more difficult to discriminate from main sequence stars at lower temperatures , we adopt the criteria @xmath57 for likely bhb stars for the h@xmath43 @xmath41 method .",
    "@xcite have proposed the scalewidth - shape method for discriminating bhb stars based on the srsic profile for balmer lines @xcite : @xmath58}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath59 is the normalized flux and @xmath60 is the wavelength in @xmath61 .",
    "we fit the normalized extracted spectrum ( where the bounds of extraction are given by @xcite ) to the srsic profile with three free parameters : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 is assumed to be the nominal location of the balmer line corrected for redshift , which has already been determined .",
    "after fitting both balmer lines of every star to the three - parameter ( @xmath65 ) srsic profile , there is a reasonably small dispersion in the determination of @xmath66 : for the @xmath67 line the average is @xmath68 and the root - mean - square ( rms ) is @xmath69 ; for @xmath70 the average is @xmath71 and the rms is @xmath72 .",
    "we fix @xmath66 at its average value among stars passing the bhb criteria of the h@xmath43 @xmath41 method , which is not objectionable because the @xmath41 method is independent of the scalewidth - shape method .",
    "the balmer lines are then refitted to the two - parameter ( @xmath73 ) srsic profile .",
    "this refitting is important because errors in @xmath66 are correlated with the errors in @xmath74 and @xmath63 @xcite . for this work",
    "we adopt @xmath75 for the h@xmath42 line and @xmath76 for the h@xmath43 line .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath66 most likely depends on the resolution of spectroscopy and similar factors .",
    "fitting to the srsic profile thus provides the two parameters @xmath74 and @xmath63 for both the h@xmath42 and h@xmath43 lines , for every star .",
    "@xcite show that bhb and bs stars separate rather cleanly in a plot of @xmath74 against @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , they show that @xmath63 is a measure of temperature : cooler stars have smaller values of @xmath63 .",
    "we concentrate on the set of brighter stars with @xmath1 because the noise in the spectra of fainter stars throws large errors in the parameter determinations for the @xmath41 method and the scalewidth - shape method .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure  [ f : g18_breakdown ] .",
    "we will return to the selection of bhbs from the fainter star sample in ",
    "[ s : fainter_stars ] .",
    "figure  [ f : compare1 ] shows the parameters of the sample of bhb candidates with @xmath1 as determined by the two linewidth analysis methods described in the preceding sections .",
    "each star is represented by the same color in all four panels . in this figure",
    "the h@xmath43 @xmath41 method is represented in the lower left panel , and stars which pass the bhb criteria for this method are colored blue , stars which are likely blue stragglers are green , and all others ( cooler stars ) are red .",
    "it is readily apparent that the four _ independent _ parameter spaces map bhb stars , bs stars , and cool stars to different regions .",
    "the exact bhb criteria for each method were determined through a combination of adjusting the bounds of the criteria by eye and comparing the results of one method to the others .",
    "for instance , the scalewidth - shape method separates bhb and bs stars cleanly enough that there is a natural gap between the two distributions in a plot of @xmath74 vs.  @xmath63 , as shown in figure  [ f : compare1 ] .",
    "a parabola is qualitatively drawn to divide the two distributions .",
    "similarly , with regard to the @xmath41 method , the distribution in @xmath41 of the stars with low values of @xmath50 naturally separates into the two populations of bhb and bs stars .",
    "the issue of where to draw the temperature criterion ( @xmath50 for the @xmath41 method and @xmath63 for the scalewidth - shape method ) is more sensitive because the `` natural '' gap is harder to see in the @xmath41 method and seems to be nonexistent in the scalewidth - shape method .",
    "in fact , the upper right panel of figure  [ f : compare1 ] hints that the division between stars with low surface gravity and high surface gravity continues even for much cooler stars than bhb stars .",
    "the cooler population ( @xmath77 ) with lower surface gravity ( lower @xmath78 ) is thus the horizontal branch stars which are not blue , e.g.  rr lyraes .",
    "this @xmath74 vs.  @xmath63 plot corroborates the evidence in ",
    "[ s : d02_method ] that non - blue horizontal branch stars form a locus in the @xmath79 plane which extends out to cooler temperatures corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "figure  [ f : compare_rhb ] shows that the stars of the population that has smaller values of @xmath78 also have smaller values of @xmath41 . with this information",
    ", we deduce that the bhb stars are located in the clump in the h@xmath43 @xmath80 plane centered on @xmath81 and we set the temperature criterion at @xmath82 . a subsequent inspection of figure  [ f : compare1 ]",
    "reveals that most bhb stars have @xmath83 , so we adopt this as the temperature criterion for the h@xmath42 scalewidth - shape method .",
    "table  [ t : criteria ] lists the adopted bhb selection criteria for each method .",
    "we define the combination cut as those stars which pass the criteria for ( the h@xmath42 @xmath41 and h@xmath43 scalewidth - shape methods ) or ( the h@xmath43 @xmath41 and h@xmath42 scalewidth - shape methods ) .",
    "we assume that the h@xmath42 @xmath41 and h@xmath43 scalewidth - shape methods are completely independent of each other , as are the h@xmath43 @xmath41 and h@xmath42 scalewidth - shape methods .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because no information is shared in the analyses of either line , and the @xmath41 and scalewidth - shape methods measure fundamentally different properties of the spectral energy distribution . under this assumption ,",
    "the contamination fraction for the combination cut would be @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the contamination fraction of a single method . in appendix  [ s : contamination ] we show that the contamination fraction of any one of the four methods is probably @xmath86 , so @xmath87 under these assumptions .",
    "however , to be more conservative , the fact that @xmath88 for all four individual methods suggests that @xmath89 is probably @xmath4 or less ; in paper  ii we use @xmath90 to study errors introduced by contamination into the kinematic analysis .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : g18_breakdown ] , the linewidth analysis methods can not be expected to perform accurately for fainter stars than @xmath91 ; in fact the number of @xmath3 stars that are identified differently in any two methods ( @xmath92 ) is of the same order as the number of @xmath3 stars identified as bhb stars in one method ( @xmath93 ) . because these fainter stars have noisier spectra , not only are the algorithmic bhb criteria unreliable , but eye - inspection would be difficult at best",
    ". however , an inspection of the results of the combination cut applied to the bright ( @xmath1 ) stars , as shown in figure  [ f : ugr_bhb18 ] , reveals that bhb stars , bs stars , and cooler stars occupy different regions of color - color space , although there is significant overlap . in this",
    "figure bhb stars are defined as those which pass the combination cut ; ( green ) bs stars are defined as those which do not pass the combination cut but lie in the bs region for the h@xmath43 @xmath41 method ; and red stars are everything else . the thick curved line with periodic circles will be explained in  [ s : absmag ] .",
    "the bounds of this particular plot are the same as the color cut discussed in  [ s : color_cut ] , so it is evident that the bhb stars are more likely to be found in the region enclosed by the `` piano '' shape indicated than outside of it . since sdss photometry can be expected to be accurate to a fainter magnitude ( @xmath94 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than can the combination method ( see figure  [ f : g18_breakdown ] ) , we select bhb stars with @xmath3 solely on the basis of color . the new color cut is indicated by the piano shape in figure  [ f : ugr_bhb18 ] ( and is given by the region @xmath95 excluding the elliptical subregion @xmath96 ) and will be referred to here as the `` stringent '' color cut .",
    "what are the contamination and incompleteness for the stringent color cut with no spectroscopic analysis ? assuming that the combination cut is 100% accurate for @xmath1 , there are @xmath0 bhb stars , @xmath97 of which do not pass the stringent color cut .",
    "there are @xmath98 stars that pass the stringent color cut that are not classified as bhb stars by the combination method .",
    "most of these ( @xmath99 ) are classified as blue stragglers by the h@xmath43 @xmath41 method .",
    "thus the contamination for the stringent color cut alone is @xmath100 .",
    "since the spectroscopic plates overlap on the sky , sometimes objects are targeted for spectroscopy on two different plates . of the @xmath101 stars passing the color cut ( from _ unique _ plates ) , @xmath102 are duplicate observations of the same star on different plates .",
    "we remove these @xmath102 redundant observations from our bhb sample .",
    "in addition , from the data of the @xmath33 non - unique plates ( see  [ s : sdss ] ) , there are @xmath103 stars passing the color cut which duplicate observations of stars from the unique plates .",
    "each spectroscopic observation of a star provides an independent measurement of radial velocity @xmath35 and , for the bright ( @xmath1 ) stars , an independent classification as a bhb star or non - bhb star .",
    "figure  [ f : duplicates ] shows the @xmath104 stars which have multiple spectra and therefore independent determinations of @xmath35 .",
    "the ordinate axis shows the difference in the radial velocity determinations @xmath105 between each duplicate star and its corresponding star in our purified sample of unique stars .",
    "stars which are classified as bhbs for both observations are colored blue , stars which are classified as non - bhbs for both observations are colored red , and stars which have conflicting classifications between the two observations are colored green .",
    "brighter than @xmath106 , there are @xmath107 stars which are doubly classified as bhbs , @xmath108 stars which are doubly classified as non - bhbs , and @xmath109 stars which have conflicting classifications .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath4 contamination determined in appendix  [ s : contamination ] , assuming that there is about an equal number of contaminants in the bhb sample as the number of bhb stars which are not classified as such ( i.e. , assuming @xmath110 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : duplicates ] also shows the dependence of velocity errors on magnitude ; as expected , fainter stars tend to have greater velocity errors , presumably due to noiser spectra .",
    "the rank correlation coefficient of @xmath111 is @xmath112 .",
    "the velocity differences determined this way turn out to be consistent with the errors derived from the spectral fits for only about half of the stars , independent of the magnitude or whether or not a star is a bhb or bs star .",
    "this comparison implies that the errors have been underestimated and this is currently under investigation .",
    "the rms of @xmath105 in figure  [ f : duplicates ] is @xmath113 .",
    "clearly the errors in radial velocity measurements are not gaussian , but a meaningful approximate result may still be obtained if they are assumed to be so .",
    "since the distribution of @xmath105 is based on the errors of two measurements , the error of one measurement is approximately @xmath114 .",
    "in order to refine our photometric distance estimates , we have computed theoretical colors and bolometric corrections for bhbs .",
    "we integrate the latest kurucz model atmospheres ( downloaded from www.kurucz.harvard.edu ) against the sdss filter response functions at a standard airmass of 1.2 atmospheres , in the manner described by @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", the latter authors report only colors , so it was necessary to repeat their calculations in order to obtain the bolometric corrections . apart from wavelength ,",
    "the kurucz spectra are functions of three parameters : effective temperature @xmath115 , surface gravity @xmath116 , and metallicity relative to solar @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "to derive absolute magnitudes and bolometric corrections , it is necessary to assume a relationship between the luminosity @xmath118 and @xmath115 .",
    "the models of @xcite for the theoretical zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) at @xmath117\\le-1.5 $ ] can be summarized roughly by @xmath119 over the range @xmath120 . from a detailed study of the horizontal branch of m5 , however , @xcite find that luminosity varies more weakly with @xmath115 ; in fact their results appear to be consistent with constant luminosity and mass , @xmath121 with a scatter of no more than @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively , over the same temperature range .",
    "we adopt the mean values in equation ( [ e : mlrels ] ) , so that @xmath124 .    to give an idea of the theoretical uncertainties , we note that if in fact the relation ( [ e : zahb ] ) holds for our hb stars , then by adopting ( [ e : mlrels ] ) we have overestimated their distance moduli by an average of @xmath125 over the indicated range of @xmath115 , and by neglecting the variation of @xmath118 with @xmath115 ,",
    "we have increased the scatter in distance modulus by @xmath126 , which should be taken in quadrature with the photometric measurement error .",
    "the results of this exercise are shown in table  [ t : thb ] .",

    "we define the most probable absolute magnitude associated with its @xmath128 colors by simply finding the absolute magnitude of the point on the theoretical track that is closest to the observed star in this color - color space .",
    "the stringent color cut ( piano shape in figure  [ f : ugr_bhb18 ] , see  [ s : fainter_stars ] ) was defined",
    "before the theoretical track was calculated , so the fact that the theoretical track satisfies the stringent color cut is a meaningful consistency check .    as a further consistency check",
    ", we have isolated several galactic globular clusters observed by the sdss photometric survey to date and plotted their color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "pal 3 , ngc 5904 , and ngc 6205 do not show a discernable horizontal branch , so they are not considered here .",
    "the @xmath12 vs.  @xmath36 cmds of pal 5 @xcite and ngc 2419 are presented in figure  [ f : gc_cmd ] , where the distance modulus , derived from cluster distances of @xmath130 and @xmath131 for ngc 2419 and pal 5 , respectively @xcite , has been subtracted from the dereddened apparent magnitude @xmath12 .",
    "stars within @xmath132 of the center of ngc 2419 and within @xmath133 of the center of pal 5 were selected .",
    "the sdss automated photometry avoids analyzing very crowded fields , so the stars presented here , though within the stated radii , tend to lie in the outskirts of the clusters",
    ". vertical lines at @xmath134 indicate our color cut . the theoretical horizontal branch sequence is also plotted in both panels .",
    "the horizontal branch stars of ngc 2419 appear to be systematically fainter than the theoretical prediction , while those of pal 5 seem to be systematically brighter ; however , these systematic differences could easily be due to inaccurate distances @xmath135 . by selecting from these two globular clusters the stars passing the color cut ( @xmath38 ) and lying in the region of the cmd for the horizontal branch ( @xmath136 )",
    ", we compare the directly observed absolute magnitude @xmath137 to the indirectly obtained theoretical absolute magnitude based on the @xmath128 colors . for ngc 2419 , the rms of the differences of",
    "the two among the 94 stars is .134 magnitudes , and the root - sum - square ( rss ) is .167 magnitudes , @xmath138 , @xmath139 . for pal 5 ,",
    "the rms is .126 magnitudes and the rss is .202 magnitudes .",
    "the difference between the rms and rss is due to the nonzero mean , or systematic error as discussed above .",
    "therefore , the magnitude error of a star , with absolute magnitude determined by comparison to the theoretical horizontal branch sequence described above , is of order .2 magnitudes",
    ". the error may be as small as @xmath140 magnitudes if the only cause of the systematic difference between directly observed absolute magnitudes and our indirectly obtained absolute magnitudes is incorrect distances for pal 5 and ngc 2419 .",
    "as figure  [ f : ugr_bhb18 ] shows , bhb stars determined by the combination cut are in general redder in @xmath39 and bluer in @xmath40 than other objects such as blue stragglers .",
    "this result is consistent with the work of @xcite , so it is reassuring . in this section we present several more sanity checks which verify that our sample of bhb stars is probably accurate .",
    "bhb stars are halo stars , and as such they should have lower metallicity than the disk star contaminants .",
    "the most promising spectral feature to use for a metallicity determination is the caii k line at @xmath141 ( the h line , at @xmath142 , is not used because it is too close to h@xmath143 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is impractical to use the caii k line as a _ reliable _ indicator of metallicity in individual sdss spectra because much higher spectral resolution would be necessary .",
    "however , the following exercise is executed anyway as a sanity check . by employing a continuum - subtraction algorithm very similar to",
    "that described in  [ s : d02_method ] for the h@xmath42 and h@xmath43 balmer lines , we find the value of @xmath50 for the caii k line ; smaller values indicate larger metallicity . figure  [ f : caii ] presents the distributions of this parameter for our sample of bhb stars and non - bhb stars passing the color cut .",
    "the figure shows different distributions for bright ( @xmath1 ) and faint ( @xmath3 ) stars because of the difference in s / n .",
    "reassuringly , our bhb stars tend to have lower metallicities .",
    "the proper motions of objects in sdss are found automatically by matching the stellar positions to those in the astrometric catalogue usno - a v2.0 @xcite derived from the digitized palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) plates , for objects bright enough to have a poss counterpart .",
    "the normalized distribution of the proper motion of spectroscopically confirmed qsos is shown in figure  [ f : pm_dist ] as a thick line .",
    "these alleged proper motions of qsos are obviously due to measurement errors , both from poss and sdss ( primarily from the former ) . if both measurements follow bivariate gaussian errors with radially symmetric variances @xmath144 and @xmath145 , then the distribution of the separation of the measurements ( i.e. , proper motion ) also follows a bivariate gaussian with variance @xmath146 .",
    "thus , the probability density distribution of observing a star with true proper motion @xmath147 at an observed proper motion @xmath148 is @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the modified bessel function of the first kind . since @xmath151 for the qso distribution , the second moment of the distribution of @xmath148 should equal @xmath152 for gaussian statistics .",
    "this determination yields @xmath153 , and the resulting theoretical error distribution function from equation  [ e : proper_motion ] is shown in figure  [ f : pm_dist ] as a thin line .",
    "we have estimated the statistical intrinsic proper motions of our sample using the derived photometric distances .",
    "the transverse velocity of each star was drawn 1000 times at random from an isotropic velocity distribution with dispersion @xmath154 in one dimension and corrected for an assumed solar velocity @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "these choices were based on the kinematic results presented in paper  ii .",
    "the distribution of intrinsic proper motions so derived , @xmath156 , is shown in figure  [ f : pm_dist ] as the dotted line .",
    "the theoretical proper motion distribution for bhb stars with measurement errors should follow the form @xmath157 and is drawn in figure  [ f : pm_dist ] as the dashed line .",
    "the distribution of _ measured _ proper motions of our bhb sample is also shown .",
    "this distribution is clearly not very much broader than that of the qsos ; the second moment yields @xmath158 , which is actually too small to account for the combination of measurement error ( @xmath153 ) and intrinsic proper motion ( @xmath159 ) ! in contrast , the proper motion distribution of a sample of faint ( here @xmath160 ) f stars from sdss is also shown , with a much broader distribution .",
    "this finding demonstrates that contamination in the bhb sample from f stars must be very small .",
    "we estimate that the f star contamination is less than @xmath161 among the 837 stars in our sample that were matched to usno - a . without better understanding of systematic errors",
    ", we can not claim to have detected proper motion of the bhb sample .",
    "however , the usno - b catalog , which has appreciably better data quality than usno - a , will soon be provided as the first epoch for proper motions , so we defer further analysis to later work .",
    "figure  [ f : map_3d ] shows two views of a three - dimensional representation of the locations of the bhb stars .",
    "each star is colored according to its line - of - sight radial velocity with the solar velocity of @xmath162 @xcite added .",
    "these two views compose a stereograph which can be viewed by focusing the eyes on a point midway to the paper .",
    "the three - dimensional positions of the stars are derived from their angular positions and photometric distances (  [ s : absmag ] ) , assuming @xmath163 .",
    "one could search for substructure in the galactic halo by a careful examination of figure  [ f : map_3d ] , and indeed a clump appears in the upper left part of the plot ( at @xmath164 ) .",
    "this clump belongs to the leading arm of the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate this structure in velocity phase space , as shown in figure  [ f : sgr_d_v_v ] .",
    "the sagittarius stream approximately follows the great circle on the celestial sphere with pole @xmath165 or @xmath166 , as determined from the distribution of sdss candidate rr lyrae stars .",
    "practically the same position is implied by the distribution of 2mass m giants @xcite .",
    "this great circle intersects the footprint of the sdss in three places .",
    "these three intersections with bhb stars ( two in the north and one in the south , with a strip width of 10 degrees ) are represented in the three panels in figure  [ f : sgr_d_v_v ] .",
    "one can see a clump in the phase space of the northern subsample representing the sagittarius stream ( left plot ) ; indeed it is the same clump in the upper left of figure  [ f : map_3d ] . the coherent structure in the middle panel ( at @xmath167 )",
    "is also associated with the sgr dwarf tidal stream ( trailing arm ) .",
    "this is the same clump that was discovered by @xcite using a - colored stars , and is also detected in the velocity - distance distribution of sdss candidate rr lyrae stars @xcite .",
    "the fact that we see such structure in the bhb sample strongly indicates that our bhb absolute magnitudes and selection criteria are reliable .",
    "using broadband colors and spectroscopic surface - gravity indicators , we have selected @xmath15 blue horizontal branch stars from the sdss .",
    "for the @xmath0 bright stars ( @xmath5 ) the contamination is probably @xmath168 , and for the @xmath2 faint bhb stars ( @xmath7 ) the contamination is probably @xmath169 .",
    "the absolute magnitude of bhb stars was determined from globular cluster color - magnitude diagrams , and an absolute - magnitude - color relation established .",
    "this was used to estimate photometric distances , with errors @xmath170 mag .",
    "the stars also have measured radial velocities with errors @xmath8 .",
