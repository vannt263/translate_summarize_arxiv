    "hadronic molecules have recently become a hot topic on the study of meson spectroscopy as well - suited candidates for the structure of the so - called xyz states  @xcite .",

    "the main motivation originates from the reduction of the kinetic energy due to large reduced mass as compared to systems made of light baryons",

    "such a project was already undertaken for the interaction between charmed mesons with reasonable predictions  @xcite , what encourages us in the present challenge .",

    "thus , the total potential becomes slightly attractive at intermediate distances but repulsive at short range . in the @xmath43 interaction ,",
    "the presence of a direct ( without simultaneous quark - exchange ) contribution of the ope and the opposite sign of most part of the exchange diagrams , generates an overall attractive potential .",
    "this is rather similar to the situation in the strange sector but with the absence of the one - kaon exchange potential , what gives rise to a less attractive interaction . regarding the character of the interaction , similar results were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite within the quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm ) .",
    "it is important to note at this point the difference with hadronic potential models as those of refs .",
    "@xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "3(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath5 @xmath2 potential is attractive due to the absence of quark - exchange contributions and the dominance of the attraction of the scalar exchange potential . in spite of being attractive ,",
    "the central potential alone is not enough to generate a bound state . in ref .",
    "@xcite they only consider the hadronic one - pion exchange and then , the @xmath2 interaction is zero .",
    "thus all possible attraction comes generated by the coupling to larger mass channels .    as mentioned above ,",
    "when comparing with the similar problem in the strange sector an important difference arises , the absence of the @xmath85 coupling . as a consequence",
    "the mass difference between the two coupled channels in the @xmath5 partial wave , @xmath2 and @xmath43 , is much larger than in the strange sector , making the coupled channel effect less important .",
    "let us note that in the strange sector @xmath86 25 mev and @xmath87 154 mev , this is why the @xmath88 channel plays a relevant role for the @xmath3 system  @xcite , as well as why the @xmath89 state is relevant for the @xmath90 system  @xcite . in the charmed sector",
    "the closest channel coupled to @xmath2 in the @xmath5 state is @xmath43 , 338 mev above .",
    "this energy difference is similar to the @xmath91 mass difference , the coupled channel effect being still important although it may not proceed through the central terms due to angular momentum selection rules  @xcite .",
    "heavier channels play a minor role , as it occurs with the @xmath92 channel , 584 mev above the @xmath1 threshold  @xcite . in the present case",
    "the coupling to the closest channel @xmath43 proceeds through the central potential and one does not expect higher channels , as @xmath93 468 mev above the @xmath2 threshold , to play a relevant role in quark - model descriptions as shown in the qdcsm model of ref .",
    "the situation seems to be a bit different in hadronic models where the non - central potentials are not regularized by the quark - model wave function  @xcite .",
    "let us finally note that the coupling between the @xmath2 and @xmath43 channels comes mainly given by quark - exchange effects and the direct one - pion exchange potential .",
    "thus , it becomes a little bit stronger than in hadronic theories based on the one - pion exchange potential  @xcite .",
    "the resulting interaction is rather similar to that in the strange sector , as can be seen by comparing with fig .",
    "1(b ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the main difference coming from the behavior of the normalization kernel at short distances .            with these ideas in mind and following the procedure described in sec .",
    "[ seciic ] we have performed a full coupled channel calculation of the @xmath5 state .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "in the left panel we show by the dashed line the fredholm determinant of the @xmath2 channel alone .",
    "the fredholm determinant is large , indicating a barely small attractive interaction . when the coupling to the heavier @xmath43 channel is included , solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the system gains attraction , but it is not enough as to get a bound state . the main uncertainty when determining the baryon - baryon interaction in quark models with charmed baryons would be the harmonic oscillator parameter of the charm quark .",
    "we have explored the results for different values of @xmath31 .",
    "the results are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and as can be seen in no case the @xmath5 state would become bound .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the smaller values of @xmath31 are preferred to get consistency with calculations based on infinite expansions , as hyperspherical harmonic expansions  @xcite , where the quark wave function is not postulated .",
    "this also agrees with simple harmonic oscillator relations @xmath94 .",
    "the smaller values of @xmath31 give rise to the less attractive results .",
    "for the larger values of @xmath31 , if a loosely bound state could be generated , the electromagnetic repulsion arising in the @xmath5 channel due to the electric charge of the @xmath95 might dismantle the bound state .",
    "thus , without the strong transition potentials reported in the qdcsm model of ref .",
    "@xcite or the strong tensor couplings occurring in the hadronic one - pion exchange models of refs .",
    "@xcite , it seems difficult to get a bound state in this system .",
    "we have recently illustrated within the quark model  @xcite how the coupled channel effect between channels with an almost negligible interaction in the lower mass channel works for generating bound states .",
    "although for the four - quark problem , in this reference it is demonstrated ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) how when the thresholds mass difference increases , the effect of the coupled channel diminishes , which is an unavoidable consequence of having the same hamiltonian to describe the hadron masses and the hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "we have also analyzed the other @xmath96 channels shown in table  [ tab2 ] with similar conclusions , the weak interaction in the charm sector and the absence of channel coupling between close mass channels works against the possibility of having dibaryons with two units of charm .",
    "for the sake of completeness we have calculated the fredholm determinant for all cases and it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "one should finally note that the problem of double heavy dibaryons has also been approached in the literature by means of six - quark calculations .",
    "the group of grenoble  @xcite addressed this problem within a pure chromomagnetic interaction obtaining several candidates to be bound .",
    "there also interesting results based on relativistic six - quark equations constructed in the framework of the dispersion relation technique  @xcite with a rich spectroscopy of double charmed and beauty heavy dibaryons .",
    "future experimental results will help to scrutinize among the different models , and in this way to improve our phenomenological understanding of qcd in the highly non - perturbative low - energy regime .",
    "this challenge could only be achieved by means of a cooperative experimental and theoretical effort .",
    "in short summary , we have studied the baryon - baryon interaction with two units of charm making use of a chiral constituent quark model tuned in the description of the baryon and meson spectra as well as the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "several effects conspire against the existence of a loosely bound state resembling the @xmath0 dibaryon .",
    "first , the interaction is weaker than in the strange sector .",
    "second , there is no coupling between close mass thresholds , like @xmath85 , the closest threshold being more than 300 mev above .",
    "finally , the existence of a weak attraction may be killed by the electromagnetic repulsion absent in the strange sector .",
    "thus , our results point to the nonexistence of low - energy dibaryons with two units of charm and in particular , to the nonexistence of a stable charmed @xmath0-like dibaryon . given that the interaction in the @xmath5 is attractive , this state may appear as a resonance above the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "weakly bound states are usually very sensitive to potential details and therefore theoretical investigations with different phenomenological models are highly desirable .",
    "the existence of these states could be scrutinized in the future at the lhc , j - parc and rhic providing a great opportunity for extending our knowledge to some unreached part in our matter world .",
