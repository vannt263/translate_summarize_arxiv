    "the study of quarkonia in p+p collisions provides a useful tool for probing heavy quark production mechanisms .",
    "heavy quarks are predominantly generated in hadronic collisions via hard processes involving gluonic diagrams , but the details of hadronization remain unclear . several theoretical models , with varying degrees of success , have been proposed to explain how a heavy quark pair evolves to form a bound quarkonium state .",
    "the color - singlet model generates @xmath4 particles from color singlet @xmath8 pairs that are in the same quantum state as the final @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath4 production cross section is underestimated by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the nrqcd color - octet model @xcite includes color - octet state @xmath8 pairs in addition to color - singlet state pairs that radiate soft gluons during hadronization to form a @xmath4 .",
    "contrary to expectation , the color - octet matrix elements , derived from experimental data , are found to be non - universal @xcite .",
    "additionally , a large transverse polarization is predicted at high @xmath9 that is not observed in the data .",
    "the color evaporation model provides a phenomenological approach to hadronization @xcite .",
    "the charmonium states are formed in proportions determined by experiment for any @xmath8 pair below the @xmath10 threshold and hadronization occurs through the emission of soft gluons . to date",
    ", the most successful model of quarkonia production is a perturbative qcd approach involving 3-gluon mechanisms which is able to reproduce both the experimentally observed @xmath4 cross section and polarization @xcite . within this model ,",
    "the hadronization mechanism includes a channel involving the fusion of a symmetric color - octet state with an additional gluon .",
    "the measurements reported in this paper provide further tests for these production mechanisms .",
    "the phenix experiment is designed to detect heavy quarkonia at forward rapidity ( @xmath0 ) via the @xmath1 decay channel and at mid - rapidity ( @xmath2 ) via the @xmath3 decay channel @xcite . at forward rapidity",
    "the muon detectors are composed of cathode strip tracking chambers in a magnetic field and alternating layers of steel absorber and iarocci tube planes that allow muons to be tracked and reconstructed over an acceptance of @xmath11 . at mid - rapidity the central arm tracking detectors , composed of drift chambers , ring imaging erenkov detectors , and electromagnetic calorimeters , are used to detect electrons in two arms each covering @xmath12 in azimuth . during the 2005 run of the relativistic heavy ion collider the phenix experiment sampled @xmath13 of p+p collisions . from this data set a total of 8000 ( 1500 ) @xmath4 have been reconstructed in the dimuon ( dielectron ) channel @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ jpsi_pt ] , the transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath4 cross section can be mapped to 9 gev/@xmath14 using the new high statistics data .",
    "a comparison of the spectral shapes at mid and forward rapidity reveals that the @xmath9 spectrum is softer at forward rapidity .",
    "this is likely a result of the increased longitudinal momentum at forward rapidity , consequently there is less energy available in the transverse direction .",
    "the spectra are fit with the functional form , , to extract the @xmath15 . at mid - rapidity @xmath16 ( gev/@xmath14)@xmath17 and",
    "the @xmath18 per degree of freedom ( @xmath19ndf ) is @xmath20 . at forward",
    "rapidity @xmath21 ( gev/@xmath14)@xmath22 and the @xmath19ndf is @xmath23 . if the exponent in the fit function is allowed be a free fit parameter a slightly better fit is achieved at forward rapidity , @xmath19ndf = @xmath24 , but the @xmath15 is not significantly modified , @xmath25 ( gev/@xmath14)@xmath22 . the previous results from the 2003 run @xcite yielded a significantly lower @xmath15 at forward rapidity , even though within errors the @xmath9 spectra agree . the increased statistics of the 2005 data allow for an improved understanding of the shape of the @xmath26 spectrum due to the extended range in @xmath9 and the finer binning at low @xmath9 .",
    "the 2003 p+p results have been revisited and it was found that the systematic error was underestimated .",
    "a reanalysis of the 2003 run d+au data is underway to determine how this effects the interpretation of that data set .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath15 found in p+p collisions with that found in au+au and cu+cu collisions as a function of centrality is shown in fig .",
    "[ jpsi_pt ] @xcite .",
    "because the heavy ion @xmath9 spectra only extend to 5 gev/@xmath14 the calculation of the @xmath15 is truncated at 5 gev/@xmath14 for all data sets .",
    "good agreement is found between the peripheral heavy ion data and the p+p measurements .",
    "@xmath27{figure1_left.eps } \\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{figure1_right.eps } \\end{array}$ ]",
    "the rapidity dependence of the @xmath4 cross section has been mapped over the range @xmath28 , fig .",
    "[ jpsi_y ] . the data exhibit a slight flattening over the rapidity range @xmath29 . however , the systematic errors on the mid and forward rapidity points are independent , thus a narrower distribution is not excluded .",
    "a comparison of the shape of the distribution with various parton distribution functions and model calculations @xcite shows that many of the models , including the perturbative qcd approach involving 3-gluon mechanisms , are inconsistent with the steepness of the slope at forward rapidity and the slight flattening observed at mid - rapidity .",
    "@xmath27{figure2_left.eps } \\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{figure2_right.eps } \\end{array}$ ]",
    "in addition to the @xmath4 , the phenix detector has the capability of measuring the @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 quarkonia states in p+p collisions . preliminary phenix measurements of the @xmath7 as a function of rapidity and collision energy are available @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 states is still ongoing .",
    "the 2006 p+p run provides a factor of 3 improvement in the statistics available for these measurements and the results will be forthcoming .",
    "with the existing high statistics data the phenix experiment has entered an era of precision @xmath4 measurements .",
    "the p+p data exhibit several features that provide challenges for production models .",
    "the @xmath9 spectrum has been measured over the range @xmath30 gev/@xmath14 and is softer at forward rapidity than at mid - rapidity .",
    "furthermore , an improved assessment of the @xmath4 @xmath31 is possible with the 2005 data set and good agreement is found between the peripheral heavy ion data and the p+p measurements .",
    "the @xmath4 cross section as a function of rapidity is slightly flat and falls off rapidly at forward rapidity .",
    "this behavior is not well reproduced by the available model calculations .",
    "future phenix data will shed light on these processes and open additional exciting avenues of quarkonia measurements .",
