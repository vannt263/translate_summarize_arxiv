    "in this paper we give versatile new identities for the topological transition polynomial @xmath0 .",
    "we use these identities to obtain new connections between , and interpretations of , the penrose polynomial @xmath2 , and bollobs and riordan s ribbon graph polynomial @xmath1 , and also to explain similarities between known combinatorial evaluations of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we are motivated by some strikingly similar combinatorial interpretations of @xmath2 and @xmath1 in terms of edge colourings of medial graphs .",
    "if @xmath4 is an embedded graph , a @xmath5-valuation of its medial graph , @xmath6 , is an edge @xmath5-colouring of @xmath6 such that each vertex is incident to an even number ( possibly zero ) of edges of each colour .",
    "a @xmath5-valuation of a checkerboard - coloured embedded medial graph yields four possible arrangements of colours about a vertex , which we term white , black , crossing , or total , as in figure  [ f.kval ] .",
    "we let @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the number of total vertices and crossing vertices , respectively , in a @xmath5-valuation @xmath9 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similar arguments give that the second and third sums in equal @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "thus equation equals @xmath12 , which by proposition , is @xmath0 .      in this section",
    "we show that evaluations  [ t.kp][sumcross ] arise as special cases of theorem  [ e.qk ] . for this",
    "we need the following result which shows that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are assimilated by the transition polynomial .",
    "this result provides the unifying framework for explaining the connections among the evaluations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "[ p.qmbr ] if @xmath4 is an embedded graph .",
    "then @xmath15    the specialisation @xmath16 that appears in equation   is significant as it as appears in many results about the ribbon graph polynomial , for example in duality relations ( see @xcite ) and in connections to knot theory ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , admits a recursive deletion - contraction definition @xcite , whereas there is no known deletion - contraction reduction for @xmath17 in general .",
    "proposition  [ p.qmbr ] allows us to unify evaluations  [ t.kp][sumcross ] and to explain their similarities by showing that they are all special cases of theorem  [ t.qk ] .",
    "in fact , this fame work allows us to extend korn and pak s evaluation [ c.qk ] as seen in below .",
    "[ c.qk ] let @xmath4 be an embedded graph , and @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19    we prove equation first .",
    "for this , observe that by equations  , and  , @xmath20 note that @xmath21 , whenever @xmath22 , and is @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "therefore we can sum over @xmath24 and drop the @xmath25 term , giving the result .",
    "equation   follows from equation by setting @xmath26 .",
    "equation   is proved in a similar way to , but using instead of .",
    "we omit the details of this argument .",
    "equation   follows from equation as @xmath3 and @xmath1 agree on plane graphs as in equation .",
    "we have seen that evaluations  [ t.kp][sumcross ] can be recovered from , and even extended by , theorem  [ t.qk ] .",
    "we will now see that theorem  [ t.qk ] can also be used to recover and extend evaluation  [ t.total ] . to do this we exploit the fact that the transition polynomial is well behaved under both geometric and petrie duality .",
    "this fact will allow us to obtain evaluation  [ t.total ] from the special case of theorem  [ t.qk ] that appears in korn and pak s evaluation  [ t.kp ] .",
    "this is a very different approach from that used in the original proof of evaluation  [ t.total ] in @xcite which relied upon a connection between @xmath2 and the circuit partition polynomial of @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the tutte polynomial satisfies a geometric duality relation for plane graphs : @xmath27 .",
    "an analogous geometric duality identity was determined for @xmath0 in @xcite , and a much more general twisted duality identity for @xmath0 was given in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use the following special cases of the twisted duality relation for @xmath0 .",
    "[ t.qdual ] let @xmath4 be an embedded graph .",
    "then @xmath28    the following theorem is a central result in this paper .",
    "it is an easy consequence of propositions  [ p.qmbr ] and [ t.qdual ] .",
    "its importance lies in that it provides a useful connection between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and that it helps explain why they give such similar evaluations .",
    "it shows that once we move into the class of embedded graphs and can leverage twisted duality properties , the penrose polynomial is essentially an evaluation of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , theorem  [ ptoz ] will subsequently lead to additional identities and combinatorial interpretations of evaluations of both polynomials .",
    "[ ptoz ] let @xmath4 be an embedded graph .",
    "then @xmath29    we have @xmath30 where the first equality follows from equation  , the second and third from theorem  [ t.qdual ] , and the fourth from equation  .",
    "we now use theorem [ ptoz ] to expand the class of graphs for which evaluation [ t.total ] applies , and to explain its connection to theorem  [ t.qk ] .",
    "[ total2 ] let @xmath4 be an embedded graph such that @xmath31 is orientable .",
    "then @xmath32    if @xmath4 is orientable , then the @xmath33 s in @xmath34 always appear with even exponents .",
    "thus , if @xmath4 is orientable , @xmath35 where the last equality follows from evaluation  [ t.kp ] . using theorem  [ ptoz ] , when @xmath36 is orientable , we have @xmath37 where the third equality follows since @xmath38 .    to rewrite the @xmath13-permissible @xmath5-valuations of @xmath39 in terms of @xmath14-permissible @xmath5-valuations of @xmath6 , consider figure  [ c4.f.kp1 ] .",
    "an edge @xmath40 in the arrow presentations of @xmath4 and @xmath31 is shown in figures  [ c4.f.kp1a ] and  [ c4.f.kp1b ] .",
    "the top row of the table in figure  [ c4.f.kp1c ] shows the vertex @xmath41 and boundary components of @xmath6 and @xmath42 , with the shading indicating the canonical checkerboard colouring at @xmath41 .",
    "the first column shows , at @xmath41 , the @xmath14-permissible @xmath5-valuations of @xmath6 , and the second column shows the @xmath13-permissible @xmath5-valuations of @xmath42 .",
    "we see from the table that there is a bijection between the @xmath14-permissible @xmath5-valuations of @xmath6 and the @xmath13-permissible @xmath5-valuations of @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , this bijection preserves the number of total vertices in the @xmath5-valuations .",
    "thus , @xmath43 the result then follows .    to see that evaluation  [ total2 ] generalises evaluation  [ t.total ] , observe that @xmath31 being orientable is a weaker condition than @xmath4 being orientable and checkerboard colourable .",
    "for example , let @xmath4 be the embedded graph consisting of one vertex and three non - orientable loops that meet the vertex in the cyclic order @xmath44",
    ". then @xmath31 is orientable ( it is a plane 3-cycle ) , but @xmath4 is neither orientable nor checkerboard colourable . on the other hand , if @xmath4 is is orientable and checkerboard colourable , then @xmath45 is is orientable and bipartite , so @xmath31 is orientable ( every cycle of @xmath45 has even length , so receives an even number of half - twists ) .",
    "although we have focused on @xmath1 in this paper to facilitate connections with the current literature , theorem [ ptoz ] and several of the other results have much simpler formulations in terms of the topochromatic polynomial , which is just a reparameterisation of @xmath13 : @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , equation   becomes simply @xmath47 .",
    "in @xcite , aigner proved the following result which connects the penrose polynomial of a plane graph @xmath4 and the chromatic polynomial @xmath48 of its geometric dual @xmath45 .",
    "[ t.aigner ] let @xmath4 be a plane graph , and @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath50    in @xcite , the authors extended aigner s result by expressing , when @xmath4 is plane , @xmath51 as a sum of chromatic polynomials in which @xmath52 appears as a single summand :    [ n3 ] let @xmath4 be a plane graph .",
    "then @xmath53    we will now complete theorems [ t.aigner ] and [ n3 ] by showing that that penrose polynomial of an arbitrary embedded graph can be written as sum of chromatic polynomials .",
    "this result is a consequence of the combinatorial interpretation of @xmath54 in terms of @xmath5-valuations from evaluation  [ sumcross ] , and hence it follows from theorem  [ t.qk ] .",
    "[ c41.n5 ] let @xmath4 be an embedded graph . then @xmath55    from evaluation  [ sumcross ] , for each @xmath18 we have @xmath56    we now view @xmath4 as a ribbon graph and construct a bijection from the set of admissible @xmath5-valuations of the medial graph @xmath6 to a certain set of colourings of the boundaries of the partial petrials of @xmath4",
    "let @xmath57 be the set of edges corresponding to vertices of @xmath6 with crossings in the admissible @xmath5-valuation @xmath9 .",
    "the cycles in @xmath6 ( which are determined by the colours in the @xmath5-valuation @xmath9 ) follow exactly the boundary components of the partial petrial @xmath58 . moreover ,",
    "the colours of the cycles in the @xmath5-valuation induce a colouring of the boundary components of @xmath58 .",
    "we define a _ proper boundary @xmath5-colouring _ of a ribbon graph to be a map from its set of boundary components to the colours @xmath59 with the property that whenever two boundary components share a common edge , they are assigned different colours .",
    "it is then clear that the map from @xmath9 to @xmath58 defines a bijection between the set of admissible @xmath5-valuations of @xmath6 and the set of proper boundary of the partial petrials of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , this bijection identifies the vertices with crossing states with the edges in @xmath60 .",
    "thus we have @xmath61 a proper boundary @xmath5-colouring of @xmath62 corresponds to a proper face @xmath5-colouring of @xmath62 , and hence to a proper @xmath5-colouring of @xmath63 . since the chromatic polynomial counts proper @xmath5-colourings of a graph , we can then write as @xmath64 the theorem then follows upon observing that @xmath5 is an arbitrary natural number .",
    "theorem  [ n3 ] can be recovered from theorem  [ c41.n5 ] in the case of plane graphs , as , if @xmath65 is odd , then @xmath66 must contain a loop . to see why , draw @xmath4 on the plane , and use this to obtain a plane drawing of the boundary cycles of @xmath67 in the natural way .",
    "the jordan curve theorem implies that two boundary cycles of @xmath62 must cross each other an even number of times in this drawing .",
    "thus , if @xmath65 is odd , some boundary cycle must cross itself , and this corresponds to a loop in @xmath66 .",
    "we have seen that the connection between @xmath68 and @xmath69 of theorem  [ ptoz ] can be used to reveal new properties of the penrose polynomial .",
    "we now use it to uncover properties of @xmath1 , beginning with a new formulation of the four colour theorem .",
    "the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "[ fct1 ] the four colour theorem is true ; 2 .",
    "[ fct2 ] for every connected , loopless plane graph @xmath4 , @xmath70 ; 3 .   [ fct3 ] for every",

    "4 .   [ fct4]for every connected , loopless plane graph @xmath4 , @xmath72 .",
    "corollary  9 of @xcite states that the four colour theorem is equivalent to @xmath73 for all connected , bridgeless plane graphs @xmath4 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath74 for all connected , loopless plane graphs @xmath4 , which , by theorem  [ ptoz ] , is equivalent @xmath75 or , since @xmath4 is connected and has the same rank and number of vertices as @xmath76 , this is equivalent to @xmath77 , which yields the equivalence between items and of the theorem .",
    "the equivalence between items and is shown in a similar way but using the fact from @xcite that the four colour theorem is equivalent to showing that @xmath78 for all connected , bridgeless plane graphs @xmath4 .",
    "the equivalence between items and follows from @xcite , proposition  7 , which says that if @xmath4 is plane and connected , then @xmath79 is equal to the number of face 4-colourings of @xmath4 .",
    "another way to recover new results relies the partial duals of chmutov @xcite and the more general twisted duals of @xcite .",

    "twisted duality , in fact , forms the foundation of most of the results in this paper .",

    "in sections [ ss.dpn ] and [ ss.argp ] we obtained new combinatorial identities for @xmath2 and @xmath1 . since these results relied upon theorem  [ ptoz ] , the evaluations for @xmath1 were all restricted to the specialisation @xmath96 . in this section",
    "we outline a family of connections between the polynomials @xmath14 and @xmath13 that hold for other 1-variable specialisations of @xmath1 , and we describe how these provide new combinatorial interpretations of @xmath1 .",

    ", we will be able to replace the edges of @xmath4 by any graph , using an tensor operation for embedded graphs from @xcite .",
    "we will then use the same process of examining terms and appropriately adjusting the weights to find a general formula for the transition polynomial of a tensor product .",
    "finally , this formula , combined with the previous relations among the various polynomials , will give the desired family of new connections between @xmath14 and @xmath13 and hence new evaluations .",
    "just as with abstract graphs , the intuitive idea of a tensor product @xmath105 of two embedded graphs @xmath4 and @xmath106 is to replace each edge of @xmath4 with a copy of @xmath107 .",

    "writing @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 , then substituting these into ( [ tpproof1 ] ) gives the system of equations in ( [ t.tensor.e1 ] ) , ( [ t.tensor.e2 ] ) , ( [ t.tensor.e3 ] ) to solve for @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 .",
    "the theorem then follows .    at each edge @xmath114 of @xmath4 ,",
    "up to equivalence there are four possible ways to identify and edge @xmath114 of @xmath4 and the distinguished edge @xmath40 of @xmath106 .",
    "these choices are determined by the identifying maps @xmath118 .",
    "this means there are up to @xmath203 different tensor products of @xmath4 and @xmath106 .",
    "a consequence of theorem  [ t.tensor ] is that the transition polynomial , and hence its specialisations , will give the same value on all of these embedded graphs :        although , as mentioned following definition [ qq ] , we did not use the version of @xmath206 from @xcite with locally specified vertex weights here , theorem [ t.tensor ] readily adapts to this more general setting .",
    "in fact , using the same techniques as in the proof of theorem [ t.tensor ] , it is possible to determine the necessary weights at each vertex of @xmath6 to accommodate inserting a different graph at each edge of @xmath4 ( or even at just a single edge ) instead of inserting the same graph @xmath106 at all of them .",
    "let @xmath4 be an embedded graph , and @xmath106 be a connected orientable embedded graph with a distinguished non - loop , non - bridge edge @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath118 be a family of identifying maps",
    ". then @xmath207 where @xmath208 and where @xmath209 and @xmath210 in all of the expressions .",
    "theorem  [ t.tensor ] gives @xmath211 , where @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 are the solutions to equations  - with @xmath212 .",
    "however , as @xmath106 is orientable , the only way for one cycle to cross another is for there to be a crossing transition at some vertex .",
    "since crossing transitions have weight zero , it follows that @xmath213 , and so @xmath129 and @xmath130 can be determined using only and , giving @xmath129 and @xmath130 in terms of @xmath214 and @xmath189 .",
    "the result then follows by using equation   to express the transition polynomial expressions in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "initially , one may expect to be able to adapt the proof of corollary  [ c.hm ] to obtain a tensor product formula for the penrose polynomial , but a little thought shows that this is not the case . the key fact that enabled us to obtain corollary  [ c.hm ] from theorem  [ t.tensor ] was that setting @xmath215 in @xmath216 , gave that @xmath217 in @xmath218 .",
    "however , recalling that the weight system for the penrose polynomial is @xmath219 , if we set @xmath220 in @xmath216 , then it does not necessarily follow that @xmath221 in @xmath218 .",
    "( for example , take @xmath106 to be the plane @xmath127-graph . )",
    "rather than being a hindrance , this is fortunate in that it provides a family of identities that relate the penrose and ribbon graph polynomials . to see this , theorem  [ t.tensor ] and equation",
    "give @xmath222 where @xmath223 if it happens that the solution to gives @xmath217 ( which does indeed occur for particular choices of @xmath106 , such as the plane @xmath127-graph ) then gives that @xmath224 again connecting the ribbon graph and penrose polynomials .",
    "thus , equation   arises from by taking @xmath106 to be the plane @xmath127-graph .",
    "this family of relations between polynomials can then be used to translate between interpretations of , and results about , the two polynomials .",
    "it would be interesting to have a characterisation of the family of 1-variable specialisations of @xmath1 that appear on the right - hand side of equation   and hence can be written as the penrose polynomial of some graph .",
