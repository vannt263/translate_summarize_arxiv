    "the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is surrounded by a nuclear envelope .",
    "the nuclear envelope consists of two bilayer membranes connected by many lipidic pores , which are supported by a protein complex called the nuclear pore complex ( npc ) @xcite .",
    "the npc is an aqueous channel that shows an eight - fold rotational symmetry with an outer diameter of 100 @xmath0 120 nm and a central transport channel with a diameter of @xmath0 40 nm .",
    "the outer nuclear membrane is also connected to the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , which consists of tubular networks and flat membranes . the inner nuclear membrane contains proteins that interact with nuclear lamina , chromatin - associated proteins , and other nuclear proteins . the nuclear lamina is a network of lamin filaments and associated proteins underlying the inner membrane .",
    "both the size of the nucleus and npc density in the nuclear envelope vary among different organisms @xcite .",
    "the average number of npcs in the nuclear envelope of vertebrates is typically 20005000 ( 1020 pores @xmath1m@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , in a single xenopus laevis oocyte nucleus , @xmath3 npcs ( 60 pores @xmath1m@xmath2 ) are found .",
    "yeast have barely 60200 npcs per nucleus ( 1020 pores @xmath1m@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "depletion of nucleoporins such as nsp1 and nic96 induces a significantly decreased npc density @xcite .",
    "the number of the nuclear pores and the area of the nuclear envelope are doubled during interphase @xcite .",
    "for most metazoan cells , the nuclear envelope is disassembled during early mitosis and reassembled to form two daughter nuclei .",
    "in contrast , most fungi cells undergo closed mitosis , in which the nuclear envelope does not disassemble but deforms into a dumbbell shape and is subsequently divided into two @xcite .",
    "thus , the nuclear envelope dynamically changes its shape during mitosis .    during interphase ,",
    "the nuclei of most cells are spherical or ellipsoidal and the npcs have an approximately uniform distribution .",
    "however , blebbed or lobed nuclei are observed in various diseases as well as aging @xcite .",
    "canine parvovirus infection induces the accumulation of the npcs and lamin b1 in the apical side , where new virus capsides are formed @xcite .",
    "whether the nuclear size and shape directly impact chromatin organization and gene expression remains an open question , but some correlations have been reported @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a high - genus vesicle as a basic model system for the nuclear envelope . if the er is removed , the morphology of the nuclear envelope is a spherical stomatocyte of the genus @xmath4 , which can be formed by a single - component membrane .",
    "theoretically , it can be treated as a closed curved sheet that is incompressible but has no shear elasticity ( in a fluid phase ) .",
    "the morphology of genus-0 vesicles has been intensively investigated , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "discocyte , prolate , and stomatocyte , can be reproduced by the minimization of bending energy with area and volume constraints .",
    "other shapes , such as pear and branched tubes , are obtained by the addition of spontaneous curvature or area - difference elasticity ( ade )  @xcite .",
    "compared to the genus-0 vesicles , vesicle shapes with @xmath5 have been much less explored .",
    "besides , most of the previous papers on vesicles with @xmath6 focused on vesicle shapes with @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", higher - genus vesicles have been studied only in two studies , including our previous one @xcite .",
    "the budding of hexagonally arranged pores in polymersomes was investigated experimentally and theoretically in ref .",
    "vesicle shapes with @xmath9 were investigated using dynamically triangulated membrane simulations in our previous study @xcite .",
    "bending - energy minimum states in the absence of volume and other constraints are circular - cage stomatocytes , where @xmath10 pores are aligned along the circular edge of an inner bud . with the volume constraint , the reduction of the vesicle volume results in the formation of a spherical stomatocyte , where the pores are distributed on a spherical bud .",
    "this change in the pore arrangement alters the characteristics of the shape transition for @xmath11 . with an increasing intrinsic area difference",
    ", the circular - cage stomatocyte continuously transforms into a discocyte with a line of @xmath12 pores .",
    "in contrast , at small volumes , a spherical stomatocyte transforms into a ( @xmath10)-hedral shape and subsequently exhibits a discrete phase transition to a discocyte .    in this study , we investigated the conditions for the formation of a spherical stomatocyte with small pores .",
    "we considered a liposome , in which npcs are embedded .",
    "since the npc fixes the pore size in the nuclear envelope , we constrained the maximum pore size by a toroidal ring .",
    "the inside of the vesicle corresponds to the perinuclear space between the outer and inner nuclear membranes . for the nucleus , the inner bud is the nucleoplasm space that contains nucleosomes and nuclear lamina . since the transport through the nuclear pores is regulated by the npcs , the composition of the nucleoplasm is different from outside of the nucleus , cytoplasm . as mentioned above",
    ", the small vesicle volume ( perinuclear volume ) is a sufficient condition , but the volume is not a good control parameter for the nucleus since its volume is shared with the er . the er widely spreads in the cell and its shape and size dynamically change .",
    "hence , we also surveyed other constraints or interactions : the osmotic pressure between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm , repulsion between the pores , and the intrinsic area difference .",
    "we discuss the conditions to stabilize the spherical shape of the nuclear envelope based on our simulation results .",

    "the spontaneous curvature and gaussian bending energy are not taken into account , since the spontaneous curvature vanishes for a membrane whose inner and outer monolayers consist of the same lipid compositions , and the integral over the gaussian curvature @xmath30 is invariant for a fixed topology .    in the ade model",
    ", the ade energy @xmath31 is added as follows @xcite : @xmath32 the areas of the outer and inner monolayers of a bilayer vesicle differ by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 nm ) is the distance between the two monolayers .",

    "the normal vector @xmath52 points from inside of the vesicle to outside .",
    "in a nuclear envelope , the npc fixes the pore radius by binding it from inside .",
    "however , if the positions of membrane vertices are directly constrained by an attractive potential , the vertex diffusion on membrane is intensively suppressed .",
    "therefore , instead we add a ring to surround the pore and this ring determines the maximum pore radius . in this way",
    ", it does not restrict membrane diffusion through the pore so that the ratio of inner and outer membranes can relax into their equilibrium values .",
    "for a genus-@xmath12 vesicle , @xmath10 rings are required since the stomatocyte has @xmath10 pores .",
    "the ring has hard - core excluded volume interaction with membrane vertices as a torus with a major radius @xmath53 and minor radius @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] .",
    "the membrane vertices are forbidden to enter the inside of the ring .",

    "this minor radius is sufficiently large to prevent the membrane penetration . in our previous study",
    "@xcite , we considered a genus-0 vesicle constrained in a sphere . here , the membrane pores are constrained by rings that can move and rotate .    to generate a positive osmotic pressure @xmath55 between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm ,",

    "after equilibration , the pressure @xmath55 is calculated from the equation of the state of an ideal gas , @xmath58 . the volume @xmath59 for the inner particles to move is calculated from 150 snapshots for each condition as follows . for each membrane conformation ,",
    "the particles are moved by monte carlo ( mc ) methods and 4,000,000@xmath56 positions are obtained . the rectangular space to cover these positions is divided into @xmath60 boxes and the number of boxes containing particles is counted .    to investigate the interactions between the pores , a hard - core excluded volume interaction is added between the ring centers and the hard - core radius @xmath61 is varied . unless otherwise specified , no inner particles ( @xmath62 ) and no ring  ring interactions ( @xmath63 ) are employed so that the rings can be overlapped .",
    "in the present simulations , we use @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "these are typical values for phospholipids  @xcite .",

    "last , let us briefly discuss possible applications of our pore - size constraint approach .",
    "neck structures like a nuclear pore can be found in other organelles .",
    "for example , the inner membrane of mitochondrion has numerous invaginations called cristae @xcite .",
    "it is known that the planer cristae are connected to the inner membrane via a narrow tubular neck .",
    "one may use a toroidal ring to restrict this neck radius as a protein model and investigate the cristae structures .",

    "<S> nuclear pores have an approximately uniform distribution in the nuclear envelope of most living cells . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the morphology of the nuclear envelope is a spherical stomatocyte with a high genus . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the morphology of high - genus vesicles under pore - size constraint using dynamically triangulated membrane simulations . </S>",
    "<S> bending - energy minimization without volume or other constraints produces a circular - cage stomatocyte , where the pores are aligned in a circular line on an oblate bud . </S>",
    "<S> as the pore radius is reduced , the circular - pore alignment is more stabilized than a random pore distribution on a spherical bud . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have clarified the conditions for the formation of a spherical stomatocyte : a small perinuclear volume , osmotic pressure within nucleoplasm , and repulsion between the pores . when area - difference elasticity is taken into account , the formation of cylindrical or budded tubules from the stomatocyte and discoidal stomatocyte is found . </S>"
