    "a universal form for the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) has been an actively debated topic for many decades , having far - reaching consequences for our understanding of the star formation process , and more generally , of how to interpret the integrated light we observe coming from unresolved stellar populations in galaxies and star clusters .",
    "on one hand , the environment ( i.e. physical conditions ) for star formation and the evolutionary processes at work can vary significantly from galaxy to galaxy , suggesting that a non - universal imf should not be ruled out . on the other , until recently there was little compelling evidence that could sufficiently isolate the properties of the imf in such unresolved systems , and thus constrain its approximate functional form .",
    "a recent breakthrough was the convincing detection by @xcite of an over - abundance of low - mass stars compared to fiducial imfs .",
    "subsequently , strong evidence for a non - universal imf has emerged from the application of various independent techniques , including gravitational lensing @xcite , stellar dynamical modelling @xcite , and spectral synthesis @xcite .",
    "here we use the imf derived via the stellar dynamical modelling of @xcite to explore whether the imf - a key property of any stellar population - shows any measurable systematic variations with galaxy stellar population parameters , as derived via line - strengths and single stellar population models . this summarises work presented in @xcite and @xcite .     versus the combined index @xmath1mgfe50@xmath2^\\prime$ ] , both measured within an aperture of one eighth of an effective radius .",
    "the colour scale indicates the values of the imf parameter , @xmath3 , which have been adaptively smoothed using a locally - weighted regression technique to show underlying trends in the distribution .",
    "a grid of ssp model predictions from @xcite is shown for a super - solar abundance ratio of [ @xmath4/fe]@xmath5 , as indicated in the lower left of the plot .",
    "solid lines indicate lines of constant age ; dashed lines show constant metallicity . ]",
    "we quantify the mass normalisation of the imf using the imf parameter @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 implies an imf ` heavier ' than the fiducial unimodal power law of the form : @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the nominator of this ratio is derived from fitting dynamical models to the observed integral - field stellar kinematics .",
    "these models account for differing orbital anisotropy between galaxies , and implicitly reproduce the shape and profile of the observed surface brightness to high accuracy .",
    "additionally , the presence of dark matter was explored using various general prescriptions for the halo mass profile , including contracted haloes . in this way ,",
    "the inferred mass - to - light ratio entering into the @xmath3 parameter is dynamical measure of the stars _ only_.",
    "the dynamical models are described in full in @xcite .",
    "the denominator of the @xmath3 parameter is derived from fitting stellar population models to the atlas@xmath0 optical spectroscopy , as described in @xcite . using the penalised pixel fitting method of @xcite , the spectra",
    "are fitted with a ( positive ) regularised linear combination of the stellar population models of @xcite , fitting for age and metallicity as free parameters , and holding the imf of the models fixed at salpeter . with this approach ,",
    "all the information in the spectrum is used to constrain the spread in possible ages and metallicities , and thus accounts for variations in star formation history between different galaxies .    finally , the stellar population parameters are measured using line strengths and the single stellar population ( ssp ) models of @xcite .",
    "these models have variable abundance ratios , encapsulated in the ratio of @xmath4-elements to iron , [ @xmath4/fe ] , in addition to age and total metallicity , [ z / h ] .",
    "the measurements are taken from @xcite , from which we use the central apertures covering @xmath9 to be consistent with existing spectral imf studies .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] presents the averaged distribution of @xmath3 values on the plane of h@xmath10 versus the combined index @xmath1mgfe50@xmath2^\\prime$ ] of @xcite , over plotted with the schiavon model grid for [ @xmath4/fe]@xmath5 .",
    "there is a trend of larger values of the imf parameter ( corresponding to ` heavier ' imfs ) towards weaker h@xmath10 ( older ) , and stronger @xmath1mgfe50@xmath2^\\prime$ ] ( metal - rich ) objects .",
    "the trend , however , is not monotonic , with lower metallicity objects also showing relatively high imf parameter values , on average .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] presents the trends of @xmath3 with the three measured ssp parameters , together with robust linear fits , fit parameters , correlation coefficients ( r ) , and correlation significance ( p ) .",
    "these show weak but significant trends of @xmath3 with age and [ @xmath4/fe ] , and no measured correlation with [ z / h ] . for reference , we over - plot the data points of @xcite in magenta , together with a region showing the slope and 1@xmath11 ( 68% ) scatter derived from applying the same line - fitting procedure to these points . the relation from the atlas@xmath0 points is notably less steep .",
    "stellar population parameters are known to positively correlate with velocity dispersion @xcite , as does @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that accounting for this additional dependency can change the interpretation of what primarily drives the inferred imf variations . to explore this , the right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] show the residual correlations after removing the dependency of the stellar population parameters on velocity dispersion .",
    "this is done by fitting a plane to the three - dimensional distribution of @xmath3 , ssp parameters , _ and _ velocity dispersion simultaneously .",
    "this indeed removes the dependency on age and [ @xmath4/fe ] , and interestingly implies a _ negative _ correlation of @xmath3 with [ z / h ] .",
    "the imf normalisation inferred via stellar dynamics appears to show weaker correlations with the stellar population parameters than studies measuring the imf directly from stellar light .",
    "moreover , accounting for the dependence of stellar population parameters with velocity dispersion removes the apparent trends with age and [ @xmath4/fe ] , while introducing a trend with [ z / h ] .",
    "resolving the differences of imf inferences from independent methods remains a challenge for future work in this field .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank the organisers and attendees for an exceptionally enjoyable conference , and to my colleagues in the atlas@xmath0 team for making this work possible .",
