    "<S> .    specific heat of an electron gas has a linear dependence with temperature and the specific heat coefficient , @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 is the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , @xmath7 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath3 is a linear function of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , various experiments reported finite value of @xmath3 in insulating materials such as vitreous silica , germania , selenium etc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , it was proposed @xcite that in insulating materials the charge carriers can tunnel through the potential barrier among various local minima . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference between the local minima will vary continuously in an amorphous system that leads to a linear term in specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , various studies in manganites reveal large @xmath3 in insulating _ </S>",
    "<S> crystalline _ </S>",
    "<S> compositions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in order to explain such anomalous observations , it was suggested that the dos at @xmath7 is finite but localized that gives rise to finite @xmath3 and insulating transport . </S>",
    "<S> the other suggestion is the possibility of spin glass phase @xcite .     in la@xmath8sr@xmath9mno@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the paramagnetic ( pm ) metallic phase ( a ) at high temperatures undergoes to ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic ( b ) or via short range ( sr ) ordered phase ( c ) to phase - separated ( ps ) metallic ( d ) or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) metallic ( e ) phase , or antiferromagnetic insulating phase ( f ) . </S>",

    "<S> hole doped manganites @xcite , in general , have attracted a great deal of attention during last two decades followed by the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) leading to potential technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , plethora of interesting phases are observed due to the interplay between spin , charge , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> while cmr effect observed at low doping levels , the higher doping regime also displays interesting and complex phase diagram as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) in the case of la@xmath8sr@xmath9mno@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the system lies in the proximity of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states ; phase coexistence is observed in the composition range ( 0.5 @xmath11 0.6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , such systems may lead to spin amorphicity that contributes as finite @xmath3 in the specific heat data .    however , the observation of finite @xmath3 in the insulating materials far away from compositions having phase coexistence is curious . </S>",
    "<S> for example , la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 undergoes a transition from paramagnetic metallic phase to c - type antiferromagnetic insulating phase ( moments in @xmath12-plane are antiparallel and inter - plane coupling is ferromagnetic ) . </S>",

    "<S> the calculations were performed for la@xmath29sr@xmath30mno@xmath31 in the c - type antiferromagnetic phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated dos corresponding to the valence band are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . mn 3@xmath24 states split into @xmath25 and @xmath14 bands due to the crystal field of mno@xmath32 octahedra . </S>",
    "<S> the bonding and antibonding @xmath25 up spin bands are centered around -5 ev and -1 ev , respectively ; the energy separation is about 4 ev . almost equal weight of the @xmath25 partial dos in bonding and antibonding bands indicates its strong mixing with the o 2@xmath23 electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> the down spin partial dos appear above the fermi level as expected for mn@xmath33/mn@xmath34 high spin state . </S>",
    "<S> the bonding @xmath14 bands appear between -4 to -8 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution at the fermi level , @xmath7 arises primarily due to the up spin @xmath14 electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> o 2@xmath23 partial dos has large contributions in the bonding and antibonding energy regions . </S>",
    "<S> the non - bonding o 2@xmath23 contributions appear in the energy range of -1 to -3 ev .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental valence band spectra are shown in fig 4 . </S>",
    "<S> there are three intense discernible features a , b and c in both xp and he ii spectra . </S>",
    "<S> first , we discuss the observations in the room temperature spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the feature a in the xp spectrum appears at slightly higher binding energy compared to that in the he ii spectrum , while the features b and c appear to have similar binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> the feature c intensity is reduced slightly in the he ii spectrum compared to that in the xp spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from mn 3@xmath24 states are dominant in the xp spectrum and that from o 2@xmath23 states are dominant in the he ii spectrum due to photoemission cross section . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these observations suggest strongly mixed character of the features along with a small enhancement in mn 3@xmath24 contribution in feature c. comparing these results with the calculated dos , it is evident that the feature a represents the photoemission signal from bonding bands ( both @xmath25 and @xmath14 ) , the feature b is the non - bonding o 2@xmath23 contributions and the feature c is the antibonding @xmath25 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the peaking of feature a at slightly higher binding energy in the xp spectrum presumably due to the enhanced intensity of the bonding @xmath14 bands contributions at xp energies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a weak feature d can also be observed ( see inset ) in the vicinity of the fermi level , which is dominant in the xp spectra and represent the electronic states having @xmath14 symmetry as evident in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these spectra exhibit negligible intensity at the fermi level suggesting proximity to an insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the results from resistivity measurements .    . </S>",
    "<S> ]    the energy and intensity of the features in xp spectrum remain almost identical down to 130 k ( much below the magnetic transition temperature of 265 k ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the he ii spectra ( normalized by the intensity of non - bonding o 2@xmath23 signal ) exhibit significant spectral weight transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the feature a becomes stronger at lower temperatures with subsequent reduction in intensity of feature c. since the o 2@xmath23 character is dominant in the he ii spectra , these spectral evolution suggests the shift of o 2@xmath23 eigen energies towards higher binding energies . the antiferromagnetic coupling among mn @xmath35 moments in the @xmath12-plane is mediated by o 2@xmath23 electronic states ( superexchange interaction ) . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering leads to a higher degree of localization of the o 2@xmath23 electrons .     </S>",
    "<S> revealing fermi liquid like energy dependence . ]    the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 reveals significant reduction of intensity of the @xmath14 band ( feature d ) indicating an opening of a hard gap in the antiferromagnetic phase . in order to investigate this with better clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we probed this energy region with very high energy resolution of 1.4 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra collected at different temperatures are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidently the intensity at @xmath7 in the room temperature spectrum is weak and a change in intensity is observed near the arrow . to visualize the spectral changes , </S>",
    "<S> we have subtracted all the spectra from the room temperature spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the subtracted intensities shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) exhibit a peak at about 0.3 ev which enhances gradually with the increase in temperature difference . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , it is expected that 0.2 electrons in the @xmath14 bands would pin the fermi level at the lower half of the conduction band as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the experimental results suggests that these electrons have significant local character that leads to the peak at 0.3 ev and weak intensity at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the spectral intensity of this local feature shifts towards higher binding energies at lower temperatures as also evidenced in the xp spectra shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density of states ( sdos ) are extracted by dividing the experimental spectra by the corresponding fermi - dirac distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> the sdos at room temperature [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(c ) ] exhibits a dip at @xmath7 ( pseudogap ) which leads to a soft gap at 260 k and a hard gap in the antiferromagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> it is to note here that the nel temperature , @xmath36 marks the onset of the first order phase transition in this compound , which involves nucleation and growth process . </S>",
    "<S> hence , pseudogap can be attributed to the signature of gapped low temperature phase nucleated above @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the band gap below @xmath36 can be attributed to the relocation of the brillouin zone boundary due to antiferromagnetic ordering in the @xmath12-plane . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the hard gap and vanishing of 0.3 ev features indicate that the @xmath14 electrons become more localized and shifts to higher binding energies in the magnetically ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> a plot of the sdos as a function of @xmath37 exhibit a linear dependence in both paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases indicating fermi - liquid like behavior of the localized electrons / quasiparticles .    </S>",
    "<S> all the above results establish that the low temperature phase is insulating due to finite energy gap at @xmath7 although @xmath3 is finite and large ( similar to that in the metallic phase of these compounds ) . since , other low energy excitations involving electron - phonon , electron - magnon etc . </S>",
    "<S> do not contribute in the linear term of specific heat , it is clear that some kind of glassy phase / amorphicity is present in this systems . </S>",
    "<S> the issue of phase separation and its implication in the colossal magnetoresistance in these systems are widely discussed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was also suggested that the magnetic transition is accompanied by the formation of a pseudogap phase @xcite similar to that observed in high temperature superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is tempting to correlate the behavior of this compound with the ones showing precursor effects , phase separations etc . </S>",
    "<S> these results emphasizes the need to consider a phase that has sufficient amorphicity and/or softness @xcite coexisting with antiferromagnetic insulating phase that may contribute as a linear term in the specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> this is not unrealistic as @xmath14 electrons are localized and hence , 20% la concentration at the sr sites in lasrmno@xmath2 will naturally induce disorder .    in summary , we have investigated the evolution of the electronic structure of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 with temperatures using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy to probe the origin of linear term in the specific heat in its insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> we observe interesting change in the oxygen 2@xmath23 bands contributing in the valence band spectra . </S>",
    "<S> spectral intensity is finite at the fermi level in the paramagnetic phase and the electronic states seems to have dominant local character ( peak of intensity appears around 0.3 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral functions close to the fermi level exhibit opening of a hard gap in the antiferromagnetic insulating phase via the formation of a soft coulomb gap at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the spectral function is fermi liquid like in all the phases . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate possibility of an amorphous phase involving localized quasiparticles within the long range ordered phase . </S>"
