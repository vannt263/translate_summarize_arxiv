    "[ @xcite ] and table 5.3 of [ @xcite ] ) . on the other hand , density functional theory ( dft)@xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations@xcite nowadays provide accurate numerical approximations of the correlation energy that definitely results to be small in comparison to eq .",

    "this conclusion only follows from the fact that dft@xcite and qmc analyses@xcite definitely showed that , at high dilution ( i.e. @xmath36 according to the most recent qmc analysis@xcite ) , the stable phase of the jellium model is the fully polarized bcc one .",

    "of course , this would correspond to exactly solve the problem .",
    "this being - if not impossible - very hard , one has to confine himself to look for a quantum crystalline state such that the expectation value of @xmath38 on it is smaller than that over state @xmath39 .",
    "actually , this has already been done in ref.[@xcite ] by solving the hf equations for a wigner crystal due to the fact that the hf equations coincide with equations obtained minimizing the expectation value of @xmath38 over a determinantal wave - function@xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall provide a different procedure that , based on rayleigh - ritz s principle and quantum field theory , allows us to determine a quantum crystalline state with an energy smaller than homogeneous hf s . to this aim , in section iia",

    "the resulting operators by @xmath42 , these obey the jordan - wigner algebra [ see eq.s ( [ 2.4 ] ) , ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) ] .",

    "s__trongly localized quantum crystalline states ( slqcs ) because they neglect the possibility that two or more electrons may momentarily be present in the same cell .",
    "then , the expectation value of the kinetic and potential operators are evaluated over the slqcs in terms of the electron density in sects . ii.b and ii.c for the unpolarized case and in sect.iii for the polarized one .",
    "the requirement that the resulting expectation value of @xmath17 be minimum determine the equations that determine @xmath44 . in sect .",
    "iv we show that these equations coincide with the hf ones with a different boundary condition and this implies that exchange and correlation contributions are equal to zero so that electron interactions are not fully accounted for . aiming to avoid , as far as possible , computer calculations we do not attempt to solve the mentioned equations . we simply consider a family of electron density functions , depending on a parameter @xmath46 , and numerically evaluate the expectation value of @xmath17 by the formulae derived in sects .",
    "ii and iii over a grid of @xmath46 values .",
    "then , for each @xmath22 value , we look for the @xmath46 value which makes the expectation value of @xmath17 minimum .",

    "in order to construct a quantum state that describes the electrons in a crystalline configuration we shall proceed as follows . at first we shall assume that the electrons are confined within a cubic box ( centered at the origin of a cartesian frame ) of edge @xmath47 and volume @xmath48 , and that the system is not polarized .",

    "this fact authomatically ensures their orthogonality and explains why eq.s  ( [ 4.9 ] ) and ( [ 4.10 ] ) involve a single function [ @xmath122 ] and a single eigenvalue [ @xmath231 ] .",
    "these considerations deserve a further remark .",
    "one would expect that @xmath97 contains a direct and an exchange term because @xmath93 is a completely antisymmetric state , but the fact that two different eigenfuntions have supports with a void intersection implies that slqcss by construction yield exchange and correlation contributions equal to zero .    to better understand the assumptions underlying the slqcs choice , we observe that a normalized quantum state relevant to @xmath0 particles confined to box @xmath1 can generally be written as @xmath242 where @xmath243 is a normalized and completely antisymmetric function .",
    "( for notational simplicity , we shall confine ourselves to the full polarized case till the end of this section . )",
    "the fundamental state is determined by the function @xmath244 , implicitly dependent on @xmath22 , that makes the expectation of @xmath17 over the resulting @xmath7 minimum . in its fundamental state ,",
    "the system , characterized by a translation invariant hamiltonian , will have a crystalline behaviour at a given @xmath22 value if @xmath244 is such that @xmath245 turns out to be a periodic function . in this case , state ( [ 4.10a ] ) with @xmath246 is the exact quantum crystalline fundamental state and the resulting energy will have a null correlation contribution .",
    "it is straightforward to check that states of form ( [ 3.7 ] ) correspond to the choice @xmath247 where the sum runs over all possible permutation of @xmath90 and @xmath248 is the parity of permutation @xmath249 .",
    "according to this relation , function @xmath250 is equal to zero if two or more of its variables fall within the same cell .",
    "consequently , by choosing a slqcs of form ( [ 3.7 ] ) one implicitly assumes that the pair correlation function @xmath251 , (  the probability density of finding two particles at two different points @xmath252 and @xmath253 ) is respectively equal to zero or @xmath254 depending on whether @xmath252 and @xmath253 lie in the same or in different cells .",
    "this behaviour is radically different from that obtained by ( [ 4.10a ] ) that neither factorizes nor , more importantly , vanishes if @xmath252 and @xmath253 lie in the same cell .",
    "for this reason , the slqcs approach fails in describing the `` fluctuations '' in the electron density .",
    "one expects that when these are important the slqcs results will not be accurate .",
    "however , in the limit of a very narrow @xmath44 , the slqcs aforesaid beahaviour is similar to that of an ideal classical crystal with a point - like particle within its unit cell so that the slqcs description can be realistic only within the @xmath22 region where the system is crystalline and @xmath255 turns out to be rather narrow .",
