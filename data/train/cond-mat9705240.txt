    "the collective modes of a bose condensed gas confined by an external potential have been the object of extensive work in the last months .",
    "the successful agreement between experimental results @xcite and theoretical predictions @xcite for the collective frequencies at low temperature has stimulated an intensive research activity .",
    "though only the modes with low multipolarity and frequency have been detected in experiments , the excitations at higher energy and angular momentum are also very important because they determine the statistical behavior of the system , including thermodynamics , transport phenomena and superfluid effects .",
    "the excited states at high energy are expected to have single - particle nature . however , the transition from collective ( phonon - like ) to single - particle excitations in a inhomogeneous system can differ significantly from the case of a uniform bose gas .",
    "in fact , the presence of a surface allows for the occurrence of single - particle states even at low energy ( lower than the chemical potential ) .",
    "these states , of low energy but high multipolarity , are localized near the surface , where the condensate density becomes small .",
    "this behavior represents a peculiar and interesting feature of these confined systems ; in a uniform bose gas , in fact , only phonons are present at low energy . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we have already pointed out the effects of these single - particle states on the thermodynamic properties of the trapped gases .    in the present work",
    "we solve the equations for the excited states of a weakly interacting gas in a spherical trap at zero temperature within bogoliubov theory .",
    "the main purpose is to investigate the collective ( phonon - like ) and single - particle character of the elementary excitations .",
    "this is accomplished by calculating key quantities , such as the density of states , the frequency of the surface modes and the quantum depletion of the condensate , and by comparing the predictions of bogoliubov theory with the ones of different approximations , like hartree - fock theory and the hydrodynamic model .",
    "finally we check the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation and we show that it provides simple and useful formulae for both the density of states and the quantum depletion of the condensate .",
    "the elementary excitations of a degenerate bose gas are associated with the fluctuations of the condensate . at low temperature",
    "they are described by the time dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the order parameter @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of atoms in the condensate . at zero temperature @xmath2",

    "the trap is included through @xmath9 , which is chosen here in the form of an isotropic harmonic potential : @xmath10 .",
    "the harmonic trap provides also a typical length scale for the system , @xmath11 . actually , the experimental traps have cylindrical symmetry , with different radial and axial frequencies , but the choice of a spherical trap , as we will discuss later , is not expected to affect the main conclusions of the present work , while reducing greatly the numerical effort .    the normal modes of the condensate can be found by linearizing the gp equations , i.e. , looking for solutions of the form @xmath12",

    "we use them to calculate the density of states , the frequency of the surface modes , the quantum depletion of the condensate , in order to clarify the different role played by excitations having collective and single - particle character .",
    "when the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 is large , the kinetic energy term in the ground state equation ( [ groundstate ] ) becomes negligible with respect to the mean field term and one gets the thomas - fermi approximation : @xmath22 with @xmath23 in the same limit the equations of motion ( [ coupled1]-[coupled2 ] ) coincide with the equations of the hydrodynamics ( hd ) of superfluids @xcite . in the spherical case their eigenfrequencies take the analytic form @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the angular momentum quantum number and the number of nodes in the radial solution , respectively .",
    "the deviations from the predictions of the noninteracting harmonic oscillator ( ho ) model , @xmath27 point out the effects of two - body interactions .",
    "these are particularly important for the so called  surface \" modes ( @xmath28 ) , where the ho prediction @xmath29 is significantly lowered to the hydrodynamic value @xmath30 . in general the hd prediction turns out to be very accurate for the low energy excitations of the system , while the ideal gas prediction is expected to be valid in the opposite case of high excitation energies .",
    "the exact solutions of the equations ( [ coupled1]-[coupled2 ] ) provide the correct interpolation between the two limiting regimes .    a typical spectrum obtained from equations ( [ coupled1]-[coupled2 ] )",
    "is given in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] for a gas of @xmath31 atoms of rubidium ( scattering length @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the bohr radius ) . for the spherical trap",

    "it corresponds to the oscillator length @xmath36 cm .",
    "energy is given in units @xmath37 and the chemical potential is @xmath38 in these units .",
    "the vertical bars have length @xmath39 , so that the angular momentum of each state can be inferred from the figure .",
    "one clearly sees that , at energy much larger than the chemical potential , the excited states tend to be grouped into levels @xmath37 apart , as in the noninteracting ho model .",
    "conversely , the energy of the lowest modes is close to the prediction of the hd equations @xcite .",
    "for instance , the lowest @xmath40 and @xmath41 modes differ by less than @xmath42% from the hydrodynamic values @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "once the spectrum of excited states is calculated , one can count the number of states below a given energy @xmath45 : @xmath46 the density of states , @xmath47 is simply the derivative @xmath48 .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath49 is well defined even for a discretized spectrum , while the density of states implies averaging the number of states within small but finite energy intervals .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] . for comparison the results of the noninteracting harmonic oscillator ( [ hospectrum ] ) and of the hydrodynamic model ( [ hdspectrum ] )",
    "are also shown .",
    "the effects of the repulsive interatomic forces are clearly responsible for an enhancement of the density of states with respect to the ideal gas .",
    "however @xmath49 remains well below the hd approximation , the latter being soon inadequate as @xmath45 increases .",
    "indeed hydrodynamic theory accounts for collective phenomena and provides an excellent description of the low - lying elementary excitations of the system @xcite , but completely ignores single - particle effects .",
    "this is exactly the opposite of what hartree - fock ( hf ) theory does .",
    "for this reason it is interesting to compare the results of bogoliubov theory with the predictions of hf theory in which one determines the eigenstates of the single - particle hamiltonian @xcite @xmath51 the lowest eigenstates of the hf hamiltonian are expected to be localized near the surface of the condensate . to understand better this point ,",
    "let us take the large @xmath2 limit . in this case one can use the thomas - fermi approximation ( [ tf ] ) for the ground state density .",
    "the hf hamiltonian then takes the simple form @xmath52 where @xmath53^{1/2}$ ] is the classical radius of the condensate .",
    "the hf potential has a pronounced minimum at @xmath54 .",
    "this potential well near the boundary persists in the hf hamiltonian even for smaller values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in general , hartree - fock theory is expected to be correct for energies larger than the chemical potential .",
    "for these trapped bosons , however , it accounts also for the low energy excitations close to the boundary , where the density of the condensate is small .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , where the hartree - fock and bogoliubov spectra are compared .",
    "one notes that the two spectra are rather similar even below the chemical potential ( @xmath55 in this case ) except for the excitations having lowest angular momenta , i.e. , shortest bars in the figure .",
    "those collective excitations are instead correctly reproduced by the hydrodynamic model . the corresponding hartree - fock prediction for the quantity @xmath49 is also given in fig .",
    "[ fig : n(e ) ] as a solid line .",
    "the agreement with the results of equations ( [ coupled1]-[coupled2 ] ) is remarkable in the whole range of energy .",
    "the figure shows the case of @xmath56 atoms but a similar agreement is found for all values of @xmath2 relevant for the experiments ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the above behavior represents a major difference with respect to the case of a homogeneous bose gas where phonons have a crucial effect on the density of states .",
    "in order to better understand the transition from the collective to the single particle regime , we have explored in details the evolution of the excitation energy for the surface modes ( @xmath28 ) as a function of their angular momentum @xmath25 , as predicted by the solution of the equations ( [ coupled1]-[coupled2 ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the effects of the interaction are particularly important for such modes and are responsible for a significant lowering of their frequency . in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegaell ] we plot the quantity @xmath58 , in units @xmath59 , for different numbers of atoms in the same trap .",
    "this ratio has an important physical meaning because , according to landau s criterium for superfluidity , it provides the rotational frequency at which the @xmath25-th surface excitation becomes unstable . the hydrodynamic prediction ( [ hdspectrum ] )",
    "is shown as a dashed line , the curve going asymptotically to zero for large @xmath25 .",
    "the figure shows that the bogoliubov states first follow the hd curve , but , rather soon , they deviate from it , approaching asymptotically the non interacting value @xmath60 .",

    "the wavelength of the excitations becomes shorter than @xmath65 and one explores microscopic details of the boundary which can not be described by the thomas - fermi approximation ( [ tf ] ) and by the hd equations .",
    "this yields @xmath66 , corresponding to an excitation energy @xmath67 , smaller than the chemical potential , which instead behaves as @xmath68 .",
