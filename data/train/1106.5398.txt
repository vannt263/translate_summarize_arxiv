    "for more than two decades , parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) is a central tool for the generation of entangled photons .",
    "this is a second order nonlinear process , where a photon from a pump beam splits into two photons , known as _ signal _ and _ idler _ , while conserving energy and momentum . the down - converted photons exhibit strong correlations in various degrees of freedom , such as wavelength , time of emission , polarization , momentum , and position @xcite .",
    "the down - conversion pair generation rate depends linearly on the pump beam power , and quadratically on the crystal thickness and on its nonlinear coefficients @xcite .",
    "since the first demonstration of an efficient pdc polarization entangled photon source @xcite , the most commonly used nonlinear birefringent crystal for this purpose is the uniaxial crystal @xmath0- ( bbo ) .",
    "the reasons for this are its relatively high nonlinear coefficients , high transparency , and the possibility for phase - matching over a broad spectral window @xcite .    in the last decade , many quantum optics experiments have used two consequent pdc events @xcite .",
    "others have used second order events of pdc @xcite .",
    "these events occur when two indistinguishable pump photons split into four , during the same coherence time ( or pulse duration for pulsed pump sources ) .",
    "both approaches require high efficiency of the pdc process as success probability is quadratic with the single pair generation probability .",
    "later , the third order pdc event as well as three consequent first order events have been used to create entangled states of six photons @xcite . recently",
    ", four consequent first order pdc events were used to demonstrate an eight photon entangled state @xcite .",
    "one possibility to enhance the pdc generation probability is to use thicker nonlinear crystals .",
    "the crystal length is limited by the non - collinearity of the process , that spatially separates the pump beam and the down - converted photons .",
    "in addition , there is the spatial walk - off effect between the two polarizations that degrades the entanglement quality ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : swo ] ) .",
    "thus , higher pump intensity is required .",
    "usually , the pump beam is generated by frequency doubling the radiation of a ti : sapphire laser in another nonlinear crystal @xcite .",
    "reported typical intensities are above 1w , but as the doubling crystal is damaged by the high power , it has to be translated continuously in order to maintain stable operation @xcite .",
    "additionally , the pump beam intensity can be enhanced inside a synchronized external cavity .",
    "such a setup has been shown to pump a bbo crystal with about 7w @xcite .",
    "in this work , we suggest and demonstrate the use of a novel crystal with higher nonlinear coefficients than bbo for the generation of polarization entangled photons .",
    "it is the monoclinic biaxial ( bibo ) crystal that has been introduced @xcite and characterized @xcite as a nonlinear optical crystal about a decade ago .",
    "since then , it was used in numerous frequency conversion experiments ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite , and refs . within ) .",
    "bibo was also used with type - i pdc for generating photon pairs with a pulsed laser source @xcite and for generating polarization entangled photons with a continuous pump source @xcite .",
    "it has a very broad transparency window and its nonlinear coefficients are considerably higher than those of bbo @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the biaxiallity introduces many differences and difficulties , compared to bbo .",

    "in order to lower reflections and to simplify the required calculations and alignment , it is desirable to cut the crystal facets perpendicular to the designed direction of the wave vector @xmath4 of the fundamental ( pump ) wave . the phase - matching calculation for the @xmath4 direction scans a quadrant of space , according to the monoclinic symmetry of bibo . in order to choose the optimal phase - matching direction ,",
    "the effective second order nonlinear coefficient @xmath3 is calculated for each @xmath4 direction . as an approximation for @xmath3 , we use the effective nonlinear coefficient of collinear second - harmonic generation , @xmath5 , calculated for any direction , even though the phase - matching condition is not fulfilled .",

    "the bbo crystal we used was 2 mm thick and anti - reflection coated , while the bibo was only 1.5 mm thick and uncoated .",
    "the thickness difference accounts for a factor of 1.78 , as the pdc efficiency depends quadratically on the crystal thickness @xcite .",
