    "one of the central problems in quantum information theory is the state discrimination problem .",
    "suppose that one is given a single quantum system , which is known to be in one of several possible states with a certain _ a priori _ probability .",
    "then one wishes to carry out such a measurement on the system that would yield as much information about the identity of the system s state as possible , where the gained information is defined in terms of the shannon mutual information .",
    "although there exist other figures of merit , which quantify distinguishability , such as the statistical overlap ( i.e. , the fidelity ) , or the kullback - leibler relative information @xcite , in this work we will focus on the mutual information , which quantifies the quality of measurement through the average gain of information about the unknown states @xcite .    a particular instance of the discrimination problem is when each possible state of the system is restricted to be in a product state . with regard to this ,",
    "some time ago peres and wootters @xcite addressed the intriguing problem of whether in order to gain as much information as possible from an ensemble of product states it is sufficient to do local measurements or sometimes necessary to carry out a global measurement on the system as a whole . technically , in the first case one is permitted to do any sequence of local operations carried out on each subsystem individually and classical communication between the subsystems ( locc ) , while in the second case arbitrary quantum operations are allowed on both spins .",
    "hitting upon a special ensemble of states , the double - trine states , they showed evidence that a global measurement was distinctly better than any locc measurement . recently , decker @xcite confirmed this result and other studies @xcite also proved conclusively the superiority of global measurements over locc measurements , for which property the phrase `` quantum nonlocality without entanglement '' was coined @xcite .    while",
    "in the above case , a distinction was made between the power of global and local measurements , one may further divide global measurements into the following two distinct classes : _ unentangled _ measurements , whose outcomes are associated with product states , and _ entangled _ measurements , for which at least one outcome is associated with an entangled state .",
    "an interesting question was posed recently by wootters @xcite of whether every ensemble of product states could be distinguished just as well by an unentangled measurement as by an entangled measurement .",
    "although it turned out @xcite , that an unentangled measurement on the double - trine ensemble was as good as an entangled measurement , the question remained open about the existence of other kinds of product states where the best unentangled measurement could be beaten by an entangled one .    in the present article",
    "we wish to address this general question by focusing on the following special state discrimination problem : given a source , which emits a pair of antiparallel spin-@xmath2 particles ( spins for short ) polarized along a random space direction , the observer s task is to perform an unentangled measurement on the two spins which provides the maximum gain of information about the polarization direction . in the present study we manage to bound from above the maximum gain of information attainable by an unentangled measurement on two antiparallel spins , and this upper bound",
    "will appear to be smaller than the information which can be extracted by a particular entangled measurement . with this result",
    "we intend to give an answer for the question raised above , that on product states entangled measurements are in general more informative than unentangled ones .",
    "further , since the set of unentangled measurements is strictly larger than the set of locc measurements @xcite , the pair of antiparallel spins can be considered as another example beside the double - trine ensemble , where global measurements are distinctly more powerful than locc measurements .",
    "note that the state discrimination of antiparallel spins discussed above can be interpreted as a quantum communication problem , i.e. , the problem of communicating an unknown spatial direction between two distant parties by the transmission of quantum particles .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite , but using the fidelity as a figure of merit .",
    "our findings corresponding to the mutual information thus can also be regarded as a complement to the results of the cited references .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the notation and formulate the problem . in sec .",
    "3 the rotational invariance property of the mutual information is demonstrated and the problem of obtaining the best unentangled measurement is presented as a constrained optimization problem . in sec .  4 the optimization is performed by the lagrange multipliers method by applying jensen s inequality . then the best unentangled measurement is given explicitly in terms of measurement projectors and we also discuss briefly the case of two parallel spins .",
    "the paper concludes in sec .  5 with a discussion of the results .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction our state discrimination problem can be presented as a quantum communication task : suppose alice wishes to communicate to bob a spatial direction , i.e. , a unit vector @xmath3 chosen completely at random . in order to accomplish the task ,",
    "alice prepares two spins in the product state @xmath4 where the first spin is polarized along the random space direction @xmath5 and the second spin is polarized in the opposite direction @xmath6 .",
    "then she sends the pair of antiparallel spins to bob , and upon receiving it bob performs an unentangled measurement on the spins so as to acquire as much knowledge about the spatial direction @xmath3 as possible .",
    "the polarized spin state @xmath7 corresponding to alice s signal satisfies @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the usual pauli matrices .",
    "on the other hand , the mathematical representation of bob s measurement apparatus is a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) consisting of a set of operators @xmath10 , which sum up to unity on the four - dimensional hilbert space of the two spins , @xmath11 where @xmath12 labels the outcome of the measuring process and we require @xmath13 owing to the size of the hilbert space .",
    "note that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ povm ] ) can be extended to the continuous case as well by a suitable adjustment of the notation .",
    "taking into account that one can always assume the projectors @xmath10 to have rank one @xcite , we can write @xmath14 where @xmath15 are positive weights and states @xmath16 are normalized .",
    "bob is allowed to carry out unentangled measurements , i.e. , measurements for which each of the povm operator elements @xmath10 is a tensor product .",
    "thus each state @xmath16 corresponding to measurement outcome @xmath17 can be written in the product form @xmath18 the pairs of unit vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are yet free parameters , which must be adjusted by bob appropriately so as to achieve the highest possible amount of mutual information between the outcomes of his unentangled measurement and alice s states . in order to arrive at an explicit formula for this information gain",
    "let us introduce some notations .",
    "the conditional probability @xmath21 that alice s preparation @xmath22 yields bob s result @xmath17 is given by born s rule @xmath23 which on substitution the signal state  ( [ signal ] ) and bob s product states  ( [ prodr ] ) into this expression gives @xmath24    let us designate an arbitrary point @xmath25 on the bloch sphere by the unit vector @xmath26 specified by the coordinates @xmath27 .",
    "since alice chooses @xmath3 randomly , or say equivalently , bob has no knowledge before his measurement about the space direction @xmath3 which alice indicates by her signal  ( [ signal ] ) , it entails the uniform _ a priori _",
    "distribution @xmath28 on the bloch sphere .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability that bob has measurement outcome @xmath17 is @xmath29 where the integration is performed over the whole bloch sphere and @xmath30 is the uniform measure on the bloch sphere .",
    "then applying bayes theorem the _ a posteriori _",
    "probability for @xmath3 is given by @xmath31    the shannon mutual information is the average amount of information that one gains about the direction @xmath3 upon observing the outcome of the measurement .",
    "thus it can be written as the difference of the _ a priori _",
    "entropy @xmath32 of @xmath33 and the average _ a posteriori _ entropy @xmath34 of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is infinite for the continuous distribution @xmath33 , but as it can be shown @xcite the divergent term is cancelled by terms from @xmath34 and the shannon mutual information can be expressed in the closed form @xcite @xmath36 in terms of the kullback - leibler relative information between the distributions @xmath35 and @xmath33 , @xmath37    our starting point is this information gain , eq .",
    "( [ mutual ] ) , to quantify bob s measuring strategy , which is well - defined for continuous distributions @xcite .",
    "particularly , we intend to optimize eq .",
    "( [ mutual ] ) by restricting bob to perform an unentangled measurement described by eq .",
    "( [ prodr ] ) and considering that the _ a priori _ distribution of alice s ensemble is @xmath28 .",
    "however , we also want the projectors @xmath10 to constitute a valid povm .",
    "this imposes the following pair of constraints , which bob s unentangled measurement operators must fulfill in order to optimize his gained information  ( [ mutual ] ) , @xmath38 where the first constraint is obtained by evaluating the trace of the povm condition  ( [ povm ] ) considering eq .",
    "( [ projector ] ) , and the second constraint is due to the fact that @xmath39 is a probability distribution .",
    "as a next step , we aim to exploit rotational invariance properties of the _ a priori _ probability @xmath39 defined by eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) and the mutual information @xmath40 given by eq .",
    "( [ mutual ] ) in order that we could bring the state  ( [ prodr ] ) to a simpler form .",
    "regarding the uniform distribution @xmath28 and substituting formula  ( [ prn ] ) into the definition  ( [ pr ] ) one obtains @xmath41 this formula , owing to the rotational invariance of the integral , is unchanged under an arbitrary collective rotation @xmath42 of the unit vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 for the same symmetry reasons the information gain  ( [ mutual ] ) ( with @xmath28 ) also remains invariant by replacing @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , let us choose the rotations @xmath42 in such a way that @xmath47 for r = 1 ,  , m. that is , by a suitable collective rotation of the pair of unit vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 , one rotates @xmath48 into the north pole , while @xmath44 to a point , represented by @xmath49 , so that it lies on the polar great circle arc of the bloch sphere . since @xmath42 represents an arbitrary rotation , the rotations  ( [ rotate ] )",
    "can always be performed , also guaranteeing @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angle between the pair of vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , in effect the mapping of states @xmath52 induced by the collective rotations @xmath42 will not change the amount of information gain  ( [ mutual ] ) . here",
    "@xmath53 can be written explicitly in the basis @xmath54 @xmath55 using relation  ( [ angle ] ) .",
    "let us make use of the informational equivalence which we found in the preceding subsection between @xmath16 and @xmath56 and make the replacement  ( [ map ] ) for obtaining a simplified form of the information gain  ( [ mutual ] ) . then by means of eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) and considering @xmath28 the conditional probability @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ prn ] ) is mapped to @xmath57 and in turn the probability @xmath39 becomes @xmath58 where in eq .",
    "( [ mapprn ] ) the variables @xmath59 are written out explicitly and were also used in the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ mappr ] ) .    given eqs .",
    "( [ mapprn]-[mappr ] ) the problem of optimizing bob s information gain  ( [ mutual ] ) subject to the corresponding constraints  ( [ constraints ] ) can be presented in terms of the variables @xmath60 .",
    "namely , after a bit of algebra and using @xmath28 the information gain  ( [ mutual ] ) quantified by the mutual information takes the explicit form @xmath61 where @xmath62 note that as a consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ mapprn ] ) and ( [ mappr ] ) the fraction @xmath63 and hence @xmath64 within eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) are independent of the index @xmath17 .    since the information gain  ( [ iav ] ) is subjected to constraints we have to impose some restrictions on the domain of the variables @xmath65 . on the one hand",
    ", these variables need to be in the range @xmath66 where the number @xmath67 is at least @xmath68 . on the other , the constraints  ( [ constraints ] )",
    "further restrict the domain and these conditions can be brought to the explicit forms @xmath69 by replacing eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ mappr ] ) . in the following ,",
    "let us refer to the domain , which is within the range  ( [ space ] ) and satisfies constraints  ( [ newconstraints ] ) as the feasible region .    to summarize this section , the information gain in eq .",
    "( [ iav ] ) with the constraints  ( [ space]-[newconstraints ] ) constitute the constrained optimization problem : bob s task is to maximize the mutual information ( defined by eq .",
    "( [ iav ] ) ) between his unentangled measurement outcomes and alice s signals by choosing appropriately the set of values @xmath70 from the feasible region ( defined by eqs .",
    "( [ space]-[newconstraints ] ) ) .",
    "the next section is centered on the problem of how to build a reasonable upper bound to this maximal amount of information gain .",
    "the direct evaluation of the integral in eq .  ( [ i ] ) is an intractable task owing to the logarithm appearing in the integrand ( a detailed analysis of the difficulties arising in an analytical treatment of the mutual information can be found in the phd thesis of fuchs @xcite ) .",
    "however , applying jensen s inequality @xcite it enables us to develop an upper bound to the function @xmath64 given by eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) and to its weighted sum , the information gain  ( [ iav ] ) .",
    "jensen s inequality involving a probability density function can be stated as follows @xcite : if @xmath71 is any real valued measurable function , @xmath72 is a probability density function , and @xmath73 is concave over the range of @xmath71 , then @xmath74 let the concave function @xmath73 be particularly the logarithm function @xmath75 , and let functions @xmath72 and @xmath71 be equal to the fraction @xmath76 . as a result a complete correspondence can be established between the integral within eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) and the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ jensen ] ) , entailing the upper bound @xmath77 to the function @xmath64 as follows : @xmath78 note that in contrast to the function @xmath64 , which can be computed only numerically , its upper bound @xmath77 can be given in analytic terms .",
    "the respective curves of the function @xmath64 and the function @xmath77 are plotted in fig .  1 in the range @xmath79 .     and its upper bound @xmath80 plotted against @xmath81 in the interval @xmath79 . ]    after developing an upper bound to the information function @xmath64 we wish to show that finding a global maximum of the function @xmath82 in the feasible region ( which region is defined in subsection  ( 3.2 ) ) will serve as an upper bound to the global maximum of the information gain  ( [ iav ] ) in the same feasible region , i.e. , to the amount of information which bob can acquire by his best unentangled measurement .    to supply a proof , let us suppose the opposite , that is inside the feasible region the maximum value of @xmath40 is bigger than the maximum value of @xmath83 .",
    "however , owing to the positive weights @xmath15 and the fact that @xmath84 , by the definitions  ( [ iav ] , [ jav ] ) @xmath85 at any point of the feasible region .",
    "thus , by means of this argument @xmath40 should also be upper bounded by @xmath83 at the very point of its maximum inside the feasible region , which contradicts our assumption , thereby completing the proof .      in this subsection , by the method of lagrange multipliers we find via an analytical treatment the value of the global maximum of @xmath83 in the feasible region so as to provide an upper bound to the highest value of @xmath40 in the feasible region ( as stated in the preceding subsection ) , achievable by an unentangled measurement .",
    "thus we will obtain an upper bound to the amount of information which bob can gain about alice s states by carrying out unentangled measurements .",
    "to this end , let us introduce the lagrange multipliers @xmath86 and @xmath87 which aim to account for the constraints  ( [ newconstraints ] ) .",
    "note that inequality constraints  ( [ space ] ) will instead be taken into account by restricting the domain of solutions .",
    "then our task is to maximize the lagrangian @xmath88 , @xmath89 variations of @xmath88 with respect to @xmath51 and @xmath15 yield the following two sets of equations , @xmath90 which can be solved for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and we obtain @xmath91 let us define the function @xmath92 then the first equality within eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) becomes @xmath93 .",
    "next our aim is to characterize @xmath94 according to its monotonicity .",
    "differentiating @xmath94 with respect to @xmath81 we obtain the explicit formula @xmath95 which is negative in the range @xmath96 ( and zero at @xmath97 ) implying that @xmath94 is a strictly decreasing function in the interval @xmath96 .",
    "further , according to eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , @xmath98 must be equal to a yet undetermined constant @xmath86 for @xmath12 at a stationary point ( which can be either a point of local extremum or a saddle point ) in the feasible region .",
    "thus the monotonicity of @xmath94 implies that at a stationary point in the feasible region all @xmath51 must be the same , that is one single solution exists for the variables @xmath51 , @xmath99    in order to determine unambiguously @xmath100 let us invoke constraints  ( [ newconstraints ] ) , which allow us to write at the above stationary point the following chain of equalities : @xmath101 hence the last equality provides us with the explicit solution @xmath102 in the interval @xmath103 $ ] , whereas the values of weights @xmath15 must satisfy the condition @xmath104 ( i.e. , they are in the feasible region ) .",
    "applying this solution  ( [ solution ] ) and the corresponding condition we may write at this stationary point for the value of @xmath83 , @xmath105    now we wish to prove that the value of @xmath106 is a global maximum of the function @xmath83 inside the feasible region .",
    "further , it is sufficient to show that it is a local maximum due to the single solution  ( [ solution ] ) .    for this aim let us fix the values of @xmath15 in the feasible region , and evaluate the hessian matrix of @xmath107 at the point of the solution  ( [ solution ] ) .",
    "after differentiations we obtain the hessian as an @xmath108 diagonal matrix whose @xmath109-th diagonal entry is given by @xmath110 .",
    "since the weights @xmath111 are positive , the hessian matrix is negative definite implying that the solution  ( [ solution ] ) is a point of local maximum in an unrestricted domain of @xmath51 and consequently it is in the ( smaller ) feasible region as well .",
    "this proves our proposition that @xmath112 bits is a global maximum , which can be attained by the function @xmath83 subject to the constraints  ( [ space]-[newconstraints ] ) . combining this result with",
    "the argument given in the previous subsection entails that the value @xmath0 bits necessarily upper bounds the information gain  ( [ iav ] ) attainable by an unentangled measurement on alice s two antiparallel spins .",
    "we found this upper bound by an analytical treatment , however by means of numerical calculations we may arrive as well at the maximum information gain @xmath113 attainable by an unentangled measurement if one replaces @xmath114 in eqs .",
    "( [ l]-[h ] ) . owing to the logarithm in the integrand  ( [ i ] )",
    "this really needs numerical integration .",
    "numerics shows that @xmath94 will be a monotonic decreasing function in this case as well , providing the same stationary point  ( [ solution ] ) in the feasible region for the information gain  @xmath40 as it was found before for its upper bound @xmath83 . in the present case ,",
    "however , we obtain @xmath115    by applying the same arguments for @xmath40 as for its upper bound @xmath83 and by evaluating the hessian matrix ( which can be done this time only numerically ) , we conclude that the solution  ( [ solution ] ) is a point of global maximum of @xmath40 in the feasible region ( as for @xmath83 ) , and therefore we can assert that the maximum mutual information between bob s unentangled measurement and alice s antiparallel spins is @xmath116 bits .    in the next subsection",
    "we discuss the concrete form of the povms which corresponds to the solution  ( [ solution ] ) , implying that the values @xmath116 bits and @xmath112 bits indeed correspond to a realizable measurement .",
    "our aim is to obtain those povm elements @xmath10 within eq .",
    "( [ povm ] ) which produce bob s best unentangled measurement . for this , we substitute the solution  ( [ solution ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ nr ] ) and as a result the mapped states @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) become @xmath118 i.e. , each of them turns out to be the same ( @xmath17 independent ) reference state @xmath119 .",
    "now , inverting the map  ( [ map ] ) and defining the unit vectors @xmath120 through the arbitrary spatial rotations @xmath121 yield @xmath122 let us try with a minimal measurement , i.e. , a measurement which has the minimum number @xmath123 of povm elements .",
    "this corresponds to a von neumann measurement satisfying the orthogonality requirement @xmath124 .",
    "consequently , @xmath125 implying @xmath126 ( in accord with conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ space]-[newconstraints ] ) for @xmath15 ) .",
    "now we are left with finding the angles @xmath127 defining directions @xmath128 , so as to completely define the povm elements .",
    "if we choose the angles @xmath127 to be @xmath129 it can be verified that the corresponding states @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ psir ] ) indeed constitue a legitimate povm , @xmath130 .",
    "the measuring strategy described by this unentangled povm is in fact an locc measurement : bob makes a von neumann measurement of alice s first spin along an arbitrary direction ( say @xmath131 ) and of alice s second spin along an orthogonal direction .    on the other hand , bagan et al .",
    "@xcite found that for a pair of antiparallel spins a measurement strategy which yields the maximal fidelity , at the same time attains the value @xmath1 bits of the mutual information .",
    "the corresponding povm measurement is a von neumann type , described by the projectors @xmath132 as follows @xcite , @xmath133 where the four unit vectors @xmath120 are pointing to the vertices of a tetrahedron inscribed in the unit sphere ( given explicitly by ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath134 denotes the singlet state .",
    "all four states in eq .",
    "( [ psirent ] ) are in fact entangled ; thus these states correspond to an entangled measurement .",
    "incidentally , they ought to be entangled owing to our analysis as well , providing to the best unentangled measurement the upper bound @xmath0 bits of mutual information ( which is smaller than @xmath1 bits ) .",
    "though it seems difficult to prove analytically that the value @xmath1 bits is the accessible information corresponding to the most informative measurement on alice s signal state , we carried out extensive numerical calculations which support this conjecture .",
    "nevertheless , the value @xmath1 bits definitely lower bounds the mutual information attainable by an entangled measurement , and the value @xmath0 bits obtained in the preceding subsection upper bounds the mutual information attainable by an unentangled measurement .",
    "therefore , the nonzero gap between the two bounds provides us with the proof that in general optimal state discrimination can not be achieved by an unentangled measurement , if the performance of the state discrimination is quantified by the mutual information .",
    "we may directly obtain results from our previous analysis for the case when alice uses two parallel spins to encode information .",
    "actually , one needs to flip the second spin @xmath135 into @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ mapprn ] ) which affects eq .",
    "( [ mappr ] ) as well , and then substitute these modified formulas into the information gain  ( [ iav ] ) . however , the flip of the second spin is equivalent in effect to flip the direction @xmath136 in eq .",
    "( [ mapprn ] ) . especially , symmetry requires that the one - to - one correspondence between the case of parallel and antiparallel spins is given by the change of variables @xmath137 in the formula for the information gain  ( [ iav ] ) .",
    "taking into account the above mapping the solution  ( [ solution ] ) for antiparallel spins also holds true for parallel spins .",
    "thus the best unentangled measurement on parallel spins ( such as on antiparallel spins ) is locc type , associated with states  ( [ psir ] ) , providing the same mutual information @xmath116 bits as in section  ( 4.2 ) for two antiparallel spins .",
    "actually , this result can be seen from the outset if we recall that in the case of locc protocols there is no difference between performing measurements on parallel and antiparallel spins @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the optimal measurement of parallel spins due to tarrach and vidal @xcite is the one which is defined by the entangled states @xmath138 where @xmath120 are pointing to the four corners of the tetrahedron , as in the antiparallel situation , given by ref .",
    "the information gain of this optimal measurement is @xmath139 bits as given by ref .",
    "thus in the parallel case as well the best measuring strategy of bob proves to be an entangled measurement .",
    "in summary , an analytical proof was presented that the accessible information obtainable by an optimal measurement about a random space direction @xmath3 encoded in a pair of antiparallel spins can not be attained by an unentangled measurement .",
    "the information gain has been quantified by the shannon mutual information between the signal states and the measurement outcomes , and by an unentangled measurement we mean that each povm operator is a tensor product .",
    "we used a particular form of the mutual information , well - defined for a continuous distribution of the signal states , and exploited its rotational invariance .",
    "then jensen s inequality enabled us to upper bound the mutual information attainable by an unentangled measurement .",
    "this upper bound has been found by the lagrange multipliers method .",
    "explicitly , we obtained the upper bound @xmath0 bits of information for the best unentangled measurement while the lower bound @xmath1 bits of information corresponds to the best entangled measurement .",
    "we also made numerical calculations , which revealed that the maximum mutual information which can be attained by an unentangled measurement is @xmath140 bits both for the cases of antiparallel and parallel spins , and in turn both correspond to the same von neumann type measurement apparatus .",
    "this entails that interestingly for the case of antiparallel spins the optimal measurement is about one and one - half times more effective than an unentangled measurement , and for the case of parallel spins it is still more effective but to a lesser degree , provided that the measure of success is given in terms of the mutual information .",
    "let us make a comparison between the case of antiparallel spins analyzed in this article , and the double - trine states of refs .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) from the state distinguishability point of view . while on the double - trine ensemble the best unentangled measurement was actually a global measurement , for the antiparallel ( and also for the parallel )",
    "spins the best unentangled measurement was in turn an locc measurement ( especially individual von neumann type ) .",
    "this fact may partially explain the large difference obtained in the power of unentangled and entangled measurements on antiparallel spins , and also would raise the possibility of finding a state ensemble , where the power of unentangled measurement lies between the power of entangled and the power of locc measurements .",
