    "while the original kepler mission was in operation , it continually monitored over 150,000 stars in a region of sky containing parts of the cygnus and lyre constellations . with unprecedented photometric precision",
    ", a great amount of work has been done to categorize , model , and determine the nature of the many new variables discovered ( for an overview of mission characteristics and objectives , see borucki ( 2008 ) ; for an overview of the kepler asteroseismology group , see gilliland ( 2010 ) .",
    "two categories which have had several members added as a result of the mission are eclipsing binaries and intrinsic pulsating variables .",
    "however , as with any rapid increase of such categories , the potential for initial misclassification of a system is possible .",
    "both targets are listed in the kebc ( 10684673 with a period of 0.1925563 days and 12216817 with a period of 0.2462731 days ; kirk et al .",
    "2016 ) , however both are flagged as uncertain in nature .",
    "the light curves of both targets are shown in figure 1 .",
    "while both light curves show variability , they do not share characteristics of classical eclipsing binaries , such as algol type systems .",
    "for example , there are no obvious eclipse features .",
    "rather , the structures in the light curve seem to be a superposition of several sinusoidal signals . as will be shown below",
    ", the frequencies and amplitudes of all the dominant frequencies in each target are consistent with  scuti - type pulsations .",
    "one specific class of eclipsing binaries , w uma eclipsing binaries , have the same depth for both the primary and secondary eclipse , and can therefore produce , under the right circumstances , a sinusoidal signal . with the presence of the additional signals , there are two logical possibilities .",
    "either the targets could be w uma systems , in which one of the components is also pulsating , or the light curve can be interpreted as a classic single @xmath0 scuti pulsating in multiple modes .",
    "+ w uma eclipsing binaries are characterized by near equal minima , variability as low as a few tenths of a magnitude , and short periods of about 0.25 to about 1.0 days .",
    "because the periods are short , most w uma variables are assumed to be near contact or overcontact binaries .",
    "w uma systems can range from a through k spectral types .",
    "see binnendijk ( 1970 ) and li et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for an overview of w uma systems .",
    "in this study , we use exclusively the one short - cadence ( sc ) data set obtained by the kepler space telescope and retrieved from the mast archive(aura 2015 ) .",
    "sc data sets are approximately one month in duration ( rather than a full three - month quarter ) yet with the shortened image collection and integration times , data sets regularly have more than 40,000 data points ( as opposed to  7,000 data points for each long cadence data set ) . because the sc data sets have such short time intervals , they are the most useful for studying @xmath0 scuti - type variability .",
    "both targets have one sc data set publicly available .",
    "kepler began sc data collection for kic 10684673 at 12:15:49 on 2009 - 05 - 13 and ended at 11:47:11 2009 - 06 - 15 ( taken during quarter 1 of observations ) .",
    "the start and end collection times for kic 12216817 are 20:38:32 2009 - 08 - 20 and 23:23:42 2009 - 09 - 23 , respectively ( taken during quarter 2 of the observational cycle ) . the data set for kic 10684673 had a total of 49,030 usable datapoints , while kic 12216817 had a total of 38271 , each after the removal of the outliers .",
    "sample pdcsap flux light curves ( after the removal of the null data points when the telescope was offline ) are shown in figure 1 . as can be seen from figure 1 , no obvious eclipse features are prominent in the light curves of either target .",
    "the kebc gives an orbital period of 0.1925563 days for kic 10684673 , and an orbital period of 0.2462731 days for kic 1226817 .",
    "both targets , while in the catalog , carry an unc flag for uncertain whether the object is an eclipsing binary . +",
    "to prepare the data for analysis , the first step taken involved removing any obvious outlier data points . secondly , the fluxes were converted to a magnitude scale via the equation@xmath1 where m is the magnitude , and f is the flux of each individual pdcsap measurement . for convenience ,",
    "the conventional minus sign was omitted , as we are only interested in @xmath2 m ; the minus sign is unnecessary and this equation preserves the orientation of the data as presented in figure 1 . once converted to the magnitude scale ,",
    "the data were frequency - searched using the period04 software package ( lenz and breger 2005 ) between the values of 3 c / d and 50 c / d , the typical range of frequencies for @xmath0 scuti variables .",
    "the power spectra for both targets are shown in figure 2 in terms of the amplitude in magnitudes .",
    "as can be seen , both targets have several signals in their respective power spectra . to model the data , only frequencies with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath3 5",
    "were used to save on computational time .",
    "table 1 gives the values of the frequencies used for the modeling and their associated uncertainties .",
    "+        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to model the data , we performed a fitting routine in period04 using the frequencies of table 1 . from the fit ,",
    "the amplitudes and phases were determined ( along with their uncertainties ) .",
    "these parameters were then taken as the initial estimates for our model which was then inserted into a reduced @xmath4 calculation , as outlined in bevington and robinson ( 2003 ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath4 can be written as @xmath5 where n is the number of data points , y@xmath6 represents the observed magnitudes associated with each observation time , @xmath7 represents the uncertainty associated with the measurements , and y(t@xmath6 ) represents the value of the model at each observation time .",
    "each pdcsap flux measurement comes with an associated uncertainty , which must be converted to the uncertainties on the magnitudes . to convert the uncertainties from fluxes to magnitudes , we use the usual procedure @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the uncertainties on the magnitudes and fluxes , respectively .",
    "the model y(t@xmath6 ) in the reduced @xmath4 calculation are given by@xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the amplitude , angular frequency , and phase of each sine wave given and @xmath15 is the total number of frequencies for each object used in the study ( coincidentally @xmath15 = 5 in both cases ) .",
    "it should be noted that in the case of kic 10684673 , there is a definite systematic and positive trend in the data . the entire data set was fit with a linear function to determine the slope and intercept of the trend .",
    "finally , it is customary to define the reduced @xmath4 function as the original @xmath4 function divided by the difference between the number of data points and the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "however , because the number of data points for both target are @xmath16 40,000 , and the number of parameters ( p ) being fit for both targets are p < 10 , the difference becomes @xmath17 .",
    "+ the model was refined by running a nonlinear least - squares fit using a marquardt - levenburg algorithm .",
    "the routine allowed the amplitudes and phases to vary while holding the frequencies of table 1 fixed until the set of amplitudes and phases which minimized the reduced @xmath4 were found . in the case of kic 10684673 , the linear trend was also incorporated into the routine .",
    "the values of the parameters ( and associated uncertainties ) obtained from the fitting procedure are given in table 2 , as is the overall value for the reduced @xmath4 calculation .",
    "the results of the fitting for both targets are shown in figure 3 .",
    "this shows representative samples of the fit over the entire sc data set for both targets in order to show the quality of the fit with the data .",
    "+ ideally , the expectation value of the reduced @xmath4 for a very good fit would be very close to one ( bevington and robinson , 2003 ) . as can be seen from table 2 , our values are somewhat high .",
    "however , this can be explained by the extreme smallness of the photometric uncertainties associated with each measurement .",
    "they are typically about 3 or more orders of magnitude smaller than the measurements . this being the case , even though our reduced @xmath4 values seem a little high for typical photometric measurements , kepler s precision is very much atypical",
    ". therefore we conclude , given how well the data is replicated by the model , that the fit is satisfactory , especially since the model replicates every major feature throughout the entire data set .",
    "it is also at this point that we can feel confident , given the quality of the models , that the frequencies reported in table 1 are genuine signals and not spurious .",
    "in this study we have demonstrated that the sc light curves of kic 10684673 and kic 12216817 can both be modeled as single @xmath0 scuti - type pulsating systems pulsating in several modes . both",
    "are included in the kebc , however both are flagged as uncertain in nature . while our analysis does not completely rule out the possibility of either of these systems being eclipsing binaries , this study gives strong support for the hypothesis that all of the variation in each case can be explained by a single , pulsating object . to completely determine the nature of the system",
