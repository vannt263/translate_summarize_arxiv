    "schemes with sterile neutrinos have attracted a lot of attention since the lsnd group announced the anomaly@xcite which would imply mass squared difference of @xmath4(1 ) ev@xmath1 if it is interpreted as a phenomenon due to neutrino oscillation . the standard three flavor scheme has only two independent mass squared differences , i.e. , @xmath5ev@xmath1 for the solar neutrino oscillation , and @xmath6ev@xmath1 for the atmospheric neutrino oscillation . to accommodate a neutrino oscillation scheme to the lsnd anomaly ,",
    "therefore , the extra state should be introduced .",
    "this extra state should be sterile neutrino , which is singlet with respect to the gauge group of the standard model , because the number of weakly interacting light neutrinos should be three from the lep data@xcite .",
    "recently sterile neutrino scenarios are becoming popular again because of a few reasons .",
    "one is the data of the miniboone experiment which been performed to test the lsnd anomaly .",
    "although their data on the neutrino mode@xcite disfavors the region suggested by lsnd , their data on the anti - neutrino mode@xcite seems to be consistent with that of lsnd .",
    "the second one is the so - called reactor anomaly .",
    "the flux of the reactor neutrino was recalculated in ref.@xcite recently and it was claimed that the normalization is shifted by about + 3% on average .",
    "this claimed is qualitatively consistent with an independent calculation in ref.@xcite .",
    "if their claim on the reactor neutrino flux is correct , then neutrino oscillation with @xmath71ev@xmath1 may be concluded from a re - analysis of 19 reactor neutrino results at short baselines@xcite .",
    "the third one is the so - called gallium anomaly .",
    "the data of the gallium solar neutrino calibration experiments indicates deficit of @xmath8 and it may imply neutrino oscillation@xcite .",
    "it has been known that reactor experiments with more than one detector has a possibility to measure @xmath9 precisely because some of the systematic errors can be canceled by the near - far detector complex@xcite .",
    "three experiments@xcite are now either running or expected to start soon to measure @xmath9 . in the standard three flavor case with @xmath10ev@xmath1 ,",
    "it was shown assuming infinite statistics that the optimized baseline lengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the far and near detectors are @xmath131.8 km and @xmath140 km in the rate analysis@xcite , while they are @xmath1310.6 km and @xmath148.4 km in the spectrum analysis@xcite . to justify the assumption on negligible statistical errors for @xmath1510 km , unfortunately , one would need unrealistically huge detectors , so one is forced to choose the baseline lengths which are optimized for the rate analysis for @xmath16ev@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one performs an oscillation experiment to probe @xmath17(1 ) ev@xmath1 , it becomes realistic to place the detectors at the baseline lengths which are optimized for the spectrum analysis  ( see sect . 4 in the published version of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in this talk i would like to discuss the sensitivity of very short line reactor experiments to the sterile neutrino mixing for @xmath17(1 ) ev@xmath1 in the so - called ( 3 + 1)-scheme@xcite .",
    "proposals have been made to test the bound of the bugey reactor experiment@xcite on the sterile neutrino mixing angle using a reactor@xcite , an accelerator@xcite , and a @xmath18-source@xcite .",
    "four - neutrino schemes consist of one extra sterile state and the three weakly interacting ones .",
    "the schemes are called ( 3 + 1)- and ( 2 + 2)-schemes , depending on whether one or two mass eigenstate(s ) are separated from the others by the largest mass - squared difference @xmath19(1 ) ev@xmath1 .",
    "the ( 2 + 2 ) scheme is excluded by the solar and atmospheric neutrino data@xcite , so i will not discuss the ( 2 + 2 ) schemes here . in the ( 3 + 1 ) scheme ,",
    "the phenomenology of solar and atmospheric oscillations is approximately the same as that of the three flavor framework , so there is no tension between the solar and atmospheric constraints .",
    "however , the ( 3 + 1 ) scheme has a problem in accounting for lsnd and all other negative results of the short baseline experiments . to explain the lsnd data while satisfying the constraints from other disappearance experiments , the oscillation probabilities of the appearance and disappearance channels should satisfy the following relation @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the value of the effective two - flavor mixing angle as a function of the mass squared difference @xmath24 in the allowed region for lsnd ( @xmath25 ) , the cdhsw experiment @xcite ( @xmath26 ) , and the bugey experiment @xcite ( @xmath27 ) , respectively .",
    "the reason that the ( 3 + 1)-scheme to explain lsnd has been disfavored is because eq .",
    "( [ relation31 ] ) is not satisfied for any value of @xmath24 , if one adopts the allowed regions in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the flux of the reactor neutrino is slightly larger than the one used in the bugey analysis@xcite , however , the allowed region becomes slightly wider and one has more chance to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ relation31 ] ) .",
    "i will use the following parametrization for the mixing matrix@xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the complex rotation matrices in the @xmath30-plane defined as @xmath31_{pq } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\delta_{pq}+(\\cos \\theta_{jk}-1 ) ( \\delta_{jp}\\delta_{jq}+\\delta_{kp}\\delta_{kq } ) + \\sin \\theta_{jk } ( e^{-i\\delta_l}\\delta_{jp}\\delta_{kq } -e^{i\\delta_l}\\delta_{jq}\\delta_{kp } ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this parametrization , for the very short baseline reactor experiments , where the average neutrino energy @xmath32 is approximately 4mev and the baseline length is about 10 m , i have @xmath33 , so that the disappearance probability is given by @xmath34 to a good approximation . so the analysis of the ( 3 + 1)-scheme is reduced to that of a two flavor framework with the oscillation parameters ( @xmath35 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "throughout my talk i discuss the case with a single reactor and two detectors .",
    "i assume here that the near and far detectors are identical and they have the same sizes of systematic errors .",
    "the conditions of the detectors are assumed to be the same as those of the bugey experiment , i.e. , liquid scintillation detector of volume 600 liters with the detection efficiency which yields about 90,000 events at @xmath37=15 m from a reactor of a power 2.8gw after running for 1800 hours .    to evaluate the sensitivity to @xmath36 ,",
    "let us introduce the following @xmath38 which was adopted in ref.@xcite  ( see ref.@xcite for details ) : @xmath39 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\displaystyle\\sum_{a = n , f}\\left[\\left ( \\frac{\\alpha^a } { \\sigma_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm db}}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm cal}}^a } { \\sigma_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm cal}}}\\right)^2\\right ] + \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left ( \\frac{\\alpha_i } { \\sigma_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm db}}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha } { \\sigma_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm db}}}\\right)^2\\bigg\\}. \\label{chipull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath38 stands for a quantity which expresses how much deviation we have between the numbers of events with and without oscillations , compared with the experimental errors . in eq.([chipull ] ) , @xmath40 is the number of events to be measured at the near ( @xmath41 ) and far ( @xmath42 ) for the @xmath43-th energy bin with the neutrino oscillation , and @xmath44 is the theoretical prediction without the oscillation .",
    "@xmath45 is the uncorrelated error which consists of the statistical plus uncorrelated bin - to - bin systematic error : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the uncorrelated bin - to - bin systematic error .",
    "@xmath48 is a variable which introduces the detector - specific uncertainties @xmath49 of the near and far detectors .",
    "@xmath50 is a variable for an uncertainty @xmath51 of the theoretical prediction for each energy bin which is uncorrelated between different energy bins .",
    "stands for the property for the systematic error with respect to the detectors while the second is with respect to bins , and capital ( small ) letter stands for a correlated ( uncorrelated ) systematic error . ]",
    "@xmath52 is a variable which introduces an energy calibration uncertainty @xmath53 and comes in the theoretical prediction in the form of @xmath54 instead of the observed energy @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath55 is the deviation divided by the expected number of events from the theoretical prediction @xmath44 due to the energy calibration uncertainty . here",
    "i take the following reference values for the systematic errors : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "first of all , i will consider a commercial reactor whose thermal power is 2.8gw and i will assume that the dimension of its core is 4 m in diameter and 4 m in height .",
    "@xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ chipull ] ) is computed numerically in the case of @xmath61ev@xmath1 as a function of the baseline lengths @xmath12 and @xmath11 of the two detectors , and the baseline lengths @xmath12 and @xmath11 are varied to optimize the sensitivity to @xmath2 .",
    "it is found that the set @xmath62 ( 17 m , 23 m ) gives the optimum .",
    "in contrast to the rate analysis , in which the optimized baseline length of the near detector is @xmath12=0 m to avoid oscillations , the spectrum analysis with @xmath63 ( 17 m , 23 m ) looks at the difference between the maximum and minimum of the spectrum shape with neutrino oscillations at @xmath12 and @xmath11 mainly for the energy region @xmath64 4mev where the number of events are expected to be the largest ( see the upper panel in fig.[fig1 ] ) . unlike the case of infinite statistics@xcite , the statistical errors are important in the present setup of the detectors , and longer baseline lengths are disfavored .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath36 in the case of the baseline lengths @xmath63 ( 17 m , 23 m ) is shown in fig.[fig2 ] as a function of @xmath35 ( the line referred to as `` commercial '' ) .",
    "the region suggested by combination of the reactor and gallium anomalies and the miniboone data is also given in fig.[fig2 ] for comparison . for @xmath65ev@xmath1 ,",
    "the sensitivity is no better than 0.1 , which is basically the result of the rate analysis .",
    "the sensitivity in the case of a hypothetical point - like reactor , where all the conditions for the detectors are the same , is also given in fig.[fig2 ] for comparison ( the line referred to as `` point - like '' ) .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] indicates that the sensitivity would be as good as several @xmath66 for a few ev@xmath1 , if the core were point - like .",
    "so we can conclude that we have poor sensitivity for @xmath67 2ev@xmath1 because of the smearing effect of the finite core size of the reactor .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have seen that the sensitivity to @xmath36 is lost because of the smearing effect of finite core size .",
    "next , i would like to discuss three research reactors , joyo@xcite with mk - iii upgrade@xcite , the ill research reactor@xcite , and the osiris research reactor@xcite .",
    "they all have a relatively small size and a relatively large thermal power .",
    "joyo is an experimental fast breeder reactor and the dimension of its core is 0.8 m in diameter and 0.5 m in height , and its thermal power is 140mw .",
    "the ill ( osiris ) research reactor is a thermal neutron reactor with high enrichment uranium @xmath68u , and the dimension of its core is 0.4 m in diameter and 0.8 m in height ( 0.57m@xmath690.57m@xmath690.6 m ) and its thermal power is 58mw ( 70mw ) , respectively .",
    "again @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ chipull ] ) is computed numerically in each case , and it is optimized with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "the optimum set of the baseline lengths turns out to be @xmath62 ( 4 m , 8 m ) for @xmath61ev@xmath1 for all the three cases .",
    "the lower panel in fig.[fig1 ] shows the spectrum distortion in the case of @xmath37=4 m , 8 m .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath36 is shown in fig.[fig2 ] as a function of @xmath35 in the case of the sets of the baseline lengths @xmath63 ( 4 m , 8 m ) for the three cases and @xmath63 ( 3 m , 4 m ) for joyo . from fig.[fig2 ] it is clear that the sensitivity of an experiment with a small core reactor is better that that with a commercial reactor for 2ev@xmath1@xmath70ev@xmath1 .",
    "in the framework of the ( 3 + 1)-scheme , the sensitivity to @xmath2 of very short baseline reactor oscillation experiments was studied by a spectrum analysis .",
    "the assumptions are that one has two detectors whose size and efficiency are exactly the same as those used at the bugey experiment and @xmath38 is optimized with respect to the positions of the two detectors .    in the case of a commercial reactor , by putting the detectors at @xmath71 17 m and @xmath72 23 m , one obtains the sensitivity as good as several @xmath66 for @xmath73ev@xmath1 , but the sensitivity is lost above 1ev@xmath1 due to the smearing of the finite core size .    in the case of a research reactor with a small core ( such as joyo , ill , osiris ) ,",
    "on the other hand , one obtains the sensitivity as good as a several @xmath66 for 1ev@xmath1@xmath74ev@xmath1 if the detectors are located at @xmath71 4 m and @xmath72 8 m .    in all the cases discussed above with the bugey - like detector setup , the statistical errors are dominant .",
    "the reason that the case of the research reactors ( joyo , ill , osiris ) is competitive despite its small power is because the total numbers of events at @xmath15 several meters are comparable to those of the case with a commercial reactor at @xmath15 a few @xmath69 10 meters",
    ".    to turn this idea into reality , there are two experimental challenges .",
    "one is to put detectors at a location very near to a research reactor .",
    "the other one is to avoid potentially huge backgrounds from the reactor .",
    "nevertheless , since the best fit point ( @xmath35 , @xmath2 ) @xmath75 ( 2ev@xmath1 , 0.1 ) obtained in ref.@xcite lies within the excluded region in fig.[fig2 ] , the experiment at these research reactors offers a promising possibility .",

    "he would also like to thank f.  suekane and g.  mention for useful correspondence and k.  schreckenbach for discussions on research reactors .",
