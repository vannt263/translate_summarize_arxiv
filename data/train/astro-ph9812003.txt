    "conservation of angular momentum directs the accreted material to form a disk around the central   and the properties of such an accretion disk may be calculated under a few basic assumptions ( e.g. sakura and sunyaev , 1973 ) . in particular one can calculate the luminosity and spectral distribution of the radiation from the accretion disk , given the   mass and the .    as the   mass grows due to the accreted material , the luminosity and the emerging spectrum change with time .",
    "since the continuum radiation ionizes the line - emitting material and drives the broad agn s , the change in the properties of the radiation from the central source changes also the properties of the emission lines .",
    "in particular the spectral shape of the ionizing radiation would determine the ( the ratio between the energy flux in the line to the continuum energy flux at the line frequency ) of the s.    baldwin ( 1977 ) showed that the of the civ   decreases with increasing continuum luminosity , a correlation known as the baldwin effect. a similar relation has been found also for other broad s. the origin of this effect is not understood .",
