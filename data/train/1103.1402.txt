    "the current decade has witnessed a significant amount of effort towards discovering the networks of protein - protein interactions ( interactomes ) in a number of model organisms .",
    "these efforts resulted in hundreds of thousands of individual interactions between pairs of proteins being reported  @xcite .",
    "repositories such as the biogrid  @xcite , intact  @xcite , mint  @xcite , dip  @xcite , bind  @xcite and hprd  @xcite have been established to store and distribute sets of interactions collected from high - throughput scans as well as from curation of individual publications .",
    "depending on its goals , each interaction database , maintained by a different team of curators located around the world includes and annotates interactions differently .",
    "consequently , while many interactions of specific interactomes are shared among databases  @xcite , no one contains the complete known interactome for any model organism . constructing a full - coverage protein - protein interaction network",
    "therefore requires retrieving and combining entries from many databases .",
    "this task is facilitated by several initiatives developed by the proteomics community over the years .",
    "the imex consortium  @xcite was formed to facilitate interchange of information between different primary databases by using a standardized format .",
    "the proteomics standards initiative molecular interaction ( psi - mi ) format  @xcite allows a standard way to represent protein interaction information .",
    "one of its salient features is the controlled vocabulary of terms that can be used to describe various facets of a protein - protein interaction including source database , interaction detection method , cellular and experimental roles of interacting proteins and others .",
    "the psi - mi vocabulary is organized as an ontology , a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) , where nodes correspond to terms and links to relations between terms .",
    "this enables the terms to be related in an efficient and algorithm - friendly manner .",
    "consistently annotated datasets are useful for development and assessment of interaction prediction tools  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such datasets also form the basis of interaction networks , for which numerous analysis tools have been developed  @xcite . depending on biological aims of a tool ,",
    "different entities ( nodes ) and potentially weighted interactions ( edges ) may be preferred .",
    "the chance of conflicting predictions from different tools can be reduced by starting from a consistently annotated dataset that faithfully represents all available evidences . to maintain a coherent development of biological understanding ,",
    "it is indispensable to keep the reference datasets up - to - date .",
    "we examined several primary interaction databases with the aim of constructing non - redundant , consistently annotated and up - to - date reference datasets of physical interactions for several model organisms .",
    "unfortunately , the common standard format used by most primary databases still does not allow direct compilation of full non - redundant interactomes .",
    "this mainly results from the fact that different primary databases may use different identifiers for interacting proteins and different conventions for representing and annotating each interaction . combining interaction data from bind  @xcite , biogrid  @xcite , corum  @xcite , dip  @xcite , hprd  @xcite , intact  @xcite , mint  @xcite , mpact  @xcite , mppi  @xcite and ophid  @xcite , the irefindex  @xcite database represents a significant advance towards a complete and consistent set of all publicly available protein interactions .",
    "apart from being comprehensive and relatively up - to - date , the main contribution of irefindex is in addressing the problem of protein identifiers by mapping the sequence of every interactant into a unique identifier that can be used to compare interactants from different source databases . in a further ` canonicalization ' procedure  @xcite , different isoforms of the same protein",
    "are mapped to the same canonical identifier . by adhering to the psi - mi vocabulary and file format",
    ", irefindex provides largely standardized annotations for interactants and interactions .",
    "construction of irefindex led to the development of irefweb , a web interface for interactive access to irefindex data  @xcite .",
    "irefweb allows an easy visualization of evidence for interactions associated with user - selected proteins or publications .",
    "recently , the authors of irefindex and irefweb published a detailed analysis of agreement between curated interactions within irefindex that are shared between major databases  @xcite .",
    "however , aiming to maintain all information from original sources , irefindex consequently , there will be features one desires to have that may not fit well within the scope of irefindex .",
    "for example , one may wish to treat interactions arising from enzymatic reactions as directed and to be able to selectively include / exclude certain types of reactions such as acetylation .",
    "in many cases , the information about post - translational modifications is available directly from source databases , but is not integrated into irefindex .",
    "another issue that propagates into irefindex from source databases has to do with protein complexes .",
    "some databases represent experimentally observed complexes as interactions with more than two participants , while others expand them into binary interactions using spoke or matrix model  @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently observed that this different representation of complexes is responsible for a significant number of disagreements between major databases curating the same publication . from our earlier work",
    "@xcite , we found that such expanded complexes may lead to nodes with very high degree and often introduce undesirable shortcuts in networks . to fairly treat the information provided by protein complexes without exaggeration , it is preferable to replace the expanded interactions , either from spoke or matrix models , with a flat list of complex members",
    ". additionally , we discovered that the mapping of each protein to a canonical group by irefindex would sometimes place protein sequences clearly originating from the same gene ( for example differing in one or two amino acids ) into different canonical groups .    to achieve the goal of constructing non - redundant , consistently annotated and up - to - date reference datasets , we developed a script , called ppitrim , that processes irefindex and produces a consolidated dataset of physical protein - protein interactions within a single organism .",
    "our script , called ppitrim , is written in the python programming language .",
    "it takes as input a dataset in irefindex psi - mi tab 2.6 format , with 54 tab - delimited columns ( 36 standard and 18 added by irefindex ) .",
    "after three major processing steps , it outputs a consolidated dataset , in psi - mi tab 2.6 format , containing only the 36 standard columns .",
    "the three processing steps are : ( i ) mapping all interactants to ncbi gene ids and removing all undesired raw interactions ; ( ii ) deflating potentially expanded complexes ; and ( iii ) at each step , ppitrim downloads the files it requires from the public repositories and writes its intermediate results as temporary files .",
    "the former is removed because it contains either computationally predicted interactions or interactions verified from the literature using text mining ( i.e. without human curation ) .    as a first step , the script seeks to map each interactant to an ncbi entrez gene  @xcite identifier . for most interactants",
    ", it uses the mapping already provided by irefindex . in the cases where irefindex provides only a uniprot  @xcite knowledge base accession ,",
    "the script attempts to obtain a gene i d is used to query the ncbi entrez gene database for a matching gene record using an eutils interface . if a single unambiguous match is found , the record s gene i d is used for the interactant .",
    "every mapped gene i d is checked against the list of obsolete gene ids , which are no longer considered to have a protein product existing _ in vivo_. the interactants that can not be mapped to valid ( non - obsolete ) gene ids are removed along with all raw interactions they participate in .    after assigning gene ids , the script considers the psi - mi ontology terms associated with interaction detection method , interaction type and interactants biological roles . using the full psi - mi ontology file in open biomedical ontology ( obo ) format  @xcite",
    ", it replaces any non - standard terms in these fields ( labeled mi:0000 ) with the corresponding valid psi - mi ontology terms .",
    "the terms marked as obsolete in the psi - mi obo file are exchanged for their recommended replacements .",
    "the single exception are the interaction detection method terms for hprd ` in vitro ' ( mi:0492 , translated from mi:0045 label in irefindex ) and ` in vivo ' ( mi:0493 ) interactions , which are kept throughout the entire processing .",
    "source interactions annotated with a descendant of the term mi:0415 ( enzymatic study ) as their detection method or with a descendant of the term mi:0414 ( enzymatic reaction ) as their interaction type are classified as candidate biochemical reactions .",
    "this category also includes any interactions ( including those with more than two interactants ) where one of interactants has a biological role of mi:0501 ( enzyme ) or mi:0502 ( enzyme target ) . in the recent months ,",
    "the biogrid database has started to provide additional information about the post - translational modifications associated with the ` biochemical activity ' interactions , such as phosphorylation , ubiquitination etc .",
    "this information is available from the biogrid datasets in the new tab2 format but is not yet reflected in the psi - mi terms for interaction type provided in the psi - mi 2.5 format or in irefindex . since the post - translational modifications annotated by the biogrid can be directly matched to standard psi - mi terms , the script downloads the most recent biogrid dataset in tab2 format , extracts this information and assigns appropriate psi - mi terms for interaction type to the candidate biochemical reactions from irefindex that originate from the biogrid .",
    "any source interaction not classified as candidate biochemical reaction is considered for assignment to the candidate complex categories .",
    "this category includes all true complexes ( having edge type ` c ' in irefindex ) , interactions having a descendant of mi:0004 ( affinity chromatography ) as the detection method term or mi:0403 ( colocalization ) as the interaction type , as well as the interactions corresponding to the biogrid s ` co - purification ' category . interactions with interaction type mi:0407 ( direct interaction ) are never considered candidates for complexes . all source interactions not falling into candidate biochemical reaction or candidate complex categories are considered ordinary binary physical interactions .      the phase ii script attempts to detect spoke - expanded complexes from ` candidate complex ' interactions and deflate them into interactions with multiple interactants .",
    "first , all candidate interactions are grouped according to their publication ( pubmed i d ) , source database , detection method and interaction type .",
    "each group of source interactions is turned into a graph and considered separately for consolidation into one or more complexes .",
    "when a portion of a group of interactions is deflated , we replace these source interactions by a complex containing all their participants .",
    "two procedures are used for consolidation : pattern detection and template matching ( fig .",
    "[ fig : complexes ] ) .        pattern detection procedure is used only for the interactions from the biogrid . unlike the interactions from the dip ,",
    "those interactions are inherently directed since one protein is always labeled as bait and other as prey ( in many cases this labeling is unrelated to the actual experimental roles of the proteins ) . the pattern indicating a possible spoke - expanded complex consists of a single bait being linked to many preys . since all interactions in the biogrid s co - purification and co - fractionation categories arise from complexes that are spoke - expanded using an arbitrary protein as a bait ( biogrid administration team , private communication ) , a bait linked to two or more preys can in that case always be considered an expanded complex and deflated .",
    "such deflated complexes are assigned the edge type code ` g ' .",
    "the remainder of the complex candidate interactions from the biogrid were obtained by affinity chromatography and are , in most cases , also derived from complexes .",
    "here we adopted a heuristic that a bait linked to at least three preys can be considered a complex .",
    "clearly , some experiments involve a single bait being used with many independent preys , in which case this procedure would generate a false complex .",
    "therefore , complexes generated in this way are assigned a different edge type code ( ` a ' ) and the user is able to specify specific publications to be excluded from consideration as well as the maximal size of the complex .",
    "the second procedure is based on matching each group of candidate interactions to the complexes indicated by other databases ( templates ) , mostly from intact , mint , dip and bind . in this case , the script checks for each protein in the group whether it , together with all its neighbors , is a superset of a template complex .",
    "if so , all the candidate interactions between the proteins within the complex are deflated .",
    "the neighborhood graph is undirected for all source databases except the biogrid .",
    "the new complexes generated in this way are given the code ` r ' .",
    "the scripts also attempts to use complexes generated from the biogrid s interactions through a pattern detection procedure as templates , in which case the newly generated complexes have the code ` n ' .",
    "any source interactions that can not be deflated into complexes are retained for phase iii .",
    "the dag structure of an ontology naturally induces a partial order between the terms : for two terms @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we say that @xmath0 refines @xmath1 ( @xmath0 is smaller @xmath1 , @xmath0 precedes @xmath1 ) if there exists a directed path in the dag from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "two psi - mi terms can be considered compatible if they are comparable , that is , one refines the other .",
    "every nonempty collection of terms @xmath2 can be uniquely split into disjoint sets @xmath3 , such that every @xmath3 has a single maximal element ( an element comparable to and not smaller than any other member ) and contains all members of @xmath2 comparable to its maximal element .",
    "every subcollection @xmath3 is then consistent because there exists at least one term within it that can describe all its members , while any two members from different subcollections are incomparable .",
    "finest consistent term _ of a subcollection @xmath3 is the smallest member of @xmath3 that is comparable to all its members ( it can also be defined as the smallest member of the intersection of the transitive closures of all the members of @xmath3 . ) .",
    "if @xmath3 is a total order , where all members are pairwise comparable , the finest consistent term is the minimal term .",
    "on the other hand , the minimal term need not exist ( fig .",
    "[ fig : example1 ] ) , so that the finest consistent term is higher in the hierarchy and represents the most specific annotation that can be assigned to @xmath3 as a whole .    to produce consolidated interactions from a single cluster ,",
    "each of its members ( interactions ) is identified with its psi - mi term for information detection method . for every cluster member , the set of all other members with compatible annotations (",
    "` compatible set ' ) is computed . as a special case ,",
    "the following detection method tags are treated as smaller than any other : ` unspecified method ' ( mi:0686 ) , ` in vivo ' and ` in vitro ' ( the latter two are from hprd only ) . in this way , non - specific annotations",
    "are considered as compatible with all other , more specific evidences .",
    "compatible sets are further grouped according to their maximal elements . within each group ,",
    "the union of the compatible sets produces a subcluster .",
    "the finest consistent term for each subcluster is found by considering all psi - mi terms on the paths from the subcluster members to its maximum  the search is not restricted to those terms that are within the subcluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : example1 ] ) .",
    "this definition takes into account that a source database may report an interaction several times for the same publication , using the same or different interaction detection method .",
    "if two databases annotate the same interaction using incompatible terms , this is most likely due to an error or specific disagreement about the appropriate label , rather than that each database is reporting a different experiment from the same publication .          to test ppitrim , we applied it to the yeast ( _ s .",
    "cerevisiae _ ) , human ( _ h .",
    "sapiens _ ) and fruitfly ( _ d . melanogaster _ ) datasets from irefindex release 8.0-beta , dated jan 19th 2011 .",
    "when processing the yeast dataset , we accounted for two special cases .",
    "first , we specifically removed the genetic interactions reported by @xcite because they were not labeled as genetic for all source databases .",
    "second , we excluded the dataset by @xcite from phase ii and retained all its interactions as binary undirected .",
    "the results of applying ppitrim to process irefindex 8.0 are shown in tables [ tbl : mapping2 ]  [ tbl : consolidate ] .",
    "we chose to standardize proteins using ncbi gene identifiers rather than the irefindex - provided canonical ids ( crogids ) for several reasons .",
    "ncbi gene records not only associate each gene with a set of reference sequences , but also include a wealth of additional data ( e.g. list of synonyms ) and links to other databases such as gene ontology  @xcite that are important when using the interaction dataset in practice .",
    "in addition , gene records are regularly updated and their status evaluated based on new evidence .",
    "thus , a gene record may be split into several new records or marked as obsolete if it corresponds to an orf that is known not to produce a protein . for network analysis applications ,",
    "it is desirable that only the proteins actually expressed in the cell are represented in the network and hence the gene status provided by ncbi gene is a valuable filtering criterion .",
    "however , crogids do have one advantage over ncbi gene ids in that they are protein - based and hence identical protein products of several genes ( like histones ) are clustered together .    around 10% of crogids",
    "could not be mapped to gene ids even after processing with ppitrim algorithms . a few interactors ( supplementary table 5 )",
    "have only pdb accessions as their primary ids since their interactions were derived from crystal structures . in such cases , often",
    "only partial sequences of participating proteins are available .",
    "these partial sequences can not be fully matched to any uniprot or refseq record and hence are assigned a separate i d .",
    "hence , an improvement for our procedure , that would account for this case as well as for those unmapped proteins that differ from canonical sequences only by few amino acids , would be to use direct sequence comparison to find the closest valid reference sequence .",
    "this task may not be technically difficult ( a similar procedure was applied by @xcite to construct protein databases for mass spectrometry data analysis ) but is beyond the scope of ppitrim , which is intended as a relatively short standalone script . in our opinion , such additional mappings would best be performed at the level of reference sequence databases such as uniprot or refseq , which contain curator expertise to resolve ambiguous cases .",
    "protein complexes obtained through chromatography techniques provide information complementary to direct binary interactions . while it is often difficult to determine the exact layout of within - complex pairwise interactions , an identification of an association of several proteins using mass spectroscopy is an evidence for _ in vivo _ existence of that association .",
    "unfortunately , in spite of its great importance , the currently available information within irefindex is deficient because of different treatments of complexes by different source databases .",
    "our results ( table  [ tbl : collapsing ] ) show that the apparently inflated complexity of interaction datasets can be substantially reduced by attempting to collapse spoke - expanded complexes .",
    "we feel that the benefits from reduction of interactome complexity outweigh the disadvantages from potentially over deflating interactions .",
    "the best way to solve would be at the level of source databases ( biogrid in particular ) , by reexamining the original publications .",
    "our complexes from the ` r ' category , where deflated complexes fully agree with an annotated complex from a different database , could serve as a guide in this case .",
    "overall , our processing significantly reduced the number of interactions within each of the three datasets considered ( table  [ tbl : consolidate ] ) .",
    "this indicates a significant redundancy , particularly for protein complexes , original and deflated ( compare table  [ tbl : collapsing ] with table  [ tbl : consolidate ] ) , and for binary interactions .",
    "the directed interactions ( biochemical reactions ) are relatively rarer and largely non - redundant at this stage . given their importance in elucidating biological function , the directed interactions are expected to be discovered more fully with time .    upon closer examination ( table  [ tbl : conflicts ] ) , it can be seen that most common conflicts arise as instances of few specific labeling disagreements between databases . in many cases ,",
    "such disagreements arise from using different sub - terms of affinity chromatography ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : example1 ] ) and can be resolved by assigning a more general term consistent with both conflicting terms . in many other cases ,",
    "the conflicts are due to biogrid internally using a more restricted detection method vocabulary than the imex databases ( dip , intact and mint ) .    the ppitrim algorithms work best if accurate and fully populated fields for interaction detection method , publication and interaction type are available in its input dataset .",
    "this requirement is mostly fulfilled .",
    "nevertheless , we have noticed two minor inconsistencies .",
    "the first , which will be fixed in a subsequent release of irefindex ( ian donaldson , private communication ) , involves the psi - mi labels for interaction detection method for corum interactions and complexes .",
    "these are missing from irefindex although they are present in the original corum source files .",
    "the second issue concerns missing or invalid pubmed ids for certain interactions .",
    "we found that a number of interactions with missing pubmed ids come from mint . upon inspection of the original mint files",
    ", we discovered that in many cases mint supplies a digital object identifier ( doi ) for a publication as its identifier instead of a pubmed i d ( although the corresponding pubmed i d can be obtained from the mint web interface ) .",
    "to ensure consistency with other source databases within irefindex , it would be desirable to have the pubmed ids available for these interactions as well .    in this paper",
    ", we have identified the tasks needed for using combined interaction datasets provided by irefindex as a basis for construction of reference networks and developed a script to process them into consistent consolidated datasets .",
    "we see ppitrim as answering a need for a consolidated database and hope that most of the issues that required processing will be eventually fixed in upstream databases and distributed through imex consortium . at this stage",
    "we have not addressed the issue of quality of interactions although such information is available in some databases for some publications  @xcite . utilizing the quality information in consolidating datasets",
    "demands a universal data - quality measure that is not yet existent .",
