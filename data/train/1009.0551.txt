    "<S> resistivity due to charge fluctuations is obtained within the mean field approach on the anderson impurity model . due to the linear spectrum of the graphene </S>",
    "<S> the kondo behavior is shown to depend on the gate voltage applied . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the impurity on the graphene sheet is an important variable determining its effect on the kondo scale and resitivity . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that for chemical potential near the node the charge fluctuations is responsible for the observed temperature dependence of resistivity while away from the node the spin fluctuations take over . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative agreement with experimental data is achieved if the energy of the impurity level varies linearly with the chemical potential . </S>"
