    "in spite of their small branching fraction , the exclusive semileptonic decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 are expected to become important processes to determine @xmath10 . a model independent calculation of the form factors relevant for these decay processes is possible using lattice qcd , and several attempts have already been made@xcite . to avoid problems associated with large heavy quark mass @xmath11 , however , these studies made simulations in the charm quark mass region and extrapolated results to the @xmath6 quark .    in this report",
    "we describe our examination of the heavy quark mass dependence of the form factors . for this purpose",
    "we employ the @xmath2-improved clover action in the formalism of the fnal group@xcite , and carry out simulations over a wide range of heavy quark mass including the bottom as well as charm quark masses@xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath12 with this formalism show that systematic errors due heavy quark are small enough for the @xmath6 quark@xcite , and we expect the systematic error to be also well under control for the form factors .",
    "we use the plaquette action and the clover action with the clover coefficient determined at the one - loop level@xcite .",
    "measurements are made at @xmath3 with 100 configurations on a @xmath4 lattice and 110 configurations on a @xmath13 lattice .",
    "the lattice scale is set by the @xmath14 meson mass which gives @xmath15  gev .",
    "six values of the heavy quark hopping parameter in the range @xmath16 are employed .",
    "the chiral limit is taken for the light quark with results obtained for the light quark hopping parameter in the range @xmath17 to the critical value @xmath18 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the form factors for the @xmath0 to @xmath19 decay are obtained from the heavy - to - light three - point function @xmath20 for the vector current @xmath21 by dividing out the appropriate two - point functions . the pseudo scalar fields @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 are smeared with the measured wave function obtained in ref .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is taken at rest ( @xmath24=0 ) and the pion is given up to a unit of momentum ( @xmath25=0 , @xmath26 ) , above which the signal becomes unacceptably noisy .",
    "the form factors for the @xmath0 to @xmath14 decay is obtained in a similar manner , for which we consider only the zero - recoil decay @xmath27 .",
    "we do not include the perturbative @xmath28 factor for the currents in this study , since results for finite heavy quark masses are not fully available .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral_extrapolation ] we plot @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 for @xmath33 which is near the @xmath6 quark mass . results for @xmath34 are for the minimal non - zero pion momentum .",
    "we observe that the dependence in @xmath32 is quite small for @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast there is a clear slope for @xmath31 , which differs from previous results@xcite . for the chiral extrapolation",
    "we adopt a linear form in @xmath35 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral_extrapolation ] , with which our results are consistent .",
    "heavy quark symmetry predicts that @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 scales toward the heavy quark mass limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f0sqrtm ] we plot @xmath39 in the chiral limit as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "we observe that a small @xmath40 correction , as suggested by results of previous studies performed around the charm quark mass@xcite , also holds in our data .",
    "furthermore the weak dependence persists to the region of @xmath6 quark mass .",
    "we also note a volume effect of about 10% between @xmath41 and @xmath13 lattices , which is statistically significant toward light meson masses .    in the chiral limit",
    ", an application of the soft pion technique predicts the relation @xmath42@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f0sqrtm ] we also plot @xmath43 ( crosses ) obtained in ref .",
    "there is a significant discrepancy with @xmath44 , particularly toward heavy quark masses .",
    "possible origins of the discrepancy are ( i ) subtleties in the chiral extrapolation of @xmath30 since @xmath45 changes with @xmath35 , ( ii ) systematic errors due to heavy quark including corrections from the @xmath28 factor , ( iii ) scaling violation and breaking of chiral symmetry for light quark .",
    "it is not clear at present if these could account for the large difference seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f0sqrtm ] .    the @xmath40 dependence of @xmath46 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] .",
    "it is negligible for this quantity .",
    "= 7.5 cm    for @xmath47 and @xmath34 the slope in the chiral extrapolation is almost independent of the heavy quark mass .",
    "therefore the @xmath40 dependence of these form factors is almost unchanged by the chiral extrapolation , as was seen in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , the large slope for @xmath48 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral_extrapolation ] becomes smaller as the heavy quark becomes lighter . as a result",
    "the @xmath40 behavior of @xmath48 depends significantly on the light quark mass as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1 ] , where we plot results at a finite light quark mass ( crosses ) together with that in the chiral limit(circles ) .",
    "previous studies@xcite performed on the charm quark mass region suggested that the @xmath40 dependence of the form factors is small contrary to the case of the heavy - light decay constant which varies significantly between the static limit and the region of charm quark .",
    "our calculation confirms this trend and extends it to the region of @xmath6 quark .",
    "this is particularly puzzling for @xmath47 for which we find a large violation of the soft pion relation @xmath49 .",
    "a weak @xmath40 dependence and a discrepancy from the soft pion relation are also observed if non - relativistic qcd is employed for heavy quark@xcite .",
    "we feel that further understanding of the heavy quark mass dependence is required for a reliable calculation of heavy - to - light form factors from lattice qcd .",
