    "<S> we discuss some fundamental concerns regarding the recent proposal of dimopoulos and giudice for dynamically aligning the soft masses of the sfermions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with the corresponding fermion masses to suppress flavor changing neutral currents . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the phenomenologically - favored presence of right - handed neutrinos in the theory , even if only at very high scales , generically disaligns the slepton mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> further suppression is then needed to meet the current upper bound on the rate for @xmath0 . planned improvements in the search for @xmath0 should easily detect this rare mode . </S>",
    "<S> ( with improved sensitivity @xmath1 may also be seen . ) by measuring the helicity of the amplitude for @xmath0 such experiments could distinguish between unified and non - unified models at very high energies ; by inserting the various mssm parameters as they become available , the mixing in the leptonic yukawa couplings can be extracted ; and by combining the results with those of various neutrino experiments some information about the right - handed neutrino majorana matrices can also be gained .    </S>",

    "<S> there are compelling theoretical and phenomenological reasons to believe that nature is supersymmetric on microscopic scales , and that the observed asymmetry at low energies between bosons and fermions is due to spontaneous susy breaking . </S>",
    "<S> much attention has been focused on the highly - successful minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , the mssm . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we address some aspects of this model and of its extension to include neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we analyze the implications of neutrino masses to a new mechanism recently introduced by dimopoulos , giudice and tetradis ( dgt ) @xcite to ameliorate the flavor problem of the mssm . in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we present their mechanism somewhat differently from their original work , and then focus on its implications to rare leptonic processes such as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> if the dgt mechanism is operative at a very large momentum scale @xmath3 , then data about such rare processes can be combined with results from direct susy searches and from various neutrino experiments to reveal important information about the leptonic couplings at the scale @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the long - standing problem which dgt have sought to solve is that of flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> if the soft mass matrices of squarks and sleptons are  as expected  not too far above the electroweak scale , and if they are neither proportional to unit matrices nor aligned with the corresponding fermion mass matrices , then they induce unacceptably large contributions to various fcnc processes , in particular neutral kaon oscillations and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> various mechanisms have been suggested to overcome this difficulty : if the gauginos are somewhat heavier than expected , they would raise the squark masses and make them roughly proportional to the unit matrix ( though the difficulties in the leptonic sector would be harder to overcome ) ; if the soft masses start out universal  proportional to the unit matrix  at a very high scale , they typically remain so in their first- and second - generation entries , and so contribute little to the two sensitive fcnc processes mentioned above ; and if some flavor symmetries align the squarks with the quarks and the sleptons with the leptons , then once again the fcnc contributions can be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> but the first two solutions have serious shortcomings : gaugino dominance requires unnaturally heavy gauginos and moreover is not very effective for @xmath4 ; and universal soft masses seem an unlikely outcome of various theories at the highest scales . </S>",
    "<S> the third approach postulates a set of approximate symmetries to explain both the observed fermion mass matrices and their alignment with the squark and slepton masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is somewhat similar in spirit to the approach of dgt , in that the same suppression mechanism which works in the quark and lepton sectors is applied to the susy - breaking sector , and generically yields similar fcnc suppression . </S>",
    "<S> the actual amount of suppression , though , varies considerably depending on the horizontal symmetries used , and can be stronger or weaker than in the dgt scenario . in any case , a thoroughly novel mechanism for suppressing fcnc s is very welcome . </S>",
    "<S> the recent proposal of dgt introduces just such a mechanism : a model , or more correctly a paradigm , in which the squark and slepton mass matrices are dynamically aligned with those of the corresponding fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we first present the idea and the assumptions of dgt somewhat differently than in the original proposal , focusing on the intrinsic link between any such dynamics and various fundamental concerns about the vacuum energy . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that even if such a mechanism is viable , and can greatly improve the situation in the quark sector , we do not expect it to be nearly sufficient in the lepton sector . in the paper of dtg individual lepton numbers were conserved , and therefore not surprisingly the slepton and lepton mass matrices were exactly aligned and no fcnc processes such as @xmath4 could occur . </S>",
    "<S> however , realistically we expect the lepton number symmetries to be violated in the neutrino sector for a variety of phenomenological reasons . </S>",
    "<S> as we show below , such violations will induce a misalignment between leptons and sleptons . </S>",
    "<S> though we can not at present predict the degree of misalignment precisely , we expect the effect to be phenomenologically important , and to yield valuable information about the leptonic flavor violations at very high energies .    in the standard model , </S>",
    "<S> flavor violation comes about exclusively through the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we can choose a basis for the quark fields such that the gauge interactions are flavor - conserving , as are the yukawa couplings of the leptons @xmath5 ( the hat indicates that the matrix is diagonal ) and of the down - type quarks @xmath6 , but then there is no more freedom to diagonalize the yukawa couplings of the up - type quarks @xmath7 : they are given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the ckm matrix . since the yukawa couplings of the first two quark generations are small and the mixing with the third generation is small , the standard model exhibits very feeble fcncs . in the lepton sector , flavor is exactly conserved .    </S>",
    "<S> the minimal extension of this standard model introduces eight more potentially flavor - violating matrices : the five scalar mass matrices @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and the three trilinear scalar coupling matrices @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we will choose once again to keep the gauge and gaugino interactions flavor - diagonal , and to do so we always rotate superpartners together . if we then stay with the above choice of basis for quark and lepton fields , we have no more freedom to diagonalize the eight new soft - susy - breaking matrices . </S>",
    "<S> if their off - diagonal terms are not suppressed relative to the diagonal ones , unacceptably large fcncs can arise , as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> we will concentrate first on the scalar masses , and then return to a discussion of the @xmath18 terms .    </S>",
    "<S> dgt have proposed that these scalar mass matrices be promoted to dynamical fields rather than be treated as mere parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage is that there may then exist a dynamical relaxation mechanism which would align these matrices with the yukawa matrices and thereby minimize the flavor - changing interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation may arise in string theory , where the low - energy field theory parameters are often dynamically determined by the vacuum expectation values of certain fields . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental , microscopic theory and the low - energy effective field theory are matched at a scale @xmath3 which we take to be of order the string or planck scales , but could also be some lower scale . </S>",
    "<S> the yukawa couplings are assumed to be fixed by the fundamental theory , perhaps by expectation values of fields with very large masses , so they are simply parameters of the effective theory . as for the scalar mass matrices , </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that their eigenvalues and orientations are determined by different mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we will only consider the `` disoriented '' scenario in which the eigenvalues are first fixed by some dynamics responsible for supersymmetry breaking , and then the orientations are dynamically determined by a set of light moduli fields . </S>",
    "<S> ( we call them `` moduli '' , with an abuse of language , because they would correspond to flat directions when either the yukawa couplings vanish or supersymmetry is unbroken . ) if we denote the scalar masses by @xmath19 matrices @xmath20 where @xmath21 runs over the five fields @xmath22 ( squark doublets ) , @xmath23 ( up - type antisquark singlets ) , @xmath24 ( down - type antisquark singlets ) , @xmath25 ( slepton doublets ) and @xmath26 ( charged slepton singlets ) , and diagonalize them by means of unitary matrices @xmath27 as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a real diagonal matrix , then the disoriented assumption amounts to promoting @xmath27 to dynamical fields , whose expectation value is determined by minimizing an effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> one could further expand the set of dynamical fields to include the eigenvalues @xmath29 , resulting in the `` plastication '' scenario of dgt , but we limit our discussion of this scenario to a brief remark towards the end of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> to determine what is the physics which fixes the alignment of the @xmath27 , we need to examine the exact effective potential of the theory , which includes the effects of quantum fluctuations from all scales . after allowing for possible new physics beyond the mssm at some intermediate susy - invariant scale @xmath30 between the cutoff @xmath3 and the effective susy - breaking scale @xmath31 in the observable sector , </S>",
    "<S> we may write the effective potential generically as @xmath32 where we have omitted a constant and any terms smaller than @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> since the first three terms do not involve any supersymmetry breaking , they must vanish inasmuch as the vacuum energy of a supersymmetric theory vanishes : @xmath34 . assuming a hierarchy @xmath35 , the dominant term would then be the @xmath36 part , which appears as a quadratic divergence in the low - energy effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss such divergences , and the possibility that they are absent , further below , and argue that not only are they expected , but that even if they vanish the main results of our work will not change . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will assume that the @xmath37 terms dominate and determine the orientation of the scalar masses . </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing that whatever mechanism is ultimately responsible for cancelling the cosmological constant , namely the constant term in @xmath38 , may have implications for the other terms in this potential , but we can not yet speculate on what those implications may be .    </S>",
    "<S> the direct consequence of this assumption , as noted already in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is that the physics which determines the alignment is the physics at the cutoff scale @xmath3 , namely , just at the scale in which the effective low - energy theory breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> all higher - dimension `` irrelevant '' operators are in principle as relevant as the renormalizable `` relevant '' ones . </S>",
    "<S> ( for instance , operators with four derivatives and a non - trivial flavor structure contribute to @xmath39 already at 1-loop order , potentially competing in an important way with the aligning `` force '' determined by the low energy yukawa couplings . ) </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is really the entire fundamental theory at the scale @xmath3 , rather than just its low - energy sector ( the mssm plus any additional new physics below @xmath3 ) , which sets the dynamics of the scalar mass orientations . since our experimental knowledge is limited to the low - energy sector while our theoretical understanding of the fundamental theory is not sufficiently advanced to calculated @xmath38 , we can not proceed further without some strong assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> this is a serious and apparently inherent weakness of this approach to solving the flavor problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can also be viewed favorably as affording us a window into the fundamental theory at the scale @xmath3 : sensitivity to such scales means that our predictions are not independent of this unknown realm , and therefore that they may be used to experimentally probe it .    </S>",
    "<S> what , then , can we say about the @xmath37 terms ? </S>",
    "<S> first , consider the radiative contribution of the mssm modes . </S>",
    "<S> the mssm would possess a global @xmath40 flavor symmetry if not only the dynamical fields @xmath20 would transform under this symmetry but also the yukawa couplings would transform appropriately . </S>",
    "<S> since the yukawa couplings are in fact fixed parameters , they are the spurions which carry the information about @xmath40 breaking . hence , to lowest order in these yukawa couplings , the mssm modes contribute @xmath41 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to the full effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath42 and also @xmath43 are numerical ( scalar ) coefficients which can only be calculated once the matching conditions are specified at the cutoff scale . fortunately , we only need to assume that they do not vanish . </S>",
    "<S> we also expect @xmath43 to be of order one ; indeed in the low energy mssm , @xmath44 to lowest order in the yukawa couplings and up to small hypercharge effects . then these mssm contributions align @xmath11 with the _ diagonal _ mass - squared matrix @xmath45 of the up - type quarks , @xmath12 with the _ diagonal _ mass - squared matrix @xmath46 of the down - type quarks , and @xmath10 with the _ non - diagonal _ linear combination @xmath47 . in the leptonic sector , there is only one spurion , the diagonal yukawa matrix @xmath48 , so both @xmath49 and @xmath14 align with it and become diagonal : individual lepton numbers are conserved .    </S>",
    "<S> operators with higher powers of the yukawa couplings will not significantly change the minimum configuration of the sfermion masses . </S>",
    "<S> this observation , based upon direct inspection of such operators , is independent of any additional suppressions from powers of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> one underlying reason is that the minimum configuration corresponds to points of enhanced flavor symmetry , thus off diagonal entries in the configuration will always be proportional to the appropriate ckm mixings violating those symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> additional suppressions arise because the yukawa coupling eigenvalues are hierarchical and mostly @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the @xmath52 entry of the matrix to which @xmath53 aligns will be of order @xmath54 ( in order to account for the chiral quantum numbers of the @xmath23 multiplet ) ; this matrix is close to being diagonal because when @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and also @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> of course , the mssm modes are but a small part of the theory at the cutoff scale , and we have already seen that it is this full fundamental theory which determined the alignment of the scalar masses . to make progress , therefore </S>",
    "<S> , we must make some strong assumption about the remaining physics . if it is completely arbitrary , the partial alignment which would result from the low - energy modes is generically destroyed . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the remaining physics is related to the yukawa couplings , in the sense that it preserves the same approximate symmetries , then the alignment can be preserved . </S>",
    "<S> this will therefore be our working assumption :    * the _ explicit _ ( rather than spontaneous ) flavor violations in the theory at the cutoff are _ entirely _ parametrized by the yukawa couplings , treated as spurions .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from this _ minimality assumption _ that the complete effective action has the same form as eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : veffmssm ] ) but with different coefficients , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective action will be minimized when the soft masses are as closely aligned as possible with the yukawa couplings , that is , when the approximate flavor symmetries are maximized . </S>",
    "<S> ( the ground state of many physical systems is the state of enhanced symmetry , so our results may have quite a wide range of applicability . ) </S>",
    "<S> the minimality assumption itself is very restrictive , and hence quite predictive . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from our predictions would indicate that there are new flavor violations in the cutoff theory which would normally be almost inaccessible to experimental probes . </S>",
    "<S> we will make this assumption throughout this work , and derive some quantitative phenomenological consequences . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted , however , that even if there are other sources of flavor violation which misalign the scalar masses , they are unlikely to cancel the ones we can calculate from our effective potential , and hence our predictions serve very generally as rough lower bounds on the expected experimental signals .    under the minimality assumption , the mass matrix of the squark doublets aligns with the linear combination @xmath60 . if we assume @xmath61 as suggested by @xmath62 , then the second term in the linear combination may be ignored relative to the first , and @xmath63 aligns approximately with the up - type yukawa couplings , that is , it is misaligned by the ckm matrix @xmath9 relative to the diagonal down - type quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> thus the strength of fcncs in the quark - squark sector is suppressed by the small off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath9 , and this is the extent to which the disorientation mechanism alleviates the flavor problem in this sector . </S>",
    "<S> ( recall that , unlike the orientations , the eigenvalues of the squark mass matrices are fixed parameters in our current non - plasticated discussion . ) disorientation sets the generic values of such quantities as @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 and @xmath67 mixings at ( or below ) their experimental values or bounds . on the other hand for the @xmath68 mass difference it is less effective@xcite , requiring a further suppression @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> we see that the disorientation mechanism suffices for satisfying most phenomenological bounds , but that some other solution  such as an accidental approximate degeneracy , an approximate universality , or perhaps plastication @xcite  is still needed , at least for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the usual bounds on supersymmetric parameters from @xmath71 mass difference are not greatly alleviated by disorientation simply because disorientation can only suppress flavor - changing neutral currents by a factor of the appropriate ckm angle , but a much greater suppression is mandated by the experimental value of @xmath72 , and is provided in the standard model by the lightness of the charm quark . </S>",
    "<S> other quantities , such as @xmath73 , which are sufficiently suppressed in the standard model by small ckm mixing angles , are indeed similarly suppressed in a disoriented scenario . )    </S>",
    "<S> what of the leptonic sector ? </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that for generic soft masses the bounds on fcncs from the radiative @xmath74 decay process @xmath4 are considerably stronger than the @xmath71 bounds . under the minimality assumption , </S>",
    "<S> the alignment is essentially determined by the yukawa couplings of the low - energy modes , which in the mssm conserve individual lepton numbers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xcite all fcncs in the lepton sector vanish . however , there is considerable evidence that individual lepton numbers are not in fact conserved in nature , and therefore that there is indeed low - energy physics beyond the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> the main indication comes from the solar neutrino flux , whose observed deficit can be explained by resonant ( msw ) neutrino oscillations @xcite favoring neutrino masses in the @xmath75 ev range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other , perhaps less compelling , indications come from the atmospheric neutrino problem and from the density fluctuations at large scales measured by cobe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this latter observation can be more easily explained provided a substantial fraction of the dark matter is hot @xcite . with the mssm particle content the only way to obtain that is to have some neutrino mass ( presumably the @xmath76 ) in the ev range . </S>",
    "<S> once we allow for flavor violation in the leptonic sector , then it is bound to show up in the slepton mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> almost all models for neutrino masses involve a majorana mass matrix @xmath77 for the singlet ( `` right - handed '' ) neutrino states , which also interact with the lepton doublets through a new set of yukawa couplings @xmath78 ; here we use the basis defined above in which @xmath79 is diagonal , so @xmath80 is the leptonic analog of the ckm matrix @xmath9 . in the quark sector </S>",
    "<S> there is a natural choice for which up - type quark to group with a given down - type quark in a single generation : one defines the three generations so as to make the ckm matrix close to the identity . in the leptonic sector </S>",
    "<S> we will find it convenient to define @xmath80 , in the above basis , as the matrix which brings @xmath81 into a diagonal form with _ increasing _ diagonal entries . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see below , the slepton masses will be aligned with @xmath80 , so to avoid excessive flavor - changing processes @xmath80 will have to be close to the identity up to a permutation matrix . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that this permutation matrix is the identity . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of @xmath77 are much larger than the weak scale , making the observed neutrinos mostly left - handed and very light via the see - saw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> leptonic flavor violation is parametrized by the misalignment matrix @xmath80 and by @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume , in the spirit of our previous minimality assumption and in agreement with phenomenological expectations , that @xmath82 ( where again @xmath3 is of order the planck or string scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the effective potential for the slepton masses will be of the form ( to lowest order in the yukawa couplings ) @xmath83\\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : vefflept}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the su(2)-singlet charged slepton masses align to lowest order with the mass - squared matrix of the charged leptons , and hence are diagonal in the basis we have chosen : @xmath84 but the presence of the right - handed neutrinos at the cutoff scale , and therefore of the yukawa couplings @xmath81 as spurions violating leptonic flavor symmetries , is enough to misalign the su(2)-doublet slepton mass matrices . the misalignment is frozen in at the scale @xmath3 , and so it remains even after the right - handed modes are integrated out of the low - energy theory . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity to the theory at the cutoff scale implies an insensitivity to the details of the decoupling of the right - handed neutrinos and to the flavor violation in @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as in the quark sector , we will assume that @xmath85 and that the yukawa couplings of the neutrinos are larger than those of the charged leptons : then @xmath86 aligns to a good precision with the yukawa couplings of the right - handed neutrinos and therefore is misaligned by the leptonic ckm matrix @xmath80 relative to the charged - lepton masses , @xmath87 much as @xmath10 was misaligned by the ckm matrix @xmath9 relative to the down - type quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the strength of leptonic fcncs is sensitive only to the matrix @xmath80 and not to the overall unknown size of the neutrino yukawa couplings . by measuring processes such as @xmath4 ( and @xmath1 ) and @xmath88 , we can directly probe these leptonic mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the above result does not necessarily require yukawa couplings @xmath89 in the neutrino sector  having @xmath90 suffices .    </S>",
    "<S> another potential source for flavor violations is the set of @xmath18-term matrices . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , various assumptions could be made about the @xmath18 terms : they are at once similar to the yukawa couplings , since they couple `` left''- and `` right''-handed modes , and to the scalar masses , since they break supersymmetry softly . </S>",
    "<S> if the orientation as well as the eigenvalues of the @xmath18 terms were fixed at the cut - off scale ( like the yukawa couplings ) , then to satisfy phenomenological bounds they would need to either be negligibly small or closely aligned with the yukawa couplings ; this would also follow from our minimality hypothesis ( which would require @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) , and is also one component of the commonly - made universality assumption . </S>",
    "<S> ( notice that fixed @xmath18-term orientations allow the @xmath27 soft - masses orientations to be regarded as pseudo - goldstone bosons of the flavor symmetries . ) alternatively , the @xmath18 terms may have fixed eigenvalues but dynamically - determined orientations ( like the soft masses ) : @xmath93 without loss of generality , we may arrange the ( diagonal ) entries of @xmath94 in ascending order . </S>",

    "<S> if in fact the eigenvalues are comparable to the hierarchical charged lepton masses , then they must also be at least roughly aligned , rather than antialigned , with the corresponding leptons in order to satisfy eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : aibound ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the issue of alignment , namely the expectation values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> the alignment of the @xmath100 is determined under the minimality assumption by a spurionic analysis similar to that for the sfermion masses . </S>",
    "<S> to proceed , we further postulate that the only parameters breaking the @xmath101 symmetry of the mssm are the soft ones , namely @xmath100 , the bilinear higgs coupling @xmath102 , and the gaugino mass parametrized by @xmath103 , all of which transform in the same way under r. this symmetry will allow only terms involving @xmath104 and @xmath105 but not any @xmath106 terms . then the operators determining the alignment of @xmath15 are given to lowest order by @xmath107 what alignment do these terms induce ? </S>",
    "<S> the first operator , @xmath108 , will likely dominate the alignment of @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> . it can be positive or negative , and has its largest magnitude when @xmath110 ( the unit matrix ) and @xmath111 ; hence for @xmath112 of any sign , the first term in the potential is always minimized when @xmath113 ( up to an overall sign ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the second operator is minimized when @xmath114 so it favors @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> next , to analyze the third term , we recall that @xmath116 and @xmath110 , that @xmath117 and @xmath118 are arranged in increasing order , and that @xmath119 and @xmath120 are strongly hierarchical ( unless the former is negligibly small ) ; then , up to terms of order @xmath121 for @xmath55 , the third term is minimized when @xmath122 . finally , the last operator in this potential is positive semidefinite , and attains its largest magnitude when @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> so if the coefficient @xmath124 is nonnegligible , it must be negative in order to lead to approximate alignment ( rather than antialignment ) of the charged sleptons with the charged leptons .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore the leptonic @xmath18 term relevant at low energies has the form @xmath125 where the fixed matrix @xmath126 is , up to phases , @xmath127 if the second operator in @xmath128 dominates over the second and third , and otherwise has entries comparable to @xmath80 . </S>",

    "<S> let us recollect our assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we assumed that the slepton mass matrix orientations were dynamical degrees of freedom fixed by a cut - off scale effective potential in which the flavor violations are entirely due to the yukawa couplings ( the minimality assumption ) , and second , when right handed neutrinos are added to the mssm to account for neutrino masses , we assume that @xmath81 are at least as large ( in a matrix sense ) as @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mealign ] ) and ( [ eq : mlalign ] ) for slepton masses : namely , the `` left - handed '' [ that is , su(2)-doublet ] soft slepton masses @xmath13 are misaligned relative to the charged lepton masses by the leptonic ckm matrix @xmath80 , while the `` right - handed '' soft slepton masses @xmath14 are closely aligned with the charged leptons . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath18 terms are not negligible , then we further assumed that their orientations are dynamical according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : widef ] ) , that their eigenvalues satisfy eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : aibound ] ) , that alignment rather than antialignment results from the effective potential , and that @xmath80 is close to the identity . </S>",
    "<S> the last three requirements simply allow the stability of the electroweak vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath18 terms are misaligned on their left - hand side by at most @xmath132 and are aligned with the charged leptons on their right - hand side .    with the low - energy soft susy - breaking parameters at hand , we may study the expected phenomenology and compare the results to current experimental bounds and to future experimental potential . </S>",
    "<S> we will concentrate on the radiative flavor - changing muon decay @xmath133 since it furnishes perhaps the most sensitive probe of these parameters , and since we anticipate its sensitivity to be greatly improved in the near future . with the above form for the soft terms , </S>",

    "<S> the amplitude responsible for this behavior is the oft - neglected @xmath185 , which is never negligible and which depends logarithmically on this hierarchy , dominating the amplitude by a factor of @xmath186 when the sfermions are @xmath187 times as heavy as the charginos . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a significant enhancement in the branching ratio when @xmath164 is large , as in many other processes which then require suppression to agree with experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the @xmath18 term contribution are often significant , especially when the `` left - handed '' soft - breaking masses are very nearly degenerate @xmath188    the size of leptonic mixings we have inserted is consistent with that suggested by the msw solution of the solar neutrino problem . actually , the @xmath80 mixings and the neutrino mixings observed at low energies ( via neutrino oscillations of various sorts ) are in general only indirectly related , via the majorana mass matrix @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are essentially equal when the eigenvalues of @xmath77 are all of the same order while those of @xmath81 are strongly hierarchical . with such mixings , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 and eq .  ( [ eq : brratio ] ) indicate that we need significant degeneracy in the slepton masses and a somewhat high susy - breaking scale to suppress @xmath2 below its experimental bound  in fact , roughly the same degeneracy and susy - breaking scale as were needed to satisfy the neutral kaon mixing constraints . </S>",
    "<S> thus the lepton sector fares no better ( and no worse ) than the quark sector in a disoriented scenario when neutrinos have sizeable yukawa couplings at the cut - off scale . </S>",
    "<S> admittedly , we have the freedom in the leptonic sector to assume that _ for some unknown reason _ the charged and neutral leptons are very closely aligned at the cut - off scale , in which case the mixing needed for the msw scenario must be provided by the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos . or we could assume that the yukawa couplings of the neutrinos are much smaller than those of the charged leptons , though this seems unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the susy - breaking scale must be at least several hundred gev , implying the usual fine - tuning problems for the z boson mass , or the left - handed slepton mass eigenvalues must be made highly degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> if the leptonic mixings @xmath189 are larger , say @xmath190 or even @xmath191 , then the susy - breaking scale must be raised further or the sleptons be made more degenerate to accommodate the experimental bounds .    </S>",
    "<S> these arguments will be greatly strengthened by the planned improvement in the experimental searches for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> current proposals call for sensitivity to branching ratios as low as @xmath192 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the disoriented scenario is correct , we certainly expect that @xmath2 will be observed in this next generation of experiments . by measuring that rate we would gain some direct information about the leptonic ckm matrix . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the other parameters affecting the branching ratio must be measured as well , but they will probably be determined within the coming decade .    </S>",
    "<S> the above predictions of the disoriented scenario should be contrasted with the effects of rg evolution in the universal scenario @xcite . in the latter flavor violating slepton masses vanish by fiat at the cut - off scale , but are induced at lower scales by the neutrino yukawa couplings via rg evolution : the diagonal slepton masses @xmath193 are augmented by @xmath194 , leading to a branching ratio given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : brratio ] ) but with a mass splitting @xmath195 . thus , </S>",
    "<S> unless the neutrino yukawa coupling is of order one , the slepton masses are highly degenerate and hence this rare @xmath74 decay is greatly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the disoriented scenario in effect allows @xmath196 to be a free observable parameter while keeping the degree of misalignment between leptons and sleptons small , namely @xmath197 .    </S>",
    "<S> what does the disoriented scenario predict when @xmath198 for some reason , such as plastication @xcite ? the only contributions to @xmath2 are those proportional to off - diagonal @xmath18 terms [ namely the @xmath199 term in @xmath200 and those involving the third family left - handed sleptons . when @xmath201 and the slepton mass is @xmath202 the resulting rate is just below the present bound ; for fixed gaugino mass , the rate decreases with the eighth power of the slepton mass , </S>",
    "<S> so heavy sleptons would only allow detection at the next generation of experiments . to account for mixing with the third family , the relevant mixing angle @xmath203 should be substituted for @xmath139 in the above calculation . </S>",
    "<S> assuming these have the same size as their quark sector counterpart , this contribution alone yields a branching ratio roughly an order of magnitude below the current bound even if the slepton masses are not degenerate and are @xmath204 .    </S>",
    "<S> our discussion so far has assumed that the orientations of squarks and sleptons are independent dynamical degrees of freedom . in the context of a grand - unified theory </S>",
    "<S> , the larger symmetry would typically reduce the number of independent orientations . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the result in a unified disoriented model is a sleptonic mixing angle of order the cabibbo angle @xmath205 , or perhaps of order @xmath206 in a more detailed and realistic model . </S>",
    "<S> since the mixing angle is larger than the @xmath207 we used above , the branching ratio of @xmath2 is also larger . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> we expect that in a disoriented gut scenario the superpartners are quite heavy or the charged sleptons of the first two generations are highly degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> third - generation and @xmath18 term effects are then important , and may dominate if @xmath208 is sufficiently small . in very simple disoriented gut models </S>",
    "<S> the misalignment may be only in the `` right - handed '' sector , but generically it is present in both sectors . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a disoriented gut scenario and a conventional gut ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a detailed analysis ) have similar predictions . </S>",
    "<S> they both differ qualitatively , however , from the disoriented non - unified scenario in an important way : the helicity of the amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown , in a non - unified disoriented scenario with only the mssm fields plus right - handed neutrinos at high scales , the process is completely dominated by the single helicity amplitude @xmath209 . on the other hand , in a realistic unified theory of flavor </S>",
    "<S> we expect flavor violations of comparable order in both the left- and right - handed sectors , while the minimal ( and unrealistic ) su(5 ) model produces only right - handed mixing . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in any unified theory we expect an amplitude for @xmath210 at least as large as @xmath209 . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , in the planned experiments the decaying muon is polarized , so if sufficiently many @xmath2 are observed , the angular distribution of the emitted electrons would reveal the helicity of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> a pure @xmath209 result would be difficult to understand in a generic unified theory ( disoriented or otherwise ) , but would be expected in a disoriented scenario if @xmath211 is the gauge group up to the cut - off scale .    </S>",
    "<S> another related rare @xmath74 decay is @xmath212 . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently observed @xcite that , in contrast to previous statements in the literature , the amplitude which dominates this branching ratio is not the box diagram but rather the ( photon ) penguin diagram . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , while the box contribution would be several orders of magnitude below the experimental bound , the penguin diagram yields a branching ratio @xcite @xmath213 which is comparable to the experimental bound when @xmath2 is close to its experimental bound . at present , @xmath1 yields slightly weaker constraints than @xmath2 ; only if the precision of @xmath1 experiments keeps pace with the planned improvements in @xmath2 searches will the former process remain competitive . as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the penguin diagram is enhanced by @xmath214 , which results from phase space integration as an electron and positron become collinear . ( the coefficient of the log is just determined by the qed @xmath215 function by requiring the cancellation of the infrared divergences in the inclusive rate to order @xmath216 . ) we should remark , however , that the experimental resolution may not allow highly collinear @xmath217 pairs to be distinguished from other processes ( including @xmath2 ! ) , so the the denominator in the log should be replaced by the appropriate minimum resolvable energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed throughout our discussion that the effective potential term @xmath218 , which appears as a quadratic divergences in the low - energy theory , dominates and fixes the dynamics which aligns the soft masses . </S>",
    "<S> such quadratic divergences are ubiquitous even in supersymmetric theories , when the supersymmetry is softly broken : while scalar masses are protected from quadratic divergences , the vacuum energy is not . </S>",
    "<S> could @xmath39 vanish in a particular theory ? without a symmetry argument , assuming @xmath219 is akin to assuming the higgs is light in a non - supersymmetric theory . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there have been studies where the vanishing of @xmath39 was invoked in order to proceed to a dynamical determination of the effective low energy parameters @xcite , and in particular of the gravitino mass itself . </S>",
    "<S> ( notice that not only @xmath39 but also any terms @xmath220 arising from intermediate scales must vanish , presumably by the same mechanism . ) </S>",
    "<S> while the implications of this idea are interesting , it is not clear yet how to implement it in an explicit field - theoretic model . as a matter of fact , to date the only available examples @xcite satisfy @xmath219 only at 1-loop order ( see @xcite for an explicit example of its violation at 2-loop order ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if such an implementation were found , making @xmath221 , there would still be two contributions : one from the mssm modes , and one which remains as a boundary term from matching the low- and high - energy theories . while the first contribution is determined to lowest order by the 1-loop rg evolution of the higgs mass and of the cosmological constant , and is @xmath222 , the second contribution @xmath223 is in principle unknown . </S>",
    "<S> the first contribution yields a phenomenology similar to the one we have studied throughout most of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the second can only be controlled by making our minimality assumption ( or some equivalently strong assumption)and then , again , similar predictions would be made . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know the relative size of the two contributions . </S>",
    "<S> if we were to treat @xmath224 as a usual threshold correction arising from 1-loop field - theoretic diagrams , we would expect it to be @xmath225 and hence subdominant in the limit @xmath226 , thus weakening the dependence on unknown cut - off physics . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the mssm contributions are suppressed by small yukawa couplings . in the end </S>",
    "<S> , we must plead at least as much ignorance about the @xmath219 case as about the @xmath227 case , and so the minimality assumption is unavoidable .    finally , we comment briefly on cp violation . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the issue of dynamical cp phases was discussed in the context of the mssm with universal soft terms . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that , when the phases of @xmath18 , @xmath103 , @xmath74 and @xmath228 are promoted to dynamical variables , the only cp - violating effects have a ckm origin , _ i.e. _ arise from the jarlskog invariant @xmath229 , and thus are suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this was under the strong assumption that no new sources of explicit cp violation are present . </S>",
    "<S> the same conclusion can be reached in the non - universal case discussed here , under the parallel assumption that the coefficients in the effective potential are real . to understand this observation , </S>",
    "<S> consider the limit in which the quark and lepton jarlskog invariants @xmath230 vanish , and choose a flavor basis in which the yukawa matrices are real : in this basis also the soft terms relax to real matrices . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the invariant @xmath229 enters the effective potential at higher - loop order , so its effect on the cp - violating phases is further suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in a non - universal scenario , cp violation is already present in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mlalign ] ) and ( [ eq : aealign ] ) , and has no further loop suppressions . but as long as @xmath231 is not much larger than its quark counterpart @xmath232 , no additional loop suppressions are needed to ensure that cp - violating quantities such as electric dipole moments are sufficiently small .    </S>",
