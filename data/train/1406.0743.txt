    "on 22 september 2011 at 10:29ut , an x - ray flare ( goes class x1.4 ) began in an active region located on the east limb of the sun ( noaa active region 11302 ; n13e78 ) .",
    "approximately 11 minutes after the flare start time , a bright wave - like front ( cbf ) was observed propagating away from the southern edge of the active region in sdo / atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 21.1 nm passband images .",
    "the cbf then propagated along the east limb from @xmath215@xmath6south to @xmath250@xmath6south of the equator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_aia_nrh_c2 ] ) . during the same period of the cbf propagation , a bright 150.9mhz source formed above the cbf , imaged using the nanay radioheliograph ( nrh ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( contours fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_aia_nrh_c2 ] ) . in each image",
    "the contours range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , where @xmath7 is the peak brightness temperature at the time of the image ; the intensity of the contours is indicated by the colour bar on the right .",
    "initially , both the erupting structure seen in the aia image and the radio source had the same spatial extent over latitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_aia_nrh_c2]a ) , showing they belong to a common structure . after this",
    ", the most southern part of the radio source reached an extremely high brightness temperature ( @xmath210@xmath9k ) and closely followed the propagation of the cbf southward until it eventually diminished into the thermal background at 10:56ut .",
    "another emission source at 150.9mhz was also observed at @xmath2@xmath10 latitude on the east limb at a height of 1.11.3@xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_aia_nrh_c2]c , d , e , f ) ; while this source was clearly associated with the eruptive active region , any link between it and the cbf is secondary , as it shows no temporal relationship with the start and stop time of the bright front .",
    "similar radio source motion is observed at 173 , 228 and 270mhz , however any co - propagation of these radio sources with the cbf is of much shorter duration .",
    "a movie showing the co - propagation of the cbf and 150mhz radio source can be found in supplementary movie 1 . for a movie and discussion of the multi - thermal nature of the cbf see supplementary movie 2 .    to compare the motion of the cbf and radio source , the position angle ( pa ) trajectories",
    "were analyzed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angle_time ] ) . both the cbf and radio source",
    "clearly show common kinematics , with the two features having a consistent progression southward around the east limb .",
    "the solid lines show a fit of @xmath12 to the data , where @xmath13 is the starting pa , @xmath14 is the angular velocity , and @xmath15 is time .",
    "the slope of each line gives @xmath14 , from which the velocity of the source may be obtained using @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance of the source from sun center .",
    "for the cbf , an angular velocity of @xmath18rads@xmath5 was obtained , resulting in a velocity of @xmath19kms@xmath5 at @xmath20 . at @xmath21 ,",
    "the cbf was found to have an angular velocity of @xmath22rads@xmath5 , resulting in @xmath23kms@xmath5 .",
    "the 150mhz source had an angular velocity of @xmath24 ; the value for @xmath17 of this source was estimated by directly converting frequency @xmath25 to electron density @xmath26 , using the methods described in supplementary material .",
    "this gave a height of @xmath27 for the radio source , resulting in a velocity of @xmath28kms@xmath5 .",
    "this velocity is larger than the cbf velocity at @xmath20 , but is comparable to the cbf velocity at @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angle_time ] ) .",
    "the similar speeds and trajectories of the cbf and radio source suggest that they belong to a common propagating structure in the corona .",
    "finally , the radio source motion speed was used to estimate its alfvn mach number @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the alfvn speed determined from magnetic field and density measurements at the radio source height ( see supplementary material ) . with @xmath31kms@xmath5 ,",
    "the alfvn mach number of the radio source is @xmath0 , showing that the source travelled in excess of the local wave speed in the corona .",
    "finally , we note that a potential field source surface extrapolation ( pfss ) reveals the presence of open and radial field in the south east quadrant of the corona ( see supplementary figure 2 ) , revealing that the propagation was transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "this is an important aspect of quasi - perpendicular shock orientation that we discuss in the last section .",
    "the 150mhz source observed by nrh had a brightness temperature of @xmath2@xmath32k , indicating coherent plasma emission .",
    "such emission is generated via plasma oscillations that are due to instabilities in the presence of high velocity electron beams @xcite .",
    "the presence of electron beams was independently verified and revealed in detail using radio dynamic spectra . at @xmath210:40ut",
    "the fundamental and harmonic bands of a type ii burst shock signature was observed at 45 and 90mhz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_spec]b ) , respectively , using the nanay decametric array ( nda ; * ? ? ?",
    "type iii bursts begin at the same time as the type ii ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_spec]a , b ) , observed using nasa s stereo - b / waves instrument @xcite .",
    "the frequency drift of these type iii radio bursts provide a measure of velocity of the electrons causing the radio emission . converting frequency - time measurements to height - time via a coronal density model ( see supplementary material ) , the beam speed was estimated to be @xmath330.4c ( 46kev ) , where c is the speed of light .",
    "this is a clear signature of relativistic electron acceleration in association with the shock .",
    "these particles were eventually detected in - situ by the stereo - b spacecraft ( see supplementary figure 3 ) .",
    "more striking evidence for shock - accelerated electrons is in the form of ` herringbone ' emission , observed using the ecallisto spectrometers @xcite at the rosse solar terrestrial observatory ( rsto ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_spec]c ) .",
    "the herringbones result from individual beams of shock - accelerated electrons @xcite , traveling towards and away from the sun i.e. , to higher and lower frequencies .",
    "similar features occur between 100200mhz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_spec]b ) , showing the same characteristics as herringbones ( a bursty nature and decreasing intensity with respect to time ) . in a similar manner to the type iii bursts ,",
    "the beam velocity of herringbone electrons was estimated to be 0.15c , again showing the presence of near - relativistic electron acceleration in association with the presence of a shock .",
    "while their structure in frequency reveal how fast these beams travel , their behavior in time can reveal detailed temporal characteristics of the shock acceleration process .",
    "a wavelet analysis using a derivative of a gaussian wavelet performed on a time series at 54mhz reveals periodicity at 211  seconds ( see supplementary figure 1 ) .",
    "previous authors have attributed this bursty nature to rippling and inhomogeneity along the shock front , possibly revealing some level of instability or shock turbulence in the acceleration region @xcite ; we discuss this in the last section .",
    "we note that the features at 100200mhz appear to be the extension of the herringbones into higher frequencies .",
    "these features in particular show good temporal correspondence with the radio source i.e. , they have a start - stop time comparable to the radio source .",
    "this is particularly apparent for the group of bursts at 10:5210:56ut ( supplementary movie 1 ) .",
    "the radio emission in the dynamic spectra have all the hallmarks of shock generation with particle acceleration closely tied to the process .",
    "the association of shock radio activity with the imaged 150mhz source suggests that the two observables have a common origin in a plasma shock .",
    "overall , the position of the radio source at the southern flank of the cme , the transverse motion of the source ( propagation parallel to the surface ) and the zero frequency - drift of the herringbones is suggestive of a shock driven parallel to the surface by the flank expansion , similar to the assertion by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed the association of the cbf with this radio activity is corroborative evidence of the wave / shock system at the flank .",
    "further evidence of a shock having occurred in the corona was obtained through white - light observations , allowing us to study the position of this shock relative to the cme .",
    "a cme associated with this event was observed by the large angle spectroscopic coronagraph ( lasco ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , first appearing at 10:46ut , with an apex heliocentric distance of @xmath22.6@xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_aia_nrh_c2]c ) .",
    "the next available image shows the bright cme front with a fainter , secondary front at the southern flank ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wl_shock]b ) .",
    "this ` two - front ' morphology is a common occurrence in white - light cme structure and constitutes a reliable signature of a cme front associated with a stand - off shock @xcite . in order to distinguish between the cme front and shock front",
    ", we performed a 3d reconstruction of the cme using the elliptical tie - pointing method described in @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wl_shock]d ) .",
    "this reconstruction reveals that the bright front outlined in the c2 coronagraph ( ellipse in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl_shock]b ) corresponds to the faint front outlined as a halo in stereo - b cor1 ( ellipse in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl_shock]c ) .",
    "furthermore , the observations reveal that the secondary and extremely faint front at the southern edge of the cme ( as imaged in lasco / c2 ,  fig .",
    "[ fig : wl_shock]b ) can not be considered as part of the cme structure , but is actually an associated shock front .",
    "we note that white - light shocks have been reported in the past , occurring both in the low corona as well as out to @xmath20.5a.u .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we have employed a 3d reconstruction from multi - viewpoint observations to qualitatively confirm the presence of a shock at the southern flank of the cme , in the same region as the cbf and radio burst .",
    "there has been much debate surrounding the assertion that cbfs are a wave phenomenon @xcite , with numerous authors suggesting a pseudo - wave theory @xcite . in the past",
    ", the association of cbfs with type ii and type iii bursts has been used as evidence against this pseudo - wave interpretation and more in favor of the mhd wave paradigm @xcite .",
    "this study reveals that the cbf in this event was indeed closely associated with shock radio activity positioned on the flanks of an expanding cme .",
    "this kind of behavior has been suggested before , but never directly imaged @xcite .",
    "it shows how a combination of radio and euv imaging can reveal the evolution of plasmoid driven shocks in the solar atmosphere @xcite .    of further interest in this study",
    "is the likelihood of a quasi - perpendicular orientation of the shock , as revealed by the pfss extrapolation .",
    "quasi - perpendicularity is an essential aspect of the shock drift acceleration ( sda ) mechanism @xcite , a process believed to be responsible for particle acceleration in planetary magnetospheres @xcite and solar radio bursts @xcite .",
    "this mechanism involves an adiabatic reflection of particles from the shock , with the energy gain sourced in the @xmath35 electric field , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the upstream flow speed and magnetic field , respectively . a single reflection from the shock has limited energy gain , however multiple reflections may produce relativistic energies , which is particularly important for low mach number shocks such as that reported here ( @xmath38 ) and in @xcite .",
    "this multiple reflection process may be explained by inhomogeneity in the shock front , a characteristic usually known as rippling @xcite .",
    "2d hybrid simulations show that rippling is brought about by an instability @xcite and resembles a standing - wave mode of the shock surface @xcite .",
    "the presence of ripples can lead to a quasi - sinusoidal variation in shock - normal orientation with respect to the upstream magnetic field .",
    "since the efficiency of sda requires quasi - perpendicularity , there will be sites on the shock front that provide efficient acceleration and sites that do not @xmath39 a structure that may lead to magnetic trapping and multiple reflections @xcite , hence producing higher energy particle acceleration .",
    "the presence of ripples can produce quasi - periodic herringbones in three ways .",
    "firstly , it makes sda more efficient and capable of producing the observed herringbone energies , especially when particle scattering is considered @xcite .",
    "secondly , the periodic spatial variation in the acceleration efficiency of the shock could explain the bursty and quasi - periodic nature of the herringbones ( supplementary figure 1 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that shock front inhomogeneity brought about by mhd turbulence is a possible explanation of bursty herringbones .",
    "@xcite produced a detailed model of sda from a rippled shock , specifically on the flanks of an expanding cme .",
    "their results suggest that herringbones could be produced by accelerated electrons at spatially intermittent regions of quasi - perpendicularity on a rippled shock surface .",
    "thirdly , @xcite also predicts that , if rippling is present , the upstream and downstream electron beams should have similar energies , which is not predicted for a uniform or smooth shock . a sample of the oppositely drifting herringbones in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_spec]c shows that positive and negative frequency drifts are both @xmath25mhzs@xmath5 , revealing that the upstream and downstream populations have similar energies ( although we note the possibility that both positive and negative drifting herringbone features may be accelerated upstream , as suggested by the schematic of @xcite ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that the herringbones may be associated with a termination shock of a reconnection outflow occurring behind the cme @xcite . in such a scenario , this shock would have a more indirect relationship with the cme propagation .",
    "however , the imaged radio source shows a good temporal correspondence with the shock activity in the dynamic spectra , especially between 10:52@xmath3910:56ut , suggesting the particle acceleration indicated in the spectra shares a close relationship with the propagating source .",
    "our observations reveal the need for a more detailed modeling of herringbone solar radio bursts .",
    "the quasi - periodic behavior of herringbones provides a possible direct measure of shock inhomogeneity and the spatial scales over which the magnetic field varies in the shock and ambient corona ; it may also provide a measure of the turbulence in these plasma flows @xcite . in the future , high cadence euv imaging from sdo , combined with sensitive radio imaging - spectroscopy observations from instruments such as the low frequency array ( lofar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will reveal unprecedented detail of plasma shocks and their role in particle acceleration .",
    "this may reveal the fundamental nature of a plasma shock process that is universal , but currently impossible to directly observe in any other area of astrophysics .",
    "we would like to thank nasa s sdo , stereo , and esa / nasa s soho teams , and the nanay radio astronomy observatory for providing open access to their data .",
