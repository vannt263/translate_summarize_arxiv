    "it is commonly assumed that bipolar nebulae around massive stars consist of slow ambient material ejected as a red supergiant that is swept - up by the faster wind of a hot supergiant . to create the bipolar shape",
    ", the surrounding slow wind must have an equatorial density enhancement ( i.e. a disk ) ; the consequent mass loading near the equator slows the expansion and gives rise to a pinched waist and bipolar structure .",
    "however , it is unclear how the required pre - existing disk could have been formed .",
    "one does not normally expect rsg or agb stars to rotate rapidly , so a disk - shedding scenario probably requires the tidal influence of a companion star during prior evolutionary phases in order to add sufficient angular momentum . in the case of sn  1987a",
    ", a binary merger would be required for this particular scenario to work ( collins et al .",
    "1999 ; podsiadlowski , these proceedings ) . however , there are reasons to question a binary merger scenario for the formation of sn1987a s nebula :    \\1 .",
    "a merger model followed by a transition from a rsg to bsg requires that these two events be synchronized with the supernova event itself , requiring that the best observed supernova in history also happens to be a very rare event .",
    "one could easily argue , though , that the merger and the blue loop scenario would not need to have been invented if sn1987a had occurred in a more distant galaxy where it would not have been so well - observed ( i.e. we would nt know about the bipolar nebula or its bsg progenitor ) .",
    "admittedly , this is a bit of a `` faith - based '' argument .",
    "after the rsg swallowed a companion star and then contracted to become a bsg , it should have been rotating at or near its critical breakup velocity .",
    "even though pre - explosion spectra ( walborn et al.1989 ) do not have sufficient resolution to measure line profiles , sk69@xmath3202 showed no evidence of rapid rotation ( e.g. , like a b[e ] star spectrum ) .",
    "instead , sk69@xmath3202 had the spectrum of an entirely normal b3 supergiant .",
    "particularly troublesome is that this merger and rsg / bsg transition would need to occur twice . from an analysis of light",
    "echoes for up to 16 yr after the supernova , sugerman et al .",
    "( 2005 ; in addition , see the contribution by arlin crotts in these proceedings ) have identified a much larger bipolar nebula with the _ same axis orientation _ as the more famous inner triple ring nebula .",
    "if a merger and rsg / bsg transition are to blame for the bipolarity in the triple - ring nebula , then what caused it in the older one ?",
    "perhaps a more natural explanation would be that sk69@xmath3202 suffered a few episodic mass ejections analogous to luminous blue variable ( lbv ) eruptions in its bsg phase ( see smith 2007 ) .",
    "there is mounting evidence that lbvs do , in fact , explode as supernovae ( see gal - yam et al .  2007 ;",
    "smith et al .",
    "2007b ; smith 2007 ; smith & owocki 2006 ; kotak & vink 2006 ) .",
    "we all know this is not supposed to happen , because we expect very massive stars to shed their hydrogen envelopes and live on for another few hundred thousand years as wolf - rayet stars after the lbv phase . the empirical evidence that some massive stars seem to die prematurely as lbvs therefore presents a challenge to current evolution models .",
    "it also highlights our poor understanding of the lbv phase , since these stars , at least the more massive ones , are supposed to be in transition from the end of core - h burning to core - he burning .",
    "we normally think of the lbvs as a late stage of evolution for very massive stars with initial masses above 4050 m@xmath2 on their way to becoming wolf - rayet stars . however , there is also a lower - luminosity group of lbvs exhibiting similar behavior that fall in a range of luminosities corresponding to initial masses of 2535 m@xmath2 ( see smith , vink , & de koter 2004 ) .",
    "these lower - luminosity lbvs are generally assumed to be post - rsgs in order that rsg mass loss has lowered their m / l ratio enough to make them susceptible to the lbv instability .",
    "although they are not normally discussed as potential sn progenitors in the literature , we should expect them to be  as post - rsgs , these lower - luminosity lbvs likely represent their final evolutionary state ( i.e. they will not become wr stars , because empirical studies show that all wr stars come from stars with initial masses above 30 m@xmath2 , and most above 50 m@xmath2 ; humphreys , nichols , & massey 1985 ) .",
    "the lower luminosity boundary of this lbv group is not clearly established by observations .",
    "sk69  202 is thought to have had an initial mass close to 20 m@xmath2 , and at first glance this seems too low to allow it to be a normal lbv .",
    "however , the b[e ] star r4 in the small magellanic cloud may offer a precedent at the same luminosity as the progenitor of sn1987a ; r4 is consistent with a 20 m@xmath2 evolutionary track , and it experienced an lbv outburst in the late 1980 s ( zickgraf et al .",
    "r4 also has elevated nitrogen abundances comparable to the nebula around sn  1987a , so it is also a post - rsg star . as we will see below , two other ringed blue supergiant stars have similar low initial masses of 20 to 25 m@xmath2 .",
    "m spitzer / irac image of the lbv candidate hd168625 from smith ( 2007 ) .",
    "it shows a nebula with a geometry very much like that around sn1987a , but in this case the bipolar shape probably originated during the ejection by the central lbv star and not from interacting winds . ]",
    "we can gain further insight to the formation of sn1987a s ring nebula and its pre - sn evolutionary state by studying analogs of it around massive stars in our own galaxy and asking what those stars are like .",
    "are they post - merger products ?",
    "close binaries ?",
    "rapid rotators ?",
    "do their chemical abundances indicate post - rsg evolution ?",
    "three close analogs in the milky way are currently known :    * sher 25 in ngc3603 : * hst images of this b1.5 supergiant ( not shown here ) reveal a remarkable equatorial ring with the same radius as the one around sn1987a , plus bipolar ejecta ( brandner et al.1997 ) .",
    "although the nebula has moderate n - enrichment , smartt et al.(2002 ) find that the n abundance is too low to be the result of post - rsg evolution .",
    "in fact , the stellar luminosity is above the limit where no rsgs are seen .",
    "thus , the nebula around sher 25 probably did not form from interacting winds during a rsg - bsg transition .",
    "the star s spectrum shows fairly narrow lines ( smartt et al .",
    "2002 ) and there is not indication that it is an extremely rapid rotator ( we know sin @xmath4 , presumably , from the tilt angle of the nebular ring ) .",
    "it is also not yt known to be a close binary ",
    "although if it is a binary , that obviously rules out the merger hypothesis because the ring has already formed .    * hd168625 near m17 : * this lbv candidate has a luminosity much closer to the progenitor of sn1987a than sher 25 , consistent with an initial mass of @xmath125 m@xmath2 .",
    "its nebula has an equatorial ring , and it is the only object known so far to also show polar rings like sn1987a ( fig .  1 ; see smith 2007 ) .",
    "this nebula makes it our galaxy s closest analog to the one around the progenitor of sn1987a .",
    "its lbv status is interesting , since lbvs are known to have eruptive episodes of high mass loss ( e.g. , smith & owocki 2006 ) and are often surrounded by bipolar nebulae .",
    "based on various observed properties of the nebula , i have argued ( smith 2007 ) that the nebula was probaby ejected as an lbv rather than ejected as a rsg and shaped afterward by a fast bsg wind .",
    "the central sttar has been studied extensively in order to study its possible lbv - like variability ( e.g. , chentsov & gorda 2004 ) .",
    "it is not a rapid rotator and is not known to be a binary .",
    "its nebula may be moderately enhanced with cno products , although uncertainties in the n abundance ( nota et al .",
    "1996 ) make it difficult to determine if it really is a post - rsg .",
    "* sbw1 in the carina nebula : * this equatorial ring nebula ( fig .  2 ) also has the same 0.2  pc radius as the one around sn1987a , and the central b1.5 supergiant has essentially the same luminosity as sk-69@xmath3202 , consistent with an initial mass of roughly 20 m@xmath2 . the age and expansion speed of the ring around sbw1",
    "are within a factor of 2 of the equatorial ring of sn1987a .",
    "it is seen toward the carina nebula , but it is probably more distant , at @xmath17kpc ( smith et al .",
    "its nebula shows no evidence for n - enrichment ; the n abundance is roughly solar ( smith et al  2007a ) .",
    "thus , this ring formed even though the star has never been a rsg .",
    "the central star is not an extremely rapid rotator either ( smith et al.2007a ) .",
    "image of the ring nebula sbw1 in the carina nebula from smith et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , surrounding a b1.5 iab supergiant .",
    "it has the same radius ( 0.2 pc ) as the ring around sn1987a and the star has the same luminosity as the progenitor of sn1987a , but it has solar n abunance , indicating that it has not yet been a rsg .",
    "in addition to the equatorial ring , it appears to have faint bipolar lobes as well . ]",
    "of the three examples of ring nebulae around bsgs that are our galaxy s closest known analogs to the nebula around the progenitor of sn1987a , two could not have been red supergiants because of their chemical abundances , and one was ejected as an lbv .",
    "thus , of the three examples known , _",
    "none _ were formed by interacting winds during a rsg to bsg transition .",
    "this proves that there must be some other physical mechanism that can eject equatorial rings and bipolar nebulae .",
    "the best candidate is an intrinsically bipolar ejection by a rotating lbv , or an episodic mass ejection analogous to lbv outbursts .",
    "the star does not necessarily need to have a high angular velocity , as the effects of rotational shaping can be enhanced in a star with even moderate angular speed if it is near the eddington limit .",
    "( during lbv eruptions , the star is thought to increase its bolometric luminosity and approach or even exceed the eddington limit . )",
    "this also hints that sn1987a and other type ii sne with circumstellar material did not necessarily transition recently from the rsg phase ; instead , they may have been in an lbv - like phase before explosion .",
    "if lbvs can be sn progenitors , it puts a rather embarassing spotlight on our current lack of an explanation for the lbv instability .",
    "so , the obvious question then is whether or not a single rotating star is able to produce a triple - ring nebula like sn1987a s during an lbv - like event .",
    "i mean , come on  how can a star do that ?",
    "this challenge for a single star model is all the more daunting considering how well phil podsiadlowski s merger model can explain the detailed structure of the nebula ( see podsiadlowski , these proceedings ; morris & podsiadlowski 2007 ) .",
    "i was quite impressed by that , but i m not ready to throw in the towel just yet .",
    "as i noted earlier , the key obstacles for the binary merger / wind - interaction model are that it requires the nearest sn in 400 years to be nearly synchronized with an extremely unlikely event , it requires that the merger product was an extremely rapid rotator contrary to observations , and it needs to have happened at least twice ( ! ) because the outer nebula has the same bipolar axis .",
    "these three obstacles are eliminated for the lbv - ejection hypothesis because the timescale between successive lbv eruptions of a few thousand years is comparable to the dynamical time of the nebula ( no longer synchronized ) , extremely rapid rotation ( i.e. high angular velocity ) is not needed to achieve critical rotation because of the reduced @xmath5 near the eddington limit , and we know that lbv eruptions happen repeatedly with the same bipolar geometry ( the best example of that is @xmath6 car ; see smith 2005 ) .",
    "i should be clear that in this scenario , sk69 202 was still in a post - rsg phase as required by its chemical abundances , but it did not need to explode so soon after making the rsg - bsg transition .",
    "it could have made that transition and then could have been in an lbv phase for @xmath110@xmath7 years , during which time it suffered a few major lbv - like mass ejection episodes separated by thousands of years before finally exploding .",
    "now , i ll admit that i m still at a bit of a loss as to how one might form the triple rings in this scenario .",
    "( however , keep in mind that the lbv star hd168625 was apparently able to form equatorial and polar rings , and its central star is not a rapidly - rotating post - merger product and is not known to be a binary despite attempts to monitor its spectral variability . )",
    "that seems like a difficult hydro problem connected to the mass ejection mechanism itself ( see below ) .",
    "however , there is a relatively simple explanation for how a single rotating star might produce an equatorial disk / ring _ and _ bipolar lobes simultaneously .",
    "tis is a logical first step , or a prerequisite , toward producing an equatorial ring with a pair of polar rings in a single - star scenario .",
    "suppose that a rotating star increases its luminosity during an lbv eruption , and reaches near - critical rotation while ejecting matter from its surface .",
    "that star will be oblate and will likely have substantial gravity darkening ( e.g. , von zeipel 1924 ) , leading to a faster and denser polar wind ( e.g. , owocki et al.1996 ) . for a short duration ejection , this will naturally lead to a pair of hollow bipolar lobes after expansion to large radii .",
    "there is a competing effect that will also enhance the density at the equator . at latitudes near the equator where ejection speeds are low or comparable to the rotational speed",
    ", centrifugal forces will divert ballistic trajectories toward the equatorial plane where material can collide with ejecta from the opposite hemisphere to form a disk ( analogous to the wind - compressed disk model of bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ) .",
    "combined , these two effects can lead to bipolar + equatorial ejection from a rotating star .",
    "there is insufficient space to present and defend the model with appropriate detail here ( and i did nt do so in my talk ) , so i ll just point the reader to smith & townsend ( 2007 ) for the details of how this may work .",
    "since this contribution does not need to pass the muster of a referee , i ll take this opportunity to go a step further and discuss a half - baked idea that i mentioned to a few people at the conference as a potential explanation for how one might get polar rings ( the equatorial ring around sn1987a is easy to explain , by comparison ) .",
    "i can think of one possibly relevant analogy of a hydrodynamic situation that leads to the formation of thin rings  an atomic bomb explosion rising in the earth s atmosphere . in footage of such explosions ( see kubrick 1964 ) , one sometimes sees a ring forming around the stem of the mushroom cloud as it rises .",
    "this is a vortical ring formed from shear between the surrounding gas and the rising hot plume in the stem of the mushroom cloud .",
    "there may be an astrophysical application of this : in a non - spherical surface explosion from a near - critically rotating star , the poles of the star will be hotter and the escape velocity ( and hence the ejecta speed ) will be faster , as noted earlier . moving from equator to pole ,",
    "then , there will be a gradient in the expansion speed and one could imagine that shear might occur at some mid - latitude during the explosion , in a manner analogous to a mushroom cloud or smoke rings .",
    "reflected around the rotation axis at mid latitudes both above and below the equator , this might lead to a pair of polar rings if the density structure is frozen - in to the expanding ejecta . testing",
    "the plausibility of this idea will require a detailed numerical simulation , of course , because currently it is little more than a suspicion of mine that someting like this might work . in any case",
    ", the rings around sn1987a and hd168625 , as well as vaguely similar structures around bipolar planetary nebulae ( e.g. , balick & frank 2002 ) , are still persistent unsolved astrophysical problems that at the same time hold critical clues to the nature of the central stars ."
