    "these parameters thus used in the sed fits do not reflect an independent parameter determination , but rather our attempt to best constrain the infrared photospheric emission .",
    "we model stars with an infrared excess as a combination of the white dwarf photosphere and an optically thick , geometrically thin disk with a temperature profile @xmath34 , with @xmath35 @xcite . the ratio of stellar radius to distance sets the absolute scale of the white dwarf photospheric flux , and is fixed in our modeling based on the best available parameters .",

    "broadly speaking , the inner disk edges are fairly well constrained by their 2.2 and 3.6@xmath16 m emission .",

    "all together , the infrared emissions are precisely that expected for dust particles resulting from the tidal destruction of a large planetary body , whose constituent elements now rain onto and pollute the surfaces of the host stars .",

    "this corresponds to a narrow ring , however , as can be seen in the  panels , the solution is degenerate with respect to inner disk temperatures above 800k , and inclination , and the outer temperature is not at all constrained .",
    "the  surfaces shown in figure[f - chi2 ] , show that a vast range in disk temperatures could provide a fit to the excess .",
    "we therefore can not confidently estimate any of the disk parameters .    _",
    "gd61_. from analysis of irac images and peak - up imaging , this object was found to have an excess in @xcite .",
    "here we include the @xmath32 data taken with liris to better constrain the stellar flux .",
    "these images resolve a nearby ( background ) source ( figure[f-0435im ] ) that almost certainly contaminates the 2mass photometry used in previous fits . from its spectral energy distribution and brightness , this object",
    "is not associated with the white dwarf . in the _ spitzer",
    "_ irac images , the psf of the white dwarf and the contaminant overlap slightly , however , the apex psf - fitting photometry cleanly separates the two objects .",
    "we can therefore confirm the presence of a disk from the irac and irs fluxes .",
    "when performing  fitting of the infrared excess , we exclude the @xmath18 m flux due to a possible increase owing to silicate emission , and therefore the disk continuum emission would be overestimated .",
    "such emission has been detected in all eight dusty white dwarfs observed spectroscopically with irs @xcite . a disk model with inner and outer - disk temperatures of @xmath50 and @xmath51k , respectively , and an inclination @xmath52 is the best fit to the excess ( figure[f - sed ] and figure[f - chi2 ] ) . the disk model temperature and inclination are again degenerate , and a large range of parameters would fit the infrared fluxes .",
    "we therefore find the values reported previously ( @xmath53k , @xmath54k and @xmath55 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not inconsistent with ours , given the uncertainties in temperature and inclination .",
    "_ he1349@xmath02305_. after deconvolving the white dwarf and neighboring , background source (  [ ss - bg ] ) , a significant infrared excess is still found over the stellar model ( figure[f - sed ] ) . the white dwarf photosphere is well constrained by short wavelength and near - infrared photometry shown in table[t - ind ] .",
    "_ wise _ @xmath56 and @xmath57 m fluxes are also available for this object , however , the nearby source seen in figure[f-1349im ] is within the _ wise _ beam width and therefore significantly contaminates the _ wise _ fluxes .",
    "we therefore do not include these fluxes in the disk modeling .",
    "the excess is best fitted with a disk having @xmath58k , @xmath59k and an inclination of @xmath52 .",
    "the uncertainties are rather modest in this case .    _",
    "nltt51844_. this was one of two white dwarfs bright enough to attempt blue peak - up image using irs .",
    "the @xmath18 m flux measurement is in excess over the white dwarf model by slightly more than @xmath19 , similar to the mips 24@xmath16 m photometric excesses detected at g238 - 44 and g180 - 57 @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer _ galaxy counts at these wavelengths are @xmath60 galaxies per square arc second @xcite for the brightness needed to produce an apparent excess in these cases . therefore the probability that such a source falls within a radius of two irs blue peak - up fwhm ( @xmath61 ) can be as high as 10percent .",
    "thus the probability that three sources have excesses at roughly 20@xmath16 m ( and not at shorter wavelengths ) due to background objects , out of 30 stars surveyed at these longer wavelengths , can be as high as 65percent .    while we can not yet rule out a chance alignment in these cases , the astrometric position of nltt51844 in the irs image mosaic coincides within @xmath62 of its position in the irac images , based on the absolute _ spitzer _ astrometry provided in the processed image files .",
    "both nltt51844 and g180 - 57 are cool , helium - rich stars where metals can be resident for myr timescales , and hence their accretion history is unconstrained . in any case ,",
    "dust that emits only at such long wavelengths must be sufficiently far from the white dwarf that it can not be the immediate source of the atmospheric metals . still , if the data for nltt51844 ( as well as g238 - 44 and g180 - 57 ) are not spurious , we may be seeing an important clue to the nature of numerous polluted white dwarfs without obvious infrared excesses .",
    "the remaining white dwarfs ( figures[f - nond0 ] and [ f - nond1 ] ) all show no evidence for infrared excess emission .",
    "they are relatively well constrained in the optical and near - infrared and therefore we can extrapolate with some certainty to irac wavelengths . below we provide notes on a few particular stars .    _",
    "this star is perhaps the most highly polluted white dwarf observed by _",
    "spitzer _ and yet does not have an infrared excess . if the analysis of @xcite is correct , this star contains @xmath63 g of metals in its atmosphere  a mass approaching that of pluto .",
    "the long diffusion timescale for heavy elements in this star allows for the possibility that a disk has been fully dissipated , but the very large mass involved suggests we are still within at most a few diffusion timescales of the accretion event .",
    "two possibilities are : 1 ) accretion is ongoing from gaseous debris , or 2 ) accretion has ended but total mass involved was at least an order of magnitude higher .",
    "it is noteworthy that this star and hs2253@xmath648023 are both highly polluted @xcite yet lack infrared excess , with he0446@xmath02531 having nearly ten times more metal mass in its convection zone .",
    "however , @xcite found that hs2253@xmath648023 has an order of magnitude less calcium than originally reported by @xcite , and therefore the same may be true of he0446@xmath02531 .    _",
    "he0449@xmath02554_. a partly - resolved extension",
    "is seen in the irac 7.9@xmath16 m image , and the combined source is offset slightly from the position of the white dwarf in the 4.5@xmath16 m image . while the sofi @xmath32 images of this star do not reveal any sources within a few arc seconds of the science target , the marginal , apparent excess seen in the sed ( figure[f - nond0 ] ) is probably caused by a background object .",
    "better data are needed to rule out contamination in irac .    _",
    "cbs127_. as mentioned above , a background object lies within a few arc seconds of the white dwarf , and could potentially contaminate moderate - size apertures used for irac photometry .",

    "the white dwarf was not detected in the 7.9@xmath16 m image , and thus a @xmath19 upper limit is given .",
    "nevertheless , all the infrared data are consistent with the predicted white dwarf photosphere .    _",
    "phl131 _ is a 40,000k white dwarf with interstellar calcium absorption , and hence not metal - rich .",
    "we do not analyze this star but its irac fluxes are reported in table[t - flu ] .",
    "of the 15 metal - polluted stars surveyed , three have an infrared excess consistent with circumstellar dust disk , and indicative of a remnant planetary system . including the objects presented here ,",
    "the total number of metal - polluted white dwarfs observed with _ spitzer _ in cycle1 through 7 is 92 .",

    "11 of 38 ( 29percent ) surveyed daz stars have circumstellar dust , whereas the same fraction for surveyed dbz - type white dwarfs is only 7 of 52 ( 13percent ) . because one would not expect disks to preferentially form around stars based on their atmospheric properties",

    "all accretion rates were calculated based on the accumulated metal abundances , using equation2 of @xcite , as performed in @xcite .",
    "one difference between the method used in @xcite and here is that in previous studies instantaneous and time - averaged accretion rates were calculated assuming the in - falling material either had solar calcium abundances ( @xmath65 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or @xmath66percent solar ( @xmath67 ; i.e. metals only ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "while the latter approach is still likely to be broadly correct , recent progress in the field enables a more accurate estimation .",
    "there are now of order 10 metal - polluted white dwarfs with measured mg , si , ca , and fe abundances @xcite , and a handful also with o abundances @xcite . based on these data ,",
    "it is increasingly clear that the accreted material has a composition similar to that of rocky , terrestrial material of the solar system .",
    "@xcite find that ca represents , on average , close to 1 part in 60 , by mass , of all the accreted heavy elements . for comparison ,",
    "this ratio is 1 part in 62.5 for the earth @xcite .",
    "based on these facts , figure[f - dmdt ] and table[t - tar ] employ accretion rates , and convective envelope masses , assuming ca is @xmath68percent ( @xmath69 ) of the total mass . to convert between the accretion rates quoted in @xcite and those shown in figure[f - dmdt ] , one must multiply by a factor of @xmath70 for daz white dwarfs and @xmath71 for dbz white dwarfs .",
    "compared to the same figures shown in previous ( related ) papers , the accretion rates for the daz white dwarfs are therefore slightly decreased , while their dbz counterparts are slightly increased .",
    "the mass of metals in the convective envelope of dbz - type white dwarfs provides a lower limit on the total mass of the destroyed parent body . from the daz stars",
    ", we can infer the instantaneous accretion rates because one can safely assume accretion - diffusion equilibrium .",

    "therefore , assuming the inferred accretion rates of daz stars represent an accurate cross section over disk lifetimes , and similarly for the observed metal masses contained within dbz stellar envelopes , we can obtain a typical disk lifetime by combining the average of these two observed quantities , i.e.    @xmath72    figure[f - mzt ] demonstrates that the mass of metals in the convective envelope of dbz white dwarfs is not a strong function of temperature , and hence cooling age .",
    "therefore , calculating the average convective envelope metal mass across cooling ages should be robust .",
    "in contrast , the convective envelope depth increases substantially in this temperature range for daz stars @xcite , as can be seen by the large increase in convective envelope metal masses at longer cooling ages in figure[f - mzt ] .    among 13 daz white dwarfs observed to have infrared excess with _ spitzer _ , the average metal accretion rate is @xmath73gs@xmath12 . among 8 dbz - type stars with dust detected by _ _",
    "spitzer__122336.5 , the dbz star from @xcite with an infrared excess , because no calcium abundances are published . ]",
    "the average metal content of the convection zone is @xmath74 g , and we thus estimate @xmath75yr .",
    "however , figure[f - dmdt ] shows that the accretion rates and convection zone metal content vary by orders of magnitude , and suggests that using the logarithmic mean and standard deviation , @xmath76(gs@xmath77\\rangle=8.8\\pm0.4 $ ] and @xmath78(g)]@xmath79 , may be a more appropriate choice .",
    "the resulting estimate for the disk lifetime is @xmath80(yr)@xmath81=5.6\\pm1.1 $ ] . because the metal masses in the dbz stars are lower limits on the total parent body masses , it is reasonable to presume the same for the disk lifetimes .",
    "at least 1percent of all white dwarfs with cooling ages less than 0.5gyr have dusty disks @xcite .",
    "assuming that all white dwarfs host ( remnants of ) planetary systems and go through intermittent phases of debris , one would expect any given star to exhibit detectable infrared excess for @xmath82yr @xmath83yr , which is broadly consistent with our estimate above .",
    "different possible scenarios for the evolution of dust disks , and corresponding estimates for their lifetimes have been discussed in more detail by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a main motivation of the work of @xcite was to explain the existence of metal - polluted white dwarfs without infrared excess detection by the continuous accretion from a gaseous disk that is replenished by the repeated tidal destruction of multiple small asteroids . in this scenario ,",
    "dust disks are associated with the disruption of massive asteroids , and @xcite estimated the lifetimes of the gaseous and dust disks to be @xmath84yr and @xmath85yr , respectively , though he underlined the uncertainty of these estimates .",
    "@xcite discussed his scenario in the context of a much smaller sample of metal - polluted white dwarfs , in which the majority of high @xmath86 stars were displaying infrared excess identifying the presence of dusty disks .",
    "it is unlikely that the much larger accretion rates that are now known for some stars without infrared excess can be explained by multiple impacts of small asteroids .",
    "@xcite showed that poynting - robertson drag can explain accretion rates of @xmath87g / s , and estimated the lifetime of massive ( @xmath88 g ) dust disks to several myr .",
    "the higher accretion rates observed in a number of white dwarfs require the presence of gas that increases the viscosity , and @xcite shows that sublimation of the inner disk may be sufficient to lead to a runaway evolution which produces accretion rates of @xmath11g / s , exhausting the disk in @xmath89yr .",
    "@xcite explicitly excluded the generation of gas by multiple impacts of additional asteroids . extending the analysis to the global evolution of the debris disks ,",
    "@xcite confirm that massive disks have expected life times of several myr if subject to poynting - robertson drag only , but that sublimation may substantially shorten these estimates .",
    "our disk lifetime estimate in the previous section is broadly compatible with all the estimates summarized above .",
    "however , our approach assumed that accretion rates do not change significantly as a function of disk age , and that the _ spitzer _ sample is representative of the potential changes in the accretion rate .",
    "@xcite suggested that accretion onto a white dwarf could proceed through three distinct phases ; a build - up , a steady state , and a decline , where the steady state lifetime should be orders of magnitude longer than the beginning and ending episodes .",
    "if correct , and disk lifetimes are typically @xmath90yr , then it will be very unlikely for an arbitrary white dwarf with circumstellar dust to be observed in anything other than a steady state phase .",
    "inspection of figure[f - dmdt ] shows , as already mentioned in  [ ss - dbz ] , that the fraction of dbz with _ spitzer _",
    "infrared excess is substantially smaller than that of daz .",
    "the detection of dust seems to be associated with a minimum accretion rate , and if we only consider white dwarfs with @xmath91 , we find that 10/21 ( 48percent ) of daz have infrared excess , compared to only 7/30 ( 23percent ) for the dbz .",
    "this difference is , however , subject to small number statistics and future observations may show that both daz and dbz are equally likely to show an infrared excess .",
    "if there is a real disparity , this fact is most likely related to the one significant difference between dbz and daz : their diffusion time scales , and allows some independent gauge of the disk lifetime .",
    "assuming a typical lifetime of the disks that is similar to or greater than the diffusion time scale of the dbz stars ( @xmath92 ) , we would expect a similar ratio of daz and dbz stars exhibiting infrared excess .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath93 , it would be very unlikely to detect the disks around any given dbz .",
    "thus , the small but non - negligible fraction of dbz with observed infrared excess leads us to conclude that the typical disk life time is somewhat shorter than the diffusion time scales in dbz    or that the disk lifetimes vary by substantial amounts ( which is in fact consistent with the large uncertainty in our logarithmic estimate of the life time ) .",
    "it appears unlikely that a large fraction of the highly polluted dbz white dwarfs without infrared excess are currently accreting from a gaseous disk , as the life times of these gaseous disks are short @xcite .",
    "figure[f - dmdt ] also reveals a fairly well defined upper limit in @xmath86 for daz white dwarfs .",
    "based on our updated calculation of the accretion rates , there are no daz white dwarfs observed with _ spitzer _ with accretion rates above @xmath94gs@xmath12 . the most extremely metal - polluted daz white dwarf star currently known , galex1931@xmath640117 @xcite , still only accretes at a rate of @xmath95gs@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are several dbz white dwarfs with metal accretion rates one to two orders of magnitude larger than observed in any daz , and substantially exceeding the rates that can be explained by poynting - robertson drag @xcite .",
    "for instance , he04462531 , he04492554 , and he1350162 all have accreted several @xmath96 g to nearly @xmath97 g within the last diffusion time scale , i.e. @xmath90yr ( or correspondingly larger amounts of material if the accretion ended several diffusion time scales ago ) .",
    "this is comparable to the extremely metal - polluted dz white dwarf , sdssj0956@xmath645912 , which has at least @xmath98 g of metals in its atmosphere@xcite . assuming the planetary bodies and physical mechanisms",
    "do not depend on the type of white dwarf , this substantial difference in the maximum accretion rates found for daz and dbz white dwarfs forces us to conclude that either the calculated metal accretion rates for dbz white dwarfs suffer from systematic errors , or the extremely high metal accretion rates found among dbz white dwarfs simply have not been seen yet in daz white dwarfs .",
    "one may speculate that both daz and dbz white dwarfs can undergo a short - lived phase of very high rate accretion . whereas the long diffusion time scales of dbz provide an efficient `` memory '' to such events , the opposite is true for the daz , where the large amount of metals would be cleared out of the atmosphere within days to at most years    reducing the probability of witnessing such an event .",
    "a number of possible scenarios that would lead to such phases are conceivable .",
    "secondary impacts of asteroids on an existing massive dust disk could generate sufficient amounts of gas to lead to runaway accretion @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a collisional cascade in the initially highly eccentric disk may generate sufficient amounts of gas to cause runaway accretion , effectively preventing the formation of a longer lived disk . in either scenario ,",
    "the perturbed debris disks are expected to evolve on relatively short timescales , and @xcite have shown that the structure of the gaseous disk in sdssj084539.17 + 225728.0 changes on timescales of a few years . an initial spike in the accretion rate",
    "could also be related to the direct accretion of a substantial fraction of the disrupted asteroid , with the possible subsequent formation of a debris disk feeding the white dwarf at a lower rate .",
    "another alternative comes from the fact that asteroid accretion events are , by definition , produced from eccentric orbits .",
    "one can therefore envisage that a fraction of disk are therefore born in an unstable configuration .",
    "the disk would , similarly to the above scenario , have many disk  disk interactions , producing a significant amount of gas",
    ". therefore the disk could accreted at a very high rate , leaving a heavily - polluted white dwarf without a dust disk .",
    "we obtained and analyzed _ spitzer _ observations of 15 white dwarfs with metal - polluted atmospheres , all but one having helium - dominated atmospheres . of these ,",
    "he0110@xmath05630 , gd61 and he1349@xmath02305 are found to have an infrared excess consistent with closely - orbiting circumstellar dust .",
    "these disks are likely formed from the disruption of large asteroid analogs within the remnant planetary systems .",
    "a marginal excess is measured at @xmath99 m around nltt51844 , but more data are needed to rule out contamination from extragalactic sources .",
    "this survey nearly doubles the number of disk detections around dbz white dwarfs . using this substantially enlarged sample",
    ", we estimate a typical disk lifetime by comparing the accreted metal masses inferred from dbz stars with dust to the instantaneous accretion rates for daz stars with dust .",
    "accounting for the large scatter by taking the logarithmic average , we find @xmath1=5.6\\pm1.1 $ ] , which is compatible with the relatively large range of disk lifetimes estimated from different theoretical models of white dwarf disks .",
    "the fraction of highly - polluted dbz white dwarfs exhibiting an infrared excess is low ( 23percent ) compared to that among daz white dwarfs ( 48percent ) . assuming that the formation and evolution of circumstellar disks is similar for both types of stars",
    ", this difference suggests that the disk life times are typically shorter than the dbz diffusion time scales .",
    "we also show that the highest time - averaged accretion rates are found among white dwarfs with helium - rich atmospheres , many of which do not exhibit infrared excess , and we suggest that these stars have experienced very high accretion rates during short - lived phases .",
    "these events should occur in hydrogen - dominated white dwarfs as well , but their short diffusion timescales substantially lower the probability of detection .",
