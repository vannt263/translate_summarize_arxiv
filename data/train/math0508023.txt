    "motion camouflage is a stealth strategy employed by various visual insects and animals to achieve prey capture , mating or territorial combat . in one type of motion camouflage ,",
    "the predator camouflages itself against a fixed background object so that the prey observes no relative motion between the predator and the fixed object . in the other type of motion camouflage ,",
    "the predator approaches the prey such that from the point of view of the prey , the predator always appears to be at the same bearing .",
    "( in this case , we say that the object against which the predator is camouflaged is the point at infinity . ) assuming that the prey can readily observe optical flow , but only poorly sense looming , this type of motion by the predator is then difficult to detect by the prey .",
    "for example , insects with compound eyes are quite sensitive to optical flow ( which arises from the transverse component of the relative velocity between the predator and the prey ) , but are far less sensitive to slight changes in the size of images ( which arise from the component of the relative velocity between the predator and prey along the line between them )",
    ". more broadly such interactions may also apply in settings of mating activity or territorial maneuvers as well . in the work , @xcite of srinivasan and davey ,",
    "it was suggested that the data on visually mediated interactions between two hoverflies , _ syritta pipiens _ obtained earlier by collett and land @xcite , supports a motion camouflage hypothesis .",
    "later , mizutani , chahl and srinivasan @xcite , observing territorial aerial maneuvers of dragonflies _ hemianax papuensis _ , concluded that the flight pattern is motivated by motion camouflage ( see figure 1 in their paper ) .",
    "see also @xcite for a review of related themes in insect vision and flight control .",
    "motion camouflage can be used by a predator to stealthily pursue prey , but a motion camouflage strategy can also be used by the prey to evade a predator .",
    "the only difference between the strategy of the predator and the strategy of the evader is that the predator seeks to approach the prey while maintaining motion camouflage , whereas the evader seeks to move away from the predator while maintaining motion camouflage . besides explaining certain biological pursuit strategies",
    ", motion camouflage may also be quite useful in certain military scenarios ( although the `` predator '' and `` prey '' labels may not be descriptive ) . in some settings , as is the case in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite it is more appropriate to substitute the labels `` shadower '' and `` shadowee '' for the predator - prey terminology .    in this work ,",
    "we take a structured approach to deriving feedback laws for motion camouflage , which incorporate biologically plausible ( vision ) sensor measurements .",
    "we model the predator and prey as point particles moving at constant ( but different ) speeds , and subject to steering ( curvature ) control .",
    "for an appropriate choice of feedback control law for one of the particles ( as the other follows a prescribed trajectory ) , a state of motion camouflage is then approached as the system evolves .",
    "( in the situation where the predator follows a motion - camouflage law , and the speed of the predator exceeds the speed of the prey , the predator is able to pass `` close '' to the prey in finite time . in practice ,",
    "once the predator is sufficiently close to the prey , it would change its strategy from a pursuit strategy to an intercept strategy . )",
    "what distinguishes this work from earlier study of motion - camouflage trajectories in @xcite is that we present _ biologically plausible feedback laws _ leading to motion camouflage .",
    "furthermore , unlike the neural - network approach used in @xcite to achieve motion camouflage using biologically - plausible sensor data , our approach gives an explicit form for the feedback law which has a straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "the study of motion camouflage problems also naturally extends earlier work on interacting systems of particles , using the language of curves and moving frames @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for concreteness , we consider the problem of motion camouflage in which the predator ( which we refer to as the `` pursuer '' ) attempts to intercept the prey ( which we refer to as the `` evader '' ) while appearing to the prey as though it is always at the same bearing ( i.e. , motion camouflaged against the point at infinity ) . in the model we consider , the pursuer moves at unit speed in the plane , while the evader moves at a constant speed @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics of the pursuer are given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the position of the pursuer , @xmath3 is the unit tangent vector to the trajectory of the pursuer , @xmath4 is the corresponding unit normal vector ( which completes a right - handed orthonormal basis with @xmath3 ) , and the plane curvature @xmath5 is the steering control for the pursuer .",
    "similarly , the dynamics of the evader are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the position of the evader , @xmath8 is the unit tangent vector to the trajectory of the evader , @xmath9 is the corresponding unit normal vector , and @xmath10 is the steering control for the evader .",
    "figure [ framefig2d ] illustrates equations ( [ pursuer2d ] ) and ( [ evader2d ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are planar natural frenet frames for the trajectories of the pursuer and evader , respectively .",
    "we model the pursuer and evader as point particles ( confined to the plane ) , and use natural frames and curvature controls to describe their motion , because this is a simple model for which we can derive both physical intuition and concrete control laws .",
    "( furthermore , although we save the details for a future paper , this approach generalizes nicely for three - dimensional motion . )",
    "flying insects and animals ( also unmanned aerial vehicles ) have limited maneuverability and must maintain sufficient airspeed to stay aloft , so treating their motion as constant - speed with steering control is physically reasonable , at least for some range of flight conditions .",
    "( note that the steering control directly drives the angular velocity of the particle , and hence is actually an acceleration input .",
    "however , this acceleration is constrained to be perpendicular to the instantaneous direction of motion , and therefore the speed remains unchanged . )",
    "we refer to ( [ pursuer2d ] ) and ( [ evader2d ] ) as the `` pursuit - evader system . '' in what follows , we assume that the pursuer follows a _ feedback _ strategy to drive the system toward a state of motion camouflage , and close in on the evader .",
    "the evader , on the other hand , follows an open - loop strategy .",
    "the analysis we present for the pursuer feedback strategy also suggests ( with a sign change in the control law ) how the evader could use feedback and a motion - camouflage strategy to conceal its flight from the pursuer . ultimately , it would be interesting to address the game - theoretic problem in which both the pursuer and evader follow feedback strategies , so that the system would truly be a pursuit - evader system .",
    "( what we address in this work would be more properly described as a pursuer - pursuee system .",
    "however , we keep the pursuer - evader terminology , because it sets the stage for analyzing the true pursuer - evader system , which we plan to address in a future paper . )",
    "motion camouflage with respect to the point at infinity is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a fixed unit vector and @xmath15 is a time - dependent scalar ( see also section 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath16 be the vector from the evader to the pursuer .",
    "we refer to @xmath17 as the `` baseline vector , '' and @xmath18 as the `` baseline length . ''",
    "we restrict attention to non - collision states , i.e. , @xmath19 . in that case",

    "we are interested in how far the pursuit - evasion system is from a state of motion camouflage . in what follows ,",
    "we offer a measure of this .",
    "consider the ratio @xmath39 which compares the rate of change of the baseline length to the absolute rate of change of the baseline vector . if the baseline experiences pure lengthening , then the ratio assumes its maximum value , @xmath40 .",
    "if the baseline experiences pure shortening , then the ratio assumes its minimum value , @xmath41 . if the baseline experiences pure rotation , but remains the same length , then @xmath42 . noting that @xmath43 we see that @xmath44 may alternatively be written as @xmath45 thus , @xmath44 is the dot product of two unit vectors : one in the direction of @xmath17 , and the other in the direction of @xmath46",
