    "gapless phases of matter have received enormous attention in recent years . in the context of unconventional superconductors ( scs ) , such gapless phases manifest as nodal excitations in superconducting gaps , and they have played important roles in determination of the pairing symmetry .",
    "recent developments on topological classification  @xcite have deepened the understanding of the nodal stability . from the topological perspective , the stability of the nodal structure is ensured by topological numbers , which predict surface zero energy andreev bound states at the same time , due to the bulk - boundary correspondence . in particular , line nodes induce surface zero energy flat bands in projected surface brillouin zone ( bz )  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the surface zero - energy flat bands results in a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in the tunneling spectroscopy  @xcite , which has been observed in high - t@xmath3 cuprates  @xcite .",
    "in addition , similar zbcps have been anticipated theoretically in time - reversal invariant ( tri ) noncentrosymmetric scs  @xcite such as cept@xmath4si  @xcite , cerh@xmath4si  @xcite , and ceirsi@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "up to this time , line node in tri scs have been considered . in tri scs",
    ", there is chiral symmetry that is obtained as a combination of particle - hole ( phs ) and time - reversal symmetries ( trs ) in most topological arguments .",
    "the chiral symmetry makes it possible to define a one - dimensional ( 1d ) winding number , which ensures the stability of line nodes and the existence of surface flat bands .",
    "however , for heavy fermion scs such as upt@xmath4  @xcite and uru@xmath5si@xmath5  @xcite , line nodes in time - reversal breaking gap functions have been also proposed .",
    "these materials are candidates of 3d chiral superconductors with @xmath6 pairing symmetry .",
    "@xmath7 corresponds to chiral d - wave pairing  ( uru@xmath5si@xmath5 ) , and @xmath8 to chiral f - wave pairing ( b - phase of upt@xmath4 ) .",

    "since the chiral scs break time - reversal symmetry , the forementioned chiral symmetry is absent .",
    "nevertheless , by using a momentum - dependent gauge symmetry , we find a momentum - dependent chiral symmetry specific to the chiral scs , which allows us to define a similar 1d winding number .",
    "this winding number explains the existence of zero energy surface flat bands on a surface normal to the @xmath11-axis .",
    "in contrast to the original chiral symmetry , the model - dependent chiral symmetry is fragile , and the surface zero energy flat bands disappear when a surface is not normal to the @xmath11-axis .",

    "the main purpose of this paper is to clarify the disappearance of zero energy flat bands and explore the interplay between surface states originating from line and point nodes in the higher order chiral scs .",
    "we also argue the parity - dependence of the stability . for odd @xmath1 ,",
    "the parity of the gap function is even , while for even @xmath1 , the parity is odd . in our previous paper  @xcite , we have uncovered that line nodes in odd - parity scs are topologically unstable , and the corresponding surface states are fragile against the surface rashba spin - orbit interaction ( rsoi ) . taking into account the rsoi in the calculation of tunneling conductance , we confirm the flat band instability in the even @xmath1 case as the suppression of the zbcp with increasing the magnitude of the rsoi .",

    "we phenomenologically model 3d chiral scs with @xmath12-wave pairing symmetry ( @xmath13 ) as a single band system described by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 here @xmath17 describes a normal dispersion with trs and @xmath18 takes @xmath19 the parity of the gap function is even ( odd ) when @xmath1 is odd ( even ) .",

    "these topological numbers are defined within lower dimensional subspaces in the bz .",
    "importantly , the 1d topological number originates from the interplay between topology and symmetry and is affected by the pseudo trs and the spin - rotation symmetry , as we shall show in the following .      to define the 1d topological number associated with a line node , we recall a winding number in tri scs ( see refs .",
    "for example ) .",

    "we define a chiral operator and an associated 1d winding number for even and odd parity cases , respectively .    in the even - parity case ,",

    "the topological surface state strongly depends on the relative angle between the line node and the surface .",
    "this is a key feature of 3d chiral scs , resulting in instability of zbcp in terms of the surface misorientation .    on the other hand , using the local gauge transformation and the spin - rotation symmetry ,",

    "[ fig : conductance3 ] ( d ) and ( f ) via the angle resolved conductance in @xmath208 . thus , the obtained results agree well with the topological arguments .",
    "hence , in even @xmath1 , the rsoi breaks the spin - rotation symmetry and leads to the flat band instability , while the suppression of the zbcp does not occur in odd @xmath1 because the pseudo trs only stabilize the flat band and is still preserved under the rsoi .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , we have discussed surface states in 3d chiral scs with @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry and found fragility of surface zero - energy flat bands against the surface misorientation and the surface rsoi .",
    "these instabilities are due to the breaking of the protecting symmetries : the pseudo trs and the spin - rotation symmetry . using the 1d winding number",
    ", we have shown that zero - energy flat bands in the 3d chiral scs are protected by the accidental chiral symmetry consisting of the pseudo trs and/or the spin - rotation symmetry .",
    "thus , the resulting flat bands are more fragile than is normally understood .",
    "we have demonstrated the suppression of the zbcp in the n / i / s junction by numerically calculating tunnel conductance , with taking into account the effect of the surface misorientation and the surface rsoi . as a result , we found the suppression of the zbcp in terms of the surface misorientation in all of 3d chiral scs ( @xmath68 ) because the pseudo trs is sensitive to the breaking of lattice symmetry . also , including the rsoi breaks the spin - rotation symmetry , resulting in the decrease of the zbcp with increase in the magnitude of the rsoi in odd - parity scs .",
    "we summarized the chiral operators discussed in this paper and the flat band instabilities in table  [ tab : sum ] , in which tri noncentrosymmetric and tri even - parity scs are included .",
    "it is noteworthy that similar flat band instabilities associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry have been also discussed in 2d systems in the disordered limit  @xcite .",
    "proximity effect of the flat bands into diffusive normal metal is also an interesting problem  @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention the implication of our results for heavy fermion compounds upt@xmath4  @xcite , uru@xmath5si@xmath5  @xcite , and srptas  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have mainly focused on trs breaking scs with @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry , assuming that the normal hamiltonian possesses trs . in the heavy fermion systems , however , the gap functions are representation of a point group and they can be more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , as long as they take the form @xmath0 near the fermi surface , our result is applicable even for heavy fermion scs . in our calculation",
    ", we do not determine the spatial dependence of the pair potential  @xcite .",
    "as far as we are considering zero energy states , the obtained results will not be changed even if the spatial depletion of the pair potential near the surface is taken into account  @xcite .",
