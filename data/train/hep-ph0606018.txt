    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has proven to hold up against any experimental tests it has been subjected to so far .",
    "the sm has several striking features for which no underlying principle has been experimentally confirmed to this date .",
    "first , the sm requires the scale of electro - weak symmetry breaking to be of order a few hundred gev , which is many orders of magnitude below the only fundamental scale of nature we know of , the planck scale .",
    "second , to explain the masses and flavor violating transitions of fermions requires the fundamental yukawa matrices to satisfy a very particular scaling , for which no satisfactory symmetry or other underlying principle has been found so far .",
    "while the scale of electro - weak symmetry breaking is known from the measured properties of gauge interactions , the scale of flavor violation could be completely unrelated to that scale .",
    "however , many models of new physics which address the electro - weak scale also give additional contributions to flavor physics . thus , precise measurements of flavor and cp violating observables can severely constrain possible models of electro - weak symmetry breaking .    since the standard model predicts the short distance couplings of quarks to one another , while experimental measurements are done with hadrons , one needs to understand long distance qcd effects on the measured quantities to extract the underlying physics .",
    "it is the purpose of this talk to discuss how this separation between long and short distance physics can be achieved using effective theories .",
    "the effective theory that is applicable to the non - leptonic @xmath0 decays to two light mesons , as we are concerned with here , is the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite .",
    "there has been tremendous progress over the last few years in understanding charmless two - body , non - leptonic @xmath0 decays in the heavy quark limit of qcd  @xcite . in this limit",
    "one can prove factorization theorems of the matrix elements describing the strong dynamics of the decay into simpler structures such as light cone distribution amplitudes of the mesons and matrix elements describing a heavy to light transition  @xcite .",
    "it is very important that these results are obtained from a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath2 .",
    "the development of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite allowed these decays to be treated in the framework of effective theories , clarifying the separation of scales in the problem , and allowing factorization to be generalized to all orders in @xmath3 .",
    "factorization for @xmath4 decays involves three distinct distance scales @xmath5 . for @xmath4",
    "decays , a factorization theorem was proposed by beneke , buchalla , neubert and sachrajda  @xcite , often referred to as the qcdf result in the literature .",
    "another proposal is a factorization formula which depends on transverse momenta , which is referred to as pqcd  @xcite .",
    "the factorization theorem derived using scet  @xcite agrees with the structure of the qcdf proposal if perturbation theory is applied at the scales @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "one of the differences is that qcdf treats @xmath8 penguins perturbatively , while in the scet analysis they are left as a perturbative contribution plus an unfactorized large @xmath9 term .",
    "the scet result improved the factorization formula by generalizing it to allow each of the scales @xmath6 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 to be discussed independently .",
    "the derivation of the scet factorization theorem occurs in several steps , corresponding to integrating out the various scales in the problem .",
    "as already mentioned , the relevant scales are @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "one starts from the effective weak hamiltonian , which describes the effects of the weak physics in terms of local 4-quark operators . integrating out @xmath15 fluctuations , the effective hamiltonian at leading order in @xcite",
    "can be written schematically as @xmath16 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are wilson coefficients , and the symbol @xmath19 denotes convolutions over various momentum fractions .",
    "gluons are nonperturbative and lo soft gluons are exchanged by the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and spectator quark which is not shown . , width=264 ]    the term @xmath23 denotes operators appearing in long distance charm effects as in fig .  [",
    "fig : cpenguin ] .",
    "there is broad agreement that charm loop contributions from hard ( @xmath24 ) momenta can be computed in perturbation theory and they are included in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ match ] ) .",
    "however , there are non - perturbative contributions from penguin charm quark loops ( so - called charming penguins  @xcite ) , which are contained in @xmath23 .",
    "while no proof of factorization for the matrix element of this operator exists , it is still possible to determine its parametric dependence on @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 using operators in effective field theories .",
    "we find @xmath28 thus , this contribution gives rise to a source of strong phases in the amplitudes , while all strong phases vanish for the other terms .",
    "for this reason , we will keep this term and treat its matrix element as an unknown complex parameter in the theory .",
    "the collinear fields in the operators @xmath29 can be decoupled from the ultrasoft fields by making a simple field redefinition  @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath29 then factor into @xmath30 and @xmath31 parts , @xmath32 the first term contains both a soft @xmath20 quark field and a collinear field in the @xmath31 direction , while the second term contains two collinear fields in the @xmath33 direction .",
    "the matrix element of the operators @xmath29 thus factor into a @xmath34 transition matrix element , and a vacuum to light meson matrix element .    putting all these results together",
    ", we obtain the scet factorization formula @xmath35 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are non - perturbative parameters describing @xmath34 transition matrix elements , and @xmath38 parameterizes complex amplitudes from charm quark contractions for which factorization has not been proven .",
    "power counting implies @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are perturbatively calculable in an expansion in @xmath42 and depend upon the process of interest .    at leading order in @xmath42 the short distance coefficients",
    "@xmath40 is independent of the parameter @xmath43 , which implies that the functional form of the non - perturbative function @xmath44 does not matter , since we can define a new hadronic parameter @xmath45 .",
    "without any theoretical input , there are 4 real hadronic parameters for each decay mode ( one complex amplitude for each ckm structure ) minus one overall strong phase . in addition , there are the weak cp violating phases that we want to determine . for @xmath46 decays",
    "there are a total of 11 hadronic parameters , while in @xmath47 decays there are 15 hadronic parameters .",
    "using isospin , the number of parameters is reduced .",
    "isospin gives one amplitude relation for both the @xmath48 and the @xmath49 system , thus eliminating 4 hadronic parameters in each system ( two complex amplitudes for each ckm structure ) .",
    "this leaves 7 hadronic parameters for @xmath46 and 11 for @xmath50 .",
    "the su(3 ) flavor symmetry relates not only the decays @xmath46 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , but also @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 decays to two light mesons .",
    "the decomposition of the amplitudes in terms of su(3 ) reduced matrix elements can be obtained from  @xcite . and",
    "20 hadronic parameters are required to describe all these decays minus 1 overall phase ( plus additional parameters for singlets and mixing to properly describe @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "of these hadronic parameters , only 15 are required to describe @xmath58 and @xmath47 decays ( 16 minus an overall phase ) .",
    "if we add @xmath59 decays then 4 more paramaters are needed ( which are solely due to electroweak penguins ) .    .",
    "number of real hadronic parameters from different expansions in qcd .",
    "the first column shows the number of theory inputs with no approximations , while the next columns show the number of parameters using only su(2 ) , using only su(3 ) , using su(2 ) and scet , and using su(3 ) with scet . for the cases with two numbers , @xmath60 , the second follows from the first after neglecting the small penguin coefficients , ie setting @xmath61 . in su(2 ) + scet @xmath62 has 6 parameters , but 1 appears already in @xmath63 , hence the @xmath64 .",
    "the notation is analogous for the @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "[ table_parameters ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ example_table_2col ]     and @xmath47 decays , with @xmath67 .",
    "the 8 pieces of data in red ( below the dashed line ) have been used to determine the scet hadronic parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 as described in the text .",
    "the data above the line are predictions .",
    "the cp asymmetry in @xmath71 is expected to be small , but its numerical value is not predicted reliably .",
    "[ fig2],width=321 ]    experimentally , one finds @xmath72 and these results are consistent with zero .",
    "the scet predictions are considerably more precise than the current measurements , and using conservative ranges @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77,and all phase differences @xmath78 one finds @xmath79 and for the cp - sum rule @xmath80 experimental deviations that are larger than these would be a signal for new physics .      from table  [ table_parameters ] and eq .",
    "( [ params ] ) we can see that a total of 12 hadronic parameters are required to describe the decays @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath59 at leading order in scet . on top of that , there is one weak phase @xmath81 which we will take as an unknown parameter .",
    "however , in both the decays @xmath47 and @xmath82 , the coefficients multiplying the @xmath83 transition matrix elements @xmath84 and @xmath85 are very small , which implies that the observables are insensitive to the numerical value of these hadronic matrix elements .",
    "this eliminates three of the hadronic parameters , namely @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "finally , if we take the inverse moments of pion and kaon wave functions as experimental input , we obtain one additional relation between hadronic parameters .",
    "this leaves us with a total of 7 hadronic parameters as well as one weak phase .",
    "the 8 measurements used to fix these parameters are the branching ratios for @xmath0 decays to @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , as well as the cp asymmetries @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "using the hadronic parameters extracted from the @xmath46 decays ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , the value for @xmath97 determined from the decays @xmath98 and @xmath99 decays and independently varying @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we can calculate all the remaining currently measured @xmath102 observables .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the data used in the fit are shown in red below the dashed dividing line while those above the line are predictions .",
    "note that there is one more piece of data below the line than there are hadronic parameters .",
    "this additional experimental information was used to determine the value @xmath103 .",
    "we see that @xmath67 gives a good match to the @xmath104 data except for the asymmetry @xmath105 . when taking into account the theoretical error the most striking disagreements are the @xmath106 at @xmath107 and the cp - asymmetry @xmath108 at @xmath109 .",
    "all other predictions agree within the uncertainties .",
    "note that one could demand that @xmath108 be reproduced , which would imply a negative value of @xmath85 ( a naive fit for @xmath103 gives @xmath110 ) .",
    "note however , that this would imply that both perturbation theory at the intermediate scale @xmath111 and su(3 ) are badly broken .",
    "the above analysis has recently been repeated to include decays to iso - singlet final states  @xcite .",
    "this requires adding additional contributions which arise from purely gluonic configurations .",
    "it turns out that the additional operators do not change the form of the factorization theorem given in eq .",
    "( [ a0newfact ] ) , but the hadronic parameters @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 receive order one contributions from these additional operators . to add isosinglet mesons to the phenomenological analysis thus requires a second set of parameters @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , which have to be determined from data separately .",
    "since experimentally there are not enough decays available , su(3 ) flavor symmetry is required to retain predictive power . at the present time , there are two solutions possible for the gluonic hadronic parameters , and the degeneracy can only be lifted with further data .",
    "the results of the global fit , as taken from  @xcite , are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "in this talk i have discussed how one can separate the long distance non - perturbative physics from the underlying short distance physics using the soft - colinear effective theory .",
    "one finds that the number of hadronic parameters is significantly reduced , such that they can be extracted directly from a subset of the data , and then used to make predictions for the remaining data .",
    "i have given a brief discussion of the factorization theorem as it emerges from scet , and then discussed three phenomenological applications .",
    "first , i gave a detailed counting of the hadronic parameters using various theoretical approaches , then i discussed a few impacts of the fact that there is only one source of strong phases in the decay amplitudes , and finally , i showed results for global analyses of @xmath0 decays to two pseudoscalar mesons , with and without including isosinglet mesons .",
