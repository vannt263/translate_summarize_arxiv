    "galaxies consist of two major ingredients , namely , the baryonic and dark matter .",
    "there are pieces of observational evidence that properties and evolution of the baryonic component are not independent of those of the dark matter , but are closely correlated . for instance , early / late type galaxies dominate the bright / faint part of the galaxy luminosity function , which suggests that the star formation history and/or morphology are related to the total mass of the system , provided that the luminosity is basically proportional to the total mass .",
    "another example is the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ; postman & geller 1984 ) , which may indicate the possible influence of the mass of hosting halo on the galaxy formation on group / cluster scale as well .",
    "it follows from these pieces of evidence that the mass of the hosting halo could be one of the most fundamental quantities in the galaxy formation .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the galaxy formation , the evolution of baryonic and dark matter should not be treated as independent processes but should be investigated in a unified way .",
    "the baryonic contents ( stars and gas ) of galaxies have been well studied by both photometric and spectroscopic observations and have been extensively analyzed with a help of well developed theoretical tools such as stellar population synthesis models ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot 2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dark matter component of hosting halos has been less studied observationally due to the technical difficulties in probing it since it requires dynamical tracers or gravitational lensing .",
    "theoretical models for the evolution of dark matter , however , have been well developed with numerical simulations and analytical models such as press - schechter prescriptions ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "it has been known that a large - scale clustering amplitude of galaxies provides a unique way of estimating their hosting halo mass in a statistical manner .",
    "this makes use of a finding from theoretical studies of dark - matter structure formation in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model that a clustering amplitude of dark matter haloes depends monotonically and strongly on the halo mass ( mo & white 1996 ) . by measuring the clustering amplitude of galaxy populations selected from a wide - field survey",
    ", we can relate properties of the populations such as stellar mass and/or star formation rate with the mass of their hosting halo ( e.g. , giavalisco & dickinson 2001 ; adelberger et al .",
    "it , in turn , enables us to explore an ancestor  descendant connection of different galaxy populations at various redshifts from the viewpoints of both the star formation and the dark matter assembly ( moustakas & somerville 2002 ; hamana et al .",
    "2004 ; ouchi et al 2004b ) .",
    "this approach is exactly the one we take , in what follows , to explore the evolution of the old passively - evolving galaxies ( opegs ) at @xmath1 and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath2 .",
    "the opegs are selected by optical colour criteria ( see  [ sec : data - opeg ] ) being consistent with a passively evolving galaxy with the major star - formation epoch at @xmath6 .",
    "since the age of the universe at @xmath7 is only @xmath8gyrs , progenitors of the opegs must have experienced an active star formation phase at some high redshifts of @xmath9 .",
    "the lbgs , which are in general actively star forming galaxies at high redshifts , are naturally a strong candidate of a major population of the progenitor of such opegs . while there is a fraction of dusty star - forming galaxies or red old galaxies with little star formation , which are not selected by the lbg criteria at @xmath1022.5 ( e.g. , franx et al .",
    "2003 ; reddy et al .",
    "2005 ) , lbgs are still most populous among them . in addition , the opegs are considered as strong candidates for progenitors of the present - day early - type galaxies since the simple passive evolution in their stellar populations can easily link between them .",
    "we examine relations between the two galaxy populations in terms of the evolution of hosting dark matter haloes .",
    "our primary question addressed in this paper is _",
    "`` supposing the lbgs are a major progenitor of the opegs , are their hosting halo masses compatible with the mass evolution of dark matter haloes in the cdm structure formation model ? '' _ also , we discuss possible present - day descendants of those high-@xmath0 galaxies from the viewpoint of the masses of hosting haloes .",
    "we determine the clustering amplitude at large scales with angular two - point correlation functions of the opegs and lbgs measured , with a good accuracy , from a wide field ( 1 deg@xmath3 ) deep imaging data - set of subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) .",
    "multi - band colour selection techniques successfully isolate those galaxies with well calibrated redshift selection functions , which enable us to compute an accurate prediction for the corresponding dark matter angular correlation function via the limber s projection .",
    "this large data - set and selection techniques allow us to compute a large - scale galaxy bias in a robust manner . comparing the measured large - scale bias with the ones predicted by the halo model , we place a limit on the hosting halo mass of galaxy populations . here",
    "we adopt an empirically parameterized model for the halo occupation function ( hof ) which describes statistical relations between galaxies and their hosting haloes . then , utilizing the extended press - schechter ( eps ) prescriptions , we examine the evolution of halo mass in the framework of the cdm model . in this way",

    "indeed , the galaxy sample selected with @xmath147 results in a very compatible halo mass with the @xmath39 of the opegs ( with @xmath109 ) as shown in figure [ fig : eps - lbg26 ] . therefore , in the view of the mass evolution of hosting haloes , it may be safely concluded that the bright ( @xmath5 ) lbgs are consistent with being the progenitor of the opegs , whereas it seems less likely that the lbgs population , as a whole , has evolved into the opeg population .",
    "note that the corresponding number density is computed to be @xmath148mpc@xmath77 , closer to the number density of @xmath149      turn next to predictions for the present - day descendants of the two galaxy populations plotted in figures [ fig : eps - lbg][fig : eps - opeg ] .",
    "as is shown in the inserts of figures [ fig : eps - lbg ] and [ fig : eps - lbg26 ] , the pdf of the present - day descendants of the lbgs have a very broad spread due to the wide variety of the mass assembly history over @xmath150gyrs .",
    "the predicted mass range for the lbg sample with @xmath141 is broadly consistent with that of the opegs , though the pdf of the lbgs extends to a smaller mass ( say @xmath151 ) where the pdf of the opegs has little probability . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted mass range for the lbg sample with @xmath152 agrees better with that of the opeg descendants . in this case , both the pdfs computed from the central @xmath39 value ( the middle one of the three cases in the inserts ) peak at @xmath153 , which corresponds to the mass scale of groups of galaxies .",
    "it is important to note that since the pdfs are skewed strongly toward a larger mass , a certain fraction of haloes is expected to evolved into more massive haloes with @xmath154 ( see the inserts of figures [ fig : eps - lbg26 ] and [ fig : eps - opeg ] ) .",
    "= 8.4 cm    it is interesting to compare those eps predictions for the halo masses of the present - day descendants with local galaxy samples . since both the lbgs and opegs are frequently argued as the strong candidates for the progenitor of the present - day early - type galaxies , we take two clustering analyses of the early - type galaxy samples : one from the the 2df ( madgwick et al . 2003 ) , and the other from the sdss ( zehavi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "madgwick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found @xmath155 for `` passive '' galaxies , of which the luminosity range is @xmath156 with @xmath157 . here",
    "@xmath158 is the rms of counts of galaxies in spheres of @xmath159mpc radius and is derived from the best - fitting power - law model of the real - space correlation function @xmath160 via the relation @xmath161 with @xmath162 $ ] ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "since @xmath158 of the dark matter is @xmath163 at @xmath164 ( the mean redshift of the galaxy samples considered here ) for @xmath17 ( note that @xmath165 is the linearly extrapolated value at @xmath145 ) , the corresponding bias is found to be @xmath166 .",
    "following the same procedure , we estimate @xmath158 of galaxy samples from the sdss . adopting the best - fitting power - law models given in table 2 of zehavi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we find @xmath167 for their both `` red '' ( defined by @xmath168 ) and `` high concentration '' ( @xmath169 ) samples , giving @xmath170 for @xmath164 ( the mean redshift of the samples ) .",
    "the luminosity range of those galaxies is @xmath171 with @xmath172 . comparing those bias values ( i.e. , @xmath173 ) with the halo model predictions plotted in figure[fig : z0.1 ]",
    ", we find @xmath174 for @xmath175 ( note that as is shown figure[fig : z0.1 ] , the relation between the large - scale bias and @xmath176 only weakly depends on @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the eps predictions for the descendants of the opegs ( with @xmath109 ) and also with that of the lbgs ( with @xmath152 ) .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that , in the viewpoint of the mass evolution of hosting haloes in the cdm model , the opegs and the bright lbgs are consistent with being the progenitor of the present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "we have analyzed the two photometrically - selected galaxy samples from the deep mult - band images of the sxds : the lbgs at @xmath2 and opegs at @xmath1 .",
    "the contiguous large survey area of the sxds enables us to measure the angular two - point correlation functions over a wide range of separations with a good statistical quality . comparing the large - scale clustering amplitude with the corresponding halo model predictions , we have estimated a characteristic mass of hosting haloes .",
    "then , adopting the eps model , we have computed the predictions for the mass evolution of the hosting haloes to explore the likely descendants of those galaxy samples . in particular , we have compared the predicted halo masses of these two populations at different epochs to make a possible evolutionary link .",
    "we have also examined expected halo masses of the present - day descendants of those two galaxy populations .",
    "our major findings are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the measured bias functions ( defined by equation [ eq : bias_g ] ) of both the opegs and lbgs consist of two parts : the decreasing small - scale part and the flat large - scale part .",
    "the transition scales between them are 1 and 10 for the opegs and lbgs , respectively .",
    "those scales agree well with the virial radii of haloes with the characteristic mass of hosting haloes predicted by the halo model analysis in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the shape of the bias function is thus understood by the standard halo model picture : the small - scale clustering arises from galaxy pairs located in the same halo , and the large - scale clustering arises from galaxy pairs located in two different haloes .",
    "2 .   the conclusive measurement of the flat large - scale bias allows us to safely define the large - scale bias factor .",
    "also , the large number of galaxies allows us to examine the luminosity dependence of the large - scale bias factor .",
    "it is found that the large - scale bias factors of both opegs and lbgs positively correlates with the luminosity ( see bottom panels of figures [ fig : bl - opeg ] and [ fig : bl - lbg ] ) .",
    "3 .   comparing the measured large - scale bias factors of the two galaxy samples with the halo model predictions , we estimate the characteristic mass of hosting haloes . the merit of using the large - scale bias factor is two - fold :",
    "first is concerning the measurement ; since many bins are used to compute it , the measurement is less sensitive to a statistical noise in each bin .",
    "second is concerning the halo model ; the large - scale bias does not depend on @xmath29 , and in addition , the resultant @xmath176 is less sensitive to @xmath30 .",
    "therefore it provides with a reliable estimate of @xmath176 .",
    "the predicted characteristic halo masses of both galaxy samples are found to be positively correlated with the luminosity .",
    "for the opegs , this may arise from a correlation between the stellar mass and the hosting halo mass , because the observed @xmath60-band magnitude ( rest - frame @xmath57-band ) is well correlated to the stellar mass for population like opegs with little star formation activity .",
    "on the other hand , for the lbgs , it may suggest a correlation between the hosting halo mass and the star formation activity , rather than the stellar mass .",
    "this is because the observed @xmath59-band corresponds to @xmath891500 in the rest - frame , where the luminosity is most sensitive to the star formation , and in addition , the lbgs are generally in an active star formation phase .",
    "4 .   utilizing the eps model , we compute the predictions for the halo mass distribution of the lbgs descendants at @xmath81 in the cdm cosmology , and then we compare it with the halo model prediction for the characteristic halo mass of the opegs .",
    "it is found that , for our fiducial subsamples ( the opegs with @xmath109 and the lbgs with @xmath141 ) , the typical hosting halo mass of lbgs descendants is slightly smaller than the predicted mass of the opegs hosting haloes .",
    "it is also found that the brighter lbg subsample ( with @xmath177 ) is likely to evolve into the systems with halo mass compatible to the predicted one of the opegs .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that , in the viewpoint of the mass evolution of hosting haloes in the framework of the cdm model , the bright ( @xmath5 ) lbgs are consistent with being the progenitor of the opegs .",
    "accordingly , it seems less likely that the lbgs population , as a whole , has evolved into the opeg population .",
    "we also compute predictions for halo masses of the present - day descendants of both the galaxy samples using the eps model .",
    "it is found that the predicted mass range for the lbg sample with @xmath141 is slightly but systematically smaller than that of the opegs ( with @xmath109 ) . on the other hand , the prediction for the lbg sample with @xmath152 agrees better with that of the opeg descendants . in the latter case ,",
    "the peaks of the pdfs are located at @xmath153 and the tail of the pdfs extends to the mass range of @xmath178 .",
    "thus the present - day descendants of the bright lbgs and the opegs are likely to be located in massive systems such like groups of galaxies or clusters of galaxies .",
    "we also estimate the characteristic halo mass of local early - type galaxy samples from the 2df and sdss with the halo model , and it turns out that the predicted mass is in good agreement with the eps predictions for the present - day descendant s mass of both the bright lbgs and opegs .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that , in the viewpoint of the mass evolution of hosting haloes in the cdm model , the opegs and bright lbgs are consistent with being the progenitor of the present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "one of the most interesting implications from the above findings is that the possible halo mass dependence of the lbg s star formation history .",
    "this is speculated from the above finding ( iv ) that the predicted descendant s halo mass of bright lbg subsample ( @xmath5 ) is found to be in very good agreement with the characteristic halo mass of the opegs , whereas it seems less likely that the faint lbg population has evolved into the opeg population .",
    "the nature of the descendants of the faint lbgs at @xmath179 is not clear but is naively expected that they evolve into other populations than old passively evolving galaxies with lower mass and bluer spectra .",
    "it is important to notice that a little star formation at @xmath180 would be enough to push the galaxy colour outside of the opeg s colour criteria ( yamada et al .",
    "therefore , the halo mass dependence of the epoch of truncation in star formation activity is one possibility of interpreting the finding ( iv ) .",
    "it is also found that the uv luminosity of the lbgs correlates with the hosting halo mass [ the above finding ( iii ) ] .",
    "this may be an additional evidence for the mass dependent star formation history , though a connection between the above two findings , ( iii ) and ( iv ) , is not clear .",
    "a possible scenario is that lbgs in more massive haloes have more active star formation at significantly high redshift such as @xmath181 , and they turn into the passive evolution phase earlier .",
    "this scenario can be tested by performing the same clustering analysis as presented in this paper progressively toward lower ( and higher ) redshifts .",
    "we might be able to see the transition at some point where star formation activities in massive haloes are truncated and the mass of the haloes that are hosting active star formation is being shifted to lower mass as time progresses . at the same time , on the theoretical side , we should explore a possible physical mechanism that drives such mass dependent star formation histories .    before closing",
    ", it is important to note that we have _ not _ argued that lbgs are the only path to become opegs at @xmath81 or the present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "in fact , it is likely that the ancestor ",
    "descendant connection is not a one - to - one correspondence , and some different high-@xmath0 galaxy populations may have evolved into a similar low-@xmath0 population , and vice versa . for example , among the ancestors of the opegs at @xmath81 , there may be some haloes which have not collpased by @xmath124 and would be seen as lbgs at some later epochs , as well as the objects which are not uv luminous enough to be selected as lbgs at @xmath124 due to large amount of dust extinction and/or older stellar ages .",
    "this is one reason why we have not take into account the number density of our galaxy samples when we examine their possible connection .",
    "we note , however , the number density of the bright lbgs @xmath182mpc@xmath77 is in fact comparable to that of opegs @xmath183mpc@xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we could even argue from this comparison that the bright lbg ",
    "opeg connection could be the major ancestor  descendant relation _ if _ the number density of bright lbgs would not decrease significantly by mergers .",
