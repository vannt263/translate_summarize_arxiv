    "it was shown in @xcite that coalgebra objects ( in that sense ) with respect to a tw - comonad are the same as algebra objects ( in the analogous sense ) with respect to the corresponding tw - monad , and that the category of these is equivalent to a new variety of algebras ( in the sense of this paper ) , obtained by adjoining to @xmath0 additional unary operations , corresponding to the elements of any generating set ( as an algebra ) for the representing coalgebra , and appropriate identities .",
