    "physical , chemical , and biological systems are investigated in many laboratories using single molecule spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the distribution of the number of photons emitted from a single molecule source is the topic of extensive theoretical research e.g. @xcite and @xcite for a review . since optical properties of single molecules",
    "are usually very sensitive to dynamics and statics of their environment , and since the technique removes the many particle averaging found in conventional measurement techniques , single molecule spectroscopy reveals interesting fluctuation phenomena .",
    "an important mechanism responsible for the fluctuations in the number of photons emitted from a single molecule source is spectral diffusion e.g. @xcite . in many cases the absorption frequency of the molecule",
    "will randomly change due to different types of interactions between the molecule and its environment ( e.g. @xcite and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "for example for single molecules embedded in low temperature glasses , flipping two level systems embedded in the glassy environment , induce stochastic spectral jumps in the absorption frequency of the single molecule under investigation @xcite . in this way",
    "the molecule may come in and out of resonance with the continuous wave laser field with which it is interacting .",
    "obviously a second mechanism responsible for fluctuations of photon counts is the quantum behavior of the spontaneous emission process @xcite . in his fundamental work mandel",
    "@xcite showed that a single atom in the process of resonance fluorescence , _ in the absence of spectral diffusion _",
    ", exhibits sub - poissonian photon statistics @xcite .",
    "photon statistics is characterized by mandel s @xmath0 parameter @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of emitted photons within a certain time interval .",
    "the case @xmath3 is called sub - poissonian behavior , while @xmath4 is called super - poissonian .",
    "sub - poissonian statistics has no classical analog @xcite .",
    "briefly , the effect is related to anti - bunching of photons emitted from a single source and to rabi - oscillations of the excited state population which favors an emission process with some periodicity in time ( see details below ) .",
    "sub - poissonian photon statistics and photon anti - bunching were measured in several single molecule , and single quantum dots experiments @xcite . while sub - poissonian statistics is well understood in the context of resonance fluorescence of an isolated electronic transition of a simple atom in the gas phase , our theoretical understanding of sub - poissonian statistics for a molecule embedded in a fluctuating condensed phase environment is still in its infant stages .    in this paper",
    "we obtain an exact analytical expression for the @xmath0 parameter in the long time limit , for a single molecule undergoing a stochastic spectral diffusion process . to obtain the exact solution we use the zheng - brown generating function method for single molecule photon statistics @xcite . for the spectral diffusion we use a simple stochastic approach , in the spirit of the kubo ",
    "andersen line shape theory @xcite .",
    "the model exhibits generic behaviors of line shapes of molecules embedded in a condensed phase environment , e.g. motional narrowing when the stochastic fluctuations are fast , power broadening etc .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 parameter exhibits rich types of behaviors , in particular it reveals the quantum nature of the emission process in the sub - poissonian regime , while the corresponding model line - shape exhibits a classical behavior",
    ". a brief summary of our results was recently published @xcite .",
    "our analytical expressions for @xmath0 classify the transitions between sub and super poissonian statistics .",
    "they give the conditions on the spectral diffusion time scale for sub - poissonian behavior .",
    "motional narrowing type of effect is revealed also for the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "our exact result is valid for weak and strong excitation ( i.e arbitrary rabi frequency ) .",
    "it yields the lower bound on @xmath0 .",
    "the solution shows how we may choose the rabi frequency so that the quantum nature of the photon emission process becomes larger , namely how to minimize @xmath0 in the sub - poissonian regime .",
    "this is important for the efficient detection of quantum effects in single molecule spectroscopy , since choosing too small or too large values of the rabi frequency results in very small and hence undetectable values of @xmath0 .",
    "finally our exact result is used to test the domain of validity of the generalized wiener khintchine which yields @xmath0 in terms of a fourier transform of a three time dipole correlation ( as well known the wiener khintchine theorem yields the line shape in terms of a one time dipole correlation function ) .",
    "the theorem @xcite is based on the semi - classical theory of interaction of light with matter , and on linear response theory ( i.e. , weak rabi frequency ) , it yields @xmath4 . as pointed out in @xcite",
    "such a behavior is expected to be valid only for slow enough spectral diffusion processes .",
    "we briefly explain some of the main ideas of sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "the general idea is that the photons emitted from a single particle , e.g. a molecule , a nano - crystal or atom are correlated in time .",
    "consider first a hypothetical molecule , interacting with an exciting laser field , which emits photons with a constant time interval @xmath5 between successive emission events .",
    "then @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and hence @xmath8 .",
    "due to quantum uncertainty the photon emission process is always random and therefore @xmath9 .",
    "sub - poissonian behavior where @xmath10 implies that the stream of photons emitted from a single source maintain correlations in their arrival times to a detector .",
    "usually when many molecules interact with a continuous wave laser the emission events are not correlated , and the fluorescence exhibits poissonian statistics @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast a single molecule , once it emits a photon , is collapsed to its ground state .",
    "hence immediately after an emission event the molecule can not emit a second time ( it has to be re - excited by the laser ) .",
    "hence successive photons emitted from a single molecule , seem to repel each other on the time axis , a non - poissonian behavior .",
    "this well known effect is called anti - bunching @xcite which is related to sub - poissonian statistics .    a second effect related to sub - poissonian behavior are rabi - oscillations .",
    "consider a simple atom in the process of resonance fluorescence .",
    "when the electronic transition ( frequency @xmath12 ) is in resonance with a continuous wave laser field ( frequency @xmath13 ) the electronic transition can be approximated by a two level system .",
    "first let us mentally switch off the spontaneous emission , i.e. set the inverse life time of the transition @xmath14 . for zero detuning @xmath15 the transition will exhibit well known rabi oscillations : the population of the excited state will behave like @xmath16 . since the population in the excited state attains its maximum ( minimum ) periodically , also",
    "the emission times of successive photons maintain certain degree of periodicity in time , which implies sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "mandel showed @xcite , that for a two level atom in the process of resonance fluorescence @xmath17 when @xmath18 we have @xmath19 since then successive photon emission times are not correlated , because the time between successive emissions becomes very large .",
    "while when @xmath20 the excited state is populated swiftly , and only the finite spontaneous emission rate delays the emission , hence @xmath19 also in this case .",
    "( [ eqmold ] ) the lower bound @xmath21 is easily obtained , and the minimum @xmath22 is obtained when @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the random number of photons emitted by a single molecule source in a time interval @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the probability of @xmath2 emission events .",

    "single molecule theories should be able to predict the turn - over behavior of @xmath228 based on different models , since such a behavior is not expected to be limited to the model under investigation .",
    "of - course the exact solution presented in this manuscript is very valuable in this direction , since it predicts precisely the details of this transition for the kubo - anderson stochastic process .    it would be interesting to investigate further how general are our results .",
    "from line shape theory , we know that in the fast modulation limit , line shapes have lorentzian shapes under very general conditions . from experiment",
    "we know that motional narrowing effect , and lorentzian behavior of lines is wide spread .",
    "thus at - least in this limit certain general features of line shapes , which are not sensitive to model assumptions are found .",
