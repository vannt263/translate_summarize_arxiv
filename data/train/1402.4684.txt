    "quantum coherence , or quantum superposition , is one of the most fundamental features of quantum world that are distinguished from the classical one .",
    "associated with the tensor structure of the composite system , it directly leads to the formation of quantum entanglement which is usually treated as another key quantum mechanical feature and is so important that it has been recognized to be an important physical resource in quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "however , quantum coherence is only a necessary condition for the entanglement . in order to get a good understand of quantum entanglement , most including ourselves have been making efforts [ 1 - 13 ] to find out how to tell whether a state is entangled or not , or to what degree a given state is entangled , and to reveal the properties of entanglement measure of different types . here",
    "we would like to ask the first question : how entanglement is related to quantum coherence ?",
    "quantum entanglement is so familiar to us that it could be the first candidate when quantum correlation is mentioned .",
    "however , quantum entanglement does not cover all the quantumness of correlations .",
    "it has been shown that quantum discord can effectively quantify the quantum correlation [ 14 - 17 ] .",
    "it has been shown to have some similar properties to quantum entanglement , such as demonstrating the quantum advantage in some qip , but it is beyond quantum entanglement because it can be present even in separable mixed states [ 18 ] . in the past few years , quantum discord has attracted many interests in the various fields [ 19 - 30 ] , but the understanding of quantum discord remains limited .",
    "for example , the original quantum discord is an information - theoretic one that is only analytically calculated for some special states [ 26,27 ] , even though the geometric quantum discord has the analytic expression for all two - qubit states [ 31 ] ; quantum discord is not symmetric if we exchange the two subsystems of the measured quantum state , which even shows completely opposite behavior ; in particular , quantum discords in terms of different definitions are not consistent with each other for the ordering of some quantum states [ 20 ] . recently",
    ", several attempts on the operational interpretation of quantum discord have been given to the information theoretic quantum discord which is related to the quantum state merging [ 32,33 ] and the relative - entropy - based quantum discord which is connected with distillable entanglement [ 34 ] .",
    "thus we come up with the second natural question : how can we understand the geometric quantum discord from the most fundamental quantum mechanical featurequantum coherence ?    in this paper , we will answer the above two questions by studying the relation between geometric quantum discord , quantum entanglement and quantum coherence .",
    "we classify the quantum coherence into three classes based on some particular approaches , whilst some measure can be naturally given to the quantum coherence of different classes .",
    "we find that geometric quantum discord of each possible type ( including the symmetric and asymmetric version ) is just consistent with a special class of quantum coherence , which serves as the answer to our second question .",
    "we also suggest a new measure for the total quantum coherence .",
    "it can serve as a symmetric geometric quantum correlation and can be analytically calculated for the systems of two quits . in particular , the new symmetric quantum correlation for pure states is equivalent to the squared concurrence .",
    "associated with the coherence of the subsystems , we find an interesting monogamy equation that shows how quantum coherence is distributed or how entanglement is generated similar to 3-tangle introduced in ref . [ 35 ] .",
    "in addition , we quantify the third class of quantum coherence and find that for the systems of two qubits , this class of quantum coherence measure is directly connected with some quantum nonlocality , i.e. , the violation of clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality [ 36 ] .",
    "thus for the system of two qubits , not only quantum entanglement and quantum discord but also quantum nonlocality in terms of chsh inequality can be understood in the fundamental framequantum coherence .",
    "our main results are listed in detail in sec .",
    "ii which is organized as follows .",
    "we first divide quantum coherence into three class , then we prove each kind of geometric quantum discord is consistent with a kind of quantum coherence , and then we show that our suggesting measure for the total coherence can serve as a symmetric quantum correlation measure , prove its equivalence to the squared coherence for pure states and show how it is related to the distribution of quantum coherence . by using this distribution property",
    ", we also use a constructive way to show the analytic quantum discord for pure states .",
    "finally , we find out that the third class of quantum coherence can be related with the violation of chsh inequality for bipartite states of qubits .",
    "quantum coherence arises from quantum superposition , which is a necessary condition for quantum correlations . generally speaking",
    ", a good definition of quantum coherence does not only depend on the state of the system @xmath0 , but also depend on the alternatives under consideration which are usually attached to different eigenvalues of an observable @xmath1 .",
    "since the off - diagonal elements of @xmath0 characterize interference , they are usually called _ coherences _ with respect to the basis in which @xmath0 is written [ 37,38 ] . the measurements on the observables that do not commute with @xmath1 can reveal the interference . based on different viewpoints , a lot of quantum coherence measure can be defined with respect to the basis [ 39,40 ] . here we will present a new coherence measure by which we can classify the coherence .     is connected with the violation of chsh inequality , which is only satisfied by two qubits.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in order to explicitly present our classification of quantum coherence and the corresponding measure , we consider an @xmath2 density matrix @xmath3with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and tr@xmath6 .",
    "as mentioned in our previous paper [ 41 ] , the coherence can be measured by the contribution of the off - diagonal entries of @xmath0 .",
    "although it provided an explicit geometric meaning of coherence in a given basis , it is obviously basis - vector ( local basis - vector included ) dependent .",
    "however , is the characteristics of the off - diagonal entries in the coherence measure the same ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "now let us consider a scheme of local operations and classical communication .",
    "suppose alice and bob share a quantum state @xmath0 given in eq .",
    "if alice performs von neumann measurement on her qubit in terms of the same basis of @xmath0 and then informs bob her measurement outcomes , bob can obtain all the exact information about the off - diagonal entries of @xmath0 that are related to his reduced density matrix at least in theory ( for example , based on his local quantum state tomography [ 42,43 ] ) .",
    "the other off - diagonal entries of @xmath0 can not be attainable .",
    "so these unattainable off - diagonal entries can be regarded as class @xmath7 . on the contrary , if bob performs von neumann measurements on his qubit first , there will also exist some entries that alice can not attain .",
    "these alice s unattainable entries can be regarded as class @xmath8 .",
    "it is obvious that class @xmath7 and class @xmath8 have an overlap , which corresponds to the the off - diagonal entries along the anti - diagonal line of @xmath0 .",
    "the entries in the overlap can not be attained by either alice or bob .",
    "we call the overlap as class @xmath9 . thus from the point of view of coherence",
    ", we have classified the quantum coherence into three classes .",
    "why do we classify the quantum coherence with such a scheme ?",
    "one can also understand it in a physical way .",
    "when one subsystem of @xmath0 undergoes any a quantum channel [ 44 ] , one can find that the entries in class @xmath10 , @xmath11 have different decoherence rates from the rest , while the decoherence of the entries in class @xmath9 will happen if either subsystem undergoes a quantum channel .",
    "these can be shown for two qubits more obviously under the phase - damping channel ( pure decoherence [ 45 ] ) .",
    "this classification is something like the classification of tripartite mixed - state entanglement [ 46 ] , where the different classes have overlaps .      now in order to measure the degree of quantum coherence , we introduce quantum coherence measures for each class . for a given @xmath12-dimensional @xmath0 with different bases considered , i.e. @xmath13 . in order to collect the contributions of bob s unattainable off - diagonal entries ( class @xmath7 ) from @xmath14",
    ", we can select the entries as @xmath15where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the computational basis of the subsystem a and b , respectively . so the contribution to quantum coherence in the sense of squared @xmath20 norm of matrix @xmath21 $ ] is given by@xmath22}(\\rho ) = \\sum\\limits_{k^{\\prime } , l^{\\prime } , \\left ( k\\neq l\\right ) } \\left\\vert \\delta _ { kk^{\\prime } , ll^{\\prime } } \\right\\vert ^{2}.\\]]thus alice and bob can select a proper frame ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) such that @xmath25}(\\rho ) $ ] can be minimized after their operations .",
    "similarly , for the coherence in class @xmath8 , we have @xmath26}(\\rho ) $ ] can be given by @xmath27}(\\rho ) = \\sum\\limits_{k^{\\prime } \\neq l^{\\prime } , k , l}\\left\\vert",
    "\\delta _ { kk^{\\prime } , ll^{\\prime } } \\right\\vert ^{2},\\]]in this way , we have the following definition .",

    "the coincidence provides an alternative understanding of the asymmetric and symmetric geometric quantum discords based on the fundamental quantum mechanical feature quantum coherence .",
    "furthermore , a recommended total quantum coherence measure has led to a new symmetric geometric quantum discord .",
    "it has been shown that this kind of total quantum coherence can be used to construct the monogamy relation between the quantum coherence and quantum concurrence which can also been understood as some interpretation of the origin of entanglement .",
    "what s more , it is also shown that the coherence of class @xmath9 can be directly connected with the violation of chsh inequality for two qubits .",
