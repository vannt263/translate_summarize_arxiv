    "this paper describes the evidence for neutrino oscillations from the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) apparatus described in reference @xcite .",
    "the result of a search for @xmath15 oscillations has been reported @xcite for data taken in 1993 and 1994 in this experiment , where an excess of events consistent with neutrino oscillations was observed .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide details of that analysis which can not be covered in a letter publication .",
    "in addition , data taken in 1995 have been included .",
    "also , further work has shown ways in which the analysis can be made more efficient so that the data sample can be increased , with the result that the beam excess is now sufficiently large that it can not be due to a statistical fluctuation of the beam - off background .",
    "the excess must be due to neutrino oscillations or to an unknown neutrino source or interaction with a very similar signature .",
    "the existence of neutrino oscillations would imply nonconservation of lepton family number and different neutrino mass eigenstates . in the standard model the neutrinos are massless .",
    "observation of neutrino oscillations would require an extension of the standard model and could help in leading to a more encompassing theory .",
    "in addition , since there are about @xmath16 neutrinos of each family left over from the initial expansion of the universe , neutrino mass of even a few ev would have profound effects on the development of structure in the universe .",
    "there are hints of neutrino mass from observations of both solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "solar models predict more neutrinos from the sun than are detected in four experiments of three quite different types @xcite .",
    "solving this problem solely by adjusting solar models requires disregarding at least two of the three types of experiment .",
    "neutrino oscillations provide a quantitative explanation of this deficit of electron neutrinos ( @xmath17 ) , requiring that the difference in the square of the masses ( @xmath18 ) of the neutrinos involved be very small , @xmath19ev@xmath20 from the implied energy dependence of the deficit . in the atmospheric neutrino case ,",
    "three experiments find the ratio of muon to electron neutrinos ( @xmath21 ) produced by secondary cosmic ray interactions to be about 60% of that expected @xcite , and this can be explained by @xmath22 or @xmath23 oscillations with large mixing .",
    "one of these experiments @xcite infers a @xmath18 of @xmath24 ev@xmath20 .",
    "however , the ( @xmath25 ) ratio observed by the three experiments can be explained by larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "this experiment deals with a range of @xmath18 values that is much larger than that applied to the solar neutrino case .",
    "it is perhaps possible @xcite to explain both the atmospheric neutrino effect and this lsnd result by the same @xmath18 .",
    "although this paper reports strong evidence for neutrino oscillations , more experimental data will be needed to firmly establish the existence of neutrino oscillations and to clarify any relationship among these several indications of oscillations .",
    "lsnd was designed to detect neutrinos originating in a proton target and beam stop at the los alamos meson physics facility ( lampf ) , and to search specifically for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 transitions with high sensitivity .",
    "this paper focuses on the first of these two complementary searches .",
    "the neutrino source and detector are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "first results on the @xmath3 search have been reported in @xcite , using data collected in 1993 and 1994 .",
    "for the experimental strategy to be successful , the beam stop is required to be a copious source of @xmath1 , while producing relatively few @xmath3 by conventional means in the energy range of interest",
    ". the detector must be able to recognize interactions of @xmath3 with precision and separate them from other neutrino types , including a large expected flux of @xmath17 .",
    "the observation of @xmath3 in excess of the number expected from conventional sources is interpreted as evidence for neutrino oscillations . however , although in this paper we will concentrate on the oscillation hypothesis , it must be noted that any exotic process that creates @xmath3 either at production , in flight , or in detection can produce a positive signal in this search .",
    "lepton number violation in muon decay , @xmath28 , is a good example and would require an extension of the standard model .    the high flux of protons on the water target produced pions copiously @xcite .",
    "most of the positive pions came to rest and decayed through the sequence @xmath29 @xmath30 supplying @xmath1 with a maximum energy of @xmath31 .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath1 flux from decay at rest ( dar ) is very well known , and the absolute value is known to 7% @xcite .",
    "the open space around the target is short compared to the pion decay length , so only a small fraction of the @xmath32 ( 3.4% ) decay in flight ( dif ) through the first reaction .",
    "a much smaller fraction ( approximately 0.001% ) of the muons dif , due to the difference in lifetimes and the fact that a @xmath32 must first dif .",
    "the symmetrical chain starting with @xmath33 might lead to an intolerable number of @xmath3 , but three factors result in a large suppression of this background .",
    "first , for the lampf proton beam and beam stop configuration , positive pion production exceeds that of negative pions by a factor of about eight .",
    "second , negative pions which come to rest in the beam stop are captured through strong interactions before they can decay , so only the 5% which dif can contribute to a @xmath3 background .",
    "( note that @xmath34 of @xmath33 and @xmath35 of @xmath32 produced in the beam stop decay in flight . )",
    "third , virtually all of the negative muons arising from such pion dif come to rest in the beam stop before decaying .",
    "most are captured from atomic orbit , a process which leads to a @xmath36 but no @xmath3 , leaving only 12% of them to decay into @xmath3 .",
    "hence one can estimate the relative yield , compared to the positive channel , to be @xmath37 .",
    "thus , it is expected that @xmath38 are present only at this level in the isotropic flux of neutrinos from the source .",
    "a detailed monte carlo simulation @xcite gives a value of @xmath39 for the ratio of @xmath40 from @xmath41 dar to @xmath42 from @xmath2 dar .",
    "it is , however , necessary to deal with the dar @xmath17 produced one - for - one with the desired @xmath1 . although it is not possible to distinguish an @xmath43 from an @xmath7 , the key to rejecting these @xmath17 as a background to the @xmath3 search is the presence of free protons ( hydrogen ) in the detector .",
    "lsnd detects @xmath3 via @xmath44 a process with a well - known cross section @xcite , followed by the neutron - capture reaction @xmath45 thus the detection signature consists of an `` electron '' signal , followed by a @xmath46 photon correlated with the electron signal in both position and time .",
    "detection of @xmath17 in lsnd is dominated by charged current reactions on @xmath47 .",
    "but an electron from @xmath48 with a dar @xmath17 has energy @xmath49 because of the mass difference of @xmath47 and @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , the production of a correlated photon via @xmath51 can likewise occur only for @xmath52 because of the threshold for free neutron production .",
    "hence , the @xmath17 background is greatly suppressed by neutron detection for @xmath53 . in addition",
    ", the requirement of a minimum @xmath54 energy of @xmath55 eliminates most of the @xmath17 background due to an _",
    "accidental _ coincidence with an uncorrelated @xmath5 signal .",
    "the detector is a tank filled with 167 metric tons of dilute liquid scintillator , located about @xmath56 from the neutrino source , and surrounded on all sides except the bottom by a liquid scintillator veto shield .",
    "the dilute mixture allows the detection in photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) of both @xmath57erenkov light and isotropic scintillation light , so that reconstruction software provides robust particle identification ( pid ) for @xmath54 along with the event vertex and direction .",
    "the electronics and data acquisition systems are designed to detect related events separated in time .",
    "this is necessary both for neutrino induced reactions and for cosmic ray backgrounds .",
    "the response of the detector in the energy range for the @xmath26 search is calibrated using a large sample of michel @xmath54 from the decays of stopped cosmic ray muons .",
    "the response to @xmath46 photons is understood by studying the capture of cosmic ray neutrons .    despite @xmath58kg / cm@xmath20 of `` overburden '' shielding above the detector , there remains a very large background to the oscillation search due to cosmic rays , which needs to be suppressed by about nine orders of magnitude to reach a sensitivity limited by the neutrino source itself .",
    "the cosmic ray muon rate through the tank is @xmath60khz , of which @xmath61 stop and decay in the scintillator , whereas even if every @xmath42 oscillated to @xmath40 , the total rate of @xmath62 interactions in the entire tank would be @xmath63 hz .",
    "there are five lines of attack in removing this background .",
    "first , an in - time veto rejects muons , but decay @xmath54 remain , along with neutrons and a small fraction of unvetoed muons due to veto shield inefficiency .",
    "second , these @xmath54 are greatly reduced by imposing a veto on any event that occurs soon after a specific number of pmt hits in the detector or veto shield .",
    "a trigger threshold at 7 muon lifetimes is increased in analysis to as much as 18 muon lifetimes .",
    "third , cosmic ray - induced neutrons are strongly suppressed by use of @xmath54 pid criteria , based upon timing , vertex , and direction information from the detector . fourth , the requirement of a correlated capture @xmath5 discriminates against cosmic ray particles other than neutrons .",
    "fifth , the level of remaining cosmic ray background is very well measured because about 14 times as much data are collected when the beam is off as on .",
    "the result of these procedures is to reduce cosmic ray particles to a small background for the dar oscillation search .",
    "we present a brief description of the detector system and data collection in chapter two .",
    "chapter three describes the methodology of identifying 2.2 mev @xmath5s associated with neutron capture on free protons .",
    "chapter four describes event selection and acceptance .",
    "chapter five contains an assessment of neutrino backgrounds .",
    "distributions of data are shown in chapter six , and fits to the data are discussed in chapter seven .",
    "an interpretation of the data in terms of neutrino oscillations is given in chapter eight , together with a comparison with other neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "reference @xcite contains a detailed description of the neutrino source and detector and a discussion of detector performance . here",
    "the detector is described briefly in section 2.2 and the veto shield in section 2.3 .",
    "this experiment is carried out at lampf using 800@xmath64 protons from the linear accelerator .",
    "pions were produced from 14772 coulombs of proton beam at the primary beam stop over three years of operation between 1993 and 1995 .",
    "there were 1787 coulombs in 1993 , 5904 coulombs in 1994 , and 7081 coulombs in 1995 .",
    "the fraction of the total dar neutrino flux produced in each of the three years was 12% in 1993 , 42% in 1994 , and 46% in 1995 and varied slightly from the coulomb fractions due to small variations in the beam stop geometry .",
    "the duty ratio is defined to be the ratio of data collected with beam on to that with beam off .",
    "it averaged 0.070 for the entire data sample , and was 0.076 , 0.080 , and 0.060 for the years 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 , respectively .",
    "the primary beam stop consists of a 30 cm water target surrounded by steel shielding and followed by a copper beam dump .",
    "the dar neutrino flux varies approximately as @xmath65 from the average neutrino production point , where @xmath66 is the distance traveled by the neutrino .",
    "the detector is located 30 m from this main production target , while two thinner subsidiary targets are located approximately 75 m and 100 m farther upstream .",
    "the detector is a roughly cylindrical tank containing 167 tons of liquid scintillator and viewed by 1220 uniformly spaced @xmath67 hamamatsu pmts .",
    "the digitized time and pulse height of each of these pmts ( and each of the 292 veto shield pmts ) are recorded when the deposited energy in the tank exceeds a threshold of about @xmath68 ( electron equivalent energy ) with less than 4 veto pmt hits .",
    "activity in the detector or veto shield during the 51.2 @xmath69 preceding a primary trigger is also recorded , provided there are @xmath70 detector pmt hits or @xmath71 veto pmt hits .",
    "data after the primary are recorded for 1 ms with a threshold of about @xmath72 .",
    "the detector operates without reference to the beam spill , but the state of the beam is recorded with the event .",
    "approximately @xmath73 of the data is taken between beam spills .",
    "this allows an accurate measurement and subtraction of cosmic ray background surviving the event selection criteria .",
    "the detector scintillator consists of mineral oil ( @xmath74 ) in which is dissolved a small concentration ( 0.031",
    "g / l ) of b - pbd @xcite .",
    "this mixture allows the separation of @xmath57erenkov light and scintillation light and produces about 33 photoelectrons per mev of electron energy deposited in the oil .",
    "the combination of the two sources of light provides direction information and makes pid possible for relativistic particles .",
    "identification of neutrons is accomplished through the detection of the @xmath46 @xmath5 from neutron capture on free protons .",
    "note that the oil consists almost entirely of carbon and hydrogen .",
    "the fractional mass of oxygen and nitrogen in the oil from the b - pbd ( 0.031 g / l of @xmath75 ) and the vitamin e added as a preservative ( 0.010",
    "g / l of @xmath76 ) is about @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "also , nitrogen is bubbled through the oil continually to remove oxygen that can decrease the oil s attenuation length . however , the fractional mass due to this nitrogen is @xmath79 .",
    "the veto shield encloses the detector on all sides except the bottom .",
    "additional counters were placed below the veto shield after the 1993 run to reduce cosmic ray background entering through the bottom support structure .",
    "the main veto shield @xcite consists of a 15-cm layer of liquid scintillator in an external tank and 15 cm of lead shot in an internal tank .",
    "this combination of active and passive shielding tags cosmic ray muons that stop in the lead shot . a veto inefficiency @xmath80 is achieved with this detector for incident charged particles .",
    "the veto inefficiency is larger for incident cosmic - ray neutrons .",
    "the performance of the detector in the detection of 2.2 @xmath64 @xmath5s from neutron capture on free protons is discussed in this chapter .",
    "neutrons produced in the reaction @xmath81 are identified by detection of the subsequent 2.2 mev @xmath5 from the reaction @xmath82 .",
    "these recoil neutrons are produced with kinetic energy in the 0 to 5.2 @xmath64 energy range and typically travel about @xmath83 cm before capture .",
    "the expected mean capture time of 186 @xmath84 is essentially independent of the initial neutron energy because the time taken for the neutron to degrade to less than @xmath85 is small compared to 186 @xmath69 .",
    "the detector performance is measured empirically from a large sample of cosmic ray neutron events which appear in the main detector and are discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "the energy and position reconstruction of 2.2 @xmath64 @xmath5s is discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "properties of 2.2 @xmath64 @xmath5 candidates and accidental @xmath5 background are discussed in section 3.4 .",
    "a monte carlo simulation for correlated low - energy neutrons is discussed in section 3.5 .",
    "the likelihood parameter that is used to separate correlated and accidental @xmath5s is described in section 3.6 .",
    "a cosmic ray neutron sample is obtained with the following selection criteria : deposited electron equivalent energy between 36 and 60 mev , pid consistent with a neutron ( satisfying @xmath86 and @xmath87 , to reduce events with multiple neutrons , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are described in section 4.2 ) , less than 4 veto hits within the 0.5 @xmath69 event window , beam off , and at least one triggered @xmath5 event within 1 ms of the primary event . charged particles below @xmath57erenkov threshold produce less light per energy deposited than do @xmath90 electrons . also , neutrons deposit much of their energy by scattering from protons and nuclei . the energy scale used in this paper",
    "is based on the light - to - energy ratio for electrons .",
    "1 shows the time difference between neutrons that satisfy the above criteria and a subsequent @xmath5 with 21 to 50 hit pmts .",
    "the distribution is fit to a sum of an exponential for correlated @xmath5s and a flat background for accidental @xmath5s ( solid curve ) .",
    "the fitted time constant of @xmath91 @xmath92s agrees well with the 186 @xmath69 capture time for neutrons in mineral oil .",
    "the @xmath5s in the last 250 @xmath69 of the 1 ms window are almost entirely accidental @xmath5s and are used to define the characteristics of the `` accidental @xmath5 '' sample .",
    "similarly , a `` correlated @xmath5 '' sample is defined to contain a @xmath5 in the first 250 @xmath69 of the 1 ms window after subtraction of the accidental @xmath5 contribution ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "activities with 21 to 50 hit pmts , with average charge per pmt hit greater than 0.8 photoelectrons , and which occur within 1 ms of the primary event are defined to be @xmath5 candidates and are fit for position with a special reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the algorithm defines the @xmath5 position to be the average of the position of all hit pmts weighted by the pulse height of each pmt .",
    "this algorithm , although simple , results in a position error which is comparable to ( or better than ) some more elaborate methods ( see section 3.4 ) .        in fig . 2",
    "is shown the observed distributions of photons from the `` correlated @xmath5 '' ( solid curve ) and `` accidental @xmath5 '' ( dashed curve ) samples .",
    "the distributions are : ( a ) the time of the @xmath5 after the primary ; ( b ) the number of photon pmt hits ; ( c ) the distance of the reconstructed @xmath5 from the primary .",
    "these three `` correlated @xmath5 '' distributions are found to be approximately independent of the primary event location in the fiducial volume .",
    "as expected from the uniformity of the oil , there is no correlation between the neutron capture time and the other two variables .",
    "furthermore , the number of photon pmt hits is observed to be independent of distance from the primary , except for a small correlation for distances beyond 2 m. events with fewer pmt hits have a slightly broader distance distribution , which is expected because the position correlation of the @xmath5 and primary vertex is dominated by reconstruction errors .",
    "however , the observed distance distribution from the cosmic ray neutron sample is broader than expected for neutrons from the reaction @xmath93 because the primary arises from an initial neutron interaction of higher energy and thus travels slightly farther before reaching thermal energies .",
    "monte carlo studies ( see section 3.5 ) indicate that the mean measured distance distribution is up to @xmath94 cm larger on average than for the low - energy neutrons of interest .",
    "the dependence of the three `` accidental @xmath5 '' distributions on primary event locations was also investigated . for this study",
    "the reconstructed @xmath5 position was required to be within 2.5 m of the primary vertex , a criterion imposed in the @xmath5 identification procedure described later .",
    "the three distributions are uniform over the fiducial volume except near the bottom , upstream corner of the detector ( see section 3.4.2 ) , where there is a higher rate of accidental @xmath5s . for primary events in this region , both the number of photon pmt hits and the distance distribution have lower average values than elsewhere in the detector .",
    "the reconstructed position for accidental @xmath5s in the x - z and y - z projections is shown in fig .",
    "the coordinate system is defined such that y is pointing up in the vertical direction and z is pointing downstream along the cylindrical axis of the detector .",
    "these distributions are non - uniform and show a concentration near the upstream , bottom portion of the detector",
    ". this concentration may be due to steel shielding underneath the detector with a high level of radioactivity or to a cable penetration though the veto system in that region .",
    "this non - uniformity is taken into account in the fit analyses of chapter 7 .",
    "the average accidental @xmath5 rate over the entire detector is @xmath95 khz in 1993 , @xmath96 khz in 1994 , and @xmath97 khz in 1995 .",
    "cosmic ray neutrons selected are of higher energy than those from the neutrino oscillation reaction @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the distance of the reconstructed photon from the primary is on average shorter for the neutrino oscillation reaction than it is for cosmic ray neutrons . in order to compute the expected distance distribution between the reconstructed @xmath7 and the 2.2 @xmath64 @xmath5 ,",
    "three monte carlo distance distributions were used .",
    "( 1 ) positrons of the expected energy distribution were generated and passed through the monte carlo detector simulation @xcite and reconstruction to find the distribution of distances between the @xmath7 point of origin and reconstructed position .",
    "( 2 ) a separate monte carlo program designed to track low energy neutrons was used to find the distribution in distance between neutron production and capture .",
    "this program simulated elastic scattering from the carbon and hydrogen atoms according to tabulated neutron cross sections .",
    "neutrons were tracked even after they have thermalized , at which point it becomes important that neutron absorption with resulting @xmath5 production on hydrogen and carbon was also included .",
    "( 3 ) the detector simulation is used to simulate scintillation light produced by the 2.2 mev @xmath5 .",
    "two extra single photoelectron hits were randomly added to the hit pmts to simulate pmt noise , which is based on the average pmt noise rate of about 3 khz .",
    "the photon reconstruction algorithm described in section 3.3 was used to compute the @xmath5 position , from which the distance between the generated and reconstructed photon is obtained .",
    "the expected distribution in distance between the reconstructed @xmath7 and the 2.2 @xmath64 @xmath5 is the convolution of these three distributions and is shown as the solid histogram in fig .",
    "this distribution is dominated by reconstruction errors in the @xmath5 position .",
    "the travel distance of low energy neutrons , @xmath7 reconstruction position error , and pmt noise contribute little to the overall distance distribution .",
    "hence , the distribution is narrower , as expected , but not vastly different from that obtained in section 3.4 from cosmic ray neutrons , shown as the dashed histogram in fig .",
    "we use both distributions for the fits described in chapter 7 and obtain similar results .      the three `` correlated @xmath5 '' distributions in fig . 2 are used to determine the likelihood , @xmath98 , that the @xmath5 is correlated with the primary event .",
    "similarly , the three `` accidental @xmath5 '' distributions in fig . 2 are used to determine the likelihood , @xmath99 , that the @xmath5 is accidental and uncorrelated with the primary event .",
    "each likelihood , therefore , is the product of the three probability densities , @xmath100 . a likelihood ratio , @xmath101 , for the event is then defined as the ratio of these likelihoods , @xmath102 . because of the small correlations described in section 3.4.1 and the adjustment to the @xmath103 distribution discussed in section 3.5 , these @xmath104s are only approximate likelihoods .",
    "moreover , @xmath101 does not allow for the variation of accidental rates with the position of the primary particle .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath101 is a very powerful tool for separating correlated from uncorrelated @xmath5s , and the @xmath103 and rate effects are fully allowed for in the fitting procedures to be described later in this paper .",
    "5 shows the measured @xmath101 distribution for events with the @xmath5 correlated ( solid ) and uncorrelated ( dashed ) with the primary event .",
    "as expected , the uncorrelated events are concentrated at low values of @xmath101 . for events with multiple @xmath5s ,",
    "the @xmath5 with the maximum r is used .",
    "r is set to 0 for events without a @xmath5 that reconstructs within 2.5 m of the primary , has 21 to 50 pmt hits , and occurs within 1 ms of the primary event .",
    "the definition of @xmath101 is always based on the spectra of fig .",
    "2 , using the @xmath103 distribution measured from cosmic ray neutrons . however",
    ", if @xmath103 for correlated photons is actually distributed as given by the monte carlo calculation of section 3.5 , then the distribution of @xmath101 for correlated photons will be given by the dotted curve in fig .",
    "5 instead of the solid histogram .",
    "both versions are tried for the fits to be described in section 7.1 .",
    "it should also be noted that while the accidental photon spectrum shown in fig .",
    "5 is averaged over primary event locations in the fiducial volume , those fits actually use a spectrum which takes the local accidental rate into account .    the efficiency for producing and detecting a 2.2 @xmath64 correlated @xmath5 within 2.5 m , with 21 to 50 pmt hits , and within 1 ms was determined to be @xmath105 ( using the solid curve of fig .",
    "this efficiency is the product of the probability that the @xmath5 trigger is not vetoed by a veto shield signal within the previous 15.2 @xmath69 ( @xmath106 ) , the data acquisition livetime ( @xmath107 , lower for @xmath5s than for primary events ) , the requirement that the @xmath5 occurs between 8 @xmath69 and 1000 @xmath69 after the primary event ( @xmath108 ) , the requirement that the @xmath5 has between 21 and 50 hit pmts ( @xmath109 ) , and the requirement that the @xmath5 reconstructs within 2.5 m of the primary event ( @xmath110 ) . > from the cosmic - ray michel electron data , the average probability of finding an accidental uncorrelated @xmath5 within the same cuts is @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath101 distributions shown in fig .",
    "5 are then used to determine the efficiencies for finding a correlated or uncorrelated @xmath5 satisfying a particular @xmath101 criterion .",
    "for example , the efficiency that an accidental @xmath5 satisfies @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) is @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , while the efficiency for a correlated @xmath5 is @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the accidental rate depends on the position of the primary event within the fiducial volume , as seen in fig .",
    "3 . however , fig .",
    "6 shows that the r distributions are almost identical for @xmath118 in each of the four quadrants of the y - z plane for correlated @xmath5s ( solid ) and accidental @xmath5s ( dashed ) .",
    "the signature for the principal oscillation search is two - fold  a positron and a correlated 2.2 @xmath64 @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis is performed for two ranges of positron energy . in order to establish the presence of an excess",
    ", the positron is required to be in the energy range @xmath119 mev , where the known neutrino backgrounds are small .",
    "a looser energy requirement , @xmath120 mev , provides a larger range of @xmath121 and is used to determine the oscillation probability and the @xmath18 vs @xmath122 allowed range .",
    "isolation of an oscillation signal in this experiment thus consists of pid of the positron from the reaction @xmath81 ( without distinguishing between positrons and electrons ) and positive identification of the associated neutron by the presence of a correlated 2.2 @xmath64 @xmath5 from the reaction @xmath123 .",
    "backgrounds then fall into three categories .",
    "two of them are beam - related , the first involving events which include a primary particle identified as an @xmath54 plus a correlated neutron - capture signal , and the second involving events with an accidental @xmath5 signal instead of a correlated neutron .",
    "the largest category of backgrounds is from beam - unrelated cosmic rays . while the latter are eventually subtracted statistically using beam - off data , the strategy for positron selection is to reduce these backgrounds to a low level before making the subtraction .",
    "these positron selection criteria are described in this chapter .",
    "the tools for selecting associated neutrons have been presented in chapter 3 and are applied to event selection in chapters 6 and 7 .",
    "the positron selection criteria and efficiencies are summarized in table i for two different selections .",
    "selection i is identical to what has been used previously @xcite , while selection vi makes use of additional criteria which reduce the beam - off background and increase the acceptance . selections ii - v are variations of selections i and vi and are discussed at the end of the chapter .    to establish an event excess ,",
    "positrons are required to have an energy in the @xmath119 mev range .",
    "the narrow energy range is chosen , as shown in fig .",
    "7 , because it is above the @xmath124 endpoint and in the range expected for oscillation events .",

    ", one must consider the possibility , nonetheless , that neutrons from the target could find their way into the tank .",
    "a limit on the beam neutron background relative to the cosmic neutron background is set by looking for a beam - on minus beam - off excess of neutron events in the @xmath187 electron equivalent energy range .",
    "this comparison is made by examining neutron candidates which pass neutron , rather than @xmath7 , pid criteria . for events with @xmath188 and an associated @xmath189 within @xmath190 and @xmath191 , 89700 beam - off events and 6915 beam - on events",

    "this excess of events is consistent with the @xmath193 events expected from @xmath194 scattering .",
    "however , even if the entire excess is interpreted as beam neutrons entering the tank , fewer than @xmath195 of the beam - on events are actually beam - related . applying this same ratio for neutrons _ passing _ the @xmath7 pid criteria ,",
    "the beam - related neutron background in the @xmath7 sample is less than 0.03 times the number of beam - unrelated neutrons .",
    "based upon the r distribution of the beam - off data sample , less than @xmath196 of beam - unrelated events in the selected @xmath7 sample are due to neutrons .",
    "hence the beam - related neutron background is less than 0.005 times the total beam - unrelated background , and is negligible .",
    "the largest beam - related background with a correlated neutron is due to @xmath3 produced in the beam stop by conventional processes .",
    "such events are detected in the same way as oscillation candidates , via @xmath198 .",
    "their most important source is the dar of @xmath41 in the beam stop .",
    "as outlined in section  1.2 , the @xmath40 flux from @xmath41 decay is suppressed by more than three orders of magnitude compared to the @xmath42 flux from @xmath2 decay .",
    "another possible source of @xmath3 , the direct decay of @xmath199 , is negligible , as a consequence of its low branching ratio ( @xmath200 ) , the 1/8 ratio of @xmath33 to @xmath32 in the target , and the capture of @xmath33 in the material of the beam dump .",
    "the product of neutrino flux ( @xmath201 ) , number of protons on target ( @xmath202 , corresponding to 14772 c ) , average cross section over the entire energy range ( @xmath203 ) @xcite , the number of free protons in the fiducial volume ( @xmath204 ) , the fraction of events with @xmath205 mev ( 0.45 ) , and the average positron reconstruction efficiency after cuts ( 0.36 ) , gives a total background in the full positron sample of @xmath206 events .",
    "note that the positron efficiency is energy dependent .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is largely due to that in the @xmath3 flux @xcite , but also includes contributions for the efficiency ( section 4.3 ) .",
    "the energy - dependence of this background is determined by folding the @xmath3 spectrum from @xmath41 dar ( softer than the @xmath1 dar spectrum and hence of potential oscillation events ) with the detection cross section .",
    "it is shown in fig . 16 .",
    "a related background is due to @xmath207 scattering .",
    "the cross section to the @xmath208 ground state is calculated to be @xmath209 cm@xmath20 @xcite and the cross section to the @xmath210 final state must be at least a factor of two smaller , especially because the first four excited states of @xmath208 are stable against neutron emission .",
    "therefore , we estimate that this background is @xmath211 of the @xmath81 background and is negligible .",
    "furthermore , the maximum positron energy from this background is 36.1 mev , so that almost all of the positron energy spectrum is @xmath212 mev .",
    "the second most important source of beam - related background events with correlated neutrons is the misidentification of @xmath1 charged - current interactions in the tank as @xmath3 events . because of",
    "the energy needed to produce a @xmath2 , such a @xmath1 must arise from a @xmath33 that decays in flight . in the tank it interacts by either @xmath213 or ( less often ) @xmath214 , followed by @xmath215 .",
    "there are four possible reasons for the misidentification .",
    "first , the muon can be missed because the deposited energy is below the 18 phototube threshold for activity triggers .",
    "this is either because the muon is too low in energy or is produced behind the phototube surfaces .",
    "the detector monte carlo simulation is used to show that this threshold corresponds to a @xmath41 kinetic energy @xmath216 of 3 to @xmath68 .",
    "since the associated neutron also produces a little light in the tank , the background will be quoted for the case of muons below @xmath217 .",
    "their yield is computed by folding the dif @xmath1 flux with the charged - current cross sections .",
    "the background rate from @xmath213 is written as the product of the number of protons on target ( @xmath202 ) , the total @xmath1 flux ( @xmath218 ) , the average flux - weighted cross section ( @xmath219 , including the @xmath42 energy range below threshold ) @xcite , the fraction of @xmath2 having @xmath220 ( 0.0215 ) , the number of free protons in the fiducial volume ( @xmath204 ) , the positron efficiency ( 0.37 ) , and the fraction of events with @xmath221 ( 0.58 ) , for a background of 1.9 events .",
    "( note that the positron efficiency varies with energy . )",
    "similar estimates for the backgrounds from @xmath214 and @xmath222 @xcite add 0.1 and 0.4 events , respectively , for a total of @xmath223 events .",
    "it is estimated @xcite that about 80% of the @xmath224 and 6% of the @xmath144 scattering events will have a recoil neutron .",
    "the 50% systematic error includes the uncertainty in the threshold , as well as smaller contributions from the @xmath1 flux and efficiency .",
    "second , a @xmath2 above the hit threshold can be missed if a prompt decay to @xmath7 caused the muon and electron to be collected in a single event which is then identified as an @xmath54 .",
    "this effect is considerably suppressed by the @xmath125 cuts and the requirement that the reconstructed time be consistent with the triggered event time .",
    "the detector monte carlo simulation shows that this misidentification only occurs for @xmath2 decays within @xmath225 , decreases with @xmath216 , and is almost zero above @xmath226 . using the monte carlo misidentification probabilities ,",
    "a calculation similar to that above implies a background of @xmath227 events .",
    "third , the @xmath2 can be lost because it is produced behind the pmt surface and the electron radiates a hard @xmath5 that reconstructs within the fiducial volume .",
    "a background of @xmath228 events is estimated from the monte carlo simulation .",
    "fourth , a muon can be missed by trigger inefficiency . in 1995 , we acquired for many online positron triggers complete digitization information for all veto and detector phototubes over the 6 @xmath92s interval prior to the positron .",
    "analysis of these data , discussed in section 7.3.2 , shows the trigger inefficiency for low - energy muons to be negligible .",
    "the total background due to misidentified muons is thus @xmath229 events .",
    "it has a detected energy spectrum which is very close to that for positrons from @xmath2 decay .",
    "additional backgrounds are from @xmath3 produced by @xmath230 and @xmath231 dif .",
    "these @xmath3 can interact on either @xmath232 or a free proton to yield the oscillation signature of a positron and a recoil neutron . for @xmath233 ,",
    "@xmath228 events are estimated .",
    "the reactions @xmath234 and @xmath235 are negligible ( @xmath236 events ) for @xmath237 mev and can not occur for @xmath238 mev",
    ". other backgrounds , for example @xmath239 with @xmath240 mev and @xmath241 followed by @xmath242 , are also negligible .",
    "there are eight beam - related backgrounds without neutrons that are considered ( see tables ii and iii ) .",
    "although their total is determined empirically by a fit involving the photon parameter r ( see section 7.1 ) , they are also estimated individually in the @xmath119 @xmath64 energy range before the associated @xmath5 requirement is imposed .",
    "these estimates are outlined below , using positron selection criterion vi as defined in chapter 4 .",
    "the first background is due to @xmath243 dif in the beam stop , followed by @xmath144 and @xmath244 in the detector .",
    "this background occurs if the muon is missed because it is below the 18 pmt threshold , either because the muon is produced at too low an energy ( .005 probability ) or behind the pmt surface ( .001 probability ) or the muon decays promptly so that the muon and electron are considered one particle that pass the pid ( .001 probability ) .",
    "the estimated number of events is the sum of the above contributions ( .007 probability ) multiplied by the @xmath36 flux ( @xmath245/cm@xmath20/p ) , the number of protons on target ( @xmath202 ) , the flux - average cross section ( @xmath246 cm@xmath20 ) @xcite , the electron efficiency(0.39 ) , the fraction of events with @xmath119 mev ( 0.58 ) , and the number of @xmath247 atoms in the fiducial volume ( @xmath248 ) , which results in a total of @xmath249 events .",

    "other backgrounds are due to @xmath254 and @xmath255 dif followed by @xmath256 scattering ( @xmath257 events ) , and @xmath258 dif followed by @xmath259 coherent scattering @xcite ( @xmath260 events ) .      the next background we consider is @xmath261 and @xmath262 elastic scattering from @xmath2 dar in the beam stop .",

    "finally , the @xmath312 and the s distributions , discussed in chapter 4 , are shown in fig .",
    "26 and fig . 27 .",
    "cosmic - ray background is larger in the outer regions of the detector and where the veto has gaps  beneath the detector ( large negative y ) , and around the periphery of the upstream end at large negative z. because the beam - on data includes cosmic - ray background , it is expected to show concentrations in the same regions of the detector .",
    "in fact , any effect from strong or electromagnetic interactions coming from outside the detector should be concentrated near the detector boundary .",
    "the source of neutrinos is concentrated in the region of the beam stop described in reference @xcite .",
    "the distance from the beam stop to the center of the detector is 29.8 m , and the angular distribution of the neutrinos is isotropic .",
    "the neutrino flux from targets a1 and a2 , which are 105 m and 130 m away , respectively , imposes a small variation on the flux distribution calculated using the a6 location .",
    "neutrino event distributions in the detector are expected to reflect the varying solid angle of the detector with small effects from the finite extent of the source .",
    "this is simulated in detail , although the deviation from uniformity is small , and these fluxes are used in estimating rates .",
    "it is important to test whether the spatial distributions of beam excess events are compatible with neutrino oscillations . to this end",
    ", a kolmogorov statistic is computed for each distribution being tested for consistency . for a given variable",
    "v , an observed cumulative probability distribution , @xmath313 , is computed for beam - on data .",
    "if @xmath314 is the number of beam - on events , then @xmath315 is the number of beam - on events with v less than @xmath316 .",
    "@xmath313 is a step function .",
    "if the distribution in v is consistent with beam - off background plus a contribution from neutrino interactions , then @xmath313 should be approximately equal to an expected cumulative probability distribution , @xmath317 , that is a combination of these two contributions .",
    "the kolmogorov statistic , k , is the maximum distance between @xmath313 and @xmath317 .",
    "the probability distribution of k is computed for the case of the beam - on excess coming from neutrino interactions .",
    "one contribution to @xmath318 is the expected number of events from the cosmic background .",
    "if there are @xmath319 beam - off events , and @xmath66 is the ratio between beam - on and beam - off time , then the expected total number from cosmic background is @xmath320 .",
    "if the step function , @xmath321 , is defined the same as @xmath313 , except for beam - off events instead of beam - on ones , then the expected contribution to @xmath318 from cosmic background is equal to @xmath322 .",
    "the remaining contribution to @xmath318 is from the @xmath323 excess of presumably neutrino events , which should be distributed according to a smooth cumulative probability distribution , @xmath324 . for each variable ,",
    "v , we take @xmath325 to be the expected fraction of neutrino interactions in our acceptance with v below @xmath316 .",
    "it is computed with a monte carlo program that includes the position dependent neutrino flux and position dependent positron detection efficiency , and of course includes the requirement that positrons be reconstructed at least 35 cm from the photomultiplier tube faces .",
    "then @xmath326 is the expected contribution to @xmath318 from the beam - on excess if that excess is from neutrino interactions .",
    "thus @xmath327    the kolmogorov statistic , k , is easily determined , given the functions , @xmath313 and @xmath317 .",
    "each computation of k involves comparing a cumulative distribution of data ( @xmath313 ) with a function that is a linear combination of a distribution of other data ( @xmath321 ) and a smooth theoretical function ( @xmath324 ) .",
    "the probability distribution of k is not given in standard tables for such a case .",
    "we therefore perform a monte carlo computation of the probability of k accidentally being at least as large as is measured .",
    "one complication is that the z distribution for neutrino oscillation events depends on the value of @xmath18 . in the limit of large @xmath18 , however , the distribution has the same @xmath328 dependence as for other neutrino interactions , where @xmath329 is the distance from the neutrino production point to the neutrino interaction location .",
    "the consistency checks are calculated for this case .",
    "if k is measured to be especially high , i.e. , if there is an especially low probability of k accidentally being higher , then the observed distribution is inconsistent with the assumption that the beam - on excess comes from neutrino interactions in the detector tank .",
    "the consistency checks on the spatial distribution of the data amount to finding such probabilities for each of several distributions , including those shown in figs .",
    "18 and 22 .",
    "a high probability near one means that the distribution is very similar to the expected distribution , while a probability near zero means that the distribution is not very similar .",
    "results are presented in table vi with various cuts for identification of the @xmath5 from @xmath6 .",
    "if the gap in the veto beneath the detector is responsible for the beam - on excess , the y distribution would be expected to show an especially low probability .",
    "if the holes in the veto at its upstream end are responsible for the excess , the z distribution or the distribution in distance from the bottom upstream corner with low y , z would show a low probability .",
    "if the events are anomalously concentrated towards the outer part of the detector , then there would be a low probability for the variable that measured the distance from the pmt faces .",
    "these probabilities are computed for various cuts on r , the photon discrimination parameter .",
    "the probabilities for @xmath305 are observed to be smaller than the probabilities for @xmath155 or @xmath112 .",
    "this is due to the high statistics of the @xmath305 sample , which makes this sample very sensitive to uncertainties in the expected position distribution .",
    "for example , the z distribution and low yz distribution probabilities for @xmath305 increase from 0.047 to 0.331 and from 0.016 to 0.074 , respectively , when one assumes that the events are uniformly distributed in the detector instead of having a @xmath328 position dependence .",
    "although this assumption is unrealistic for the large expected beam - associated neutrino background with @xmath305 ( see table iv ) , a contribution from neutrino oscillations at low @xmath18 would have a uniform position dependence .",
    "the energy distribution of events with @xmath112 has been subjected to the same kolmogorov test as in the previous section on the geometric distribution of events .",
    "events near and above 60 mev provide incentive for this test . the cumulative distribution for neutrinos , @xmath330 , is taken to be the expected energy distribution for neutrino oscillations in the limit of high @xmath331 .",
    "the contribution shown in fig .",
    "17 from known neutrino interactions is ignored , as well as possible contributions from dif oscillation events .",
    "the probability that the energy distribution for @xmath112 is consistent with this hypothetical distribution is 35% for @xmath332 and 37% for @xmath333 .",
    "there is no evidence of an excess of events above 60 mev . for the @xmath334 mev interval",
    "there are 4 events beam on and 62 events beam off , corresponding to an excess of @xmath335 events .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "17b shows that there is no incompatibility between the oscillation hypothesis and the data excess , given present statistical errors .",
    "another consistency check on our data and analysis methods is whether the evidence for neutrino oscillations is reasonably uniform from one year of data collection to the next .",
    "small problems with the apparatus , corrected as the experiment progressed , can make spurious signals appear only in data collected before hardware repairs .",
    "unconscious prejudices can lead experimenters to tune cuts until a selection is found that accidentally gives a spurious signal .",
    "such a selection would not show a signal for data collected after the cuts have been tuned .    in order to test for time variation of our data , we bin beam - on and beam - off data for @xmath112 by the year in which it is collected .",
    "most changes in apparatus and procedures are made in the periods between the running periods of different years .",
    "we consider two selections for the data : selection i , which is the same as was used before beginning the 1995 runs and on which a previous publication @xcite is based ; and selection vi , which includes the the most recent analysis improvements .",
    "the excesses ( beam - on minus duty ratio times beam - off ) should be roughly proportional to the @xmath336 fractions of integrated beam intensity during each time period .",
    "the consistency checks test how probable are the observed deviations from rough proportionality .",
    "table vii shows the results of two types of consistency checks .",
    "`` prob 1 '' is the probability of beam - on data accidentally being distributed in an equally likely or less likely way than is observed , given the beam - off numbers of events in each year and the duty ratios . `` prob 2 '' is the probability of the 1995 beam - on number accidentally being as low as is observed given the beam - off numbers in each year , the total beam - on number of events , and the duty ratios .",
    "no probability is so low as to demonstrate a serious inconsistency .",
    "for the observed excess , the overall oscillation probability is found by fitting the r distribution to determine the fraction of events with a correlated @xmath5 .",
    "the overall oscillation probability is the number of excess correlated events divided by the total number of events expected for 100% @xmath337 transmutation .",
    "note that for any experiment the oscillation probability is dependent on the experiment s geometry and energy range in addition to @xmath338 and @xmath18 .",
    "the one - parameter @xmath11 fit to the r distribution takes into account the position dependence of the @xmath5 rates by using the actual beam - on and beam - off events that satisfy the oscillation criteria .",
    "the accidental @xmath5 spatial distributions are determined from laser calibration events .",
    "28 shows the r distribution , beam - on minus beam - off excess , for events that satisfy selection vi ( see chapter 4 ) and that have energies in the range @xmath120 mev .",
    "there are 1763 beam - on events and 11981 beam - off events in this energy range , corresponding to a beam on - off excess of 924.3 events .",
    "the r distribution is fit to the two different r shapes discussed in chapter 3 and illustrated in fig .",
    "the fit using the r shape from cosmic ray neutrons has a @xmath339 d.o.f . and determines that @xmath340 events have a @xmath5 that is correlated with the primary , while the fit using the monte carlo r shape has a @xmath341 d.o.f . and determines that @xmath342 events have a @xmath5 that is correlated with the primary .",
    "averaging these numbers and subtracting the neutrino background with a correlated @xmath5 ( @xmath343 events ) results in a net excess of @xmath344 events .",
    "( if the number of events with a correlated @xmath5 is set to the background estimate of 12.5 events , the @xmath11 increases by 15.0 and 14.1 , respectively , compared to the above two fits . )",
    "this corresponds to an oscillation probability of @xmath345 , where the first error is statistical and the second error is the systematic error arising from uncertainties in the neutrino flux ( 7% ) , @xmath7 efficiency ( 7% ) , and @xmath5 efficiency ( 7% ) .",
    "the latter two uncertainties are lower than in our previous publication @xcite due to improved understanding of the detector performance .",
    "note that the statistical error is non - gaussian and corresponds to an increase of the @xmath11 by one over the minimum @xmath11 fit .",
    "the systematic error is for both the background estimate and the expected number of oscillation events .",
    "also , @xmath346 events do not have a correlated @xmath5 , which agrees with the estimated neutrino background of @xmath347 events from table viii .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "28 is the best fit to the data , while the dashed curve is the component of the fit with an uncorrelated @xmath5 .",
    "table viii summarizes the results of the @xmath11 fit .",
    "also shown in table viii is the result of a likelihood fit that uses for each positron event the local accidental r distribution rather than a weighted average , and the number of signal and background events in the @xmath120 mev energy range with @xmath112 .",
    "assuming that the observed event excess is due to neutrino oscillations , a likelihood fit is performed to determine favored regions in the @xmath18 vs. @xmath122 plane , where @xmath18 is the difference of the squares of the approximate mass eigenstates and @xmath348 is the mixing angle . a general formalism for neutrino oscillations would involve all three generations and the possibility of cp violation . in fact , any pair of neutrinos ( @xmath40 , @xmath42 , @xmath349 , or more properly @xmath350 , @xmath351 , or @xmath352 ) with a @xmath18 in the region of experimental sensitivity could lead to a signal in a @xmath337 oscillation search .",
    "however , here the formalism is simplified by assuming that only two generation mixing is important .",
    "then the oscillation probability can be written @xmath353 where @xmath329 is the distance from neutrino production to detection in meters and @xmath354 is the neutrino energy in mev .",
    "the discussion is limited to this restricted formalism solely as a basis for experimental parameterization , and no judgement is made as to the simplicity of the actual situation .",
    "four measured quantities are used to separate oscillation candidates from background and determine the parameters of the oscillation .",
    "these are @xmath355 ( the measured energy of the positron ) , @xmath101 ( the gamma likelihood ratio ) , @xmath356 ( the cosine of the angle between the @xmath357 and @xmath186 directions ) , and @xmath329 ( the measured distance from the @xmath42 source ) .",
    "the 1763 beam - on events passing selection vi are binned in four dimensions according to these measured quantities . using the background estimates from chapter 5 ,",
    "the distributions of beam - related background events in these variables are calculated . to calculate the beam - unrelated background ,",
    "the measured beam - off data set is smoothed and scaled by the duty ratio .    a likelihood function , @xmath104 ,",
    "is constructed : @xmath358 where @xmath359 is the total number of bins , @xmath360 is the number of beam - on events in bin @xmath361 , and @xmath362 is the expected number in bin @xmath361 .",
    "the expected number in bin @xmath361 may be written @xmath363 where @xmath364 is the calculated number of events in bin @xmath361 due to beam - unrelated background , @xmath365 is that due to beam - related background , and @xmath366 is the expected number of events for a particular pair of @xmath367 values .",
    "this likelihood function reaches its maxima at @xmath368 and @xmath369 .",
    "the individual distributions of @xmath355 , @xmath101 , @xmath356 , and @xmath329 for the data are compared with projections of the expected four - dimensional distribution ( including oscillations at @xmath369 ) in fig .",
    "note that most of the data in fig .",
    "29 is from beam - unrelated or neutrino - induced background .",
    "the @xmath370 of this likelihood function is calculated for a range of @xmath371 values .",
    "regions within 2.3 and 4.5 log - likelihood units of vertical distance from the peak are identified .",
    "these regions are called `` 90% '' and `` 99% ''",
    "likelihood regions .",
    "( they do not define confidence limits , but do show the regions favored by the experiment . ) these favored regions are calculated several times while varying inputs to reflect systematic uncertainties .",
    "the systematic effects varied included : the method used for smoothing the beam - off data , the method used for calculation of the correlated @xmath101 distribution , and the normalization of the backgrounds ( both beam - related and beam - unrelated are shifted by @xmath372 ) .",
    "also , the product of neutrino flux and detection efficiency was allowed to change by @xmath373 .",
    "regions which are favored in any of these systematic investigations are shown in fig .",
    "30 , where the darkly - shaded and lightly - shaded regions correspond to 90% and 99% likelihood regions , respectively .",
    "this figure shows discrimination against some values of @xmath18 which would be allowed in an analysis that simply took the size of the oscillation signal into account .",
    "this discrimination may be understood from the energy plot of fig .",
    "the presence of relatively high - energy oscillation candidates tends to exclude @xmath18 near integral multiples of @xmath374 .",
    "( these values of @xmath18 give @xmath375 near 0 for the highest energy @xmath1 . )",
    "some of the favored region is excluded by the ongoing karmen experiment @xcite at isis , e776 at bnl @xcite , and the bugey reactor experiment @xcite ( see section 8.2 ) .",
    "however , there remains a region at small values of @xmath18 and @xmath338 where our oscillation parameters are not in conflict with any other experiment .",
    "it is difficult to place additional constraints on @xmath18 with the few events collected to date .",
    "31 shows the @xmath121 distribution of the high-@xmath101 data ( from the top 3 @xmath101 bins of fig .",
    "29 ) compared with expectations for several pairs of @xmath371 .",
    "( @xmath354 is calculated from the measured values @xmath128 and @xmath356 . )",

    ", these backgrounds are each estimated to be about an order of magnitude smaller than the observed excess .",
    "additional arguments , however , can be made to demonstrate that these backgrounds are not likely to explain the signal .      because the @xmath40 spectrum from @xmath41 decay is softer than the @xmath42 spectrum from @xmath2 decay , one can , in principle , distinguish between @xmath337 oscillations and @xmath41 dar background by fitting the energy distribution .",
    "this is accomplished by allowing the @xmath41 background to float and determining how good a fit ( see section 7.2 ) can be obtained without neutrino oscillations .",
    "the best such fit has a @xmath41 dar background contribution that is 8 times larger than the estimated background of @xmath377 events ( see table viii ) .",
    "however , even with such an increase , this best fit has the log of the likelihood function 2.2 units less than the best oscillation fit .",
    "therefore , our observed excess is less compatible with the shape of the @xmath41 dar background .      as mentioned in chapter 2 ,",
    "the nominal trigger threshold for past activity in lsnd is 18 hit pmts .",
    "this allows a background to arise from @xmath33 dif in the beam stop followed by @xmath376 scattering , where the @xmath2 is below the 18 pmt threshold .",
    "( background contributions also arise from @xmath378 and @xmath379 scattering . )",
    "we are confident of our calculation of this background in chapter 5 .",
    "however , to ensure that such events do not explain our observed signal , the trigger was modified for the 1995 running so that all hit pmts within @xmath380 and @xmath381 @xmath92s of selected events are recorded as two extra events .",
    "32 shows the total number of hit pmts in the detector tank for those extra events that occur @xmath382s and @xmath383s prior to oscillation candidate events .",
    "the candidates are in the @xmath384 mev energy range with ( a ) @xmath385 and ( b ) @xmath112 .",
    "the data points are the beam on events , while the solid curve is what is expected from random pmt hits as determined from the sample of laser calibration events .",
    "there is good agreement between the data and the laser events and little evidence of candidates from @xmath33 dif background , which the monte carlo simulation estimates would hit an additional 10 pmts on average .",
    "this also confirms that the trigger operated correctly .",
    "the sample of @xmath144 scattering events also has been studied to check that the observed hit pmt distribution from the recoil @xmath92 and @xmath386 agrees with our monte carlo simulation .",
    "this sample is cleanly obtained by requiring a coincidence between the @xmath92 and the decay electron and by performing a beam - on minus - off subtraction .",
    "33 shows the observed hit pmt distribution for all @xmath153 scattering events ( including @xmath144 , @xmath387 , and @xmath376 ) for events with ( a ) @xmath305 and ( b ) @xmath112 .",
    "the solid histogram in each case is the prediction from the monte carlo simulation , normalized to the data .",
    "the agreement is excellent and serves as a check of our background estimate from chapter 5 .",
    "this paper reports an excess of events that is consistent with the reaction @xmath81 and is an order of magnitude larger than what is expected from conventional physics processes",
    ". this excess is , therefore , evidence for @xmath388 oscillations within the allowed range of fig .",
    "note that for three neutrino flavors there must be three - generation mixing , so that the oscillation probability is in general a sum of three terms , where each term has an oscillation wavelength determined by one of the three different @xmath18 values . however , there are other exotic physics explanations of the observed excess .",
    "one example is the lepton - number - violating decay @xmath389 , which can explain these observations with a branching ratio of @xmath390 .",
    "the published upper limit on this `` wrong - sign '' muon decay mode is @xmath391 @xcite ; however , a preliminary report from the karmen experiment @xcite gives a much stricter limit , @xmath392 at 90% c.l .",
    "if an excess similar to that reported in the present paper is observed also in the @xmath32 dif @xmath393 search from lsnd or from some other experiment , then the oscillation hypothesis will be favored and the allowed region in fig .",

    "the evidence restricting neutrino oscillation parameters is briefly reviewed .",
    "three experiments using the bnl wide - band beam have searched for @xmath394 oscillations .",
    "they are an experiment primarily designed to measure neutrino electron scattering , e734 @xcite , a follow up on a previous indication of neutrino oscillations at the cern ps , e816 @xcite , and a specifically designed long baseline oscillation experiment , e776 @xcite .",
    "the bnl neutrino beam is a horn focused beam composed mainly of @xmath36 and @xmath1 from pion and kaon dif .",
    "the principal @xmath17 background for all of the experiments comes from the pion - muon decay sequence and from charged and neutral kaon decay .",
    "integrated over the entire spectrum , this @xmath17 flux is about 1% of the @xmath36 flux with a minimum @xmath17 flux of about 0.6% near a neutrino energy of 1 gev .",
    "each experiment also has a photon background from @xmath395 production , where one @xmath5 is confused as an electron and where the second @xmath5 is not seen .",
    "the first two experiments separate photons by observing the primary vertex and using the spatial separation of the photon from this primary vertex to distinguish electrons and photons .",
    "the third experiment relies on a monte carlo method to calculate the background from @xmath395 production . in each case",
    ", the systematic errors dominate the limits reported by e734 and e776 , as shown in figs . 30 and 34a .",
    "the difference in limits in fig .",
    "34a is almost completely accounted for by the different distances from the target ( e734 is at 120 m and e776 at 1000 m from the neutrino source ) because the beam is common to both measurements .",
    "the e816 experiment observed an excess of electron events @xmath396 times that expected .",
    "the average e816 neutrino energy was about 1.2 gev , although individual electron event energies were not reported .",
    "the ccfr experiment @xcite provides the most stringent limit on @xmath397 oscillations near @xmath398 , but their limits are not as restrictive as e776 for values of @xmath399 ev@xmath20 .",
    "the karmen experiment @xcite has searched for @xmath393 oscillations using neutrinos from pion dar .",
