    "an important issue in finite - temperature lattice qcd is the determination of the nature of the chiral phase transition for a realistic spectrum of light up and down quarks and a heavier strange quark . despite its importance , past",
    "studies of this `` 2 + 1 '' case have been few . for the kogut - susskind action ,",
    "all of them have been made around 1990@xcite .",
    "it was found in these studies that the chiral phase transition changes from a first - order transition to a crossover as the strange quark mass @xmath4 increases beyond a critical value @xmath5 for a fixed degenerate up and down quark mass @xmath6 , in agreement with predictions of an effective @xmath3 model of qcd@xcite .",
    "results were also obtained@xcite which indicate the physical point of quark masses to lie in the region of crossover on the @xmath7 plane .",
    "however , these results were based on simulations made at only a few sets of quark masses . clearly a more extensive study is called for to have a full understanding of the phase structure in the 2-parameter space of @xmath7 . here",
    "we report first results from our recent effort toward this goal .",
    "an interesting suggestion from a @xmath3 model analysis@xcite is that the second - order transition expected at the critical strange quark mass @xmath5 is in the ising universality class , with the massless mode provided by the @xmath3 meson .",
    "a novel feature of our work is a study of the screening mass of @xmath3 to examine this point .",
    "our simulations are performed for the temporal lattice size @xmath0 .",
    "an @xmath8 lattice is employed to make a survey of the phase structure varying @xmath9 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 . a detailed investigation",
    "is then made along the flavor @xmath10 symmetric line @xmath2 by another series of simulations on a @xmath11 and a @xmath12 lattice .",
    "for each parameter set , ( 12)@xmath13 trajectories of unit length are generated by the hybrid r algorithm .",
    "we show the result of our phase diagram analysis on an @xmath15 lattice in fig .  [",
    "fig : diag ] . at @xmath16 a clear two - state signal",
    "is obtained by a comparison of runs with a hot and a cold start . at triangle points",
    ", we find a very sharp change of observables over a narrow range of @xmath9 , suggestive of a first - order transition , while only a smooth crossover is seen at diamond points .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we plot results for the chiral condensate along the line @xmath17 on a @xmath18 lattice ( @xmath19 ) or a @xmath20 lattice ( @xmath21 ) . on these lattices",
    "a two - state signal is found , which is clear at @xmath22 and 0.025 , but less so at @xmath23 .",
    "the behavior above @xmath24 , on the other hand , indicates a crossover .",
    "the results taken together suggest that the critical line marking the end point of the first - order transition runs above the triangle points at @xmath25 , and below the point @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] , which is indicated by the shaded line .",
    "if we assume @xmath27  mev for the critical temperature , the physical point is located at the cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] , which is in the region of crossover .",
    "our results are in agreement with those of the columbia group obtained at @xmath28 on a @xmath18 lattice@xcite .",
    "we now discuss results along the line @xmath17 . given our observation of a two - state signal at @xmath29 , one way to estimate the value of the critical mass @xmath30 is to extrapolate the gap of the chiral condensate @xmath31 toward larger @xmath32 where it vanishes . employing the form @xmath33 predicted by the mean - field analysis of the @xmath3 model",
    ", we find @xmath34 .",
    "if we use a naive linear extrapolation , we obtain @xmath35 .",
    "a similar value @xmath36 was previously reported@xcite by a linear extrapolation applied to old results@xcite .    in the region of crossover @xmath37",
    ", we expect the peak height of the chiral susceptibility @xmath38 to develop a singular behavior @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "we calculate @xmath38 for @xmath41 with the histogram reweighting method .",
    "assuming @xmath42 , we fit the peak height to the form above .",
    "a reasonable fit with @xmath43 is obtained with the value of the exponent @xmath44 , which is comparable to the ising value @xmath45 and the mean - field value 2/3 .    in order to examine the screening mass @xmath46 of @xmath3 meson",
    ", we employ @xmath47 random source and no gauge fixing to evaluate the two quark loop contribution of the @xmath3 propagator .",
    "good results are obtained for the full @xmath3 propagator with this method as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the quark mass dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath3 screening masses for @xmath19 , where we find a first - order transition , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath49 decreases toward zero as @xmath32 increases toward the critical value , both on the confined and the deconfined side of the transition , in contrast to @xmath50 which increases .",
    "= 7.0 cm    assuming a linear quark mass dependence , @xmath51 , predicted by the mean - field analysis of the @xmath3 model , we obtain @xmath52 in the confining phase and @xmath53 in the deconfining phase .",
    "these values are consistent with each other , and are also in agreement with the estimate from a square root extrapolation of the gap of @xmath54 discussed above .",
    "these results indicate vanishing of the @xmath3 mass at the critical quark mass as suggested by the @xmath3 model@xcite .",
    "results for larger quark masses ( @xmath21 ) , where a crossover behavior is seen , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) .",
    "while @xmath55 decreases toward smaller values of @xmath32 , the variation is too mild to attempt an independent estimate of @xmath30 . an interesting point which requires",
    "clarification is that @xmath55 stays considerably small compared to @xmath50 even for large quark masses .",
    "our study with the kogut - susskind action supports the previous conclusion with this action that there is no finite - temperature phase transition for three flavors of quarks with physical masses .",
    "this means that a discrepancy with the conclusion from the wilson action@xcite still remains .",
