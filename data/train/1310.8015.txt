    "the quasiparticle wave packets are coherent superpositions of electrons and holes .",
    "this results in a characteristic size of the wave packets which is much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "the charge of the packets depends on the energy and can be very different from the electron charge @xmath3 .",
    "this has important consequences in electronic transport properties of superconductor - insulator - normal metal junctions .",
    "transport properties of s - wave superconductor - insulator - normal metal junctions have been the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical research for decades , see for example , refs .  .",
    "in this case the cooper pairs can be constructed from the two single particle wave functions related by a time reversal operation . at low temperatures the characteristic size of wave packets which carry current in the metal near the boundary is of the order of the normal metal coherence length @xmath5 , which turns out to be much larger than the elastic mean free path @xmath0 . here @xmath6 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath7 is the temperature .",
    "one of the consequences of the large size of the wave packets is that , in the presence of a current through the junction , the drop of the gauge - invariant potential @xmath8 is pushed to distances of order @xmath9 away from the boundary , which is much larger than both the thickness of the insulator and the elastic mean free path @xmath0 .",
    "this is quite different from the case of normal metal - insulator - normal metal junctions , where most of the potential drop occurs at the insulator .    in this article",
    "we develop a theory of electron transport in p - wave superconductor - insulator - normal metal junctions .",
    "the best known example of a p - wave superfluid is superfluid @xmath10 .",
    "one of the leading candidates for p - wave pairing in electronic systems is @xmath11 .",
    "there are numerous pieces of experimental evidence that the superconducting state of this material has odd parity , breaks time reversal symmetry and is fully gaped.@xcite one of the simplest forms of the order parameter which satisfies these requirements is the chiral p - wave state @xmath12 , which has been suggested in ref .  .",

    "is forbidden .",
    "thus , similar to the s - wave case , the resistance of the junction is determined by the tunneling of the electron pairs .",
    "coherent pair tunneling gives rise to coherence between electrons and holes inside the normal metal .",
    "electron - hole coherence in the metal is characterized by the anomalous green function .",
    "the crucial difference between the s - wave and the p - wave cases is the following . in the p - wave case in the absence of spin - orbit interaction only the p - wave component is induced inside the normal metal .",
    "the latter is exponentially suppressed at distances larger than @xmath0 away from the superconductor - normal metal boundary . as a result , in the diffusive regime the conductance of the junction is significantly suppressed . in the presence of the spin - orbit interaction the p - wave order parameter in the superconductor",
    "is partially converted to the s - wave component inside the normal metal . at low temperatures ,",
    "the s - wave component propagates into the metal to large distances from the boundary .",
    "consequently , it is this component that determines the low temperature resistance of the system .",
    "we show below that rashba - type spin - orbit coupling at the boundary between the normal metal and the p - wave superconductor leads to strong dependence of the resistance on the direction of the vector @xmath1 , which characterizes the spin structure of the order parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) . since the spin orientation of the order parameter may be controlled by an external magnetic field@xcite our predictions may be tested in experiment .",

    "this condensate fraction corresponds to the the components of the vector @xmath15 lying in the xy - plane .",

    "qualitatively , this suppression is related to the fact that , due to proximity effect , at low energies the quasiparticle wave functions in metal are a coherent superposition of electron and hole wave functions , and the effective charge of the quasiparticles approaches zero at @xmath275 .",
