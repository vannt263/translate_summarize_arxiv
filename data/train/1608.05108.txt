    "[ [ section ] ]    understanding the physics underlying the qcd phase diagram remains a challenge . while at low chemical potentials lattice qcd has provided many answers @xcite , at high densities , effective models @xcite have been the source of most accomplishments . in order to rule out unreasonable propositions , experimental ( at low densities ) and observational ( at high densities ) constraints",
    "have been used as in @xcite .",
    "two of the most reliable constraints at high densities are the two - solar masses neutron stars ( ns ) detected in this decade , psr j1614 - 2230  @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432  @xcite . before them , effective models which provided maximum stellar masses larger than 1.44 @xmath0 were acceptable @xcite , but this is no longer the reality and many revisions in the theory underlying neutron star physics have been performed lately .    [ [ section-1 ] ]    the _ hyperon puzzle _ has then started to play a central role in the understanding of neutron star composition : while hyperons are energetically favoured , they soften the equation of state ( eos ) and the existence of massive ns requires stiff eoss .",
    "this implies that the hyperon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon interactions must be strongly repulsive at high hyperonic densities .",
    "meanwhile , many hypernuclei have been synthesised and recent analyses of double-@xmath1 hypernuclei suggests an attraction , though small , in the in the @xmath2 channel @xcite . to fulfill these different requirements ,",
    "it has become evident that one has to go beyond simple su(6 ) symmetry arguments to fix hyperon couplings , and more elaborate models have to be considered@xcite .    in the framework of relativistic mean field models ( rmf ) , this is achieved by the inclusion of strange scalar and vector mesons @xcite mediating the nuclear force alongside the usual scalar - isoscalar @xmath3 or @xmath4 , vector - isoscalar @xmath5 and vector - isovector @xmath6 mesons . in the case of the inclusion of the strange mesons , the scalar one normally labelled @xmath7 or @xmath8 and the vector labelled @xmath9 , coupling constants between them and the baryons are also necessary and they are usually fixed with a certain degree of arbitrariness .",
    "we discuss this point in greater detail when the formalism is introduced in the next section , but at this point it is necessary to emphasise that fixing them in a less hand - waving way as possible would be desirable .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in a recent paper @xcite the possible existence of a liquid - gas phase transition was investigated with the help of rmf models in a neutron-@xmath1 and neutron - proton-@xmath1 ( np-@xmath1 ) matter , whose meson - baryon coupling constants were allowed to vary in a broad space , but restricted to satisfy known nucleon-@xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath11 ) potentials .",
    "the first one was fixed to be @xmath12 mev at nuclear saturation density and the second one was fixed as @xmath13 mev at one fifth of the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath14 ) , a reasonably recent proposition @xcite inspired by experimental results .",
    "notice that this value refers to a potential with low attractiveness , contrary to another choice commonly used in the literature that forsees this potential as @xmath15 mev also at @xmath14 @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", only two couplings could be taken as free parameters because the coupling between the @xmath16 meson and the @xmath1 ( @xmath17 ) becomes constrained by the coupling between the @xmath3 meson and the @xmath1 ( @xmath18 ) and the coupling between the @xmath19 meson and the @xmath1 ( @xmath20 ) constrained by the coupling between the @xmath7 meson and the @xmath1 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the first constraint shows that the increase of the @xmath18 makes the potential more attractive at low densities and more repulsive at high densities .",
    "this conclusion had already been drawn in former studies , as for instance , in @xcite . in a similar way",
    ", the increase of @xmath22 also increases the repulsion at high densities .",
    "then , the instabilities in the systems were investigated according to these restrictions and spinodal curves were observed , showing a clear liquid - gas phase transition at low densities , which was confirmed by the instability analysis of an ab - initio calculation @xcite where no free parameters can be tuned .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    at supersaturation densities , the investigation of a possible transition from a strange - poor to a strange - rich matter is also of great importance in the studies of compact star constituents . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that non - relativistic skyrme functionals can produce one - body potentials compatible with hyper - nuclear data , fulfil the @xmath23 neutron star constraint , and still present a complex phase diagram with first and second order phase transitions .",
    "these instabilities persist at finite temperature , with important potential consequences on the supernova collapse dynamics and the neutrino transport .",
    "the existence of a strangeness driven phase transition is however clearly model dependent .",
    "another recent work shed some light on the role played by the hyperon - meson coupling constants ( including strange mesons ) in stellar macroscopic properties and the relation between results that are consistent with observational values and the hyperon - hyperon potentials @xcite . in this work ,",
    "four different rmf parameterisations were used and it was concluded that high mass neutron stars and not too large radii are possible to obtain from an eos containing a substantial amount of hyperons , but the results depend a lot on the not yet known hyperon - hyperon channels . the onset order of hyperons were also shown to once again depend drastically on the parameterisation and hyperon - meson coupling choices . in this work",
    "no such instability is present , unless unrealistically high values for the attractive couplings are imposed  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the observed instabilities might be a pathology of skyrme functionals .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    in the present work , we extend the analysis of ref.@xcite to a systematic study of the parameter space , searching for possible instabilities that could give rise to a strangeness driven phase transition .",
    "towards this search , the @xmath18 and @xmath21 are left as free parameters .",
    "the other two couplings , @xmath17 and @xmath20 are constrained by the potentials mentioned above , in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "once a large region of couplings is spanned , we revisit stellar matter in @xmath24-equilibrium and electrically neutral at zero and finite temperature and recalculate protoneutron and neutron stars macroscopic quantities from equations of state ( eos ) that include strange mesons and where the couplings between hyperons and mesons are chosen as mentioned above .",
    "we then confront stellar matter properties results obtained from the phenomenological potentials and compare with results previously published in the literature .    concerning the instability issue",
    ", the result is that the whole rmf @xmath25 unconstrained parameter space is thermodynamically stable .",
    "this leads to the strong conclusion that , within the rmf formalism , the only possibility to have a strangeness phase transition is at the quark level .",
    "unfortunately , the final word about ( in)stability of hyperonic matter can not be said , because a very different result is obtained from the instability analysis of the ab - initio afdmc model , within the three - body couplings which were recently shown to be able to correctly fulfill the @xmath23 neutron star constraint .",

    "a choice of couplings based on a mixture of arguments @xcite and on su(3 ) symmetry @xcite have also been done .",
    "if massive stars are to be obtained , the su(6 ) symmetry has to be partially broken and , in this case , strange mesons can couple with the nucleons , influencing nuclear bulk properties and forcing a reparameterisation @xcite . in the present work we avoid the discussion based on group theory and",
    "focus our choice on the @xmath11 phenomenological potential for the meson-@xmath1 couplings .",
    "when the other hyperons are included , we make different choices for their couplings and we discuss this point when the results are presented .",
    "we then choose the hyperon - meson ( strange and non - strange ) coupling constants as in @xcite .",
    "in analogy with what has been done with the @xmath18 when constrained by the hyper - nuclear potential @xmath10 via hyper - nuclear data @xcite , we have constrained the strange meson couplings to the @xmath11 data available in the literature @xcite .",

    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    to investigate the existence of instabilities ,",
    "we rely on the curvature matrix and related spinodal section . a first order phase transition is signaled by an instability or concavity anomaly in the mean - field thermodynamic total energy density .",

    "since the curvature @xmath83 is real and symmetric , its normalised eigenvectors @xmath87 are orthogonal and define a basis in the observable density space .",

    "let us note @xmath89 the minimum eigenvalue at a given point @xmath90 , and @xmath91 the associated eigenvector .",
    "if @xmath92 , then any density fluctuation becomes spontaneously amplified in the direction of the unstable eigenvalue @xmath93 , that is the system spontaneously develops an inhomogeneity between two regions characterised by the particle composition @xmath94 .",
    "the inhomogeneity then amplifies in time according to the mechanism of spinodal decomposition @xcite , until two stable points with all positive eigenvalues ( a dense and a diluted phase ) are reached . at zero temperature",
    "the dilute phase typically corresponds to the vanishing of one or more partial densities @xcite and the instability direction can be approximately identified by the direction of phase separation @xcite . as a consequence , at any density point inside the spinodal",
    ", the density and composition of the two coexisting phases issued from the phase transition can be approximately inferred from the intersection of the unstable eigenvector direction and the spinodal contour , defined by the condition @xmath95 .",
    "if the spinodal region is unbound at high density , the instability can not be cured by phase separation . in that case",
    "the system violates the basic convexity principle of thermodynamics , and the instability has to be considered as a pathology . for a better understanding of the physics underlying strange matter and a comparison with the results obtained at low densities @xcite , we next restrict our study to a simple model containing only neutrons and @xmath1 hyperons . in this simplified case ,",
    "the curvature matrix is reduced to a @xmath96 matrix which can be equivalently expressed in the good quantum number plane @xmath97 or in the rotated frame corresponding to the particle densities @xmath98 .",

    "moreover , we saw that hyperons can coexist with nucleons giving rise to massive stars bearing a radii of the order of 10 - 12 km , compatible with 1.4 @xmath0 stars with radii approximately 10% larger , values which agree with a recent calculation @xcite . when the full octet is allowed to exist ,",
    "the radius tend to decrease .",
    "massive stars can be obtained with a large amount of hyperons as far as strange mesons are included in the formalism , result that helps us to shed some light to the hyperon puzzle .",
    "it is never too much to say again that all these results are parameter and model dependent , what reinforces the need of further contraints at high densities .      as a final remark",
    ", we claim that it would be interesting to confront the values of the coupling constants allowed by the analyses of phenomenological potentials with the values obtained from the assumption of an su(3 ) symmetry done in @xcite when the scalar mesons are included , a work already in progress .",

    "<S> background : :    : the emergence of hyperon degrees of freedom in neutron star matter    has been associated to first order phase transitions in some    phenomenological models , but conclusions on the possible physical    existence of an instability in the strangeness sector are strongly    model dependent . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    : the purpose of the present study is to assess whether strangeness    instabilities are related to specific values of the largely    unconstrained hyperon interactions , and to study the effect of the    strange meson couplings on phenomenological properties of neutron    stars and supernova matter , once these latter are fixed to fulfill the    constraints imposed by hypernuclear data . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    : we consider a phenomenological rmf model sufficiently simple to    allow a complete exploration of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    we show that no instability at supersaturation density exists for the    rmf model , as long as the parameter space is constrained by basic    physical requirements . </S>",
    "<S> this is at variance with a non - relativistic    functional , with a functional behavior fitted through ab - initio    calculations . </S>",
    "<S> once the study is extended to include the full octet , we    show that the parameter space allows reasonable radii for canonical    neutron stars as well as massive stars above two - solar mass , together    with an important strangeness content of the order of 30% , slightly    decreasing with increasing entropy , even in the absence of a    strangeness driven phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    we conclude that the hyperon content of neutron stars and supernova    matter can not be established with present constraints , and is    essentially governed by the unconstrained coupling to the strange    isoscalar meson . </S>"
