    "dna is often circular , and so can be knotted or linked @xcite . to aid in essential cellular tasks ,",
    "many proteins have thus evolved to manipulate the geometry and topology of dna .",
    "important examples of these tasks include : _ replication _ ( creating 2 copies from one double strand of dna ) , _ inversion _ ( inverting a subsequence of dna ) , and _ integration _ and _ deletion _ ( inserting and deleting dna sequences into / from other dna segments ) .",
    "for instance , certain proteins invert crossings of two double strands of dna to unknot or unlink dna @xcite .",
    "it is important for biologists to understand how these proteins operate .",
    "so a model is often generated based on data obtained by experimentally probing a particular system .",
    "for example , if a particular protein can knot or link circular dna , then by running dna through a gel , one can determine the crossing number of the dna knots or links .",
    "one can then use electron microscopy to identify the exact knot or link type  @xcite .    by modelling different regions of the ( possibly knotted ) dna molecule as tangles",
    ", we can describe the protein s action as a change in one of the constituent tangles .",
    "mathematicians can help biologists by finding all tangle combinations that may explain the protein s action .",
    "some of these mathematically possible solutions can then be eliminated through biological considerations .",
    "based on the biological work of wasserman and cozzarelli  @xcite , ernst and sumners developed the tangle model to describe and make predictions  later experimentally verified  about how the protein tn3 interacts with dna @xcite .",
    "the tangle model has since been used to determine specific features of a wide variety of protein - dna interactions ( see for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we will focus on one particular family of proteins that affects dna topology : the integrase family of site - specific recombinases , also known as the tyrosine recombinases . for an overview of this family , see the review of grainge and jayaram  @xcite .",
    "the integrase family includes _ flp _ , @xmath0 _ int _ , and _",
    "cre_. integrases are involved in a wide variety of biological activities , including integrating ( _ i.e. _ , inserting ) a virus dna into a host cell s dna .",
    "integrase proteins have a common biochemical mechanism and share a subsequence of amino acids .",
    "given varying numbers of dna axis self - crossings ( _ supercoils _ ) these proteins can transform unknotted circular dna into a variety of torus knots or links  @xcite .",
    "members of the other family of site - specific recombinases , the serine recombinases , act very differently .",
    "these proteins , such as tn3 , require a fixed number of supercoils .",
    "the protein then cuts and rearranges the dna ( occasionally multiple times ) before releasing it . for several serine recombinases ,",
    "it has been possible to completely solve the tangle model equations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , for integrase proteins , the unbound dna s configuration varies from molecule to molecule , depending on the degree of supercoiling .",
    "further , these proteins act only once before releasing the dna .",
    "so , to model the varying configurations , and its effects on the resulting dna products after a single round of recombination , we must use a larger number of tangles than needed for a serine recombinase . rather than four fixed tangles , a solution to the ( direct or inverted ) system of equations consists of three fixed tangles , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and an indexed family of tangles , @xmath4 .",
    "in general , there are an infinite number of solutions to such a system .",
    "the increased complexity of the tangle model for the integrase family has thus far prevented a full solution to the tangle model .",
    "previous work found solutions by making several assumptions which are thought to be biologically reasonable and which lead to considerable mathematical simplification  @xcite .",
    "we previously considered the tangle model for a generic member of the integrase family  @xcite without any _ a priori _ assumptions on the constituent tangles .",
    "we gave and exemplified three ( topologically motivated ) classes of solutions for @xmath5 and @xmath1 , all of which are valid for both systems .",
    "we then developed dehn surgery arguments to eliminate all ( in the direct system ) or all but one ( in the inverted system ) other possibilities .    in this paper , we now complete the classification of all possible solutions to the systems of equations arising from both the direct and inverted cases .",
    "in particular , we utilize recent work of kronheimer , mrowka , ozsvth and szab  @xcite , and ernst  @xcite to determine the fourth solution in the inverted case .",
    "in addition , we determine all possible solutions for @xmath2 in both the direct and inverted settings . combining the results derived below with our previous work  @xcite",
    ", we obtain a complete classification of all solutions to the equations arising from either of the direct or inverted system :    there are three classes of solutions to the equations that model integrase - mediated dna recombination    [ invdown ] before :  = @xmath6 unknot for @xmath7 + @xmath8 @xmath9 torus link for direct sites + * or * + @xmath10@xmath11 torus knot for inverted sites +    1 .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 are integral tangles .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath3 are integral , @xmath13 for at most one value of @xmath14 , integral for at most two values of @xmath14 and otherwise is vertical or the sum of a vertical plus an integral tangle .",
    "@xmath15 , integral or vertical plus integral .",

    "3 .   @xmath1 and @xmath2 are strictly rational , @xmath3 is integral , and @xmath4 is integral for at most value of @xmath14 and otherwise strictly rational .    for the direct system ,",

    "there is precisely one additional class of solutions :    1 .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath3 is integral , @xmath21 is the prime montesinos tangle @xmath22 and @xmath23 or @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",

    "also note that the only thing that keeps the solutions in class 4 from being solutions in class 2 is tangle @xmath21 .",
    "note that solutions are unique up to compensating negative and positive vertical sums of vertical tangles or horizontal sums of horizontal tangles .",
    "see section 2 for a discussion of these equivalence classes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review some basic facts about tangles , four - plats and their corresponding double branch covers . in section 3 we provide the biological motivation and background for our work : the action of an integrase on dna with either inverted or direct repeats .",
    "we also present the generalization of ernst and sumners mathematical model in terms of tangles and four - plats  @xcite . in section 4",
    "we focus on the inverted system . here",
    "we harness recent results of kronheimer , mrowka , ozsvth and szab  @xcite and ernst  @xcite to limit the possibilites for @xmath21 , and then determine the complete fourth solution .    in section  [ solns ]",
    "we present examples of all classes of solutions to these tangle equations , including the novel inverted solution .",
    "we conclude with some remarks on the biological relevance of our model and solutions , as well as possible directions for future ( biological and mathematical ) work .",
    "we begin by recalling a few elementary facts about tangles .",
    "( for a more comprehensive introduction to tangles , see  @xcite and @xcite ) . a _ tangle _",
    "@xmath26 is a pair @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a 3-ball with a given boundary parametrization with four distinguished boundary points labelled nw , ne , sw , se , and @xmath29 consists of a pair of properly embedded unoriented arcs with endpoints nw , ne , sw and se .",
    "we say two tangles @xmath30 and @xmath31 are _ equivalent _ if there exists an isotopy taking @xmath30 to @xmath31 , which remains the identity on @xmath32 .",
    "tangles can be divided into three mutually exclusive families : locally knotted , rational and prime .",
    "a tangle is _ locally knotted _",
    "if there exists a sphere in @xmath28 meeting @xmath29 transversely in 2 points such that the 2-ball bounded by the sphere intersects @xmath29 in a knotted spanning arc .",
    "locally knotted tangles have reducible double branch covers ( branching over @xmath29 ) .    we note that locally knotted tangles do not occur in our context since the dna molecule starts off unknotted , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 can not be locally knotted .",
    "suppose @xmath2 were locally knotted , with @xmath33 be a sphere bounding a ball @xmath31 containing the locally knotted arc .",
    "then , since every product is a prime knot , @xmath34 must be an unknotted arc , for all @xmath14 .",
    "but this implies that @xmath35 for @xmath36 , a contradiction .",
    "so none of the constituent tangles are locally knotted .",
    "_ rational _ tangles are the second family ; they are so called because their equivalence classes are in one - to - one correspondence with the extended rational numbers ( @xmath37 ) via a continued fraction expansion , as first constructed by conway  @xcite .",
    "( see  @xcite for nice classifications . ) a tangle whose corresponding rational number is @xmath38 will be denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "rational tangles are formed by an alternating series of horizontal and vertical half - twists of two ( initially untwisted ) parallel arcs ( and hence are freely isotopic to them ) .",
    "any continued fraction decomposition of @xmath40 yields a finite list of integers @xmath41 $ ] which tell us how to twist the strands around each other to get a diagram of the tangle .",
    "the @xmath42 tangle corresponds to two untwisted horizontal arcs ( one joining ne to nw and one joining se to sw ) , whereas the @xmath17 tangle corresponds to two untwisted vertical arcs .",
    "the double branch cover of a rational tangle is a solid torus .",
    "all locally unknotted , non - rational tangles are _ prime_. the double branch cover branched over @xmath29 of a prime tangle is irreducible and has incompressible boundary  @xcite .",
    "bleiler demonstrated that the minimal prime tangle has a minimal projection with five crossings  @xcite .",
    "there are several operations one can perform on tangles .",
    "we concentrate on three .",
    "the first operation forms a knot or 2-component link from a given tangle @xmath30 : the _ numerator closure _ , @xmath43 .",
    "this adds an unknotted arc joining the northern endpoints , and another unknotted arc joining the southern endpoints , or equivalently , the boundary of @xmath30 and @xmath42 are identified so that @xmath44 is identified with @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the second operation , _ tangle sum _ , takes a pair of tangles @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and , under certain restrictions , yields a third tangle , @xmath47 , by identifying the eastern hemispheric boundary disk of @xmath30 with the western one of @xmath31 in such a way that @xmath48 is identified with @xmath49 and @xmath50 is identified with @xmath51 . note that the ( 0 ) tangle is the identity under this operation : @xmath52 . beware that under tangle addition",
    ", we can not distinguish between @xmath53 added to @xmath54 and @xmath30 added to @xmath31 .",
    "thus although tangle summands are written in their simplest form , they are unique only up to an arbitrary number of compensating positive and negative horizontal twists .",
    "the last operation is the _ vertical sum _",
    "@xmath55 , which takes two tangles @xmath30 and @xmath31 and , under certain restrictions , yields a third tangle , @xmath56 , by identifying the southern hemispheric boundary disk of @xmath30 with the northern hemispheric boundary disk of @xmath31 in such a way that @xmath57 is identified with @xmath58 and @xmath59 is identified with @xmath60 .",
    "note that under the numerator closure operation , given two tangles @xmath30 and @xmath31 , although @xmath61 in fact@xmath62 . also , @xmath63 .",
    "as with horizontal tangle sums , we can not distinguish between these two cases .",
    "thus although tangle solutions are written in the simplest form for a given equivalence class , they are unique only up to an arbitrary number of compensating positive and negative vertical twists .    a particular class of prime tangles is obtained by tangle sum of rational tangles and will be of interest to us : _ montesinos _ tangles  @xcite .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath64 to denote the montesinos tangle obtained by the tangle sum of the rational ( possibly integral ) tangles @xmath65 , @xmath66 . a tangle that is ambient isotopic to a sum of rational tangles called _ a generalized montesinos tangle_.",
    "since the sum of a rational tangle and an integral tangle yields a rational tangle  @xcite , a montesinos ( non - rational ) tangle must have at least two non - integral summands .",
    "the numerator closure of a rational tangle yields a _ four - plat _ , a knot or 2-component link that admits a projection consisting of a braid on 4 strings , with one strand free of crossings  @xcite .",
    "given two rational tangles @xmath39 and @xmath67 then @xmath68 iff @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus given a 4-plat , we can write it as the numerator closure of a rational tangle that is unique up to the relationship above .",
    "( see  @xcite for a classification of rational knots . )",
    "schubert showed that all four - plats are prime knots  @xcite . a four - plat obtained by the numerator closure of @xmath39 is written as @xmath71 .",
    "for example , we can write the unknot as @xmath72 , and the trefoil as @xmath73 .      if @xmath26 is a tangle",
    ", then @xmath74 will mean the double cover of @xmath28 , branched over @xmath29 . in general , we will write @xmath75 to denote the three - manifold that is the double cover of @xmath76 branched over the set @xmath77 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the ( compact , connected and orientable ) three - manifolds that arise as double branch covers of tangles or four - plats .",
    "if @xmath1 is a rational tangle , then @xmath78 is a solid torus , which we will denote by @xmath79 .",
    "schubert showed that @xmath80 is the lens space @xmath81 .",
    "two four - plats @xmath71 and @xmath82 are equivalent if and only if their corresponding double branch covers , the lens spaces @xmath81 and @xmath83 , are homeomorphic  @xcite , so @xmath84 if and only if @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "( see rolfsen  @xcite , for a good introduction to lens spaces . )    a summing disk of a tangle ( either the western or eastern summing one ) lifts to an annulus on the boundary of the double branch cover .",
    "this annulus can be _ meridional _ ( its core bounds a meridional disk of the solid torus ) , _ longitudinal _ ( its core intersects a meridian once ) or neither ( intersects a meridian more than once ) .",
    "when two tangles are summed , this corresponds to gluing two solid tori along the annuli that are lifts of the summing disks .",
    "hence , a natural subdivision of rational tangles arises : we say a rational tangle is _ integral _ , and write it as @xmath87 , if it consists of a series of @xmath88 horizontal half - twists , where @xmath89 .",
    "we denote this class as @xmath90 .",
    "integral tangles have summing disks that lift to longitudinal annuli . similarly , a tangle is the infinity tangle , denoted by @xmath17 , if it consists of two vertical parallel strands with no twists .",
    "the infinity tangle has a summing disk that lifts to a meridional annulus .",
    "we say a tangle is _ strictly rational _ , and denote this class as @xmath91 if it is neither integral nor the infinity tangle , and so @xmath92 .",
    "strictly rational tangles have summing disks that lift to annuli that are neither meridional nor longitudinal . within the class of strictly rational tangles we distinguish _ vertical _ tangles , written as @xmath93 , which consists of a series of @xmath88 vertical half - twists ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "we can now describe in full detail a generalization  @xcite of the original tangle model of ernst and sumners  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate our model with a member the integrase family of recombinases , the protein _ flp _ ( pronounced ` flip ' ) .",
    "flp has served as the paradigm for site - specific recombination @xcite , and there are a number of proteins ( including cre , and @xmath0 int acting on lr sites ) whose products are , topologically speaking , identical to those of flp .    roughly speaking ,",
    "flp recognizes two copies of a specific dna sequence , binds at these sites , cuts the dna at the sites , moves the strands in space , reseals the break , and releases the dna .",
    "when acting on circular dna , flp can change the underlying knot type of the dna , for example turning the unknot into the trefoil knot .",
    "the distribution of knot / link products should reflect the supercoiling density @xcite .",
    "we call a dna molecule that has not been acted on by flp a _ substrate _ , and a molecule that has been acted on a _ product_. in these terms , the substrate is always an unknot and the products are torus knots or links .",
    "we model each of the substrates and products as the numerator closure of the sum of three tangles .",
    "each tangle arc represents a segment of double - stranded dna . in the tangle model pioneered by ernst and sumners  @xcite ,",
    "the cutting and joining of dna is assumed to be completely localized : two of the tangles are unchanged by the action of the protein . in the substrate ,",
    "the first tangle , @xmath1 ( @xmath1arental ) , represents two short identical sites that flp recognizes and to which it chemically binds and then cuts , rearranges and re - seals .",
    "this action can be thought of as removing @xmath1 and replacing it with a new tangle , @xmath2 ( @xmath2ecombinant ) , in the product .",
    "the second tangle , @xmath3 , represents the part of the dna that is physically constrained , but unchanged , by the protein ( @xmath95 stands for outside and @xmath96 for constrained ) .",
    "the last tangle , @xmath4 , represents the part of the dna that is free ( hence the subscript @xmath97 ) from protein binding constraints .",
    "@xmath4 can vary depending on the amount of dna supercoiling present at the time flp acts .",
    "the superscript @xmath14 indexes these different possibilities .    in terms of tangles",
    ", this amounts to saying that our substrate and products can be modelled as :    this is as long= @xmath98 + @xmath99    where @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath4 varies as @xmath14 varies , so we obtain different products , as described below .",
    "we use @xmath100 to mean the part unchanged by flp , that is , @xmath101 . when there is no mathematical distinction between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , we use @xmath102 and @xmath103 to represent them interchangeably , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath104 .",
    "recall that , in contrast to integrases , proteins in the serine family of recombinases , such as tn3 , require a fixed number of supercoils before they begin cutting and rejoining dna .",
    "once this requirement is met , they rearrange the dna , occasionally multiple times , before releasing it .",
    "the corresponding tangle equations : from substrate @xmath105 to products @xmath106 , were first solved ( _ i.e. _ , all constituent tangles have been characterized , given the 4-plats ) by ernst and sumners  @xcite . note that the free part , @xmath107 , does not vary .",
    "this single , fixed @xmath107 is what has thus far made the serine recombinase tangle equations more tractable than the integrases , whose equations involve a family of tangles @xmath4 , indexed by @xmath14 .",
    "flp identifies two short identical sequences , called _ repeats _",
    ", on a molecule of dna .",
    "these sites are non - palindromic sequences , and can thus be given an orientation , and hence on circular dna , the strings can be in head to head ( _ inverted repeats _ ) or head to tail ( _ direct repeats _ ) orientation .",
    "action on inverted repeats on a circular molecule of dna yields a knot , and action on direct repeats yields a two - component link .",
    "when flp acts on dna it yields a variety of torus knots ( inverted repeats ) and links ( direct repeats ) that depend on @xmath4 .",
    "when flp acts on a dna molecule with inverted sites , experiments have shown that the resulting dna can be an unknot ( with a different dna sequence ) , or a knot with up to 11 crossings @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have obtained images ( using electron microscopy ) of the simplest products , and has shown that they are the torus knots @xmath108 ( the unknot ) , primarily positive @xmath73 and exclusively positive @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "this experimental evidence indicates that flp begins with an unknotted dna substrate with inverted repeats , @xmath108 and converts it via tangle surgery into a torus knot @xmath110 , where @xmath7 .",
    "( the chirality of the products for @xmath111 and @xmath112 has not been determined for all members of the integrase family , so we remain in the general situation .",
    "corollary [ chiral ] considers the specific setting for flp ( and @xmath0 int acting on lr sites ) , whose products handedness are known . )",
    "we thus model the action of flp on dna with inverted repeats as :    [ invdown ] before :  = @xmath113 unknot , for  @xmath7 + @xmath114 unknot    ' '' ''     + @xmath115 torus knot for  @xmath116    ' '' ''    when flp acts on a dna molecule with direct sites , experiments have shown that the resulting dna can be an unlink , or a 2-component link with up to 10 crossings  @xcite .",
    "electrophoretic gels have determined that the simplest products are @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "this experimental evidence indicates that flp begins with an unknotted dna substrate with direct repeats , @xmath108 and converts it via tangle surgery into a torus link @xmath120 , where @xmath116 .",
    "we thus model the action of flp on dna with direct repeats as :    [ invdown ] before :  = before : @xmath113 unknot ,  @xmath7 + after:@xmath121 unlink    ' '' ''     + @xmath122 torus link for  @xmath116    ' '' ''      given the set of tangle equations above , whose products ( 4-plats ) are known , the goal is to determine the constituent tangles .",
    "the interplay of tangles and four - plats with their corresponding double branch covers is the key to many of our results in tangle calculus .",
    "for instance , if @xmath123 and @xmath124 are tangles , and @xmath124 is a rational tangle , then the @xmath125 is obtained by gluing @xmath126 and @xmath127 along annuli that are the lifts of their corresponding gluing disks .",
    "if @xmath124 is integral , then the gluing annulus is boundary reducible , and @xmath128 .",
    "the sum and subsequent numerator closure of two tangles @xmath123 and @xmath124 induces a gluing of the boundaries of their respective double branch covers @xmath126 and @xmath129 . if @xmath130 yields a four - plat @xmath71 , then @xmath131 must be the lens space @xmath81 , where @xmath132 is the map that takes @xmath133 to @xmath134 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath123 and @xmath124 are both rational , @xmath135 and @xmath127 are solid tori , and they form a heegaard splitting @xmath136 of @xmath81 .    replacing tangle @xmath1 in @xmath137 by tangle @xmath2 to obtain @xmath138 is called _ tangle surgery_. if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are rational tangles , then tangle surgery corresponds to replacing @xmath79 with @xmath139 in the double branch cover , and thus corresponds to different dehn fillings of @xmath140 . in the case of @xmath141 , the unknot , then since @xmath142is @xmath76 , and the tangle surgery corresponds to dehn surgery on a knot complement ( @xmath100 ) in @xmath76 . if @xmath100 is not rational , then the knot is non - trivial .    previous work ( ernst and sumners  @xcite , and the authors @xcite via different techniques for @xmath2 ) proved that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are rational for both direct and inverted repeats .",
    "so the tangle surgery of replacing @xmath1 with @xmath2 corresponds to dehn surgery in the double branch covers .",
    "thus the strategy is to use restrictions on the type of dehn surgeries of @xmath143 that yield lens spaces .",
    "this in turn restricts the possible tangle solutions .",
    "in  @xcite , we asked whether there were any solutions in the single remaining open inverted case : @xmath1 rational , @xmath102 integral , @xmath103 prime ( and hence @xmath101 prime ) .",
    "we now can give a positive answer for @xmath112 and eliminate this case for all other @xmath14 .    in this section , we consider only the inverted system , as we previously completely classified the direct system  @xcite .",
    "we begin by restricting the possibilities for @xmath100 , in part by harnessing a powerful recent result of kronheimer , mrowka , ozsvth and szab :    [ kmos ] if @xmath77 is a knot in @xmath76 , such that for some @xmath144 , @xmath145 is a lens space where @xmath146 , then @xmath77 must either be the unknot or the trefoil knot .    in the inverted repeats system ,",

    "gordon  @xcite and moser  @xcite have classified all surgeries on a generic torus knot @xmath156 complement that yield lens spaces : @xmath157 iff @xmath158 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that only @xmath159 can be obtained from a torus knot  the trefoil knot @xmath160 .",
    "it now remains only to rule out the possibility of @xmath140 being hyperbolic .",
    "assume @xmath140 is a hyperbolic knot ( @xmath77 ) complement .",
    "then by the cyclic surgery theorem  @xcite , the surgery slope must be integral , and in fact must be @xmath161 , since @xmath162 . in our setting ,",
    "the integral surgery slope @xmath161 is strictly less than @xmath163 , since @xmath164 .",
    "hence , we can apply corollary 8.4 of  @xcite , and obtain that @xmath140 must be a solid torus or a trefoil knot complement , neither of which is hyperbolic .",

    "the integrase family of recombinases is forgiving of substrates  these members will perform recombination between two sites on the same ( circular , as discussed here , or linear ) or different ( circular and/or linear ) molecules .",
    "however , if an integrase requires a particular alignment of the two sites when they are brought together , then a substrate with inverted sites may have a different number of crossings introduced into @xmath95 than a substrate with direct sites .",
    "( for example , it was shown that flp aligns the sites in antiparallel , and so in the simplest case , @xmath393 for inverted and @xmath42 for direct @xcite . ) biologically , the unequal number of solutions between the inverted and direct cases means that the fourth case is not likely , as this would mean that @xmath100 differs not only in the number of crossings but in the actual type of tangle ( prime versus rational ) .",
    "this would in turn imply a different mechanism for bringing the sites together depending whether they are in direct or inverted repeats ( only for one product , corresponding to @xmath112 ) . a small protein being able to `` sense ''",
    "the global orientation ( inverted versus direct ) of the two sites would be unusual . however , there are examples of proteins which act in response to global characteristics , notably topoisomerase ii , which preferentially changes crossings to _ _ un__knot dna  @xcite .",
    "electron microscopy images by crisona and colleagues determine that for flp in the cases @xmath261 and @xmath112 , the products are in fact torus knots  @xcite .",
    "for the related recombinase , @xmath0 integrase acting on lr or pb sites , electron microscopy has shown that the products are almost exclusively positive torus knots ( inverted ) and negative torus links ( direct )  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "biologically , one would expect a fixed , precise mechanism for this family of recombinases , which would predict that for flp and other integrases , every product should be a torus knot or link .",
    "however , although one can experimentally demonstrate that higher - crossing products exist and determine their respective crossing number , their precise knot / link type has not been experimentally verified for any other integrase family member .",
    "as the crossing number increases , resolving the precise knot type becomes more crucial ( and difficult ) since the number of knots with a given crossing number increases dramatically  for instance , there are 1,701,936 knots with @xmath394 16 crossings @xcite",
    ".      if they are , one might be able develop similar dehn surgery arguments such as the result from  @xcite used here to restrict @xmath100 .",
    "for example , for @xmath397 , we can eliminate the possibility of @xmath100 having as double branch cover a satellite knot complement by work of bleiler and litherland  @xcite , and , in many cases , a torus knot complement by moser and gordon @xcite .",
    "so in many cases , the first step would be to consider @xmath100 such that @xmath140 is a hyperbolic knot complement .",
    "second , we consider the chirality of the resulting products .",
    "have characterized the first two nontrivial products of flp - mediated inversion as almost exclusively positive torus knots @xcite .",
    "third , although the third class of solutions is mathematically possible , biological considerations such as dna s stiffness impeding a high number of crossings , make them biologically unlikely . for this reason",
    ", biologists often assume in the tangle model that @xmath1 and @xmath2 each have 0 or 1 crossings",
    ".    other work , notably  @xcite and  @xcite , have incorporated a number of biologically reasonable assumptions into the tangle model which reduce the number of putative tangle solutions .",
    "for example the generalized random collision assumes that the original dna is exclusively negatively supercoiled ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath398 or @xmath399 for @xmath400 ) , which then in turn restricts @xmath3 and @xmath1  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these assumptions are biologically reasonable , and preclude tangle solutions such as those of class 3 . but",
    "topologically , the more exotic cases can not be excluded .",
    "if the number of crossings of the constituent tangles can be bounded with any degree of certainty , this reduces the solutions from an infinite number to a mere handful .",
    "for example , we consider the serine recombinase xer acting on circular dna with direct _ psi _ sites , whose corresponding tangle equations are @xmath401 and @xmath402  @xcite . assuming all tangles are rational and @xmath217 , and so @xmath403 , then darcy showed that @xmath404  @xcite .",
    "additionally , vazquez _ et al _ , by carefully analyzing the biological data , and assuming any nontrivial topology is in @xmath3 , show @xmath1 is trivial ( and hence in their setting can be chosen to be @xmath42 ) , and show @xmath95 is rational using techniques similar to @xcite .",
    "further they assume @xmath2 is integral or @xmath405 , and show there exist 3 solutions : @xmath406 or @xmath407 or @xmath408 , which can be biologically equivalent @xcite .",
    "additionally given torus link substrates constructed by @xmath0 int , xer - mediated recombination results in more complex knots : @xmath409 , and @xmath410 seven - crossing product ( knot ) , and @xmath411 @xmath412 nine - crossing product  @xcite .",
    "darcy also uses this information to analyze how differing seven - crossing products reduce the number of putative solutions  @xcite .",
    "question 4 _ can the precise type of knot resulting in the action of xer on @xmath413 be determined ? can similar techniques to those used here be used to examine the xer system in their full generality , without simplifying assumptions ? _",
    "finally , we reiterate that , although we have motivated our work by considering flp , our results can be applied to any protein in the integrase family , such as cre or @xmath0 int ( acting on lr sites ) , whose products are the above torus knots or links .    acknowledgements .",

    "<S> integrase proteins acting on circular double - stranded dna often change its topology by transforming unknotted circles into torus knots and links . </S>",
    "<S> two systems of tangle equations  corresponding to the two initial dna sequences  arise when modelling this transformation : direct and inverted .    with no _ a priori _ assumptions on the constituent tangles , we utilize dehn surgery arguments to completely classify the tangle solutions for each of the two systems . </S>",
    "<S> a key step is to combine work of our previous paper @xcite with recent results of kronheimer , mrowka , ozsvth and szab  @xcite and ernst  @xcite to show a certain prime tangle must in fact be a generalized montesinos tangle .    </S>",
