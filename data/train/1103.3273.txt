    "another assumption implicit in this calculation is that the observed tail provides the true length of the stripped gas .",

    "another method used to calculate the age of a tail is to use the estimated survival time of h@xmath1 , as in gavazzi et al .",

    "what physical processes dominate the heating and mixing of stripped gas into the icm ?",
    "these processes include : turbulent mixing , which can generate intermediate temperature and density gas at constant pressure ; shock heating , which heats the ism ; radiative cooling , which can lead to recompression of heated gas , and heat conduction , which can evaporate small clouds .    in this work we focus on answering these questions by simulating gas stripping and comparing our simulated tail to a single observed stripped galaxy , eso 137 - 001 , which has been studied observationally in some detail .",

    "the @xmath26 k case resulted in a more fragmented disk whose small clouds took longer to strip . therefore the timescales for gas stripping differed , although the total amount of gas lost was similar . in the simulations presented in this paper , we find that the cooling floor affects the amount of fragmentation in the disks , but not the mass - distribution of gas densities",

    "the high velocity cases have an even larger discrepancy between the actual stripping time and the time calculated using the h@xmath0 tail length .",

    "we use a relative velocity difference of 400 km s@xmath3 ( although we do not show velocity plots in this paper , see tb10 for a detailed discussion of the tail velocity )",
    ". however , lower density clouds in our simulated tails cool and are compressed by the icm , which may instead be destroyed by the icm wind if we had better resolution that resulted in a steeper density gradient at the cloud edge .",
    "although we do not perform a detailed resolution study of the runs in this paper , we do compare t3vl to a run with only 5 allowed levels of refinement , to a minimum cell size of 76 pc , a factor of two worse in resolution .",
    "we compare outputs with the same amount of gas stripped from the galaxy .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of the lower resolution tail is @xmath590% of the luminosity of t3vl ( i.e. only a 10% change ) , while the total h@xmath1 flux is only 28% of t3vl .",
    "the total hi flux is also decreased by a similar amount ( to 33% of the value in t3vl ) .",
    "for both resolutions , there is a good correspondence between the relative hi and h@xmath1 level and morphology ; therefore , we argue that the ratio of hi to h@xmath1 is more robust than the absolute level of either .",
    "both the small discrepancy in the x - ray luminosity and larger discrepancy in the h@xmath1 flux can be explained by considering what gas is producing the emission .",
    "x - ray emission is produced by gas that is mixed with the icm and is not localized near the dense clouds in the tail , and so is not very dependent on high resolution .",
    "one explanation for the slightly lower x - ray luminosity is that mixing happens more quickly and the gas is heated out of the x - ray bright regime .    unlike the diffuse nature of the x - ray emitting gas",
    ", h@xmath1 emission occurs at the edges of clouds .",
    "we find that in projection the range of h@xmath1 intensities is the same as t3vl , meaning that the different resolution element size does not strongly affect the density and temperature at the edges of the dense clouds ( and therefore does not strongly affect the h@xmath1 emission ) .",
    "the main difference is that there are fewer dense clouds in the less - resolved wind .",
    "in fact , the total h@xmath0 column density in the low resolution tail is about 30% of the total h@xmath0 column density in t3vl  very similar to the h@xmath1 flux fraction . in projection , there are about half as many pixels with h@xmath0 column densities over 10@xmath81 @xmath8 .",
    "since we expect the total h@xmath0 column density to also depend on the number of clouds along the line of sight of the projection , we find that there should be roughly 26% as many clouds ( by simply squaring the 51% we find in the projection plane ) .",
    "of course , clouds are more than a single pixel , so this is a rough approximation .",
    "however , this indicates that the amount of h@xmath1 emission closely follows the amount of h@xmath0 column density , and likely the number of h@xmath0 clouds .",
    "there are fewer h@xmath0 clouds in the low resolution run because with lower resolution the maximum density is lower and therefore the clouds are destroyed and mixed more quickly into the icm .",
    "deep , high resolution observations in h@xmath0 will allow us to determine how many and for how long dense clouds survive , which will point to one of these mixing scenarios .",

    "we have shown that x - ray emission can coexist with h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission .",
    "we have also found that h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission spatially coincide because h@xmath1 is mostly produced at the edges of neutral clouds ( figure [ fig : slices ] ) , while x - ray emission is generated in hot , diffuse gas that is mixing with the icm .",
    "this is seen by the more even distribution in the tail ( figures [ fig : xrayproj ] and [ fig : slices ] ) , and by the fact that the x - ray tail can be longer than the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 tails .",
    "our excellent agreement with x - ray observations gives us confidence that we are correctly modeling the mixing , cooling and heating rate of x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this in turn means that heat conduction is not acting strongly to heat the diffuse gas in the tail , and that small scale turbulence ( below our resolution scale ) is not quickly mixing stripped gas .",
    "both of these mechanisms would act to heat the gas in the tail out of the x - ray bright range and therefore lower the total luminosity , which would make our agreement to the observations worse .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that we have less gas mass at higher emissivities than in eso 137 - 001 .",
    "we also find excellent agreement between our simulated h@xmath1 flux and observations of diffuse h@xmath1 emission .",
    "we robustly conclude that diffuse h@xmath1 emission coincides with h@xmath0 gas , and we find that h@xmath1 emission outlines h@xmath0 clouds in all of our simulations .",
    "the agreement between the total h@xmath1 emission in our cases with different cooling floors underscores the fact that the edges of clouds , which are interacting with the icm , emit the most strongly in h@xmath1 , not the central regions of the clouds , which are more likely to have radiatively cooled to the minimum allowed temperature .",
    "although our agreement with observations indicates that we may also be correctly modeling the edges of dense clouds , we can not dismiss the possibility that we are not fully resolving the cloud edges . in section [ sec - resolution ]",
    "we discuss how lower resolution results in fewer h@xmath0 clouds , and less h@xmath1 emission .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out that properties of our simulations that have not converged at our current resolution  the number of clouds , the rate of the decline of density at the edge of the cloud and the smallest scale of turbulent heating  have combined with the lack of heat conduction in our simulations to result in an accidental , and incorrect , agreement with observations .",

    "however , our simulation is not able to make any prediction about why there is a separated tail in eso 137 - 001 .",
    "we also do not reproduce the exact surface brightness distribution along the x - ray tail .",
    "as we have discussed , our goal was not to reproduce this specific tail . in order to do this , we would recommend modeling a smaller galaxy and matching the inclination angle between the galaxy and the icm wind .",
    "using our comparison with the observations of eso 137 - 001 , we also draw more general conclusions about the importance of turbulence and the efficiency of heat conduction in the icm .",

    "<S> this is because the stripped tail is mostly in pressure equilibrium with the icm , but mixing leaves it with densities and temperatures intermediate between the cold gas in the disk and the hot icm . given a high enough icm pressure , this mixed gas lies in the x - ray bright region of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the simulations to observations of the ram pressure stripped tail of eso 137 - 001 , showing excellent agreement in the total measured x - ray and h@xmath1 emission and non - flaring morphology of the tail , and consistent h@xmath0 measurements . using these comparisons </S>",
