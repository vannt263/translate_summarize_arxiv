    "we investigate relativistic effects in the reaction @xmath0 , in a calculation that considers the @xmath1 final state three - body distortion .",
    "the inclusion of this interaction is crucial for the interpretation of the observed behavior of the cross - section at threshold @xcite . in previous works",
    "@xcite we concluded that the shape of the cross - section very near threshold is indeed determined by the three - body nature of the final state interaction .",
    "those calculations were however made within a non - relativistic formalism , with the only addition of non - relativistic kinematics for the pion .",
    "here we introduce and solve a relativistic formalism with the following features :    \\i ) on one hand , covariant meson - nucleon amplitudes based on different data analyses @xcite of the coupled reactions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constructed for the first time . the covariant meson - nucleon amplitudes are moreover conveniently boosted ( including their dirac spin structure ) to be embedded in the meson production mechanism through which the reaction proceeds .",
    "this mechanism is the meson - exchange box diagram with the excitation of the @xmath6 resonance , represented in fig",
    "ii ) on the other hand , for the calculation of the @xmath1 final state distortion , a relativistic version of the 3-body equations is used , which incorporates relativistic kinematics and the boost of the two - body interactions .",
    "this last effect for the meson - nucleon interactions is also studied .",
    "there is a considerable dispersion of the empirical values for the @xmath2 scattering originated by different data analysis @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of relativity in the calculation of the @xmath7 cross section is needed to narrow the large uncertainty region for that scattering length . in the light of the relativistic description used here",
    ", the width of this region is seen to be narrowed .",
    "the next section describes the formalism : in section 2.a the relativistic meson - exchange driving term is introduced and in section 2.b the three - body relativistic formalism for the @xmath8d final state interaction is addressed . in section iii the results are shown and discussed .",
    "section iv summarizes the conclusions .",
    "we will start our discussion with the box diagram shown in fig.1 , which together with the impulse term , has been considered as the basic meson production mechanism @xcite .     , width=188 ]    if one evaluates this feynman diagram by putting the spectator nucleon on - the - mass - shell one obtains @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively , the deuteron - nucleon - nucleon vertex , the @xmath13 meson - nucleon - nucleon vertex , and the meson - nucleon @xmath14 nucleon t - matrix .",
    "the spinors @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , correspond respectively the two initial and the intermediate nucleon spinors , and @xmath18 is the charged - conjugated spinor .",
    "the 3-momentum variables are defined as shown on the diagram of fig",
    "one expects the effect of relativity to be important in the left hand - side of the box diagram where the exchanged meson m is very far - off - the - mass - shell .",
    "however , on the right - on - side of the diagram the final @xmath8 is restricted to the energy region of @xmath19mev , so that the effects of relativity are not so crucial .",
    "therefore , we will write the propagator for the intermediate nucleon in terms of positive and negative energy spinors and keep only the positive energy part :    @xmath20    if we now consider the deuteron wavefunction @xmath21 defined by the identification @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 relative momentum in the center of mass , we obtain from eq.([eq1 ] ) @xmath25 in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] we made explicit the momentum dependence of the nucleon spinors .",
    "the deuteron wavefunction is on the other hand calculated from @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the s- and d - wave components which we obtained from the paris potential .    for the @xmath13 meson - nucleon - nucleon vertex we take @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the meson four - momentum squared and the form factor @xmath32 is chosen to have the monopole form @xmath33 with @xmath34 mev/@xmath35 .",
    "since the @xmath8 production near threshold is dominated by the @xmath6 resonance , the @xmath13 meson - nucleon @xmath14-nucleon @xmath36 transition operator is assumed to be generated by a variable mass isobar model consisting of a single isobar , the @xmath6 . as in the framework introduced in ref.@xcite for the study of the pion induced eta production reaction ,",
    "the isobar model for meson - nucleon scattering used here is covariant , and reads : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the on - shell energies respectively of the @xmath13 meson and of the nucleon in the c.m . frame .",
    "also one has @xmath40 the meson - nucleon - isobar vertices are @xmath41 and @xmath42 here , three - momentum squared @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the meson - nucleon relative initial ( final ) three - momentum in the c.m frame .",
    "in particular , it is related to lorentz invariant quantities as @xmath45 the isobar propagator @xmath46 is obtained from a separable potential model describing the coupled @xmath47 two - body subsystem .",
    "the corresponding two - body @xmath48matrix ( [ eqtmat ] ) is also separable in any reference frame .",
    "we note that the @xmath49 channel stands for the @xmath50 inelasticity . also , in variance with refs .",
    "@xcite we do not consider @xmath51-exchange .",
    "recently in ref . @xcite it is shown that the exact numerical treatment of the initial state interaction reduces significantly the @xmath51-exchange diagram , relatively to the other meson exchanges .",

    "system , where @xmath52 , in the basis states of the nucleon spinors is given by @xmath53    we consider nucleon 2 with momentum @xmath54 in the positive direction of the z - axis and the @xmath8 meson 3-momentum in the @xmath55 plane with polar angle @xmath56",
    ". then the amplitude @xmath57 of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) satisfies the symmetry property @xmath58    in the isospin formalism the neutron and proton are identical particles , so that the initial @xmath59 state must be antisymmetrized under the exchange of nucleons 1 and 2 .",
    "however , the system is in a pure total isospin @xmath60 state , which means that the initial @xmath59 state must be symmetric under the exchange of space and spin variables .",
    "therefore , the correctly antisymmetrized amplitude @xmath61 for the @xmath7 process is @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left[a_m^{\\mu_1 \\mu_2 } ( \\vec q_{n},\\theta ) - ( -1)^{m+\\mu_1+\\mu_2 } a_m^{\\mu_2 \\mu_1}(\\vec q_{n},\\pi-\\theta ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in our previous work @xcite we presented the formalism of @xmath1 elastic scattering based on nonrelativistic faddeev equations .",
    "since we are now discussing relativistic effects in the @xmath0 process , it becomes necessary to perform here also a relativistic calculation of the @xmath1 elastic channel responsible for the final - state interaction in the @xmath0 reaction . to generate the necessary @xmath1 distorted waves , we apply to the @xmath1 elastic channel the relativistic formalism in momentum space presented in ref .",
    "this formalism generalizes in a straightforward way the non - relativistic faddeev equations .",
    "it incorporates relativistic kinematics and , importantly , also the boosts of the two - body interactions to the three - body c.m .",
    "frame    firstly , the main feature of the formalism of @xcite is to consist of a set of relativistic but 3-dimensional integral faddeev - type equations obtained from a field theory in which the three particles are kept on their mass shells in all intermediate states . accordingly , in what follows the quantity @xmath63 does not refer to the four - momentum of particle @xmath64 , but to the magnitude of the 3-momentum @xmath65 .",
    "secondly , in order to transform correctly all physical quantities from the two - body to the three - body reference frames , and after considering the energy conservation constraint , one writes the invariant momentum space volume element for the three particles in terms of the two relative jacobi variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 the variable @xmath66 is the relative momentum of the pair @xmath69 measured in the c.m .",

    "( [ eq10 ] ) we re - adjusted numericaly the strength of the potential such that the deuteron pole appears at the right position .",
    "this amounts to multiplying the original pest potential of ref .",
    "@xcite by the factor 0.78805 . as for the @xmath98 coupling constant ,",
    "it was given the reasonable value @xcite @xmath99 = 1 while for the @xmath100 coupling constant we used the value of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath101 = 8 .",
    "we give in table i the parameters of the seven models corresponding to the description of the meson - nucleon amplitude analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite by eqs .",
    "( [ eq10])-([eq14 ] ) .",
    "the agreement of the amplitudes obtained with those analyses is at least as good as the ones shown in fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and therefore we do not show here the corresponding figure .",
    "in all , to the exception of model 0 , the parameters for @xmath102-exchange are the ones that deviate less from the parameters obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from a non - relativistic calculation .",
    "however , due to its small mass , the pion contribution is affected by the relativistic treatment . in models 2 - 6",
    "relativity increases slightly the momentum range parameter @xmath103 .",
    "however , the strength parameter @xmath104 increases also .",
    "since , as seen from eq.([eq12 ] ) , it defines the weight of the small versus the large momentum region , this way it compensates the extra weight of the high momentum tail originated by the increase of the range . as for the @xmath8n channel ,",
    "the changes in the two parameters also balance out .",
    "models 1 , and specially model 0 , which correspond to smaller values for the @xmath8n scattering lenghts , behave differently than the others , since the pion range is seen to decrease . moreover , for model 0 the pion low - momentum strength @xmath104 uniquely decreases more than the range parameter @xmath103 . as a net result the weigth of the high momentum range versus the low momentum range",
    "is increased .",
    "this relative weight of small and large momenta reflects then on the behavior of the cross - section for @xmath7 , as we will see below .",
    "the difference in behavior of model 0 may be due to the inclusion of @xmath51-exchange in the meson - nucleon amplitude as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has the role of counteracting the high momenta contribution of pion exchange .",
    "we will turn now to the results obtained for the @xmath1 three - body elastic channel .",
    "we give in table ii the predictions for the three - body @xmath1 scattering length obtained using the seven two - body @xmath2-@xmath105-@xmath49 coupled interaction models .",
    "we present the results corresponding to the box diagram or driving term of the faddeev equations ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) including the different meson - exchanges , one by one , in successive cumulative steps : only @xmath8 exchange , @xmath106 exchange or @xmath107 exchange . to conclude about the extent of the relativistic effects we show for each model the non - relativistic results of @xcite ( lines labeled `` nr '' ) .",
    "the effect of the relativistic treatment on the three - body scattering length can be seen clearly in the contribution of the pion , which is the lightest meson .",
    "its contribution to the 3 body scattering length is negligible in all non - relativistic models @xcite .",
    "compared with the corresponding results of @xcite , the relativistic results are still quite similar to those of the nonrelativistic case , to the exception of model 0 .",
    "the pion exchange contribution to the scattering length is now quite important in the case of this model .",
    "this happens because in model 0 , contrarily to the other models , the relativistic changes in the range @xmath103 and low - momentum strength @xmath104 parameters are not balanced , as in the other models .    besides the changes that the relativistic two - body models induce in the pion exchange contribution , the comparison done on table ii gives also indirect information on the magnitude of the boosts of the two body interactions within the 3-body system .",
    "given the agreement observed in most cases between the relativistic and non - relativistic models , boost effects do not appear relevant . since the energies involved ( @xmath108 100 mev ) , are much smaller than the masses of the @xmath8 and the nucleon , this is expected .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the cross section of the @xmath7 process when only pion exchange is included in the box diagram ( see fig . 1 ) and * no * final - state interaction is included .",
    "we considered a reduction factor of 5 corresponding to the initial - state interaction @xcite .",
    "although some of the models ( those with a large @xmath2 scattering length ) predict more or less the right magnitude for the cross section at large energies , near threshold they all fail to reproduce the enhancement shown by the data .",
    "we notice that the models with larger relative low - momentum strength parameter @xmath104 , larger absolute pion strength @xmath109 and smaller absolute @xmath8 strength @xmath110 , are closer to the data away from threshold , where indeed only small momentum transfer is needed .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the corresponding results when in addition the contribution of the exchanges of the @xmath8 and @xmath102 mesons are included in the box diagram . from both figs . 2 and 3",
    "it is clear that the dominant exchange mechanism for the @xmath0 process is pion exchange .",
    "this conclusion was also found by the substantially different calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider next the situation with regard to the final @xmath1 distortion of the @xmath0 process .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the results when in addition one includes the final - state interaction .",
    "the models with a large @xmath2 scattering length give a good description of the data near threshold .",
    "this was already the case for the non - relativistic case in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig . 6 therein ) .",
    "the new feature of the relativistic calculation is that the high - energy end is now described by those models .",
    "however , they fail to reproduce the shape of the cross section in the intermediate region .",
    "the good description of the cross section at the high energy end by models 2 - 6 is due to the modification of the range and strength parameters for the pion in the dynamical two - body models - and does not happen for models 0 and 1 .    finally , we introduced in the box diagram the contribution of the @xmath111 meson with coupling constants adjusted so as to reproduce the cross section near threshold .",
    "since this is a heavy meson exchange , this process acts like a background correction to the isobar model of the nucleon - meson amplitude .",
    "we show the results in fig .",
    "this figure is indicative that a reasonable description of the data could be obtained with a model in between model 0 and model 1 , i.e. , with a @xmath2 scattering length larger than 0.42 fm and smaller than 0.72 fm .",
    "a finer tuning beyond this point demands an exact treatment of the initial state reduction effect , which as explained in ref @xcite , may be different for the different meson exchanges .",
    "to summarize , a relativistic calculation of the @xmath7 , based on meson exchange production mechanisms , confirms that the final state @xmath8d interactions is very important near threshold , as found before in non - relativistic models .",
    "this interaction alone explains the enhancement effect observed in the cross section near threshold .",
    "although the pion exchange visibly does not describe the data near threshold , an important conclusion is that the relativistic pion exchange contribution dominates the reaction exchange mechanisms .",
    "moreover , it describes the high energy end of the measured cross - section , which was not the case for the non - relativistic version .",
    "finally , relativistic models corresponding to relatively lower values of the @xmath8d scattering length , e.g. the julich model , when compared to their non - relativistic counterparts , have the pion strength in the large momentum tail accentuated relatively to the small momentum region .",
    "simultaneously , however , the overall pion strength is reduced .",
    "these two features seem to be needed to describe successfully the energy dependence of the cross - section , in the threshold region , as well as away from the threshold energy region .",
    "the control of relativistic effects are therefore important in phenomenological analysis of the reaction .",
    "namely , it narrows considerably the uncertainty in the knowledge of the @xmath8n scattering length . a value for this one between 0.42 fm and 0.72 fm seems to be indicated by this study .",
