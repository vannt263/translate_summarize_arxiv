    "the polaron problem ( for an introduction see ref .  ) has originally emerged in the solid state physics as a problem of electron moving in a ( dielectric ) medium .",
    "it became clear , however , that this problem is of essential general - physical interest , as a model of a quantum object strongly coupled to an environment .",
    "starting from the work of landau @xcite , the polaron problem has been attracting a permanent attention , serving as a testing ground of new non - perturbative methods .",
    "the most popular model in the polaron problem is the so - called frhlich hamiltonian describing an electron coupled to non - dispersive ( optical ) phonons of a dielectric medium via its polarization ( plank s constant and electron mass are set equal to unity ) @xcite : @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 in eqs .",
    "( [ h]-[v ] ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the annihilation operators for the electron with momentum @xmath7 and for the phonon with momentum @xmath8 , respectively , @xmath9 is the @xmath8-independent phonon frequency , which can be set equal to unity without loss of generality , @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling constant .    despite a lot of work addressed to the frhlich hamiltonian , the model is still far from being completely understood . in the most interesting region - at intermediate and large values of @xmath10 ,",
    "almost all available treatments are of variational character .",
    "hence , these treatments , even if consistent with each other , can not guarantee quantitative and qualitative reliability of the results . moreover , some treatments are known to be in qualitative disagreement with the others . as a characteristic example , note that certain approaches suggest that the polaron states at small and large @xmath10 s are of qualitatively different nature , and there should occur a sort of phase transition in the parameter @xmath10 @xcite ( see , however , discussion in ref .  ) .",
    "the study of such important issues as electron @xmath11-factor and the structure of the polaronic cloud was also restricted to the perturbation theory and variational treatments at small momenta @xcite .",
    "it remained unclear what are the limits of applicability of these results , and whether they correctly describe the physics of polarons in the most important range of intermediate @xmath10 .",
    "recently , a method of diagrammatic quantum monte carlo ( mc ) was developed , which is very efficient for the polaron - like problems @xcite .",
    "the method allows direct simulation of entities specified in terms of ( positive definite ) diagrammatic expansions . in ref .",
    "the polaron green function was simulated , and the results were used to extract the polaron spectrum .",
    "in the present paper , we employ the diagrammatic monte carlo scheme of ref .   for a detailed study of the frhlich model .",
    "we significantly enhanced the original scheme by ( i ) introducing @xmath12-phonon green functions ( with @xmath13 external phonon lines ) , which are simulated in one and the same mc process with the ordinary ( @xmath14-phonon ) green function , ( ii ) developing a powerful procedure of spectral analysis of the green function .",
    "the @xmath12-phonon green functions allow us to consider the structure of the phonon cloud and facilitate obtaining polaron parameters at large @xmath10 , where the polaron is essentially a many - phonon object .",
    "in particular , direct estimators for the energy , effective mass , group velocity , and @xmath11-factors can be constructed .",
    "the spectral analysis of the green function gives the most complete information about the polaron , including the possibility to reveal stable and metastable excited states , if any .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce the set of green functions , describe the corresponding diagrammatic series , and discuss how they are related to the polaron parameters . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we describe qualitatively the monte carlo procedure [ the quantitative discussion of the updates is given in the appendix a ] .",
    "the calculated properties of the polaron ( energy , effective mass , structure of the polaronic cloud , ets . ) are presented in section [ sec:4 ] . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we analyze excited states of the polaron by restoring the spectral density of the green function by a novel method of the spectral analysis [ detailed description of the method is presented in appendix b ] .",
    "in this section we introduce basic entities and establish their relations , which will be utilized in the rest of the paper .",
    "we start with the standard green function of the polaron in the momentum ( @xmath15 )  imaginary - time ( @xmath16 ) representation : @xmath17    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the vacuum state .",
    "the physical information that @xmath20 contains is clear from the expansion @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a complete set of eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath23 in the sector of given @xmath15 , i.e.  @xmath24 ,  @xmath25 . since in our model @xmath26",
    ", we omit it below . rewriting eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) as @xmath27 @xmath28 one defines the spectral function @xmath29 which has poles ( sharp peaks ) at frequencies corresponding to stable ( metastable ) particle - like states .",
    "hence , if at a given @xmath15 there exists a stable polaron with the energy @xmath30 , the spectral function reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 moreover , if the polaron state is the ground state , its energy and @xmath11-factor are  projected out \" by the green function behavior at long times : @xmath33    along with the standard polaron green function ( [ g ] ) , it is reasonable to introduce the @xmath12-phonon green function @xmath34 relations ( [ l]-[asym ] ) are readily generalized to the case of @xmath12-phonon green function .",
    "in particular , the @xmath12-phonon @xmath11-factor for the stable ( groundstate ) polaron with momentum @xmath15 , @xmath35 [ the momentum @xmath36 is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ g_n ] ) ] , is given by @xmath37    our mc procedure of simulating green functions will utilize a standard diagrammatic expansion - matsubara technique at @xmath38 .",
    "the diagrams ( see figs .  [",

    "external lines of diagrams arise from the operators standing in eqs .",
    "( [ g ] ) , ( [ g_n ] ) and their times and momenta are defined accordingly .",
    "momenta of the internal lines are free up to the momentum conservation constraint at each vertex . to obey this constraint , we choose phonon momenta to be free , fixing thus the momenta of the electron lines .",
    "times ascribed to the line ends are subject to the chronologization constraint : the time of the left end is @xmath14 , the time of the right diagram end is @xmath16 , times of the vertexes must increase along the global electron line , directed from @xmath14 to @xmath16 .",
    "integration over all free parameters of the diagrams is assumed , within the domains consistent with the constraints .    upon the formulation of the diagrammatic rules , it is reasonable to introduce the irreducible @xmath12-phonon green function , @xmath43 , which consists only of irreducible diagrams .",
    "[ by irreducible diagrams we understand those ones that _ do not _ contain phonon lines decoupled from the electron .",
    "] > from this definition it is clear that the reducible part of the @xmath12-phonon green function , @xmath44 , is a sum of products of irreducible functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and free phonon propagators .",
    "therefore , the reducible part does not contribute to the large-@xmath16 asymptotics of @xmath47 [ because of extra factors @xmath48 coming from the disconnected phonon propagators ] , and , in particular , eq .",
    "( [ asym_n ] ) holds true for @xmath43 as well .",
    "it is usefull then to consider the following function : @xmath49 [ note , that if @xmath50 , this expression would be singular at @xmath51 because of the divergence of the integrals for disconnected phonon propagators ] .",
    "the function @xmath52 is readily calculated by our mc procedure ( see next sections ) and , according to ( [ asym ] ) , ( [ asym_n ] ) , satisfies the relation @xmath53 here we took into account the completeness relation @xmath54 eqs .  ( [ asym_p ] ) , ( [ complete ] ) imply that the lowest level @xmath30 is non - degenerate .",
    "otherwise one should introduce degeneracy factors to the right - hand sides of the equations .",
    "in the previous work @xcite it has been shown how to sum convergent ( and arbitrary otherwise ) diagrammatic series numerically without systematic errors . in this section",
    "we outline the basic numerical procedure of evaluating series for various green functions described in the previous section [ the details being discussed in the appendix a ] , and introduce a number of estimators , that render the evaluation process significantly more efficient .",
    "suppose that we are interested in the function @xmath55 , which depends on a set of variables @xmath56 , and which is given in terms of a series of integrals with an ever increasing number of integration variables : @xmath57 here @xmath58 indexes different terms / diagrams of the same order @xmath59 .",
    "the term @xmath60 is understood as a certain function of @xmath61 .",
    "both external @xmath56 and internal @xmath62 variables are allowed to be either continuous or discrete ; in the latter case integrals are understood as sums .",
    "diagrammatic mc process is a numeric procedure based on the metropolis principle @xcite that samples various diagrams in the parameter space @xmath63 and collects statistics for @xmath64 in such a way that the final result converges to the exact answer .",
    "the process has very much in common with the monte carlo simulation of a distribution given by a multi - dimensional integral .",
    "nevertheless , there is an essential difference associated with the fact that integration multiplicity in the expansion eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) is varying .",
    "summing the series for @xmath55 is the process of sequential stochastic generation of diagrams described by functions @xmath65 , eq .  ( [ main ] ) .",
    "the mc process consists of a number of elementary updates falling into two qualitatively different classes : ( i ) those which do not change the type of the diagram ( change the values of arguments in @xmath65 , but not the function itself ) , and ( ii ) those which do change the diagram order .",
    "the set of elementary updates and their implementation is problem - specific ; the only necessary requirements are ergodicity , i.e. , given two arbitrary diagrams it takes finite number of updates to transform one to another , and detailed balance , i.e. , diagrams contribute to the statistics according to ratio of their @xmath66-functions . in the appendix",
    "a we describe a set of updates which we find to work very efficiently .",
    "however , considering enormous freedom in constructing various updates , we have little doubts that they may not be further improved .",
    "though green function contains complete information associated with the polaron spectrum , and the accumulation of the histogram for @xmath67 is straightforward , it is reasonable to introduce certain direct estimators , including one for the green function itself .",
    "these estimators substantially enhance the accuracy of calculations and/or allow collecting more information during one mc run ( by  spreading \" the data to the different values of the external parameters ) .",
    "we start with the family of estimators that are constructed in accordance with the following standard mc rule .",
    "suppose we have some quantity @xmath68 specified by the diagrammatic expansion @xmath69 where @xmath70 s are the diagrams for @xmath68 which are parametrized by internal variables denoted by the unified index @xmath71 , and the summation over @xmath71 is understood as the summation over discrete variables and integration over the continuous ones .",
    "suppose next that all @xmath70 s are positive definite and we have a mc process of generation of random @xmath71 with probability density given by @xmath70 .",

    "( [ ba ] ) are , respectively , the partition function and an observable . we , however , will use this relation in a somewhat different context .",
    "for one thing , in our case @xmath68 and @xmath72 can correspond to one and the same green function , but at different values of external parameters ( say , momentum or coupling constant ) . this way we are able to obtain results for a number of different values of the external parameters from a mc process for just one fixed set of parameters .",
    "we can also directly calculate derivatives with respect to the external parameters . to this end",

    "the first one is the well - known saw - tooth instability of the linear fredholm equation of the first type  an approximate solution @xmath374 does not reproduce the true solution @xmath367 even if @xmath374 generates the green function @xmath377 which reproduces @xmath368 with any preassigned accuracy .",
    "this difficulty is treated usually by the regularization method that smoothes the saw - tooth noise of approximate solution @xmath374 .",
    "the idea of the regularization method is to introduce some nonlinearity into eq .",
    "( [ ap_sp1 ] ) that imposes constraints on the derivatives of @xmath374 .",
    "there are two main drawbacks of this method .",
    "first , regularization method is unable to restore the spectral density which has sharp features .",
    "second , due to a distortion of the initial equation by additional regularization terms the approximate solution reproduces the function @xmath368 with relatively high deviation @xmath378 .",
    "hence , the information from the most representative region of the deviations @xmath379 is lost .",
    "the second difficulty inherent to the problem of solving equation ( [ ap_sp1 ] ) is that any representation of @xmath374 by a preassigned discrete set @xmath380 is the source of uncontrollable systematic errors .",
    "for one thing , if the function @xmath367 contains a sharp feature with a significant weight at some @xmath381 , which does not match the discrete set @xmath382 , this feature can not be reproduced properly and , therefore , the rest of the spectral density can be distorted beyond recognition .",
    "note , that all iteration methods as well as the methods based on solving the nonlinear system of equations use preassigned discretisation of the @xmath212-space .    we present a method of solving equation ( [ ap_sp1 ] ) that avoids distortion of equation by nonlinear terms and ,",
    "thus , probes the most representative interval of deviations . besides",
    ", the method does not suffer from systematic errors as it does not involve preassigned discretisation of the @xmath212-space .",
    "the idea of the method is to generate by a stochastic procedure a ( large enough ) set of @xmath383 positive definite statistically independent approximate solutions @xmath384 with deviation measures @xmath385 .",
    "and then , taking advantage of the linearity of eq .",
    "( [ ap_sp1 ] ) , choose the final solution as the average @xmath386 the reason is that while the particular solution @xmath387 possesses the saw - tooth instability , the stochastic character of the procedure of particular solution generation should lead to averaging out the saw - tooth noise .",
    "note , that the condition @xmath388 and constraint ( [ ap_sp2 ] ) substantially enhance the convergence of the averaging ( [ ap_sp4 ] ) .",
    "the method of generation of a particular solution is based on the optimization of the deviation @xmath389",

    "the weight function @xmath391 is to efficiently utilize information from the whole range @xmath392 $ ] , even in the case when the function @xmath368 decreases by orders of magnitude with @xmath16 .",
    "note , that we use weight function @xmath391 rather than @xmath393 to avoid feedback instabilities in generation @xmath374 .",
    "our optimization procedure does not involve preassigned fragmentation of the @xmath212-space .",
    "the number of parameters used for parametrization of the spectral density function @xmath374 is being varied during optimization process , so that any spectral function can , in principle , be reproduced within any preassigned accuracy .",
    "the process of generating a particular solution involves a random choice of the initial - configuration parameters and subsequent optimization of the deviation by changing the parameter values , as well as the number of the parameters . the maximal number of continuous parameters and the number of particular solutions @xmath383 are limited only by the computer performance .",
    "we parametrize @xmath394 as a sum @xmath395 of rectangulars @xmath396 @xmath397 \\ ; , \\\\ 0           & , \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\mbox{otherwise}\\ ; . \\end{array } \\right .   \\label{ap_sp7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] determined by height @xmath398 , width @xmath399 , and center @xmath400 .      to express the deviation ( [ ap_sp5 ] ) as an analytic function of the values of @xmath67 and @xmath405 at the set of times @xmath373 [ where the function @xmath368 is known ] , we use linear interpolation between closest points .    note , that the specific type of the functions ( [ ap_sp7 ] ) is not crucial for the general features of the method although simple form of analytic expressions ( [ ap_sp9 ] , [ ap_sp10 ] ) is of value for fast performance .",
    "the procedure of obtaining a particular solution @xmath387 consists of randomly generating some initial configuration @xmath406 followed by nondeterministic sequence of configuration changes until deviation satisfies the condition @xmath407",
    "< d_u \\sim d_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize min } } \\label{ap_sp11}\\ ] ] ( @xmath408 is the upper limiting deviation . ) for final configuration @xmath409 .",
    "the nondeterministic character of configuration changes is achieved by random selection of various elementary updates .      by elementary update",
    "we mean a random change of the configuration , which is either accepted or rejected in accordance with certain rules .",
    "there are two classes of elementary updates .",
    "the updates of the class i do not alter the number of rectangulars , @xmath410 , changing only the values of the parameters from a randomly chosen set @xmath411 .",
    "the updates of the class ii either add a new rectangular with randomly chosen parameters @xmath412 , or remove stochastically chosen rectangular @xmath413 from the configuration . if a proposed change violates constraint ( [ ap_sp10 ] ) ( e.g. , a change of @xmath414 or @xmath415 , or any update of the class ii ) , then the necessary change of some other parameter set @xmath416 is simultaneously proposed , to satisfy the requirement of the constraint .",
    "the updats should keep parameters of a new configuration within domain of definition of configuration @xmath417 .",
    "formally , the domains of definition of configuration ( [ ap_sp8 ] ) are @xmath418 $ ] , @xmath419 $ ] , @xmath420 $ ] , and @xmath421 $ ] . however , for the sake of faster convergence , we reduce domains of definition .",
    "as there is no general _ a priori _ prescription for choosing reduced domains of definition , the rule of thumb is to start with maximal domains and then , after some rough solution is found , reduce the domains to reasonable values suggested by this solution . in particular , since the probability to propose a change of any parameter of configuration is proportional to @xmath422 , it is natural to restrict maximal number of rectangulars @xmath423 $ ] by some large number @xmath424 .",
    "to forbid rectangulars with extremely small weight , which contribution to @xmath403 is less than statistic errors of @xmath368 , one can impose the constraint @xmath425 $ ] , with @xmath426 .",
    "when there is some preliminary knowledge that overwhelming majority of integral weight of the spectral function @xmath367 is in a range @xmath427 $ ] , one can restrict the domain of definition of the parameter @xmath428 by @xmath429 $ ] .",
    "then , to reduce the phase space one can choose @xmath430 $ ] and @xmath431 $ ] .    while the initial configuration , the update type , and the parameter to be altered are chosen stochastically ,",
    "the variation of the values of the parameters relevant to the update is optimized to maximize the decrease of @xmath66 .",
    "each elementary update of our optimization procedure ( even that of the class ii ) is organized as a proposal to change some continuous parameter @xmath110 by randomly generated @xmath432 in a way that the new value belongs to @xmath433 .",
    "although proposals with smaller values of @xmath432 are accepted with higher probability it is important , for the sake of better convergence , to propose sometimes changes @xmath432 that probe the whole domain of definition @xmath433 . to probe all scales of @xmath434 $ ]",
    "we generate @xmath432 with the probability density function @xmath435 , where @xmath436 .    calculating the deviation measures",
    "@xmath437 , @xmath438 , @xmath439 , and searching for the minimum of the parabolic interpolation , we find an optimal value of the parameter change @xmath440 where @xmath441 and @xmath442 in the case @xmath443 and @xmath444 we adopt as the update proposal @xmath445 one of the values @xmath446 , @xmath447 , or @xmath448 for which the deviation measure @xmath449 is the smallest . otherwise , if the parabola minimum is outside @xmath433 , one has to compare only deviations for @xmath446 and @xmath447 .",
    "the updating strategy has to provide efficient minimization of the deviation measure until criterion ( [ ap_sp11 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is highly inefficient to accept only those proposals that lead to the decrease of deviation , since , in a general case , there is an enormous number of deviation local minima @xmath450 > d_{u}$ ] . as we observed it in practice ,",
    "these multiple minima drastically slow down ( or even freeze ) the process .    to optimize escape from a local minimum",
    ", one has to provide a possibility of reaching a new local minimum with lower deviation through a sequence of less optimal configurations .",
    "it might seem that the most natural way of doing this would be to accept sometimes ( with low enough probability ) the updates leading to the increase of the deviation . however , this simple strategy turns out to be impractical .",
    "the reason is that the density of configurations per interval of deviation sharply increases with @xmath451 . so that the acceptance probability for a deviation - increasing update should be fine - tuned to the value of @xmath451",
    "otherwise , the optimization process will be either non - convergent , or ineffective [ if the acceptance probability is , correspondingly , either too large , or too small in some region of @xmath451 ] .",
    "a way out of the situation is to perform some sequence of @xmath453 _ temporary _ elementary updates of a configuration @xmath454 @xmath455 where the proposal to update the configuration @xmath456 is ( temporary ) accepted with the probability @xmath457 < d[{\\cal c}(r ) ] \\ ; , \\\\",

    "then we choose out of the configurations @xmath460 ( [ ap_sp15 ] ) the one with minimal deviation and , if it is different from @xmath454 , declare it to be the result of the global update , or , if this configuration turns out to be just @xmath454 , reject the update .",
    "we choose the function @xmath246 in the form @xmath461 which leads to comparatively high probabilities to accept small increases of deviation measures and hampers significant enlargements of deviation .",
    "empirically , we found out that the global update procedure is most effective if one keeps parameter @xmath462 at the first @xmath463 steps of sequence ( [ ap_sp15 ] ) ( to leave local minimum ) and then changes this parameter to a value @xmath464 for the last @xmath465 elementary updates ( to decrease the deviation measure ) . in our algorithm",
    "the values @xmath466 $ ] , @xmath467 $ ] , @xmath468 $ ] , and @xmath469 $ ] were stochastically chosen for each global update run .",
