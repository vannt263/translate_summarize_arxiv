    "the presence of charged quantum vacuum fluctuations induces self - interactions of the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "in particular , light passing through a strong external magnetic field is expected to travel at reduced velocity compared to the propagation through plain vacuum  @xcite .    as we argue in the following",
    ", the combination of ground - based gravitational - wave interferometers and strong pulsed magnetic fields forms an instrument which is sensitive enough to demonstrate nonlinearities in the propagation of light and thereby contribute to the research of strong - field qed @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it facilitates a search for light particles beyond our current standard model of particle physics .",
    "in order to detect gravitational - waves by means of interferometry , two evacuated tubes of equal length @xmath0 are installed orthogonally with respect to each other .",
    "the respective tubes have a mirror installed at their ends and thus form a cavity for a laser beam which is directed through both tubes by means of a beam splitter .",
    "an incoming gravitational - wave will induce a relative change @xmath1 among the lengths of the two arms as a function of time .",
    "alternatively , an _ apparent _ change of optical path length @xmath0 can be caused by applying an external magnetic field @xmath2 over a distance @xmath3 in one of the interferometer arms , as the light traveling through the magnetic field region will propagate at reduced velocity .",
    "using natural units @xmath4 , this implies a so - called _ strain _ in the interferometer @xmath5 as first suggested by @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "since the sensitivity of the interferometer to the strain @xmath6 is limited by diverse sources of noise , the temporal variation of @xmath6 should be adapted to the region of highest sensitivity .",
    "generically , gravitational - wave interferometers are most sensitive to variations at frequencies of about @xmath7 .",
    "more precisely , the specific sensitivity of each interferometer can be read off its spectral noise density function @xmath8 , see e.g.  @xcite . in conclusion , for the detection of nonlinear light propagation with the help of gravitational - wave interferometers one needs magnetic fields varying at the millisecond scale .",
    "in fact , such pulsed fields are provided by several magnetic field laboratories around the world .",
    "focussing on the ongoing research at the dresden high - magnetic - field - laboratory ( hdl )  @xcite , we consider the specifications of a technically feasible helmholtz - coil setup with a coil diameter of @xmath9 .",
    "the need for a helmholtz setup arises from the fact that no nonlinearities are induced for light traveling along the direction of the magnetic field lines .",
    "by contrast , for light traveling orthogonally to the magnetic field lines , the effect is maximized , depending on the beam polarization .",
    "a feasible model for @xmath10 subsequent field pulses is a damped sinusoidal oscillation : @xmath11 with pulse frequency @xmath12 and a damping constant @xmath13 . for the following estimates",
    ", we assume @xmath14 and @xmath15 which fixes the amplitude @xmath16 and relates the remaining parameters via @xmath17 .    a meaningful measure for the visibility of the strain @xmath6 is the signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) @xmath18 .",
    "its value is a measure for the likeliness that the strain is induced by the external magnetic field rather than due to random noise fluctuations . applying a matched filter ( or  wiener filter  )",
    "@xcite , the square of the snr is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the fourier transform of the induced strain .",
    "a lever arm for the enhancement of this observable is provided by the fact that the setup for the field pulse is non - destructive and thus the pulse can be repeated after the magnet system has been re - cooled . depending on the details of the setup ,",
    "the re - cooling time of the magnet system is on the order of several minutes . to good accuracy",
    ", @xmath10 subsequent pulses can enhance the snr by a factor of @xmath21 : @xmath22",
    "minicharged particles ( mcp ) , while the figure on the right - hand side applies to axion - like particles ( alp ) .",
    "already a single pulse measurement at advanced ligo can improve the best current laboratory bounds  @xcite in the respective coupling - mass planes . ]     minicharged particles ( mcp ) , while the figure on the right - hand side applies to axion - like particles ( alp ) .",
    "already a single pulse measurement at advanced ligo can improve the best current laboratory bounds  @xcite in the respective coupling - mass planes . ]",
    "we start by computing the number of pulses required to achieve a total snr of @xmath23 for the strain induced by nonlinear qed . to maximize the effect ,",
    "the laser beam should be polarized in parallel to the external magnetic field lines .",
    "the velocity shift then reads  @xcite @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the fine - structure constant and @xmath26 the electron mass .",
    "together with the parameterization of the field pulse , see eq . , the velocity shift can be translated into the snr through eqs .   and  , while the number of required pulses @xmath10 enters through eq .  .",
    "we perform the calculation for the noise densities @xmath8 of the advanced ligo  @xcite , which consists of interferometer arms of length @xmath27 , and geo600  @xcite , where @xmath28 . by a variation of the snr with respect to the pulse frequency @xmath29",
    ", we find that for the advanced ligo @xmath30 yields the greatest strain , while for geo600 @xmath31 is optimal . in terms of the number of required pulses , this would imply @xmath32 at advanced ligo , demanding a continuous operation over a few days , which appears reasonable .",
    "( the operation time at geo600 , however , would be several years since @xmath33 pulses would be needed for an snr of @xmath23 from the qed induced strain ) .    in analogy to the vacuum polarization induced by the electron fluctuations , also hypothetical particles with a weak coupling to photons can induce a velocity shift in the interferometer  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we therefore deduce the accessible parameter space with respect to coupling and mass for axion - like particles ( alps ) and minicharged particles ( mcps ) .    the velocity shift induced by fluctuating mcps  @xcite with fractional charge",
    "@xmath34 depends strongly on their mass @xmath35 . while for large masses",
    ", the scaling is analogous to the electromagnetic situation @xmath36 , for low mcp masses the asymptotic limit reads @xmath37 , where the laser frequency @xmath38 for the interferometers .",
    "we consider only mcp masses with a compton wavelength smaller than the separation of the helmholtz coils @xmath39 , implying @xmath40 . for smaller masses ,",
    "the homogeneous - field assumption underlying the prediction for the velocity shift is no longer valid .",
    "uncharged scalar ( s ) and pseudo - scalar ( p ) alps couple to the @xmath41 and the @xmath42 mode of the laser beam in the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the corresponding velocity shifts read  @xcite @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 with alp mass @xmath45 and coupling @xmath46 .    as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , already a single - pulse measurement at advanced ligo can improve the currently best laboratory bounds for mcps  @xcite and alps  @xcite in the upper mass ranges ( comparable to results for @xmath47 pulses at geo600 ) . taking @xmath48 pulses at advanced ligo , as needed for the qed effect , current laboratory bounds can be improved almost in the entire mass range .",
    "pulsed magnetic fields such as provided by the dresden high - magnetic - field - laboratory can contribute to the research in the strong - field domain of qed for two reasons .",
    "although they have generically a reduced field extent @xmath3 in comparison to dipole magnets , they can provide for extremely high field strengths @xmath49 .",
    "since the velocity shifts induced by nonlinear qed , alps and the large mass regime of mcps scale with @xmath50 , the reduced field extent can well be compensated for , see also  @xcite .",
    "secondly , their pulse frequency can be well matched to the region of highest sensitivity of gravitational - wave interferometers .",
    "for these reasons , combining strong pulsed magnetic fields with the interferometric techniques provided by modern gravitational - wave interferometers can give access to an unexplored parameter regime of strong field qed and at the same time allow to search for particles of a hidden sector .",
