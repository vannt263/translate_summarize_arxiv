    "the radio - guided surgery ( rgs ) is a technique that facilitates the surgeon when evaluating the completeness of the tumoral lesion resection , while minimizing the amount of healthy tissue removed .",
    "the impact of the rgs on the surgical management of cancer patients includes providing the surgeon with vital and real - time information regarding the location and the extent of the lesion , as well as assessing surgical resection margins .",
    "the technique makes use of a radio - labelled tracer , preferentially uptaken by the tumor to discriminate the cancerous tissue from the healthy organs , and a probe ( for a review see ) , sensitive to the emission released by the tracer , to identify in real time the targeted tumor focus .",
    "the radio - pharmaceutical is administered to the patient before surgery .",
    "current clinical applications of the rgs are : radio - immuno - guided surgery ( rigs ) for colon cancer , complete sentinel - node mapping for malignant melanoma and breast cancer , and detection of parathyroid adenoma and bone tumors ( such as osteoid osteoma ) .",
    "there are also clinical studies on the application to neuro - endocrine tumors ( net ) .",
    "established methods make use of a combination of a @xmath6-emitting tracer with a @xmath6 radiation detecting probe ( see for instance refs and references therein ) .",
    "since @xmath6 radiation can traverse large amounts of tissue , any uptake of the tracer in nearby healthy tissue represents a non - negligible background , often preventing the usage of this technique .    to overcome these limits and extend the range of applicability of rgs",
    ", it was suggested to use pure @xmath7-emitting radio - isotopes instead of the @xmath6-emitting tracers .",
    "@xmath0 radiation indeed penetrates only a few millimetres of tissue with essentially no @xmath6 contamination , since the _ bremsstrahlung _ contribution , that has a 0.1% emission probability , can be considered negligible .",
    "this novel approach allows to develop a handy and compact probe which , detecting electrons and operating with low radiation background , provides a clearer delineation of margins of the lesioned tissue .",
    "it also requires a smaller activity to detect tumor remnants compared to traditional rgs approaches so that , due to the lower absorbed dose and the short range of electrons , the radiation exposure of the medical personnel becomes almost negligible .    for this novel technique to be applicable ,",
    "tracers capable to deliver pure @xmath0 emitting radio - nuclides are needed . among the existing tracers ,",
    "those used for molecular radio - therapy , in particular the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( prrt ) with @xmath1y , are the first candidates to be considered .",
    "furthermore , neurosurgery is one of the fields that would profit most from rgs , given the importance of complete lesion removal .",
    "finally , pre - surgical imaging is scarcely effective for the search for remnants because the operative field changes substantially during the brain tumor resection .",
    "this makes @xmath1y - labeled [ 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane - n , n@xmath2,n@xmath3,n@xmath4-tetraacetic acid0-d - phe1,tyr3]octreotide ( dotatoc ) an optimal candidate tracer for a first application of rgs with @xmath0 radio - nuclides in brain tumors : meningioma has long been known to have an important uptake of dotatoc and there are recently studies showing that also hgg presents receptors to somatostatin .",
    "existing studies focus on the characteristics of the uptake needed for molecular radio - therapy .",
    "this paper studies instead , in the case of meningioma and hgg , the aspects that are critical in the case of rgs , when the administered activities are significantly lower and the required tumor - to - non - tumor ratio ( tnr ) is smaller .",
    "the first goal of this study was to assess the uptake of @xmath1y - dotatoc in meningioma , hgg and nearby healthy tissue . to this aim",
    ", we have examined pet scans with @xmath5ga - dotatoc of the two diseases , with the reasonable assumption that ga and y are chemically similar enough not to alter the kinetics of the tracer .",
    "we have retrospectively analyzed , with the amide software , dicom images of 11 patients affected by meningioma and 12 by hgg and estimated the mean tumor uptake and the uptake of the nearby healthy tissues ( the `` non - tumor '' estimate needed to compute the tumor - to - non - tumor ratio , tnr ) .",
    "all patients gave their written informed consensus to clinical research .",
    "a summary of the characteristics of the meningioma and hgg patients are in tabs .",
    "[ tab : meningioma ] and  [ tab : glioblastoma ] respectively .    to estimate the mean tumor uptake , for each meningioma patient we considered several slices of the pet scan and in each of it a region of interest ( roi ) , containing only lesioned tissue on the basis of the ct scans , was defined . in presence of several lesions ,",
    "each one was considered separately ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : roi ] on the left for an example ) . in the case of the hgg ,",
    "instead , there was often a necrotic area in between uptaking tissues ( center of fig .",
    "[ fig : roi ] ) , due to previous treatments . in such cases",
    "a roi comprehensive of both the uptaking and the interstitial regions was chosen .",
    "for each of the @xmath8 slices , the effective number of voxels ( @xmath9 ) , the mean value @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and the standard deviation @xmath12 of the voxel specific activity was measured . from this information the mean value of the tumor specific activity @xmath13 and the corresponding uncertainty @xmath14 was estimated with a weighted average @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "[ fig : slices ] shows typical values of @xmath10 for different slices and their average .",
    "each slice in the dicom images is 3.27  mm thick .",
    "the effects on the margins of the tumor are masked by the spatial resolution of @xmath173  mm .",
    "such resolution causes a systematic underestimate of the activity concentration , effect known as partial volume effect ( pve ) .",
    "we have conservatively avoided to correct for it .    in order to take into account the difference in administered activity of tracer injected to the patients , the standardized uptake value ( suv )",
    "was estimated by normalizing the measured @xmath13 by the administered activity per unit of mass of the patient , after having rescaled this activity at the time of the pet scan : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the administered activity , @xmath20 mass of the patient , @xmath21 is the time elapsed between the administration and the pet scan , and @xmath22 is the @xmath5ga half - life .",
    "as far as the healthy tissue is concerned , several rois on several slices of the scan were chosen .",
    "since the @xmath0 radiation is local , the rois were chosen , by means of the information from the ct , close to the tumor margins , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : roi ] ( right ) . in this case , a weighted average was used to evaluate @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the corresponding @xmath25 .",
    "the tnr was estimated as the ratio between @xmath13 and @xmath23 .",
    "a critical element in the development of the proposed rgs method is the @xmath0 probe , where the low penetration power of the @xmath0 radiation can be exploited by reducing the size of the lateral shielding .",
    "furthermore , we have found that we could minimize the sensitivity to @xmath6 radiation by using an organic scintillator with low density but high light yield ( p - terphenyl ) .",
    "the prototype used as reference in this study has a sensitive cylinder of p - terphenyl with a radius of 2.55  mm and depth of 3  mm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : probe ] ) . to maximize the accuracy on the direction of the incoming radiation , the sensitive region",
    "is screened by 3  mm of pvc .",
    "the scintillation light is transported to a photo - multiplier tube ( pmt , hamamatsu h10721 - 210 in the prototype ) through four optical fibers .      from the measured specific activities we also extrapolated a prediction on the potentialities of the rgs with @xmath0 decays . as previously mentioned and detailed in ref .",
    ", this technique exploits the fact that the tumor has a larger uptake of dotatoc than the healthy tissues : the patient scheduled for surgery is injected , several hours in advance , with @xmath1y - dotatoc . from the dicom images , properly accounting for the radio - nuclide half - lives and assuming that the radio - tracer is administered @xmath26 hours before the intervention , we can estimate the expected specific activity in tumor ( @xmath27 ) and non - tumor ( @xmath28 ) at the time of the surgery for each patient : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath1y half - life .",
    "@xmath31  mbq / kg is a reference administered activity per unit mass , chosen as the one injected for a typical pet scan .    during surgery and after the bulk removal",
    ", the surgeon explores the surgical site with a @xmath0 probe to check the completeness of the resection.the probe will respond to the presence of the @xmath0 radiation with a signal whose rate ( @xmath32 ) will depend on the presence of radionuclides , their spatial distribution and the probe characteristics .",
    "when probing for possible tumor residuals , a threshold on the number of counts in a given time interval will have to be set to discriminate between healthy and lesion tissues .    to judge the feasibility of this approach , the measured specific activities @xmath33 need to be converted in the corresponding probe rates @xmath34 .",
    "to this aim , we performed a full simulation , including all interactions of particles with matter , with the fluka monte carlo software .",
    "in this simulation the background was represented by an extended region with a specific activity @xmath28 of @xmath1y , while the tumor residual used as benchmark is a cylinder with a radius of 3  mm and an height of 3.5  mm for a total volume of 0.1  ml .",
    "these are indeed the dimension of a typical residual that has to be identified by the probe .",
    "the tumor region is assumed to have a specific activity @xmath27 of @xmath1y .",
    "the fluka software , fully simulating the nuclear decays and the interactions of the radiation with the tissues , was used to estimate the energy deposited inside the active volume of the probe , described above , by the emitted radiation .",
    "the conversion factor between the deposited energy and the electronic signal issued by the probe was determined in laboratory tests with a point - like source of @xmath1sr of known activity . when the estimated electronic signal overcomes a threshold , that was determined in the same laboratory tests , the probe is considered to have issued a count .    from this simulation",
    "we are then capable to extract the signal rates that we expect to measure with a realistic @xmath0 probe in presence of a tumor residual ( @xmath32 ) or in presence of only healthy tissue ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "such estimates , like @xmath13 and @xmath23 that are used as input , depend on the administered activity of tracer .    from the measured detector rates we can estimate the time needed by the probe to identify a tumor residual of 0.1  ml with a given probability of false positives ( fp ) or false negatives ( fn ) . for a fixed acquisition time of the probe ( @xmath36 ) the fp and fn are defined as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 indicates the poisson probability to have @xmath39 if the mean is @xmath13 and @xmath40 is the threshold in counts that we expect to set on the probe signal .",
    "the minimum time that a surgeon needs to spend on a sample to evaluate whether it is healthy or not , @xmath41 , is determined by finding the minimal value of @xmath36 for which there exists a value of @xmath40 such that fn@xmath42 and fp@xmath43 .",
    "rgs can be practical only if , when administering the reference activity ( 3  mbq / kg ) , the time @xmath41 is not significantly longer than 1  s , a reasonable time lapse in the surgical environment .",
    "otherwise , an increase of activity would be needed . on the contrary , if @xmath41 is shorter than 1  s there are margins to reduce the administered activity .",
    "we therefore also calculated which is the minimum activity that needs to be administered ( @xmath44 ) 12 hours before surgery in order to achieve fn@xmath42 and fp@xmath43 in @xmath45  s.    it is to be noted that the scaling between activities is performed neglecting the biological wash - out of the organs . nevertheless , wash - out is faster on the healthy tissues than in the tumor , where the tracer is bound .",
    "tumors show typically a constant or increasing phase in the first day after administration and a wash - out after 24 h. since the surgery , compared to pet scan , takes place after a longer time has elapsed , the tnr was most likely underestimated and the conclusions of this study are conservative .",
    "the results of the measurements on patients affected by meningioma and hgg are in tabs .  [",
    "tab : meningioma ] and  [ tab : glioblastoma ] .",
    "they report the weight of each patient ( w ) , the administered activity in the pet with ga ( @xmath19 ) , the signal and non - tumor rate expected on the probe ( @xmath32 and @xmath35 respectively ) in each lesion , the time @xmath41 needed to identify a 0.1 ml residual and the minimum activity that needs to be administered to have @xmath45  s ( @xmath46 ) , and the diagnosis for the hgg patients considered .",
    "the last column indicates whether the patient has already undergone surgery ( s ) , radiotherapy ( rt ) , chemotherapy ( ct ) , bevacizumab ( b ) , immunotherapy ( i ) or prrt .",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , and @xmath46 are computed assuming that between the administration of @xmath1y and the surgery 12 hours elapse , while , when estimating the first three quantities , it is assumed that the reference activity @xmath31  mbq / kg is administered .",
    "the observed suv and tnr on the meningioma patients is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_men ] .",
    "about 70% of the lesions have a suv greater than 2  g / ml , i.e. administering 3  mbq / kg would yield a specific activity greater than 6  kbq / ml .",
    "the rest of the patients have a suv which is half this value . in almost all cases the tnr is greater than 10 , most of the times above 20 .    in terms of feasibility of the rgs with @xmath0 emitters , tab .  [",
    "tab : meningioma ] reports for each patient the signal and nt rate expected on the probe , the time @xmath41 needed to identify a 0.1  ml residual if an activity @xmath31  mbq / kg is administered and the minimum activity , scaled to the time of the surgery , that needs to be administered to have @xmath45  s.      the measured suv and tnr on the hgg patients is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_gli ] .",
    "about 60% of the lesions have a suv around 0.2  g / ml , i.e. administering 3  mbq / kg would yield a specific activity about 0.6  kbq / ml .",
    "the tnr is always at least four , and twice as high in one third of the cases .",
    "the only case where the uptake is marginal is the only oligodendrioma in the sample .    with such indications",
    "we have calculated the information relevant for the rgs with @xmath0 decays ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : glioblastoma ] ) and found that by administering 3mbq / kg the probe requires in a significant fraction of the cases about 5 - 6  s to discriminate between lesion and healthy tissue .",
    "in such cases , to reduce the probing time to 1  s , a therapeutical activity of 20mbq / kg would have to be administered .",
    "the novel rgs technique under development relies on the possibility to deliver efficiently and selectively a @xmath0 emitter . to this aim",
    ", this paper studies the uptake of @xmath1y - dotatoc in two cases of interest , meningioma and high grade glioma .",
    "meningioma is known to have high receptivity to somatostatine analogues and therefore it is an ideal test bench for the proposed technique . nonetheless , it is important to assess the impact of such large receptivity on the protocol of the rgs . in particular there needs to be assessed whether there are meningioma patients that do not express enough receptors for the rgs to be effective and which is the lowest activity that needs to be administered for the technique to be effective , in order to minimize the exposure of the patient and of the medical personnel .",
    "the results show that in the case of meningioma only one patient out of 11 did not express enough receptors to allow for a detection of a residual of 0.1  ml in less than 1s , nonetheless also in this case the probing time is below 2  s. we can therefore conclude that the proposed rgs can be applied to all patients .",
    "furthermore , in 60% of the patients the technique could be effective administering only 0.5 mbq / kg .",
    "it is finally to be noted that the monte carlo approach developed here will be part of the protocol to determine the activity of @xmath1y - dotatoc to administer to patients , since a pet scan with @xmath5ga - dotatoc will be acquired prior to surgery .",
    "as far as hgg patients are concerned , the literature reported a limited receptivity to dotatoc .",
    "nonetheless , it was important to ascertain whether the uptake and the tnr were sufficient for a diagnostic use .",
    "the uptake was significantly less , but nonetheless the tnr was in most of the cases larger than four , even with a conservative estimate .",
    "this implies that , in case of hgg , the rgs with @xmath0 decays is expected to be reliable if each possible residual is examined for at most 5 - 6 seconds , since the activities needed to reach the required sensitivity in 1s are too large .",
    "alternatively , to reduce the measurement time , there are still margins to improve the sensitivity of the probe : more sensitive devices can be exploited in the scintillation light collection and crystals with a larger light yield can be considered , at the expense of a more challenging engineering of the probe .",
    "it is also to be noted that the estimates are conservative because the region between areas with a good uptake is also included in the roi since it can not be established whether it is still tumor or not ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : roi ] ) .",
    "we estimated the uptake of dotatoc in meningioma and high grade glioma in the context of the feasibility study of a novel rgs technique exploiting @xmath0 decays .",
    "the results showed that in the case of meningioma the uptake is so marked that the technique can work even administering activities much smaller than the one needed for pet scans .",
    "such minimum required activity can be computed on a patient - by - patient basis .",
    "the proposed technique can also work for high grade glioma , although the limited receptivity requires a longer probing time with the current version of the probe .",
