    "coming to the present work on gallium clusters , it is by now well known that gallium clusters not only melt at substantially higher temperatures than the bulk ( @xmath3}=$ ] 303  k ) ,  @xcite but they also exhibit wide variations in the temperature dependences of their specific  heats , with some clusters showing strong peaks ( due to the latent heat ) , while others ( apparent `` non - melters '' ) showing no peak .",
    "these features show a strong dependence on cluster size , where the addition of a single atom can change a cluster with no peak in the specific  heat into a  magic melter \" with a very distinct peak .",

    "recent simulations for ga@xmath7 show a broad peak in the specific  heat centered around 600  k. the previous specific  heat measurements for ga@xmath6 extended only up to 700  k , so one possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the melting transition occurred at a slightly higher temperature than examined in the experiments . here",

    "ion mobility measurements were performed for ga@xmath6 and ga@xmath8 as a function of temperature .",
    "the ion mobility measurements provide average collision cross sections which can reveal information about the shape and volume changes that occur on melting .",
    "for example , a cluster with a non  spherical geometry might be expected to adopt a spherical shape ( a liquid droplet ) on melting .",
    "if there is not a significant shape change , there may still be a volume change on melting .",
    "most bulk materials expand when they melt ( the liquid is less dense than the solid ) . even in the absence of a significant shape or volume change",
    ", the cross sections might show an inflection at the melting transition due to the thermal coefficient of expansion of the liquid cluster being larger than for the solid ( in the macroscopic regime most liquids have larger coefficients of expansion than the corresponding solids ) .",
    "an inflection is observed in the cross sections for both ga@xmath6 and ga@xmath8 .",
    "thus , the ion mobility measurements suggest that ga@xmath6 as well as ga@xmath8 are in a liquidlike state above 800  k.    to explore the reasons behind the behavior outlined above ( i.e. , to determine why ga@xmath6 apparently melts without a peak in its specific  heat , while a peak is observed for ga@xmath8 ) , we have carried out first principles density  functional  ( df ) molecular  dynamics ( md ) calculations on both clusters .",

    "in contrast , the calculated specific  heats for ga@xmath8 show a clear peak around 750  k. this is in excellent agreement with the peak obtained from experimental measurements ( which occurs at around 700  k ) .",
    "finally , our theoretical results show that the features in the specific  heat curves are influenced by the ground ",

    "the cluster ions are generated by laser vaporization of a liquid gallium target in a continuous flow of helium buffer gas .",
    "after exiting the laser vaporization region of the source the clusters travel through a 10 cm long temperature variable extension where their temperature is set .",
    "cluster ions that exit the extension are focused into a quadrupole mass spectrometer where a particular cluster size is selected .",
    "the size selected clusters are then focused into a collision cell containing 1  torr of helium . as the clusters enter the collision cell they undergo numerous collisions with the helium , each one converting a small fraction of the ions translational energy into internal energy . if the initial kinetic energy is high enough some of the cluster ions may be heated to the point where they dissociate .",
    "the dissociated and undissociated cluster ions are swept across the collision cell by a small electric field and some of them exit through a small aperture .",
    "the ions that exit are analyzed in a second quadrupole mass spectrometer and then detected by an off ",
    "axis collision dynode and dual microchannel plates .",
    "the fraction of the ions that dissociate is determined from the mass spectrum .",
    "measurements are performed as a function of the ions initial kinetic energy , and the initial kinetic energy required for 50% dissociation ( ike50%d ) is determined from a linear regression .",
    "ike50%d is measured as a function of the temperature of the temperature ",
    "variable extension on the source .",
    "ike50%d decreases as the temperature is raised because hotter clusters have more internal energy , and hence less energy needs to be added in order to cause dissociation . at the melting transition",
    "a sharp decrease in ike50%d is expected due to the latent heat .",
    "the derivative of ike50%d with respect to temperature is approximately proportional to the specific  heat .",
    "the proportionality constant is the fraction of the clusters initial kinetic energy that is converted into internal energy , which is estimated from an impulsive collision model .",
    "a drop in the ike50%d values due to the latent heat of a melting transition leads to a peak in the specific  heat .",
    "ion mobility measurements can provide information on the shape and volume changes that occur when clusters melt .",

    "the specific  heats show a broad maximum , around 400  k wide , centered at around 725  k. the peak for ga@xmath15 is significantly broader than observed for larger clusters ( like ga@xmath16 and ga@xmath17 ) where the peak was attributed to a melting transition . however , it is well known that the melting transition , and the corresponding peak in the specific  heats , becomes broader with decreasing cluster size .",
    "thus , even though the peak in the specific - heats for ga@xmath15 is around 400  k wide , it is appropriate to assign it to a finite  size analog of a bulk melting transition .",
    "the center of the peak is at around 725  k , this is well above the bulk melting point ( 303  k ) .",

    "= 0.50    = 0.4    to understand the reason behind the different behavior observed for ga@xmath0 and ga@xmath1 , we have carried out a detailed analysis of structure and bonding in both clusters . as will be become apparent from the following discussion , that the ground ",
    "state geometry and the nature of bonding plays a crucial role in determining the finite  temperature behavior of the cluster .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the ground ",

    "we have obtained more than 50 distinct equilibrium geometries by quenching more than 200 structures , selected from a few high temperature md runs , for both sizes . in fig .",
    "[ fig.geom ] , we show the lowest energy structure along with some low lying excited state geometries of both clusters .",
    "the lowest energy geometry of the ga@xmath0 cluster  ( see fig .  [ fig.geom]a(1 ) ) is similar to that of ga@xmath7 reported in our earlier work .",

    "[ fig.geom]b(1 ) , is more symmetric . it can be described as a double decahedral structure of 19 atoms , with the bottom capped atom merging into the pentagonal plane to form a hexagonal ring . in addition , an atom from the top pentagon and the upper capped atom rearrange to accommodate the 20@xmath20 atom , leading to a dome  shaped hexagonal ring .",
    "we now analyze the structural properties in detail to get an insight into the features that influence the melting characteristics .",
    "an analysis of the bond ",
    "length distribution shows that there are 12 bonds , for each cluster , having distances less than 2.55   .",
    "@xcite interestingly , for ga@xmath21 , these short bonds are spread all over the cluster , whereas for ga@xmath19 , they form the upper and the lower hexagonal rings .",
    "the distribution of coordination numbers  @xcite indicate that for ga@xmath19 , almost all the atoms in the rings ( about 16 ) , have a coordination number of 4 . the ga@xmath21 cluster ,",
    "however , does not have such a uniform distribution of coordination numbers .",
    "thus , the ground  state geometry of ga@xmath21 might be considered to be  disordered \" , while that of ga@xmath19 exhibits a more  ordered structure .",
    "striking differences are also observed in the low energy isomers and their distribution on the potential  energy surface .",
    "as mentioned above , we have obtained more than 50 distinct isomers spanning an energy range of about 1.0  ev above the ground ",
    "states for each cluster . in fig .",
    "[ fig.isomer ] , we plot the energies of these isomers relative to the ground  state , arranged in an ascending order . the isomers for the ga@xmath21 cluster appear to exhibit an almost continuous energy distribution . while a few of these isomers are severe distortions of the ground ",
    "state geometry , the rest do not show any resemblance  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.geom]a ) .",
    "it appears that for the ga@xmath21 isomers in this low energy regime , small rearrangements of the atoms , costing just a small amount of energy , lead to several close - lying isomers , so that the isomer distribution is almost continuous . in contrast , the isomers of ga@xmath19 cluster are distributed in three groups , separated by an energy gap of about 0.2  ev  ( fig .",
    "[ fig.isomer ] ) .",
    "the first group of isomers have slightly different orientations of atoms in the hexagonal rings and are nearly degenerate with the ground  state .",
    "the second group consists of structures having only the lower hexagonal ring while the third group has no rings .",
    "this indicates that the hexagonal units of ga@xmath19 cluster are stable and difficult to break .",
    "the stability of the ring ",
    "pattern of ga@xmath19 and the isomer distribution for both clusters should have a substantial effect on the melting characteristics . indeed , as we shall see further below , these features play a crucial role in the finite  temperature characteristics .",
    "it should be mentioned that although these observations are based on rather limited search , we believe that the general features described here are essentially correct .",
    "[ table.elf ] the number of basins with more than one atom at different values of the electron localization function for the ground  state structures of ga@xmath21 and ga@xmath19 clusters .",
    "the numbers in parenthesis represent the number of atoms in each basin . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the most important difference between the two clusters is the nature of the bonding .",
    "we use the concept of an electron localization function  ( elf ) ,  @xcite to describe the nature of bonding .",
    "this function is normalized to a value between zero and unity ; a value of 1 represents a perfect localization of the valence charge while the value for the uniform electron gas is 1/2 .",
    "the locations of maxima of this function are called _ attractors _ , since other points in space can be connected to them by paths of maximum gradient .",
    "the set of all such points in space that are attracted by a maximum is defined to be the _ basin _ of that attractor .",
    "basin formations are usually observed as the value of the elf is lowered from its maximum , at which there are as many basins as the number of atoms in the system .",
    "typically , the existence of an isosurface or a basin in the bonding region between two atoms at a high elf value , say @xmath22 , signifies a localized bond in that region .",
    "= 0.4    we have analyzed the electron localization functions for ga@xmath21 and ga@xmath19 clusters for values @xmath23 . in table",
    "[ table.elf ] , we give the number of basins containing two or more atoms , for selected elf values .",
    "the table clearly shows a fragmented growth pattern of the basins for ga@xmath21 , each containing very few atoms as compared to that of ga@xmath19 .",
    "for instance , at an isovalue of 0.75 , while ga@xmath21 has three basins each having 2 atoms , ga@xmath19 has just two basins each containing 5 and 7 atoms that corresponds to the two hexagonal rings .",
    "the elf contours for the isovalue of 0.75 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.elf ] .",
    "the merged basins structures are shown by the black lines .",
    "it may be inferred that the bonds between atoms in the hexagonal rings of ga@xmath19 are strong and covalent in nature with similar strengths , while the fragmented basin growth pattern in ga@xmath21 indicates inhomogeneity of the bond strengths .",
    "the calculated , normalized , canonical specific  heats are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cv ] plotted against temperature .",
    "the plot for ga@xmath21 exhibits a broad feature ( apparently consisting of three components ) which extends from 300  k to 1400  k. for ga@xmath19 , the calculated specific ",
    "heat remains nearly flat up to about 600  k , it then increases sharply and peaks at about 800  k , in excellent agreement with the experimental results described above .",
    "thus , interesting size ",
    "sensitive features seen in the experimental heat  capacities are reproduced in our simulations .",
    "this behavior can be understood from our earlier discussion of the bond ",
    "length distributions , coordination numbers , isomer  distributions , and",
    "the nature of bonding in these clusters .",
    "while the ga@xmath21 cluster shows no real evidence for ordered behavior , the ga@xmath19 cluster has well  ordered ring  patterns .",
    "thus , when ga@xmath21 is heated , the bonds soften gradually , and the cluster hops through all its isomers continuously .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the ionic motion as a function of temperature , which shows that this cluster evolves through all isomers smoothly from 300  k to 1400  k. on the other hand , the ionic motion for ga@xmath19 shows only minor rearrangements of the atoms until 600  k , and then the cluster visits all the isomers corresponding to the first group of isomers described above . at about 700  k , the upper hexagonal ring breaks , while at about 800  k , the lower ring breaks .",
    "thus , melting of ga@xmath19 cluster is associated with the breaking of the well  ordered covalently bonded hexagonal units .",
    "= 0.4    we have also analyzed the melting characteristics via traditional parameters such as , the root ",
    "mean  squared bond  length ",
    "fluctuations  ( @xmath24 ) and the mean  squared ionic displacements ( msd ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig.delta ] , we show the @xmath24 for ga@xmath21 and ga@xmath19 clusters .",
    "this plot correlates well with the specific  heat curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cv ] .",
    "the @xmath24 for ga@xmath21 rises gradually from 300  k , while for ga@xmath19 , it rises sharply at about 700  k , and finally saturates to the same value for both clusters .",
    "it may be inferred from this observation that the behavior of both clusters at temperatures say , @xmath25  k , are similar and that both clusters can be considered to be in _ liquidlike _ states .",
    "this conclusion is further substantiated by the msd plots ( figures not shown ) , which saturate at @xmath26 21@xmath27 , at about 1200  k for both clusters .",
    "it is evident from the present study that the nature of the ground  state geometry and bonding strongly influences the finite  temperature characteristics of ga@xmath21 and ga@xmath19 . at high temperatures , @xmath25",
    "k , both ga@xmath21 and ga@xmath19 have similar root ",
    "mean  squared bond  length  fluctuations and the mean  squared ionic displacements so that both of them can be considered to be in liquidlike states .",
    "the experimental results show that while ga@xmath0 apparently undergoes a solid  liquid transition without a significant peak in the specific  heat , ga@xmath1 melts with a relatively sharp peak .",
    "the simulations show that if the cluster is  ordered \" ( i.e. a large fraction of the constituent atoms show similar bonding , coordination numbers , and bond energies ) then it is likely to show a sharp melting transition with a significant peak in the specific  heat . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cluster is  disordered \" ( i.e. the constituent atoms occur in a wide distribution of bonding environments ) it will probably undergo a solid  liquid transition without a significant peak in the specific  heat . in the latter case , the number of isomers or conformations sampled by the cluster increases steadily as the temperature is raised , instead of the abrupt increase that occurs when a cluster undergoes a sharp melting transition .",
    "these observations have interesting consequences for the finite  temperature behavior of small clusters as a function of cluster size .",
    "it is likely that as clusters grow in size their structures evolve from one well  ordered structure to another , passing on the way through some cluster sizes that have  disordered \" structures .",
    "for instance , the 13atom gallium cluster is predicted to have a highly symmetric decahedron structure with a bonding pattern that is similar to that found here for ga@xmath19 .",
    "@xcite so in the present case , cluster growth from ga@xmath28 ( a decahedron ) to ( ga@xmath19 , a distorted double ",
    "decahedron ) proceeds via a disordered ga@xmath21 structure .",
    "such behavior is also observed for sodium clusters in 40 to 55 atom size range ; the ground  state geometries of na@xmath29 and na@xmath30 are either icosahedron or close to icosahedron while that of na@xmath31 has no particular symmetry .",
    "@xcite in such cases , we expect that the specific  heats should change from showing a well  defined peak to a rather broad one , and back again to well  defined .",
    "we believe this behavior to be generic as it has not only been observed in case of gallium clusters  @xcite but also in case of aluminum clusters  @xcite , experimentally , and for sodium clusters in the simulations mentioned above .",
