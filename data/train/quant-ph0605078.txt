    "the concept of geometric phase was first introduced by panchartnam in his study of interference of classical light in distinct states of polarization @xcite .",
    "berry s work showed a quantum pure state can retain the information of its motion when it undergoes a cyclic evolution @xcite .",
    "simon @xcite subsequently recasted the mathematical formation of berry phase with the language of differential geometry and fibre bundles .",
    "he observed that the origin of berry phase is attributed to the holonomy in the parameter space .",
    "it has been pointed out that the non - abelian holonomy may be used in the construction of universal sets of quantum gates for the purpose of achieving fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the holonomy quantum information processing is vary important due to its robustness to imperfections , such as decoherence and the random unitary perturbations .    for a composite system",
    ", the berry phase will be changed by the intersubsystem couplings .",
    "berry phase can be used to the implementation of quantum computation ; all the system for the above purpose are composite .",
    "composite systems have great importance in quantum computation , such as the manipulation of qubits , the construction of entanglement and the realization of logic operations .",
    "yi et al @xcite studied the berry phase in a composite system with one driven subsystem and found that the berry phase for a mixed state @xmath0 is the average of the individual berry phases , weighted by their eigenvalues @xmath1 .    in the early discussions ,",
    "most researches were focused on the evolution of pure states .",
    "uhlmann was probably the first to address the issue of mixed state holonomy , but as a purely mathematical problem @xcite .",
    "later sjqvist et al discussed the geometric phase for non - degenerate mixed state under unitary evolution in his famous paper @xcite , basing on the mach - zender interferometer .",
    "the holonomy attacked interested due to its potential importance to fault - tolerent quantum information processing .",
    "m. nordling et al introduced the concept of non - abelian holonomy for adiabatic transport of energetically degenerate mixed quantum states @xcite .",
    "recently tong , _ _ et al__@xcite proposed a definition for mixed - state geometric phase which was gauge invariant and applicable to the non - unitary evolution , @xmath2where @xmath3 is the k - th eigenvalue of the density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "when the hamiltonian is independent of time , the phase can be reduced into @xmath5 in which @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the eigenstate of the initial density operator .",
    "the connection between geometric phase and entanglement has now drawn much attention . in a recent work",
    ", s. ryu and y. hatsugai @xcite tried to establish a connection between the lower bound of the von - neumann entropy and the berry phase defined for quantum ground states .",
    "it has been proved that in the xy spin chains , geometric phase shows scaling behavior in the vicinity of quantum phase transition point @xcite , just like entanglement @xcite . up to now",

    "in this paper , the thermal state of the hydrogen atom is discussed .",
    "as one knows , in the hydrogen atom , the electron spin is coupled to the nuclear spin by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the hyperfine line for the hydrogen atom has a measured magnitude of 1420 mhz in frequency .",
    "some calculation on the basis of first - order perturbation for the magnetic dipole interaction between the electron and nucleus gives contribution to the coupling strength of @xmath8 term .",
    "taking account of the effect of an external magnetic field , one can have a model hamiltonian which is @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10@xmath11 is the coupling constant .",

    "the nuclear magnetic moment @xmath18 equals @xmath19 where @xmath20 . in general c",
    "is much larger than d , @xmath21 , so for most applications d may be neglected . at the same level of approximation the @xmath22 factor of the electron",
    "may be put equal to 2 .    in the next sections one can discuss the geometric phase and entanglement for hydrogen atom @xmath23",
    "in this section , the geometric phase of mixed states for hydrogen atom will be discussed .",
    "one can assume that at the initial time @xmath24 , the system is subject to the external magnetic field @xmath25 , the model is not degenerate . as we know , if the magnetic field is not imposed , the ground state is degenerate .",
    "the external fields destroy the degeneracy completely .",
    "the initial state is set to be a thermal state , @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the partition function .",
    "@xmath29 . in fact , @xmath30 where @xmath31 .    at that time , the four eigenvalues of the initial hamiltonian @xmath32 are @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "it is obvious that the system is non - degenerate .    at the time t=0",
    "+ , one can assume that there is a little change of external magnetic fields , the interaction term is now @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a small constant .",
    "the eigenstate of the model will evolve with the time .",
    "now the time evolution matrix becomes @xmath37 , and @xmath38 which implies that magnetic field jumps to another fixed value at that moment .",
    "then one calculate the geometric phase of thermal states which involve with the time by means of eq.[temperature ] .",
    "obviously , the geometric phase is dependent on the external magnetic field , intersubsystem couplings , temperature and the time .",
    "the explicit form of geometric phase is very tedious , one only can study some special cases .",
    "then one can discuss the effects of some parameters upon the geometric phase respectively .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath13 , in fact , the external magnetic field .",
    "when the c approaches zero , i.e. , the magnetic field vanishes , the hamiltonian @xmath32 and the density matrix @xmath39 is commutative , the density matrix is not changed with the time .",
    "therefore in this case the geometric phase is zero .    for simplicity , we assume at the initial time , j=1 , c=1 , @xmath40 .",
    "then one study the time evolution of geometric phase for different coupling c , i.e. , for different external magnetic field . here",
    "one only need to study the effect of @xmath36 upon the geometric phase .",
    "the fig.[epsilon ] shows that for the same initial state , the magnetic field changes more , the geometric phase changes fast accordingly .",
    "hydrogen , for different @xmath36.,width=226 ]    one can consider a special case in which @xmath41 , which means at that moment the external magnetic field is disappeared . the geometric phase still evolve with the time .",

    "it is obvious that in this case , the term @xmath50 will dominate the whole hamiltonian , the density matrix will approaches zero .     for hydrogen atom , geometric phase versus j , when @xmath43 , @xmath40 at the time @xmath44.,width=226 ]    ( 3 ) .",

    "it drivers the geometric phase to approach zero .",
    "in the above , we have discussed the time evolution of geometric phase .",
    "as we know , entanglement may be created via the interaction of jointed measure , therefore the way in which intersubsystem couplings changes , the geometric phase of a composite system and those of the subsystem is of interest . here , we shall study the time evolution of entanglement . as we know",
    ", for a bi - qubit system , one can use concurrence to measure the entanglement . speaking briefly , for a bipartite system with the density matrix @xmath39",
    ", one can define concurrence @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the biggest one .",
    "the system is unentangled ( maximally entangled ) when the concurrence @xmath56 is 0 ( 1 ) @xcite .",

    "concurrence versus time at different time.,width=226 ]    fig.[con - t ] shows that as the temperature becomes lower , the value of concurrence becomes larger , which implies the system is more entangled at lower temperature .",
