    "the capacity region of interference channels ( ifcs ) , comprised of two or more interfering links ( transmitter - receiver pairs ) , remains an open problem .",
    "the sum capacity of a non - fading two - user ifc is known only when the interference is either stronger or much weaker at the unintended than at the intended receiver ( see , for e.g. , @xcite , and the references therein ) .",
    "recently , the sum capacity and optimal power policies for two - user ergodic fading ifcs are studied in @xcite and @xcite under the assumption that the instantaneous fading channel state information ( csi ) is known at all nodes . a sum capacity analysis for @xmath0-user ergodic fading channels using ergodic interference alignment",
    "is developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in general , however , the instantaneous csi is not available at the transmitters and often involves feedback from the receivers .",
    "thus , it is useful to study the case in which only receivers have perfect csi and the transmitters are strictly restricted to knowledge only of the channel statistics .",
    "the sum capacity of multi - terminal networks without transmit csi remains a largely open problem with the capacity known only for ergodic fading gaussian multiaccess channels ( macs ) without transmit csi .",
    "for this class of channels , it is optimal for each user to transmit at its maximum average power in each use of the channel ( see for e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the receiver , with perfect knowledge of the instantaneous csi , decodes the messages from all transmitters jointly over all fading realizations .",
    "recently , the sum capacity of ergodic fading two - receiver broadcast channels ( bcs ) without transmit csi has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors first develop the sum capacity achieving scheme for an _ ergodic layered erasure bc _ where the channel from the source to each receiver is modeled as a time - varying version of the binary expansion deterministic channel introduced in @xcite . in this model , the transmitted signal is viewed as a vector ( layers ) of bits from the most to the least significant bits .",
    "fading is modeled as an erasure of a random number of least significant bits and the instantaneous erasure levels , or equivalently the number of received layers ( or levels ) , are assumed to be known at the receivers . for a layered erasure fading  bc ,",
    "the authors in @xcite show that a strategy of signaling independently on each layer to one receiver or the other based only on the fading statistics achieves the sum capacity .",
    "furthermore , the authors also demonstrate the optimality of their achievable scheme to within 1.44 bits / s / hz of the capacity region for a class of high - snr channel fading distributions .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an ergodic fading layered erasure one - sided ( two - user ) ifc in which , in each channel use , one of the receivers receives a random number of layers from its intended transmitter while the other receiver receives a random number of layers from both transmitters .",
    "one can view this channel as a time - varying one - sided version of a two - user binary expansion deterministic ifc introduced and studied in @xcite .",

    "more recently , in @xcite , the sum capacity of a class of one - sided two - user and three - user ifcs in which each transmitter has limited information about its connectivity to the receivers is developed .",
    "for the ergodic layered erasure one - sided ifc considered here , we develop outer bounds and identify fading regimes for which the strategies of either decoding or ignoring interference at the interfered receiver is tight .",
    "we classify the capacity achieving regimes based on the fading statistics of the direct and interfering links as follows : i ) weak , ii ) strong ( mix of strong but not very strong ( snvs ) and very strong ( vs ) ) , iii ) _ ergodic very strong _",
