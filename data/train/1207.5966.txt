    "the system sy phe (= hd 9283 = hip 7024 ) was discovered as a variable by @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite noted that the algol - type curve is of bo  cep - type , and the additional variability is discussed .",
    "the hipparcos satellite @xcite reveals two clearly - shaped eclipses and found the period about 5.27140  day .",
    "the photometric amplitude is about 0.5  mag .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that sy  phe is still classified as a `` variable star with rapid variations '' , according to simbad , or gcvs @xcite .",
    "spectral type of the system was firstly derived as f8 by @xcite , while @xcite gave the type f4 .",
    "later @xcite noted the type f3/f5v . according to the tycho data the photometric index is @xmath0  mag , and derived the parallax of the system @xmath1  mas .",
    "however , the system consists of two visual components separated about 4@xmath2 on the sky . according to the washington double star catalog ( hereafter wds , @xcite ) , the astrometric observations of this double do not show any significant change of the position angle .",
    "therefore , the pair is only weakly gravitationally bounded and its semi - major axis is rather large .",
    "the hipparcos observations indicate that the eclipsing variable is the a component ( the brighter one ) .",
    "the system was observed by several automatic and robotized telescopes and surveys . besides the old hipparcos data ,",
    "there exist also some photometry of sy phe obtained by the asas survey @xcite , `` pi of the sky '' @xcite , and super wasp @xcite . for the photometry see fig [ figlcs ] .",
    "all of these observations were used for deriving the times of minima of sy  phe .",
    "both primary and secondary minima were derived , see table [ tablemin ] .",
    "some of the minima have relatively large uncertainty , however if we plot these minima times in the @xmath3 diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ figoc ] ) , there is clearly seen the eccentric orbit of the system .",
    "primary and secondary minima are well - separated , but the analysis of apsidal motion is still difficult .",
    "the method of apsidal motion analysis was described elsewhere , e.g. gimnez & garca - pelayo ( 1983 ) , .",
    "all of the minima times given in table [ tablemin ] were used for the analysis .",
    "unfortunately , the set of our data is still very limited and leads to many different results . from these different solutions",
    ", we chose to present here two , which have the lowest rms of the fit .",
    "these are given in table [ tableapsidal ] .",
    "as one can see , the change of argument of periastron is still rather small and one can not easily derive the correct solution .",
    "however , the very fast apsidal motion of about 17  years is less probable due to the typical longer apsidal periods in systems of this type . on the other hand , the solution ii ( see table [ tableapsidal ] ) presents so slow apsidal motion , that the value of @xmath4 is even so low that the apsidal period @xmath5 grows to many thousand years .",
    "the time spread of epochs of photometry is still too short yet , hence new precise observations are therefore needed to confirm this hypothesis with higher conclusiveness .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there can be two different explanations of the poor fit to the data . first , the orbital eccentricity of the binary should be higher , which cause the duration of the primary eclipse shorter , which is visible in the fit in fig .",
    "[ figslc ] .",
    "other explanation is the fact that there are some short - periodic variations outside of the eclipses .",
    "therefore , these variations are also presented in the eclipses and these can shift the data points a bit .",
    "the magnitude of the outside - eclipse variations is up to 0.04  mag .",
    "if these variations are physical or instrumental is still an open question .",
    "moreover , we found that there is also a season - to - season variation of the light curve .",
    "the level of outside of eclipse brightness was changed of about 0.03  mag during the period of swasp observations ( more than 500  days ) .",
    "we were trying to find some periodicity of these data after removing the light curve fit .",
    "this result is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsresid ] , where a steady increase of brightness is superimposed with the sinusoidal variation with the period of about 248.6  days .",
    "having such a long period of variations , we can only hardly identify these modulations as those making the system classified as a system `` with rapid variations '' as stated in simbad .",
    "all of these findings make any analysis difficult and new more precise standard photometry in different photometric filters would be very helpful .",
    "the first light curve and period analyses of the system sy phe were performed . dealing with no spectroscopy of the target",
    ", one has to consider some assumptions and many of the physical parameters are still affected by relatively large errors .",
    "however , we can roughly estimate the internal structure constants for both apsidal motion solutions . assuming the two eclipsing components have masses of about 1.36  m@xmath6 ( spectral type f4 )",
    ", then the semimajor axis of the orbit is about 17.8  r@xmath6 , which yields the values of radii of both components ( see table [ tablelc ] ) . using these values",
    ", one can calculate the internal structure constants and compare these values with the theoretical ones , e.g. by . the solution i gives @xmath7 k@xmath8 value of about 0.686 , while solution ii gives @xmath7 k@xmath8 = -2.198 .",
    "the latter value agrees well with the theoretical values by , assuming the f4 star is on main sequence and is about 5 @xmath9  yr old .",
    "the light curve solution also provides the first rough estimation about the third light from the distant component .",
    "our result of the third light value ( 15% of the total light ) is in excellent agreement with the @xmath10 m value provided by the wds catalogue .",
    "the nature of the long - term photometric variations with period about 249 days still remains an open question .",
    "therefore , new more detailed analysis is still needed , especially based on new spectroscopic data together with the photometric observations obtained in various photometric filters .",
    "we thank the `` asas '' , `` swasp '' and `` pi of the sky '' teams for making all of the observations easily public available .",
    "this investigation was supported by the czech science foundation grant no .",
