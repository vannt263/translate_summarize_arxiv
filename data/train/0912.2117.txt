    "in this contribution we shall determine the temperature dependence of the critical current density @xmath2 for @xmath4 thin films by measuring the harmonics of voltage @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) with the screening technique @xcite . the calculation is based on the sun model @xcite and the definition of the full penetration field @xmath6 from the critical - state model @xcite .",
    "also an extension to higher harmonics of the this model shall be worked out and compared with experimental curves .",
    "we have determined the harmonics of voltage @xmath7 based on the theoretical approach developed by sun et al .",
    "he proposed a model to compute the ac susceptibility response of thin - film superconductors under the influence of a transversal ac magnetic field @xmath8 . in response",
    "to @xmath9 shielding currents @xmath10 induce a diamagnetic moment which sun et al .",
    "found to be @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the radius of the film .",
    "the full penetration field stems from the bean result , namely @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the film thickness .",
    "actually the quantity to be measured is the voltage @xmath16 induced in the pick - up coil , which is conventionally measured with a lock - in amplifier and is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the voltage can be expanded as a fourier series : @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 stands for the real and imaginary components of voltage , respectively , @xmath21 is the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "here we shall deal with harmonics with @xmath22 .",
    "the fundamental harmonic can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the solutions for the real part read : @xmath23 ,    \\\\ v_5 ' & = & -\\frac{10 m_0e^{-h}}{h^2}\\biggl[48i_3(h)-12i_2(h)+h^2i_1(h)\\biggr ] , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the reduced field , the functions @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 ) are the modified bessel functions .",
    "the imaginary components are @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the functions @xmath30 are given by @xmath31\\biggr\\ } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ s_3 & = & -\\frac{2}{h^2}\\biggl\\{h\\cosh(h)-5\\sinh(h)-10s_2\\biggr\\}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        to determine the critical current density @xmath2 we have taken into account the criterion proposed by acosta et al .",
    "he proposed that @xmath6 is the value associated with the highest peak in the ratio @xmath32 .",
    "we also add the criterion of xing et al .",
    "@xcite , based on the measurement of the maximum of @xmath33 . under this method the critical current density is found to be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the temperature at the peak .",
    "these quantities are reported in si units .",
    "measurements of harmonics in voltage using the screening @xcite technique were carried out on superconducting thin films of @xmath36 with a @xmath37 k. we applied a transverse @xmath38 field whose amplitude could vary from 0 to 5000 a / m with a fixed frequency of 1 khz . for the ratio @xmath39 we have realized 11 different plots each corresponding to the temperatures : 20 , 35 , 45 , 55 , 65 , 70 , 75 , 78 , 80 , 82 and 83 k. on the other hand , the temperature - dependence of the imaginary component of the fundamental harmonic was realized for 8 different field amplitudes i.e. , @xmath4077 , 118 , 277 , 690 , 1161 , 1836 , 2315 , 2665 a / m rms .",
    "the upper inset in fig .",
    "[ m23v5reimjc ] shows the curves for the @xmath2 with a systematic uncertanity of 20% . within the estimated uncertainties",
    "both the @xmath39 and the @xmath41 approaches lay in the same order of magnitude .",
    "therefore we conclude that in fact both approaches are equivalent .    taking as an input , in eqs .",
    "[ sunvolresol ] and [ sunvolimsol ] , the empirical law @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the reduced temperature , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are experimental parameters we have plotted the harmonics of voltaje .",
    "we found that in the high temperature region curves are well fitted with @xmath46 and @xmath47 and for lower temperatures the values @xmath48 and @xmath49 fit well .",
    ".,width=302 ]    in figs .",
    "[ m23v3reim ] and [ m23v5reimjc ] we plot both the measured and computed curves for the third and fifth harmonics , respectively . in the real part of the third harmonic the theory can not account for the positive peak . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part is qualitatively well described .",
    "the computed values for the fifth harmonic does not account for the oscillatory behavior on the left of the main peaks .",
    "as temperature goes down from above @xmath50 the main peaks agree with the theory but as the system further cools , some new features appear that suggest the presence of other mechanisms than pinning . the overall behavior for harmonics higher than the first proposes not only that pinning is the only mechanism implied in the dynamics of fluxons but also that thermally assisted flux flow ( taff ) and flux creep are present .",
    "also a field - dependence of @xmath51 is not accounted for in the model and it may be found in harmonics higher than the fundamental .",
    "however , s. shatz et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the kim - anderson model with @xmath52 also yields a universal behavior in the curves which in consequence does not produce the additional peaks .",
    "this fact has the importance conclusion : that the observed peaks must be caused only by thermal effects as the transition occurs .",
