    "as far as proofs of the hook content formula ( hcf ) it seems simplicity often takes a back seat to bijectivity . but a result so easily formulated should have a proof which is not overly complicated .",
    "more importantly , perhaps , a result so accessible should have a proof that is also accessible .",
    "the prerequisites for understanding the result of the hcf include such skills as counting squares and multiplying numbers .",
    "of course , it is likely impossible to give a proof which uses only such tools , but our goal here is to come as close as possible .",
    "namely , to present a proof that is simple , self - contained , and most importantly , accessible .",
    "the basic inductive approach is to first switch from thinking about semistandard young tableaux to thinking about  multi - vote \" ballot sequences  on such ballots a voter may vote for as many candidates as he likes ( including none ) .",
    "the problem is this : suppose we have a group of candidates such that no two candidates have the same height .",
    "further , suppose we know how many votes each candidate will receive as well as the total number of ballots that will be cast .",
    "then , how many ways can said ballots be cast such that , at any point in the election , a taller candidate always has more ( or the same ) votes than a shorter one ?    to answer this",
    ", we will look at the possible ways the last voter may have filled out his ballot , and investigate how each one of these hypothetical final ballots influences the possible ways the election could have proceeded up to that point .",
    "this will lead us to an obvious recursion that our answer must verify .",
    "we then present a formula which we claim _ will _ satisfy this recursion .",
    "the rest , as the saying goes , is algebra .",
