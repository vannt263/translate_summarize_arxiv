    "it is generally known to almost everyone in pv community that large area photovoltaic ( pv ) modules are often laterally nonuniform .",
    "the lateral nonuniformity can be especially strong in thin film pv , revealing itself in variations between local pv parameters in different areas of a module or in variations between the parameters of nominally identical solar cells cut from the same module .",
    "the nonuniformity causes problems with pv reliability ; it plays the role of a hidden cost of otherwise inexpensive pv technology .",
    "an established way of observing lateral nonuniformities in pv modules is infrared ( ir ) camera mapping : ir pictures of different parts of a module showing different temperatures ; these nonuniformities depend on the device current and voltage .",
    "there exists a variety of complimentary mapping techniques , which also reveal lateral nonuniformities : optical beam induced current ( obic ) , electron beam induced current ( ebic ) , surface photovoltage ( spv ) mapping , photoluminescence ( pl ) mapping , and some others ( reviews are given in refs . ) .",
    "while the interpretation of some details of these maps requires further insights , the consensus in the pv community is that the observed lateral nonuniformities are related to material / structure imperfections or nonuniform light distribution .",
    "( as an example , we have polled a number of pv scientists on the nature of ir detected hot spots : all the responses attributed them to defects . )",
    "this understanding has matured to the level of common belief .",
    "even the observed fact that the ir hot spots are typically close to the module bus bars was interpreted as an evidence of the bus bar application creating defects in the device .",
    "this understanding of hot spots has been documented in multiple publications , refs . presenting recent examples .",
    "this paper will shift the defect paradigm towards spontaneous hot spot formation in a perfectly uniform system .",
    "such hot spots appear as a result of runaway instability related to the diode - like current voltage characteristics of the device : current hogging by warmer regions makes them still warmer .",
    "@xcite    the phenomenon of current hogging belongs to a large class of runaway instabilities known in electrical engineering , chemistry ( exothermic reactions ) , astrophysics ( runaway nuclear fusion ) , where increase in temperature causes positive feedback .",
    "its understanding is most advanced for thermal explosions .",
    "@xcite in particular , it was realized that the instability starts with a hot spot @xcite resembling nucleation processes in phase transitions of the first kind ; this analogy was explored in ref . and then discussed for thin film structures .",
    "@xcite    regardless of being spontaneous , the hot spot nonuniformity deteriorates device performances as different parts of the device operate under different temperatures and can not be optimized simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , one can expect that hot spots will generate defects at exponentially higher rates compared to the surrounding cold regions .",
    "this will reverse the cause and effect relation between the defects and hot spots , the latter becoming cause rather than effect . in a long run , this scenario ( mostly beyond the scope of this paper ) will result in accumulation of permanent defects in certain local regions of pv modules and their corresponding degradation .",

    "+ 4 ) the ambient temperature and thermal conduction are important as well : ambient cooling promotes thermal runaway .",
    "+ 5 ) given the device structure , thermal runaway and its related hot spots can be numerically modeled thus allowing hot spot free device engineering .",
    "numerical algorithm developed in this work or other algorithms @xcite can be used provided that they do not impose the often assumed restriction of device uniformity in the course of modeling .",
    "+ 6 ) radiative cooling can be an important factor limiting the hot spot size and other parameters .",
    "+ 7 ) a semi - quantitative understanding of well developed hot spots can be achieved based on a system of intuitive simple equations .",
    "+ one important aspect of hot spot formation left behind the present scope is a possible role of lateral nonuniformities always present in real devices .",
    "based on the above developed understanding , one can assume that such nonuniformities can trigger the hot spot formation and their location ; yet the final parameters of these spots will be determined by the average device parameters ( except maybe some cases of extremely nonuniform structures ) .",
    "this conclusion follows from the above established fact that even in laterally uniform devices local spot heating is severe and stable enough to sustain the addition of faulty local elements .",
