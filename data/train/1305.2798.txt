    "performing useful quantum computation and simulation in the presence of unavoidable noise has been a goal long sought after .",
    "many solid steps have been taken on different physical platforms in the past decade , demonstrating for small systems elementary quantum logic @xcite , simple algorithms @xcite , error correction @xcite and quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "while the celebrated error threshold theorem @xcite guarantees the fault tolerance of a large scale quantum computer when each single operation error is reduced below a certain limit , this threshold is very hard to satisfy in a typical multi - qubit setting . to fully control the state evolution of the quantum information processor , one needs to pinpoint any individual qubit at will and manipulate it while keeping the others intact .",
    "this is a stringent requirement for almost all physical platforms .",
    "a lot of efforts have been devoted to the development of individual addressing optical beam delivery and imaging systems @xcite . assuming a gaussian profile of the beam , single qubit addressing",
    "typically requires the beam waist to be much smaller than the inter - qubit spacing , which is half the wavelength of the trapping laser in optical lattices and around one micron in a linear trapped ion chain .",
    "so subwavelength focusing beyond the diffraction limit is usually required and this makes it experimentally very challenging",
    ".    there have already been many proposals and/or demonstrations in the context of cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and linearly trapped ions @xcite . to name a few , interference of several bessel beams",
    "were proposed to form a pattern such that all but one atom locate at the nodes of laser profile in @xcite ; the sharp nonlinear atomic response and position dependent dark states in an electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) setting was exploited to enable subwavelength selectivity in various proposals @xcite and experimentally demonstrated very recently @xcite ; single spin manipulation in an optical lattice with the combination of a well focused level shifting beam and a microwave pulse was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the adaptation of composite pulse refocusing technique widely used in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and quantum information @xcite to trapped ions was considered for single - qubit operation @xcite and two - qubit operation with a special form of interaction @xcite .",
    "note the two - qubit correction scheme depends on the physical operation being carried out and requires specific form of controllable interaction , and does not reduce error for certain gate realizations .",
    "our approach is along the line of @xcite but in a different setting .",
    "we propose and provide detailed analysis for a scheme to reduce crosstalk error and achieve individual addressing with several imperfectly focused laser beams . by applying an array of beams centered at different qubits and controlling their relative amplitudes , we can achieve quantum gates with ideal fidelity even when the beam waist is comparable with or slightly larger than the inter - qubit distance .",
    "a reduction of the crosstalk error by several orders of magnitude can be achieved with only moderate increase of the required laser power .",
    "the basic idea is reminiscent of the refocusing in nmr , but works in the spatial domain using multiple beams instead of in the time domain .",
    "so we call this technique spatial refocusing . unlike @xcite ,",
    "this technique is universal and works for any quantum gate .",
    "we believe it is a valuable addition to the existing toolbox of subwavelength addressing .",
    "we consider an array of qubits with even spacing @xmath0 located at the positions @xmath1 @xmath2 .",

    ", normally we assume the laser is strongly focused so that @xmath4 for any @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) . it remains experimentally challenging to achieve this condition in multi - qubit quantum computing platforms where the spacing @xmath0 needs to be small to have sufficiently strong interaction . here , instead of strong focusing , we assume that the laser beams applied to different qubits have relative coherence . to address a single qubit ,",
    "say qubit @xmath7 at position @xmath1 , instead of just shining this qubit with @xmath8 , we apply a number of identical beams centered on its nearby qubits with relative amplitudes denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the total effective laser profile is then the convolution@xmath10for a given @xmath3 , we want to find an envelop function @xmath11 to make @xmath12 for any @xmath13 .",
    "it is desirable that @xmath9 is fast decaying so that in practice we can cut off @xmath14 in the summation of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and apply laser beams to only a few of its neighbors .",
    "if we take the normalization @xmath15 , @xmath16 then determines the relative increase of the required laser light amplitude , which is desired to be moderate for practical applications .",
    "the solution depends on the laser profile @xmath3 . to show that the idea works ,",
    "first we look at a toy model by assuming @xmath3 given by an exponential decay @xmath17 . in this case , two correction beams applied to its nearest neighbors @xmath18 and @xmath19 perfectly cancel the residue laser amplitude for all the qubits @xmath5 . to see this ,",
    "let us take @xmath20 , @xmath21 for @xmath22 , and all other @xmath23 . if we choose @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , we immediately have @xmath27 . the required increase of the laser power @xmath28 is moderate even when the original laser profile @xmath3 has a significant residue amplitude @xmath29 on the neighboring qubits .    for a general laser profile",
    "@xmath3 , if the number of qubits is large or if the envelop function @xmath30 is fast decaying so that the boundary condition is irrelevant , we can formally solve eq .",

    "we can do a series expansion with @xmath45 , and up to the order of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "one can see that the envelop function @xmath9 decays exponentially by the factor @xmath49 as one moves away from the target qubit .",
    "this result holds in general . to show this , we write eq .",
    "( 1 ) into a matrix form @xmath50 , denoting @xmath51 as @xmath52 and@xmath53 as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are integers between @xmath56 and @xmath38 . for large enough positive integers @xmath57 , @xmath58 , so we can always cut off at certain @xmath57 and set terms @xmath59 in @xmath60 to zero .",
    "the resulting @xmath60 is then a toeplitz band matrix with bandwidth @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the solution @xmath62 contains several exponential decay components with different decay constants ( see appendix for details ) , but @xmath63 characterizes the largest decay constant and in the limit of large @xmath64 a single term wins out with @xmath65 .",
    "numerical solution of the matrix equation confirms this ( see fig  [ fig : f0_fx_two_panel](a ) ) .",
    "an important implication of this result is that we can set a truncation tolerance error @xmath66 and only apply correction beams to those qubits with @xmath67",
    ". that will require about @xmath68 beams , independent of the system size .",
    "we expect this qualitative behavior to persist for any beam profile that decays quickly with the increase of distance from its center .     under different",

    "our scheme is most effective in the region @xmath91 , where it allows a reduction of the crosstalk error by several orders of magnitude with just a few correction beams while keeping the cost in the laser power still negligible .",
    "the above analysis extends straightforwardly to higher dimensional systems .",
    "moreover , neither the assumption of homogeneous spacing nor that correction beams center around each qubit is essential .",
    "we can always treat the qubits as equidistant if we effectively modify the beam profile @xmath92 or @xmath60 according to the actual qubit spacings and the focus positions of the correction lasers . for multi - qubit operations ,",
    "the relative overhead of spatial refocusing usually becomes lower .",
    "for instance , the quantum simulation of arbitrary ising interaction with @xmath38 trapped ion qubits requires @xmath93 well focused laser beams in ref . @xcite . without perfect focusing , using the scheme here we still only need @xmath94 beams .",

    "this spectral decomposition approach is particularly convenient for quantum simulation where we need to simultaneously apply focused laser beams on each ion @xcite . with spectral decomposition ,",

    "the gate fidelity is quantified by @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the assumed initial state , @xmath153 is the ideal final state and @xmath154 indicates tracing over all the motional modes .",
    "similar to real experiments , we apply gaussian beams to the target ions @xmath155 .",
    "we consider two entangling cpf gates in a @xmath156-ion chain with @xmath157 one for two center ions and the other for two ions on one edge , with the beam width about @xmath158 larger than the separation of the two center ions and @xmath159 of separation of the two edge ions .",
    "the ion spacings and laser beam width are fixed throughout the calculation .",
    "clearly the condition @xmath160 is violated in both cases .",
    "all the transverse phonon modes are assumed to be initially in thermal states with the same temperature @xmath161 such that the center of mass mode has one phonon on average , a typical situation after doppler cooling .",
    "we scan over the raman detuning @xmath140 and for each @xmath140 optimize over @xmath162 and @xmath163 to find the best possible gate fidelity .",
    "as expected , without applying correction beams the fidelity of the gate is rather low ( see the top curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid_detuning ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "however , keeping all other parameters fixed , the gate error is largely reduced by including only one correction beam and including two correction beams the fidelity gets very close to the ideal case .",
    "for the center ions , three correction beams on both sides already reduce the gate error by nearly three orders of magnitude .",
    "as shown in fig  [ fig : fid_detuning](c ) , the gate infidelity ( t1-fidelity ) caused by the crosstalk error decreases exponentially with the number of correction beams , until one approaches the optimal value set by other error sources .",
    "note that with time constant @xmath162 and @xmath163 , there is an intrinsic gate fidelity due to the lack of control knobs , shown in fig  [ fig : fid_detuning](c ) as dashed lines .",
    "the proposed spatial refocusing technique is ready to implement in many quantum computation architectures , such as harmonically trapped ion crystals @xcite or arrays of micro - traps @xcite , rydberg atoms in optical lattices @xcite , arrays of optical tweezers @xcite , etc .",
    "after measurement of qubit positions , laser focusing positions , and the laser beam profile , one only needs to apply the inverse linear transformation @xmath164 to the target beam profile @xmath165 and use the result as input to the beam delivery device . removing the need of strong focusing , this scheme should significantly simplify the required optics .",
    "another nice feature is that we do not even require each beam to center at each qubit , as long as the beam positions are known and fixed .",
    "the scheme requires coherence between the correction beams . since",
    "raman beams are used we only need to stabilize the relative phase between the raman beams .",
    "we also note that in small scale systems , the @xmath166 scaling of the number of required correction beams @xmath167 with truncation error is often irrelevant .",
    "an array of @xmath38 coherent pulses should always suffice for the generation of arbitrary laser strength profile for @xmath38 qubits .",
    "so one would never need 10 beams to address 5 qubits .    in practice ,",
    "spatial refocusing is subject to several types of experimental noise .",
    "first of all , the ions are not stationary point particles .",
    "their positions fluctuate thermally and quantum mechanically .",
    "second , the amplitudes and phases of each beam in the array may deviate from the prescription .",
    "it is unclear whether the interference is robust to these deviations .",
    "we first estimate the position fluctuations of the ions .",
    "take a 21 ion chain as example , the ion spacing vary between @xmath168 and @xmath169 with the smallest spacing in the middle of the chain . among the axial motional modes the center of mass mode has the lowest frequency , about @xmath170 and the corresponding oscillator length is @xmath171 .",
    "the other axial modes all have higher frequencies and the oscillator lengths are even smaller . assuming the doppler cooling limit , i.e. with temperature given by @xmath172 and the cooling transition linewidth @xmath173 , the center of mass mode along @xmath123 contains on average @xmath174 phonons for a trap with @xmath175 . with these realistic data ,",
    "exact numerical calculation taking all the axial modes into account shows that for each ion the standard deviation of position ranges from @xmath176 to @xmath177 , at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the inter - ion spacing .",
    "so for our purpose here the noise caused by ions thermal motion is negligible . for the second problem ,",
    "since the laser beams superpose linearly to give the final refocused pulse , an arbitrary deviation of the j - th pulse s amplitude @xmath178 only add noise @xmath179 to the final amplitude distribution @xmath180 . to consider both strength and phase error of the laser , we allow the deviation @xmath181 to be a complex number .",
    "to quantify the effect of @xmath181 , we parametrize the deviation as follows @xmath182 where the real numbers @xmath183 and @xmath184 measure respectively the relative amplitude error and phase error of the beam on ion @xmath14 .",
    "each @xmath183/@xmath184 is sampled from the normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath185/@xmath186 , i.e. @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath189 to measure the difference of actual and ideal intensity distribution .",
    "we now do a numerical simulation to investigte the robustness of the interference .",
    "we take a 21-ion chain harmonically trapped and try to address the central ion , @xmath190 .",
    "the ideal target is @xmath191 .",
    "assume the addressing beams have a gaussian profile with width the same as the distance between 11-th and 12-th ion .",

    "we found that the interference pattern is pretty robust .",
    "for 5% standard amplitude error and 0.2 radians phase error , the average intensity error @xmath193 is still below 1% . in terms of gate infidelity",

    "in summary , we have proposed a spatial refocusing technique to achieve effective individual addressing and reduce crosstalk error in a general multi - qubit platform .",

    "<S> separate addressing of individual qubits is a challenging requirement for scalable quantum computation , and crosstalk between operations on neighboring qubits remains a significant source of error for current experimental implementations of multi - qubit platforms . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a scheme based on spatial refocusing from interference of several coherent laser beams to significantly reduce the crosstalk error for any type of quantum gates . </S>",
    "<S> a general framework is developed for the spatial refocusing technique , in particular with practical gaussian beams , and we show that the crosstalk - induced infidelity of quantum gates can be reduced by several orders of magnitude with a moderate cost of a few correction laser beams under typical experimental conditions . </S>"
