    "a linear relationship between optical reddening  and the total column density of hydrogen nuclei n(h ) = n(h i ) + 2 n(@xmath4 ) is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics , with a widely - quoted constant of proportionality n(h ) @xmath5  derived from  and @xmath4  absorption against a small number of early - type stars using the _ copernicus _ satellite @xcite .",
    "the same constant of proportionality is implicit in the definition of the  standard ",
    "h i cloud of @xcite .",
    "this relationship was at first extended over the sky using galaxy counts to measure optical extinction @xcite ( bh82 ; see also @xcite ) and more recently using far infrared ( fir ) dust emission - derived measures from higher - resolution ( 6 ) all - sky surveys @xcite ( sfd98 ) .",
    "for the atomic hydrogen column density , the all - sky , stray radiation- corrected lab 21 cm h i emission survey @xcite with 0.6resolution on a 0.5  grid stands in for  absorption .",
    "mm - wave co emission surveys @xcite have been used as surrogates for @xmath4  at higher reddening  @xmath6 0.1 mag where the @xmath4fraction is appreciable @xcite and n(h ) necessarily diverges from n(h i ) .",
    "the @xmath4-fraction has also been estimated using 2n(@xmath4 ) = @xmath7  - n(h i ) @xcite , partly as a means of calibrating the so - called co-@xmath4  conversion factor .",
    "the subject of this work is the relationship between n(h i ) derived from 21 cm measurements and  at 0.02 mag @xmath8  @xmath8 0.1 mag . in this regime",
    "the @xmath4-fraction is small , the hydrogen is predominantly neutral and atomic and the optical depth in the 21 cm h i line is low .",
    "thus all of the commonly - considered systematic errors in deriving n(h i ) are minimized and there should be little difficulty in demonstrating the proportionality between n(h i ) _ cum _ n(h ) and .",
    "however , we find that the slope of the n(h i)-  relationship is very different from that expected , typically by about 40% , over large and small regions of the sky , at low and high spatial resolution , no matter which recent h i survey is considered .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our use of the various h i and reddening measures and databases . in section 3",
    "we show the n(h i)-  relationships that result . in section 4",
    "we discuss some recent and historical antecedents for adjusting the /n(h i ) relationship and figure 5 is a brief summary presenting the alternatives that suggest themselves for understanding the present results .",
    "for comparison with n(h i ) we derived reddening values at the nearest pixel in the sfd98 datacubes ( north and south ) and made sure to check our values against those served online given the unexpected nature of the plots we produced .",
    "the sfd98 datacubes present equivalents of the optical reddening  derived from far infrared dust emission at 6  resolution on a 2.5  pixel grid , with a stated error of 16% at each pixel .",
    "we also compared the sfd98 results with those from the work of bh82 , on the gridpoints of the latter , ie spaced 0.6  in galactic latitude and 0.3  in longitude .",
    "we derived n(h",
    "i ) from brightness temperature profiles of 21 cm radiation , lightly correcting for optical depth using a spin temperature of 145 k , which corresponds to the mean ratio of 21 cm emission and absorption @xcite in the millenium h i emission - absorption survey of @xcite .",
    "the correction to n(h i ) for h i optical depth is never more than a few percent at n(h i ) @xmath9 ,  @xmath8 0.08 mag where the disparity between the canonically - scaled  and n(h i ) is most clearly manifest .",
    "the upward correction for the possible contribution of ionized hydrogen is ignored here , but it would only exaggerate the effects that are discussed .    on large scales we used the lab all - sky ,",
    "stray - radiation corrected survey data @xcite that has 0.6  spatial resolution on a pixel grid spaced 0.5 , with a velocity resolution of 1.3 .",
    "we checked our profile integrals against those from the online lab survey server .",
    "we also derived n(h i ) over smaller regions using cubes of h i profiles from the galfa - hi survey @xcite that has 4  resolution on a 1  pixel grid with 0.8  velocity resolution .",
    "we confirmed that the galfa and lab surveys are on the same intensity scale by synthesizing a few spectra at 0.6  resolution at positions corresponding to lab survey pixels , using galfa data .",
    "the dashed line is the canonical scaling n(h i ) = @xmath7 , as in figure 1.,height=317 ]      figure 1 shows the results of plotting scaled values of n(h i)/@xmath10 vs  from sfd98 .",
    "we sampled around the entire sky at the 720 longitude gridpoints of the lab survey , ie at even 0.5  intervals of galactic longitude at b = @xmath1120 , @xmath1135 , @xmath1150   and @xmath1160 , to cover a wide range in n(h i ) and ; we used the nearest datapoint in the 2.5-pixel datacubes of sfd98 .",
    "figure 1 shows the data on a wider log scale at left and at smaller  on a linear scale at right .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 1 are the canonical scaling relationship",
    "n(h i)/@xmath10 =  which should hold at lower  where the @xmath4  fraction is small @xcite . a regression fit to the data at 0.015 @xmath12  @xmath12 0.07 mag is log(y ) = @xmath13 log ( ) where y = n(h i)/@xmath10 .    as shown at right",
    "there is a small non - zero y - intercept to a linear fit , y = 0.00363 + 1.3581  or  = -0.00267+n(h i)/@xmath14 which is very similar to an implicit result in @xcite , as noted here in section 4.2 .",
    "a formal fit for the mean displacement between the regression lines and the canonical scaling is a factor 1.43 , ie a mean slope dn(h i)/d",
    "= @xmath15 .",
    "note that the putative displacement can not be discerned at  @xmath6 0.12 mag , in part because the @xmath4  fraction is appreciable and partly because the optical depth at 21 cm is not compensated in the attendant cooler gas .    as a check ,",
    "figure 2 shows that the reddening derived from the sfd98 datacubes is already larger than that of bh82 , except over a narrow range at 0.06 @xmath8  @xmath8 0.1 mag .",
    "recent suggestions for corrections to the sfd98 results @xcite imply an overall decrease of 10 - 15% in the sfd98 reddening that would somewhat ameliorate the differences between sfd98 and bh82 while increasing the value we derive for n(h i)/  by the same amount .    given the behaviour in figure 2 it is interesting to contemplate what figure 1 would have looked like if had been constructed just before the appearance of sfd98 .",
    "the reddenings of bh82 do not increase much beyond  = 0.2 mag , so that the broad wing extending to high  in figure 1 would have been compressed and pushed back to the regression line . at small",
    "the reddening of bh82 declines much faster than that of sfd98 , leading to high values of the gas / dust ratio as noted in section 4.2 .",
    "table 1 shows some summary properties for the data displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the southern sky consistently has 20 - 30% more gas at @xmath16 , a well - known aspect of galactic structure @xcite .",
    "the h i/  ratio is more consistent in the north but steadily increasing with @xmath17 in the south .",
    "some part of that increase could be explained by colder gas and a stronger correction for saturation in the h i but it also appears that the extra gas in the south is not accompanied by a full complement of added reddening . in any case",
    ", table 1 gives some idea of the expected variability in n(h)/  at / above 35  where the opacity correction is small ; nearly none in the northern sky and 15 - 20          as a check on the wide - scale results from the lab survey , we considered regions mapped at 4  resolution in the galfa - hi survey of @xcite . shown in figures 3 and 4 are results derived from two custom 5@xmath185  cubes delivered by the galfa data server .",
    "figure 3 shows the n(h i ) -  comparison for a region at b @xmath19 - 33  that was specifically selected from a reddening map to avoid sightlines with  @xmath20 0.1 .",
    "the formal value of the displacement of the data from the canonical scaling is a factor 1.53 , slightly larger than in figure 1 .",
    "shown at left in figure 4 are overlays of the reddening ( in pseudo - color ) and contours of the h i profile integral for a region specifically chosen to contain a wide range in reddening and portions of the high - latitude co - emitting cloud mbm53 @xcite .",
    "this part of the sky near the mbm53 - 55 complex harbors a relatively large @xmath4-fraction even in regions where  @xmath21 mag @xcite .",
    "although the  map and the contours of the h i profile integral correspond quite closely , the plot at right in fig .",
    "4 makes clear that the range of the h i column density is very much compressed compared to that of the reddening .",
    "the h i profiles are depressed by the presence of cold gas and a high molecular fraction at relatively small   but n(h i ) still lies well above the dashed line representing the canonical scaling between n(h ) and  at smaller values of .",
    "we noted in section 3.1 and figure 2 that the sfd98 results are generally larger than those of bh82 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite derived a 14% downward overall scaling of the sfd98 results and they and @xcite discuss corrections to the sfd98 reddening as well as a normalization difference between the north and south hemispheres of about 20% .",
    "downward scaling of the sfd98 results would lessen some of the differences seen in figure 2 while exacerbating the disparity in the -n(h i ) comparison discussed here .",
    "@xcite argued that the sfd98 reddening could be low by as much as 50% over limited portions of the sky where the dust temperature is low but generally confirmed the sfd98 values otherwise .",
    "with respect to the radio data , the effect manifested in figures 1 , 3 and 4 is not subtle and it is perhaps surprising that it has not been previously called out .",
    "however , the effect can be found in the literature in various ways when it is sought ; for instance figure 4 of @xcite where the sfd98 reddening is uniformly too small outside the molecular regions , compared to the canonically - scaled n(h i ) .",
    "this is as expected from the plot in figure 1 , showing the suppression of the h i profile integral for  @xmath6 0.1 mag .",
    "@xcite related both  and a scaled representation of the optically thin values of n(h i ) to his galaxy - color - derived reddening measure over a wide region around the north galactic cap .",
    "the implied -n(h i ) relationship from his equations 1 and 2 is  @xmath22n(h i)@xmath23 , very similar to the linear fit to the data shown in figure 1 , as noted in section 3.1 . at  = 0.06",
    "mag one has n(h",
    "i)/  = @xmath24/mag , tantamount to a 37% rescaling of the h i-  ratio , compared to our fitted value of 43% using ( lightly ) optical - depth corrected n(h i ) in figure 1 .    in the original discussion of @xcite",
    "it was noted that the slope of the n(h i)-  relationship derived from contemporaneous 21 cm h i measurements and galaxy counts was somewhat smaller , dn(h i)/d  = @xmath25 mag@xmath26 in @xcite .",
    "this was consistent with the comparison between  and n(h i ) derived from the  line , see just below .",
    "however , although the slope was correctly quoted , the discussion of @xcite glosses over an important aspect of the regression fit derived by @xcite ,  = @xmath27 + n(h i)/@xmath28 . regardless of whether the negative intercept is physically - based",
    ", as @xcite suggested might be the case ( ie , gas without dust ) , it reflects very large ratios n(h i)/  at low , for instance n(h i)/  = @xmath29 mag@xmath26 at  = 0.06 mag , quite in line with the present discussion .",
    "the n(h i ) data of @xcite derived from  absorption are shown in figure 5 and the behaviour is mostly opposite to that displayed in figure 1 here . at lower",
    "the scatter is larger and the h i column densities are below @xmath7 .",
    "it was well understood that the sightlines selected for _ uv _ absorption measurements by _ copernicus _ had low mean density and were biased toward lower @xmath4-fractions @xcite .",
    "this in part explains the near coincidence of n(h i ) and the canonical scaling of  at @xmath6 0.1 mag in figure 5 , well beyond the point at which  and n(h i ) diverge in figure 1 .",
    "however , assuming a fixed gas / dust ratio , there would be no reason to correct the derived n(h)/  for a small @xmath4  fraction if both n(h",
    "i ) and n(@xmath4 ) were accurately measured , no matter the sample biases .",
    "the somewhat small values of n(h i)/  at  @xmath30 mag in figure 5 could be explained by adding a 15% contribution for hydrogen that is ionized along the sightlines to those early - type stars : @xcite quote n(h i)/@xmath31 mag@xmath26 ) .",
    "however , aligning the radio and _ uv _ results below  = 0.1 mag in this same way would require a very large contribution from ionized gas , of order 60% of the observed n(h i ) derived from .",
    "alternatively , the grains observed toward these stars may actually be different .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) used archival iue spectra and expanded the sample of n(h i ) derived from  absorption by about a factor 5 .",
    "they quote n(h i)/@xmath32 mag@xmath26 at @xmath6 0.1 mag , just as in @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath8 0.1 mag their measurements give much higher n(h i)/ , more in line with what we derive , and opposite to the data of @xcite shown here in figure 5 .",
    "we compared ir - derived measures of  and n(h i ) derived from wide - field h i sky surveys at low ( 36 ; figure 1 ) and high ( 4 , figures 3 and 4 ) spatial resolution in the 21 cm line and found a 40%-50% displacement between the resultant n(h i)/  ratio @xmath33 mag@xmath26 and the usually - quoted scaling n(h ) @xmath5 , at least at  @xmath1 0.1 mag where the @xmath4  fraction is low and little saturation of the h i profiles is evident . in any case , the commonly - cited systematic errors in deriving n(h i ) from the h i profile , and the systematic deviations of n(h ) and n(h i ) to account for the contribution of ionized gas , would all increase the hydrogen column density and exaggerate the disparity between the two scaling relations .    along the way we digressed to note that the ir dust emission - derived reddening is already larger than that derived from earlier all sky surveys of galaxy counts and that recent suggestions for recalibration of the reddening would lessen the disparity with earlier studies of galaxy counts but widen it with respect to our h i measure .",
    "we showed that there have been intimations of a high 21 cm - n(h i)/  ratio for  @xmath8 0.1 mag for some time but that a somewhat opposite effect was seen in _ uv _  measurements of n(h i ) toward early - type stars .",
    "there is no doubt that the gas column density and dust optical depth are well and , apparently , linearly correlated on large scales at  @xmath1 0.1 mag , but the coefficient of proportionality seems to have been mis - estimated by a surprisingly large amount , for a surprisingly long while .",
    "if the fir - derived  and 21 cm - derived n(h i ) have been measured correctly , they imply a 30% decrease in the accepted galactic /n(h ) ratio at  @xmath1 0.08 mag where n(h i ) @xmath34 n(h ) . moreover , the obvious sources of possible error , opacity in the h i and the unobserved contribution of h ii , both go in the direction of increasing the disparity .",
    "conversely , if the stellar reddening and _ uv _ absorption measurements of h i and @xmath4  are also accurate , either a very large contribution from ionized gas was neglected toward the early - type stars or the dust optical depths per h - nucleus are larger than in the galaxy at large .    in a subsequent paper",
    "we will discuss the physical reasons for the divergence between n(h i ) and the linear -n(h i ) scaling at  @xmath8 0.1 mag . by considering the h i profiles and the established empirical relationship between  and the integrated h i optical depth , it is straightforward to show that saturation of the 21 cm line is much less important than the conversion of hydrogen atoms to @xmath4 .",
