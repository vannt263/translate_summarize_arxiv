    "additional characteristics that are desirable in the kerr microscope are high sensitivity , high spatial resolution and possibility of cryogenic operation . the sensitivity of the kerr microscope is given by the minimum kerr rotation angle that can be measured and is typically of the order of a few @xmath1rad .",
    "high spatial resolution can be achieved with objective lenses of very short focal distance . the spatial resolution _",

    "this is in conflict with the convenience of utilizing high - quality microscope objectives at room temperature .",
    "the possibility of cryogenic operation is important , among other reasons , because spin relaxation rates tend to be strongly temperature dependent .",

    "the insert is placed inside the magneto - optical cryostat , requiring all parts to perform well at low temperatures and high magnetic fields . a picture of the insert with all parts indicated is shown in fig .",
    "[ insert ] .",
    "the insert consists of a cylindrical copper housing fixed at the end of the sample rod supplied with the magneto - optical cryostat .",
    "the cylinder diameter is 25 mm .",

    "the special lens holder ensures that no stress is applied to the lens due to thermal contraction of the materials during cool down .",

    "the sample is mounted on a modified ceramic chip carrier with eight electrical lead contacts and placed approximately in the focal plane of the objective lens .",
    "the chip carrier is mounted on an all - polyimide frame .",
    "the frame material was chosen to have low thermal contraction and good electrical isolation properties .",
    "eight spring - loaded pins mounted on the frame make electrical contact with the leads in the chip carrier .",
    "in addition , the spring force of the pins holds the chip carrier in a fixed position in the polyimide frame and allows changing the samples easily by simply placing a different chip carrier into the frame . a cernox temperature sensor ( lakeshore cx-1050-sd , not visible in the figure ) is placed on the frame in order to accurately monitor the temperature of the sample .",

    "proper selection of the objective lens in the insert is decisive to the performance of the microscope .",

    "it is necessary to ensure nearly diffraction - limited spots not only on - axis but also off - axis . in this case",
    "it is essential to minimize comatic aberration .",
    "the detrimental effects of spherical aberration can be minimized by utilizing specially designed aspheric lenses .",
    "a wide range of small diameter high - na aspheric lenses designed for wavelengths in the vicinity of 800 nm are commercially available . in order to choose the proper lens for the kerr microscope geometrical ray tracing calculations of selected aspheric lenses",
    "were performed .",
    "incoming parallel rays , both marginal and paraxial , were traced through the lenses at different wavelengths within the laser spectrum .",
    "subsequently the diameter of the focal spot for each lens was calculated when focusing the beams on - axis and off - axis .",
    "the parameters that entered the calculation are the known refractive index values of the lens material , the incoming light wavelengths and the aspheric coefficients for both lens surfaces .",
    "a detailed comparison was made for two aspheric lenses designed for 830 nm with numerical aperture 0.68 , one biconvex ( lightpath 350330 ) and one plano - convex ( lightpath 350390 ) . the calculations revealed that with the biconvex lens on - axis diffraction - limited spot size can be achieved at the design wavelength ( spherical aberration - free ) .",
    "in contrast , the plano - convex lens causes some spherical aberration even at the design wavelength .",
    "plano - convex lenses , however , have minimum comatic and spherical aberrations when focusing a collimated beam .",
    "in fact , comatic aberration of the biconvex lens was calculated to be much larger than that of the plano - convex lens . by taking this into account",
    "the plano - convex lens was chosen to be most appropriate for the kerr microscope . according to our calculations for the plano - convex lens , the combined spherical and chromatic aberrations ( for 10 nm spectral bandwidth ) increase the diameter of the on - axis spot by only @xmath06@xmath6 compared to the diffraction - limited case .",

    "the edge of the gold pad is moved across the focused beam and the reflected light intensity is measured as a function of the lateral displacement of the gold pad .    utilizing the knife - edge technique ,",
    "the focused spot profile was measured at temperatures 4.2 k and 300 k for a laser beam with spectrum centered at 820 nm and spectral fwhm of 10 nm .",

    "pump and probe spots were overlapped and had slightly larger diameters than the optimum values measured before .",
    "oscillations of the kerr angle in the trkr trace are due to precession of the optically oriented spins in the applied magnetic field . from the measured precession frequency @xmath14 , the effective g - factor @xmath15 of conduction electrons can be obtained utilizing the relation :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is bohr s magneton , @xmath18 is the applied magnetic field , and @xmath19 is planck s constant .",

    "a net spin polarization remains even after electron - hole recombiation @xcite , in which case @xmath22 can effectively be regarded as being infinite .",
    "if this is not the case , the total decay time - constant of the kerr signal @xmath23 will be given by : @xmath24 . additionally",
    ", the observed kerr rotation signal may decay due to diffusion of spin polarized electrons out of the area covered by the focused probe beam .",
    "this mechanism is important when the area of the focused probe beam is comparable to or less than @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the carrier diffusion constant .",
    "this mechanism of signal decay must be taken into account when measuring with tightly focused beams as is the case with the microscope described here .    to separate the different contributions to the decay of the total spin signal it is necessary to perform additional experiments .",
    "isolating the spin ( @xmath21 ) and electronic ( @xmath22 ) contributions to @xmath23 requires independently measuring the carrier dynamics .",
    "a transient reflectance experiment measures the dynamics of photoexcited carriers irrespective of their spin polarization from which @xmath22 can be determined . changing from a trkr configuration to a transient reflectance configuration",
    "can be done simply by replacing the photoelastic - modulator with an optical chopper and measuring changes in the total reflected probe intensity induced by excitation with a linearly polarized pump pulse . the carrier diffusion constant @xmath26 can be determined by a transport measurement or utilizing the ability of the microscope to excite ( spin polarized ) carriers in one location and probe them a certain distance away as will be discussed below .",
    "a remarkable feature of the instrument described here is its ability to measure transport of spin polarized electrons under high magnetic fields .",
    "high magnetic fields are crucial , for example , in order to distinguish between different electron populations with slightly different values of @xmath27 .",

    "figure [ sixmicron].a shows the trkr signal obtained in this configuration at 7 tesla and 4.2 k. subsequently , the pump spot was displaced away from the probe spot . in this configuration ,",
    "the spot profiles and separation were measured by the knife edge technique described earlier ( inset in fig .",

    "spot diameters ( fwhm ) were measured to be @xmath01.9 @xmath1 m and @xmath03.4 @xmath1 m for the pump and probe respectively .",
    "the difference in spot diameters is due to the different central wavelengths of the two beams ( 780 nm and 820 nm for the pump and probe respectively ) and chromatic aberration from the single - element objective lens .",

    "[ sixmicron ] . with overlapped pump and probe spots ( plot ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ sixmicron ] ) , the amplitude of the kerr signal decays monotonically with time .",
    "this is determined both by the decay of spin polarization and by the diffusion of carriers away from the area covered by the pump and probe beams .",
    "the spin polarized carriers that diffuse away from the area covered by the pump are detected when measured with non - overlapped spots .",
    "the time it takes for the carriers to diffuse 6 @xmath1 m gives rise to the slow increase in the amplitude of the envelope of the kerr signal that peaks at a delay of approximately 400 ps .",
    "in addition , as will be discussed below , the kerr signal with separated pump and probe shows coherence up to much longer delays .",
    "it is important to note that diffusion takes place predominantly in the plane of the sample and not along the growth direction because the multilayer buffer between the sample substrate and accumulation layer acts as a barrier for carrier diffusion .",
    "fourier analysis of the data taken with non - overlapped spots reveal that only electrons with @xmath29 , that is bulk gaas electrons , are observed in this measurement .",
    "the signal obtained with non - overlapped spots can be modeled assuming that the width of the gaussian profile of the carrier density excited by the pump pulse increases with time due to carrier diffusion with diffusion constant @xmath26 .",
    "as spin polarized carriers diffuse radially , some enter the region covered by the probe spot increasing the amplitude of the kerr signal .",
    "spin relaxation also takes place , which ultimately causes a decrease in the kerr signal amplitude .",
    "analysis of the data reveals that the kerr signal decay time - constant @xmath23 is @xmath0700 ps and the diffusion constant @xmath26 is @xmath070 @xmath13/s .",
    "this value of the diffusion constant is consistent with the conclusion that only bulk gaas spins contribute to the observed signal since the diffusion constant of 2deg electrons is more than an order of magnitude larger .",
    "time - resolved kerr rotation measured with large diameter ( @xmath30100 @xmath1 m ) overlapped spots is insensitive to signal loss due to diffusion of carriers out of the area covered by the laser spots .",
    "experiments with large spots on the same sample and under similar conditions to those discussed above @xcite yield a @xmath23 no larger than 300 ps .",
    "this is more than two times shorter than the @xmath23 retrieved from the measurements with non - overlapped spots .",
    "the reason for the slower spin relaxation rate observed with non - overlapped spots is probably that spin polarized electrons become spatially separated from holes due to their larger diffusion constant .",
    "electron spin - flips due to electron - hole scattering has been shown to be an important spin relaxation mechanism in gaas quantum - wells @xcite .",
    "the kerr signal decay time constant of 2deg electrons decreases as the excitation density @xmath31 increases@xcite approximately as @xmath32 .",
    "this is the reason that at high photon densities only electrons with @xmath33 , i.e. , electrons in bulk gaas , contribute to the kerr signal . at low photoexcitation densities spin",

    "plot ( a ) shows measurements with pump and probe spots focused along the same channel as depicted in the inset . two spin populations contribute to the total kerr signal as evidenced by the beating pattern and by the fourier spectrum of this data , shown in plot ( c ) .",
    "the high frequency population ( @xmath042 ghz ) corresponds to electrons in bulk gaas .",
    "the low frequency population ( @xmath032 ghz ) corresponds to electrons in the 2deg that diffuse along the quasi-1d channel from the area covered by the pump spot to the probed area .",

    "fourier transform of this trace , plot ( d ) , presents a single peak corresponding to electrons with @xmath33 .",
    "electron diffusion through the 2deg is inhibited by the ridges defining the quasi-1d structures .",
    "thus , only electrons diffusing from the area covered by the pump spot through the underlying bulk gaas reach the probed area .",

    "a grating structure with 1.6 @xmath1 m period was fabricated on the sample surface by lithography and wet chemical etching .",
    "200 nm wide and 120 nm deep ridges defined channels on the 2deg of 1.4 @xmath1 m width and 180 @xmath1 m length .",

    "bulk electrons diffuse isotropically in the plane normal to the growth direction .",
    "quasi-1d electrons , on the other hand , diffuse only along the channel because the ridges of the grating confine the carriers to remain within the channel .",
    "for this reason , when the probe spot is focused on a different channel than the pump pulse , no kerr response from the 2deg is observed .",
    "figure [ alongacross].b shows the trkr signal measured with pump and probe spots separated by @xmath04 @xmath1 m but each one focused on a different channel .",
    "the fourier spectrum of this measurement , fig .",

    "this experiment demonstrates that the kerr microscope can measure transport of spin polarization at distances as short as 4 @xmath1 m .",
    "the ability to resolve spin transport with such high spatial resolution is essential , for example , for measuring ballistic spin transport where the relevant length scale is of the order of the electron mean free path .",
    "in this article a compact cryogenic sample - scanning microscope designed for static and time - resolved kerr rotation measurements in high magnetic fields is described .",
    "the instrument has spatial resolution of @xmath01 @xmath1 m and temporal resolution utilizing the full laser spectrum of 20 fs .",
    "the microscope features the capability of easily changing from voigt configuration to faraday configuration due to the use of compact optics and translation systems on the insert of a magneto - optical cryostat with split - coil magnet .",
    "the instrument is designed for measuring spin transport in micro and nanostructures and can thus polarize and probe spins at different locations on a device .",
    "the capabilities of the microscope were demonstrated by measuring transport of spin polarization by quasi-1d electrons over micrometer distances such that we can now explore ballistic transport .",
    "for these experiments high spatial resolution , high magnetic field operation and the ability to spatially separate pump and probe spots on the sample are necessary .    the power and versatility of the kerr microscope described above anticipate diverse applications in spintronics such as tracing of spin packet transport in spintronic circuits , investigation of spin - filtering of electric currents in interconnected wire structures @xcite , mapping the effect of anisotropic spin - orbit fields on spin diffusion in 2d electron systems @xcite and characterization of ballistic spin transport .",
