    "the standard model of elementary particle physics ( sm ) is a very successful model which explains @xmath4(100 )  gev physics .",
    "however , we must consider beyond the sm because several phenomena such as neutrino oscillation  @xcite , dark matter ( dm )  @xcite and baryon asymmetry of universe  @xcite can not be explained by the sm .",
    "the neutrino oscillation can be explained by tiny neutrino masses .",
    "the simplest method to obtain these masses is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite with right - handed majorana neutrinos ( the type - i seesaw scenario ) . in this mechanism ,",
    "right - handed neutrino masses are @xmath4(@xmath5 )  gev for @xmath4(1 ) neutrino dirac yukawa couplings",
    ". however , these heavy right - handed neutrinos would be difficult to detected at future experiments .",
    "on the other hand , if tiny neutrino masses are generated at the loop level , new particle masses can be @xmath4(1 )  tev with sizable coupling constants .",
    "moreover , this mechanism is often applied to the models with the @xmath6 parity or an u(1 ) symmetry to forbid tree - level neutrino masses and to guarantee the stability of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "if dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , its mass is naively estimated to be of @xmath4(100 - 1000 )  gev by the wmap data  @xcite .",
    "such a mass scale for the dark matter may be naturally generated by the vacuum expectation value with respect to the spontaneous break down at the tev - scale of an additional gauge symmetry .",
    "let us consider the radiative seesaw model in which spontaneous breaking of the u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry at the tev scale gives the common origin for masses of neutrinos and dark matter  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the stability of dark matter is realized by the global u(1)@xmath1 symmetry which arises by b@xmath2l charge assignment . in this model ,",
    "right - handed neutrinos obtain tev - scale majorana masses at the tree level , while dirac masses of neutrinos are generated via one - loop diagrams where the dark matter is running in the loop .",
    "consequently , tiny neutrino masses are generated at the two - loop level by the seesaw mechanism .",
    "this model gives characteristic predictions , such as light decayable right - handed neutrinos , dirac fermion wimp dark matter and an extra heavy vector boson with the mass to be the tev scale .",
    "these new particles would be accessible at collider experiments so that the model would be testable .",
    "for example , the lhc may be able to detect the u(1)@xmath0 gauge boson ( @xmath7 ) with the mass up to about 4  tev with the u(1)@xmath0 gauge coupling constant about 0.1  @xcite .",
    "however , it would be challenging to test the other new particles in this model at the lhc unless the @xmath7 boson is sufficiently light , because they only couple to the @xmath7 boson and leptons so that their discovery strongly depends on the mass of the @xmath7 boson .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a possibility of testing this model at future electron - positron linear colliders  @xcite .",
    "differently from the hadron collider , new dirac fermions can be produced directly from the @xmath8 collision , whose sequential decays can contain production of right - handed neutrinos with the dark matter .",
    "the dark matter can also be directly produced in association with charged inert scalar bosons from leptons .",
    "we find that for the center - of - mass energy being @xmath9  gev with the integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath10 , the dirac fermion dark matter can be detected as long as its mass is less than about 64  gev .",
    "for the center - of - mass energy @xmath11  gev with the same luminosity , the dark matter with the mass of @xmath4(100 )  gev can be detected .",
    "moreover , at the linear collider with @xmath12  tev with 3 ab@xmath10 right - handed neutrinos can be tested .",
    "therefore , this model can be identified by the combination of these future experiments .",

    "<S> we discuss phenomenology of the radiative seesaw model in which spontaneous breaking of the u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry at the tev scale gives the common origin for masses of neutrinos and dark matter  @xcite . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the stability of dark matter is realized by the global u(1)@xmath1 symmetry which arises by the b@xmath2l charge assignment . </S>",
    "<S> right - handed neutrinos obtain tev scale majorana masses at the tree level . </S>",
    "<S> dirac masses of neutrinos are generated via one - loop diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , tiny neutrino masses are generated at the two - loop level by the seesaw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this model gives characteristic predictions , such as light decayable right - handed neutrinos , dirac fermion dark matter and an extra heavy vector boson . </S>",
    "<S> these new particles would be accessible at collider experiments because their masses are at the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> the u(1)@xmath0 vector boson may be found at the lhc , while the other new particles could only be tested at future linear colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dark matter can be observed at a linear collider with @xmath3=500  gev and that light right - handed neutrinos can also be probed with @xmath3=1  tev .    , </S>"
