    "in this section we sketch the more or less standard construction that allows one to reduce the enumeration problem of meromorphic functions to a combinatorial problem of enumerating constellations . in the sequel",
    "we will be concerned with the latter problem .",
    "the construction is based on the riemann existence theorem , exposed , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "consider a compact connected riemann surface @xmath1 and a non - constant meromorphic function @xmath2 on it .",
    "the function @xmath2 can be considered as a ramified covering of the riemann sphere @xmath0 by the surface @xmath1 .",
    "denote by @xmath3 the _ finite _ ramification points of the covering .",
    "( the point @xmath4 might also be a ramification point . )",
    "let @xmath5 be a finite non - critical value of @xmath2 .",
    "choose @xmath6 non - intersecting paths on the plane , connecting @xmath7 to the points @xmath8 .",
    "the cyclic order of the paths at the point @xmath7 should be equal to the order @xmath9 .",
    "a _ star of loops _ on the complex plane is a set of @xmath6 non - intersecting closed loops @xmath10 of the following form .",
    "each loop @xmath11 starts at @xmath7 , follows the path from @xmath7 to @xmath12 , goes around @xmath12 in the counterclockwise direction , and then goes back to @xmath7 following the path .",
    "a star of loops is shown in figure  [ loopstar ] .    in the sequel",
    "we suppose that the points @xmath13 and the star of loops are fixed once and for all .",
    "the preimage under @xmath2 of the loop @xmath11 surrounding the critical value @xmath12 is composed of several curvilinear polygons on the riemann surface @xmath1 .",
    "the vertices of the polygon are the preimages of @xmath7 .",
    "its sides are the preimages of the loop @xmath11 .",
    "each polygon surrounds a unique point @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "if the polygon has more than one side , the corresponding point is critical ; if it has only one side , it is not .",
    "now we take the preimages of all the loops @xmath11 and erase all the 1-gons .",
    "we say that the polygons that compose the preimage of @xmath11 are of _ color _ @xmath16 .",
    "thus , on @xmath1 , we obtain a graph consisting of polygons colored in @xmath6 colors , each polygon having at least 2 sides and surrounding exactly one critical point of @xmath2 .",
    "the vertices of the polygons are the preimages of @xmath7 .",
    "the polygons meeting at a vertex are all of different colors , and the cyclic order of the polygons meeting at a vertex is given by the increasing order of colors .",
    "@xmath6-constellation _ is a connected colored oriented graph consisting of oriented polygons ( with at least 2 sides each ) colored in @xmath6 colors ( from @xmath17 to @xmath6 ) and such that no two polygons of the same color share a common vertex",
    ".    a constellation can be uniquely ( up to a homeomorphism ) embedded into a ( compact connected oriented ) surface in such a way that ( i ) if we cut the surface along the constellation we obtain a union of domains homeomorphic to open discs , ( ii ) every polygon of the constellation surrounds one such disc and is oriented counterclockwise with respect to this disc , ( iii ) the cyclic order of polygons meeting at every vertex coincides with the increasing order of colors .",
    "the embedding satisfying the conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) is called the _ natural embedding _ of a constellation .",
    "it follows from riemann s existence theorem that ( once the star of loops is fixed ) a constellation uniquely determines the couple @xmath18 up to a biholomorphic equivalence .",
    "the part of @xmath1 exterior to the polygons consists of several connected components corresponding to the poles of @xmath2 .",
    "they will be called _",
    "if @xmath1 is a sphere and @xmath2 a polynomial , the corresponding constellation is of a particular form , because @xmath19 is always a critical value of @xmath2 and its only preimage is @xmath19 .",
    "one can easily see that the constellation is , in that case , a planar `` tree '' consisting of colored polygons .",
    "such a constellation is called a cactus .",
    "a _ @xmath6-cactus _ is a constellation that has no cycles other than the polygons it is glued from .    the surface of the natural embedding of a cactus is a sphere .",
    "once a star of loops is fixed , a cactus determines the polynomial @xmath2 uniquely up to a change of variable @xmath20 .",
    "thus the problem of enumerating meromorphic functions can be reduced to a combinatorial problem of enumerating cacti and constellations , and we will concentrate on the latter problem from now on .",
    "the idea of this section is to replace by circles the polygons that compose cacti and constellations .",
    "the circles will be endowed with elements of length .",
    "this corresponds to letting the numbers of sides of the polygons tend to infinity .",
    "the number of cacti or constellations will be replaced by the volume of the space of possible gluings of circles .",
    "it turns out that these volumes are easier to compute then the numbers of cacti and constellations .",
    "a _ circle constellation _ is an oriented colored graph with nonnegative lengths assigned to all edges , obtained by gluing together ( at a finite number of points ) several circles of given lengths colored in @xmath6 colors from @xmath17 to @xmath6 .",
    "two circles of the same color can not share a common point .",
    "a _ circle cactus _ is a constellation of circles that has no cycles other than the circles themselves .",
    "as above , a circle constellation ( or a circle cactus ) has a unique natural embedding into a compact surface ( a sphere ) , satisfying the same three conditions as for ordinary constellations : ( i ) if we cut the surface along the circles we obtain a union of domains homeomorphic to open discs , ( ii ) each circle of the circle constellation surrounds one such disc and is oriented counterclockwise with respect to it , ( iii ) the cyclic order of circles at every vertex coincides with the increasing order of colors .",
    "the connected components of the part of the surface exterior to the circles are called _ faces_.",
    "suppose a set of @xmath21 oriented colored circles with fixed lengths is given .",
    "let us fix a genus @xmath22 and a number of faces @xmath23 .",
    "we can then consider the space of all possible gluings of the circles that give a circle constellation with @xmath23 faces on a surface of genus @xmath22 .",
    "the set of circle constellations of genus @xmath22 with @xmath23 faces glued of a given set of @xmath21 circles has a natural structure of a singular smooth noncompact manifold of dimension @xmath24 with a volume measure .    [ [ proof . ] ] proof .",
    "+ + + + + +    first we will describe the space of circle constellations with numbered vertices .",
    "such constellations do not have nontrivial automorphisms , which simplifies the description .",
    "let us describe the smooth part of the space of circle constellations .",
    "a circle constellation belongs to the smooth part if all its circles intersect only two by two . in other words ,",
    "three circles never share a common vertex .",
    "let @xmath25 be the lengths of the arcs into which one of the circles is divided by the vertices .",
    "the sum of these lengths is equal to the length of the circle ( which is fixed ) , but , for example , the first @xmath26 lengths can take arbitrary values in an open domain in @xmath27 .",
    "thus , taking for each circle the lengths of all its arcs except one , we obtain a set of local coordinates of the space of circle constellations .",
    "it is easy to check that the total number of these arcs is indeed equal to @xmath28 .",
    "now consider a smooth family of circle constellations depending on a parameter @xmath29 , such that , as @xmath29 tends to @xmath30 , the lengths of some of the arcs tend to @xmath30 . then the gluing that we obtain in the limit is still a gluing of the same circles embedded into a surface of genus @xmath22 with @xmath31 faces , but the cyclic order of the circles at the vertices is not necessarily the same as the increasing order of the colors . if the cyclic order of the circles at each vertex happens to coincide with the increasing order of colors , then what we have obtained is a true circle constellation .",
    "it is the limit of the above family and lies in the nonsmooth part of the space of gluings .",
    "if , on the contrary , the cyclic order of circles at at least one vertex differs from the increasing order of colors , then the above family has no limit .",
    "this accounts for the noncompactness of the space of gluings .",
    "now we can introduce the volume measure .",
    "consider the lengths of arcs @xmath32 , @xmath33 that form a set of local coordinates on the smooth part of the space of gluings .",
    "consider the differential form @xmath34 .",
    "if we change the numbering of the arcs , this differential form will either change its sign or remain unchanged .",
    "thus its absolute value is a well - defined volume measure on the space of gluings .",
    "we let the measure of the nonsmooth part be equal to  0 .",
    "if we now consider the space of circle constellations whose vertices are not numbered , it is obtained from the above space of circle constellations with numbered vertices by factoring by a finite group action ( the renumbering of the vertices ) . therefore it is also a smooth manifold with singularities .",
    "the volume measure being indepenent of the numbering of the vertices , it descends to the factor space .    in the sequel",
    "we will also consider spaces of circle constellations with a fixed number of marked points on the circles .",
    "an obvious modification of the above construction shows that these spaces are also smooth manifolds with singularities and that they are endowed with a natural volume form . to see that , it suffices to cut every circle into arcs not only at the points where it is glued to other circles , but also at the marked points .",
    "now we are going to compare the number of constellations composed of a given set of polygons and the volume of the space of circle constellations composed of a given set of circles .",
    "suppose we are given a set of polygons colored in @xmath6 colors and a set of circles colored in @xmath6 colors .",
    "for each color , there is the same number of polygons as of circles .",
    "denote by @xmath35 be the number of sides of the @xmath36th polygon of color @xmath16 and by @xmath37 the length of the @xmath36th circle of color @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that polygons of the same color and number of sides are labeled , so that all the polygons are distinguishable .",
    "similarly , the circles of the same color and lengths are labeled , so that all the circles are distinguishable .",
    "consider all constellations and circle constellations of genus @xmath22 with @xmath23 faces .",
    "denote by @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath39 ) the number of constellations ( respectively the volume of the space of circle constellations ) like that composed of the above set of polygons ( circles ) .",
    "finally , let @xmath21 be the total number of polygons ( circles ) and @xmath40 .",
    "[ asymptotic ] @xmath41 is a polynomial in the variables @xmath35 of degree @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath42 is a homogeneous polynomial in the variables @xmath37 of degree @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 is obtained by taking the top degree homogeneous part of @xmath41 and substituting @xmath37 for @xmath35 . in particular ,",
    "if we substitutes @xmath35 for @xmath43 in @xmath39 , we obtain an asymptotic of the numbers @xmath38 for large @xmath35 .",
    "[ [ proof.-1 ] ] proof .",
    "+ + + + + +    suppose a constellation is given .",
    "we call the _ topological type _ of the constellation the following information . first ,",
    "for each polygon we retain the number of vertices at which it is glued to some other polygons .",
    "second , enumerating these vertices in the cyclic order in which they appear on the polygon , we list , for each vertex , the polygons that are glued to it .",
    "the information that we do not retain is the number of edges that lie between the listed vertices .",
    "it is easy to see that the number of constellations of a given topological type is a polynomial in the @xmath35 . indeed , suppose that the @xmath36th polygon of color @xmath16 is glued to other polygons at @xmath44 vertices .",
    "then there are @xmath45 ways to choose these vertices on the polygon .",
    "the total number of constellations of a given topological type is equal to the product of the above numbers over all the polygons ( because the choices of the vertices are independant for different polygons ) .",
    "the top degree terms are obtained from the topological types in which no 3 polygons share a common vertex .",
    "a topological type of a circle constellation is defined in exactly the same way as for constellations : for each circle we list the points at which it is glued to other circles and the circles that are glued at each of these points ; the lengths of arcs between these points are not retained .",
    "if in a topological type at least 3 circles share a common point at least once , than such a type determines a sub - manifold of the space of gluings of positive codimension . therefore its contribution to the total volume is 0 .",
    "if , on the other hand , no 3 circles share a common point , the topological type determines a component of the space of gluings with nonzero volume . as",
    "above , denote by @xmath44 the number of points on the @xmath36th circle of color @xmath16 at which it is glued to other circles .",
    "the volume of the space of choices of these points equals @xmath46 the volume of the whole component determined by the topological type is the product of these numbers over all circles .",
    "since taking the top degree term of @xmath45 and replacing @xmath35 by @xmath37 gives us precisely @xmath47 the theorem follows .",

    "then we have @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( see examples  [ ex:3circles ] and  [ ex:3polyg ] ) .    [ 1circ ] the volume of the space of circle cacti glued from @xmath6 circles of pairwise distinct colors and with lengths @xmath57 is equal to @xmath58    [ ex:3circles ] let @xmath59 .",
    "then the three circles are necessarily glued together in a chain .",
    "suppose the circle number 1 is in the middle ( fig .",
    "[ 3circles ] ) .",
    "then the length @xmath60 of the arc between the points at which it is glued to the circles 2 and 3 can vary from @xmath30 to @xmath52 .",
    "thus the component of the space of gluings that corresponds to the first circle being in the middle has volume @xmath52 . similarly , there are two more components with volumes @xmath53 and @xmath54",

    "the space of possible markings will thus have the same volume as the space of circle cacti , and this volume is equal to @xmath58    we start by making a list of the lengths @xmath64 .",

    "this merging is shown in figure  [ circlemerge ] .",

    "this cutting is not well defined when more than two circles meet at the point @xmath66 , but the subspace of such circle cacti has zero volume , so it does not matter for us .",
    "we then take the part containing the @xmath16th circle and `` open '' it at the point @xmath66 ( so that the @xmath16th circle is transformed into an oriented arc )",

    "then the arcs are closed to form two circles , and , finally , one of them is moved to the marked point labeled by @xmath16 .",
    "performing this merging procedure for all @xmath16 from @xmath67 to @xmath6 we end up with a single circle of length @xmath63 with @xmath62 points marked by numbers from @xmath67 to @xmath6 . from this",

    "finally , the volume of the space of markings of any circle cactus with only one circle of each color ( and with given lengths of the circles ) equals @xmath74 because the @xmath75 marked points of color @xmath16 lie on the circles of colors different from @xmath16 , whose total length is @xmath76 .",
    "thus the total volume of the space of circle cacti whose circles of the same color and length are labeled , is equal to the product of the volume @xmath77 ( given by theorem  [ 1circ ] ) and of the above volume of the space of markings . in order to obtain the volume of the space of circle cacti with circles without labeling ,",

    "if we put the poles at @xmath19 and @xmath30 respectively , the function will take the form @xmath101 ( by a change @xmath102 the leading coefficient can be chosen to be equal to  @xmath17 ) . counting the number of rational functions in this case is equivalent to finding the multiplicity of the lyashko - looijenga map on the strata of the @xmath103 singularity ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we will study only the case where each critical value has only one critical point ( and several non - critical points ) as its preimage .",
    "this corresponds to constellations with polygons of distinct colors .",
    "first , let us see what kind of constellations correspond to the rational functions of the above form .",
    "a _ @xmath104-constellation _ is a constellation with @xmath105 vertices satisfying the following conditions .",

    "the exterior of the polygons of the constellation on the sphere consists of two cycles . in one of these cycles ,",
    "called the _ small cycle _ , the colors of all the edges are distinct and their cyclic order is the inverse of the cyclic order of the colors .",

    "the interior of the small cycle on the sphere contains the simple pole of the function .",
    "[ 3polyg ] suppose a set of @xmath6 polygons of distinct colors is given .",
    "the number of @xmath104-constellations glued from these polygons is equal to @xmath108    [ [ proof.-5 ] ] proof .",
    "+ + + + + +    first let us prove that the number of @xmath104-constellations of the above form is equal to @xmath109 here the second sum is taken over all choices of @xmath110 polygons among @xmath6 , and @xmath21 is the total number of vertices in these polygons .    indeed , the number @xmath23 is the number of polygons that form the small cycle .",
    "the number @xmath111 is the number of polygons that do not belong to the small cycle , but have a vertex lying on it .",
    "we are going to construct a @xmath104-constellation together with its embedding into the sphere .",
    "first we choose the numbers @xmath23 and @xmath111 , then @xmath110 polygons among the @xmath6 .",
    "then we choose the @xmath23 polygons that will form the short cycle , which explains the factor @xmath112 .",
    "there is a unique way to arrange these @xmath23 polygons into a cycle respecting the inverse cyclic order of colors .",
    "now we must glue each of the @xmath111 polygons to a vertex of the small cycle respecting the cyclic order of colors at each vertex .",
    "since each of the @xmath111 polygons must remain in the exterior part of the short cycle , there is exactly one vertex of the short cycle where it can not be glued .",
    "once we have chosen the vertices to which the @xmath111 polygons will be glued , their cyclic order is automatically determined .",
    "thus there are @xmath113 ways to glue the @xmath111 polygons .",
    "the obtained graph has @xmath23 vertices lying on the small cycle and @xmath114 `` exterior '' vertices .",
    "if , in the total @xmath104-constellation , we replace this subgraph by a unique polygon with @xmath114 vertices , we will obtain a cactus .",
    "conversely , starting with a cactus containing a @xmath115-gon , we can replace this @xmath115-gon with the graph that we have constructed above and obtain a @xmath104-constellation .",
    "therefore we just need to multiply the number of the above graphs by the number of cacti given by theorem  [ 1polyg ] : @xmath116 this immediately gives the formula @xmath117    now note that the only factor in this formula that depends on the choice of the @xmath110 polygons ( and not only on the numbers @xmath23 and @xmath111 ) is the factor @xmath114 .",
