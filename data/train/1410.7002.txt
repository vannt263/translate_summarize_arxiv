    ", more than 150 years old photoconduction remains to be very useful method for both material characterization and study of underlying physics .",
    "application of this method to investigation of the quasi - one dimensional ( q-1d ) conductors with the charge density wave ( cdw ) provide a unique information on various aspects of very reach physics of the peierls conductors ( see @xcite as a recent review ) .",
    "here we present a brief overview of the modern state of research in this area .",
    "the traditional definition of photoconduction as a phenomenon in which a material becomes more conductive due to absorption of electromagnetic radiation does not work in the case of q-1d conductors with the cdw where light absorption under certain conductions ( temperature and voltage range ) may make the material less conductive .",
    "so we will consider photoconduction as a phenomenon in which a material changes its conduction in any direction due to light absorption at a _ constant _ temperature .",
    "the latter condition is essential to distinguish photoconduction and the bolometric effect where conductance changes are caused by temperature variation caused by light absorption",
    ".    the underlying physical mechanisms of photoconduction are related to light - induced electronic transitions .",
    "only those transitions contribute into conductance , which change the current carrier concentration or mobility . in this respect photoconduction study and dielectric",
    "spectroscopy or bolometric response study provide different information , because the latter are also sensitive to electronic transitions which do not change conductance .",
    "we will use here the following notation : @xmath2 is a sample conductance , @xmath3 is photoconductance , i.e. the conductance variation due to illumination , @xmath4 is a light intensity at the sample position , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the electric current , voltage , sample resistance and length , @xmath9 is the electric field , applied to the sample , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the optical and transport energy gaps , @xmath12 is the gauss fluctuation dispersion .",
    "the spectral data discussed below are normalized to the flow of incident photons i.e. to the ratio @xmath13 .",
    "photoconduction study needs a light source optically coupled to a sample . in its simplest realization ,",
    "a led capable to operate at low - temperatures can be placed in the close vicinity of the sample .",
    "special precautions should be undertaken to minimize the heating and capacitive coupling of the led with the sample .",
    "temperature dependence of the led spectrum should also be taken into account in some special cases . as the led - emitted light power is controlled by the current flowing through the led",
    ", the light intensity control is also simple .",
    "this method was widely used for investigation of the temperature and time evolution of the photoconduction current in q-1d conductors @xcite .",
    "spectral study is a little bit more complex .",
    "ogawa with coauthors @xcite used short laser pulses ( 200 fs ) generated by opg - opa ( optical parametric generator and optical parametric amplifier ) to study the electro - optical response of k@xmath0moo@xmath1 . in our experiments",
    "we used the grid monochromator iks31 with a globar or quartz lamp ( the choice depends on the spectral region ) as a light source , the light was modulated mechanically and the photoconductance signal was measured by a lock - in amplifier @xcite . note that nonlinearity of photoconduction response",
    ", @xmath14 , intrinsic to all peierls conductors studied up to now complicates usage of advantages of fourier spectroscopy .",
    "to our knowlege photoconduction was studied in four inorganic q-1d materials : the blue bronze k@xmath0moo@xmath1 and transition metal trichalcogenides : monoclinic and orthorhombic tas@xmath1 , and also in nbs@xmath1 ( phase i ) .",
    "the first three materials are typical peierls conductors with the peierls transition temperatures @xmath15  k for the blue bronze , 220  k for o - tas@xmath1 , and 240  k and 160  k for m - tas@xmath1 .",
    "nbs@xmath1 ( phase i ) is considered as an anisotropic semiconductor with 1  ev optical gap value @xcite .",
    "[ fig : monobolo ] demonstrates the difference between the bolometric and photoconduction responses in cdw conductors .",
    "it shows a typical set of temperature dependences of the photoconductance together with the temperature dependence of the ohmic conductance , @xmath16 , and its derivative , @xmath17 , of a thick _ m-_tas@xmath1 sample .",
    "bolometric response , being proportional to the illumination - induced temperature increase ( @xmath18  mk in this particular case ) , follows @xmath19 dependence , whereas the photoconductance depends on the temperature in a very different way .",
    "it is clear from this figure , that a good thermal contact is critical for photoconduction study .",
    "we also found , that the bolometric response is practically undetectable in much thinner samples .",
    "note that @xmath17 drops dramatically in the low - temperature region , whereas photoconductance remains almost constant . as a consequence",
    ", it is very difficult to study bolometric response of peierls conductors at helium temperatures .",
    "it seems therefore that the first photoconduction spectrum of q-1d conductor was actually obtained by herr , minton and brill in 1986 in their low - temperature bolometric study @xcite .",

    "temperature dependence of photoconduction measured at fixed illumination intensity depends mostly on the temperature dependence of the relaxation time of the nonequilibrium current carriers , @xmath25 . in its turn",
    ", the relaxation time can be obtained from direct measurements of temporary response of photocurrent after switching the illumination on or off .",
    "the photoresponse kinetics was measured in blue bronzes by using the laser excitation @xcite and in _",
    "o_-tas@xmath1 with led excitation @xcite . in both cases",
    "the millisecond time scale of the characteristic time , @xmath25 , was observed .",

    "@xmath25 depends on the light intensity in a way which corresponds to the collisional recombination mechanism @xcite , intensity - dependent relaxation times are observed in the low - temperature region at @xmath27 @xcite 4 .",
    "long - time logarithmic - type relaxation appears in the low - temperature region at @xmath27 @xcite    relatively long relaxation time observed in photoconduction measurements allows to consider the current carriers ( electrons and holes ) as well - defined physical objects justifying thereby the usage of the semiconductor model @xcite for description of many properties of the peielrs conductors .",
    "note , however , that the initial and final energy states of optically excited electrons and holes may be different due to intrinsically high polarizability of crystal lattices of studied q-1d materials @xcite .",
    "there is very interesting effect of illumination on the cdw kinetics .",
    "this effect was observed in the blue bronze , k@xmath0moo@xmath1 , where illumination - induced growth of the threshold field was found @xcite .",
    "the effect was then reproduced and studied in details in _",
    "o_-tas@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the effect results from the illumination - induced change of the screening which affects in its turn the elastic modulus of the cdw .",

    "negative photoconduction ( @xmath30 ) is observed at @xmath31 @xcite due to illumination - induced growth of @xmath32 .",
    "surprisingly , a growth of photoconductance with the voltage applied can however be observed in some samples in the low - temperature region in the nonlinear conduction regime . in particular ,",
    "such a growth was observed in both orthorhombic ( see , e.g. fig .  4 in ref .",

    "[ fig : monovax ] , see also @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , such a complex behavior corresponds to the competition between at least two physical mechanisms working in opposite directions .",
    "the first one is a mechanism of spatial separation of electrons and holes which complicates their recombination and is related to fluctuations of the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this mechanism smoothly disappears when the cdw starts to move in the electric field .",
    "the second one requires the presence of electronic states ( impurities , defects , excitons ) which are capable to capture electrons and provide their recombination , have relatively small excitation energy and can be depleted or destroyed by the electric field @xmath33  v / cm .",

    "one of the most useful application of the photoconduction spectroscopy is determination of the optical energy gap value . in addition",
    ", a number of other features may be resolved by means of photoconduction spectroscopy .",
    "imperfect nesting of the cdw leads to a periodic ( in @xmath34-space ) modulation of both the bottom , @xmath35 , and the top , @xmath36 , of the peierls gap @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to suggest that the value of the gap , @xmath37 , is also modulated in the directions perpendicular to the chains ( see fig .",

    "[ fig:3d ] ) . in this case",
    "a small tail appears inside the optical gap due to indirect phonon - assistant transitions .",
    "an additional contribution to the tail may also be a consequence of the franck - condone principle @xcite .",
    "let us analyse now the photoconduction spectra data available up to now",
