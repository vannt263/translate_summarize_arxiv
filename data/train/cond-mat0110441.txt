    "the high - frequency ( @xmath0 ) region in vibrational spectra of amorphous systems is related to density fluctuations whose size is comparable to the typical distance between particles .",
    "whereas in ordered systems those excitations ( phonons ) persist up to momenta of about the debye momentum , the fate of excitations of microscopical size in disordered systems is still a quite puzzling issue , both from the theoretical and the experimental point of view .",
    "recent high - resolution inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) and neutron scattering techniques have made accessible to experiment this region  @xcite where the exchanged external momentum @xmath1 is comparable to @xmath2 , namely the momentum where the static structure factor has its first maximum . a related issue is the influence of the high - frequency dynamics of glasses on specific heat experiments in the @xmath3k@xmath4k range .",
    "a number of facts have emerged from the experiments :    1 .",
    "the dynamic structure factor @xmath5 has a * brillouin - like peak * for momenta up to @xmath6 .",
    "this inelastic peak is due to the interaction of the external photon ( or neutron ) with some excitation of the system .",
    "a very controversial issue is the propagating nature of those excitations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore a * secondary peak * at frequencies smaller than the brillouin one develops for larger momenta  @xcite , becoming dominant for @xmath7 .",
    "the brillouin peak width @xmath8 dependence on the momentum @xmath1 has been described by means of the following scaling law : @xmath9 the broadening must generally be ascribed to the interaction among the excitations and the disorder of the system .",
    "however the details are still unexplained , two remarkable facts indeed arising .",
    "first , there seems to be quite a general agreement about the fact that @xmath8 is not affected by changes in the temperature , ruling out the hydrodynamic explanation for the broadening .",
    "second , at small enough momenta ( e.g. light scattering ) @xmath10 is undoubtedly @xmath11 , ruling out also rayleigh scattering .",
    "3 .   beyond the well - known anomalous linear dependence on @xmath12 at the lowest temperatures of the specific heat ( reproduced by the two - level model  @xcite ) , another deviation from the debye @xmath13 law at slightly higher temperatures is found .",
    "the specific heat divided by @xmath13 shows a peak near @xmath14k  @xcite .",
    "this peak points to the existence of an excess of vibrational states at frequencies @xmath15thz , which shows as a peak in the plot of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the vibrational density of states , as obtained by raman or inelastic neutron scattering ) .",
    "since the scattering intensity at the peak scales in temperature with bose statistics , the peak has become known as the * boson peak * ( bp ) .",
    "two features of the bp should be remarked .",
    "first , the peak frequency @xmath18 is several times smaller than any natural frequency scale , like the debye frequency or the band edge .",
    "moreover , where good data for the dispersion relation @xmath19 ( determined from the position of the brillouin peak of the dynamic structure factor , which probes only longitudinal modes ) are available , it has been checked that @xmath19 , is still a linear function of the momentum @xmath1 at @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "second , although less experimental data are available , it seems to be the rule that @xmath18 shifts to lower frequencies on heating  @xcite ( except for silica  @xcite ) . yet , in silica the bp evolution upon increasing the density has been studied experimentally @xcite and in simulations @xcite . in close agreement with our most recent theoretical results",
    "@xcite , it was found that @xmath18 shifts to larger frequencies and the bp loses intensity when the density grows .",
    "the bp has also been identified with the secondary peak in the dynamic structure factor at high exchanged momentum , both experimentally @xcite and in simulations @xcite .",
    "a number of basic insights on the spectral properties of glasses have been obtained by means of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite on systems such as argon , silica and water . among others ,",
    "let us point out the fact that , in the glass phase , the high frequency dynamics can be understood in the framework of the _ harmonic approximation _ ( see however the work on soft - potentials  @xcite for a dissenting view ) .",
    "we still lack an universally agreed upon theoretical interpretation of the propagation of _ phonons _ in topologically disordered systems .",
    "the bp has been variously interpreted as arising from mixing of longitudinal and transverse modes @xcite , hybridization of optical and acoustic modes @xcite , a combination of level repulsion from disorder and van hove singularities @xcite , an associated mechanical instability @xcite , the presence of a ioffe - regel crossover at @xmath18 @xcite , or from the scattering of sound - waves with localized anharmonic vibrations@xcite .    here",
    "we would like to describe a theoretical approach relying on the study of the statistical properties of euclidean random matrices  @xcite ( erm ) providing a coherent framework which explains the broadening of the brillouin peak and the origin both of the boson and of the secondary peak .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "[ real ] defines our model and gives technical some details on the perturbative solution and resummation .",
    "next , sections  [ brill ] and  [ boson ] discuss the more general theoretical results , while in sec .",
    "[ nearly - gaussian ] a special interparticle potential is studied , comparing theoretical and simulation results .",
    "[ conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we are considering the spectral properties of a system whose particles oscillate around disordered positions . for the sake of simplicity we shall consider only the case the _ scalar _ case , where all the displacements are collinear . in such a system",
    "the spring constants are deterministic function , depending only on the distances of the particles rest positions , the hamiltonian being : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a matrix of the form : @xmath22 if we think of the glass as a disordered harmonic solid , the matrix @xmath21 is nothing but the hessian matrix of the system where the function @xmath23 is the second derivative of the pair potential .",
    "hence the disorder in the interactions is due to topological reasons , namely the disordered position of particles . as in those topologically disordered systems one can not split the interactions ( spring constants ) in an ordered part plus a disorder - dependent correction , a new theoretical framework involving the so - called euclidean random matrices had to be introduced  @xcite .",
    "the quantity to be directly compared with scattering experiments is the dynamic structure factor @xmath5 , which at one - excitation level can be computed by means of  @xcite : @xmath24 having introduced the resolvent : @xmath25 [ ( z - m)^{-1}]_{jk } } \\label{gdipi}\\ ] ]    the overline has the meaning of average over the disordered equilibrium positions . as a matter of fact",
    ", we are assuming that the vibrational spectra of amorphous systems are _ self - averaging _ quantity , hence they should not depend on the given configuration of disorder .",
    "a straightforward method to compute the resolvent is to write it as the sum of a geometric series , whose @xmath26th element is : @xmath27 letting @xmath28 be the fourier transform of @xmath23 , without any loss of generality the resolvent can be written : @xmath29\\ , \\label{lambdadip}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the self - energy @xmath30 describes the interactions between the phonons and the disorder .",
    "the simplest case arises when all the particles are randomly placed without any correlation . in that situation , using @xmath31=\\left(1/v\\right)^n$ ] as the probability distribution of quenched variables , it is possible to build a perturbative approach where the leading term is exact when the density @xmath32 in infinite and the next - to leading terms are proportional to powers of @xmath33  @xcite . furthermore by means of well - known resummation techniques , the @xmath33 correction has been exploited in order to obtain an integral equation for the self - energy  @xcite : @xmath34 ^ 2 } { z-\\epsilon(q)-\\sigma(q , z)}\\ , .",
    "\\label{cactus}\\ ] ] whose solution takes into account a given class of terms of any order .",
    "however , the quenched position in glasses ( and amorphous systems in general ) are highly correlated .",
    "let us sketch a simple approximation dealing with the correlated case .",
    "let @xmath35 be the @xmath26-points correlation function related to an arbitrary probability distribution @xmath31 $ ] : @xmath36 hence , the average on the position of the particles is : @xmath37    although the computation using the full correlation function would be exceedingly difficult , some progress can be made by using the so called superposition approximation : @xmath38 where the pair correlation function is used to take into account the correlation of the position of the particles . the superposition approximation can be embedded in our calculation if we make the substitution  @xcite : @xmath39 this is rather important , because , for typical applications , the function @xmath40 , being badly divergent at short distances , does not have a fourier transform . on the other hand , the function @xmath41 typically tends to zero at the origin exponentially , thus taking care of the algebraic divergence of @xmath23 .",
    "let us point out that in the one - excitation approximation the following relationship between the dos and the dynamic structure factor holds  @xcite : @xmath42 as at very high frequencies the one - excitation approximation does not hold , and many - excitations contributions should be taken into account , the reliability of eq .",
    "( [ infinito ] ) in describing real systems is a very interesting matter .",
    "the following connections between the main features of the dynamical structure factor and the self - energy are established :    * the bare dispersion relation @xmath43 , which would give the position of the peak in the elastic medium limit , is renormalized by the real part of the self - energy @xmath44 .",
    "this gives @xmath45 , the position of the maximum of the structure factor in the frequency domain .",
    "let us note that @xmath45 is certainly linear for small @xmath1 , as expected .",
    "* the imaginary part @xmath46 computed at the position of the peak @xmath47 gives the width , @xmath48 , of the @xmath49 by means of : @xmath50    here we want to show that eq .",
    "( [ cactus ] ) provides a model - independent derivation of the exponent @xmath10 in the scaling law  ( [ broad ] ) .",
    "indeed , the large @xmath51 contribution to the imaginary part of the integral in equation ( [ cactus ] ) is , because of ( [ infinito ] ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the density of states in the domain of eigenvalues ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "if the spectrum is debye - like we have @xmath55 , and it is straightforward to show that  ( [ sigmazero ] ) is proportional to @xmath56 . then the relation  ( [ gamma ] ) implies the scaling : @xmath57 irrespective of the function @xmath23 .",
    "clearly this is only the large @xmath51 contribution to the integral , but it has been shown that it indeed controls the peak width at small @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "hence the erm theory yields the correct asymptotic behavior at very low momenta of the broadening of the peak .",
    "exploiting the relation  ( [ infinito ] ) , it is possible to obtain from  ( [ cactus ] ) an integral equation even for the dos . as a matter of fact ,",
    "defining @xmath58 , the dos turns out to be @xmath59 @xmath60 being the solution of the following integral equation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 . with this equation",
    ", one needs to know the resolvent at all @xmath51 to obtain the dos , due to the last term in the r.h.s .",
    "this can be done by solving numerically the self - consistent equation of ref .",
    "@xcite , but here we perform an approximate analysis , which is more illuminating . the crudest approximation is to neglect this term , in which case eq .",
    "[ densidaddeestados ] is quadratic in @xmath63 , and one easily finds a semicircular dos , with center at @xmath64 and radius @xmath65 .",
    "this spectrum is the glass analogue of a van - hove singularity : indeed , when @xmath66 , the spectrum is made of plane waves , with dispersion relation @xmath67 ,  @xcite ( a continuous elastic medium ) .",
    "@xmath19 saturates for large @xmath1 at @xmath68 , yielding an enormous pile - up of states which causes the dos to be concentrated at this value  @xcite . at finite @xmath32",
    ", density fluctuations of the @xmath69 are present which act as a perturbation that splits this degeneracy , and yields the semicircular part of the spectrum at high frequency .",
    "but the semicircular spectrum misses the debye part , and a better approximation is needed .",
    "so we substitute @xmath70 in the last term of the r.h.s . by the resolvent of the continuum elastic medium @xmath71 .",
    "this is reasonable because the @xmath72 factor makes low momenta dominate the integral , and due to translational invariance @xmath73 in this region  @xcite .",
    "we shall be looking at small @xmath74 , so to a good approximation @xmath75 where the sound velocity is @xmath76 and @xmath77 . then",

    "\\label{smallomega}\\ ] ] we have two limiting cases . at high densities and low frequencies ( @xmath80 ) ,",
    "i.e.  when the semicircular part of the dos does not reach low frequencies , the square root can be taylor - expanded , and one gets @xmath81 which is precisely debye s law . at small densities , on the other hand ,",
    "the center of the semicircle ( which is at @xmath82 ) starts to be comparable to its radius ( @xmath83 ) , meaning that the states in the semicircle hybridize with the sound waves .",
    "mathematically , the instability arises when @xmath84 develops an imaginary part .",
    "this can only come from the square root in eq .",
    "( [ smallomega ] ) , and it will happen for @xmath85 , with @xmath86 fixed by the condition @xmath87 now when @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the square root in eq .",
    "( [ smallomega ] ) behaves as @xmath90 with @xmath91 a positive constant .",
    "here we can distinguish two regimes :    * when @xmath92 , the imaginary part of @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath93 , and thus the dos is @xmath94 .",
    "* when @xmath95 , we have an imaginary part @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "so the dos is debye - like , but with a very large prefactor , basically unrelated to the speed of sound .",
    "it is therefore natural to identify @xmath18 with @xmath98 , that can indeed be arbitrarily small upon approaching the instability .",
    "notice that the mechanical instability is a kind of phase transition , for which the order parameter is @xmath99 . from eq .",
    "( [ orden ] ) we see that this order parameter behaves as @xmath100 , with @xmath101 , like in mean - field theories .",
    "since the behavior of the propagator at high momentum does not strongly affect the dispersion relation  @xcite , we do not expect deviations from a linear dispersion relation at @xmath18 .",
    "this has been checked either numerically or solving numerically the self - consistency equation given a particular choice for the function @xmath23 ( see the numerical results section below ) .",

    "when @xmath110 ( gaussian case ) , the hessian is strictly positive .",
    "when @xmath111 , we have a stable elastic solid at high densities , while at low enough densities , typical interparticle distances will be large enough to allow negative eigenvalues ( imaginary frequencies )",
    ". therefore the density @xmath32 controls the appearance of a mechanical instability in this model .",
    "the counterpart in real glasses of that instability is expected to be the mode - coupling transition . as a matter of fact , that dynamical transition marks a change of the local topological properties of the potential energy landscape  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", there is a transition from a region where the short time dynamics is ruled by a positive hessian ( high density ) to one where an extensive number of negative eigenvalues is found ( low density ) .",
    "the choice  ( [ famiglia ] ) may seem an oversimplification , too distant from any realistic case . however , this is not actually so , at least for small momenta .",

    "there is a mechanical instability transition controlled by the density , as signalled by the presence of imaginary frequencies .",
    "the vibrational density of states of our models contains a bp which is the precursor of the instability transition .",
    "the bp in our model shares the main features of the experimental bp : it appears for frequencies in the linear part of the dispersion relation and it shifts towards arbitrarily low frequencies on approaching a mechanical instability .",
    "we also reproduce qualitatively the behavior of the silica bp when the density changes  @xcite ( the detailed theory of the temperature evolution of the silica bp should consider its negative thermal dilatation coefficient ) .",
    "the bp is built from the hybridization of sound waves with high frequency modes ( extended but non propagating ) that get softer upon approaching the instability .",
    "the analogous of our instability transition in nature is the topological phase transition  @xcite that underlies the dynamic crossover at the mode coupling temperature of real glasses  @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of the high - frequency modes that hybridize with the sound - waves is most likely material dependent and non - universal : they could be transverse  @xcite , optical  @xcite , or even longitudinal modes as in our model .",
    "we believe however that the basic mechanism for the formation of the bp uncovered in our model is common to most ( if not all ) structural glasses . yet",
