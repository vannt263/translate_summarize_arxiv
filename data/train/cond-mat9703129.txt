    "the problem of the crossover from a bcs - like superconducting state to a bose condensate of local pairs @xcite has gained new interest in the context of high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "while there is still no microscopic theory of how superconductivity arises from doping the antiferromagnetic and insulating parent compounds @xcite , it is clear that the superconducting state can be described in terms of a generalized pairing picture .",
    "the many body ground state is thus a coherent superposition of two particle states built from spin singlets in a relative d - wave configuration @xcite .",
    "the short coherence length @xmath6 parallel to the basic @xmath7-planes which is of the same order than the average interparticle spacing @xmath8 , however indicates that neither the bcs picture of highly overlapping pairs nor a description in terms of composite bosons is applicable here .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to develop a theory , which is able to cover the whole regime between weak and strong coupling in a unified manner . on a phenomenological level",
    "such a description is provided by the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory .",
    "indeed , it is a nonvanishing expectation value of the complex order parameter @xmath9 which signals the breaking of gauge invariance as the basic characteristic of the superconducting state , irrespective of whether the pair size is much larger or smaller than the interparticle spacing . a gl description of the bcs to bose crossover was developed for the s - wave case by drechsler and one of the present authors @xcite in two dimensions and by s de melo , randeria and engelbrecht @xcite for the three - dimensional case .",
    "in our present work the theory for the two - dimensional case is reconsidered , including a discussion of the nelson - kosterlitz jump of the order parameter and the generalization to the experimentally relevant situation of d - wave superconductivity .",
    "moreover we also calculate the characteristic lengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 and compare our results with measured properties of high-@xmath1 compounds .",
    "the remarkable success with which the standard bcs model has been applied to conventional superconductors relies on the fact that in the weak coupling limit the details of the attractive interaction are irrelevant . by an appropriate rescaling of the parameters the properties of all weak coupling superconductors are therefore universal .",
    "it is one of our aims here to investigate to which extent such a simplifying description also exists in more strongly coupled superconductors . starting from a microscopic model with an instantaneous attractive interaction , we find that the resulting gl functional takes the standard form for arbitrary strength of the coupling . by adjusting a single dimensionless parameter to the measured upper critical field near @xmath1",
    ", we obtain consistent values for both the dimensionless ratio @xmath10 between the coherence length and interparticle spacing as well as the observed value @xmath11 of the gl parameter in optimally doped high-@xmath1 compounds .",
    "therefore , in spite of the rather crude nature of the original microscopic model , our gl theory is quantitatively applicable to strongly coupled superconductors which are far from the standard weak coupling limit , although not yet in the crossover regime to bose - like behaviour .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we introduce our microscopic model which has an attractive interaction in the singlet d - wave channel . from this",
    "we derive , via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , a statistical gl theory which is valid near @xmath1 .",
    "the relevant coefficients of the gl functional are calculated for arbitrary interaction strength . in section iii",
    "we discuss the appropriate microscopic definition of the order parameter and the evolution from the bcs to the bose limit of the well known kosterlitz - thouless jump in the superfluid density of two - dimensional superconductors . ignoring the subtleties of the kosterlitz - thouless transition , in section",
    "iv we use a gaussian approximation to determine the critical temperature and the associated value of the chemical potential at the transition . finally in section",
    "v we determine the characteristic lengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 near the transition for arbitrary strength of the coupling . adjusting the coupling to the experimental values of the slope of @xmath12 near @xmath1 ,",
    "we then determine the associated dimensionless ratios @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "they agree rather well with the observed values in ybco and bscco . a brief conclusion and a discussion of open problems",
    "is given in section vi .",
    "as a general model describing fermions with an instaneous pairwise interaction @xmath15 in a translationally invariant system , we start from the hamiltonian ( @xmath16 is the volume of the system . )",
    "@xmath17 with an arbitrary single particle energy @xmath18 which we will later replace by an effective mass approximation @xmath19 . in the two - dimensional case , which we consider throughout , the fourier transform @xmath20 of the interaction potential may be expanded in its relative angular momentum contributions @xmath21 by @xmath22 with @xmath23 the angle between @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the following we are only interested in d - wave pairs with symmetry @xmath26 .",
    "we therefore omit all contributions @xmath27 and also neglect the dependence on the absolute values @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the momenta . assuming the interaction is separable , we thus approximate @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 a negative constant characterizing the strength of the attractive interaction .",
    "finally the restriction to singlet pairing is incorporated trivially by considering only interactions between fermions with opposite spins @xmath33 . in this manner",
    "we obtain a gorkov - like reduced interaction hamiltonian @xmath34 ( note that the shift by @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ ref3 ] ) is necesssary to guarantee that the interaction is symmetric with respect to @xmath36 . ) . for the derivation of a gl functional below , it is convenient to introduce pair operators @xmath37 via @xmath38 the contribution @xmath39 may then be written in the form @xmath40 of an attractive interaction between pairs of fermions with opposite spin and total momentum @xmath41 . in the following we want to derive a functional integral representation of the grand partition function @xmath42 which gives the standard gl theory as its mean field limit . since we are interested in a superconducting state with a nonzero anomalous average @xmath43 , it is convenient to formally linearize the interaction term @xmath39 by a hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite .",
    "the grand partition function is thus expressed in terms of a functional integral @xmath44 . here",

    "to lowest order in the spatial and temporal gradients of the order parameter , it is sufficient to keep only the leading terms in @xmath71 and replace @xmath72 by its constant value at zero momentum and frequency .",
    "this expansion is valid , provided the contributions of order @xmath73 and @xmath74 in eq .",

    "the standard bcs coherence length @xmath78 which , for the clean limit considered here , is identical with the gl coherence length @xmath79 as defined in ( [ ref49 ] ) .",
    "the standard form of the gl functional with a gradient term @xmath80 is therefore valid provided the order parameter varies on scales larger than @xmath81 . with increasing strength of the coupling @xmath76 , the pair radius @xmath77 decreases and thus the validity of the expansion ( 17 ) extends to variations on shorter length scales .",

    "similar to the spatial dependence , however , the necessary scale for the @xmath57-dependence of the order parameter for which the leading terms kept in ( 17 ) are sufficient , decreases with increasing coupling .",
    "thus , in the bose limit , the description of the time dependence of the order parameter by a first order derivative like in the well known gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite becomes exact ( see also section vi ) .    with these approximations our gl functional in @xmath85)\\ ]",

    "this divergence is usually eliminated by argueing that the interaction is finite only in a thin shell around the fermi surface . in the present case",
    "however , where the condensation in the strong coupling limit really affects the whole fermi sphere , such a procedure is no longer possible . instead ,",
    "as was pointed out by randeria et al.@xcite , we have to connect the bare coupling constant to the low energy limit of the two - body scattering problem . in two dimensions",

    "the existence of a bound state is indeed a necessary condition for superconductivity even in the case of d - wave pairing , although quite generally it only applies in the s - wave case @xcite . since in the effective mass approximation",

    "this is a reflection of the fact that the product of two field operators at the same point can properly defined only with a cutoff . ) .",
    "since @xmath77 is the radius of a pair , the relation ( [ ordpar ] ) shows that @xmath154 is just the areal density of pairs .",
    "this remains true even in the bose limit where @xmath155 while the product @xmath156 eventually behaves like a true bose field operator @xmath157 .",

    "it is given by an expression like ( [ ordpar ] ) but with the interparticle spacing @xmath8 instead of @xmath77 as the prefactor .",
    "thus @xmath161 is essentially the probability density for two fermions with opposite spin at the same point . in the bcs limit",
    "this density is exponentially small due to the large size of a pair .",
    "the superfluid density in turn is still of order one even in weak coupling and indeed at zero temperature @xmath147 must be equal to the full density @xmath59 for any superfluid ground state in a translational system as considered here @xcite .",
    "using @xmath162 , the relation ( [ ref32 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of a jump @xmath163 of the renormalized superfluid density .",
    "the superfluid fraction @xmath164 therefore has a jump of order @xmath165 .",
    "since this ratio approaches zero in weak coupling , there is a smooth crossover between the universal jump of the superfluid density in a bose superfluid @xcite and the behaviour in a strict bcs model where @xmath166 vanishes _ continuously _ near @xmath1 even in two dimensions .",
    "indeed the bcs - hamiltonian is equivalent to a model with an infinite range interaction of strength @xmath167 for which mean field theory is exact @xcite . in the following",

    "( [ ref34b ] ) precisely because our coefficient @xmath181 has been expanded only to linear order in @xmath70 .",

    "the transition temperature becomes independent of the original attractive interaction and is completely determined by the boson density @xmath202 and the effective mass @xmath208 .",
    "it approaches a value of about @xmath209 of the fermi energy , which is likely to be an upper limit for @xmath1 in the present problem .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath129 at the transition decreases monotonically from its weak coupling value @xmath204 to @xmath132 in the bose limit .",
    "it changes sign at @xmath210 , where the behaviour crosses over from bcs- to bose - like ( in fig [ fig3 ] we have supressed a small dip in @xmath129 around these couplings which is an artefact of the pronounced maximum in @xmath1 ) .",
    "apart from the chemical potential @xmath129 , the nature of the transition can also be inferred from evaluating the number of preformed bosons at @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity , which is just half of the contribution ( [ ref43 ] ) to the number equation is shown in fig .",
    "it is obvious that the nature of the phase transition changes rather quickly in a range of couplings between @xmath211 and @xmath212 . for smaller couplings ,",
    "the density of preformed pairs near @xmath1 is essentially negligible and binding occurs simultaneously with condensation . on the other hand , for @xmath213 basically all pairs are already present above @xmath1 and the transition to superconductivity is that of a true bose system .",
    "in the following we want to determine both the coherence length @xmath2 and the penetration depth @xmath3 as a function of the coupling .",
    "the former is defined both above and below @xmath1 and may be obtained from the gl coefficients simply via @xmath214 the definition of a penetration depth in a two - dimensional superconductor has been discussed in section iii . within the gaussian approximation we may replace @xmath140 in ( 31 ) by @xmath215 which leads to @xmath216 here",
    "we have introduced the bare value @xmath217 of the london penetration depth defined by @xmath218 with @xmath219 the nominal three - dimensional carrier density .",
    "note that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been written in terms of the original static gl - coefficients @xmath220 and @xmath101 , in order to stress that the characteristic lengths are independent of the normalization of @xmath9 , i.e. the kinetic coefficient @xmath102 does not enter here .",
    "since the coefficient @xmath87 vanishes at the transition , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 diverge . now in a full treatment of the gl - functional , including the @xmath221-term , the behaviour very close to @xmath1 in a single layer would be of the kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "the correlation length would thus diverge like @xcite @xmath222 while @xmath223 would jump from zero to a finite value below @xmath1 ( see ( 32 ) ) .",
    "in the three - dimensional case , the behaviour very close to @xmath1 is that of a 3d xy - model with nontrivial but well known critical exponents @xcite . in our gaussian approximation",
    "this complex structure is replaced by a simple mean field behaviour .",
    "however there is a subtle point even at this level of approximation .",
    "indeed the coefficient @xmath87 depends both on temperature and chemical potential and it is only in the strict bcs - limit , where the latter is a fixed constant equal to @xmath204 . with increasing coupling , however , the chemical potential changes and thus the relevant limit close to @xmath1 is to consider @xmath224 as @xmath225 .",
    "now by using the exact relation ( [ ref39 ] ) , it is straightforward to show @xcite that @xmath226 vanishes quadratically near @xmath1 . the resulting critical exponent for the correlation length would thus be @xmath227 .",
    "indeed this is the exponent expected for an ideal bose gas in three dimensions , to which our gaussian approximation is effectively equivalent . now in order to allow a comparison of our results with measured values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are found to obey a mean field behaviour with @xmath228 except very close to @xmath1 @xcite , we neglect the temperature dependence of the chemical potential near @xmath1 . as a result @xmath229 vanishes linearly near @xmath1 , giving the standard mean field divergence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "obviously this approximation is only reliable on the weak coupling side of the transition . as we will see below",
    ", however , this is indeed the relevant regime even in high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "we thus expect that our results are at least qualitatively reliable for these systems .",
    "for strong coupling , the derivative @xmath230 of @xmath231 near @xmath1 vanishes like @xmath232 . as a result , the characteristic lengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 would increase exponentially in the bose limit which is unphysical however .",
    "we have therefore restricted our calculation of the gl coherence length @xmath79 defined by @xmath233 to coupling strengths @xmath234 smaller than about @xmath212 , where the system starts to cross over to bose like behaviour . the corresponding result for @xmath79 in units of @xmath235",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "it exhibits the expected decrease of the coherence length from its weak coupling limit @xmath236 to values of order one near the crossover regime , before it starts to rise again . as was noted above our approximations in determining @xmath79",
    "are no longer reliable in this regime . while in three dimensions @xmath79",
    "is expected to increase like @xmath237 @xcite with @xmath238 the relevant bose - bose scattering length @xcite , the actual behaviour in two dimensions is unknown .",
    "fortunately , however , this problem does not arise in determining the gl - parameter @xmath239 which , in two dimensions , can be expressed as @xmath240 here we have introduced the equivalent of the classical electron radius @xmath241 where @xmath113 is the band mass . since the problematic coefficient @xmath87 has dropped out in @xmath242 , we can use ( [ ref52 ] ) to determine the gl - parameter in the whole regime between weak and strong coupling .",
    "in the bcs - limit @xmath242 is exponentially small , behaving like @xmath243 .",
    "the associated penetration depth @xmath244 is thus essentially equal to the london value @xmath217 .",
    "by contrast , for the bose case @xmath242 approaches a constant value @xmath245 which is large compared to one , since @xmath246 for realistic values of the sheet thickness @xmath139 .",
    "the complete dependence of @xmath242 in the crossover regime is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "it is a monotonic function of the binding energy .",
    "thus with increasing coupling there is always a transition from type i to type ii behaviour in two dimensions , even for a clean superconductor with no impurities as considered here .    with these results ,",
    "we are now in a position to compare our simple model with experimental values for optimally doped high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "since the critical temperature is exponentially sensitive to the coupling strength and also is likely to be considerably reduced compared to our result in fig . 2 by fluctuation effects in the crossover regime , we have refrained from taking @xmath1 as a reliable parameter for adjustment .",
    "instead we have used the measured values of the slope of the upper critical field @xmath0 near @xmath1 , which determines the gl coherence length @xmath79 via @xmath247 in order to fix the dimensionless coupling strength @xmath205 from the measured values @xcite @xmath248 for optimally doped ybco ( @xmath249 ) and @xcite @xmath250 for the corresponding compound bscco ( @xmath251 ) , we need the in plane carrier densities @xmath59 which determine an effective value of @xmath252 ( it should be pointed out that @xmath253 is introduced here only as a measure of the carrier density . in fact due to the strong attractive interaction , the actual momentum distribution of the fermions just above @xmath1 will be far from the standard fermi distribution , except in the bcs limit . ) .",
    "the three - dimensional carrier densities in optimally doped ybco and bscco are @xcite @xmath254 and @xcite @xmath255 respectively . with the corresponding values @xcite @xmath256 and @xmath257 of the effective sheet thickness , the resulting fermi momenta are @xmath258 for ybco and @xmath259 for bscco .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath260 and @xmath261 between the coherence length and the average interparticle spacing then allows us to determine the effective coupling strength . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we find that @xmath262 is equal to @xmath263 for ybco and @xmath264 for bscco . as figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show , these coupling strengths describe superconductors which are still on the weak coupling side of the crossover from bcs to bose behaviour .",
    "for instance the density of preformed bosons at @xmath1 is less then 1% in both cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . in order to check",
    "whether our description is consistent , we determine the associated values of the gl parameter @xmath242 near @xmath1 . from the above values of @xmath139 and the band masses @xcite @xmath265 for ybco and @xcite @xmath266 for bscco ( @xmath267 is the free - electron mass . )",
    "we find that @xmath268 is equal to @xmath269 and @xmath270 respectively for the two compounds considered here . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we thus obtain @xmath271 and @xmath272 for optimally doped ybco and bscco .",
    "these numbers agree very well with the experimentally determined values of @xmath242 , which are @xcite @xmath273 and @xcite @xmath274 .",
    "our simple one parameter model therefore gives a consistent quantitative description of the characteristic lengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the crossover in the superconducting transition between bcs- and bose - like behaviour within a gl description .",
    "it has been found that optimally doped high-@xmath1 superconductors are still on the weak coupling side of this crossover , although they are certainly far away from the bcs - limit .",
    "our microscopic model is characterized by a single dimensionless parameter , similar to the familiar bcs - hamiltonian . while the gl functional has the standard form for arbitrary coupling its coefficients depend strongly on the coupling strength .",
    "the crossover , at least in two dimensions , is essentially identical for the s- or d - wave case .",
    "for static properties , only two of the relevant coefficients @xmath87 , @xmath62 and @xmath101 are independent , since the normalization of the order parameter is arbitrary .",
    "fixing @xmath79 from experiment therefore leaves only one further parameter  for instance @xmath242  as an independent predicted quantity .",
    "the good agreement of @xmath242 with measured values supports our conclusion that the optimally high-@xmath1 compounds are intermediate between bcs and bose behaviour .",
    "since the crossover regime is rather narrow , however , weak coupling theories are still a reasonable approximation for the relevant coupling strengths .",
    "this is consistent with the empirical fact that a weak coupling approach apparently works well in many cases .",
    "evidently there are a number of important open questions .",
    "they may be divided into two classes : the first one concerns the problem of a better and more complete treatment of our model itself .",
    "the second class is related to the problem , to which extent this model is applicable to high-@xmath1 compounds and what are the necessary ingredients for a more realistic description . regarding our microscopic hamiltonian as a given model , it is obvious that our treatment of the associated gl phenomenology is still incomplete . in particular",
    "the gaussian approximation is obviously not sufficient to give a quantitatively reliable result for @xmath1 at intermediate coupling .",
    "moreover , the behaviour of the characteristic lengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the strong coupling limit is completely unknown . in order to go beyond the gaussian approximation , it is necessary to include the pair interaction ( i.  e. the @xmath169-term ) properly .",
    "progress in this direction has been made in the three - dimensional case by haussmann @xcite and very recently by pistolesi and strinati @xcite . using a self - consistent and conserving approximation for the green- and vertex functions ,",
    "haussmann obtained a smooth increase of @xmath1 with coupling , thus eliminating the unphysical maximum in the crossover regime found in the gaussian approximation .",
    "this approach is rather different from our present one and requires extensive numerical work .",
    "pistolesi and strinati have performed an essentially analytical calculation of the correlation length @xmath275 at zero temperature , using a loop expansion in a functional approach similar to our present one .",
    "they have shown that the pair radius @xmath276 coincides with @xmath275 not only in the bcs - limit , but down to values around @xmath277 .",
    "similar to our results for the gl coherence length @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , @xmath278 reaches a minimum of order one in the crossover regime before it starts to rise again . since in three dimensions the behaviour at strong coupling is that of a weakly interacting bose gas with scattering length @xmath279 @xcite , @xmath275 eventually increases like @xmath280 while @xmath281 approaches zero @xcite .",
    "unfortunately for the two - dimensional case , where the boson interaction @xmath184 is finite even at very strong coupling @xcite , the kosterlitz - thouless nature of the transition makes it very difficult to improve upon the simple approximations used here .",
    "a first step in this direction was taken by traven@xcite .",
    "he showed that interactions between the pair fluctuations guarantee a nonvanishing superfluid density at finite temperature , in agreement with our arguments below eq .",
    "( [ ref40 ] ) .",
    "however there seems to be no quantitative calculation of the coherence length in a two - dimensional bose - like regime even near zero temperature .",
    "a different problem we want to mention here is that of the proper time dependent gl theory . since our quantum gl functional",
    "is derived from a microscopic hamiltonian , in principle it contains the complete information about the order parameter dynamics , at least as far as intrinsic effects are concerned . neglecting higher order terms in the expansion in @xmath70 , the resulting equation of motion for the order parameter in real time @xmath282 is @xcite @xmath283}{\\delta\\psi^{\\star}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)}\\;.\\ ] ] due to the analytic continuation , the coefficient @xmath284 has now acquired a finite imaginary part @xmath285 which describes irreversible relaxation . for a better comparison with the standard literature ,",
    "it is convenient to choose the conventional order parameter @xmath286 , where the prefactor of the gradient term is @xmath110 . with this choice of normalization ,",
    "the kinetic coefficient @xmath287 is identical with the effective mass discussed in section iii .",
    "it is then evident from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that a gross - pitaevskii - like dynamics where @xmath288 , is only valid in the bose limit , while @xmath289 is exponentially small for weak coupling .",
    "indeed for bcs - like systems it is @xmath290 which is dominant , being of order @xmath291 in the three - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "this result reflects the fact that for weak coupling superconductors the order parameter dynamics is purely relaxing .",
    "going beyond the bcs - limit , the associated kinetic coefficient @xmath290 has only been evaluated in three dimensions @xcite , where it exhibits a maximum at intermediate coupling .",
    "its behaviour in the bose - limit and in two dimensions in general , however , is completely unknown .",
    "since the incorporation of scattering states in the three - dimensional case requires to go beyond the linear expansion in @xmath70 , it is likely however , that a simple first order equation like eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) is in fact not appropriate for describing the dynamics at intermediate coupling .",
    "it is only at very low temperatures where the situation becomes simple again . indeed from quite general arguments @xcite ,",
    "the dynamics as @xmath292 is expected to be of the gross - pitaevskii form , irrespective of the strength of the coupling .",
    "finally we mention that a proper microscopic calculation of the complex coefficient @xmath102 is relevant for understanding the hall effect in high-@xmath1 compounds @xcite .",
    "concerning the question to which extent our model is really applicable to high-@xmath1 superconductors , it is obvious that most of the complexity of these systems is neglected here .",
    "in particular we have assumed that the normal state is characterized by a given density of effective mass fermions with some instantaneous attractive interaction @xcite .",
    "such a system will certainly be very different from a conventional fermi liquid for intermediate or strong coupling .",
    "our conclusion that we are still on the weak coupling side of the crossover , with a negligible density of preformed pairs , is consistent with the phenomenology of optimally ( and perhaps overdoped ) high-@xmath1 superconductors , however it is certainly inappropriate for the underdoped cuprates .",
    "indeed these systems exhibit a gap far above @xmath1 which may be interpreted in terms of preformed bosons .",
    "a gl description of underdoped compounds was very recently developed by geshkenbein , ioffe and larkin @xcite .",
    "assuming that bosons form far above @xmath1 only in parts of the fermi surface and coexist with unpaired fermions through @xmath1 , they obtain a reasonable description of the phenomenology of certain underdoped materials .",
    "this behaviour is quite different from that obtained in our model , which completely neglects any effects of the coulomb repulsion and band structure .",
    "it is obvious that for a quantitative description of high-@xmath1 superconductors both coulomb correlations and band structure effects have to be included , which requires to use lattice models .",
    "they provide a quantitative description of these complex systems at least in the normal state and allow the calculation of microscopic properties like spectral functions , etc @xcite .",
    "unfortunately with these models it still seems impossible to really explain how d - wave superconductivity arises from the strongly spin and charge correlated normal state . as a result ,",
    "effective models like the negative - u hubbard model are often used to discuss microscopic properties of high-@xmath1 compounds @xcite .",
    "our present approach is more phenomenological , starting from a model in which all microscopic details are neglected except for the fact that we have a strong pairing interaction in a system of fermions with given density .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is that it allows a simple calculation of the relevant lengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 and quantities following from that like the critical fields .",
    "the fact that the resulting gl theory gives a consistent description of optimally doped cuprates indicates that at least at this level the microscopic details are not relevant . certainly our results supporting this view are quite limited so far and it is necessary to investigate this further .",
    "since the coefficients of the gl functional near @xmath1 are quite generally determined by the properties in the _ normal _ state , an interesting future direction would be to see whether superconducting properties below @xmath1 can quantitatively be obtained from the gl functional by properly incorporating the anomalous behaviour in the normal state .",
