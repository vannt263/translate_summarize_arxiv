    "in 1936 , alan m. turing gave an example of a well - founded ( and thus mathematically solvable ) problem which he showed to admit no computable solution .",
    "more precisely he first introduced what is now called the turing machine ( ) as an idealization ( ` _ _ model _ _ ' ) of a digital computer and revealed it capable of solving a vast variety of practical problems like , for instance , answering whether a given integer is prime .",
    "[ defproblem ] a computational _ problem _ is a subset @xmath0 .",
    "+ it is _ decided _ by @xmath1 if , upon input of any @xmath2 ,    * @xmath1 eventually outputs `` 0 '' ( _ rejects _ ) and halts  in case @xmath3 .",
    "* @xmath1 eventually outputs `` 1 '' ( _ accepts _ ) and halts  in case @xmath4    having thus indicated the fundamental power of this machine , turing then proceeded to exhibit its limitation by formally proving that the @xmath5  the question whether a given @xmath1 eventually halts or rather continues executing indefinitely  can not be decided by any @xmath6 .",
    "notice that , according to definition  [ defproblem ] , this hypothetical @xmath6 is required to always give the correct answer and to terminate . more precisely , the difficulty inherent to the halting problem consists in telling within finite time whether @xmath1 does _ not _ halt ; for , simply simulating @xmath1 step by step , @xmath6 can easily identify the case when @xmath1 _ does _ terminate .",
    "turing s result initiated the flourishing field of computability or recursion theory @xcite .",
    "its goal is to distinguish computable from uncomputable problems and to classify the latter according to their degree of uncomputability @xcite .",
    "for example , the following celebrated result of matiyasevich has settled hilbert s to the negative by proving it equivalent to @xmath5 :    [ thhilbert ] on the one hand , a given description of a diophantine equation @xmath7 ( like fermat s famous  `` @xmath8 ''   for @xmath9 ) can computably be transformed into a @xmath1 such that it holds : @xmath1 terminates iff @xmath7 admits an integral solution .    on the other hand",
    ", a given @xmath1 can computably be converted into the description of a diophantine equation @xmath7 in such a way that , again , @xmath1 halts iff @xmath7 admits an integral solution . in particular since , according to @xcite , the first can not be decided algorithmically , neither can the latter .",
    "apart from the , many further sensible notions of computability have been proposed : e.g. , @xmath10-recursion ( which gave the field its name ) , herbrand - gdel - computability ( which led to the programming language ` prolog ` ) , or @xmath11-calculus ( which stipulated ` lisp ` ) .",
    "but they were all shown equivalent to the by church , kleene , post , turing and others ; cf .",
    "e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ` chapter  i ` ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ` section  26.3 + 4 ` ) .",
    "the popular language for example is equivalent , too : internet provides many applets for simulating a ; and conversely devising a interpreter on a .",
    "is merely tedious but not difficult .",
    "even a   processor is basically just a  although a very fast one ; recall that we are dealing with problems which can not be solved computationally at all , neither quickly nor slowly . for the very same reason , ( at least ` standard ' )",
    "quantum computers are still no more powerful than an ordinary ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote  1 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that both halting and hilbert s tenth problem are desirable to be solved for very practical reasons .",
    "the first for instance arises in automatized software verification ; indeed , correctness of some source code includes its termination which , by the above considerations , can not be checked algorithmically .",
    "similarly , a hypothetical algorithm for deciding feasibility of diophantine equations could be applied to computer - proving not only fermat s last theorem but also to settle many other still open questions for example in number theory .    observing that @xcite ruled out the possibility of a _ turing machine _ to decide either of these problems , people have since long tried to devise other computing devices exceeding its principal power .",
    "however the perpetual failure to do so plus the aforementioned results of a being able to simulate many other notions of computability have eventually led to what has become known as the :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ anything that can be computed in practice , is also computable by a . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    we emphasize that , due to its informal nature , this hypothesis can not be proven formally .",
    "informal arguments in its favor usually point out that computation is a physical process which , by mathematically describing the physical laws it is governed by , can be simulated by a up to arbitrary finite numerical precision ; and infinite accuracy were required only for ` chaotic ' processes which are too sensitive to perturbations than being harnessable for practical computation anyway .",
    "however it has later been pointed out that certain theories of quantum gravitation might actually _ not _ admit a simulation by a @xcite ; furthermore even classical mechanics seems to conceivably provide for processes whose simulation requires infinite precision during _ intermediate _ times only , whereas the resulting behavior is asymptotically stable and thus suited well to realize a non - turing form of physical computation @xcite . moreover the laws of nature we know so far can not be deduced to fundamentally restrict computation @xcite .",
    "in fact neither church nor turing themselves have put forward a claim as universal as the way ` their ' hypothesis is often ( mis-)interpreted @xcite .",
    "instead , literature contains and discusses a rich variety of related hypotheses ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2.2 ) .",
    "anyway , the question remains open whether there might exist a computing device more powerful than the or not .",
    "[ rempost ] already post wondered whether _ any _ super- has the ability to solve the halting problem .",
    "this was settled in the negative by friedberg and muchnik independently showing that there exists an entire hierarchy of undecidable problems strictly ` easier ' than @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely they constructed problems @xmath12 that a can__not _ _ decide , yet access to whose solution ( in terms of an oracle , that is , by permitting queries to some hypothetical external device answering questions `` @xmath13 '' ) provably still does not enable this _",
    "super_- to solve the halting problem .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath5 , such @xmath14 seem to be artificial .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections  5 to 7 ) for a more detailed account of post s problem .",
    "to get an idea towards how a _ _",
    "hyper__computer might look like , theoreticians have started considering super - s and their respective fundamental computing capabilities .",
    "this established the flourishing field of research called ` hypercomputation ' @xcite which entire volumes of significant journals have become dedicated to @xcite .",
    "devising such a formal model ( i.e. , an idealized abstraction ) of a hypercomputer proceeds in many cases less by adding extensions to but rather by removing restrictions from a .

    "finite running time ; 5 .",
    "possibly finite parallelism ( as , e.g. , for a _ nondeterministic _ ) .",
    "irregardless of the details of its precise definition , these finiteness conditions directly imply that there is an at most countable number of different s ; whereas computational problems according to definition  [ defproblem ] exist of cardinality of the continuum .",
    "thus , most of them are undecidable .",

    "recently , several new approaches have been suggested for solving either the halting problem @xcite or hilbert s tenth problem @xcite .",
    "they exploit quantum mechanics and thus form a nice counterpart to previous approaches based on general relativity @xcite as the other pillar of non - classical physics . recalling",
    "that ` standard ' quantum computing does not exceed turing s barrier , these approaches must be non - standard in some sense which closer inspection reveals to be infinite parallelism :    * `` _ _ our quantum algorithm is based on [  ] our ability to implement physically certain hamiltonians having infinite numbers of energy levels _ _ '' ( * ? ? ?",

    "for example the claim `` _ _ to every vector space there exists a basis _ _ '' is of kind  c ) as well as many principles in : each of them is equivalent to the @xcite and thus does not lead to a contradiction to conservative set theory ( c ) but can not be deduced from it ( b ) as has first been proven by k.  gdel in @xcite and later strengthened by p.j .",

    "when is the result to be read off ?",
