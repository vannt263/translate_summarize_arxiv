    "the transit detection of hd  209458  b ( charbonneau et al . 2000 ; henry et al . 2000 ) was a milestone in the study of extrasolar planets . since the first close - in extrasolar giant planet ( cegp ) , 51 peg b",
    ", was discovered in 1995 by mayor & queloz ( 1995 ) , the nature of these unusual type of objects was not truly understood .",
    "eleven more close - in extrasolar giant planets with orbits @xmath8  au are now known .",
    "however , thanks to the transit detection of hd  209458  b , we are certain now that they are indeed gas giant planets , much like our own jupiter and saturn .",
    "the transit of hd  209458  b fixes the orbital inclination ( which removes the @xmath9 ambiguity in mass ) , it gives the planet radius , provides the average planet density , and confirms that the cegps are gas giants .",
    "the crucial parameters for understanding the nature of the extrasolar planet hd  209458  b are its mass and radius , yet an accurate determination depends on our independent knowledge of the mass and radius of its parent star hd  209458 ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ; mazeh et al .",
    "the latter is a solar - like star  a g0 subgiant ( slightly more massive and evolved than our sun ) , and our means to determine its basic physical parameters should be fairly good . however , the demands on precision are so high that current stellar evolution codes and model atmosphere analysis can hardly live up to the challenge . in this paper",
    "we make a detailed analysis of the stellar interior evolution models for hd  209458 , relying on the @xmath10 parallax for its luminosity , @xmath11 , and on the spectroscopic analysis of mazeh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for its effective temperature , @xmath12 , and metallicity , @xmath13 .",
    "our main goal is to quantify the uncertainties and systematic errors that are involved .",
    "an alternative approach is possible : either with multi - color transit photometry ( jha et al .",
    "2000 ; deeg et a. 2001 ) , or with very precise transit photometry ( brown et al .",
    "these studies assume that the stellar mass , @xmath4 , is known and derive @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( a one - parameter description of limb darkening ) .",
    "the procedure reduces the apparent uncertainty in @xmath3 , but since @xmath5 and @xmath14 remain strongly correlated , we suggest an improved approach .",
    "our approach relies on the astrophysical correlation between stellar @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which breaks the degeneracy .",
    "in addition , it is a more robust result of stellar evolution theory than the mass estimate .",
    "the star hd  209458 is extremely similar to our sun from the point of interior modeling ( figure 1 )",
    ". such close similarity allows us to use a theoretical model that is very well constrained for the sun . for many parameters the changes to the hd  209458 interior model are small and we can use solar constraints to test their reliability , e.g. , the size of the convection zone , etc . our code is largely based on the sienkiewicz , paczynski , ratcliff ( 1988 ) code as updated and distributed by r. sienkiewicz , where our changes concern mainly the upper boundary and convection .",
    "it is a henyey code that solves the equations of stellar structure in one dimension .",
    "we use the opal equation of state ( rogers et al .",
    "1996 ) and the latest livermore opacity tables ( opal96 , iglesias & rogers , 1996 ) for the grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) heavy element mixture . the tables are augmented by the alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) data on molecular and grain opacities . the nuclear reaction rates are calculated according to bahcall & pinsonneault ( 1995 ) .",
    "the diffusion of hydrogen and oxygen is treated after thoul , bahcall , & loeb ( 1994 ) .",
    "the upper boundary is an atmosphere with a temperature distribution from model atmosphere integration and kurucz ( 1992 ) opacities ; for models very different from the present sun , the eddington @xmath16 relation is used .",
    "convection is treated with the standard mixing - length prescription and the schwarzschild stability criterion .",
    "slow rigid - body rotation is allowed .",
    "the evolution of the abundances of h,@xmath17he,@xmath18he,@xmath19n , @xmath20o , and @xmath21o is followed .",
    "magnetic fields are not considered .",
    "the zams models are computed with initial guessed values of the boundary parameters taken from the standard solar model for @xmath22=1.0  @xmath23 and scaled for masses in the sun s vicinity .",
    "the subsequent iteration is similar to that used by ford , rasio , & sills ( 1999 ) .    as a check we compared runs with the yale rotating evolution code ( yrec ) for as close as possible initial parameters and overall conditions prepared by d. guenther ( 2000 , private communication ) . despite many differences in assumptions and numerics , the codes compare very well and we use the runs to study possible systematics in our theoretical hd  209458 model ( see  3.3 )",
    "@xmath24 while the evolution code is capable of outputting very precise values for the stellar properties in question , the accuracy of our results was contingent upon the quality of observational data .",
    "an examination of the literature revealed very few studies that have provided physical properties for hd 209458 .",
    "fortunately , however , our work followed on the heels of an extensive spectral analysis performed by mazeh ( 2000 ) .",
    "they derive an effective temperature of @xmath25  k and a metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) of @xmath26 .",
    "we adopted these values but explored a wider range of heavy element abundances than the [ fe / h ] measurement error quoted above .",
    "another crucial parameter under consideration was the stellar luminosity .",
    "we have put to use recent data provided by the @xmath10 space astrometry mission ( esa 1997 , sp-1200 ) , which measured an apparent v magnitude of 7.65 and a parallax of @xmath27 mas for hd  209458 .",
    "assuming negligible interstellar extinction , this implies an absolute magnitude of @xmath28 in v. to transfer from magnitude to luminosity , we applied a bolometric correction ( bc ) , relying on the @xmath12/bc scales derived by flower ( 1996 ) . the star s derived temperature of 6000  k requires a correction factor of @xmath29 . these values indicate a bolometric magnitude of 4.23 , and hence a luminosity @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 in logarithmic units ) .",
    "@xmath24 with all of the requisite physical parameters in hand , we began the stellar modeling process . to guide interpretation of the program output",
    ", we constructed a portion of the h - r diagram with a central temperature / luminosity error box given by our adopted uncertainties ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the limits of this box , 3.7745 to 3.7818 for temperature ( log units ) , and 0.168 to 0.248 for luminosity ( log units ) , indicate the narrow range of `` target '' values imposed by observation . in the search for plausible evolutionary tracks",
    ", we separated the code routine into runs of specific metallicities , including @xmath13  =  0.013 , 0.015 , 0.016 , 0.020 , 0.025 , and 0.031 .",
    "these abundances,$ ] and @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the solar abundances of hydrogen and metals ( by mass ) for @xmath34 . ]",
    "were chosen based on the adopted metallicity range [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath35 .",
    "we elected to use the precise solar values @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( guenther & demarque 1997 ) , and we assumed the stellar initial hydrogen content @xmath38 for hd  209458 . the parameters @xmath13  =  0.016 and @xmath13  =  0.025 were taken to be the lower and upper bounds of allowable metallicities , but a few models with the values 0.013 and 0.031 were used to test more extreme evolutionary behavior .",
    "after computing a grid of models based on the chosen metal abundances , we determined the most favorable evolutionary tracks by retaining only those that met the strict temperature and luminosity requirements",
    ". the results of our modeling can be seen in figure 1 ; a number of theoretical tracks pass through the error box . in proceeding to run the evolutionary code on a wide variety of stellar parameters",
    ", we succeeded in associating with each metallicity a range of masses that yielded acceptable temperatures and luminosities .",
    "we have plotted tracks for the metallicities 0.016 , 0.020 , and 0.025 in figure 1 .",
    "masses shown for @xmath13  =  0.016 are ( in order of decreasing temperature ) 1.009 , 0.990 , and 0.978@xmath39 .",
    "the metallicity of 0.02 , constituting our best estimate for hd  209458 as well as the canonical solar value , was implemented for models of mass 1.15 , 1.10 , 1.09 , 1.06 , 1.05  @xmath23 ( the track for 1.10 is omitted from figure 1 ) .",
    "it was also used in constructing a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) track that can be seen cutting across the left portion of figure 1 .",
    "the upper range of metallicities , 0.025 , was run through the code with masses of 1.175 , 1.13 , 1.12 , and 1.10  @xmath23 ( 1.12 is not plotted in figure 1 ) .",
    "a more complete set of data from the evolutionary tracks is available in table 1 . as evident from the h - r diagram ,",
    "all of the metallicities we have selected have some range of masses that produces models reaching the desired temperature and luminosity ( i.e. passing through the center of the error box ) . while not obvious from the figure , hd  209458 must have a metallicity as high as @xmath13  =  0.05 ( assuming solar hydrogen abundance ) before its evolutionary models no longer intersect the error box .",
    "this situation allows for great freedom in choosing combinations of masses and abundances that match observational data .",
    "therefore , narrowing down the parameters further required restrictions on mass and age .    the age of hd  209458 is not known ; we could only put rough constraints on it from observed levels of stellar activity .",
    "for hd  209458 such constraints happen to make little difference , being somewhere between 4 and 7 gyr of age ( mazeh 2000 ) .",
    "however , it is instructive to see how derived ages correlate with the possible range of stellar metallicity , and eliminate some models that are extraordinarily old or young . for a particular @xmath13-value",
    ", we located three evolutionary tracks of differing mass : one passing directly through the target temperature of 6000  k and luminosity @xmath40 , one that simultaneously reached the highest allowable temperature and lowest luminosity ( thus giving the lowest age ) , and one that reached the highest luminosity and lowest temperature ( giving the greatest age ) .",
    "we then noted the ages for which each model touched the limits of the error box . in the interest of making visual comparisons",
    ", we have plotted all metallicities versus these sets of age extremes in figure 2 .",
    "the results of our modeling reveal that not all of the theoretical evolutionary tracks for hd  209458 that pass through the temperature / luminosity error box evolve to a desirable age .",
    "on the scales that we are interested in , age range and @xmath13 follow an approximately linear relationship .",
    "in fact , no models with metallicity greater than 0.030 ( [ fe / h ]  =  + 0.18 ) or less than 0.012 ( [ fe / h ]  =  -0.22 ) can be considered viable .",
    "therefore , we can be confident that hd  209458 s metallicity is within these two values . given the star s predicted solar metal abundance , this is hardly surprising ; the theoretical models achieving optimal temperatures and luminosities are within a credible zone of abundances .",
    "both the evolutionary tracks and the analysis of stellar age range lend support to the original temperature and luminosity data for hd  209458 : 6000k ( log  =  3.778 ) and 1.61  @xmath41 ( log  =  0.208 ) .",
    "these are the values at the center of our error box , and a model with @xmath13  =  0.02 reaches them when computed with a mass of 1.06  @xmath23 .",
    "it should also be noted that models of mass 1.09 and 1.04  @xmath23 just barely reach the range of reasonable temperatures and luminosities .",
    "all three models remain comfortably within the 4 - 7 gyr range .",
    "the parameters m  =  @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 then describe our best stellar model for hd  209458 with solar metallicity .",
    "if we allow for our assumed range of metallicities , @xmath45 ( @xmath46=0.0\\pm0.1 $ ] ) , then the mass uncertainty increases to @xmath47 .",
    "this is identical to the mass uncertainty ( @xmath48 ) estimated by mazeh ( 2000 ) . propagating all of our errors",
    ", we find a radius of @xmath49 .",
    "the age associated with this combination is 5.2 gyr .",
    "our next step is to take account of other systematic uncertainties .",
    "there are three large sources of uncertainty .",
    "they have to do with the stellar helium abundance ( the surface amount of helium can not be observed in cool stars ) , the diffusion of helium and other heavy elements , and the treatment of convection .",
    "_ the initial abundance of helium , @xmath50 , is an important yet unobservable parameter that influences the stellar evolution model .",
    "thus , we examined the effect of shifting the degree of our models helium enhancements .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the change induced in temperature when @xmath50 is varied by 0.02 ( from the original figure of 0.28 ) , and metallicity is held at a constant @xmath13  =  0.02 . for a helium abundance of 0.26 ,",
    "overall model temperature decreases , and the mass must be raised by @xmath51 in order for the evolutionary track to once again pass through the center of the temperature / luminosity error box . for a higher helium abundance of 0.30 , the opposite is true ; temperature increases , and the model mass must be decreased by @xmath51 to achieve the optimal temperature and luminosity .",
    "in addition , an altered @xmath50-value will cause a slight shift in the stellar age .",
    "our models indicate that an increased helium abundance corresponds to an increase in age for models of similar temperature and luminosity . the best - fit model with @xmath12  =  6000  k and l  =  1.61  @xmath52 increases to 5.7 gyr for a helium abundance of 0.30 , and decreases to 4.7 gyr for an abundance of 0.26 .",
    "in summary , @xmath50 contributes about 4% as a systematic uncertainty to the derived stellar mass for hd  209458 .",
    "_ convection .",
    "_ in using a local prescription to compute the stellar convective envelope @xmath53 the mixing length theory , we have to specify the free mixing length parameter , @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath54 is a number unavailable observationally , we are left to surmise that hd  209458 is similar to the sun in its envelope convection properties .",
    "the comparable temperatures and metallicities of the two stars makes it likely that they share an @xmath54 of 1.69 ( which is the standard solar value ( guenther & demarque 1997 ) . nevertheless , it is instructive to investigate several evolutionary models with several different @xmath54-values , following the findings of multi - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics models of stellar convection ( e.g. , ludwig , freytag , & steffen 1999 ) .",
    "the evolutionary tracks plotted in figure 4 correspond to mixing length parameters of 1.40 , 1.55 , 1.69 ( solar ) , 1.85 , and 2.0 , and they reveal that variations in @xmath54 do indeed have a noticeable effect . increasing the value by 0.15 leads to an overall temperature increase of about 75  k. the mass must be augmented by 0.03  @xmath23 to force the model back through the center of the @xmath12/l error box . for smaller @xmath54",
    "s , the reverse trend occurs .",
    "even more significant , however , are the shifts in age . for a set of models passing through the center of the box ,",
    "decreasing the mixing length parameter to 1.40 pulls hd  209458 s age down to 1.8 gyr , and increasing @xmath54 to 2.00 inflates it to 8.2 gyr .",
    "both numbers are clearly extreme values .",
    "the more moderate @xmath54",
    "=  1.55 and @xmath54  =  1.85 , on the other hand , produce modest jumps in age of about 1.5 gyr . although it is unlikely that extreme mixing length parameter values are the case , they are certainly incompatible with our established temperature and luminosity , unless [ fe / h ] is far different from solar",
    ". therefore the unknown @xmath54 contributes at the 3% level to the uncertainty of the stellar mass ( and much more to the stellar age ) .",
    "_ diffusion .",
    "_ another systematic uncertainty we can quantify is the magnitude of heavy element diffusion .",
    "not accounting for the diffusion of helium produces the offset ( @xmath550.2% ) shown in figure 1 between the known temperature and luminosity of the sun and its theoretical evolution track .",
    "we ran the code for the standard solar values of @xmath56  =  0.7059 , @xmath13  =  0.02 ( guenther & demarque 1997 ) , and @xmath57 . a run with yrec reproduced precisely the effect as well . in summary ,",
    "the systematic uncertainty due to diffusion is much less substantial ( below 1% ) , than the two discussed above .    to combine all uncertainties involved",
    ", we should note the following .",
    "the region of the h - r diagram inhabited by hd 209458 is populated by virtually vertical evolution tracks for our range of @xmath13 and @xmath50 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore the stellar mass determination is subjected to the largest uncertainty , which could only be remedied by a better @xmath12 @xmath58 age derivation .",
    "unfortunately , a better parallax would not help .",
    "a more accurate @xmath12 can not be derived spectroscopically at this time ; even the 50  k uncertainty used here is quite optimistic .",
    "the systematic uncertainties due to @xmath50 and @xmath54 also affect primarily the stellar mass determination .",
    "therefore we have finally : @xmath59 for hd 209458 s mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the stellar radius remains : @xmath60 , and could be improved by a better distance to hd 209458 , @xmath61 a fame parallax .",
    "clearly the linear correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( i.e. , the ratio m / r ) in that small region of parameter space is the most accurate outcome of the theoretical models , because the model systematics are minimized .",
    "@xmath24 to derive the planetary radius ( @xmath62 ) and orbital inclination ( @xmath14 ) from the stellar radius and mass , we employed the light - curve data of brown ( 2001 ) . following the method discussed in sackett ( 1999 ) and used by charbonneau ( 2000 ) and mazeh ( 2000 )",
    ", we constructed the appropriate limb - darkened transit models for hd  209458 .",
    "for this particular analysis , we adopted the same limb darkening parameter , @xmath63 , as mazeh ( 2000 ) : 0.56 .",
    "in addition , we used an orbital period of 3.524739 , obtained by robichon & arenou ( 2000 ) through @xmath10 data . with these values",
    ", we produced a series of transit light curves for selected planetary radii and orbital inclinations and calculated the @xmath64 statistic for each , based on the brown ( 2001 ) photometry .",
    "for @xmath5  =  1.18 and @xmath4  =  1.06 , we derive a planetary radius of @xmath65 , very close to the results of mazeh ( 2000 ) and brown ( 2001 ) . the inclination angle , @xmath14 ,",
    "is @xmath66 .",
    "we can decrease the uncertainties in @xmath62 and @xmath14 by a factor of 2 for hd  209458 by using the theoretical m / r ratio for the star .",
    "two reasons are responsible .",
    "first , as we noted above , the relation minimizes two sources of systematic errors on the stellar mass .",
    "second , and more importantly , the theoretical m / r relation in this small region of the h - r diagram breaks a degeneracy in @xmath5 , @xmath14 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the degeneracy is well - known in light curve solutions of detached eclipsing binary stars with a transit eclipse of a limb - darkened primary ( e.g. , popper 1984 ) .",
    "the times of second and third contact are poorly determined , unless the limb darkening is precisely known ( or zero ) .",
    "often the mass of the primary star , @xmath4 , is used to derive the orbital velocity of the secondary ( unknown for our planet ) in the calculation of the latitude of the transit .",
    "the transit latitude relates @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath14 , and the best fit for @xmath67 is aligned along a positively correlated @xmath4 & @xmath5 .",
    "this positive m / r correlation can be seen in the hd  209458 transit curve solutions of @xmath68 photometry ( brown 2001 ; their fig .",
    "5 ) and multi - color photometry ( deeg 2001 ; their fig . 5 ) .",
    "the latter is @xmath69 .",
    "however , in the vicinity of hd  209458 , the theoretical relation we compute has a negative slope , thus nicely constraining the transit curve solution , as shown in figure 5 . in the neighbourhood of the best value",
    ", we have : @xmath70 the correlation between stellar mass and radius for normal single stars near the main sequence ( masses 1.0 to 1.1@xmath23 ) at _ constant _ luminosity would emerge from the definition of effective temperature .",
    "a hot main sequence star would be smaller than a cool main sequence star of the same @xmath11 , @xmath50 , and @xmath13 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "of course , their ages will differ .",
    "note that the observational determination of @xmath62 , from the analysis of the transit light curve , is done by holding @xmath11 , @xmath50 , and @xmath13 fixed . with virtually vertical evolution tracks ,",
    "the stellar mass , @xmath4 , used in the solution , is practically independent of the stellar @xmath11 in the error box of hd  209458 .",
    "incidentally , @xmath13 is mostly correlated to the @xmath12 in its derivation , as well .",
    "@xmath24 by exploring a wide variety of physical parameters characterizing hd 209458 , we have been able to confirm the general validity of previous metallicity measurements as well as stellar mass and radius calculations , noting the consistencies in age within the regime of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . although the metallicity we have adopted may require adjustments , the models are enough to rule out the possibility that it is far different from solar . with a full set of evolutionary tracks in hand , we can hold the results of @xmath73 and @xmath74 to a high level of confidence . for comparison , the existing theoretical mass and",
    "radius determinations for hd  209458 make use of precalculated evolution model isochrones .",
    "mazeh ( 2000 ) used four different sets of models @xmath53 by schaller ( 1992 ) , bertelli ( 1994 ) , claret ( 1995 ) , and by yi , demarque , & oemler ( 1997 ) . and",
    "in a survey of several hundred thousand stars allende prieto & lambert ( 1999 ) derived a mass and a radius for hd  209458 using isochrones from bertelli ( 1994 ) .",
    "our results differ only in the acknowledgment of two sources of systematic error ( unknown @xmath50 and @xmath54 ) which increase the mass and radius uncertainty for hd  209458 .    the availability of new",
    ", precise transit photometry ( brown 2001 ) only reinforces further the need for better stellar structure models .",
    "our analysis shows that the relevant model input for solving transit light curves is the relation between stellar mass and radius in  3.4 . for future transit systems ,",
    "such mass - radius relations should be derived uniquely from the corresponding evolution models for the parent star . from our derived inclination angle @xmath14 of @xmath75",
    ", we obtain a planetary mass ( dependent on our estimated stellar mass , @xmath76 ) of @xmath77 . with the derived radius , @xmath78",
    ", the planet density would be only @xmath79 .    as noted by burrows ( 2000 )",
    ", the fact that hd  209458  b has a radius - to - mass ratio sufficiently higher than that of jupiter confirms the slowing of the radial shrinking process due to stellar insolation .",
    "they also point out that such a large radius requires the planet to have migrated inward at a fairly early age if it were formed at a distance beyond 0.5au . a better handle on",
    "the planetary radius should allow distinguishing between theoretical evolutionary models for the planet itself , given different overall albedos",
    ". with the discovery of more transiting planets in the near future and with the @xmath80 and @xmath81 missions , our ability to derive good planetary parameters ( radii , masses , & densities ) will depend even more critically on the theoretical stellar models .",
    "the stellar m / r relation is robust along most of the main sequence , and should provide the best constraint for transit light curve solutions and @xmath3 determination .",
