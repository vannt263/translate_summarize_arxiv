    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in quantitative estimates for isoperimetric @xcite , sobolev @xcite , gagliardo - nirenberg @xcite , and brunn - minkowski @xcite type inequalities .",
    "the aim of all of these results is to show that if a set / function almost attains the equality in one of these inequalities , then it is close ( in a quantitative way ) to a minimizer .",
    "these results have natural applications in the study of the asymptotic behavior of solutions to evolution equations @xcite , and to show stability for minimizers of perturbed variational problems , see for instance @xcite .",
    "our goal is to investigate stability for the relative isoperimetric inequality inside convex cones .",
    "this inequality has been used , for instance , to characterize isoperimetric regions inside convex polytopes for small volumes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3 ) .",
    "hence , as in @xcite , one may use our stability result to prove quantitative closeness to such isoperimetric regions in perturbed situations .",
    "let @xmath2 , and @xmath3 be an open , convex cone .",
    "we denote the unit ball in @xmath4 centered at the origin by @xmath5 ( similar notation is used for a generic ball ) and the de giorgi perimeter of @xmath6 relative to @xmath7 by @xmath8 the relative isoperimetric inequality for convex cones states that if @xmath9 is a borel set with finite lebesgue measure @xmath10 , then @xmath11    if @xmath6 has a smooth boundary , the perimeter of @xmath6 is simply the @xmath12-hausdorff measure of the boundary of @xmath6 inside the cone ( i.e. @xmath13 ) .",
    "we also note that if one replaces @xmath7 by @xmath4 , then the above inequality reduces to the classical isoperimetric inequality for which there are many different proofs and formulations ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". however , ( [ i1 ] ) is ultimately due to lions and pacella @xcite ( see also @xcite for a different proof using secord order variations ) .",
    "their proof is based on the brunn - minkowski inequality which states that if @xmath14 are measurable , then @xmath15 ) can be seen as an immediate corollary of the anisotropic isoperimetric inequality .",
    "this fact suggested to us that there should also be a direct proof of ( [ i1 ] ) using optimal transport theory ( see theorem [ 7 ] ) , as is the case for the anisotropic isoperimetric inequality @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper ( in the spirit of @xcite ) is to exploit such a proof in order to establish a quantitative version of ( [ i1 ] ) . to make this precise , we need some more notation .",
    "we define the _ relative isoperimetric deficit _ of a borel set @xmath6 by @xmath16 note that ( [ i1 ] ) implies @xmath17 .",
    "the equality cases were considered in @xcite for the special case when @xmath18 is smooth ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we will work out the general case in theorem [ 7 ] with a self - contained proof .",
    "however , the ( nontrivial ) equality case is not needed in proving the following theorem ( which is in any case a much stronger statement ) :    [ t0 ] let @xmath3 be an open , convex cone containing no lines , @xmath19 , and @xmath9 a set of finite perimeter with @xmath20 .",

    "indeed , if @xmath7 contains a line , then by convexity one can show that ( up to a change of coordinates ) it is of the form @xmath30 , with @xmath31 an open , convex cone .",
    "therefore , by taking @xmath6 to be a translated version of @xmath32 along the first coordinate , the symmetric difference will be positive , whereas the relative deficit will remain @xmath33 .    in general ( up to a change of coordinates )",

    "then there exists a constant @xmath23 such that @xmath38    let us remark that if @xmath39 , then @xmath25 and the theorem reduces to the main result of @xcite , the only difference being that here we do not attempt to find any explicit upper bound on the constant @xmath40 .",
    "however , since all of our arguments are  constructive , \" it is possible to find explicit upper bounds on @xmath40 in terms on @xmath41 and the geometry of @xmath7 ( see also section 1.4 ) .",

    "their proof uses a technique based on optimal transport theory . for more information about the history of ( [ b3 ] ) , we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .      we now provide a short sketch of the proof of theorem [ t1 ] for the case when @xmath69 and @xmath6 has a smooth boundary .",
    "the first key observation is that the relative isoperimetric inequality inside a convex cone is a direct consequence of the anisotropic isoperimetric inequality with @xmath19 . indeed , as follows from the argument in section [ sect : isop ineq ] , @xmath70 , so follows immediately from .",

    "indeed , we can show that there exists a vector @xmath71 such that such that ( [ 12r ] ) holds is exactly the main result in @xcite .",

    "thanks to ( [ 12e ] ) , we see that our result would readily follow if we can show @xmath83 ( see lemmas [ 17 ] & [ 18 ] ) , @xmath84 which , of course , implies theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "therefore , we are left with proving ( [ t16 ] ) .",
    "firstly , assume that @xmath81 and @xmath85 are sufficiently small ( i.e. smaller than a constant depending only on @xmath41 and @xmath32 ) . by ( [ 12a ] ) and the fact that ( see section @xmath86 ) @xmath87 we have @xmath88 but since @xmath85 is small , @xmath89 ; hence , @xmath90 moreover , thanks to the relative isoperimetric inequality inside @xmath91 ( see e.g. ( * ? ?",

    "next , we briefly discuss the assumptions for the sketch of the proof above .",
    "indeed , one may remove the size assumption on @xmath85 by showing that if @xmath81 is small enough , then @xmath85 will be automatically small ( see proposition [ 29 ] ) . controls @xmath99 ; hence , we want to avoid any compactness argument .",
