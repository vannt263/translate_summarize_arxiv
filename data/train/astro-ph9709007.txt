    "for many years we have known that galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) radiate x - rays in one of several spectral states , switching suddenly from one to another .",
    "although intermediate states are sometimes also seen , the spectral states of gbhcs are best typified by their extremes : a  hard \" state ( sometimes also called the  low \" state because the 2  10 kev flux is relatively weak in this state ) , and a  soft \" state ( sometimes also called the  high \" state because the 2  10 kev flux is relatively strong ) .",
    "the spectrum in both states may be roughly described as the sum of two components : a blackbody , and a power - law with an exponential cut - off . in the soft state",
    "the blackbody is relatively prominent and the power - law is steep ; in the hard state more energy is carried in the power - law , whose slope is then shallower .",
    "more specifically , in the soft state ( ss ) , the 0.1  5  kev band is dominated by a component best described as either a blackbody with temperature 0.3  1  kev , or perhaps a sum of blackbodies all with temperatures in that range @xcite . the slope ( in energy units ) of the power - law between 5 and 40",
    "kev is generally 1.0  1.5 @xcite .",
    "osse and rxte data , when fitted with a model consisting of a power - law with an exponential cut - off , show slopes between 1.6 and 2.1 and a cut - off energy ( although not very well determined ) @xmath2 kev ( grove et al .",

    "1996 and gierliski et al .",

    "most of the energy is emitted in the soft thermal component .    in the hard state",
    "( hs ) , the soft component is much less luminous , and can be represented by a black body with a temperature 0.1 - 0.2  kev @xcite .",
    "most of the energy is emitted in the hard tail , which can be represented by a power - law of slope 0.3  0.7 with an exponential cut - off at about 100 kev @xcite .",
    "the _ ginga _",
    "spectrum of cyg x-1 also shows a clear sign of hardening at about 10 kev accompanied by a fluorescent fe k@xmath3 line at @xmath4 6.4 kev .",
    "these effects are most easily interpreted as the signature of compton reflection from cold matter in the vicinity of the hard x/@xmath5-ray source . in this interpretation ,",
    "the strength of the fe k@xmath3 line and the reflection bump requires the cold matter to subtend a solid angle @xmath6 around the hard x - ray source @xcite .",
    "it was originally thought that these systems were much more luminous in the soft state than in the hard .",
    "however , in a striking new result , zhang et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have shown that the _ bolometric _ luminosity of cyg x-1 changes only slightly despite dramatic changes in spectral shape . in view of this",
    ", we eschew the designations  high \" and  low \" , and strongly urge that in the future these states be called  soft \" and  hard \" .",
    "what exactly is happening in these sources when they switch spectral state has long been a puzzle .",
    "however , in recent years advances have been made both on the observational side ( most importantly , hard x - ray / soft @xmath5-ray observations now give us a clearer picture of that portion of the spectrum ) and on the theoretical side ( we now understand much better how thermal comptonization works when the seed photons are produced in large part by reprocessing part of the hard x - ray output ) . making use of this progress",
    ", we can now use the observed character of the spectrum in these states to determine the geometry and energy dissipation distribution in an accreting black hole system in _ all _ its different spectral states .",
    "the geometry and energy dissipation distribution inferred purely on the basis of _ radiation _ physics can then be used to guide efforts to obtain _ dynamical _ explanations for the changes in spectral state . because the observational data are best for cyg x-1 , we illustrate our method here by applying it to that source .",
    "as will be seen , even in this example , there are still uncertainties which prevent some of our conclusions from being as strong as might be possible in principle , but the bulk of this program is now realizable in the case of cyg x-1 , and it may soon be possible to extend it to other sources .",
    "we attribute the two components with which the spectra are fit to two physically distinct , but related , regions : an optically thick , quasi - thermal region which is responsible for the blackbody component ( the accretion disc ? ) ; and an optically thin very hot region which radiates the hard x - rays ( a corona ? ) .",
    "we call the intrinsic dissipation rates in the  disc \" and  corona \" @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the scale over which the  disc \" radiates most of its energy is @xmath9 .",
    "following the consensus in the field @xcite , we suppose that the hard x - rays are produced by thermal comptonization .",
    "the seed photons for this process are partly created locally ( by thermal bremsstrahlung or synchro - cyclotron radiation : narayan & yi 1995 ) and are partly created in the quasi - thermal region .",
    "the luminosity of the quasi - thermal region is in turn partly due to local energy dissipation , and partly due to reradiation of hard x - rays created in the  corona \" .    in this model ,",
    "the shape of the comptonized spectrum produced by the  corona \" may be quite adequately described phenomenologically by two parameters : the power - law slope @xmath3 , the exponential cut - off energy @xmath10 .",
    "two more parameters ( the effective temperature @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) define the soft part of the radiation .",
    "the ratio of the observed hard luminosity to the observed soft luminosity , @xmath13 , and the magnitude of the reflection bump @xmath14 ( @xmath15 corresponds to the amplitude of reflection expected from a slab subtending a @xmath16 solid angle around an isotropic x - ray source atop the slab ) complete the set of observables .",
    "these phenomenological parameters are determined by two dimensional quantities , the total dissipation rate and @xmath9 , and four dimensionless physical parameters : the ratio @xmath17 ; the compton optical depth of the  corona \" @xmath18 ; the fraction @xmath19 of the light emitted by the thermal region which passes through the  corona \" ; and the ratio @xmath20 of intrinsic seed photon production in the  corona \" to the seed photon luminosity injected from outside .",
    "another dimensionless parameter , the compactness @xmath21 , may be used to determine the relative importance of @xmath22 pairs in the corona ( @xmath23 is the size of the corona ) . in this context",
    "it is also useful to distinguish the net lepton compton optical depth @xmath24 from the total compton optical depth ( including pairs ) , @xmath18",
    ".    we will show how all these parameters , as well as several others of physical interest , may be inferred from observable quantities .",
    "the observables on which we base this analysis for cyg x-1 are shown in table 1 . because cyg x-1 varies , the numbers seen at any particular time may be somewhat different from the  typical \" values we cite .",
    "[ tab:1 ]    .observational characteristics of cyg x-1 in its soft and hard states [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath25electron temperature , @xmath26 + @xmath27ratio of intrinsic soft luminosity to the intrinsic hard luminosity ( all the correction factors are here assumed to combine to unity ) + @xmath28inner radius of the cold disc + @xmath29covering fraction of  corona \" around thermal disc times the seed photon correction factor + @xmath30radial thomson optical depth of the hot cloud + @xmath31inner radius of the disc relative to the hot cloud + @xmath32elevation of the corona above to the disc relative to the size of the hot cloud + @xmath33hard compactness , @xmath34    we can determine from figure  [ fig : dc ] that in the hard state @xmath35 .",
    "this corresponds to an almost spherical corona .",
    "the cold disc penetrates only a short way into the corona ( see gierliski et al .",
    "1997a and dove et al .",
    "1997 for a similar conclusion ) .",
    "if the disc were filled , relatively small @xmath36 could be achieved for large @xmath37 due to electron scattering of the reflection component , but it would be difficult to get @xmath19 small .",
    "the same argument also holds if the corona is larger than the disc ( it would be easy to find geometries in which @xmath36 is small , but then it becomes more difficult for @xmath19 to also be small ) . in the soft state , @xmath38 , so that the corona is slightly elongated along the axis of the system ( an outflow ? ) .",
    "now , the corona covers a significant fraction of the inner disc ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "there is , of course , some uncertainty in determining @xmath36 and @xmath19 from observations .",
    "@xmath36 is usually known with @xmath40 accuracy .",
    "this translates into similar uncertainty in @xmath41 , and @xmath42 uncertainty in @xmath43 .",
    "estimations of @xmath19 that are uncertain within a factor of 2 ( mostly due to the strong dependence on the spectral index @xmath3 ) translate to @xmath44 and @xmath45 uncertainty in @xmath41 for the ss and hs , respectively , while @xmath43 is almost unaffected .",
    "to verify these approximate arguments and refine our estimates of the inferred system parameters , we have computed exact numerical equilibria for a variety of parameters .",
    "we solved energy balance and electron - positron pair balance equations coupled with the radiative transfer .",
    "this was done using the code described in poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) .",
    "we assumed that the corona is spherical and centered on the black hole ( i.e. @xmath46 ) , based on the fact that in both states the derived value of @xmath43 is significantly smaller than 1 .",
    "we divided these calculations into two sets , one designed to mimic the hard state , the other the soft .",
    "all but one of the system parameters needed to define an equilibrium are given by the analytic estimates of the previous section .",
    "the one exception is @xmath24 , the net lepton optical depth .",
    "although the total optical depth @xmath18 is reasonably well determined by observations , @xmath24 is not , because there is no easy way to tell from observations what portion of the compton opacity is due to @xmath22 pairs . in terms of the ratio @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the one free parameter of the calculations is therefore @xmath24 .    in the hard state models , we fixed @xmath49 , @xmath50  kev , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , and let @xmath53 , 1.0 , and 2.0 ( models hs1 , hs2 , hs3 , respectively ) .",
    "calculations gave ( @xmath18 , @xmath54 , @xmath55)= ( 0.87 , 0.39 , @xmath56 ) for model hs1 , ( 1.12 , 0.31 , 0.06 ) for hs2 , and ( 2.001 , 0.16 , 0.0002 ) for hs3 . selected predicted spectra are compared with observations in figure  [ fig : fit ] .",
    "when @xmath57 , pairs dominate , and @xmath58 ; @xmath59 leads to @xmath60 , and the greater optical depth depresses the electron temperature .",
    "the best agreement with the observed spectrum ( and the quality of this agreement is actually quite good ) is found with @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a state in which the pair contribution is negligible ( assuming that pairs are thermal ) .",
    "thus , the approximate parameters of table 2 come very close both to a truly self - consistent equilibrium , and to producing an output spectrum like the one seen .",
    "= 8.4 cm    [ fig : fit ]    in the soft state models we fixed @xmath62 , @xmath63  kev , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , and let @xmath66 0 , 0.1 , and 0.3 ( models ss1 , ss2 , ss3 , respectively ) .",
    "we find the following results : ( @xmath18 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) = ( 0.24 , 0.37 , @xmath56 ) for model ss1 , ( 0.25 , 0.37 , 0.75 ) for ss2 , and ( 0.32 , 0.31 , 0.03 ) for ss3 .    in many respects ,",
    "the soft state is quite similar to the hard state ; it differs primarily in having roughly an order of magnitude smaller optical depth , and in the much greater importance of intrinsically generated soft photons .",
    "these changes do not alter very much the critical @xmath24 below which pairs dominate : it is still a few tenths .",
    "however , in contrast to the hard state , the best agreement with observations ( and this fit is again quite satisfactory ) is found with @xmath67 .",
    "again we see that the analytic arguments are reasonably good guides to the results of more exact calculation .",
    "these inferences allow several strong conclusions to be made .",
    "most importantly , the fact that such a self - consistent picture may be drawn gives additional support to the basic picture of thermal comptonization for the origin of the hard x - rays .",
    "this suggestion was part of the original proposal of shapiro et al .",
    "( 1976 ) , who suggested that in the hard state , the inner portion of the accretion disc puffs up into a hot comptonizing corona . their picture of the geometry is also confirmed .",
    "in addition , we now see that in the soft state the disc extends inward almost as far as it can , while the corona surrounds it out to several gravitational radii .    we are also now able to see that the disc receives only a minority of the dissipation in the hard state , but is the site of most of the heat release in the soft state .",
    "this conclusion is especially robust , for it depends primarily on the single ratio @xmath13 . if we have overestimated @xmath12 in the hard state , the fraction of the dissipation taking place in the disc becomes even smaller .",
    "the radius of the disc s inner edge shrinks by roughly a factor of 5 between the hard state and the soft state .",
    "this ratio is somewhat sensitive to several uncertainties .",
    "first , @xmath68^{1/2}$ ] , and second , @xmath9 in the soft state can be affected by uncertainty in the scaling factors @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in terms of gravitational radii @xmath73 , @xmath74 in the hard state , and @xmath75 in the soft state . here",
    "@xmath76 is the mass of the black hole scaled to @xmath77 , the best estimate of herrero et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "estimates of @xmath9 , combined with the intrinsic luminosity of the disc , also permit us to place strong bounds on the mass accretion rate through the disc , @xmath78 .",
    "almost independent of the spin of the black hole , mass passing through a thin disc extending outward from the @xmath79 inferred for the hard state has a net binding energy @xmath80 of its rest mass .",
    "the intrinsic disc luminosity , at least , must be drawn from this store of energy ; @xmath78 in the hard state must then be at least @xmath81  yr@xmath1 ( this estimate is sensitive to uncertainty in @xmath12 ; it scales roughly @xmath82^{3/2}$ ] ) .",
    "the greatest possible @xmath78 would be required if all the energy for coronal heating is taken from matter accreting through the disc ( that is , inside @xmath9 , the specific angular momentum of the matter changes , but not its specific energy ) . that upper bound is @xmath83  yr@xmath1 . in the soft state ,",
    "the efficiency of the disc varies from @xmath84 ( zero spin ) to @xmath85 ( maximum rotation ) .",
    "similar reasoning then gives a lower bound of 0.7 ",
    "@xmath86  yr@xmath1 and an upper bound only about 20% greater ( because nearly all the luminosity in the soft state is radiated by the disc ) .",
    "if @xmath78 in the hard state is near the lower bound , the efficiency of the inner corona in the hard state must be @xmath87 in order to explain the total luminosity .",
    "if so , the black hole would have to be rotating relatively rapidly .",
    "it is also of interest to compare @xmath78 to the accretion rate which would produce an eddington luminosity if radiation were created at the efficiency of a maximal kerr black hole@xmath88 yr@xmath1 . in those units ,",
    "the estimates of the previous paragraph give normalized accretion rates @xmath89 ( or possibly as high as @xmath90 ) in the hard state , and @xmath85  0.2 in the soft state .",
    "meanwhile , the corona shrinks in radial scale by only half as much as the disc when cyg x-1 moves from the hard state to the soft . in the latter state",
    ", it covers a sizable portion of the inner disc . despite the sharp change in size and luminosity , the compactness of the corona changes by no more than a factor of a few ( incorporating the uncertainty in @xmath9 ) as a result of the hard - soft transition .",
    "however , its optical depth drops by an order of magnitude .",
    "although there are few @xmath22 pairs in the equilibrium characterizing the hard state , they can be comparable in number to the net electrons in the soft state .",
    "this fact also means that the fall in @xmath24 from the hard state to the soft is even greater than the fall in @xmath18 .",
    "we close by noting that in the hard state there must be a hole in the central region of the thermal disc which is much bigger than the radius of the innermost stable orbit .",
    "the origin of this hole is a question of prime importance .",
    "one possibility arises from the fact that the disc becomes dominated by radiation pressure inside @xmath91 gravitational radii . as shown by shakura & sunyaev ( 1976 ) , in the strict @xmath3-model ,",
    "radiation pressure - dominated discs are thermally unstable .",
    "it is interesting that the inner radius of the disc in the hard state corresponds quite closely to this possible point of instability .",
    "we are then left with the question of how a thin disc is able to persist in to much smaller radius in the soft state , when @xmath92 is still @xmath93 .",
    "another possibility is that the inner disc in the hard state is advection - dominated , while in the soft state the accretion rate is just a bit too high for that to happen @xcite . while the creation of an advection - dominated region may be a nonlinear end - state of the thermal instability , so that this model provides an attractive explanation for the hard state , it also leaves open how the thin disc survives thermal instability in the soft state .",
