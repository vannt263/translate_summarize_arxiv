    "brightest cluster galaxies and most luminous early - type galaxies brighter than @xmath3 have `` cores '' in their central starlight distributions @xcite .",
    "cores are marked by a distinct physical radius interior to which the projected starlight surface - brightness increases only slowly as @xmath4 in marked contrast to the surrounding envelope , which has a much steeper profile ( in logarithmic units ) . in qualitative terms , a core looks like a central `` plateau '' in the starlight distribution . in more quantitative terms",
    ", a core can be defined as the central region of a galaxy where the surface brightness takes the form of a shallow cusp , @xmath5 with @xmath6 as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "importantly , galaxies fainter than @xmath3 generally do not have cores , having @xmath8 instead , as @xmath9 this distinction is of physical interest , as the presence or absence of a core correlates with the strength of the stellar rotation field , isophote shape , nuclear radio emission , and overall x - ray emission , in addition to the total galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "the formation of cores has long been thought to be due to the action of black holes on the central structure of galaxies .",
    "their form and size may reflect both the mass of the central black hole in the galaxies , and the merger history that created the galaxies .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that a binary black hole created in the merger of two galaxies would eject stars from the center of the newly created system as the binary slowly hardened . in simple terms , the black hole",
    "binary `` scours '' out the center of the galaxy , thus `` flattening '' the otherwise steeply rising central starlight distribution as @xmath9 subsequent n - body simulations have demonstrated this phenomenon , directly @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that cores occur in the most luminous elliptical galaxies , and are correlated with slow - rotation and `` boxy '' isophotes in these galaxies , concluding that core formation is a natural end - point of dissipationless mergers of two progenitor elliptical galaxies .",
    "the conclusion that nearly every elliptical galaxy has a black hole at its center @xcite , coupled with the conclusion that the most massive elliptical galaxies were formed by merging pre - existing gas - free galaxies , explains why cores are found in nearly all luminous ellipticals .",
    "while `` core scouring '' is an attractive hypothesis for the formation of cores , there may be additional mechanisms for binary black holes to generate cores .",
    "@xcite suggested that when the two black holes in the binary ultimately merge , asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation could eject the merged hole from the center of the galaxy , causing the center to `` rebound '' in response to the large reduction in central mass .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite studied this problem in detail for realistic galaxy models , demonstrating that the ejection of the merged black hole indeed could cause the central distribution of starlight to re - adjust such that it would create a core in the projected stellar surface brightness profile .",
    "an interesting ancillary effect discussed in these works is the possibility that the ejected black hole would remain bound to the host galaxy on a radial orbit . in that case",
    ", it would repeatedly fall through the center of the galaxy , continuing to enlarge the core through dynamical friction .",
    "some observational support for the scouring origin of cores comes from the measurement of core `` mass deficits '' compared to the black hole masses in the same galaxies @xcite .",
    "the mass deficit , @xmath10 is the inferred mass of stars ejected from the center of the galaxy requited to create a core , and is estimated by a reference to a postulated initial form of the galaxy fitted to the envelope , such as a s ' ersic law @xcite .",
    "various studies estimating mass deficits @xcite typically find @xmath11 the black hole mass , with the constant of proportionality of order unity , but with large scatter about the mean relation .",
    "the observational context for understanding the large core in the brightest cluster galaxy in abell 2261 ( hereafter referred to as a2261-bcg ) is provided by the extensive work done with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) on the structure of nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite constructed a large sample of galaxies that had high - resolution surface photometry obtained with _",
    "hst ; _ significantly , it included the core parameters measured by @xcite , who studied a large sample of brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "very few galaxies have cores as large as 1 kpc ; the largest core in the @xcite sample is that for ngc 6166 = a2199-bcg , which has a core size of @xmath12 kpc .",
    "@xcite drew attention to the large core that they discovered in bcg ms0735.6 + 7421 ; however , it is compatible with the largest bcg cores measured in the @xcite sample .",
    "the core in a2261-bcg , however , is over twice as large as that in ngc 6166 .",
    "it provides an extreme test of the possible mechanisms hypothesized to generate cores .",
    "the center of abell 2261 was observed for a total of 20 orbits as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( clash ) multi - cycle treasury program between march 9 , 2011 and may 21 , 2011 in 16 broadband filters from @xmath13 @xcite . for the calculation of physical quantities , we assume a cosmology with @xmath14 and @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 . at the mean redshift of abell 2261 , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 subtends 3.61 kpc and the distance modulus is 40.241 .",
    "abell 2261 is included in the clash x - ray selected subsample of 20 clusters .",
    "the clash x - ray selected sample consists of clusters with x - ray temperatures greater than 5 kev and exhibit a high degree of dynamical relaxation as evidenced by _ chandra x - ray observatory _ images that show well - defined central surface brightness peaks and nearly concentric isophotes . the intracluster medium ( icm ) of abell 2261 , in particular , is characterized by an x - ray temperature of t@xmath19 kev , a bolometric x - ray luminosity of @xmath20 erg s@xmath16 and a [ fe / h ] abundance ratio that is @xmath21 times the solar value @xcite . the estimated mass within r@xmath22 ( radius where the density is 2500 times the critical density ) is @xmath23 with a gas fraction of @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite found abell 2261 to have a small level of substructure in its x - ray gas surface brightness distribution and @xcite classified the cluster as  disturbed . \"",
    "@xcite find that application of the caustic technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) to spectroscopically measured galaxies in the vicinity of abell 2261 suggests that the dynamical center of the cluster is located @xmath25 ( @xmath261.3 mpc ) south of the bcg .",
    "however , the bcg ( @xmath27 ) in abell 2261 is at equatorial coordinates of 17:22:27.18 @xmath2832:07:57.1 ( j2000 ) , putting it within @xmath29 ( 5.8 kpc ) of the centroid of the icm x - ray emission .",
    "its mean velocity offset relative to that of the cluster mean redshift is 367 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the distribution of bcg velocity offsets for a sample of 42 abell clusters has a mean value of 264 km s@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "an expanded dataset of 174 abell clusters , each with at least 50 spectroscopically confirmed members , yields a mean value of the bcg velocity offset of 234 km s@xmath16 , with 22% having offsets of at least 350 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the a2261-bcg , thus , appears to be reasonably aligned with the center of the cluster s main gravitational potential well .",
    "the unusual core of a2261-bcg was discovered during the initial inspection of the clash _ hst _ images of a2261 .",
    "visually , the core presents itself as a large , round , uniform disk of low surface brightness , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : a2261 ] , which shows a color composite of the central @xmath30 region of abell 2261 made from the clash images .",
    "in addition , four compact sources with colors similar to the bcg itself are superimposed on the outskirts of the core .",
    "the 3 brightest knots are marginally detected ( @xmath31 ) in the wfc3/uvis f336w image , well detected ( @xmath32 ) at longer wavelengths , and not detected in either the f225w or f275w uvis passbands .",
    "understanding the central structure of a2261-bcg requires knowledge of whether or not the core hosts a central supermassive black hole .",
    "this problem will be considered at length later in the paper , but we note here that the center of the galaxy does harbor a radio source that is at least an order of magnitude more powerful than those associated with star forming regions , and is thus evidence in favor of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) finds a source at 1.4 ghz with an integrated flux of @xmath33 mjy that lies @xmath34 east of the bcg position .",
    "no other nvss sources are found within @xmath35 of the bcg .",
    "data from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) survey @xcite reveals a 3.4 mjy source that is more coincident with the core , lying @xmath29 west of the bcg position .",
    "the first detection limit at the source position is 0.99 mjy per beam .",
    "no other first sources are found within @xmath36 of the bcg .",
    "presumably the nvss and first detections closest to the bcg correspond to the same source .",
    "the two radio positions are @xmath37 apart , which is less than a @xmath38 difference and is consistent with the different astrometric uncertainties for the two surveys .",
    "unfortunately , the vla sky survey data currently do not have sufficient angular resolution to determine whether one of the knots , or the core itself , may host the agn ( vla first resolution is @xmath39 , nvss resolution is @xmath40 ) .",
    "if the radio source is at the cluster redshift then the first detection yields an absolute luminosity of @xmath41 at 1.4ghz corresponding to @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite also find a central source with luminosity @xmath43 at 5 ghz corresponding to @xmath44 .",
    "the radio fluxes are indicative of a mildly powerful fr i radio source typical of those seen in bcgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    apart from the radio source , there is also a faint @xmath45 detection of 0.44 mjy @xcite , which would indicate either star formation or a hot dust torus around an agn . as in the case of the radio observations , however , the angular resolution is probably too poor to distinguish whether or not the flux comes from the center of the core or any of the associated knots .",
    "in contrast , optical spectra do not reveal any significant evidence of emission lines that may be associated with an agn or cooling flow activity ( the spectra are presented in the next subsection ) .",
    "further , there are no known x - ray or euv sources identified with any of the compact knots ; the x - ray limit on any point source in the core is @xmath46 @xcite . at the same time , it is typical for central radio source in bcgs not to have strong x - ray counterparts .",
    "a black hole mass of @xmath47 is in general consistent with the power requirements associated with the icm shock fronts seen in other clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; but for such high mass black holes , the power needed for such shocks is only @xmath48 which therefore implies that the black holes can be radiatively inefficient .",
    "@xcite note that synchrotron cooling can strongly affect the x - ray luminosity from the most massive black holes since the cooling break occurs below x - ray wavelengths , making such massive black holes underluminous at x - ray wavelengths compared to their radio luminosity .",
    "for a2261-bcg in particular , @xcite estimate an eddingtion ratio of @xmath49      the details of the image reduction and co - addition of the abell 2261 _ hst _ observations are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analyses of the bcg profile here is based on the f606w and f814w hst clash images .",
    "the acs photometry is on the ab magnitude system but we will express much of the reduced photometry in rest - frame v - band ( vega - based ) for compatibility with the @xcite analysis of central galaxy photometry .",
    "we use a suite of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) synthetic stellar population models to derive linear photometric transformations from the observed , extinction - corrected acs / wfc magnitudes and colors to the rest - frame johnson v - band , @xmath50 .",
    "the bc03 models used to empirically derive the transformation equations have the following parameters : exponential star formation rate e - folding times , @xmath51 , of 0 gyr ( ssp model ) , 0.2 gyr , 0.6 gyr , and 1.0 gyr ; metallicities of 0.25@xmath52 , 1.0@xmath52 , and 2.5@xmath52 , and ages from 2 gyr to the age of the universe at the cluster redshift in 0.5 gyr intervals .",
    "these models more than span the range of observed cluster galaxy seds . to compute photometric transformations ,",
    "we take the bc03 spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for each of the above models and compute the observed photometry and colors at the cluster redshift and then use the same seds to compute the rest - frame johnson v magnitude .",
    "the transformation equation parameters are then derived using a linear least - squares fitting procedure .",
    "in addition , we compute an evolution correction , @xmath53 , from a bc03 @xmath54 gyr solar metallicity model with a formation epoch of @xmath55 .",
    "the transformation equation is : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 where f606w and f814w are the galactic extinction - corrected acs / wfc measurements in ab - magnitudes , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is on the vega system .",
    "the extinction corrections used are @xmath62 mag and @xmath63 mag for the f606w and f814w filters , respectively .",
    "the rms scatter about the transformation equation shown in equation 1 is 0.006 mag .",
    "we tested the robustness of the method by computing similar transformations for f625w and ( f625w - f814w ) and for f850lp and ( f814w - f850lp ) .",
    "they yield the same rest - frame @xmath61 values to within @xmath64 magnitudes .",
    "the total luminosity of a2261-bcg was determined by fitting its surface photometry with an @xmath65 law .",
    "this is consistent with the methodology in @xcite , which will be used to provide the context for the present galaxy .",
    "the bcg is highly luminous with a total absolute magnitude of @xmath66 in the v - band ( see table [ tab : galphot ] ) .",
    "because we want to compare this to the @xmath67 sample of bcgs , this luminosity includes an evolutionary correction of @xmath68 mag to account for the aging of the stellar population since the @xmath69 epoch .",
    "even then , a2261-bcg is among the most luminous bcgs known @xcite .",
    "four sources fall within the outskirts of the core .",
    "their coordinates and photometric properties are summarized in table  [ tab : galphot ] .",
    "the brightest source ,  knot 3 , \" is well resolved .",
    "its profile was measured simultaneously with the bcg ( as is described in @xmath70 ) and has a roughly exponential form .",
    "the close pair of compact sources north - east of the core center , knots 1 and 2 , are both marginally resolved with @xmath71 half - intensity radii .",
    "the faint source south of the core , knot 4 , is unresolved .",
    "the photometric errors in table  [ tab : galphot ] given here include both the random and estimated systematic errors .",
    "the random errors ( photon shot noise , read noise , dark current ) are in the range 0.005 mag to 0.010 mag .",
    "the systematic errors are relatively small but still about 2 to 4 times larger than the corresponding random errors .",
    "this is due to spatial variations in the background level after the bcg model is subtracted from the image . to estimate the amplitude of the systematic error we compared the knot photometry derived from the bcg - subtracted image with that derived by using a local sky subtraction ( instead of bcg subtraction ) where the background is estimated from an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath72 and an outer radius of @xmath73 centered on each knot .",
    "the two measures of the photometry typically agree to within 0.015 mag to 0.020 mag . based on this , we adopt 0.018 mag as an estimate of the systematic error .",

    "the increase in the central surface brightness within the core after deconvolution is only @xmath89 with similar effect on the measured angular size of the core .",
    "the real import of deconvolution for a2261-bcg is to recover the forms of the compact sources falling around the core , and to reduce the effects of their scattering `` wings '' on the core , itself .",
    "figure [ fig : core ] also shows the residuals obtained after a 2d model reconstructed from the brightness profile of the core was subtracted from the image . the profile for @xmath90",

    "if cores are created by the scouring action of a binary black hole , and the core size is indicative of the mass of the binary , then the implied black hole mass for a2261-bcg must be extremely large .",
    "@xcite recently identified two black holes with masses @xmath148 or greater in the bcgs a1367-bcg = ngc 3842 and a1656-bcg = ngc 4889 , which have cusp - radii of only @xmath149 kpc and @xmath150 kpc , respectively @xcite , implying that @xmath151 in a2261-bcg is yet larger than that found in those two galaxies .",
    "the @xmath152 and @xmath153 relations between nuclear black hole mass and galaxy luminosity @xcite or velocity dispersion @xcite give some guidance on what to expect for the central black hole mass in a2261-bcg , completely apart from its core structure .",
    "the @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( elliptical galaxy only sample ) relations from the comprehensive analysis of @xcite predict @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively .",
    "the analogous @xcite @xmath152 and @xmath153 relations , which as noted above include bcg black hole masses , predict somewhat higher values of @xmath156 and @xmath157 it should be noted that a2261-bcg is more luminous and has a higher velocity dispersion than any galaxy that actually has a black hole mass measurement , thus the predictions are extrapolations .",
    "a different approach is to use the fundamental - plane of black hole activity @xcite , which derives @xmath151 from a combination of 5 ghz core radio luminosity and @xmath158 kev nuclear x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite use this methodology to estimate @xmath159 for a2261-bcg .",
    "unfortunately , estimates of black hole mass implied by the scale of the core , itself , in a2261-bcg will be even more uncertain extrapolations .",
    "@xcite presented a number of relationships between @xmath144 and @xmath160 based on how the sample of core galaxies with real @xmath151 determinations was analyzed .",
    "if @xmath144 and @xmath151 are fitted symmetrically , then @xcite find @xmath161 which predicts @xmath162 for a2261-bcg .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath151 is treated as the independent variable , then @xcite find @xmath163 which predicts a more modest @xmath164 the large difference between the two estimates is due to the small number of systems contributing to the @xcite @xmath165 relationships and the large scatter between the two parameters .    an alternate approach advocated in several papers is to relate estimates of the `` mass - deficit , '' @xmath10 that is the mass in stars that was ejected to generate the core , to @xmath166",
    "unfortunately , this methodology at present also leads to large uncertainties in the estimated @xmath151 for a2261-bcg . @xcite",
    "derive a relationship between @xmath167 and @xmath151 for galaxies of the form @xmath168 where @xmath167 is the observed _ starlight _ rather than inferred mass deficit , and is measured by integrating the central difference between the observed surface brightness profile and an inward extrapolation of a s ' ersic - law fitted to the envelope of the galaxy .",
    "the best fit of a s ' ersic law to the envelope of a2261-bcg has @xmath169 or essentially the classic @xmath65-law form .",
    "an @xmath65-law fitted to the envelope gives @xmath170 implying @xmath171 using the @xcite relation .",
    "this later @xmath167 is identical to the @xmath172 derived by the simple estimate of `` core - luminosity , '' @xmath173 used by @xcite as a proxy for @xmath167 that avoids the need for the careful selection and evaluation of a `` pre - scouring '' reference surface brightness profile .",
    "one intriguing possibility is that the large flat core has resulted from the central ejection of its nuclear black hole . in this scenario ,",
    "the galaxy most likely had a large core to begin with , which would have been enlarged by the ejection of the central black hole .",
    "the large core would have been generated by a smaller black hole than that directly implied by the presumption that scouring by the binary black hole did all the work .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that a core can be generated directly in a `` power - law '' galaxy ( a system that initially has a steep central cusp ) when the components of a binary black hole merge and the remnant is ejected by the asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "@xcite simulated this scenario , finding that that ejection can substantially enlarge a pre - existing core , leading to the inference of an exceptionally large mass deficit .",
    "given the high luminosity of a2261-bcg , it is extremely likely that it would have a large core prior to any ejection of a central black hole . @xcite",
    "also show that the central stellar density profiles can become extremely flat after ejection of the black hole , similar to what is seen in figure [ fig : den ] .",
    "the physical displacement of the core from the envelope center , noted above , is indicative of a local dynamical disturbance .",
    "this is likely to be a relatively recent event .",
    "an ejected black hole would be trailed by a strong dynamical - friction wake as it leaves the core . in effect",
    ", it would `` pluck '' the core , which would then oscillate for a few crossing times , @xmath174 or @xmath175 yr for a2261-bcg . at the same time , this need not mean that the ejection of the black hole , itself , needs to be as recent . if the ejected black hole remains on a radial orbit that periodically returns to the core , then the disturbance might only be due to a recent passage ( merritt , private communication )",
    ".    real proof of the ejected black hole hypothesis would be to find direct evidence of the ejected black hole , itself .",
    "@xcite show that the ejected black hole carries along with it a `` cloak '' of stars that had previously been closely bound to it .",
    "the ejected black hole and associated stars would somewhat resemble a globular cluster or ultra - compact dwarf galaxy .",
    "the key diagnostic for such a system would be the extremely high velocity dispersion of the tightly bound stars .",
    "an obvious question then for the present case is if any of the four sources proximal to the core might be such an object .",
    "an important point is that the stellar `` cloak '' is most likely to be considerably less massive than the black hole . for a black hole ejected from a core ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath176 where , @xmath177 is the mass of stars bound to the black hole , @xmath82 is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy , and @xmath178 is the `` kick '' velocity with which the newly merged binary black hole is ejected from the center of the galaxy . in the case of a2261-bcg with @xmath179",
    "the coefficient in the above equation becomes 0.1 . while we have echoed the nominal @xmath180 from @xcite , the real value depends on the unknown mass ratio and spins of the two black holes within the merging binary and can range from essentially zero to a few thousand km  s@xmath16 .",
    "the only way to constrain @xmath178 better would be to identify the remnant and measure its line - of - sight velocity .",
    "@xcite also show that the effective radius of the cloak is also related to the kick velocity . for a black hole initially in a core , @xmath181 given the expected scale and mass of the stellar cloak , the best candidate for an ejected black hole would be the least luminous of the four sources , the unresolved point source south of the core .",
    "the most luminous of the four sources has an implied luminosity of @xmath182 and a substantially larger physical extent than the number given above .",
    "when converted to a likely mass , the source carries a substantial fraction of the putative @xmath148 black hole , thus not matching the expectation that @xmath183 morphologically , the source also resembles any number of other small galaxies visible within the neighborhood of the bcg .",
    "the two less luminous paired - sources , also north of the core , are more consistent with a possible cloak , but even their compact sizes are large for the expectations enumerated above .",
    "of course if @xmath178 is large , and the ejection happened long ago , then the remnant would be unlikely to be within the core , and the candidate list would have to be extended to sources at much larger distances from the center of the bcg . the time scale for exiting the core",
    "is simply @xmath184 which is likely to be substantially shorter than @xmath185 conversely , a small kick favors larger and more extended cloaks , and increases the likelihood that the remnant would remain close to the core in the event that the kick was insufficient to unbind the black hole from the bcg , itself .",
    "if the offset core is indeed due to an ejected black hole , then the short lifetime of the offset would imply that the remnant should be relatively close by .",
    "there is a rich tradition in observational astrophysics of using the extreme member of an ensemble to understand the origin of the ensemble over all .",
    "the role of a2261-bcg as a witness to the mechanisms that form cores hinges on whether its core is `` normal '' or not .",
    "a2261-bcg bests its closest rival , ngc 6166 , for having the largest core by a factor of two .",
    "more generally , the core of a2261-bcg stands out from all galaxies in the subset of 57 bcgs in the @xcite composite sample of early type galaxies imaged with _ hst _ ( the great majority of the bcgs were provided by @xcite ) .",
    "still , the core @xmath186 kpc does not fall far above the @xcite @xmath187 relationship , given that a2261-bcg also has an unusually large total luminosity  even as compared to other bcgs .",
    "a2261-bcg might be expected to harbor a @xmath1 black hole , based on its location within the @xmath152 and @xmath153 relations , thus the formation of core in this galaxy would _ a priori _ be expected to a limiting case for the formation of the core by core scouring , the standard hypothesis .",
    "the core of a2261-bcg was not at first noted for its size , as much as its unusual appearance , however .",
    "cores generally have at least a weak central surface brightness cusp , but in a2261-bcg there is no obvious center to the core .",
    "its central stellar density profile is perfectly flat , or perhaps even depressed at the center .",
    "while there is a radio source coincident with the core , there is no optical agn counterpart or central nuclear star cluster  nothing suggests that a2261-bcg is hosting anything like a @xmath1 black hole at its center .",
    "if binary black holes do scour out cores , then on occasion they must also merge and be ejected from the core , thus causing it to rebound and expand to an even larger size than it possessed at the completion of scouring .",
    "an attractive feature of this scenario is that it may account for large cores that may be difficult to explain by scouring alone .",
    "the simulations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that the core of a2261-bcg matches the expectations of what a core that has ejected its central black hole looks like .",
    "there is a caveat , however",
    ". cores with ejected black holes may be ephemeral .",
    "@xcite note that a central black hole can act as  guardian , \"  protecting \" an existing core from being infilled by the central cannibalism of less luminous , but centrally denser galaxies .",
    "a2261-bcg lives in a rich environment .",
    "figure [ fig : den ] shows that the central mass density of the core is @xmath188 which is extremely diffuse in comparison to the denser cores of less luminous galaxies . without a central black hole in the core of a2261-bcg , the nuclei of galaxies merging with the bcg would readily settle intact into its center @xcite .",
    "the four sources projected against the core , are a reminder that the galaxy may cannibalize its neighbors , even if the sources in question , may themselves not be at risk for this . again , if a2261-bcg did lose its central black hole , this may have been a relatively recent event .    in the end ,",
    "how we use a2261-bcg to test the theory of core formation hinges on whether or not it now hosts a supermassive black hole at its center .",
    "the radius interior to which a black hole dominates the stellar dynamics is @xmath189 for a @xmath1 black hole and @xmath190 @xmath191 or @xmath192 for a2261-bcg .",
    "this scale is readily accessible using adaptive optics in the near - ir on 10m - class telescopes , with the caveat that the extremely low surface brightness interior to the core will demand long exposures , even with such large apertures .",
    "the detection of a _ central _ @xmath193 would suggest that the core is simply an extreme example of the scouring mechanism .",
    "conversely , a demonstration that a2261-bcg lacks a suitably massive black hole , or the possible demonstration that one of the sources near the core is a cloaked black hole could establish that the large core indeed was generated by the ejection of its central black hole .",
    "an improved position for the central radio source might also determine if a black hole truly lies at the center of the core , or instead is associated with one of the knots .",
