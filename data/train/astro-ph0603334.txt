    "izotov and thuan ( 2004 ; hereinafter it04 ) presented the primordial helium abundance @xmath7 , consistently with their earlier publications ( izotov and thuan 1998 , and references therein ) , from helium recombination lines in metal poor extragalactic hii regions .",
    "this is significantly higher than the earlier values given by a number of authors ( pagel et al .",
    "1992 ; olive et al . 1997 ; peimbert et al .",
    "2000 ) , yet is significantly lower by three standard deviations than the expectation from the baryon abundance constrained from cmb temperature anisotropies ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) with the aid of big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "particularly intriguing is the small errors which are common to nearly all analyses .",
    "we suspect that this might not represent properly the error including systematics .",
    "it04 provided high quality spectroscopic data for 33 hii regions detailed enough for us to repeat the analysis . in this paper",
    "we are particularly concerned with the effect induced by underlying stellar absorption on nebula helium emission lines that is poorly constrained .",
    "our analysis is along the line of peimbert et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and olive and skillman ( 2004 ; hereinafter os04 ) , who introduced the helium absorption strength as a free parameter , although ours are somewhat more conservative . os04 and peimbert et al .",
    "( 2000 ; 2002 ) presented an analysis in which plasma temperature is also determined by the helium emission lines alone .",
    "however , this , in principle proper approach given accurate data , induces large errors in the resulting helium abundance with the present accuracy of the available data for distant hii regions , and a trend that might be brought about with the inclusion of stellar absorption is buried in the noise . since we do not see a compelling reason that plasma temperatures from helium and oxygen are significantly different , we take the approach that plasma temperature is determined by the ratio of oxygen emission lines , as was done in most of the work including it04 , and study the effect of stellar absorption by introducing it as a free parameter .",
    "we show that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are very sensitive to the introduction of the underlying stellar absorption of the helium lines .",
    "we consider 30 of the 33 h ii regions given in it04 , discarding 3 h ii regions ( um133 , mrk1063 , hs0111 + 2115 ) , for which he i @xmath84026 line is not detected",
    ". we also add ngc346 ( region a ) studied by peimbert et al .",
    "the 31 h ii regions we studied are shown in table 1 , where our final results are also presented .",
    "the plasma temperature of oiii is determined from the ratio of [ o iii ] emissions @xmath84363 versus @xmath94959,5007 .",
    "the extinction and stellar absorption of h i balmer lines are derived from h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 and h@xmath13 using the recombination calculation of hummer & storey ( 1987 ) for the intrinsic line intensity ratios @xmath14 , as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the observed line intensity , @xmath17 is the equivalent width , @xmath18 is the stellar absorption and @xmath19 is the extinction relative to h@xmath11 .",
    "the inclusion of h9 and higher balmer lines , where available , does not modify the result beyond our interest .",
    "h8 is blended with he i@xmath83889 , and equation ( [ eq : hemis ] ) is used to deblend the helium line .",
    "we discard h7 that is deblended with [ ne iii ] .",
    "we use the extinction curve of odonnel ( 1994 ) , but the use of the different extinction curve leads only to a small difference that can be ignored here .",
    "we consider six he i lines , five lines for orthohelium @xmath83890 ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath84026 ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath84471 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath85875 ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath87065 ( @xmath20 ) , and one line for parahelium @xmath86678 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the @xmath83890 and @xmath87065 are sensitive to a fluorescent correction and thus to the radiative transfer .",
    "@xmath84026 is generally weak , susceptible largely to stellar absorption .",
    "we use the effective recombination coefficients of benjamin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which include collisional excitation , and the radiative transfer calculation of benjamin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for fluorescent corrections , @xmath24 , which is controlled by the optical depth @xmath25 .",
    "we calculate the abundance of singly ionised helium as @xmath26 this is the same as that adopted by os04 and that by it04 up to the inclusion of @xmath27 .",
    "we do not know what ratios are to be taken for @xmath27 for different lines .",
    "we assume here that all absorption strengths are identical in equivalent strengths , as was done in os04 .",
    "this is probably not too bad an approximation in view of the observation for absorption in b stars ( lennon et al . 1993 ; lyubimkov et al .",
    "2000 ) and the size of the resulting errors in our calculation that amount to @xmath2850% of the central values : more detailed line ratios are the matter at a higher order level .",
    "we refer to olive & skillman ( 2001 ) for more detailed discussion for this issue .",
    "our method of analysis differs from the usual one to find the parameters .",
    "we find the best likelihood solution in full four parameter space @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( electron density ) , @xmath27 and @xmath31 for six lines , rather than minimising the sum of @xmath32 for each line , which has been adopted in the literature , for the purpose to take the correlation among the lines into account .",
    "the electron density is poorly constrained , but its indeterminacy affects the resulting @xmath33 little due to its very weak dependence in the recombination coefficient .",
    "we add the abundance of doubly ionised helium @xmath34 to calculate @xmath33 when he ii @xmath84686 is detected .",
    "we take the oxygen abundance from it04 .",
    "the final results are displayed for the mass fraction of helium @xmath33 as a function of the oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen o / h , and linear extrapolation is employed to obtain the primordial helium abundance @xmath0 in the zero oxygen abundance limit ( peimbert & torres - peimbert 1974 ) , @xmath35 we adopt @xmath36 from it04 .",
    "extinction and stellar absorption of the hydrogen lines are determined from the 4 balmer lines .",
    "the extinction parameter @xmath37 agrees very well with those of it04 in spite of the different extinction curves used .",
    "curiously , the stellar absorption we derived is generally somewhat larger than that of it04 , although we do not claim that the two are inconsistent since errors are generally large . for most of the case absorption strengths",
    "lie in the range of @xmath38 , but for two it is larger than 10 .",
    "the mean is @xmath39 , where the error stands for the standard deviation .",
    "this is a natural value for hii regions .",
    "as noted by os04 , we find negative values for absorptions for 11 hii regions .",
    "this occurrence is expected from a large scatter in @xmath18 , but might be ascribed to the collisional excitation for hydrogen emission lines that are not taken into account . in any case , the error induced by resetting the negative absorption width to zero will be small for the helium emissivity analysis , since the reference h@xmath11 has a large equivalent width @xmath40 .    to confirm that our results agree with those of it04 when he i stellar absorption is ignored , we first carry out the analysis assuming @xmath41 .",
    "the helium abundance plotted as a function of the oxygen abundance [ o / h ] presented in figure 1(a ) confirms the trend seen in it04 , although individual data scatter more with our analysis .",
    "we obtain @xmath42 consistent with @xmath43 from the extrapolation of the results tabulated in it04 [ see figure 2(a ) ] for individual hii regions but do not give @xmath0 for their new data alone .",
    "they combined with their 1998 data and present @xmath44 . ]",
    "our @xmath32 is rather poor : the mean is @xmath45 .",
    "there are five cases ( hs 0122 + 0743 , mrk724 , pox36 , hs0128 + 2832 and mrk 1236 ) that give @xmath46 , implying the inadequacy of the procedure we assumed .",
    "when we include @xmath27 as a free parameter , and carry out a similar analysis , @xmath32 is enormously improved : we find @xmath47 , which is dominated by a few bad fits , notably by one system giving @xmath48 with the zero he i absorption width .",
    "for all cases , except one , that showed poor @xmath32 with @xmath41 , fits are greatly improved .",
    "in particular for the five cases of poor fit we noted above @xmath32 drops from 29.5 to 1.2 for hs0122 + 0743 , 10.1 to 2.5 for mrk724 , 10.1 to 1.0 for pox36 .",
    "and 18.5 to 0.9 for hs0128 + 2832 , and from 10.6 to 4.4 for mrk 1236 , indicating the need to take the stellar absorption into account .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the plot that can be compared with figure 1(a ) but with a non - vanishing @xmath27 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the derived helium abundance is more strongly affected for metal poor hii regions , pushing up the helium abundance extrapolated to the zero metallicity quite a bit and resulting in @xmath49 .",
    "note that the large scatter around the extrapolation line seen in panel ( a ) is not visible in this plot any more .",
    "the @xmath32 curves are given in figure 2(a ) for @xmath0 and for @xmath50 ( b ) which is discussed below .",
    "the absorption widths derived from our fit have generally large errors , @xmath51% .",
    "the mean absorption equivalent widths are @xmath52 .",
    "there are 6 hii regions for which the central values of @xmath27 are negative .",
    "the four among six are the cases for which the fits without stellar absorption gave unusually good @xmath32 .",
    "the only cases that are marginally acceptable are with hs1028 + 3843 ( @xmath53 ) and mrk35 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "( in the analysis with @xmath41 , 10 systems have @xmath32 greater than 6.1 . )",
    "os04 presented their analysis for seven hii regions common in our sample .",
    "a comparison shows that our y is always consistent with theirs within one standard deviation , although the errors are significantly larger in os04 due to larger uncertainties in the temperature of the plasma .",
    "we find other parameters , such as temperature , are also consistent .",
    "figure 3 shows the average absorption equivalent width that varies with the heavy element abundance .",
    "although individual data show a rather large scatter , the trend is clear in this binned plot : the stellar absorption effect is more important for metal poor hii regions .",
    "since the oxygen abundance shows a tight anticorrelation with temperature of the plasma , this figure is also interpreted as showing the correlation of the stellar absorption with the plasma temperature : higher the temperature , more the important absorption .",
    "this is the systematic trend that largely modifies the extrapolation of the helium abundance to the zero metallicity .    in this connection",
    "another interesting quantity is @xmath54 , i.e. , the increment of helium per heavy element production .",
    "the it04 results give @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 , which is consistent with the final result it04 quoted , @xmath57 ) from a sample of seven hii regions .",
    "our analysis with @xmath27 set equal to zero gives @xmath58 or @xmath59 . on the other hand , with stellar absorption",
    "we obtain @xmath60 or @xmath61 , which is a drastic decrease .",
    "we remark that it04 use only 3 lines in deriving the helium abundance , dropping @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with the anticipation that the other 3 bright lines are less affected by stellar absorption , while they use @xmath62 and @xmath64 to constrain other parameters .",
    "we also tried to drop the three lines when we calculate @xmath33 , but the results remain unchanged from the full 6 line analysis .",
    "using the it04 sample we showed that the neglect of the stellar absorption on the helium emission lines causes a large systematic effect on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the stellar absorption equivalent width shows a trend that increases towards metal poor systems .",
    "the inclusion of helium stellar absorption improves enormously the acceptance of fit to the he i emission data , especially when the quality was bad without the inclusion of stellar absorption .",
    "the resulting magnitude of the absorption equivalent width of he i @xmath65 line ( and also of the h i balmer lines ) is on the order that is expected in a population synthesis calculation ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1999 ) for the nebula phase .    with the inclusion of stellar absorption we obtained the primordial helium abundance increased from @xmath66 to @xmath3 .",
    "we do not claim that the latter is the true value , but it is much preferred to the former on the ground of much smaller @xmath32 for the fit to individual hii regions , while the 6-line fit without stellar absorption is barely acceptable . or , most conservatively , one can claim that we can not obtain the primordial helium abundance to the error of @xmath67 or less unless underlying stellar absorption is properly understood .      if we accept our higher helium abundance , we find @xmath68 with the aid of the standard big bang nucleosynthesis calculation ( e.g. , olive et al .",
    "this baryon abundance is consistent with that inferred from cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we also found that @xmath1 is largely affected upon the inclusion of stellar absorption : the original value of @xmath69 decreases to @xmath70 .",
    "this smaller number is consistent with the derivative inferred form the standard solar model ( bahcall et al .",
    "2001 ) @xmath71 , and also with @xmath72 from the dwarf star atmosphere ( jimenez et al .",
    "2003 ) using the method introduced by pagel and portinari ( 1998 ) who presented @xmath73 for this derivative .",
