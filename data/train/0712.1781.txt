    "the homogenization theory aims to find an effective description of materials whose heterogeneities scale is much smaller than the size of the body .",
    "the simplest example is periodic homogenization for which the microstructure is assumed to be periodically distributed within the material . in the framework of the calculus of variations ,",
    "periodic homogenization problems rest on the study of equilibrium states , or minimizers , of integral functionals of the form @xmath1 under suitable boundary conditions , where @xmath2 is a bounded open set and @xmath3 is some oscillating integrand with respect to the first variable . to understand the asymptotic behavior of ( almost ) minimizers of such energies , it is convenient to perform a @xmath4-convergence analysis ( see @xcite for a detailed description of this subject ) which is an adequate theory to study such variational problems .",
    "it is usual to assume that the integrand @xmath5 satisfies uniform @xmath6-growth and @xmath6-coercivity conditions ( with @xmath7 ) so that one should ask the admissible fields to belong to the sobolev space @xmath8 . for energies with superlinear growth , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath9 , this problem has a quite long history , and we refer to @xcite in the convex case . then it has received the most general answer in the independent works of @xcite and @xcite , showing that such materials asymptotically behave like homogeneous ones .",
    "these results have been subsequently generalized into a lot of different manners .",
    "let us mention @xcite where the authors add a surface energy term allowing for fractured media . in that case ,",
    "sobolev spaces are not adapted to take into account eventual discontinuities of the deformation field across the cracks .    in many applications admissible fields have to satisfy additional constraints .",
    "this is for example the case in the study of equilibria for liquid crystals , in ferromagnetism or for magnetostrictive materials where the order parameters take their values into a given manifold .",
    "it then becomes necessary to understand the behaviour of integral functionals of the type ( [ mainfunct ] ) under this additional constraint . for fixed @xmath10 , the possible lack of lower semicontinuity of the energy may prevent the existence of minimizers ( with eventual boundary conditions ) .",
    "it leads to compute its relaxation under the manifold constraint . in the framework of sobolev spaces ,",
    "it has been studied in @xcite , and the relaxed energy is obtained by replacing the integrand by its tangential quasiconvexification which is the analogue of the quasiconvex envelope in the non constrained case .",
    "we finally mention a slightly different problem originally introduced in @xcite , where the energy is assumed to be finite only for smooth maps .",
    "recent generalizations can be found in @xcite where the study is performed within the framework of cartesian currents ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it shows the emergence in the relaxation process of non local effects of topological nature related to the non density of smooth maps ( see @xcite ) .",
