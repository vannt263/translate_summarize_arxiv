    "pulsar j1738 + 0333 is one of seven recycled pulsars discovered in a high - galactic latitude ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 parkes multi - beam pulsar survey @xcite .",
    "it has a spin period @xmath17 of 5.85 ms and it is located in a low - eccentricity ( @xmath18 ) binary system with an orbital period ( @xmath19 ) of 8.5 hours ; the projected semi - major axis of the pulsar orbit ( @xmath20 ) is 0.3434 light seconds .",
    "the parkes timing determined a phase - coherent timing solution with precise spin , orbital and astrometric parameters that allowed the detection of the companion of the pulsar at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the results of the optical observations of the companion are described in detail by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth paper i ) ; it is a white dwarf ( wd ) , and from its spectrum they estimate its mass @xmath21 ( 1-@xmath7 , where @xmath22 represents one solar mass ; we also define @xmath23 ) .",
    "the paper also presents measurements of the doppler shifts of the wd spectral lines which are used to estimate the systemic radial velocity @xmath24 and the semi - amplitude of the wd orbital velocity projected along the line of sight @xmath25 , consistent ( but significantly more precise ) with the value obtained by @xcite , @xmath26 .",
    "this measurement is combined with its pulsar equivalent @xmath27 to estimate the mass ratio : @xmath28 .",
    "given @xmath29 , this implies a pulsar mass @xmath30 . finally , from kepler s laws they derive an orbital inclination @xmath31 .",
    "the position pf psr  j1738@xmath00333 makes it detectable with the arecibo observatory s 305-m william e. gordon radio telescope , which provides about 15 times the sensitivity of the parkes telescope and therefore allows much more precise timing .",
    "regular arecibo observations of psr  j1738@xmath00333  started in 2003 .",
    "given the mass measurements obtained from the optical / radio data , and the knowledge that @xmath18 , general relativity ( gr ) predicts an orbital decay of @xmath32 ( henceforth fss@xmath4 ) due to the emission of gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "our early simulations suggested that using arecibo we would be able to measure this effect within a few years .",
    "the organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : observations ] we describe in detail the observations and how the pulse times of arrival and the timing solution were derived . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss the detection of the orbital decay of the system .",
    "we compare it with the prediction from gr , and derive an upper limit for any excess gw emission . in section  [ sec :",
    "generic ] , we use this limit to derive an upper limit for the emission of dipolar gws . in the following sections , we discuss the implications of this result for alternative theories of gravity , specifically in section  [ sec : ste ] for tensor - scalar theories of gravity and in section  [ sec : teves ] for a class of tensor - vector - scalar theories of gravity similar to the theory proposed by @xcite , which is a relativistic formulation of the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) proposed by @xcite . finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our results and highlight the prospects opened by continued timing of this system .",
    ", width=321 ]      psr  j1738@xmath00333  was discovered with the 64-m parkes telescope in an observation taken in 2001 .",
    "we started timing it regularly on 2001 september 26 using the 21-cm multi - beam receiver system and the @xmath33 filterbank .",
    "the parkes datataking and processing are described in detail in @xcite .    in august 2003",
    "we started regular observations of this msp using the l - wide receiver of the 305-m william e. gordon telescope at the arecibo observatory and the wide - band arecibo pulsar processors ( wapps ) to process the signal .",
    "the wapps are general - purpose auto - correlators capable of processing a band of up to 100 mhz each @xcite .",
    "first , they digitise the incoming voltages as 3-level values .",
    "the machine then calculates the auto - correlation function ( acf ) for a specified number of time lags , in our case 256 .",
    "these are integrated for a time @xmath34 of 64@xmath35s , after which they are written to disk as 16-bit integers for later off - line analysis .",
    "the four wapps were centered at frequencies @xmath36 of 1170 , 1310 , 1410 and 1510 mhz .",
    "the acfs from the wapps are , later on , read from disk during off - line processing .",
    "first , they are fourier transformed using duncan lorimer s sigproc routine `` filterbank '' , producing 100 mhz - wide , 256-channel power spectra . to eliminate signal distortions caused by the edges of the wapp bands we set the values of the lower and higher 16 channels to zero , all other channel values are unchanged .",
    "these spectra are then divided into four sub - bands .",
    "each of these is dedispersed at the dm of the pulsar .",
    "the resulting time series is then folded modulo the pulsar rotational period , using a polynomial expansion of the pulsar spin phase as a function of time predicted by the best existing ephemeris . for each of these sub - bands ,",
    "the pulses are integrated for 4 minutes as single 512-bin pulse profiles . only on days",
    "when the pulsar is consistently faint ( the flux density changes because of scintillation caused by the interstellar medium ) do we integrate the pulse profiles for 600 seconds .",
    "all of this processing is done using the `` sig_foldpow '' routine , written by one of us ( ihs ) .",
    "given the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm , a measurement of the column density of free electrons between the earth and the pulsar ) of 33.77@xmath37pc , the dispersive smearing per channel ( with bandwidth @xmath38 ) was @xmath39 68.3 , 48.7 , 39.0 and 31.8@xmath40s per channel respectively .",
    "the total time resolution @xmath41 was therefore 93.6 , 80.4 , 75.0 and @xmath42s respectively .    producing a large number of such profiles",
    "has many advantages : a ) the separation in frequency allows the use of polynomial coefficients derived specifically for the radio frequency of each sub - band in such a way that the orbital phase of the binary is constant for the pulse arrival time at each frequency , not constant for a particular time .",
    "this is very important for systems with short orbital periods like psr  j1738@xmath00333 , where the difference in arrival times at the lower and upper edges of the band caused by dispersion by the ionized interstellar medium corresponds to a non - negligible shift in the orbital phase .",
    "b ) the production of many toas in time preserves the important orbital information contained in them .",
    "c ) by having small bandwidths and integration times , we minimize profile smearing due to imperfections in the ephemeris and dm model . finally , d ) we take full advantage of the power of scintillation  in some occasions , the signal - to - noise ratio in a 25 mhz@xmath434-minute subsection is larger than for the whole observation .              the best pulse profile , resulting from more than 1 hour of data , is displayed in fig .  [ fig : profile ] .",
    "the narrow central component is the cause of the excellent timing precision for this pulsar .",
    "this profile does not show significant changes with radio frequency beyond what one should expect from the change in time resolution of the system @xmath44 with frequency .",
    "for this reason , the best profile is then cross - correlated with _",
    "all _ the 4-minute/25 mhz pulse profiles in the fourier domain @xcite ; the phase offset that yields the best match is used to derive the time of arrival ( toa ) of a particular pulse ( normally that closest to the start of each sub - integration ) measured at the local ( topocentric ) time frame .",
    "in total we obtain 17376 toas from arecibo data .",
    "the previous number of parkes measurements is 100 .",
    "we carry out subsequent toa analysis using the tempo2 software package @xcite .",
    "this uses the clock corrections intrinsic to the observatory , the earth rotation data and the observatory coordinates to convert the topocentric toas to terrestrial time ( tt ) , as maintained by the bureau international des poids et mesures . from these tempo2 derives arrival times at the solar system barycentre using the position of the observatory that is calculated using the de / le  421 solar system ephemeris @xcite ; for details see @xcite .",
    "these , like our timing parameters , are expressed in barycentric coordinate time ( tcb ) .    with the correct rotation count",
    ", tempo2 can vary the timing parameters in order to minimize the difference between the observed and predicted barycentric toas ( the timing residuals ) .",
    "the residuals are weighted according to the estimated uncertainty of each toa .",
    "the resulting set of timing parameters constitutes a preliminary phase - coherent timing solution ( an `` ephemeris '' ) .",
    "if the toa uncertainties are under - estimated , or if there are systematics present in the data , the reduced @xmath45 of the fit will be larger than 1 .",
    "for this preliminary ephemeris , the reduced @xmath45 is 2.05 , which , as we show below , is mostly caused by variations in the intervening electron column density .",
    "the main advantage of having wapp search data stored on disk and doing the analysis off - line is that it allows for iterative improvement of the pulsar ephemeris ; this process is particularly important at the earlier stages when the ephemeris is not yet very precise . with each improved ephemeris , we dedispersed and folded the data again , obtaining pulse profiles with improved signal - to - noise ratio ; which are then used to derive better toas that further improve the ephemeris .",
    "this avoids orbital phase - dependent smearing of the pulse profiles and the creation of orbital phase - dependent timing artefacts , which can corrupt the determination of orbital parameters , particularly the orbital phase and orbital period variation @xcite .    at the early stages of our timing programme",
    ", we checked the timing accuracy of the wapps by making a few simultaneous observations with the arecibo signal processor ( asp ) .",
    "the asp is a real - time coherent dedispersion system implemented in software , which can process 64 mhz of baseband signal @xcite and is known to provide very stable timing .",
    "no significant differences in the timing of the two back - ends was found , this implies that , within measurement precision , the wapp timing is accurate .",
    "the preliminary ephemeris described above assumes a constant dm . as we can see in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals ] , this ephemeris describes the toas rather poorly , with large trends in the post - fit residuals .",
    "these are especially noticeable once we calculate daily residual averages .",
    "we used this preliminary ephemeris to measure the pulsar s dm for each day of observations .",
    "this is only possible because of the wide band of the l - wide receiver at arecibo  from 1120 to 1730 mhz , of which we used the cleanest parts , 1120 - 1220 mhz and 1260 - 1560 mhz .",
    "the results of these measurements are presented in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals ] .",
    "the dm varies significantly with time , and its variation correlates with the daily residual averages ; this implies that the latter must , to a large extent , be caused by the former .",
    "they have amplitudes of the order of 0.002  @xmath37 pc , which cause extra dispersive delays of the order of 4  @xmath40s , and a dominant timescale of the order of a few years .",
    "this is similar to the timescales associated with gws from super massive black hole binaries .",
    "this highlights the importance of accurate and dense multi - frequency toa measurements and precise dm corrections when attempting to detect such waves with pulsar timing @xcite .",
    "these dm variations can not be described by a simple linear variation with time .",
    "for this reason , we included eight dm derivatives in our definitive timing model , which is presented in table  [ tab : parameters ] ; the uncertainties were derived by tempo2 except where stated otherwise .",
    "this dm model describes the daily dm measurements very well ( see left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals ] ) ; but is only valid within the time interval for which we have significant multi - frequency data , i.e. , since the start of the arecibo observations in 2003 .",
    "the predicted values start diverging fast outside this range , but this does not affect the results discussed in this paper .",
    "this method has the benefit that any possible correlations of the coefficients of the dm model with the timing parameters are taken into account , leading to more conservative ( and in our opinion more realistic ) estimates of the parameter uncertainties .",
    "this ephemeris describes the toas much better than the preliminary ephemeris , as displayed in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals_corrected ]",
    ". however , there are still systematic variations in the daily residual averages , these excursions reach a maximum of about 0.5 @xmath40s and have timescales of a few months to a year . in order to estimate the timing parameters with more realistic uncertainties , we added an uncertainty of 0.5 @xmath40s in quadrature to the estimated uncertainty of every toa .",
    "this rescaling of our errors results in a reduced @xmath45 of 1 for short timescales and 1.02 for the whole data set , suggesting that the uncertainties on the derived parameters are reliable .",
    "however , given the systematic nature of these excursions , small systematics on parameters with comparable timescales ( in particular the parallax ) may remain . on the other hand",
    ", there should be no correlation with orbital phase , hence orbital parameters should not be affected at all .",
    "these excursions are likely to be caused by variations of the dm at timescales of a few months that can not be taken into account by the 8-polynomial model for the dm variations .",
    "the alternative explanations are not as plausible : an instability in the rotation of the pulsar would produce excursions with larger timescales than those observed .",
    "the second derivative of the spin frequency [ @xmath46 is consistent with zero , which suggests good long - term stability ; the same is true for the third frequency derivative .",
    "furthermore , the agreement between nearby daily residual averages suggests that the timing system used is stable .    to further verify the integrity of this timing solution , we compared its predictions with toas taken with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in the netherlands , which uses the puma ii coherent dedispersion back - end @xcite .",
    "the 345 mhz data are especially useful because , in case of an inaccuracy in our dm model they would show significant trends .",
    "it is remarkable that , despite the fact that the model represents mostly an interpolation during the 20092010 gap , no trends are discernible in either dataset ( see right plot of fig .  [",
    "fig : residuals_corrected ] ) .",

    "we compare it with the gr prediction in section  [ sec : excess_decay ] .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : timing_model ] , the quoted uncertainty for the parallax is likely to be too small given the systematic effects caused by uncorrected short - term dm variations .",

    "( 4.14 ) of @xcite , where the scalar field is no longer sourced by the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , as in standard scalar - tensor theories , but by the same combination ( @xmath291 ) as the gravitational potential .",

    "the consequence of this extra symmetry of teves is that the dipolar radiation predicted by eq .",
    "( [ pdotdipole ] ) merely vanishes , and asymmetrical neutron star - white dwarf binaries like psr  j1738@xmath00333  no longer provide any stringent constraints .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tevesplane ] , where several binary - pulsar tests now present a bump on the vertical axis , @xmath219 . as compared to fig .",
    "[ scalartensorplane ] , the main effect of the non - conformal matter - scalar coupling assumed in teves - like models is thus to displace these bumps from @xmath293 or @xmath294 to the axis @xmath219 .    for generic teves - like models with @xmath295 , we find again that psr  j1738@xmath00333  is the most constraining binary pulsar .",
    "we also note that several binary pulsar tests are now _ more _ constraining than all solar - system experiments ( i.e. , the llr line of fig .",
    "[ tevesplane ] , while the perihelion shift of mercury @xcite gives even weaker constraints , and all deflection or time - delay predictions coincide with those of gr at the first post - newtonian order ) .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the most natural value of the linear matter - scalar coupling constant @xmath209 would be of order unity .",
    "figure  [ tevesplane ] shows this is experimentally forbidden , even on the vertical axis @xmath219 thanks to several binary pulsars whose tests do not rely on the magnitude of the dipolar radiation .",
    "they actually impose that @xmath296 , therefore teves needs to assume an unnatural shape of the function defining its scalar s dynamics .    a possible way to avoid fine tuning in teves - like models has been proposed in @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath297 can be consistent with solar - system and binary - pulsar tests , thanks to a screening of all scalar - field effects at small distances .",
    "therefore , the results of the present paper do not rule out teves , but show that its original 2004 formulation by bekenstein may need to be amended . at present ,",
    "even its original writing is consistent , although it does need some tuning .",
    "it is quite fortunate that the timing precision of psr  j1738@xmath00333  allows a precise measurement of the key observables necessary for an estimation of the intrinsic orbital decay ( @xmath65 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath298 ) and that the optical observations provide a precise estimate of a general relativistic prediction for the orbital decay , thus allowing a stringent limit on the emission rate for dipolar gws . as a result of this , psr  j1738@xmath00333  is already the most constraining binary pulsar for ( conformally - coupled ) scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "psr  j1738@xmath00333  is also the most constraining test of teves - like theories when the quadratic matter - scalar coupling constant @xmath299 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath300 and @xmath301 , such theories are excluded altogether .",
    "bekenstein s teves ( a special case with @xmath219 ) is still allowed by the results of this experiment , but already needs some tuning given the small limit @xmath302 that we obtain from the double pulsar results @xcite .",
    "we note that the precision of the latter result has greatly improved since 2006 and will be presented in a forthcoming publication ( kramer et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "this will significantly reduce the allowed values of @xmath209 in the gap around @xmath303 . as a consequence",
    ", all surviving teves - like theories will have to be unnaturally fine - tuned , including bekenstein s teves .    continued timing of psr  j1738@xmath00333  will give us a much more precise measurement of @xmath65 and ( to a smaller extent ) of @xmath9 .",
    "this will allow a further improvement of the estimate of the intrinsic orbital decay .",
    "however , unless we can make a more precise determination of @xmath139 , we will not be able to improve upon the current estimate of @xmath114 ; this implies that the precision of this test is unlikely to improve by more than a factor of 2 . despite that",
    ", a precise measurement of @xmath113 is still very useful : together with the measurement of @xmath138 , it will eventually allow ( with the assumption of the correctness of gr ) a very precise estimate of the system masses and a precise calibration of the mass - radius relation for white dwarfs .",
