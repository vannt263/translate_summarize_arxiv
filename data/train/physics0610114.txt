    "the atlas detector @xcite , one of the two general - purpose experiments of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , has entered into the final stages of installation at cern .",
    "the lhc , a proton - proton collider with a 14-tev centre - of - mass energy and a design luminosity of is expected to deliver the first proton beam by the end of 2007 .",
    "the atlas central tracker ( inner detector , i d ) @xcite combines the silicon detector technology ( pixels and micro - strips ) in the innermost part with a straw drift detector with transition radiation detection capabilities ( transition radiation tracker , trt ) in the outside , operating in a 2-t superconducting solenoid .    the microstrip detector ( semiconductor tracker , sct ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : id ] , forms the middle layer of the i d between the pixel detector and the trt .",
    "the sct system @xcite comprises a barrel made of four nested cylinders and two end - caps of nine disks each .",
    "the barrel layers carry 2112 detector units _ ( modules ) _ altogether , while a total of 1976 end - cap modules are mounted on the disks .",
    "the whole sct occupies a cylinder of 5.6  m in length and 56  cm in radius with the innermost layer at a radius of 27  cm .    the silicon modules @xcite consist of one or two pairs of single - sided p-_in_-n microstrip sensors glued back - to - back at a 40-mrad stereo angle to provide two - dimensional track reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 thick sensors @xcite have 768 ac - coupled strips with an @xmath2 pitch for the barrel and a @xmath3 pitch for the end - cap modules . between the sensor pairs",
    "there is a highly thermally conductive baseboard .",
    "barrel modules follow one common design , while for the forward ones four different types exist according to their position in the detector .",
    "the readout of the module is based on 12  abcd3ta asics manufactured in the radiation - hard dmill process mounted on a copper / kapton hybrid @xcite .",
    "the abcd3ta chip @xcite features a 128-channel analog front end consisting of amplifiers and comparators and a digital readout circuit operating at a frequency of 40.08  mhz .",
    "this asic utilises the binary scheme where the signals from the silicon detector are amplified , compared to a threshold and only the result of the comparison enters the input register and a 132-cell deep pipeline , awaiting a level-1 trigger accept signal .",
    "it implements a redundancy mechanism that redirects the output and the control signals , so that a failing chip can be bypassed . to reduce the channel - to - channel threshold variation , in particular after irradiation",
    ", the abcd3ta features an individual threshold correction in each channel with a 4-bit digital - to - analog converter _ ( trimdac ) _ with four selectable ranges .",
    "in addition , a calibration circuitry is implemented in the chip providing an injection charge in the range @xmath4 . by",
    "injecting various known charges and performing threshold scans , the analogue properties of each channel can be determined , such as the gain , the offset and the noise .",
    "the clock and command signals as well as the data are transmitted from and to the off - detector electronics through optical links @xcite .",
    "on the detector side , the doric and vdc are utilised for receiving the optical clock and control signal ( one link ) and for data transmission ( two links ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , three optical fibres are connected to each module , terminated by an opto - package consisting of si _",
    "p - i - n _ diodes and vcsels mounted on the back - of - crate ( boc ) card .",
    "the latter serves as an interface between the optical signals and the off - detector electronics in the read - out driver ( rod ) .",
    "each rod controls and monitors 48  sct modules .",
    "the lhc operating conditions demand challenging electrical performance specifications for the sct modules and the limitations mainly concern acceptable noise occupancy level , tracking efficiency , timing and power consumption .",
    "these requirements reflect on the design of the readout system , as well as on the quality assurance / control strategy followed throughout the detector construction . to this respect ,",
    "a series of electrical tests were performed during the various stages of the detector assembly ; from module production @xcite , to macro - assembly @xcite , at reception at cern @xcite , and eventually after the final integration with trt .",
    "these repetitive tests are necessary to ensure that the module / system performance does not change after each stage , to finalise the corresponding data acquisition software , and to learn how to recover potential errors / problems .",
    "the final stages of the sct assembly and testing at cern were carried out in the atlas sr1 clean - room , equipped with a system capable of characterising up to one million readout channels simultaneously .",
    "electronics tests results such as electrical connections checks , noise and gain measurements , as well as temperature and leakage current measurements were given particular attention .",
    "the outcome of these electronics tests , essential also for the validation of the grounding , shielding and cooling system , are discussed in the following sections .",
    "after the module production , being distributed over several sites in australia , europe , japan and the usa , the macro - assembly took place in three laboratories , in the uk and the netherlands .",
    "the four barrel layers were assembled at the university of oxford employing two specially designed robots for the mounting of modules onto cylindrical support structures .",
    "a detail of a barrel layer showing the overlapping modules is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : detail ] ( left ) .",
    "the on - detector services , being fitted during macro - assembly , include thin - wall cu - ni pipes and module cooling blocks , which remove heat through an evaporative @xmath5 cooling system .",
    "the modules are individually supplied with lv and hv power through al- or cu-_on_-kapton low mass tapes .",
    "the electrical performance of whole barrels was duly tested in oxford for barrels 3 , 4 and  6 and at cern for barrels 3 and  5 .",
    "all digital and analog functions were examined by following standard measuring procedures @xcite .",
    "the tests showed stable operation for a simultaneous readout of up to one million channels in terms of thermal operation , data acquisition and detector control .",
    "more than 99.7% of all barrel channels are fully operational as evident from table  [ tab : barrel ] , where detailed information for dead and noisy channels for each barrel is given .",
    "these figures are in agreement with the ones obtained during module production .",
    "the average module noise was stable at @xmath6 , well below the design specification of @xmath7 .",
    "concerning the detector bias , the leakage current drawn by the sensors at @xmath8 was much lower than @xmath9 at the nominal bias value of 150  v , _",
    "i.e. _  within the specifications .    0.9277|m0.7cm|m1.2cm|m0.65cm|m0.65cm|m0.65cm|m1.8cm|    barrel & total nr .",

    "this operation , completed within a period of three months , was carried out step - by - step with one layer being inserted into the structure each time from the largest down to the smallest one . during this operation ,",
    "the sct services of the _ inner _ layer were transferred onto a horizontal service support structure , whereas the ones of the _ outer _ layer were unfolded radially at the ends .",
    "the two end - caps , on the other hand , were brought together at the university of liverpool ( end - cap  c , _ ec - c _ ) and at nikhef ( end - cap  a , _ ec - a _ ) .",
    "the modules were manually mounted onto disks , fully characterised in a test - box and finally the disks were installed inside carbon fibre cylinders .",
    "a photograph of the fully assembled ec - c as seen from inside is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detail ] ( right ) ; all disks are clearly visible .",
    "both end - caps have been transferred to cern first ec - c and then ec - a and they have passed successfully the reception tests , which include visual inspection , disk alignment measurements , examination of the cooling circuits and comprehensive electronics tests .",
    "the ec - a was tested while cooled down to the nominal temperature of @xmath10 in contrast to ec - c which was tested warm . the measured enc noise for each module of ec - a",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecnoise ] .",
    "these values are comparable to the ones measured during module assembly @xcite and after macro - assembly at nikhef .",
    "the fraction of dead channels was also found to be at the same level as previously measured and around 0.2% .    many of the activities performed on the sct large structures was devoted to connection and manipulation of services , _",
    "i.e. _  the connection of the evaporative cooling plants , the final power supplies and readout electronics",
    ". a prototype of the final data acquisition ( daq ) system , consisted of rods and bocs , and the detector control system ( dcs ) was engaged .",
    "the dcs provides high and low voltage for the sensors and abcd3ta chips , voltage for the doric and vdc asics and monitors the temperature on the modules .",
    "besides monitoring and controlling various parameters of these power supplies , the dcs includes a hard - wired interlock system which automatically switches off the power supply to certain groups of modules in the event of an over - temperature .",
    "in addition , the dcs monitors humidity and temperature sensors mounted on the outlets of each cooling loop and records the corresponding data .",
    "each of the three sct blocks , the barrel and the end - caps , are enfolded in cylindrical structures , the outer and the inner thermal enclosures ( ote and ite , respectively ) .",
    "these foam - based layers , covered by aluminised kapton ( ote ) or carbon - fibre - reinforced - plastic ( ite ) , provide gas tightness , environment at @xmath10 , whereas the trt will be embedded in @xmath11 at a temperature of @xmath12 . ] thermal isolation and faraday shielding .",
    "the gas envelopes are complemented by flat panels fitted on the ends .",
    "a quite large fraction of testing time was given to gas tightness measurements , identification and sealing of leaks .",
    "after several iterations , the leak rate was reduced to an acceptable level for the barrel and ec - c ( ec - a ote has not been fitted yet ) .",
    "the integration and commissioning of the barrel sct with the respective trt @xcite is almost complete .",
    "it started in february  2006 with the insertion of one detector into the other , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sctintotrt ] , using a rail system and a cantilever stand . during this operation ,",
    "the sct services were transferred onto the insertion service support structure ( isss ) , fixed onto the sct cradle extensions .",
    "the trt , installed in the inner detector trolley , was finally slid over the sct .",
    "a series of combined tests followed the integration of the barrel i d , covering a wide spectrum of operational and detector performance related aspects @xcite . during these tests in sr1 ,",
    "one eighth of the trt and one quarter of the sct were equipped with the complete readout chain , in a top - bottom layout as shown in the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmics ] .",
    "as far as the sct is concerned , 468 out of the 2112 modules were read out using 12  rods and one tim . in the trt , on the other hand",
    ", about 10000 channels were examined with nine rods and three ttcs .",
    "three scintillator counters were also installed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cosmics ] , left ) to provide an external trigger from cosmic rays to both detector systems .",
    "a typical cosmic - ray track is shown on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmics ] as reconstructed by a combined sct & trt tracking algorithm .",
    "the measurement results that follow were obtained with this _ cosmic _ setup .",
    "a typical electrical testing sequence begins by establishing communication between the modules and the off - detector electronics system and by optimising the optical links settings .",
    "after the digital tests , _ i.e. _  checking the redundancy links , the chip by - pass functionality and the pipeline circuit , the analogue measurements follow .",
    "these include measurements of the gain , the offset and the noise for each channel and evaluation of the module noise occupancy .",
    "the noise is measured by performing a threshold scan in the absence of charge injection .",
    "the slope of the logarithm of the occupancy versus the square of the threshold is approximately proportional to the enc noise .",
    "furthermore , the noise occupancy at the 1-fc threshold level is obtained , with the exact 1-fc point for each channel already been defined by the trimming .",
    "several distinct configurations were tried in order to assess the potential dependence of the noise on those .",
    "the noise stability was monitored throughout the measurements and only a slight increase was observed for single barrels in comparison with the macro - assembly values , as well as between the whole barrel and the individual barrel layers .",
    "no pick - up noise was detected in the presence of external heaters on the sct thermal enclosure .",
    "after applying temperature corrections , the enc noise was found to be @xmath13 higher for the barrel than after macro - assembly .    for the noise occupancy measurements , the trimdac thresholds for each channel",
    "were initially set to the value obtained during module production , leading however to a wide threshold variation . to remedy this problem the so - called _ new response curve ( rc ) _",
    "configuration was introduced , which included a @xmath14 wafer - by - wafer correction to account for variations in the abcd3ta calibration capacitor .",
    "the latter configuration is compared with the _ old trim target _ uncorrected one in fig .",
    "[ fig : nobarrel ] with respect to the measured noise occupancy . with the new configuration ,",
    "the noise occupancy values are clearly less scattered , returning an r.m.s .",
    "value of @xmath15 , whereas the old one gives an r.m.s .  of @xmath16 .",
    "the observed decrease in the mean value with the rc threshold , on the other hand , is due to the long period of detector bias preceding these measurements , rather than the threshold configuration .",
    "this behaviour had previously been observed in single barrel tests and is evident in calibration as well as physics - mode runs .",
    "the rc configuration was used throughout the cosmic run .",
    "the effect of high trigger frequency was studied by varying the pulser rate in physics mode . for a trigger rate ranging from @xmath17 up to @xmath18 ,",
    "no evidence of increase in noise occupancy was found .",
    "the grounding scheme may be a potential factor contributing to noise level .",
    "therefore the effect of a change in the grounding was studied , by measuring the noise occupancy with the power supply dc shorting cards _ in _ and _ out _ when noth sct and trt are triggered from a pulser at @xmath19 .",
    "no significant change in the noise occupancy was observed , however the grounding scheme in sr1 is not the final one , which will not be available before the detector is installed in its final position .",
    "noise can be evaluated by two methods : online with calibration scans and triggers provided by the rod and tim and offline with physics mode runs triggered by a pulser by applying the offline analysis . with either approach",
    "practically the same results were obtained in terms of noise occupancy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sct ] , a comparison between the enc noise recorded when the sct only is read out ( left panel ) and when the trt is also operated simultaneously ( right panel ) .",
    "the enc noise in both cases remains the same and equal to @xmath20 , thus no electrical pick - up noise is induced between the two detectors .",
    "a similar result is acquired when a different data compression logic than the previously applied _ test mode _",
    "( xxx , excluding 000 ) is selected ; for the _ level mode _ ( x1x ) , the enc noise is 1611  electrons for the sct only and 1610  electrons for sct & trt together .",
    "similar conclusions are drawn for the trt in the absence / presence of the sct readout .    as far as common - mode noise is concerned , no evidence of such was found .",
    "there was no increase in noise occupancy observed when using synchronous triggers .",
    "no correlations have been observed neither between noise hits within chips , nor between hits on different modules .",
    "the i d barrel was transported from sr1 building and installed in the atlas detector in august  2006 . after being lowered into the atlas cavern with only a few millimeters of clearance ,",
    "the detector was successfully inserted in the liquid argon calorimeter cryostat ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : barrel_pit ] ) .",
    "the final stage of the barrel i d commissioning is under way , involving the connection of cables and services , the verification of full connectivity to the power supplies , readout and daq systems , and the on - detector functionality checks of all detector modules for sct and trt .",
    "this intervention will be carried out by implementing the final grounding and shielding scheme for all @xmath21 sct modules and the complete trt .",
    "it should validate the detector for autonomous operation for ten years without further access .",
    "the integration of the forward parts of the i d started in september 2006 with the insertion of the sct ec - c into the trt ec - c , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idc ] . before this operation",
    ", the functionality of an octant of the ec - c was successfully tested inside the thermal enclosures .",
    "the readout and power cables are currently being connected in preparation for the two - month long combined tests in the sr1 clean - room . during those , one quadrant of the sct , _ i.e. _  247 modules , will be read out together with an adjacent sector of the trt corresponding to 1/16 of the total end - cap ( 7680 straws / channels ) .",
    "the i d ec - a , on the other hand , is going to follow more or less the same integration and installation steps as ec - c .",
    "however , this process is expected to proceed faster taking advantage of the experience gained during the ec - c integration .",
    "the i d ec - a is expected to be integrated by november .",
    "both end - caps are scheduled to be ready for installation in the atlas cavern by january ",
    "february  2007 .",
    "atlas sct is progressing well towards integration with the other parts of the i d , installation in atlas and commissioning .",
    "repeated tests in various stages have demonstrated operational stability and good electrical performance .",
    "the fraction of dead channels has been kept below @xmath22 .",
    "particular attention was given to the electronics tests such as electrical connections checks , noise and gain measurements , as well as temperature and leakage current measurements .",
    "the outcome of these tests validated the grounding , shielding and cooling system . as far as noise is concerned , no remarkable change with respect to measurements during module production and macro - assembly has been observed and no pick - up noise has been detected while trt is read out . combined tests with cosmic rays allowed to gain experience with the overall operational and running conditions ( daq , dcs , monitoring , _ etc _ ) .",
    "the barrel i d ( sct & trt ) has been successfully installed in the atlas cavern inside the electromagnetic calorimeter cryostat and the sct end - caps integration with the trt has already started and is well under way .",
    "the innermost layer of the i d , the pixel detector , will be installed independently in 2007 .",
    "the progress reported in this paper represents work performed across the atlas sct collaboration .",
