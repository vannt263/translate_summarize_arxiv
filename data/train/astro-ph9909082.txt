    "weak lensing promises to be one of the most effective ways to study the properties of large scale structure ( lss ) in the next years ( kaiser & squires 1993 ; kaiser 1998 ; van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 1999 ) .",
    "most of the weak lensing methods proposed so far rest heavily on the analysis of background galaxy distorsions ( kaiser 1992 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "1997 , schneider et al .",
    "1997 ) , as they potentially contain finer detail about the lss than the fluctuations of the background number counts , which are affected by intrinsic clustering .",
    "however , detecting and analyzing the typical shear expected from the lss offers technical problems difficult to underestimate ( kaiser , squires & broadhurst 1995 ; bonnet & mellier 1995 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "1997 ; kaiser 1999 ; kuijken 1999 ; although see schneider et al 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , a number of surveys will be available in the near future , as the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) , noao ( januzzi et al .",
    "1999 ) etc . with vast amounts of data which may not be optimal for shear analysis due to the imaging pixel size or typical seeing .",
    "it is therefore necessary to develop methods which are able to tap the wealth of cosmological information contained in such surveys without relying exclusively on image distorsion analysis .",
    "such an approach is provided by the background - foreground correlation function @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the value of this statistic has been calculated by several authors using linear and nonlinear evolution models for the power spectrum evolution ( bartelmann 1995 ; villumsen 1996 ; sanz , martnez - gonzlez & bentez 1997 ; dolag & bartelmann 1997 ; moessner & jain 1998 ; moessner , jain & villumsen 1998 ) . the two most obvious cases in which it is possible to measure @xmath0 are galaxy  galaxy correlations and quasar  galaxy correlations .",
    "the detection of the latter has a long and controversial history ( for a discussion see schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 , bentez 1997 ) , but it seems to be already well established .",
    "however , due to the scarcity of complete , well defined quasar catalogs not affected by observational biases , the results have low signal  to  noise and are difficult to interpret ( bentez , sanz & martnez  gonzlez 1999 ) . the value of the expected amplitude for the low - z galaxy  high - z galaxy cross ",
    "correlation is rather small , and hard to measure within typical single ccd fields ( @xcite ) . only with the advent of deep , multicolor galaxy samples and reliable photometric redshift techniques it has been possible to detect this effect ( herranz et al .",
    "1999 ) .    to interpret the measurements of @xmath0 using the calculations mentioned above ,",
    "it is necessary to assume a certain shape for the power spectrum .",
    "unfortunately it is still far from clear whether the most popular ansatz , that of peacock and dodds ( 1996)or any other for that matter  provides an accurate fit to the lss distribution ( see e.g. jenkins et al .",
    "it is thus desirable to develop methods whose application is not hindered by this uncertainty .",
    "an example is the statistic @xmath8 ( van waerbeke , 1998 ) , which combines shear and number counts information , and can be used to measure the scale dependence of the bias .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is almost independent of the shape of the power spectrum if the foreground galaxy distribution has a narrow redshift range .",
    "here we show that something similar can be achieved with @xmath0 , with the additional advantage of being able to do without the shear information in those cases where the latter is difficult to obtain .",
    "it follows from the magnification bias effect ( canizares 1981 , narayan 1989 , broadhurst , taylor & peacock 1995 ) that the surface number density of background population @xmath9 is changed by the magnification @xmath10 , associated with a foreground galaxy population with number density @xmath11 as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the perturbation in the galaxy surface density @xmath9 ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 is the logarithmic slope of the number counts and in the weak lensing regime @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the convergence , is proportional to the projected matter surface density @xmath20 , it follows that @xmath21 , where @xmath3 is the dark matter surface density perturbation .",
    "therefore @xmath22 and assuming linear and deterministic bias @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the two - point galaxy correlation function for the background populations , and the biasing factor @xmath7 is defined by @xmath25 .",
    "this result provides a straightforward , virtually model independent method to estimate the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "williams & irwin 1998 arrived to a similar expression using a phenomenological approach .",
    "the redshift distorsion method provides the quantity @xmath26 ( dekel 1994 ) , so combining both one can estimate @xmath27 and @xmath7 separately .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "2 we show rigorously that under reasonable assumptions @xmath28 . sec . 3",
    "explores the application of this method to future and ongoing surveys and sec .",
    "4 summarizes our main results and conclusions .",
    "let us consider two populations of sources : a background one ( e.g. quasars or galaxies ) and a foreground one ( e.g. galaxies ) , placed at different distances @xmath29 with p.d.f.s @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . in sanz",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) , the background - foreground correlation @xmath0 was calculated as a functional of the power spectrum @xmath32 of the matter fluctuations at any time ( @xmath29 is the comoving distance from the observer to an object at redshift @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ):    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the bias factor for the foreground galaxies ( assumed to be linear , non - stochastic but possibly redshift and scale dependent ) , @xmath40 is the slope of the background source number counts and @xmath41 is the correlation between the magnification and the mass density fluctuation .",
    "@xmath42 is the lensing window function given by equation ( 7 ) in sanz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : @xmath43 .",
    "the angular two point correlation function for the foreground population @xmath24 can be obtained as    @xmath44\\tau(\\lambda , s\\theta ) , \\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the foreground angular galaxy  galaxy correlation function .",
    "if we assume that the foreground and background galaxies are concentrated at the ` effective ' distances @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( a good approximation for realistic , nonoverlapping redshift distributions , sanz et al .",
    "1997 ) , the previous formulas can be rewritten as @xmath48    @xmath49 \\tau ( { \\lambda}_f , s_f\\theta ) , \\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the critical surface mass distance defined by the angular distance @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the scale factor , and @xmath53 is the width of the p.d.f .",
    "@xmath54 ( e.g. the fwhm for a gaussian distribution ) . dividing eq .",
    "( 5 ) by eq . ( 6 ) and",
    "simplifying one obtains    @xmath55    i.e. the two correlations are proportional .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath56 has the form @xmath57 ( 1-\\lambda_f ) } { [ 1 - ( 1 - \\omega ) \\lambda_f][1 - ( 1 - \\omega ) \\lambda^2_f]^2}\\label{q}\\ ] ]    fig .",
    "1 ( top ) shows the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the @xmath60 case . for the @xmath61 case ,",

    "1 that for @xmath63 and @xmath64 the value of @xmath56 in both open and flat geometries changes very slowly with @xmath58 and almost linearly with @xmath59 . to better understand this behavior from eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) let s assume that @xmath65 . in that case , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 is almost independent of @xmath47 ( fig . 1 ) and",
    "roughly @xmath69  . fig .",
    "2 also shows that for the same redshift range , the amplitude of @xmath56 is also approximately independent of @xmath27 , allowing an empirical , model  independent estimation of @xmath1 .",
    "the main quantity which determines the signal in the measurement of the angular correlation function is the excess ( or defect ) in the expected number of galaxy pairs . for a bin with surface @xmath70 at distance @xmath71",
    "this number will be @xmath72 therefore , the signal  to  noise of the detection will be roughly @xmath73 we have not included the scatter due to the clustering of foreground galaxies and background galaxies , but it is unlikely that this effect will increase the noise over poisson more than a factor of a few for any realistic case .",
    "the quantity @xmath74 is the number of background galaxies per bin .",
    "if we assume radial concentric bins of width @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the signal to noise in each bin will be @xmath77 since @xmath78 is typically @xmath79 , the efficiency of the method will decrease very slowly with radius , allowing to map @xmath1 up to very large scales .",
    "the sdss will obtain @xmath80 spectra for a population of @xmath81 galaxies ( @xcite ) , forming a splendid foreground sample .",
    "it may be assumed that its projected angular correlation function will be similar to that of the apm catalog , which has an amplitude @xmath82 at @xmath83 and a slope @xmath84 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sdss will also obtain @xmath85 @xmath86 photometry for @xmath87 galaxies in a @xmath88 degree region , for which photometric redshifts will be estimated .",
    "the background sample can be formed by those galaxies with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "the value of @xmath56 can not be considered constant for these two samples ( see fig .",
    "1 ) because of the range of redshifts involved . luckily , the existence of spectroscopic redshifts for the foreground sample will allow to select subsamples with an extremely thin redshift distribution for which @xmath56 is approximately constant , each yielding independent estimates of @xmath1 which can afterwards be combined together . a rough estimate of the expected result using eq .",
    "( 12 ) gives @xmath92 ( we have assumed @xmath93 ) this shows that it will be possible to map @xmath1 with an extremely good combination of resolution and accuracy using the sdss . at large radii",
    ", the bias factor is expected to become constant ( @xcite ) , which means that the bin size can be made as large as desired without being affected by the scale dependence of @xmath7 and therefore substantially decrease the error in the estimation of @xmath1 .",
    "it is obvious from the above numbers that the main source of errors will not be the shot noise , but contamination due to low redshift galaxies which may sneak into the high  redshift sample creating a spurious correlation .",
    "this contamination can be very effectively minimized by applying a bayesian threshold ( bentez 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , it will be possible to accurately quantify and correct this effect using a calibration sample with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the sdss also plans to obtain spectra for a sample of @xmath94 red luminous galaxies with @xmath95 and @xmath94 qsos . due to the much lower density of the background sample",
    ", it will not be possible to attain such a good spatial resolution in the measurement of @xmath1 , but these samples will allow to trace the evolution of biasing with redshift up to @xmath96 .",
    "however , experience shows that in this case the utmost attention will have to be paid to eliminating or accounting for the observational biases in the qso detection and identification procedure , which can totally distort the estimation of @xmath97 ( ferreras , bentez & martnez - gonzlez 1997 , bentez , sanz & martnez - gonzlez 1999 ) .",
    "a correlation ( positive or negative ) between the surface density of foreground galaxies tracing the large scale structure and the position of background galaxies and quasars is expected from the magnification bias effect ( canizares 1981 ) .",
    "we show that this foreground ",
    "background correlation function @xmath0 can be used as a straightforward and almost model - free method to measure the cosmological ratio @xmath1 .    for samples with appropriate redshift distributions , @xmath98 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the foreground dark matter and galaxy surface density fluctuations .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the foreground galaxy angular two - point correlation function , @xmath7 is the biasing factor , and the proportionality factor is independent of the dark matter power spectrum .",
    "simple estimations show that the application of this method to the galaxy and quasar samples generated by the upcoming sloan sky digital survey will achieve a highly accurate and well resolved measurement of the ratio @xmath1 .",
