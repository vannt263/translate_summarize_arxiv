    "<S> the rich variety of iron - based superconductors and their complex electronic structure lead to a wide range of possibilities for gap symmetry and pairing components . here </S>",
    "<S> we solve in the 2-fe brillouin zone the full frequency - dependent linearized eliashberg equations for lifeas with spin - fluctuation mediated pairing interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic excitations are calculated with the random phase approximation on a correlated electronic structure obtained with density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> correlations induce long - lived local moments with orbital - dependent dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between electrons through hund s coupling promotes inter - orbital magnetic susceptibility . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the leading pairing channel , conventional @xmath0 , acquires sizeable inter - orbital @xmath1 singlet pairing with odd parity under glide - plane symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> these components reduce the superconducting gap magnitude induced by the intra - orbital components of the gap function at the electron pockets intersection where the fe - d @xmath2 orbitals strongly mix . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn makes the results consistent with available experiments on the angular dependence of the gaps observed on the different fermi surfaces .    </S>",
    "<S> lifeas is a stoichiometric superconductor with superconducting @xmath3  k and no magnetic ordering .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite despite rather poor nesting  @xcite , recent quasiparticle interference experiments identify the antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin - fluctuation mediated mechanism as the predominant pairing interaction .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite experimental evidence also supports the existence of long - lived magnetic moments in lifeas .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite arpes and quasiparticle - scattering interference measurements below @xmath4 show that the superconducting ( sc ) gaps of lifeas are nodeless , with a fermi surface ( fs ) dependence and a sizable variation along each fs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite polarized neutron diffraction as a function of temperature has shown a suppression of the local spin susceptibility in the sc phase , suggesting singlet pairing .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in theoretical studies , the af spin - fluctuation mediated pairing  @xcite and a combination of af spin - fluctuation and orbital fluctuation mediated by phonons have been investigated .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , all studies are performed in the one - iron unit cell with various unfolding algorithms used to embed the correct symmetry .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this procedure is exact only for a strictly two - dimensional electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the sc gap equation is usually projected on the fs , the pairing interaction is symmetrized ,  @xcite and the resulting equation is always solved in the bcs approximation . </S>",
    "<S> all of the above simplifications must be questioned before we can be confident of the results . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for fe - based superconductors ( fescs ) with a non - symmorphic point - group ,  @xcite anti - symmetry of fermions does not place a constraint on the parity of the sc pairing channel .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this allows for odd parity spin singlet pairing when there is orbital weight at the fermi level from orbitals with different in - plane mirror reflection symmetry .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    hence , here we revisit spin - fluctuation mediated pairing by considering both fe-@xmath5 and as-@xmath6 orbitals in the two - fe unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of correlations on the electronic structure of iron based superconductors has been recognized before  @xcite so we work in the lda+dmft framework .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we solve the linearized eliashberg equations  @xcite in the two - fe brillouin zone ( bz ) to investigate sc pairing and gap symmetry . since there is increasing evidence that superconductivity does not emerge as a fs instability  @xcite , we work in the orbital representation instead of projecting the gap equation on the fss . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that in the leading channel , with the conventional @xmath0 symmetry , odd parity inter - orbital pairing accompanies the usual intra - orbital pairing and increases with interactions , in particular with hund s coupling . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous studies  @xcite we find that this state can reproduce the angular dependence of the gap on the electron pockets .    </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath2 orbitals have a relatively narrower bandwidth , so they are more strongly correlated .  @xcite the orbital dependence of the correlation effects is apparent in the mass enhancements @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 orbitals , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 orbital has the strongest mass enhancement and shortest quasi - particle lifetime .    </S>",
    "<S> the fs of lifeas consists of three hole - like and two electron - like sheets around the center and corners of the bz respectively . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] illustrates the lda+dmft partial spectral weight , @xmath17 , of fe @xmath2- orbitals on the fss . </S>",
    "<S> the two inner hole pockets are predominantly composed from @xmath18 and @xmath19 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest hole pocket crosses the fermi level only in close vicinity to the @xmath20 point . </S>",
    "<S> it hybridizes with the @xmath10 orbital near @xmath21 point and is closed there , while remaining @xmath22 away from this point . </S>",
