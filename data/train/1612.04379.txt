    "in one way or another , almost all of our understanding of exoplanets relies upon stellar modeling . aside from a few notable exceptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , exoplanet observations largely rely on seeing changes in the host stars themselves , whether that is via acceleration , dimming , or movement on the sky .",
    "since this gives us only a relative mass or a relative radius , our estimates of the planetary properties are inextricably linked to our knowledge of the host stars themselves .",
    "lacking observations of the stellar radius or mass , through interferometry or other means , it nevertheless has been possible to infer model - independent ( or nearly independent ) stellar radii via two methods .",
    "first , it is possible to estimate the radius of the primary stars in short - period eclipsing binaries by assuming tidal synchronization : then the primary s circumference is given by the orbital period of the binary divided by the spectroscopically measured @xmath6 of the primary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , one can estimate the bolometric luminosity of a planetary host star by fitting model stellar atmospheres , chosen using a spectroscopic effective temperature , to catalog magnitudes and a measured stellar parallax . though this method relies upon stellar model atmospheres to transform the apparent flux at earth into an overall bolometric luminosity ,",
    "this transformation is relatively well understood , having been the basis of modern astronomy for the last 150 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a thus derived parallatic radius estimate is therefore essentially model - independent , and can be used in determining the other system parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in systems with transiting exoplanets , where the planet - to - star mass ratio is small",
    ", it is also generically possible to accurately measure the density of the central star using only the transit photometry itself @xcite .",
    "coupled with the stellar radii inferred above , one can then make an estimate of the stellar mass .",
    "this then provides us with a complete set of physical parameters for the star and planet that rely on models only insofar as what is used in estimating the bolometric luminosity from the observed catalog magnitudes .",
    "recently , @xcite used this technique , together with the parallax measurements in the first gaia data release @xcite and the previously published transit properties of over one hundred transiting exoplanets , to estimate the masses and radii of the host stars and the planets in these systems . while the precision of these first gaia measurements limited @xcite s ability to measure masses and radii to better than 20% to 30%",
    ", they note that using gaia s final data release it should be possible to make similar estimates good to 5% to 7% .    until the very recent release of the first gaia parallaxes , the faintness limit of @xmath7 in the hipparcos data set meant that this type of analysis was impossible for the majority of transiting exoplanets , and it has not been a routine practice in characterizing discoveries . most of the large ground - based ( superwasp , hatnet ) and space - based ( kepler ) surveys typically find planets around stars with magnitudes of @xmath8 that are too faint to have hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "thus , all of the characterization of all of these systems has relied on estimating the parameters of the host stars using stellar models .",
    "the kelt transit survey , which generally targets brighter , @xmath9 , stars , is an exception to this rule .",
    "four of the planets discovered by kelt ( kelt-2ab @xcite , kelt-4b @xcite , kelt-7b @xcite , and kelt-11b @xcite ) are bright enough to possess hipparcos parallaxes . in the cases of kelt-2ab and kelt-11b , the fractional uncertainties on the measured parallaxes were low enough that modeling the stellar bolomtric flux at earth via the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the host star provided meaningful stellar radius constraints , which were inserted as bayesian priors on the stellar radius during the fitting process .    in the case of kelt-11b (",
    "* hereafter also  the discovery paper  ) , the availability of the hipparcos parallax not only provided a constraint on the stellar radius , it also resolved a major degeneracy in fitting for the system s parameters .",
    "specifically , the best ground - based observations using the kelt follow - up network had difficulty differentiating between models with a shallow , 2.5 mmag , transit , and models with a deep , 4.5 mmag transit .",
    "kelt-11 ( hd 93396 ) is an evolved sub - giant , with @xmath10k and @xmath11(cgs ) @xcite .",
    "coincidentally , it has been spectroscopically observed since 2007 by the `` retired a stars '' program @xcite to search for radial velocity planetary companions . due to",
    "kelt-11 s relatively large stellar radius ( @xmath12 ) , a transit of kelt-11b takes almost six hours .",
    "this meant that during the follow - up observing campaign to more precisely characterize the system , a complete transit was extremely difficult to observe from the ground , and it was impossible to observe a complete transit plus anything more than a brief out - of - transit baseline using a single ground - based observatory .",
    "a multi - site network could have stitched together a complete transit with good baseline coverage , but this would have been problematic due to another effect of kelt-11 s large stellar radius : kelt-11b s relatively small transit depth .",
    "this made partial transits collected in a multi - site campaign difficult to interpret , as the corrections for airmass effects could remove some or all of the transit signal .",
    "luckily , the stellar radius implied by the hipparcos parallax allowed the discovery paper to differentiate between these two cases , as the 4.5 mmag fit predicted a stellar radius @xmath13 larger than the parallactic radius , while the 2.5 mmag fit agreed almost perfectly .    in an effort to observe a precise and complete transit of kelt-11b , we observed the system using the spitzer space telescope .",
    "first and foremost , we wished to verify the measurements of the system parameters made by @xcite , and to refine them using the spitzer photometry .",
    "secondly , we wished to consider how accurately and precisely we can determine stellar masses and radii , and in turn the planet masses and radii , in what is essentially an entirely empirical fashion .",
    "that process involves the combination of high - precision photometric transit observations - here with spitzer , but in the future with tess - that are fit simultaneously with radial velocity data , sed data , and a precise parallax .",
    "we observed a single transit of kelt-11b at 3.6@xmath0 m  using the irac camera on the spitzer space telescope , using just under 15 hours of observing time .",
    "we divided our observations into two sections : the first was an initial 0.5 hour `` settling '' period to allow the initial ramp - up in the detector to occur , followed by slightly more than 14 hours of science observations .",
    "we did not use the 30 minute settling data in our analysis . to stabilize the spacecraft s pointing we used the pcrs peak - up mode with kelt-11 as the peak - up target , and we used the @xmath14 pixel subarray read mode to decrease the image read - out time .",
    "the science observations ran from ut 2016 april 4 1852 to ut 2016 april 5 0948 . due to the brightness of the star kelt-11",
    "( @xmath15 ) , we took extremely short 0.1 second exposures to prevent the detector from saturating .",
    "this gave us a total of 409,792 images .",
    "we used the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images for all of our data reduction and analysis .",
    "each bcd data cube contains 64 images , and records the @xmath16  time of the beginning of the exposure sequence ( mbjd_obs ) and the 64 image sequence duration ( aintbeg and atimeend ) .",
    "we calculated the @xmath16  mid - point of each exposure by assuming that the first exposure was taken at mbjd_obs and that all 64 exposures were evenly spaced in time between aintbeg and atimeend .",
    "we converted the resulting @xmath16  mid - exposure times to @xmath17  by adding 68.134 seconds .",
    "we began our data reduction by background - subtracting each of our images .",
    "to do so , we masked out the central area of each image , within 15 pixels of the image center , and used this outer portion of each image to estimate that image s background .",
    "we performed three rounds of @xmath18 clipping to remove any outliers , and then fit a gaussian to a histogram of the remaining pixels values .",
    "we used the mean of this gaussian fit as the mean background for each image , which we then subtracted .",
    "the average background flux was 0.015% of kelt-11 s average flux level .",
    "0.00 in   -0.1 in    to help remove the well known intra - pixel affects in spitzer / irac photometry , and to center our photometric extraction apertures , we measured the stellar position in each image .",
    "we did so by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian to the stellar point - spread function ( psf ) using the entire background - subtracted image . to prevent possible cosmic ray hits or other hot pixel events from generating spurious centroid shifts , we replaced any hot pixels in an image by that pixel s median flux within the image in question s 64 image data cube . to determine",
    "if a particular pixel within a particular image was `` hot '' , we took each pixel s time series within a 64 image cube and flagged any images with greater than @xmath19 outliers .",
    "note that we only conducted this hot pixel replacement for the images we used to determine the stellar centroid  for our aperture photometry we used the uncorrected background - subtracted images .",
    "a visual inspection of our initially extracted photometry showed that the beginning of the background - subtracted light curve still contained a noticeable ramp affect .",
    "we therefore removed the first 10,000 images , covering the first 16 minutes , from our analysis .",
    "we additionally performed a single pass of @xmath20 clipping on our raw photometry , which removed an additional 67 observations .",
    "the trimming and clipping process left us with 399,725 data points with which to perform our analysis ( figure [ rawphot ] ) .",
    "the median photon noise error on these data was 4435ppm .      to extract a light curve from our 3.6@xmath0 m  images , we performed simple aperture photometry on the background - subtracted images .",
    "we used the stellar centroids , as determined above , to center our extraction apertures , and we used a variable aperture size that scaled with the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the stellar psf .",
    "0.00 in   -0.0 in    we set our photometric extraction aperture to scale with the noise pixel parameter , which is defined in section 2.2.2 of the irac instrument handbook as @xmath21 the stellar fwhm is equivalent to @xmath22 .",
    "to calculate the noise pixel parameter for our observations , we summed the pixels within a three pixel box of kelt-11 s position  accounting for partial pixels .",
    "s average fwhm over our observations was 2.14 pixels , with a standard deviation of 0.03 pixels .",
    "we set our extraction aperture to be equal to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is some constant .",
    "to determine the optimal value for @xmath24 , we extracted light curves using trial values of @xmath24 from -0.5 to 2.0 , in steps of 0.1 .",
    "we then fit each of these light curves using the initial nelder - mead likelihood maximization stage of our fitting process , which we describe in section 3 . below .",
    "we choose @xmath25 as the optimal value , as this aperture created the light curve with the highest fit likelihood , and the lowest standard deviation in the residuals to the fit ( figure [ apervary ] ) . as a check to see how strongly the choice of aperture size influences our results , we examined how the fit values of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 varied as a function of @xmath24 ( right panel of figure [ apervary ] ) . aside from low values of @xmath24",
    " which presumably are apertures not encapsulating all of the light from kelt-11  we found that the fit values of all three of these parameters did not vary significantly relative to our final @xmath5 uncertainties ( blue shaded regions in figure [ apervary ] ) .",
    "alongside our 3.6@xmath0 m  spitzer photometry , we simultaneously fit a subset of the ground - based transit light curves used in the discovery paper , the radial velocity ( rv ) observations from the discovery paper , and a spectral energy distribution model for the star kelt-11 .",
    "we discuss our selection of ground - based light curves at the end of section 3.1.3 .",
    "we combined all of these into one likelihood function , which we conceptually split into five parts : @xmath29    we conducted the fitting process in two stages .",
    "first , we performed an initial nelder - mead maximization of our likelihood function to identify a starting best fit value for our model parameters . to account for the effect of unaccounted for red noise in our observations , for each of our light curves and rv data sets we scaled the median uncertainties in each individual data set to match the root mean square ( rms ) standard deviation of each data set s residuals to the initial best fit . in all cases",
    "this scaling increased the median uncertainty : by a factor of 1.4 for the spitzer observations , factors of two to ten for the ground - based photometry , and approximately a factor of two for the rv observations .",
    "we then used the python emcee package @xcite to perform an mcmc exploration of the parameter space surrounding the initial best fit , to determine parameter uncertainties and to verify that we had identified the global maximum likelihood value .",
    "we initialized a set of 80 walkers in parameter space around the initial best fit location , and ran each for an initial 1,000 step burn - in , before running a 10,000 step production run . at the end of the 10,000 step production run",
    ", we calculated the gelman - rubin statistic for each of our model parameters , and judged the mcmc chains to have converged if the gelman - rubin statistic was below 1.1 .      for both the spitzer and ground - based photometry we used non - parametric gaussian process ( gp ) regression models to fit our transits of kelt-11 using the george python package @xcite .",
    "our raw spitzer photometry displayed the usual kind of correlation for these sorts of observations : flux variation as a function of stellar centroid position , on top of a background temporal trend ( figure [ rawphot ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the long duration of kelt-11b s transit means that all but one of the ground - based light curves used in the discovery paper were not able to observe a complete transit event .",
    "the long transit duration also meant that the one discovery light curve that was able to capture both the ingress and egress did so at high airmass ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "as noted in the discovery paper , this means that the discovery photometry displays strong trends with respect to airmass and time .",
    "we chose to account for the presence of these strong correlations in our spitzer and ground - based photometry by modeling both using a gp regression .",
    "this type of regression method models the observed data as probabilistic draws from a multivariate gaussian distribution , rather than using a univariate gaussian as would be done in a typical @xmath31 regression .",
    "this has the advantage that we may attempt to account for multi - variable correlations due to time , airmass , or stellar position directly using the multivariate gaussian s covariance matrix , rather than projecting the airmass or stellar position correlations onto the time axis using what can be arbitrary detrending functions .",
    "@xcite gives a much more detailed mathematical description of gps , and @xcite provides one of the first discussions of gps in the context of astronomical photometric observations .",
    "gp analyses have been used before on spitzer data by @xcite and @xcite , and on ground - based exoplanet observations by @xcite .    to define the multivariate gaussian underlying our gp model",
    ", we used a mean function , and a covariance kernel used to generate the covariance matrix .",
    "the mean function , @xmath32 , was the astrophysical transit model for the kelt-11 system .",
    "we used two different covariance kernels ",
    "@xmath33  for the spitzer observations , and the ground - based observations .",
    "for the transit model @xmath32 we used a @xcite transit model as implemented by the batman python package @xcite .",
    "our transit model depended upon the time , @xmath34 , of the observations , and upon a set of physical parameters , @xmath35 , which were the same for the spitzer and ground - based observations .",
    "specifically , we fit for @xmath36 these seven parameters are the predicted time of transit ( @xmath37 ) , the orbital period ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the cosine of the orbital inclination ( @xmath41 ) , the radius of the planet in stellar radii ( @xmath42 ) , the semi - major axis in units of the stellar radii ( @xmath43 $ ] ) . though we median normalized our photometry , we did not explicitly fit for a baseline flux level , as this is implicitly included in the gp fitting process .",
    "based on the lack of measured transit timing variations in the discovery paper , we also did not allow for them in our analysis .",
    "note too that all of these parameters , except for @xmath42 , were also used in either or rv or sed fitting , though we find that in practice the photometry largely sets most of them except for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    so that we might compare the results of the spitzer observations to those of the discovery paper",
    ", we did not impose any priors on any of the transit model parameters .",
    "we did use the discovery paper values as the starting location for our initial nelder - mead likelihood maximization .      as shown in figure",
    "[ rawphot ] , our raw spitzer photometry displayed correlations with stellar centroid position and time that are typical for 3.6@xmath0 m  photometry .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we chose to model these correlations by constructing a gp covariance kernel that was a combination of temporal and positional covariances .",
    "specifically , we used an additive kernel @xmath44 we used the `` @xmath45 '' suffix in the subscripts to denote fitting variables that related to the spitzer data .",
    "for the positional kernel we multiplicatively combined squared exponential functions for the x- and y - position of the stellar centroid to generate the covariance between the @xmath46th and @xmath47th observations as @xmath48 ^ 2-\\left[\\frac{y_i - y_j}{l_{ys}}\\right]^2\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are the hyperparameters setting the the overall amplitude ( @xmath50 ) , and the covariance length scales in x- and y - position ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "the multiplication ensured that the gp model would only treat points as correlated if they were close to each other in both dimensions .",
    "for the temporal covariance kernel we used a matern-3/2 to estimate the covariance between the @xmath46th and @xmath47th observations : @xmath53 the hyperparameters here , @xmath54 , are the overall amplitude @xmath55 and the covariance length scale in time , @xmath56 .",
    "the likelihood of our spitzer gp model was then simply the likelihood of the multivariate gaussian function defined by @xmath57 and the mean function @xmath32 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the vector of the residuals of our observed data ( @xmath60 ) from our transit model defined in section 3.1.1 , and @xmath61 is the number of observations .",
    "the major difference between our gp model for the spitzer observations and those used by @xcite and @xcite was this number , @xmath61 , of data points used in the analysis .",
    "the matrix inversion required to compute the likelihood in equation ( [ eq:31230 ] ) was computationally impossible for our full spitzer dataset , since @xmath62 was a @xmath63 matrix .",
    "the problem of creating gp models for large datasets is a topic that has been extensively covered in the machine learning literature . for our spitzer data",
    ", we used a product of experts ( poe ) model , as described by @xcite .",
    "a poe model evenly splits the dataset into a set of @xmath64 `` experts , '' such that the computations necessary to calculate the likelihood of each expert s data with respect to the model is practical . in our case",
    ", we divided our dataset into @xmath65 experts , each with approximately 1,000 data points .",
    "the likelihood of the poe model was then the simple sum of each expert s individual likelihood , @xmath66 the poe model has the virtue of being one of the simplest treatments of large datasets in the gp framework . as shown in @xcite",
    ", a poe model will successfully recover the same predicted mean and uncertainty on the mean as a full gp model within the observed data range . within the machine learning community",
    ", this has limited the appeal of poe models , since they are typically interested in using gp techniques to predict trends away from the observed data . for astronomical purposes",
    ", however , we are only concerned with the behavior of the mean  the transit model  where we have observations , and a poe model is therefore well suited to dealing with large astronomical datasets .    in our fitting",
    "we do not impose any priors on the spitzer hyperparameters , other than requiring that the covariance length scale in time , @xmath67 , be longer than the predicted ingress and egress times of kelt-11b s transit .",
    "this ensures that the gp regression model does not treat the transit itself as correlated noise .      for the ground - based observations we used a gp regression model based upon covariances as a function of time and airmass .",
    "we used a squared exponential covariance kernel for both , and additively combined them as @xmath68 we calculated the airmass covariance between the @xmath46th and @xmath47th observations as @xmath69 ^ 2\\right),\\ ] ] where the hyperparameters @xmath70 are the overall amplitude @xmath71 and the covariance length scale with respect to airmass , @xmath72 .",
    "we used a `` @xmath73 '' suffix to denote fitting variables relating to the ground - based light curves .",
    "we calculated the temporal covariances as @xmath74 ^ 2\\right),\\ ] ] where we again used an amplitude and length scale hyperparameter set , @xmath75 .",
    "we used four of the ground - based light curves from the discovery paper in our fitting process : the light curve from westminster college observatory ( wco ) observed on ut 2015 january 01 , the light curve from the perth exoplanet survey telescope ( pest ) from ut 2015 march 08 , the light curve from the las cumbres observatory global telescope location in sutherland , south africa ( cpt ) on ut 2015 may 04 , and the light curve observed with the manner - vanderbilt ritchey chretien ( mvrc ) telescope on ut 2016 february 22 .",
    "we selected these four light curves based on the appearance of their raw , undetrended photometry .",
    "each of them appeared to show some of the cleanest observations of the ingress and egress of kelt-11b s transit .",
    "the one exception is the mvrc light curve , which does not show an obvious transit signature , but we included because it is the only ground - based light curve in the discovery paper that saw a complete transit .    for each of the four light curves we used individual sets of gp hyperparameters ( table [ tab : hyperparameters ] ) , giving us 16 hyperparameters for our ground - based fitting . in practice",
    ", we found that the fits to each light curve s hyperparameters did not vary substantially .",
    "the likelihood function we used for the ground - based gp modeling was the same as for the spitzer data : @xmath76 where we summed each of the @xmath46 ground - based light curves used in our fitting process .",
    "similar to with the spitzer data , we do not impose any prior on the ground - based hyperparameters , other then forcing @xmath77 to be longer than the ingress and egress times of the transit .",
    "we used the rv measurements presented in the discovery paper for our fitting , which are one set of observations from keck using the high resolution echelle spectrometer , and another set of observations from the automated planet finder ( apf ) using the levy spectrograph . since kelt-11 has been coincidentally observed as a part of the `` retired a stars '' program , the 17 keck rvs span eight years , while the 15 apf rvs were observed between 2015 january 12 and 2015 november 4 .",
    "the observing set - ups and the reduction process for both these datasets are described in more detail in the discovery paper . here , we specifically use the reduced rv measurements listed in table 16 of the discovery paper .",
    "0.00 in   -0.0 in    we fit the rv data using a single keplerian orbit allowing for non - zero eccentricity and a background linear velocity slope .",
    "the two datasets shared the same physical parameters , but each was assigned a separate systemic velocity offset , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "all together , our rv model @xmath80 used 10 parameters : @xmath81 in addition to the physical parameters already defined in section 3.1.1 for our transit model , the rv model also included the planet - to - star mass ratio ( @xmath82 ) , the systemic velocities for each dataset ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) , and a linear velocity slope ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we did not fit directly for the velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath84 , of the rv orbit , but rather computed it as @xmath85 where @xmath86 this allowed us to incorporate the observational constraints on @xmath46 and @xmath87 from the transit fits , and the constraint on @xmath88 provided by the sed fit directly into our model of the rv orbit .",
    "similar to our transit model , we do not impose any priors on the the elements of @xmath89 , other than using the discovery paper values as the starting point for our initial nelder - mead likelihood maximization .",
    "we calculated the likelihood of a given rv model as @xmath90,\\ ] ] over all of our @xmath46 rv observations .",
    "in addition to the photometric and rv datasets for kelt-11 , we used the catalog magnitudes for the system to simultaneously fit an sed model to the stellar emission . in conjunction with the hipparcos parallax for the system ,",
    "this allowed us to determine a stellar radius for the star kelt-11 that was mostly model - independent .",
    "we used the galex , tycho , 2mass , and wise magnitudes listed in table [ tab : seddata ] for our sed fits . to account for systematic uncertainties present in the longer wavelength wise photometry , we increased the uncertainties on the galex nuv , the w3 and the w4 magnitudes from their published values of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , to @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath94 , respectively @xcite .",

    "similarly , we imposed a gaussian prior on the parallax to kelt-11 using the hipparocs parallax of @xmath103mas .",
    "though kelt-11 is included in the initial gaia source catalog , its parallax was not published as a part of the gaia dr1 results . for the amount of visual extinction , @xmath98 , to kelt-11",

    "since the castelli - kurucz models step by 250k in @xmath100 , 0.5 dex in @xmath101 , and 0.1 dex in @xmath102}}$ ] , we used a cubic spline interpolation to estimate model magnitudes in between the points provided by the castelli - kurucz atmospheres .",
    "we then scaled these interpolated surface magnitudes by @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the distance to the star , to determine the apparent bolometric flux of the models at earth .",
    "we then applied a simple @xmath108 extinction law scaled from the value of @xmath98 , to determine the extincted bolometric flux of the sed model .",
    "similar to the rv data , we computed the likelihood of our sed model as @xmath109,\\ ] ] over all of our @xmath46 catalog apparent magnitudes .",
    "we fit for kelt-11 s system parameters in four different ways .",
    "first , we simultaneously fit the spitzer photometry , the rv data , and the sed model .",
    "second , we performed a fit using both the spitzer and the ground - based photometry , together with the rv and sed data .",
    "third , we conducted a fit to the spitzer , ground - based , rv , and sed data but also imposed a prior on the kelt-11 s mass and radius using the torres relations @xcite for stellar mass and radius as a function of effective temperature , gravity , and metallicity .",
    "fourth and finally , we did a fit to the spitzer , ground - based , rv , and sed data , but lowered the uncertainty on the hipparcos parallax for kelt-11 to match what is expected to be the parallax precision of the final gaia data release .",
    "the results of all four fits are listed in tables [ tab : posteriors1 ] , [ tab : posteriors2 ] , and [ tab : hyperparameters ] .",
    "we adopted the fit using the torres relations as the true set of system parameters . as we discuss below , the measured hipparcos parallax drives the spitzer and spitzer plus ground fits to unrealistically high stellar radii , based on our expectations from stellar models and observations .",
    "though the relatively large uncertainties on these two fits without the torres relations mean that the difference is not statistically significant , the median parameter values do change slightly .    in terms of the photometric transit , we find that the spitzer photometry strongly influences the fit results even when the ground - based data is included .",
    "considering figure [ photometry ] , which shows both the spitzer and ground - based photometry binned into ten minute intervals , this result is not entirely surprising given the relatively high precision of the spitzer data .",
    "in all of our fitting scenarios we find that the transit is slightly shallower and shorter than in the discovery paper .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath110 , which is @xmath111 smaller than the discovery paper value of @xmath112 , and we find values for @xmath113 and @xmath87 that are both slightly more than @xmath114 higher than their discovery paper values .",
    "this considerably shortens the transit duration , by approximately 98 minutes or @xmath115 .",
    "we also find that the transit center occurs 6.4 minutes , or @xmath116 later than predicted by the discovery ephemeris .    given the nature of the photometry in the discovery paper ,",
    "these changes in the system parameters using the complete spitzer transit are not unexpected .",
    "rather , this nicely illustrates the difficulty inherent in measuring the properties of a transiting planet using only light curves with partial transits . without both a pre- and post - transit baseline to provide a robust flux reference , the time and airmass detrending necessary for precise ground - based measurements can easily alter the apparent depth of the event .",
    "similarly , observing the ingress and egress on separate nights , often different by tens of orbital periods , introduces the danger that transparency variations can masquerade as ingress or egress signals , and means that any uncertainty in the orbital period is highly covariant with the apparent transit duration .",
    "one interesting difference between the fitting cases occurs when we impose a prior on the stellar mass and radius based on the torres relations .",
    "these relations predict the mass and radius based on the stellar effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity . compared to the fit using only the spitzer and ground - based photometry ,",
    "the fit using the torres relations finds lower mean values for the stellar radius and mass ( by approximately @xmath117@xmath4and @xmath118@xmath3 , or 1@xmath119 and 1.9@xmath119 , respectively ) , and a higher value for the implied stellar parallax ( by 1mas , or 1.25@xmath119 ) .",
    "figure [ density ] demonstrates why this is so . using the geneva stellar models @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the mass of kelt-11 using the effective temperature measured via spectroscopy and the stellar density measured via the transit observables .",
    "based on these measurements , the geneva models predict kelt-11 s mass as @xmath120@xmath3 , which is similar to the torres mass determination of @xmath121@xmath3 . since the density of kelt-11 is determined by the transit observables , the lower mass estimate from using the stellar models leads to a lower radius estimate , and hence forces the sed fitting process to a larger implied parallax for kelt-11 .",
    "0.00 in   -0.1 in    that being said , the tension between the fits with and without the torres relations is relatively weak : on the order of @xmath5 for all of the parameters of interest .",
    "this is almost entirely due to the 9% fractional uncertainty on the hipparcos parallax for kelt-11 , which without the torres relations leads directly to a 10% fractional uncertainty on the stellar radius and a 16% fractional uncertainty on the stellar mass . put another way , the implied parallax necessary for the sed fits to agree with the mass and radius desired by the stellar models is not significantly different from the measured hipparcos parallax , with @xmath122mas .",
    "nevertheless , based on our fitting we would expect that the gaia parallax for kelt-11 should be approximately 10.7mas , rather than the hipparcos value of 9.76mas .      to investigate how this situation would change presuming a smaller uncertainty on the measured parallax",
    ", we conducted a fit to the spitzer and ground - based data  without the torres relations  but used a hypothetical parallax measurement of @xmath123mas .",
    "this is the precision we expect for kelt-11 in the final gaia data release @xcite . as shown in the rightmost column of table [ tab : posteriors2 ] , this leads to much smaller uncertainties in mass ( by a factor of 2.5 ) and radius ( by a factor of 10 ) for the star kelt-11 . in this hypothetical scenario ,",
    "the tension between the mass and radius from the stellar models , and those from the observations , becomes much more acute , differing by @xmath18 in mass and @xmath18 in radius .    while purely notional , this illustrates the possibilities afforded by combining rv measurements , catalog magnitudes , precise photometry , and gaia parallaxes into simultaneous fits to systems with transiting planets and eclipsing binaries .",
    "this combination will allow us to make stellar mass and radius estimations that , aside from the spectra used in the sed modeling , are largely independent of stellar models .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this idea has been recently suggested both in the kelt-11 discovery paper @xcite , and more generally by @xcite .",
    "the difference between our results and those previous analyses is that we integrate the sed fitting process into our determination of the system parameters , which allows us to directly include the effects of parameter covariances in our final uncertainties , rather than assuming the covariance with the sed terms are zero @xcite , or using average estimated values @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our mass estimate for kelt-11 without using stellar models ( rightmost column of table [ tab : posteriors1 ] ) is approximately a factor of two more precise than a similar model - less mass estimate from the discovery paper .",
    "this is entirely a result of our precise spitzer photometry , which allow us to make a considerably improved measurement of @xmath87 , and hence the stellar density , from the photometric transit .",
    "0.00 in   -0.1 in    in the future , even more precise results should be possible by combining the final gaia parallaxes , and the precise photometry that will be available from the tess mission .",
    "if we presume that most of the tess targets fall in the bright , systematics - limited , regime for gaia parallaxes , then it should be possible to measure their stellar radii to approximately 3% ( i.e. , our `` best gaia '' case ) . for a typical tess hot jupiter , which will be observed once every 2 minutes for 27 days ,",
    "if we assume the typical per - point - precision of the flux measurements are 1mmag @xcite , then it should be possible to measure @xmath87 for these systems to a fractional uncertainty of approximately 0.15% @xcite , and the stellar density to approximately 0.25% .",
    "coupled with the previously assumed radius uncertainties , this should allow for the masses of the hot jupiters host stars to be measured to 5% , with the only model assumptions being made in the sed fitting process . for reference",
    ", an interferometric measurement of kelt-11 s stellar diameter would have a precision of approximately 10% @xcite .",
    "kelt-11 is one of the targets in the `` retired a stars '' search for rv planets , which uses a group of sub - giants that are putatively above 1.5@xmath3 . though the planetary companion was not identified until the kelt observations , the statistical results using the other detections from this survey are one of the only windows we have into the planetary demographics of stars more massive than 1.5@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite disputed that the stars targeted by @xcite s survey are more massive than 1.5@xmath3  suggesting instead that the target stars are 1.0@xmath3  to 1.2@xmath3 .",
    "this has lead to a considerable amount of discussion in the literature regarding the true masses of these stars @xcite    0.00 in @xmath3 .",
    "this is similar to the mass found in the fit using the torres relations , but is approximately @xmath5 lower than the fit using only parallactic constraints.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.1 in    as mentioned previously , our adopted fit using the torres relations finds that kelt-11 s mass is @xmath121@xmath3 .",
    "based purely on the transit - derived stellar density and the star s spectroscopic effective temperature , the geneva stellar models give an alternate mass estimate of @xmath120@xmath3(figure [ density ] ) .",
    "the probable true mass of kelt-11 is therefore approximately 1.4@xmath3 .    using the results of single mass measurement to evaluate the ensemble properties of all of the targets stars used by the `` retired a stars '' survey is difficult . while kelt-11 may just be a rare low - mass contaminant in the survey",
    ", the fact kelt-11 s mass is below the ostensible 1.5@xmath3  cut - off for all of the target stars does indicate that the true mass distribution of the `` retired a stars '' sample may not be as clearly above 1.5@xmath3  as assumed in the statistical analyses of the survey s results ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we observed a single transit of kelt-11b @xcite at 3.6@xmath0 m  using the spitzer space telescope .",
    "we fit our spitzer photometry , in conjunction with some of the ground - based photometric measurements provided in @xcite , using a gaussian process regression model .",
    "we simultaneously fit these photometric observations , the rv data from @xcite , and an sed model utilizing catalog magnitudes and the hipparcos parallax to the system , using a single set of stellar , orbital , and planetary parameters .",
    "we performed four fit `` cases '' to the available observations of the kelt-11 system ( tables [ tab : posteriors1 ] and [ tab : posteriors2 ] ) .",
    "first , we fit just the spitzer , rv , and sed data .",
    "second , we fit the spitzer observations , the ground - based observations , and the rv and sed data .",
    "third , we used the spitzer , ground - based , rv , and sed data , but also added modeling constraints on the kelt-11 s mass and radius based on the torres relations @xcite .",
    "finally , we fit the spitzer , ground - based , rv , and sed data , but altered the uncertainty on the measured hipparcos parallax to be match the parallax precision expected of the final gaia data release .",
    "the transit parameters we find using our spitzer photometry are in general agreement with those given in @xcite .",
    "we find that the transit is slightly shallower than the figure given in @xcite , though only at @xmath124 .",
    "the only significant difference between our results and those of @xcite is that we find the total transit duration to be shorter , @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 days , and we find the transit center occurs 6.4 minutes later , and the period is 33 seconds longer , than in the discovery paper .",
    "using the precise spitzer photometry , we are able to measure the density of the star kelt-11 to 6% . using the spectroscopic effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity measurements of kelt-11 ( table [ tab : priors ] ) , both",
    "the torres relations ( table [ tab : posteriors2 ] ) and the geneva stellar models ( figure [ density ] ) predict that kelt-11 should be approximately 1.4@xmath3and 2.6@xmath4 .",
    "the hipparcos parallax , on the other hand , gives a radius of 2.9@xmath4 , and coupled with the measured density this gives a mass of 2.0@xmath3  ( table [ tab : posteriors1 ] ) .",
    "this difference is , however , not statistically significant , owing to the 10% uncertainty on the hipparcos parallax . based on our fitting",
    "we would expect that the gaia parallax for kelt-11 should be approximately 10.7mas , rather than the hipparcos value of @xmath125mas .",
    "the differences between the model and parallactic masses and radii for kelt-11 do serve to demonstrate the role that precise gaia parallaxes , coupled with simultaneous photometric , rv , and sed fitting , can play in determining stellar parameters that are largely model - independent . to illustrate this , we also fit our kelt-11 data , but assumed a parallax error of 7mas ( table [ tab : posteriors2 ] ) . in this case , the differences between the model and hypothetical parallactic masses and radii are now each @xmath18 . with this precision , we could begin to provide additional observational input into the stellar models themselves .",
    "this will only improve in the future , as the photometry available from tess should allow us to measure the density of hot jupiters host stars to 0.25% .",
    "if we combine this with the parallaxes from the final gaia data release , then tess should provide us with 60 to 80 stars for which we can measure the radii to 3% , and masses to 5% , largely independently of stellar models .",
    "this would be an improvement on current state - of - the art interferometric radius measurements , which have typical precision of 5% to 10% at these distances @xcite .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the measurement , interpretation , and modeling of exoplanets has relied heavily on stellar modeling .",
    "the stellar mass and radius measurements made possible by globally fitting the tess photometry , catalog magnitudes , and gaia parallaxes of tess s hot jupiters will thus allow the field of exoplanets to start paying back the debt it owes to the hard work and diligence of the stellar modeling teams .",
