    "the length scale of the @xmath0-orbitals ( @xmath114 ) is typically one order smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "for example , we estimate that @xmath115 at @xmath116 . assuming strong confinement in the @xmath23-axis @xmath117 , the vector @xmath118 linking two atoms in @xmath45 and @xmath46 orbits almost lies in the @xmath11-plane .",
    "when the fermion spin is polarized along the @xmath23-axis , the interaction is repulsive and @xmath105 can be approximately estimated as u ( 1 - 3 ) , where @xmath119 is the angle between @xmath118 and the @xmath23-axis .",
    "we estimate @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and find that @xmath105 can reach the order of @xmath122 .",
    "for example , if we use the laser wavelength @xmath123 , @xmath97 ( so that @xmath124 ) and @xmath125 , we arrive at @xmath126 khz or approximately @xmath127 . increasing @xmath128 can further increase @xmath105 and suppress @xmath47 , thus drive the system into even stronger correlation regime .",
    "@xmath105 can be adjusted from repulsive to attractive by tuning the polarization direction from perpendicular to parallel to the @xmath11-plane .",
    "in this section , we discuss interaction effects in the @xmath0-orbital systems . when the flat band is partially filled",
    ", interaction effects dominate the physics .",
    "in particular , a wigner crystal state is stabilized even with the shortest range on - site interaction .",
    "we will mainly study the spinless fermion system below , and also give a brief discussion on the boson systems , but leave the study of the spinful fermion systems to a future publication .",
    "due to the complete suppression of the kinetic energy in the flat band , the effect of interactions is non - perturbative when the flat band is partially filled .",
    "interestingly , at sufficiently low particle density @xmath130 , the exact many - body ground state can be easily constructed as follows .",
    "each individual particle localizes into a plaquette state depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wannier ] .",
    "any arrangement of these plaquette states avoiding touching each other is the kinetic energy ground state and costs zero interaction energy .",
    "since the interaction is repulsive , this class of states also minimize the interaction energy and thus they constitute the many - body ground states .",
    "if we fix the particle density at @xmath131 , the ground state configurations have large degeneracy corresponding to all the possible ways to arrange these hard hexagons .    another class of systems exhibiting similar behavior is the frustrated magnets near full polarization in a large external magnetic field .",
    "the holstein - primakoff magnons , which are bosons , have a dispersionless flat band over the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "interactions among magnons result in the magnon crystal state and magnetization plateau @xcite near the full polarization . however , this flat band behavior is difficult to observe because a very strong magnetic field to drive the system close to the full polarization is required .",
    "this means that the zeeman energy reaches the exchange energy @xmath132 which is typically larger the order of mev .",
    "flat band phenomenon also appears in systems of `` fermion condensation '' where strong interactions drive an originally dispersive band to flat within a finite width around the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "this has been proposed to explain the curie s law behavior of the magnetic susceptibility in the itinerant heavy fermion compound cecoin@xmath133 system @xcite .",
    "the close packed plaquette pattern without overlapping each other is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : closepack ] corresponding to the filling of @xmath3 .",
    "the completely filled lowest flat band corresponds to @xmath4 , thus this close packed plaquette pattern corresponds to @xmath134-filling of the flat band .",
    "this state breaks the lattice translational symmetry and is three - fold degenerate .",
    "the other two equivalent states can be obtained by translating the state in fig .",
    "[ fig : closepack ] along @xmath34-axis in the right or left direction at one lattice constant .",
    "the above wigner crystal state is a gapped state",
    ". we can give a rough estimation for a upper limit of the charge gap by constructing a trial wavefunciton for putting an extra particle in the close packed state in fig .",
    "[ fig : closepack ] . in the weak interaction case",
    "@xmath135 , we can put the extra atom in the plaquette state located at @xmath57 which is adjacent to three occupied plaquettes @xmath136 . since there is already @xmath137 atom on average per site ,",
    "the cost of the repulsion is @xmath138 . on the other hand , in the strong coupling case @xmath139 , we put the particle into an excited state of the occupied plaquette @xmath140 while fixing the orbital configuration on each site .",
    "because fermions are spinless , the cost of energy comes from the kinetic part with the value of @xmath141 .",
    "thus we obtain the upper limit for the charge gap which is determined by interaction at small values of @xmath105 and by kinetic energy @xmath47 at large values of @xmath105 as 6 t_@xmath142t_/t_=0.1@xmath143@xmath144u > t_@xmath145t_/t_@xmath146v / e_r@xmath147u@xmath148n=@xmath149p@xmath150n@xmath151l_z@xmath152p@xmath153p@xmath1541/6@xmath155@xmath156n=1@xmath157n>1/6@xmath158u / t_=1@xmath159@xmath160@xmath161@xmath162@xmath163@xmath164@xmath165@xmath166n@xmath167@xmath168@xmath169p@xmath1700.44@xmath171>1/2@xmath172=1@xmath173s@xmath174p_x , y@xmath175p_x , y@xmath176s@xmath177@xmath160@xmath178u / t=10@xmath179=  ( i=1~6)@xmath180t_@xmath181=1@xmath182u@xmath183t_@xmath184>@xmath185=@xmath186=@xmath1871~6@xmath188p@xmath189p_x@xmath190p_x p_y ( = 158.4^)@xmath191x@xmath192p@xmath193x@xmath194(1 , 6)@xmath1958.4^@xmath196n_6,2,3,5=0.27@xmath197n_1,4=0.46@xmath198i , j@xmath199b_ij=-@xmath200(i , j)=(2,1 ) ; ( 2,3 ) ; ( 2 , 5^ ) ; ( 1 , 4^)@xmath2014^@xmath2025^@xmath2034@xmath2025@xmath204b_2,1=0.58 t_@xmath190b_2,3=0.04 t_@xmath205b_2,5^=0.14 t_@xmath202b_1,4^=0@xmath2060.446t_@xmath207@xmath208t_@xmath209=@xmath210=@xmath211=153^@xmath212n_6,2,3,5=0.76@xmath190n_1,4=0.49@xmath213b_2,1=0.70 t_@xmath190b_2,3=0.07 t_@xmath190b_2,5^=0.12 t_@xmath197b_1,4^=0.02 t_@xmath214=@xmath215=@xmath216b_1,6=0.95 t_@xmath217b_1,2=0.1 t_@xmath218t_@xmath219t^2_/u@xmath220p_x ,",
