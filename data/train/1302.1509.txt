    "answering the questions whether total lepton number is a conserved quantity or not , and thus whether neutrinos are massive majorana fermions , is a crucial part of the search for the `` physics beyond the standard model '' .",
    "consequently , experimental searches for the @xmath5 decay are pursued worldwide ( for a recent review of the field , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , interpreting existing results and planning new experiments is impossible without the knowledge of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the nuclear matrix elements @xmath7 of the @xmath5 decay must be determined using nuclear structure theory , and the choice of the appropriate approximations is a crucial part of that task .",
    "some of the methods employed for evaluation of the @xmath7 , in particular those that begin with the transformation from particles to quasiparticles to account for the like - nucleon pairing ( see e.g. @xcite ) , use wave functions that do not exactly conserve the particle number .",
    "the number of protons and neutrons is usually conserved on average or , in some cases , it is restored by the particle number projection . in either case , until now no attempt was made to check that the isospin , which is known to be , to a very good approximation , valid quantum number in nuclei , remains as such in the resulting wave functions that are obtained by solving the corresponding equations of motion .    it is well known that by the proper treatment of the quasiparticle interaction the broken symmetries can be restored .",
    "naturally , exact calculation would restore the broken symmetries exactly .",
    "however , even with the approximate , rpa - like treatment , it is possible to partially restore some of the broken symmetries . in this work we show , following basically the suggestions made initially in ref.@xcite , how this can be done in the case of isospin and by doing that the values of the fermi nuclear matrix elements , both for the @xmath0 and @xmath5 decays , are substantially modified .",
    "even though the resulting total @xmath7 nuclear matrix elements are changed only by @xmath8 10% , it is worthwhile , and certainly more consistent , to use in future the prescriptions described below .",
    "assuming that the @xmath5 decay is caused by the exchange of light majorana neutrinos , the half - life and the nuclear matrix element are related through @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the calculable phase space factor , @xmath11 is the effective neutrino majorana mass whose determination is the ultimate goal of the experiments , and @xmath12 is the nuclear matrix element consisting of gamow - teller , fermi and tensor parts , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the matrix element ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "( in the literature a different notation is sometimes used , @xmath18 . )    the main gt part , @xmath19 , can be somewhat symbolically written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the neutrino potential described in detail in @xcite and @xmath22 is the relative distance between the two neutrons that are transformed in the decay into the two protons .",
    "analogously , the fermi matrix element is @xmath23 note that these @xmath5 matrix elements are expressed in the closure approximation ; its applicability is also discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the results reported later in this work were obtained without using the closure ; instead explicit summation over all virtual intermediate states was performed .",
    "the half - life of the experimentally well studied @xmath0 decay depends formally on two nuclear matrix elements @xmath24 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the gamow - teller @xmath0 matrix element is @xmath25 where the summation extends over all @xmath26 virtual intermediate states . in that case",
    "the closure approximation is not a valid approach but can be formally introduced by defining the corresponding closure matrix element @xmath27 when replacing the energies @xmath28 by the proper average value @xmath29 .",
    "thus , @xmath30    formally , in the description of the @xmath0 decay also appears the fermi matrix element @xmath31 where the summation extends over all @xmath32 virtual intermediate states , and its closure form is @xmath33 the ground state @xmath34 of the initial nucleus has isospin @xmath35 while the final state @xmath36 has isospin @xmath37 .",
    "since the operator @xmath38 just changes the isospin projection and can not change the total isospin , it is obvious that when isospin is a good quantum number both fermi matrix elements must vanish , @xmath39 since the average energy denominators in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2nufcl ] ) are nonvanishing .",
    "until now , within qrpa , phfb , edf and ibm-2 methods the validity of condition eq.([eq:2nuf0 ] ) has not been usually tested ( @xcite ) .",
    "when results were published , @xmath1 and @xmath40 do not vanish and are , in fact , comparable to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . despite that ,",
    "when evaluating the @xmath0 half - life the fermi matrix element was usually simply neglected .    as we show further , in the usual application of qrpa the condition eq.([eq:2nuf0 ] ) is not obeyed . instead , the magnitude of @xmath1 is numerically comparable to the magnitude of @xmath41 as just pointed out .",
    "in addition , for the @xmath5 decay , within qrpa the ratio @xmath43 while in the nuclear shell model , where isospin is a good quantum number by construction , the condition eq.([eq:2nuf0 ] ) is , naturally , obeyed and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "where does this problem in qrpa method originate ?",
    "the method begins with the bogoliubov transformation relating the particle creation and annihilation operators @xmath45 with the quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators @xmath46 . by solving the bcs equations one includes the neutron - neutron and proton - proton isovector pairing interactions .    at this stage",
    "several symmetries are broken .",
    "the numbers of protons @xmath47 and neutrons @xmath48 are no longer exact , but valid only on average .",
    "in addition , since the neutron - proton part of the isovector pairing interaction is neglected , additional source of isospin violation is introduced .",
    "it turns out that it is relatively easy to remedy this additional effect and restore the isospin conservation , at least in part , as explained further here .",
    "as the rpa ( and qrpa ) is derived from the equation of motion for bifermionic operators ( treated in the quasiboson approximation ) , symmetries of the model hamiltonian can naturally be fulfilled in that approximation .    to proceed further , the equations of motion need to be solved . within the qrpa method the forward- and backward - going amplitudes @xmath49 and",
    "@xmath50 that are needed for the evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements , as well as the corresponding energy eigenvalues @xmath51 , are determined by solving the eigenvalue equations of motion for each angular momentum and parity @xmath52 @xmath53    the matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath56 | o \\rangle \\\\",

    "but the particle - particle neutron - proton interaction governed by @xmath2 actually contains two kinds of interaction matrix elements , isovector and isoscalar .",
    "thus , to be consistent with the treatment of the like particle pairing , one should separate the @xmath61 part from the @xmath62 part , i.e. replace @xmath63 and adjust the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 independently . to partially restore the isospin symmetry and achieve that eq.([eq:2nuf0 ] )",

    "the resulting @xmath70 is then almost the same one as with the old parametrization with the single @xmath2 value .    when the new parametrization of the particle - particle renormalization constants is used in the qrpa evaluation of the @xmath5 nuclear matrix elements , a substantial reduction of the fermi part , @xmath6 , is observed , while the gamow - teller and tensor parts remain essentially unaffected .",
