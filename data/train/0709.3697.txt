    "this short contribution is dedicated to the memory of vladimir geyler , our dear colleague and friend who , to our great sorrow , passed recently and very unexpectedly away . among his numerous scientific activities in the framework of mathematical physics",
    "one can point out his interest in the influence of nontrivial geometries on the properties of quantum mechanical systems which was very intensive especially in the last period .",
    "let us mention just a few of his results focused on this sort of problems : the effect of surface curvature on magnetic moment and persistent currents @xcite , the general form of on - diagonal singularities of the green function for schrdinger operators on curved spaces @xcite , and zero modes in a system of aharonov - bohm solenoids on the lobachevsky plane @xcite .",
    "in one of the very last scientific contributions due to vladimir geyler @xcite , on which we had the pleasure to collaborate , a quantum dot with impurity in the lobachevsky plane is discussed .",
    "this paper was intended as a step towards an extension to the hyperbolic plane of results derived in @xcite where a similar problem is treated in the case of the euclidean geometry .",
    "the current article aims to complete the discussion from @xcite by a short numerical analysis of spectral properties of the harmonic oscillator on the lobachevsky plane .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the effect of the surface curvature on these properties .    it has been observed already some time ago that various solvable quantum mechanical systems admit an explicit treatment also in the case of hyperbolic geometry , though with interesting nontrivial modifications ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "also the spectral problem for the quantum harmonic oscillator on the lobachevsky plane , as we introduce it below , leads to a differential equation which is well known from the theory of special functions , namely to the differential equation of spheroidal functions . it should be emphasized , however , that the history of spheroidal functions is much more recent than that of more traditional special functions like bessel functions or legendre polynomials .",
    "for example , one of the basic monographs devoted to these functions appeared only in the fifties of the last century @xcite . also the notation is still not fully uniform .",
    "one can compare , for example , @xcite with @xcite . here",
    "we follow the latter source . furthermore , there are cases of values of parameters on which the spheroidal functions depend that have not been fully investigated . in this connection",
    "we note that particularly the values of parameters which are of interest for our model are treated in the textbooks in a rather marginal way . also effective numerical algorithms to evaluate",
    "the spheroidal functions seem to be rather tedious to create and not available for all cases .",
    "these circumstances make the numerical and qualitative analysis of the spectrum more complicated than one might expect at first glance .",
    "the numerical results presented in this contribution were derived with the aid of the computer algebra system _",
    "mathematica_. on the contrary to other `` more traditional '' special functions , the spheroidal functions were implemented in this system only in the version which was the very last one at the time of this writing .",
    "denote by @xmath1 , @xmath5 , the so called curvature radius which is related to the scalar curvature by the formula @xmath6 , and by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the geodesic polar coordinates on the lobachevsky plane .",
    "taking the mass equal @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the hamiltonian has the form @xmath12 and is defined in @xmath13 on its natural domain . here",
    "@xmath14 is the potential of the harmonic oscillator on the hyperbolic plane .",
    "its choice is ambiguous .",
    "of course , one requires that in the flat limit , @xmath15 , @xmath16 becomes the usual potential of the isotropic harmonic oscillator on the euclidean plane , @xmath17 .",
    "at least three choices of @xmath14 have been discussed in the literature so far .",
    "a distinguished possibility is @xmath18 since in that case one gets a hamiltonian with a comparatively rich symmetry , a so called super - integrable model .",
    "this is demonstrated in detail on the level of classical mechanics in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "notice that this potential is bounded and thus the spectrum of the corresponding quantum hamiltonian contains an absolutely continuous part , the interval @xmath19 .",
    "the spectral analysis for this case is covered by paper @xcite .",
    "it turns out that",
    "@xmath20 as @xmath15 , and so the continuous part disappears in the flat limit .",
    "moreover , as expected , the number of eigenvalues in the curved case is finite but tends to infinity in the flat limit , and the eigenvalues approach the discrete spectrum of the flat hamiltonian .",
    "further , a nonlinear quantum model with a potential of the type @xmath21 depending on a parameter @xmath22 is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the treatment of this model also relies heavily on symmetry properties which allow for explicit solutions .    in the current paper",
    "we stick , however , to a choice made in @xcite and otherwise not discussed in the above cited papers .",
    "we set @xmath23 with this choice , the potential is unbounded , likewise as in the euclidean case .",
    "consequently , the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath24 has a purely discrete spectrum depending on the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "next we rescale the hamiltonian letting @xmath25 substituting @xmath26 we obtain @xmath27 in @xmath28 . using the rotational symmetry which amounts to a fourier transform in the variable @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 may be decomposed into a direct sum as follows @xmath31 for all @xmath32 , @xmath33 acts in @xmath34 .",
    "denote by @xmath35 , @xmath32 , the restrictions of @xmath24 to the eigenspace of the angular momentum with value @xmath3 .",
    "we prefer to regard @xmath35 as an operator in @xmath36 .",
    "this assumes an obvious unitary transform to pass from the measure @xmath37 in the @xmath38 space on @xmath39 to the measure @xmath40 . on the general grounds ,",
    "the spectrum of @xmath35 is semibounded below , discrete and simple @xcite .",
    "set @xmath41 if @xmath42 , @xmath43 , is the @xmath44the eigenvalue of @xmath33 then @xmath45 is the @xmath44th eigenvalue of @xmath35 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation @xmath46 written in the coordinate @xmath47 takes the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 differential equation ( [ eq : spheroidal ] ) is known in the theory of special functions as the differential equation of spheroidal functions @xcite .",
    "the notation used below follows the source @xcite .",
    "all parameters in ( [ eq : spheroidal ] ) are in general complex numbers .",
    "there are two solutions that behave like @xmath50 times a single - valued function and @xmath51 times a single - valued function at @xmath52 .",
    "the exponent @xmath53 is a function of @xmath22 , @xmath54 , @xmath3 , and is called the characteristic exponent . usually , it is more convenient to regard @xmath22 as a function of @xmath53 , @xmath3 and @xmath54",
    ". we shall write @xmath55 . the functions @xmath56 obey the symmetry relations @xmath57    a first group of solutions ( the so called radial spheroidal functions ) is obtained as expansions in series of bessel functions .",
    "they are denoted @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "several relations between the radial spheroidal functions are known , notably @xmath60 and @xmath61 also the asymptotic behavior of radial spheroidal functions is well known .",
    "it turns out that among these functions the only one which is square integrable near infinity is @xmath62 . for @xmath63",
    "it holds @xmath64 as @xmath65 .    to control the behavior near the singular point @xmath66 one uses expansions in series in legendre functions .",
    "these solutions are called angular spheroidal functions and are denoted @xmath67 and @xmath68 . there",
    "exist relations between these two types of spheroidal functions .",
    "in particular , it holds @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a coefficient independent of @xmath47 . consequently , @xmath71    the angular spheroidal functions asymptotically behave , as @xmath65 , in the following way : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is some coefficient ( for its definition we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , we have @xmath74 furthermore , @xmath75 and @xmath76 it follows that @xmath77    we conclude that @xmath78 is an eigenfunction and , at the same time , @xmath79 is an eigenvalue of @xmath33 if and only if @xmath80 has no singularity as @xmath81 .",
    "further we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath82 .",
    "the function @xmath83 is real for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and becomes negative if @xmath86 is sufficiently large .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath87 are the numbers @xmath88 where @xmath86 solves the equation @xmath89 because of symmetry ( [ eq : lambdasym ] ) it suffices to consider @xmath90 .",
    "equivalently , in the numerical computations the following form of this equation proved itself to be rather effective : @xmath91    finally , we present a few numerical results .",
    "figure  [ fig : evs ] depicts several first eigenvalues of @xmath92 .",
    "more precisely , the figure contains plots of eigenvalues @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "these functions of the variable @xmath95 decrease monotonically , and in the limit @xmath96 they approach the eigenvalues in the flat case , namely @xmath97 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath98 the eigenvalues tend to infinity .",
    "next we plot the corresponding eigenfunctions for several values of the parameter @xmath99 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath100 .",
    "the last value corresponds to the flat case . to reach this goal it was necessary to fix the value of @xmath101 .",
    "we have taken @xmath102 .",
    "then the chosen values of @xmath99 correspond to the curvature radius @xmath103 .",
    "an eigenfunction @xmath80 of @xmath87 equals @xmath104 times a normalization factor for a suitable value of @xmath105 .",
    "the plotted eigenfunctions are expressed in the variable @xmath2 .",
    "thus the transformed eigenfunction of @xmath92 in @xmath36 equals @xmath106 the fact that we stick to the same hilbert space in all cases , namely to @xmath36 , facilitates the comparison of eigenfunctions for various values of the curvature radius .",
    "the same hilbert space is used also in the limiting euclidean case when @xmath107 .",
    "the eigenfunctions for the flat case are , of course , well known from textbooks .",
    "let us recall that in the euclidean plane we have @xmath108 looking at figures [ fig : ef0 ] , [ fig : ef1 ] and [ fig : ef2 ] depicting the eigenfunctions indexed @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , one observes clearly that a more curved space ( corresponding to smaller @xmath1 ) forces the eigenfunctions to concentrate more closely to the center of the harmonic oscillator ."
