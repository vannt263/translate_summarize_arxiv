    "<S> [ fig : max_sbq_ts]b . for the density that we have discussed so far ( @xmath22 , leftmost set of data ) the curves for the different temperatures fall at short and intermediate times nicely on a master curve , thus demonstrating that it is indeed possible to define a single time scale @xmath42 that describes the structural relaxation leading to the formation of the clusters . the observed master curve increases first quickly ( the @xmath26dependence is basically an exponential ) before it crosses over to a much slower ( logarithmic ) time dependence . for even longer times </S>",
    "<S> the curves bend again upwards . this final change in the @xmath26dependence </S>",
    "<S> is not related to a growth of the peak at @xmath60 but instead to the growth of the structure factor at small wave - vectors due to the coarsening that sets in at late times ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : max_sbq_tb]a , inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the extent of the quasi plateau at intermediate times depends strongly on @xmath7 and thus , if @xmath7 is sufficiently low , the final step of the phase separation can be moved to very large times , thus allowing to form a stable gel .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25-dependence that we have just discussed is for a high density of polymers . if @xmath28 is decreased the initial increase of the peak at @xmath61 is delayed because the b monomers are on average farther apart and the plateau at intermediate times is less pronounced ( see inset of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : max_sbq_ts]b ) . for low densities </S>",
    "<S> the plateau seems to disappear completely , at least in the temperature range that we show here . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out simulations at even lower @xmath7 and found that the plateau is present even at this density . </S>",
    "<S> ] however , for all cases we can define a @xmath62dependent scaling factor @xmath41 that allows to superimpose the peak height for short and intermediate times ( main panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : max_sbq_ts]b ) . since all of these factors have the same arrhenius dependence and the same activation energy if @xmath28 is not too small ( see supplemental fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : arrhenius_st ] ) , we can conclude that the growth of the clusters is completely governed by the b - b interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also instructive to study the time - dependence of the structure as a function of the time scale @xmath37 , i.e.  as a function of the concentration of b monomers . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath63dependence of the height of the peak at @xmath64 is shown in the main graph of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : max_sbq_tb]a from which we recognize that this peak grows faster if @xmath7 is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is reasonable since at low @xmath7 the entropic fluctuations are reduced and hence the system can reach more easily an energetically favorable structure , i.e.  form the clusters . for long times , i.e.  when the system starts coarsening on the mesoscopic scale , the curves for different @xmath7 s superimpose which indicates that the coarsening process is indeed completely governed by the concentration of the b monomers , i.e. the effective attractive interaction between the polymers ( see also fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : max_sbq_tb]a , inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the fact that the total structure factors at large fixed @xmath37 but different @xmath7 s superimpose for all wave - vectors ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : max_sbq_tb]b for @xmath65 ) thus indicating a phase separation driven by the fraction of b monomers , but influenced by the formation of b clusters at short and intermediate times .    </S>",
    "<S> our simulations of this catalyst - induced gelation process show that the resulting polymer gels can have a microscopic quasi - ordered cluster phase , i.e.  a structure that is absent in gels that are formed by a quench in temperature or by the addition of a chemical agent . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the details of this process can be understood in a simple manner from the effective reaction rate of the catalyst and the strength of the resulting attraction between the monomers . </S>",
    "<S> this understanding will thus allow to produce also in real life gels with such ordered microstructure and hence this catalytic reaction is a new approach to design materials with novel structures and mechanical properties as they are needed , e.g. , for scaffolds in tissue engineering  @xcite .    </S>",
