    "after the main sequence evolutionary phase , stars evolve to the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "this evolution is initiated by the ignition of shell h - burning surrounding the he core , whose energy flux causes the envelope to expand and the star evolves to the rgb .",
    "the expansion increases the opacity and leads to the development of a deep convective envelope .",
    "this is the first dredge up event ( fdup ) , as convection mixes up the products of h - burning to the surface altering the surface composition of the star .    in the mass range",
    "( @xmath13-@xmath14m@xmath2 , stars exhibit blue loops at the beginning of core he burning ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the main phase of core he - burning is completed before the track evolves back to the rgb .",
    "this leads again to the deepening of envelope convection . for solar metallicity stars of m @xmath154m@xmath2 , a second dredge up ( sdup ) can reach deeper regions , which leads to further changes in the surface abundances .",
    "this work uses observations obtained for a sample of red giants by @xcite , hereafter tsuji08 , in order to achieve two goals : ( a ) to estimate the masses of these giants by matching their observationally derived effective temperatures and bolometric magnitudes to the values obtained from the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram .",
    "this is possible since the stars are not pulsating mira variables ( see section 3.1 for details ) .",
    "we are able to improve the mass determination done by tsuji08 by using more extended evolutionary tracks to avoid the extrapolation that he partially relied on to determine the mass of some giants , ( b ) to compare the calculated cno abundances of these models to those inferred from observations in the light of recent determinations of key reaction rates .",
    "a large body of observational data is available for the surface cno abundances in rgb stars @xcite .",
    "these data provide a powerful tool to get insight into the internal structure of evolved stars . in particular , comparing the predicted oxygen surface abundances to the observed data is useful to improve the treatment of convective mixing in the stellar interiors ( see section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "our results suggest the need for extra mixing below the edge of the convective envelope as determined by the schwarzschild criterion in order to achieve a better agreement with observations .",
    "this extra mixing has been suggested in several investigations in connection with the evolution of field giants @xcite , open clusters @xcite , globular clusters @xcite as well as to explain isotopic ratios in pre - solar grains @xcite .",
    "the abundance profile of @xmath16o of particular interest .",
    "this is because this isotope is produced by the on - cycle which requires higher temperatures than the cn - cycle .",
    "therefore , the @xmath16o profile exhibits a steep gradient within the central region of the star , at the position of maximum convective penetration ( shown later in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "this renders the @xmath16o surface abundance sensitive to the depth of convective mixing , stellar mass and to the nuclear reaction rates involved in the cno  cycle @xcite .",
    "we show in section 3.2.2 how the @xmath5o@xmath6o ratio is useful to constrain this extra mixing .",
    "the low surface carbon isotopic ratios in low mass stars however , can not be explained by our extra - mixing treatment .",
    "other non - standard mixing mechanisms may need to be invoked as shown in section 3.2 .",
    "@xcite also discuss carbon isotopic ratios in agb  stars in connection with their recent estimations of circumstellar @xmath17co@xmath18co abundance ratios based on radiative transfer analysis of radio line emission observations .    concerning the nuclear reaction network ,",
    "there has been extensive experimental work recently on updated determinations of major reaction rates , including those of the cno cycle .",
    "one set of rates that we use @xcite was obtained with the trojan horse method @xcite , which is an indirect technique that is able to provide more reliable reaction rate cross - sections at low temperatures where measurements in the astrophysical energy range are available .",
    "other sets , obtained by @xcite and @xcite are evaluated based on monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "this method provides a median rate which -under certain conditions- resembles the commonly referred to recommended  rate , as well as a low rate and a high rate which , unlike the upper  and lower  limits of classical rates , have a well - defined statistical meaning .",
    "the effect of these recent determinations of the proton capture reactions including the @xmath10n@xmath11p@xmath12o rate on the isotopic ratios @xmath5o@xmath6o and @xmath10n@xmath8n is investigated@xmath9    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the calculations and provides a summary of the observational data used in this work .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 .",
    "mass determinations and comparison with previous works are provided in section 3.1 . in section 3.2 ,",

    "the evolutionary sequences presented in this work are obtained using the stellar evolution code hyades as described in @xcite , with the recent modifications outlined in @xcite .",
    "this code is a one - dimensional implicit lagrangian code based on a hydrodynamical method which solves the stellar structure equations on an adaptive grid .",
    "mass - loss is included using semi - empirical rates adjusted to the global parameters of the star .",

    "it is clear from eq .",
    "[ diff ] that for smaller values of @xmath33 d has a steeper profile , or equivalently less extra mixing .",
    "as @xmath32 increases , this extra mixing extends further beyond the formal convective boundary .",
    "the numerical simulations by @xcite find @xmath32 = 0.25 @xmath34  0.05 and 1.0 @xmath34  0.1 for a - stars and da white dwarfs , respectively .",
    "we will use the observationally inferred oxygen isotopic ratio in red giants to constrain the value of @xmath32 ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the mixing of chemical elements is achieved by solving the diffusion equation given by : @xmath35 \\label{dif}%\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the radius , @xmath37 is the mass density and d is  the diffusion coefficient given by eq .",
    "[ diff ] when used in the overshoot region , otherwise it is equal to d@xmath30 in a convective zone according to the schwarzschild criterion .          to illustrate the effect of the treatment of mixing described above , fig .",
    "[ grad ] shows the behavior of @xmath38 @xmath39 as well as the profiles of the diffusion coefficient and hydrogen ( x@xmath40 ) as a function of interior mass .",
    "this is done for a 1.2m@xmath2 model during the first dredge up phase ( fdup ) after the star has evolved to the red giant branch .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig . [ grad ] shows the extension of the convective envelope in the standard models , i.e. without overshooting where the abrupt drop of the diffusion coefficient d is visible along with the vertical drop of x@xmath41 the right panel shows the behavior with overshooting .",
    "it is seen that in the latter case , mixing is extended into the radiative region where @xmath42 .",
    "the lower panels show the profiles at the next time - step , 3@xmath43 years later . in both cases ,",
    "the convective envelope deepens in mass as fdup proceeds , but it is deeper in the case with overshooting , where the change in composition alters the opacity so that @xmath44 becomes satisfied deeper in mass .",
    "therefore , overshooting does not only induce extra mixing but also drives convective instability .",
    "details of the present calculations with this overshooting or extra diffusive mixing are provided in section 3.2.2 .",
    "a sample of red giant stars has been observed by tsuji08 as given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the effective temperatures were obtained using the infrared flux method @xcite , while the absolute bolometric magnitudes were determined from the bolometric luminosities obtained by integrating the spectral energy distributions and the hipparcos parallaxes .",

    "theoretical models are also challenged by uncertainties in convective mixing , mass loss and nuclear reaction rates , where standard fdup models often face difficulties in explaining carbon and oxygen surface abundances , particularly in low - mass stars . while being vigilant to these limitations , a careful comparison is useful for the sake of a better understanding .",

    "the predicted @xmath5o@xmath6o shows a distinct behavior between high and low mass stars , which will be discussed separately . for the higher masses ( m@xmath310 @xmath125m@xmath311 , the standard calculation predicts @xmath5o@xmath6o ratios that fit the observed range within the error bars on the stellar masses . the relative spread in the observational values in this mass range",
    "can not be explained by overshooting since in these stars the bump in the @xmath16o profile is fully mixed by the formal convective envelope as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b , so overshooting will not introduce a significant change to the standard predictions .",
    "therefore , we attribute this spread to the uncertainties in describing the properties of the relatively cool red giants . this is a general feature of observationally inferred data due to the above mentioned uncertainties in measuring faint lines in their spectra which may result in considerably variant ratios for the same object among different observations .",
    "we expect that the error bars of these ratios are underestimated , particularly in stars like @xmath52 cet and @xmath52 her whose ratio varies considerably among different works as shown in table [ tab4 ] .    in the case of the lower mass stars , the theoretical @xmath5o@xmath6o is higher than most data points obtained from observations .",
    "the results of standard calculation by other groups shown in the figure indicate a similar behavior . it is noted that the high observational @xmath5o@xmath6o values in the low mass stars like @xmath52 tau , @xmath65 vir , @xmath85 lib , @xmath77 peg , @xmath48 vir , and rr umi , which are denoted by up - pointing triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , are estimations due to the uncertainties in measuring faint lines like @xmath17c@xmath16o in relatively cool atmospheres , where at such low temperatures the absorption lines are strong causing severe blending by several weak lines and introducing uncertainties ( tsuji08 ) . due to such complications , weak lines could nt be measured at all for @xmath17c@xmath16o in these stars , and @xmath5o@xmath6o is not well determined .",
    "thus , these observational data points are not reliable to compare to our calculation .",
    "our discussion is based on the low observational ratios in low mass stars which are more definitive , with well - determined error bars .",
    "the overproduction of @xmath5o@xmath6o in low mass stars in our model shows that more @xmath16o needs to be mixed to the surface in order to lower the @xmath5o@xmath6o ratio .",

    "the errors on the masses are as listed in table [ tab2 ] . ]",
    "it is known that after the star leaves the main sequence , fdup alters significantly the surface abundances as it enriches the envelope with @xmath312he , @xmath202c , @xmath16o and @xmath10n and reduces its @xmath17c , @xmath313n and @xmath204o abundance .",
    "every star that evolves to the agb experiences the fdup episode , and starts its early agb phase with a sharp composition discontinuity at the point of maximum penetration of the fdup .",
    "the h - burning shell in low - mass stars represents an entropy barrier that prevents any deeper penetration of the convective envelope , and thus no further change in the surface abundances takes place .",
    "however , for solar metallicity stars of masses above @xmath122-@xmath13m@xmath2 , the gravitational energy release due to the contracting core and the increased energy flux from the burning he - shell lead to an expansion so that the h - shell is pushed outwards in mass to low temperatures causing a temporary extinction in the h - burning shell .",
    "this situation , coupled to the drop in the temperature of the expanding layers and the increase in the opacity @xcite , causes convection to deepen in a second dredge up ( sdup ) event and mixes out the composition discontinuity left over by the fdup .",
    "therefore , sdup introduces further changes in the surface abundances of stars of masses @xmath314m@xmath2 .",
    "the mass on the y - axis is given as the mass reached by the dredge up over the total initial stellar mass , in solar units . ]",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the maximum penetration of the convective envelope at fdup and sdup as a function of the initial stellar mass .",
    "it is clear from the figure that for m@xmath20 ( 4-@xmath315m@xmath2 , sdup does nt penetrate deeper than the fdup , and thus , it does not introduce significant change to the surface composition .",

    "the expansion is strong and convection extends deeper inwards . since low mass stars do not experience sdup",
    ", this implies that their observed surface abundances on the agb phase are actually inherited  from the rgb phase .",
    "therefore , one way to account for the discrepancy between calculated and observationally inferred values of @xmath5o@xmath6o in these stars is to invoke extra mixing below the convective envelope on the rgb phase .",

    "it is noted how overshooting has a minor effect in stars of m @xmath320m@xmath2 .",

    "such mixing process is linked to the long evolutionary time of the low - mass stars while ascending the rgb . as discussed in some details in @xcite , the so - called thermohaline mixing  or salt - finger instability  seems to be one possible description of this extra mixing in low - mass red giant stars .",

    "it is found that our values are higher by @xmath325 20% relative to those by @xcite in stars of masses @xmath320m@xmath2 .",
