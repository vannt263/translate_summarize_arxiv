    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a testbed of strongly interacting many - body systems .",
    "the advantages of these systems compared to corresponding models in condensed matter physics lie in the high controllability in terms of purity , parameters , state preparation , and state detection @xcite . since the seminal experiment by bloch and co - workers , where the mott - superfluid phase transition was first realized @xcite , numerous experimental achievements have been accomplished .",

    "experiments on spinor condensates include , for example , coherent transport in optical lattices @xcite , spin - mixing @xcite , inherent spin tunneling @xcite , and symmetry breaking @xcite . in these works , as for mixtures of atomic species in optical lattices @xcite , direct coupling between the internal states is not considered .",

    "they particularly showed that the mott - superfluid phase transition may be of first order and that ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic types of superfluid states can exist in such coupled models . later in ref .",
    "@xcite , garca - ripoll and co - workers considered individual lattice configurations for internal ( dressed ) atomic states .",
    "coupling between atoms in these two lattices was induced by atom collisions . in an earlier contribution @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated an inherent topological phase transition in fermionic systems originating from the interplay between internal and external atomic degrees of freedom rather than kinetic and atom - atom interaction energies as is normally the case for cold atoms in optical lattices .    in this paper",
    "we examine a gas of ultracold interacting bosonic @xmath0-atoms in an one dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the two atomic transitions are driven by one laser field rendering the optical lattice and another external laser lacking any spatial dependence in its mode profile .",
    "the largely detuned excited atomic level is adiabatically eliminated resulting in an effective coupled @xmath1 model .",
    "an essential point of the resulting hamiltonian is that decoupling of the two equations into two separate schrdinger ( or gross - pitaevskii ) equations is only possible in adiabatic or diabatic regimes .",
    "the novel physics , however , is found in the intermediate regime , which will be analyzed in this work . in the next section",
    "we show that the spectrum of the single particle hamiltonian possesses several interesting features , such as anomalous dispersions with multiple local minima .",

    "the magnitudes of the hamiltonian parameters , obtained from overlap integrals containing the numerically computed wannier functions , allow us to collect the significant terms . in the parameter regimes studied in this contribution",
    ", we end up with a bose - hubbard hamiltonian , where the boson operators create or annihilate atoms in certain superpositions of their internal states . utilizing the strong coupling expansion",
    ", we are able to find the system phase diagram in sec .  [ ssec4b ] .",
    "in contrast to the usual tight - binding bose - hubbard model , our system possesses four different phases : two superfluid states and two mott states characterized by different collective atomic population inversions . moreover , the two superfluid phases have either zero or @xmath2 phase modulation between neighboring sites , giving them a ferro- or antiferromagnetic property .",
    "it is demonstrated that time - of - flight measurements would provide the information needed to distinguish between the two superfluid states as well as between the mott states and the superfluids , while the two mott states can be identified via state dependent detection .",
    "in order to obtain a many - body theory , we first consider properties of the corresponding single particle hamiltonian .",

    "we should point out that solving the gross - pitaevskii equation is only justified deep in the superfluid regime , but nonetheless , we believe that the above analysis utilizing very large scattering amplitudes demonstrates the robustness of the assumption of neglecting coupling between the two bases sets ( see also @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the anomalous structure of the dispersions is also encountered in a two dimensional lattice .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite we studied the dynamics of the mean - field pt deriving from the atypical dispersions in both one and two dimensions , and proved its persistence in two dimensions .",
    "thereby , it is clear that our findings are not restricted to the special case of a one dimensional lattice , but apply also to higher dimensions .",
    "however , in the present work , studying higher dimensions would be considerably more cumbersome as the hamiltonian can not be written as a simple sum of lattice potentials in the different spatial directions , and consequently calculation of the corresponding bloch and wannier functions are not as straight forward as for a regular dispersive square or cubic lattice .",
    "moreover , the strong coupling expansion used for determining the phase diagrams in the proceeding section only provides quantitatively accurate results in one dimension , while in two and three dimensions it reproduces only qualitative results .",

    "we systematically discuss the justification of such assumptions .",
    "a rule of thumb is that these approximations are all related in the regular bose - hubbard model and share more or less the same validity regimes @xcite .",

    "this , of course , is due to our choice of parameters . as a second check of the tight binding approximation ,",
    "we have modified the strong coupling expansion to include tunneling processes beyond nearest neighbors and recalculated the phase diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and found only minimal corrections .",
    "note that when @xmath106 , the tight binding approximation in general fails . in this regime ,",
    "however , the hopping terms beyond nearest neighbor are , for the examples presented in this paper , very small such that the dynamics is predominantly driven by the onsite interaction and therefore the system must be in a mott state .    the justification for the use of the single band approximation has been investigated by evaluating overlap integrals between spinor wannier functions of the first and the second band . for fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] , we found that these coupling elements are everywhere much smaller than @xmath93 and @xmath95 except for @xmath142 in ( b ) .",
    "thus , tuning @xmath62 non - adiabatically across resonance , when @xmath103 and @xmath104 , may cause population of excited bands .",
    "finally , in order to discuss on what grounds the third order strong coupling expansion may be applied , we have compared the phase diagrams of fig .",

    "as pointed out in the introduction , coupled two - level atoms in optical lattices were first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , considering two optical lattices driving a raman transition in @xmath0 atoms . by tuning the relative phase between the two lattices",
    ", it was demonstrated that the hopping coefficient in the corresponding bose - hubbard hamiltonian could attain negative as well as positive values .",
    "furthermore , due to the phase factor in the wannier expansion ( [ wanexp ] ) , it follows that the coherence in a superfluid state is different depending on the sign of the hopping coefficient .",
    "in particular , if the phase difference between consecutive wannier functions in ( [ wanexp ] ) is @xmath2 the superfluid state was termed antiferromagnetic , while a zero phase difference characterizes ferromagnetic superfluid states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was also predicted that ballistic expansion of an antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic superfluid state would render dissimilar time - of - flight measurements .",
    "although , in principle , measuring the atomic population inversion will determine the character of the superfluid states , in this section we analyze the corresponding time - of - flight scenario in our model .",
    "in other words , we investigate if the different phase modulation of the superfluid states is sufficient for separating between the two possible states .",

    "the nearest neighbor tunneling coefficient is positive , @xmath144 , while in ( b ) it is negative but with the same amplitude , @xmath146 .",
    "the figure evidences the swapping of internal state populations between positive and negative hopping .",
    "consequently , an internal state selective measurement distinguishes between antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic states and between mott `` + '' and mott `` - '' states . nonetheless , in the next subsection",

    "the other dimensionless parameters are as in fig .",
    "the peaks at @xmath150 are more pronounced in ( a ) than in ( b ) giving different interference patterns of the freely expanding atomic condensates .",

    "thus , we have a matter wave function as @xmath151\\ ] ] and study the impact of having @xmath152 when the wave function is freely evolving .",
    "the ballistically expanded wave function reads @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the time - of - flight time between release of the superfluid state till measurement of it .",
    "the total probability distribution @xmath155 or its constituent probability distributions @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) for the atomic internal states are assumed being detected after the ballistic expansion . for @xmath158 , the momentum distribution @xmath159 corresponding to @xmath160 in eq .",
    "( [ atstate ] ) , is encoded into the distribution @xmath161 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we display the square root of the momentum distributions of @xmath160 . in ( a )",
    "we use the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) ( and thus a constant phase between the wannier functions ) , while in ( b ) the parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) ( @xmath2 phase modulation between the neighboring wannier functions ) . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the even numbers of momenta are more strongly populated ; the peaks around @xmath162 are more distinct in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) than in ( b ) .",
    "note that for this example @xmath93 have the same strength in both cases , but the corresponding wannier functions ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) are different .",
    "thus , it is not only the phase @xmath163 which distinguishes the two cases .     ( a ) and @xmath164 ( b ) after a time - of - flight spreading @xmath165 . for solid lines ; @xmath147 , while for dotted lines ; @xmath145 , and in both cases @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this set of parameters give @xmath166 and @xmath167 respectively .",
    "the difference between solid and dotted lines derives from the different wannier functions of the two cases , but also from the phase factor @xmath168 in the wannier expansion ( [ wanexp ] ) .",

    "noticeable from the figure is that for positive hopping the distribution shows a super - structure with two local maxima for each period , not seen for @xmath119 .",
    "the great difference in probability amplitude between the internal atomic states in ( b ) derives from the fact that the two internal states are unequally populated due to the different detunings ; @xmath147 and @xmath145 .",
    "in this work we have presented an analysis of a gas of coupled two - level bosonic atoms in an one dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the spectrum of the single particle hamiltonian was found to possess peculiar characteristics originating from the coupled dynamics . in an earlier work",
    ", we demonstrated that pts can be obtained both for fermionic and bosonic atoms in the current model in the absence of atom - atom interaction @xcite . including scattering between the atoms , as in this paper",
    ", we identified the pt of ref .",
    "@xcite as a sign change in the site hopping parameter .",
    "the corresponding pt was shown to be between distinguishable mott or superfluid states , characterized by an imbalance of the population of internal atomic states .",
    "moreover , a thorough analysis about the effect of a positive or a negative nearest neighbor tunneling coefficient was given , focusing on time - of - flight detection of the condensate .",
    "the model can be generalized to two and three dimensions , and due to the anomalous dispersions found also in higher dimensions  @xcite , the corresponding phase diagrams is believed to show similar structures . however , in higher dimensions the strong coupling expansion method utilized in this work is supposed to give less reliable results , and other approaches would then be preferable .",
    "the imposed approximations and their validity regimes were studied .",
    "the present paper restrict the analysis to regimes where these approximations are justified .",
    "however , it is expected that new phenomena will occur beyond such limitations , not encountered in the regular bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "for example , the nearest neighbor hopping may vanish , and consequently long range or semi - long range interaction might become important .",
    "we are currently investigating regimes outside single band and tight binding approximations by using different methods .",
    "these results are left for future publications .",
