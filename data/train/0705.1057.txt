    "we compare this shape with the experimental results ( topology , geometry ) .",
    "distinguishing between topologies is trivial .",
    "but , due to the variability of membrane fluctuations , we find that it is difficult to describe the geometrical characteristics ( e.g. contact angles for the mutant ommatidia , interface lengths , elongation of cells ) by quantitative measurements : one obtains more information by looking at the image ( ` eyeballing ' ) .",
    "quantitative measurements serve as a complement to the eyeballing when enough data are available ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : wildtype ] ) , not as replacement .",
    "we determine for each model which parameters do influence the shape of the cone cells ; for the other parameters , we choose reasonable values ( e.g. , a compromise between simulation speed and precision , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we assume that ( i ) the adhesion strength is determined by the presence of these cadherins : when the two of them are present ( i.e. at interfaces between cone cells ) , adhesion is thus stronger .",
    "mutants should be modeled by only changing existing parameters .",
    "we thus require that ( ii ) to model the _",
    "roi_-mutants , we only need to change the number of cone cells ; ( iii ) to model the cadherin mutant ommatidia , only the adhesion for the mutant cells should be changed ( i.e. diminished for deletion , increased for overexpression ) ; and ( iv ) all cells of a cell type that share the same mutation should be modeled using the same parameter values .",
    "a stronger adhesion between cells @xmath6 and @xmath7 is represented by a lower interfacial tension @xcite , @xmath8 , which is a constant depending only on the cell types of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we minimise the energy:@xmath9 @xmath10 is the length of the interface between cells @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath11 is the cell s area ( the 2d equivalent of volume ) , @xmath12 is the cell s preferred area ( target area ) , and @xmath13 is the area modulus ( a lower value allows more deviations from @xmath14 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath12 are inferred from the experimental pictures , with cone ( @xmath15 ) cells being smaller than primary pigment ( @xmath5 ) cells .",
    "we assume @xmath15-@xmath15 adhesion @xmath16 , mediated by both e- and n - cadherin , to be stronger than @xmath15-@xmath5 and @xmath5-@xmath5 adhesion , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are mediated by e - cadherin alone .",
    "we assume the latter two to be equal : @xmath19 .",
    "only three parameters need to be explored extensively : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath20 ) , and @xmath13 . the tensions @xmath2",
    "influence the cell shapes directly , whereas @xmath13 determines a cell s deviations from the target area .",
    "starting the simulations with a four - cell vertex ( a ) , we systematically find an incorrect topology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tension]a ) : the anterior and posterior @xmath15 cell touch . even if we force the correct one , where the polar and equatorial @xmath15 cell touch , it is unstable and decays into the incorrect one : the interfaces between the @xmath5 cells are under tension , and pull the polar and equatorial @xmath15 cells apart .",
    "to obtain the correct topology , we need another assumption : either that the adhesion between polar and equatorial @xmath15 cells is stronger ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tension]b ) ; or that the @xmath5 cells pull less on them ( by having a stronger adhesion , fig .",
    "[ fig : tension]c ) .",
    "still , the geometry is quite different from the experiments : notably the interface between the polar and equatorial @xmath15 cell is too short in simulations .",
    "besides , there is no experimental evidence to support these assumptions .",
    "another optimization strategy is to determine ( up to a prefactor ) the tensions of three interfaces a , b , d that meet in a vertex from the experimentally observed contact angles @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) by using @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we inject those tensions in the model . by construction",
    "we obtain the correct contact angles , and thus topology ; but the overall geometry ( especially the interface lengths ) differs considerably from observations ( results not shown ) .    for the mutant ommatidia , the requirements ( ii ) to ( iv ) mentioned above could not be satisfied with this model : there are too many cases where other parameters need to be changed as well .",
    "we conclude that this model is insufficient to coherently describe the experiments .    to obtain the observed shapes",
    ", it would certainly be possible to choose a tension for each individual interface .",
    "but if the tension was just an input parameter without biological basis , then the model would not be predictive , nor help to understand the differences between the cells .",
    "adhesion between two cells tends to extend their contact length ; it thus contributes negatively to the energy , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 : in agreement with intuition , a higher @xmath28 describes a stronger adhesion , while @xmath29 in absence of adhesion @xcite .",
    "this extension is compensated by an elastic cell cortex term , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the perimeter modulus , and @xmath32 is the target perimeter of cell @xmath6 .",

    "however , it is no longer an input parameter . a stronger adhesion ( high @xmath28 )",
    "decreases the tension : this will usually cause an extension of the perimeter , which increases this tension even more .",
    "we represent all adhesion terms as combinations of e- and n - cadherin mediated adhesion ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ) . in the wildtype , the adhesion between @xmath15 cells is mediated by both cadherins , so @xmath40 ; whereas all other interfaces only have e - cadherin , so @xmath41 .",
    "values of @xmath14 are estimated from pictures .",
    "the target perimeter @xmath42 ( expressed in units of @xmath43 ) should be larger for cells that deviate more from a circular shape , i.e. for the @xmath5 cells .",

    "both topologies are stable , i.e. they are local energy minima .    in the correct topology ,",

    "experimentally , deleting the e - cadherin of these cells does not induce any geometrical or topological change @xcite . both experiments and simulations",

    ", we can simulate different numbers of @xmath15 cells ( _ roi_-mutants ) ; the total size of the simulation lattice is adjusted accordingly .",
    "for one , two , three and five @xmath15 cells , only one topology is observed in experiments , and the same one in simulations ( ) .    for six @xmath15 cells , three topologies",
    "are observed experimentally ( fig .",
    "[ fig : roi]a - c ) . theoretically , there are two more possible equilibrium topologies for 6-cell aggregates , which are never observed although one of them has a smaller total interface length ( simulations using the surface evolver , s. cox , unpublished results 2004 ) .",

    "n - cadherin is only present on interfaces between @xmath15 cells , deletion means we set the adhesion between mutant and wildtype @xmath15 cells as @xmath48 ( mutant cells are denoted by lower case letters ) .",
    "we predict the correct topologies ( fig .  [ fig : ncad]a - f and i - n ) , most of which are the same as in the wildtype .",
    "we predict qualitatively the main geometrical differences between mutants and wildtype : ( i ) the length of the interfaces between mutant cells and wildtype @xmath15 cells decreases ; ( ii ) the contact angles change ; ( iii ) the interface length between the remaining wildtype @xmath15 cells increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ncad]a - b and i - j ) ; and ( iv ) the length of the central interface increases ( fig .",

    "to simulate it , it would seem natural to suppress @xmath38 at all interfaces , that is , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . with this assumption",

    "since e - cadherin overexpression in @xmath5 cells rarely induces geometrical or topological changes @xcite , we do not change their adhesion values .",

    "when surface tension is a constant model parameter , only modified by adhesion , the surface mechanics are soap - bubble - like : minimization of the interfaces with cell type dependent weights @xcite .",
    "this model proves to be insufficient here .",
    "however , in studies focussing on larger aggregates ( @xmath62 to @xmath63 cells ) @xcite , constant surface tension was sufficient to explain tissue rounding and cell sorting , and even _ dictyostelium _ morphogenesis @xcite .",
    "this constant tension model catches two important features of tissues of adherent cells : first , cells tile the space without gaps or overlap ; second , the interface between cells is under ( positive ) tension , which implies for instance that three - cell vertices are stable , unlike four - cell ones , @xcite and thus severely constrains the possible topologies @xcite .    in the present example of retina development ,",
    "we show that interfacial tension should be variable , as described in a second model @xcite .",
    "tension results from a adhesion - driven extension of cell - cell interfaces , balanced by an even larger cortical tension ( eq .  ) .",

    "it requires more free parameters ; but they are tested against many more experimental data ; and their origins , signs and variations are biologically relevant @xcite .    adding more refinements ( and thus more free parameters )",
    "would be easy , but does not seem necessary to describe the equilibrium shape of ommatidial @xmath15 cells .",
    "the parameters should not be taken as quantitative predictions , since _ in vivo _ biophysical measurements to compare them to are lacking .      by adjusting a set of @xmath64 independent free parameters in this variable tension model",
    ", we obtain topological and geometrical agreement between the simulations and the pictures of @xmath65 different situations : the wildtype ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wildtype ] ) , the six topologies observed in the _ roi_-mutants ( fig .",
    "[ fig : roi ] and ) ; as well as the nine cadherin deletion mutants ( figs .  [ fig : ncad]a - f , [ fig : nocad ] ) by setting the corresponding parameter to zero .",
    "we also simulate @xmath66 cadherin overexpression mutants , by re - adjusting the corresponding parameter ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ncad]g , h , [ fig : ecad ] ) : adhesion is increased .",
    "the strongest increases are found when two overexpressing cells touch : this corresponds to the idea that the adhesion strength depends on the availability of cadherin molecules in both adhering cells .",
    "we found two cases where a mutation does not seem to change the adhesion strength : first , when deleting e - cadherin from one @xmath15 cell , its adhesion with a normal @xmath15 cell is unchanged ( fig .  [",
    "fig : nocad]d ) ; second , we rarely observed shape changes in e - cadherin overexpressing @xmath5 cells in experiments ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    indeed , while a linear relation between cadherin expression and adhesion strength has been found _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite , this need not be true _ in vivo _ , since cells have many more ways to regulate protein levels .",
    "these exceptions , thus , do not contradict the conclusion that the shapes observed in mutants are the effect of altered adhesion : an increase in the case of overexpression , a decrease in the case of deletion .      in the variable tension model , the perimeter modulus @xmath31 and the target perimeter @xmath42 reflect the role of the cortical cytoskeleton .",
    "the target perimeter is always smaller than the perimeter , therefore the interfacial tension @xmath37 ( eq .  ) is always positive , else the cell would be unstable and fall apart or disappear .",
    "the cortex of the simulated cells is contractile , and generates tension .",
    "this tension depends on the perimeter @xmath5 of the cell , which length depends on the cell s shape , which in turn depends on the tension : there is a feedback between tension and shape , and thus between each cell and its neighbours .    to understand the effect of this feedback , let us consider the wildtype ommatidium .",
    "we assume that the four @xmath15 cells have equal adhesion properties .",
    "the tension at the interfaces between the two @xmath5 cells pulls at the polar and equatorial @xmath15 cell .",
    "when the tension is constant , these cells will therefore be pulled apart ( fig .  [",
    "fig : tension]a ) : the cells do not react on their deformation . when the tension , however , depends on the cell s perimeter , pulling at those cells deforms them , and increases their tension : energy minimization thus requires that they stay in contact .",
    "the prediction that cytoskeletal contractility is essential for the establishment of cell shape should be tested , e.g. by treating the cells with cytoskeletal inhibitors @xcite , or genetically modifying the cytoskeleton . since the cytoskeleton has multiple functions that could interfere with adhesion ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , the results will be difficult to interpret .",
    "preliminary experimental results ( not shown ) do indicate that genetically disturbing rho - family gtpases influences the cell shape .",
    "the role of the cytoskeleton has been confirmed in various tissues and organisms ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "we here present a computational framework able to test this hypothesis , which can be extended to other tissues , ranging from patterns of few cells to large - scale aggregates .",
    "retinas were stained and analyzed as described in @xcite and @xcite . in short",

    "the effect of eliminating or overexpressing cadherin molecules was studied in mosaic retinas composed of wild - type and mutant cells ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we examined more than five retinas in each experiment .",
    "thus at least several hundreds of ommatidia ( @xmath67 ) were examined for the wildtype and each mutation , except the e- and n - cadherin overexpression , in which case approximately @xmath68 ommatidia were examined each .",
    "some pictures used for the analysis were published previously @xcite .",
    "the cellular potts model @xcite is a standard algorithm to simulate variable cell shape , size and packing @xcite .",
    "its use in biology is motivated by the capability to handle irregular , fluctuating interfaces ( c.f .",

    "each cell is defined as a certain set of pixels , here on a 2d square lattice ; their number defines the cell area @xmath69 .",
    "the cell shapes change when one pixel is attributed to one cell instead of another .",
    "our field of simulation for one ommatidium is a hexagon with sides of approximately @xmath68 pixels ( its surface is @xmath70 pixels , about the same as in experimental pictures ) .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions , as if we were simulating an infinite retina with identical ommatidia .",
    "initially , the whole hexagon is filled with cells , approximately at the right positions ( ) .",

    "<S> two cadherin types , e- and n - cadherin , are expressed in different cells : all interfaces bear e - cadherin , while n - cadherin is present only at interfaces between the four cone cells ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> cadherin - containing adherens junctions form a zone close to the apical cell surface , allowing the retina epithelium to be treated as a 2d tissue . in the wildtype and in _ </S>",
    "<S> roi_-mutant ommatidia with two to six cone cells , these cone cells assume a packing ( or topology , that is , relative positions of cells ) strikingly similar to that of a soap bubble cluster . when cadherin expression is changed in a few or all of the cells , </S>",
    "<S> the topology can change . </S>",
    "<S> more frequently , only the geometry ( individual cell shapes , contact angles at the vertices , interface lengths ) changes .    </S>",
    "<S> the soap films between bubbles are always under a positive tension , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this surface tension describes the energy cost of a unit of interface between bubbles , and drives their packing . at equilibrium , in a 2d foam layer , </S>",
    "<S> soap bubbles meet by three at each vertex , since four - bubble vertices are unstable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , since @xmath2 is constant and the same for all interfaces , bubble walls meet at equal ( _ i.e. _ 120@xmath3 ) angles . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the surface energy ( or rather the perimeter energy , for a 2d foam ) is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total perimeter of soap films . </S>",
    "<S> the foam reaches equilibrium when it minimises @xmath5 ( since @xmath2 is constant ) , balanced by another constraint fixing each bubble s area .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that cells minimize their surface , like soap bubbles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the surface mechanics of bubbles are quite simple , they can easily be described in a model . however , calculating the equilibrium shape of a cluster of more than four bubbles is difficult @xcite ; for this purpose , we use a numerical method @xcite , in order to test if cell patterning is based on surface minimization . here , the only biological ingredient is differential adhesion @xcite : an interface between two cells has a constant tension , that is lower when the adhesion is stronger @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> cells , however , differ greatly from bubbles , both in their membrane and internal composition . </S>",
    "<S> surface tension has been shown to be determined up to a large extent by the cortical cytoskeleton @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> adhesive cells have a tendency to increase their contact interfaces @xcite , not to minimize them . </S>",
    "<S> lecuit and lenne @xcite recently reviewed a large number of experiments , and show that a cell s surface tension results from the opposite actions of adhesion and cytoskeletal contraction . </S>",
    "<S> these are the ingredients of a second model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to find out if the observed cell packings and shapes can be described with one of these models , based on the knowledge we have from the experiments . with minimal and realistic assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> only the second model reproduces the topology and geometry of the wildtype and mutant ommatidia .    </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the competition between adhesion and cell cortex tension is needed to describe this specific cell pattern . </S>",
    "<S> we thus confirm and refine the conclusion that surface mechanics are involved in the establishment of cell topology and geometry . </S>",
    "<S> adhesion plays an important role therein , but its role can only be understood when taking into account its effect on the cortical cytoskeleton . </S>"
