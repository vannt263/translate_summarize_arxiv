    "owing to its ability to essentially preserve the stoichiometry of targets during evaporation , pulsed - laser deposition  ( pld ) is often used for the growth of materials with a complex composition , particularly oxides such as high - tc superconductors , ferroelectrics and manganites@xcite . when performed under ultra - high vacuum conditions pld",
    "is also suitable for the epitaxy of metals@xcite , although it is seldom used for that purpose .",
    "there are two main differences between pld and thermal deposition ( td ) concerning the epitaxy of metals .",
    "the first difference is the possibility to force layer - by - layer growth in some cases@xcite , which is a positive aspect .",
    "this fact arises from the several orders of magnitude higher instantaneous deposition rate during the laser pulse duration and from the increased kinetic energy of the ejected species ( up to several ev ) as compared with td@xcite .",
    "the second aspect is to potentially induce some intermixing at interfaces@xcite , which may be a drawback to reach certain physical properties depending on the smoothness of interfaces .",
    "evidence of an increased tendency of intermixing at interfaces in structures grown by pld versus td has been given previously by x - ray diffraction@xcite , and it is generally thought to result from the energy carried by the atoms or ions evaporated from the target and heated upon further interaction with the laser in the plume@xcite . here",
    "we report on the growth by pld and the resulting magnetic and magneto - optical ( mo ) properties of epitaxial au / co / au trilayers , motivated by the observed perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in td grown@xcite or electrodeposition(ed)@xcite co / au(111 ) films capped with various materials .    in this work",
    "the au surface used as substrate is a thin ( 111 ) film deposited on a buffer layer of refractory metal [ mo(110 ) ] epitaxially grown on sapphire @xmath1 .",
    "for this particular set and order of elements ( _ i.e. _ , co deposited on au ) we evidence by scanning tunneling microscopy some intermixing at the au / co interface , inducing a layer - by- layer growth for co as compared to a two - atomic - layer- high - island growth for td .",
    "interestingly , despite the intermixing ferromagnetic behavior is found at room temperature for coverings starting at 1 atomic layer ( al ) .",
    "an easy axis of magnetization is found perpendicular to the plane for co coverings between 1 and 5 al , with magnetic anisotropy constants similar to their td or ed counterparts , however with a much lower coercivity .",
    "the spectroscopic magneto - optical activity of the films has also been measured and modeled .",
    "the samples were grown by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) under ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) inside a three - chamber setup@xcite . the first chamber is devoted to preparation and analysis .",
    "it is equipped with a heater for sample degassing up to 800 @xmath2c , a sputtering gun and an auger electron analyzer .",
    "the base pressure is @xmath3 torr .",
    "the second chamber is the deposition chamber .",
    "it is equipped with a reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) setup , a quartz microbalance , and a sample heating similar to that of the first chamber .",
    "the base pressure is @xmath4 torr and in the @xmath5 torr range during laser deposition . a third chamber is dedicated to scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) with a room temperature ( rt ) omicron-1 setup ( base pressure @xmath6 torr ) . a nd - yag laser with a pulse duration and a frequency was used .",
    "the targets are first mechanically polished and then surface - cleaned through laser ablation until no gas contaminant is found on the target , as controlled by auger spectroscopy .",
    "the targets are cleaned at the same fluence as that used during the growth  ( about @xmath7{j / cm^2}$ ] ) .",
    "this sequence is chosen for each element just above the evaporation threshold , so as both to avoid the formation of droplets@xcite and to minimize the energy carried by evaporated individual atoms or ions@xcite . under these conditions",
    "the typical growth rate on the sample is 1 / s .",
    "more details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "hysteresis loops were carried out by means of a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer at low and rt .",
    "the magneto - optical ( mo ) polar response of the samples was studied experimentally in the spectral range from 1.4 to @xmath8{ev}$ ] , using a spectrometer described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we used commercial sapphire@xmath1 wafers with a miscut angle smaller than @xmath9 . a @xmath10-thick buffer layer of mo@xmath11",
    "was first deposited following an optimized procedure@xcite .",
    "its surface is single - crystalline and displays @xmath12-wide terraces separated by monoatomic steps .",
    "the steps separation and orientation are determined by the miscut of sapphire , which is uniform on a two - inch wafer , however varies from one wafer to another .",

    "it is atomically - flat with the usual @xmath16 reconstruction of au@xcite .",

    "the distribution of island lateral size is quickly bimodal ( b - c ) owing to the combination of homogeneous nucleation by adatom aggregation and heterogeneous nucleation on the au(111 ) defects @xcite .",
    "the growth in this sub - atomic - layer range dramatically differs from the case of td , for which the islands are 2 al - high and nucleate almost solely at the elbows of the au herringbone reconstruction@xcite , with a random 0.02 nm corrugation on the top of the islands owing to the large mismatch between co and au@xcite . here ,",
    "stripe - like areas of two different heights are observed on the top of the 1 al - high co islands , as the zoom of a selected area in ( b ) shows ( note that the vertical scale in this area has been optimized to better display the top part of the islands ) .",
    "this feature points to some degree of intermixing between co and au as previously observed in pld deposited systems@xcite . as above mentioned",
    ", the interfacial intermixing in pld is a result of the energy carried by the atoms or ions evaporated from the target and heated upon further interaction with the laser in the plume@xcite .",
    "although we set the laser fluence just above the evaporation threshold , tails in the energy distribution or hot spots in the laser beam may create a small fraction of atoms or ions carrying a few ev or more .",
    "notice that interfacial intermixing is not a systematic feature of pld , as we did not observe such inhomogeneities in other systems , e.g. fe@xcite or co deposited on w or mo(110 ) .",
    "the higher bonding energy of the latter with respect to au may prevent the intermixing .",
    "the growth mode of further co layers proceeds close to a layer - by - layer fashion , with a morphology and inter - island distances at 4 al of approximately 20 nm , very similar to those obtained with td@xcite .",
    "thus the topography of pld - grown films a few al thick is similar to their td - grown counterparts , except for some intermixing at the bottom interface .",

    "magnetization characterization was performed on samples similar to those presented above , however immediately capped with a 2 nm thick au layer for protection against contamination  ( , with no stm investigation ) .",
    "the magnetization reversal of 1 , 3 and 5 al - thick co samples was studied by means of squid magnetometry , under successively in - plane and perpendicular magnetic fields , at low ( ) and rt ( ) .",
    "surprisingly , ferromagnetic behavior is found in all the pld films at rt for co coverings starting at 1 al grown .",
    "this is an striking result since td films of nominal thickness 1.5 al and below are not ferromagnetic at rt@xcite .",
    "the lower ferromagnetic critical thickness found in our pld films stems from the different growth mode observed between both techniques .",
    "as above mentioned , for td films co nucleates in the form of isolated 2 al - thick islands in relation to the herringbone reconstruction of au(111)@xcite , forming crystallites of ultimately 6 - 10 nm in diameter@xcite , which remain superparamagnetic until percolation occurs around 1.6 ml@xcite . on the other hand , in our case pld leads to 1 al - high co islands at the early stages of growth , with larger lateral extends as compared to td films ( irregularly shaped islands up to 25 nm long are found at coverings around 0.72 al as shown in ( c ) ) , with percolation starting at submonoatomic coverings , and thus favoring the observed ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "the accuracy of saturation magnetization @xmath21 measurements using squid on magnetic thin films is subject to several factors , including error on the estimation of the volume of the magnetic films and background diamagnetic signals that must be subtracted .",
    "after correction of the measured data , saturation magnetization values close to the bulk value ( @xmath22{a / m}$ ] ) were found for the 3 and 5 al - thick co films , whereas a reduction around @xmath23{\\%}$ ] was found for the 1 al - thick film owing to the above mentioned interdiffusion of co and au , being this effect specially important in the low thickness regime .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath24{\\%}$ ] remanence along the direction perpendicular to the plane and the almost closed loops in - the - plane demonstrate a full perpendicular anisotropy for all the coverings and measurement temperatures , as shown in and .",
    "we analyze the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) at low temperature to access the values in the fundamental state .",
    "the density of mae was computed from the hysteresis loops along the perpendicular direction as @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting values are summarized in",
    ". the mae increases at low thickness , consistently with the picture of a dominant contribution of interface and/or magneto - elastic terms@xcite .",
    "concerning the easy axis of magnetization , the coercivity depends only weakly on the thickness .",
    "it decreases from around at low temperature to typically at rt .",
    "this sharp decrease with temperature is common for ultrathin films because the activation volumes involved in nucleation or activation processes underlying magnetization reversal@xcite are small as they scale with the thickness of the film@xcite .",
    "thermal activation is therefore much enhanced compared to bulk materials .",
    "previously au / co / au films had been extensively prepared using td@xcite and more recently with ed@xcite .",
    "both exhibit perpendicular anisotropy up to about ten al of co. their total mae has been measured mostly for films 5 al and thicker . for 5 al figures in the range",
    "have been given@xcite .",
    "this is roughly double the mae of 5 al - pld - grown films ( ) . this reduced value for our films may result from the intermixing at their lower interface .",
    "comparison at lower thicknesses based on extrapolation using published values of volume and surface energies may be hazardous and thus is not discussed here , although a similar reduction would be expected .",
    "the case of coercivity is more striking .",
    "the coercivity at rt of 3 - 5 al td or ed films are typically in the range 35 - 80 mt depending on the preparation conditions@xcite .",
    "this is more than one order of magnitude higher than for our pld films , an effect which obviously can not be ascribed solely to the @xmath26{\\%}$ ] decreased mae .",
    "instead we ascribe this to the difference of growth modes , as it was done for the early onset of ferromagnetic behavior . in td and ed the growth",
    "initially proceeds by the formation of 2 al - high islands .",
    "this induces a significant roughness that may be responsible for the high coercivity , whereas the initial al - growth with pld yields smoother films , topographically and obviously magnetically .",
    "this allows the occurrence of ferromagnetism however still associated with a high coercivity as the domain wall propagation is hindered between islands .",
    "already at 1 al pld films combine both ferromagnetism and a low coercivity owing to the initial growth mode in 1 al - high islands .",
    "let us summarize the discussion of the relationship between the growth - modes - related microstructure and magnetic properties .",
    "owing to the intermixing - induced initial growth mode as 1 al - islands , pld films compared to td or ed films have ferromagnetic ordering already at 1 al , a mae reduced by @xmath27 @xmath26{\\%}$ ] and a coercivity more than one order of magnitude lower .",

    "the magneto - optical ( mo ) properties of au / co / au trilayers and au / co multilayers grown by td as a function of the co thickness have been extensively studied@xcite .",
    "visnovsk et al.@xcite showed that the mo response of these systems in the thin film limit is given by the sum of one independent plus one linearly dependent term on the co film thickness .",
    "they ascribed the independent term to different au / co interface effects , such as au - co mismatch driven stress , lattice defects , au - co electronic orbital hybridization and intermixing at the interface@xcite .",
    "more recently , hamrle et al.@xcite studied specifically the contribution of co / au interfaces to the mo response of au / co / au trilayers , and concluded that the most important part of the interface contribution arises from intrinsic properties of the interface itself , i.e. , from the au - co electronic hybridization .",

    "is observed for the trilayers with 1 and 2 al thick co films , exhibiting values smaller than expected for such co thickness considering bulk mo constants@xcite , in agreement with previous reports@xcite . in principal , the mo response of both au / co interfaces in the trilayers can be described by the measured mo response of the trilayer with a 2 al thick co film , since , as above mentioned , the mo response can be ascribed to short range au - co hybridization effects involving only the atomic layers closer to the interface , and in this case also some short range degree of intermixing as observed with stm . thus , under the ultra thin film approach@xcite , the ellipticity of the trilayers with 3 , 4 and 5 al layers thick co films can be simulated by adding the ellipticity of 1 , 2 and 3 co thick continuous films respectively , addressing the inner part of the co film unaffected by the interface , and the ellipticity of the trilayer with a 2 al thick co film , addressing the interface effects . the optical constants for mo , co and au",
