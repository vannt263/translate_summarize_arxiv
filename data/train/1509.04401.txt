    "the electronic structure of a single @xmath0he atom is among the simplest in the periodic table of elements .",
    "likewise , the atomic interactions in liquid and solid helium can be reproduced accurately with simple analytical functions that solely depend on the distance between particles taken in pairs .",
    "examples of successful @xmath0he@xmath0he interaction models include the lennard - jones and aziz - type semiempirical potentials .",
    "@xcite yet , under conditions of large pressures and strain deformations the interparticle interactions become more complex due to the strong electronic repulsion experienced by neighboring atoms .",
    "consequently , pairwise potentials , which work reasonably well under near - equilibrium conditions , turn out to be unreliable .",
    "this is , for instance , the case of the aziz - ii potential ,  @xcite which at high pressure provides too repulsive atomic forces and a significant overestimation of the @xmath0he molar volume and bulk modulus .",
    "@xcite    a recently proposed straightforward way to correct for such modeling drawbacks consists in modifying the repulsive part of standard pairwise potentials by means of an exponential attenuation factor .  @xcite this possibility has already been explored in highly compressed solid @xmath0he  @xcite and molecular hydrogen  @xcite with quantum monte carlo simulations , producing equations of state which are in very good agreement with experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the use of modified pairwise potentials in very dense crystals poses a series of issues and open questions .",
    "for instance , a surprisingly small variation of the kinetic energy upon increasing pressure have been reported in works  [ ] and  [ ] , and , owing to the lack of experimental data in the thermodynamic regime of interest , it remains to be demonstrated whether such predictions can be fully ascribed to genuine quantum nuclear effects or not .",
    "also , pairwise potentials are in general not recommended for the study of elasticity in hcp crystals at high pressure since they inevitably lead to null values of the cauchy discrepancy ( defined as the difference between the two elastic constants @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) , in contrast to what is observed in experiments .",
    "@xcite    an alternative route to improve the description of quantum solids under extreme stress - strain conditions is to consider higher order terms , beyond pairwise additivity , in the approximation to the atomic interactions . in this context",
    ", several three - body interatomic models have already been proposed like , for instance , the axilrod - teller ( at ) , bruch - mcgee ( bm ) , and cohen - murrel ( cm ) potentials .",
    "@xcite however , improvements resulting from the use of those three - body interaction models so far have been reported to be only marginal .",
    "for instance , three decades ago loubeyre claimed , based on the outcomes of self - consistent phonon and classical monte carlo simulations , that the bm three - body interaction could bring into good agreement calculations and experiments performed on the equation of state of solid helium up to @xmath1  gpa .",
    "@xcite however , chang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown more recently that when either the bm or cm three - body potentials are considered in quantum monte carlo simulations the resulting @xmath0he molar volumes are significantly underestimated , already at few gpa .",
    "similar discouraging results have been reported also by other authors who have employed analogous three - body interaction models .",
    "@xcite    in this article , we present new work done on the modeling of three - body interactions in highly compressed solid helium up to pressures of @xmath5  gpa .",
    "we introduce a new set of bm potential parametrizations obtained from fits to _ ab initio _ energies and atomic forces calculated with the van der waals corrected density functional theory method due to grimme ( dft - d2 ) .",
    "@xcite we show that an overall improved description of the energy , elastic and structural properties of solid helium can be achieved with some of the introduced bm three - body interatomic potentials , when used in combination with pairwise potentials in quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "our work also brings new insight into the physics of quantum crystals at high pressure .",
    "for instance , we show that previously reported small variations of the kinetic energy , @xmath6 , and lindeman ratio , @xmath7 , in solid helium under pressure  @xcite are likely to be artifacts deriving from the use of incomplete atomic interaction models .",
    "moreover , we quantify the role of quantum nuclear effects on the estimation of the shear modulus , @xmath2 , and conclude that they become secondary when pressure is raised .",
    "finally , at @xmath8  gpa we find that the agreement between our @xmath2 results and experiments starts to worsen .",
    "therefore , we argue that higher order many - body terms in the expansion of the atomic interactions probably are necessary in order to describe elasticity in dense solid helium more accurately .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we outline the employed computational methods and provide the technical details in our calculations . in sec .  [",
    "sec : potentialfit ] , we explain the fitting strategy that we have followed to obtain the new set of three - body interaction models .",
    "next , we present our results on the equation of state , kinetic energy , and structural and elastic properties in solid helium , together with some discussion . finally , we summarize our main findings in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we used the density functional theory method including van der waals corrections due to grimme ,  @xcite to compute the interactions and forces between helium atoms in the hexagonal close package ( hcp ) crystal structure , from equilibrium up to a pressure of @xmath5  gpa .",
    "( details of our ab initio dft - d2 calculations can be found in elsewhere ,  @xcite hence we highlight here only the main technical features . )",
    "subsequently , we found a series of three - body interaction models that , when used in combination with the pairwise aziz - ii potential  @xcite ( hereafter denoted as @xmath9 ) , reproduced very closely the obtained dft - d2 results .",
    "the details of our fitting strategy are comprehensively explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : potentialfit ] .",
    "next , we performed diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) simulations in which the new three - body interaction models were used to calculate the energy , structural , and elastic properties of solid helium under pressure . in this section",
    ", we explain the specific implementation of the dft - d2 and dmc methods in our work .",
    "we chose the generalized gradient approximation to density functional theory proposed by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( gga - pbe ) ,  @xcite as is implemented in the vasp package .",
    "@xcite van der waals interactions were taken into account by adding an attractive energy term to the exchange - correlation energy of the form @xmath10 ( where indexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 label different particles , @xmath13 is a constant , and a damping factor is introduced at short distances to avoid divergences ) .",
    "@xcite the projector - augmented - wave technique  @xcite was employed to represent the core electrons since this approach has been shown to provide very accurate total energies and is computationally very efficient .",
    "@xcite the electronic wave functions were represented in a plane - wave basis truncated at @xmath14  ev , and for integrations within the first brillouin zone ( bz ) we employed dense @xmath15-centered @xmath16-point grids of @xmath17 . by using these parameters we obtained interaction energies that were converged to within @xmath18  k per atom .",
    "geometry relaxations were performed by using a conjugate - gradient algorithm that kept the volume of the unit cell fixed and permitted variations of its shape .",
    "the imposed tolerance on the atomic forces was @xmath19  ev@xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "with such a dft - d2 setup we calculated the total energy and shear modulus in solid @xmath0he in the volume interval @xmath22  @xmath23/atom .    additionally , we computed the vibrational phonon spectrum in solid @xmath0he at eight different volumes by means of the `` direct approach '' . in the direct approach the force - constant matrix",
    "is directly calculated in real - space by considering the proportionality between atomic displacements and forces when the former are sufficiently small .",
    "@xcite in this case , large supercells have to be simulated in order to guarantee that the elements of the force - constant matrix have all fallen off to negligible values at their boundaries , a condition that follows from the use of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite once the force - constant matrix is obtained , we fourier - transform it to obtain the phonon spectrum at any @xmath24-point .",
    "the quantities with respect to which our dft - d2 phonon calculations need to be converged are the size of the supercell and atomic displacements , and the numerical accuracy in the atomic forces .",
    "the following settings were found to fulfill our convergence requirement of correct zero - point energy corrections to within @xmath18  k / atom :  @xcite @xmath25 supercells ( that is , @xmath26 repetitions of the hcp unit cell containing a total of @xmath27 atoms ) , and atomic displacements of @xmath28    . regarding the calculation of the atomic forces with vasp",

    ", we used a guiding wave function , @xmath30 , that accounts simultaneously for the atomic periodicity and bose - einstein quantum symmetry in @xmath0he crystals .",
    "this model wave function is expressed as  @xcite @xmath31 where indexes @xmath32 and @xmath33 run over particles and perfect lattice positions , respectively . in previous works",

    "we note that our choice of the guiding function was motivated by an interest in studying the possible effects of quantum atomic exchanges on the energetic and elastic properties of dense helium .",
    "however , we realised by direct comparison to the results obtained with non - symmetric wave function models in analogous dmc simulations ,  @xcite that such effects can be totally neglected in practice .",
    "the technical parameters in our calculations were set to ensure convergence of the total energy per particle to less than @xmath18  k. the value of the mean population of walkers was @xmath46 and the length of the imaginary time - step ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48  k@xmath21  .",

    "the reason for our choice was that we wanted to reproduce simultaneously the energy and elastic properties in highly compressed solid @xmath0he .",

    "namely , on one side , phonons can be calculated from the variation of the atomic forces upon the displacement of atoms away from their equilibrium positions , and , on the other side , elastic constants can be estimated from the slope of specific acoustic branches in the vicinity of the @xmath15 point in reciprocal space ( that is , in the @xmath71 limit ) . therefore ,",

    "@xcite the gradient of the objective function was calculated analytically since otherwise numerical bias developed that impeded convergence . actually , the typical size of the involved atomic forces is very small , of the order of @xmath82  ev /   , hence they needed to be calculated very precisely .",
    "the minimizations were stopped when all the gradients of the objective function in absolute value were smaller than @xmath83 .",
    "typically , this was achieved within @xmath84 minimization loops when starting from a reasonable initial guess of the @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 parameters ( e.g. , the original values proposed by bruch and mcgee  [ ] ) .    [ tab : bmparameters ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now comment on the @xmath85 results shown in fig .",
    "all the values have been obtained considering the atoms fixed on their perfect lattice positions , that is , totally neglecting likely quantum nuclear effects ( hence the employed subscript ) .",
    "this is done for the sake of comparison since it is technically difficult to account for quantun nuclear effects in the dft - d2 calculations in an exact manner , that is , to go beyond the quasiharmonic approximation .",
    "nevertheless , later on this section we will show that according to our dmc simulations quantum nuclear effects become secondary on @xmath2 at high pressure . as is observed in the figure ,",
    "the dft - d2 curve is in overall good agreement with the ambient temperature measurements performed by zha and collaborators .",
    "@xcite again , these findings justify our choice of the benchmark data for the modeling of three - body interactions . regarding the performance of the original and new three - body bm potentials",
    ", we find that in general they reproduce quite satisfactorily the experimental data obtained at volumes larger than @xmath86  @xmath23/atom ( i.e. , @xmath3  gpa ) .",
    "this is especially true in the @xmath73(bm - f ) case where , as expected ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : potentialfit ] ) , the calculated shear modulii follow closely those obtained with the dft - d2 method .",
    "however , at volumes smaller than @xmath86  @xmath23/atom ( i.e. , @xmath87  gpa ) we find that the differences between the bm curves ( including the @xmath73bm - f case ) , on one side , and the dft - d2 results and experiments , on the other , become increasingly larger .",
    "we recall that the @xmath73(bm - e ) and @xmath73(bm - ef ) potentials provide a very good description of the equation of state and bulk modulus , whereas the @xmath73(bm - f ) potential does not .",
    "this appreciation let us to conclude that is very difficult to provide simultaneously a good account of the energy and elastic properties in solid helium by using an effective three - body approach .",
    "higher order many - body contributions in the description of the atomic interactions probably are necessary in order to attain an overall correct description of solid helium at high pressure . as for the pairwise potentials , @xmath9 performs very similarly to the @xmath73(bm - f ) model , as we have also noted in the total energy ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : energy ] ) and bulk modulus cases . the @xmath9(bc ) model , however",
    ", remarkably fails in reproducing the variation of the shear modulus under pressure .",
    "moreover , it predicts the occurrence of unrealistic mechanical instabilities ( i.e. , @xmath88 )  @xcite at small volumes .",
    "therefore , the use of the @xmath9(bc ) potential is strongly not recommended for the simulation of solid helium at high pressure .    in order to quantify the importance of quantum nuclear effects on the calculation of the shear modulus",
    ", we carried out additional quantum dmc calculations ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : dmc ] and works  [ ] for details ) . to our surprise",
    ", we found that the quantum and classical shear modulii results are very similar .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath73(bm - f ) case the @xmath89 difference ( where subscript `` quantum '' means calculated with the dmc method ) amounts only to @xmath90  gpa at @xmath91  gpa .",
    "similar results were obtained also in the rest of @xmath9 and @xmath73 cases .",
    "we note that the sign of the differences is always positive , thus the inclusion of quantum nuclear effects tends to lower the classical @xmath2 values , although in a small fraction ( i.e. , @xmath92  % ) .",
    "this last finding appears to be consistent with conclusions presented in a recent quantum monte carlo study by borda _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite in which the ideal shear strength on the basal plane of hcp @xmath0he was found to behave analogously than in classical solids .",
    "in table  iii we summarise the performance of the analysed pairwise and three - body potentials in describing the energy , elastic and structural properties of solid @xmath0he at high pressure .",
    "a number of tips can be drawn from our results .",
    "first of all , the use of pairwise potentials in general is not recommended .",
    "these either fail to reproduce the equation of state and bulk modulus , i.e. , @xmath9 , or the kinetic energy , and structural and elastic features , i.e. , @xmath9(bc ) , in highly compressed quantum crystals . in this context , we urge to employ more versatile many - body interaction models .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the new three - body bm potentials introduced in this work , which represent an improvement with respect to previously reported similar models .",
    "overall , we recommend to consider the @xmath73(bm - e ) and @xmath73(bm - ef ) parametrizations in prospective simulation studies because they provide the most satisfactory general description of dense solid @xmath0he . indeed ,",
    "those interaction models can be safely employed , for instance , in atomistic high-@xmath93 high-@xmath94 simulations ( either classical or quantum ) , which are of relevance to planetary sciences .",
    "nevertheless , we must note that it remains a challenge to attain a precise description of elasticity at high pressure by using effective three - body potentials , thus in this latter case consideration of higher order many - body terms appears to be necessary .",
    "importantly , we have shown that the addition of three - body forces corrects for the artificially large atomic delocalization found with modified pairwise potentials based on exponential attenuation factors .",
    "nevertheless , given the lack of structural and kinetic energy measurements performed at high pressure , we have not been able to quantify the accuracy of our @xmath7 and @xmath95 dmc results obtained with the @xmath73(bm - e ) and @xmath73(bm - ef ) potential models . in this regard , advanced computational studies in which both the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in the crystal were to be treated at the quantum level are highly desirable .",

    "<S> we present a new set of three - body interaction models based on the bruch - mcgee ( bm ) potential that are suitable for the study of the energy , structural and elastic properties of solid @xmath0he at high pressure . </S>",
    "<S> our _ ab initio _ three - body potentials are obtained from the fit to total energies and atomic forces computed with the van der waals density functional theory method due to grimme , and represent an improvement with respect to previously reported three - body interaction models . in particular , we show that some of the introduced bm parametrizations reproduce closely the experimental equation of state and bulk modulus of solid helium up to a pressure of @xmath1  gpa , when used in combination with standard pairwise interaction models in diffusion monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we find that recent predictions reporting a surprisingly small variation of the kinetic energy and lindeman ratio on quantum crystals under increasing pressure are likely to be artifacts produced by the use of incomplete interaction models . </S>",
    "<S> also , we show that the experimental variation of the shear modulus , @xmath2 , at @xmath3  gpa can be quantitatively described with the new set of three - body bm potentials . at higher pressures , however , the agreement between our @xmath2 results and experiments deteriorates and thus we argue that higher order many - body terms in the expansion of the atomic interactions probably are necessary in order to better describe elasticity in very dense solid @xmath0he . </S>"
