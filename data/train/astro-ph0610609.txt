    "the am cvn stars are a class of interacting binaries with ultracompact orbital periods ( @xmath0 , that is @xmath1 min ) , a white dwarf ( wd ) accretor , and a compact donor with a he dominated composition .",
    "these systems are their progenitor systems stellar evolutionary end - state .",
    "thus , they provide a forensic record of the binary evolution processes that formed their population",
    ". they will also be among the gravity wave ( gw ) sources probed by future space borne interferometer missions such as _ lisa_. determining how observations can constrain am cvn formation processes as well as developing expectations for this population s distribution of gw signal frequencies and amplitudes depends on the details and accuracy of both our population synthesis and stellar evolution theory for these systems .",
    "the population synthesis calculations of @xcite illustrates this point .",
    "these authors considered two formations channels for am cvn binaries , both involving a sequence of two common envelope events that place the remnant stellar cores close enough that gw emission can drive them into contact .",
    "the channels differ in the nature of the proto - donor prior to contact : either a non - degenerate he - burning star or a fully degenerate he wd . in their model , the formation channel determined which of two predetermined mass - radius ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) relations the donor is constrained to evolve along under mass loss .",
    "donors formed from he - stars are hotter and have larger radii , @xmath4 , at fixed mass , @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , as compared to systems with a wd donor , such systems lead to larger mass transfer rates , @xmath6 , at a given @xmath0 , evolve out to longer @xmath0 , and lead to a different distribution of gw signals .    while the @xcite study utilized a _",
    "donor @xmath2-@xmath3 relation for each formation channel , @xcite argued that even within each channel , there should be variations in donor properties .",
    "in particular , they examined the impact of variations in the donor s entropy ( or , equivalently , degeneracy ) at contact for wd channel am cvn systems .",
    "to calculate the donor s evolution during the am cvn phase , they utilized set of he - object @xmath2-@xmath3 relations parameterized additionally by the donor s specific entropy , @xmath7 , developed by @xcite and assumed the donor s evolve adiabatically .",
    "the results were to shift the distribution of wd channel am cvn systems off the fully degenerate track to higher @xmath6 at fixed @xmath0 and to shift the maximum @xmath0 in the population to longer periods .",
    "in particular , some of the wd channel systems overlapped with the expected locations of he - star channel systems .",
    "the @xcite calculations have several shortcomings : the donor s are still constrained to evolve along predefined @xmath2-@xmath3 tracks completely defined by the donor s @xmath7 at contact .",
    "these @xmath2-@xmath3 relations used were calculated assuming the donor s are fully convective and no treatment of the donor s thermal evolution was included .",
    "it is unclear whether the assumptions of adiabatic donor structure and evolution are valid during all portions of the am cvn phase .",
    "these models also do not allow predictions of the donor s light . and",
    ", finally , without full stellar models , accurate treatment of the important contact phase @xcite , during which time the @xmath6 rate grows from 0 to its fully developed rate , is not possible .",
    "to rectify this situation , we have calculated the evolution of wd channel am cvn systems from pre - contact to late times treating , for the first time , the donors within a full stellar structure theory .",
    "to do so , we developed a new henyey - style stellar evolution code base designed to be maximally flexible in terms of input physics used and in definition of the system of odes to be solved .",
    "we used the pure he equation of state developed by @xcite that treats the difficult region of partial pressure ionization and covers the wide range of parameter space needed to follow the donor s complete evolution .",
    "we calculated @xmath6 based on the prescriptions of @xcite and @xcite , allowing us to follow the binary s evolution during the phase of @xmath6 turn - on .",
    "below we discuss the new insights into am cvn evolution this improved donor treatment provides , both in terms of the binary s evolution and the donor s contribution to the binary s light .",
    "we find that am cvn evolution can be divided into 3 phases , illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : deloye_f1 ] . the am cvn binary s evolution initiates when the donor is brought into contact and @xmath6 begins increasing from zero .",
    "the first of our 3 phases , the @xmath6 turn - on phases , consists of evolution from the start of mass transfer up to @xmath6 maximum . during this phase , both @xmath4 and @xmath0 decrease . by the time @xmath6 reaches its maximum ,",
    "@xmath4 has begun increasing and the long - lived second phase where the donor evolves nearly adiabatically in response to mass loss is underway .",
    "finally at late times , the donor begins cooling and contracting once again , initiating the third phase of the system s evolution .",
    "the details of the first and third phases are new results , so we will focus here on providing a description of them .",
    "the salient features of the @xmath6 turn - on phase are the @xmath4 evolution and the growth rate of @xmath6 .",
    "the transition from donor contraction to expansion that occurs in this phase can be explained in terms of the donor s initial @xmath7 profile . as @xmath5 decreases , the pressure , @xmath8 , at fixed mass coordinate , @xmath9 , in the donor decrease , as does density , @xmath10 , there .",
    "this results in fixed mass points moving outward in radius under mass loss .",
    "this general trend towards expansion is counteracted by the fact that the mass lost also removes its own @xmath4 contribution .",
    "whether the remaining regions of the star expand enough to make up for this lost @xmath4 contribution determines whether the donor expands or contracts overall .    at fixed @xmath9 ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath4 evolution depends on @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the donor s central pressure .",
    "the @xmath4 changes are therefore dominated by the response of the outer layers . to determine if the donor should tend towards expansion or contraction ,",
    "it is sufficient to determine @xmath13 at fixed @xmath8 in the outer layers : if mass elements advected to lower @xmath8 arrive with higher @xmath10 than the element it replaces , @xmath4 will contract overall .",
    "one can show @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the local temperature , @xmath16 describes the background @xmath15 profile , @xmath17 describes the actual @xmath15 evolution of the advected element , and @xmath18 .    in general , @xmath19 , so that for @xmath4 to decrease with @xmath5 ,",
    "two requirements need to be met .",
    "the first is that @xmath20 ; i.e. , the outer layers can not be strongly degenerate .",
    "the second is for @xmath21 .",
    "the latter condition occurs in radiative layers under rapid mass loss ( i.e. when @xmath22 ) . the second condition dominates the donor s initial response ; that is , initially near their surface the donors have a very steep radiative @xmath7 profile . once @xmath6 has increased sufficiently so that advection is nearly adiabatically , the steep @xmath7 gradient leads to increasing @xmath10 at fixed @xmath8 as much lower entropy material replaces the removed layers .",
    "this produces the overall @xmath4 decrease .",
    "the contraction is eventually reversed one the layers with a steep @xmath7 gradient are removed , exposing the transition to the much more shallow @xmath7 profile that occurs deeper in the donor s outer layers .    during the turn - on phase , the @xmath6 growth rate depends on the evolution of @xmath23 .",
    "initially , at low @xmath6 , @xmath24 and @xmath6 grows exponentially with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 maximum is set by the @xmath6 needed to reverse the inward evolution of orbital separation driven by gw emission . in all cases",
    "considered , the maximum @xmath6 value is greater than the @xmath6 able to be supported if @xmath26",
    ". therefore @xmath27 eventually moves below the photosphere and the @xmath6 growth rate slows since @xmath27 is now probing the donor s interior @xmath10 profile , not the profile of an isothermal atmosphere .",
    "the first change in the slope of @xmath28 seen in fig [ fig : deloye_f1 ] is due to this effect .",
    "the later , rapid upturn in the @xmath6 growth rate is related to the evolution towards @xmath4 minimum .",
    "the increasing @xmath10 of the donor s surface layer caused by the increasingly adiabatic advection of the underlying lower-@xmath7 layers produces this rapid upturn in @xmath6 .",
    "less degenerate donors make contact at wider @xmath29 , and such systems have lower @xmath6 maxima since a lower @xmath6 is needed to compensate for the weaker gw emission of these systems .    by the time the system has passed its @xmath6 maximum , the donor is expanding adiabatically and",
    "the binary is now in what is typically thought of as the am cvn phase . in prior work on",
    "am cvn evolution , the donor s adiabatic evolution has been assumed to continue indefinitely .",
    "our more detailed calculations show that this is not the case and , generically , the donors eventually cool and contract .",
    "the reason for this is most easily described in terms of the evolution of two time scales : the donor s mass loss time , @xmath30 , and the donor s thermal time , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 const . and @xmath33 is the donor s central temperature .",
    "once @xmath5 is much less than the accretor mass , @xmath34 . during adiabatic expansion , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is calculated from the donor s evolution .    for typical values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "during the early portion of the adiabatic evolution phase , @xmath41 , but this inequality is eventually reversed due to this large negative @xmath42 value .",
    "this occurs for @xmath43 minutes .",
    "at this point , the donor begins shedding entropy and contracting . at late times",
    ", all evolution tracks collapse towards the fully degenerate track .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deloye_f3 ] .",
    "the donor s luminosity , @xmath44 , and effective temperature , @xmath45 , evolution also corresponds with the donor s evolutionary phases . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : deloye_f2 ] , initially both @xmath44 and @xmath45 decrease rapidly as the system evolves toward @xmath6 maximum . once in the adiabatic phase , both quantities plateau at a level set by the donor s initial @xmath7 profile . finally , once the donor s adiabatic evolution ends at long @xmath0 , both @xmath44 and @xmath45 begin decreasing more rapidly again .",
    "we can compare the amount of accretion light the donor sees to its own luminous output .",
    "the luminosity generated by the accretion flow is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the value of the binary s potential at the inner lagrange point and accretors surface , respectively . at almost all times , the accretion light irradiating the donor dominates the donor s own luminous output . to treat this effect , we performed calculations where we set the donor s outer boundary temperature to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the overall efficiency with which @xmath51 is converted to photons that end up being reprocessed in the donor s atmosphere , and @xmath29 is the binary orbital separation . here",
    "we define @xmath45 in terms of the donor s intrinsic @xmath44 , @xmath52 .",
    "the luminosity seen from the donor s surface , @xmath53 is then defined by @xmath54 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath53 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 is shown by the upper set of lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : deloye_f2 ] . as compared to the non - irradiated case ,",
    "@xmath53 can be increased significantly over @xmath44 for a large portion of the am cvn phase .",
    "overall , with @xmath56 , we expect donors to have @xmath53 in the range of @xmath57-@xmath58 and @xmath59 between 1000 - 5000 k for @xmath60 minutes",
    ". both quantities will be higher if @xmath50 is larger ."
