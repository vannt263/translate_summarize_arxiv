    "such regularization makes possible a perturbative expansion , respectively in @xmath6 for the thirring model and @xmath13 for the sine - gordon model ; it turned out that the coefficients of such series expansions can be explicitly computed ( in the case of the thirring coefficients this was possible thanks to the explicit formulas for the correlations of the massless thirring model given first in @xcite ) and they are _",

    "the issue of convergence , which was mentioned but not addressed in @xcite , is technically quite involved and crucial ; there are several physical examples in which order by order arguments without convergence lead to uncorrect prediction .    the search for a rigorous proof of coleman equivalence was the subject of an intense investigation in the framework of constructive qft , leading to a number of impressive results .",
    "in @xcite it was rigorously proven the equivalence between the _ massive _ sine - gordon model ( with mass @xmath17 large enough ) at @xmath18 and a thirring model with a large long - range interaction ; similar ideas were also used in @xcite .",
    "the properties of the _ massive _ sine - gordon model for @xmath19 were later on deeply investigated . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was proved that the model is stable if one adds a finite number , increasing with @xmath20 , of vacuum counterterms , while the full construction , through a cluster expansion , of the model was partially realized in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was also proved that the correlation functions are analytic in @xmath13 , for any @xmath21 .",
    "a proof of analyticity , only based on a multiscale analysis of the perturbative expansion , was first given in @xcite , for @xmath18 , and then extended in @xcite up to @xmath22 .    using the results in @xcite for a fixed finite volume , dimock @xcite was able finally to achieve a proof of coleman s equivalence , in the euclidean version of the models , _ for the case @xmath8 _ ; such a value is quite special as it corresponds to @xmath9 , that is the equivalence is with a _",
    "free _ massive fermionic system , without current - current interaction .",
    "such limitation was mainly due to the fact that the constructive analysis of interacting fermionic systems was much less developed at that time : indeed a rigorous construction of the massive thirring model in a functional integral approach has been achieved only quite recently @xcite .",
    "a more physically oriented research on coleman s equivalence was focused in recovering bosonization in the framework of the ( formal ) path - integral approach , @xcite .",

    "such computations are however based on formal manipulations of functional integrals ( with no cut - offs , hence formally infinite ) and it is well known that such arguments can lead to incorrect result ( see for instance the discussion in  1 in [ bfm ] ) .    in this paper",

    "this theorem proves coleman s equivalence .",
    "we remark that the relations between the sine - gordon parameters and the thirring parameters in are slightly different with respect to those in @xcite , for @xmath94 ; this is true in particular for the first equation , involving only quantities which have a physical meaning in the removed cutoff limit , if we express them in terms of @xmath5 , as coleman does .",
    "this is not surprising , as the relations between the physical quantities , like the critical indices @xmath95 , and the bare coupling depend on the details of the regularization , and in our renormalization group analysis the running coupling constants have a bounded but non trivial flow from the ultraviolet to the infrared scales . indeed , with a different regularization of the thirring model ( that is starting from a non local current - current interaction and performing the local limit after the limit @xmath96 ) , as in @xcite , one would get a simple relation between @xmath20 and @xmath5 .",
    "this new relation again is not equal to that of @xcite , but is in agreement with the regularization procedure of @xcite , see footnote 7 of @xcite .",
    "another important remark concerns the limit @xmath97 . in the case of sine - gordon model",
    ", one expects that , in this limit , there is exponential decrease of correlations ( implying the screening phenomenon in the coulomb gas interpretation ) , which is not compatible with convergence of perturbative expansion ( in this case the correlations would have a power decay as in the free theory ) . up to now , screening has been proved only for @xmath98 @xcite , but it is expected to be verified in all range of validity of the model ( @xmath21 ) , hence even around @xmath99 . however , if the interaction is restricted to a fixed finite volume , convergence is possible and we could indeed prove it , for @xmath100 ; in this paper , for simplicity , we give the proof only for @xmath101 , which is sufficient to state the main result .",
    "the situation for the massive thirring model is slightly different , because it has been shown @xcite that it is well defined in the limit @xmath97 and that its correlations decay at least as @xmath102 .",
    "hence , even if the power expansion in the mass can be convergent only if we fix the volume , the proof of coleman s conjecture strongly supports the related conjecture that even the sine - gordon model is well defined around @xmath99 in the infinite volume limit and has exponential decrease of correlations .    the proof is organized in the following way . in  [ sec3 ] we analyze the massless sine - gordon model with finite volume interaction and @xmath76 , extending the proof of analyticity in @xmath13 given in @xcite for the massive case in the infinite volume limit and @xmath103 .",
    "with respect to the technique used in @xcite , where only the case @xmath99 was analyzed , our method has the advantage that an explicit expression of the coefficients can be easily achieved ; this is probably possible even with the other method , but the proof was given only for @xmath103 and , as a consequence , the correlations in the model with @xmath99 were defined as the limit @xmath104 of those with @xmath103 .    in  [ sec3a ]",
    "we use the methods developed in @xcite to prove the analyticity in @xmath6 of the thirring model ; the explicit expressions of the coefficients are obtained in  [ sec4 ] , by using the explicit expression of the field correlation functions given in the appendix ( through the solution of a schwinger - dyson equation , based on a rigorous implementation of ward identities ) and by a rigorous implementation , in a rg context , of the point spitting procedure used in theoretical physics .",
    "we want to study the measure defined in  [ s1.2 ] in the limit of removed cutoff , @xmath105 . to this purpose , we consider the _ generating functional _ , @xmath106 , defined by the equation & & _ h , n(j , a , ) = p_h , n(d ) e^_n v ( ) + & & \\ { _ = 1 dj^_e^i_+ _ = 0,1 da^_(^ _ ) } where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are two - dimensional , external bosonic fields . then , given two non negative integers @xmath109 and @xmath110 , as well as two sets of labels @xmath111 and @xmath112 , together with two sets of two by two distinct points @xmath113 and @xmath114 , we consider the schwinger functions , defined by the equation k^(q , r;)_h , n ( , ; , ) ( 0,0 , )    if @xmath115 is small enough , @xmath76 and @xmath81 , if @xmath80 , or @xmath116 , if @xmath82 , the limit k^(q , r ; ) ( , ; , ) _",
