    "aluminium nitride is a material with a fascinating variety of applications spanning from optoelectronic @xcite and acoustic @xcite devices to the beneficial influence on mechanical properties ( e.g. , increased hardness ) and performance of protective hard coatings @xcite .",
    "it crystallises in the wurtzite structure ( b4 , space group @xmath6 ) . under non - equilibrium deposition parameters , its metastable zinc - blende variant ( b3 , space group @xmath7 )",
    "can be stabilised @xcite .",
    "finally , under pressures above @xmath8 @xcite it transforms to the rock - salt structure ( b1 , space group @xmath9 ) .",
    "the knowledge of surface energies and the corresponding trends is important in several areas . as discussed by gall _",
    "@xcite for the case of tin , surface energy is a decisive parameter for the thin film microstructure when grown under near - to - equilibrium conditions , i.e. when thermodynamics rather than kinetics control the texture formation .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the chemical vapour deposition of aln for optoelectronic applications . equally important",
    "is this quantity for the discussion of decomposition pathways of , e.g. , unstable ti@xmath10al@xmath11n @xcite .",
    "another emerging area of interest is the stabilisation of rock - salt aln using a multilayer architecture for ti@xmath10al@xmath11n / aln or cr@xmath10al@xmath11n / aln coatings @xcite , as it strengthens the material , and has the potential for stopping and/or deflecting cracks @xcite . due to the nanostructured character of these composites , surface energy represents a non - negligible contribution for the overall energetic balance @xcite .",
    "although there exist plenty of papers , both on calculations as well as on experimental results , a systematic study of the surface energies is missing . in this letter",
    "we use quantum mechanical calculations to obtain energies of several low - index clean surfaces ( i.e. , no surface reconstruction is considered here ) of the b1 , b3 , and b4 allotropes .",
    "since we cover several surface orientations as well as crystallographic structures , these results represent a coherent data set which can be directly used as is in above described applications .",
    "quantum mechanical calculations within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) were performed using the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite.the projector augmented wave method pseudopotentials used generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite as parametrised by perdew and wang @xcite . the first brillouin zone ( 1bz ) of the bulk material unit cells",
    "was meshed with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 @xmath15-points distributed according to the monkhorst - pack scheme for the b1 , b3 , and b4 allotrope , respectively .",
    "the sampling was adopted for the surface supercells ( see below ) , with only 1 @xmath15-point along the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the total energy was obtained by integration over the whole 1bz using the tetrahedron method .",
    "these parameters together with plane wave cut - off energy of @xmath16 ensure accuracy of the total energy of @xmath17 .    for each structure and each surface orientation , an @xmath18-atom primitive cell was constructed such that the particular facet was perpendicular to the @xmath19-axis .",
    "subsequently , @xmath20 primitive cells were stacked along the @xmath19-axis followed @xmath21 thick vacuum .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied on those slabs .",
    "if the surface area is @xmath22 and contains @xmath23 atoms , the surface energy is calculated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total energy of the slab while @xmath26 is the bulk total energy per atom of the respective structure .",
    "positions of all atoms were relaxed during calculations of @xmath25 .    finally , @xmath27 is converged simultaneously with respect to the number of primitive cells in the slab , @xmath20 , and the vacuum thickness , @xmath21 , in order to rule out undesired surface interactions either though the bulk material or though the separating vacuum .",
    "the calculated bulk lattice parameters ( see tab .  [ tab : alat ] ) agree well with both calculated and experimental values previously published .",
    "the lowest energy of formation is obtained for the wurztite b4 structure , closely followed by the zinc - blende b3 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the rock - salt structure b1 possesses highest energy of formation ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these values correspond well with data calculated by siegel _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    ".lattice constants , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , total energy , @xmath32 , and energy of formation , @xmath33 , of individual aln structures . calculated and experimental lattice parameters from the literature are given for comparison .
