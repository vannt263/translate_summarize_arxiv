    "it is generally recognized that all the microscopic phenomena that we observed can be described and explained by the principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "these principles have been extensively tested , and some of them are commonly used in several technological applications .",
    "other principles , like the ones related to the superposition principle and the measurement process , and which are in the realm of most of the paradoxes and strange phenomena related to quantum mechanics , have only recently become important in some applications . in particular",
    ", they form the basis of a new theory of information which may revolutionize the fields of communication and computation @xcite .",
    "the basic ideas behind quantum communication and computation are very simple @xcite .",
    "quantum communication deals with sending quantum states from one place to another one in such a way that they arrive intact .",
    "the most important application so far in this field is the one in which a sender ( traditionally called alice ) tries to convey a secret message to a receiver ( traditionally called bob ) .",
    "the message is encoded in the state @xmath0 of a quantum system . due to the fact that the quantum state of a system is distorted",
    "if somebody performs a measurement , bob will receive a wrong state if a third ( malevolent ) party ( eve ) tries to read the message .",
    "this way of secret communication is usually called quantum cryptography , and it is the only provably secure way in which two partners can share secret messages . in the context of quantum computation ,",
    "the existence of entangled states of several particles offers the possibility of performing certain computational tasks in times much shorter than the ones taken by common ( classical ) computers . by acting on a system entangled to other systems ,",
    "one modifies the state of the whole system at the same time , which leads to an important speed up in several computations . in particular , if one could build a quantum computer one would be able to decompose very large numbers ( of @xmath1 digits ) into prime factors in a time that scales polynomially with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 constants ) @xcite , in contrast to the exponential dependence of classical computers @xcite .",
    "a quantum computer would therefore allow to break all the classical cryptographic protocols which are based on the impossibility of factorizing large numbers in relatively short times .",
    "there are also other algorithms which make use of the superposition principle in quantum mechanics and they are more efficient that the classical counterparts .",
    "the experimental situation in quantum computing and quantum communication is very different .",
    "whereas in the second case it is already a mature field , close to reaching the commercial level , the first one is still in its infancy . for the moment , it is possible to construct very small prototypes of quantum computers which , of course , do not offer any advantage over nowadays classical computers .",
    "in fact , it seems almost impossible that a _ useful _",
    "quantum computer can be created in the next twenty or thirty years . nevertheless , pursuing research in this field does not have the only goal of being useful in the near future , but there are several other goals which can be attained in the way . in particular , creating a quantum computer means that we can manipulate the quantum state of an enormous system at will which apart from being capable of bringing some surprises to our present knowledge of quantum mechanics , paves the way for some other applications based on this theory which may be discovered in the future and do not require a large system .",
    "on the other side , the first experiments on quantum cryptography took place between location separated by few centimeters . at present , quantum cryptography over distances of",
    "the order of 50 km is possible .",
    "other experiments on quantum communication achieve basically the same distances .",
    "their extension to longer distances does not seem to be straightforward though , since the systems carrying the quantum states ( i.e. photons ) are eventually absorbed and therefore the quantum states are distorted before they arrive at their destination . a way to overcome",
    "this problem is to use quantum repeaters @xcite , in which small quantum computers amplify in a sense the quantum states so that they arrive safely to their destination .",
    "there are very few systems in which one can implement a small quantum computer .",
    "many of the ideas come from the field of quantum optics .",
    "the reason is the spectacular experimental development of this field during the last years , which has allowed , so to say , to dominate the quantum world . in particular ,",
    "the internal quantum levels of atoms and ions can be manipulated very efficiently using lasers .",
    "one can basically stop them ( i.e. cool them ) with laser cooling techniques .",
    "it is also possible to manipulate their quantum state of motion by pushing them with laser light .",
    "these methods , when combined appropriately , allow , at least in principle , to perform quantum computations and to build quantum repeaters . on the other hand ,",
    "very recently it has been recognized that these goals can also be achieved using atomic ensembles , instead of single atoms .",
    "the idea is to manipulate some collective degrees of freedoms of atomic ensembles using lasers , the main advantage being that the atoms do not need to be manipulated one by one , and they can be at room temperature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to review some of the quantum optical systems that have been proposed to perform quantum computations , both using single atoms and using atomic ensembles . in the next chapter",
    "we will give a brief introduction to some of the main topics in quantum information theory , with particular emphasis on the ones that are needed in the next chapters . in the third chapter",
    "we will show how to use single atoms ( ions ) and photons in order to perform several tasks related to quantum information processing , whereas in the fourth chapter we will introduce several methods to deal with atomic ensembles .",
    "most of the counter - intuitive predictions of quantum mechanics are related to the superposition principle .",
    "for example , according to quantum mechanics the properties of one object are generally not defined when we do not observe it .",
    "this principle , when applied to more than one system , may lead to very intriguing phenomena related to non - locality ( actions in some system may affect in a special way some other systems ) which have called the attention of philosophers and physicists since the advent of quantum mechanics .",
    "the basic ingredient of such phenomena is _ entanglement _ ,",
    "i.e. the possibility of having two or more systems in a state which displays ( quantum ) correlations",
    ". apart from its fundamental interest , entanglement plays an important role in most of the applications in the field of quantum information @xcite . in particular , entangled states are crucial for quantum communication and computation . in this section",
    "we will review the concept of entanglement , as well as some of the basic concepts in quantum communication and computation .",
    "the characterization of this intriguing property of quantum mechanics , entanglement , is one of the central theoretical issues in quantum information theory .",
    "in fact , there are still many open questions regarding the entanglement properties of two or more quantum systems .",
    "although for pure states of two systems , entanglement is well understood , for more systems we do not yet know how to quantify this property .",
    "the situation becomes much more complicated if the state of the system is mixed . in that case",
    ", we do not even know in general how to determine whether two systems are entangled or not .",
    "this problem has important consequences in current experiments in this field , since after preparing a quantum state of a system one would like to determine whether it is entangled or not ( as we will explain , if it is not entangled this would mean that we could have created the same state in a much cheaper and straightforward way ) . in the first section of this chapter we will review this property , entanglement , both for pure and mixed states and will give some of the known criteria to determine whether a mixed state is entangled or not .",
    "mixed entangled states are not directly useful for quantum information purposes .",
    "however , there exist some methods , known under the name purification protocols , that allow us to make those states useful",
    ". we will review some of the basic purification protocols in the second subsection .    quantum computation and communication are the most visible applications in the field of quantum information . in the last subsections of this section",
    "we will review these two topics paying special attention to the physical properties that a quantum system must possess in order to be useful for these applications .",
    "in particular , we will give a set of requirements to build a quantum computer which will serve us in the next chapters to show that several quantum optical systems serve for this purpose .",
    "we will also review one of the main tools in the field of quantum communication , teleportation , which combined with certain purification protocols allow to extend quantum communication over arbitrarily long distances .",
    "the superposition principle is one of the basic concepts in quantum mechanics : if a system can be in two different states ( associated to the vectors @xmath6 ) then it can also be in the state described by a linear superposition @xmath7 .",
    "this implies the existence of states in which properties are not well defined . the situation is even more intriguing when we have a composite system .",
    "for example , let us consider two subsystems a and b whose states are associated to the elements of two hilbert spaces , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we will assume that these systems are located at different places , although for most of our treatment this condition is not required .",
    "let us consider states of the whole system in which one subsystem is in certain state @xmath10 and the other in @xmath11 .",
    "one denotes those states as @xmath12 or simply @xmath13 . according to the superposition principle ,",
    "any superposition of these states must also be possible , i.e. the state represented by @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "states of this form are called entangled states and play a fundamental role in quantum information .",
    "note that their existence arises from the fact that the states of the whole system must be described as elements of a hilbert space themselves .",
    "one says that @xmath16 is the tensor product of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath17 . thus entangled states are a direct consequence of the tensor product structure of the hilbert space describing composite systems .    in the following",
    ", we will  denote by \\{@xmath18 an orthonormal basis in @xmath19 respectively .",
    "although the definitions and results apply for general dimensions , for most of the examples we will consider qubits , i.e. systems where @xmath20 . in that case",
    "we will take as a basis \\{@xmath21 .",
    "we will use the pauli operators @xmath22 for qubits , there are some entangled states which play a very important role in quantum information , the so - called bell states .",
    "they are @xmath23 and measure the observable @xmath24 in both systems we will obtain the opposite result .",
    "actually , if we measure any observable @xmath25 we will always obtain opposite results in a and b , the reason being that @xmath26 is invariant under global rotations ( i.e. @xmath27 for all unitary operators @xmath28 ) .",
    "note that for all entangled states there always exist some correlations . for product vectors , however , the outcomes in a are independent of the outcomes in b.",
    "this can be also viewed by noting that if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two observables , then @xmath31 for product vectors , but not ( in general ) for entangled states .",
    "the existence of correlations , by itself , is not a property of entangled states .",
    "for example , if somebody provides with two boxes a and b in which there are either two black or two white balls , when we open the box we will see correlations .",
    "however , the correlations carried by entangled states are , in some sense , different to those , since they occur for any pair of observables .",
    "in fact , classical correlations like the ones displayed by the balls in the boxes are restricted by bell s inequalities @xcite , whereas the ones corresponding to entangled states may violate them .",
    "this is why with the correlations contained in entangled states we can perform things that are not possible using classical correlations .    in order to create",
    "entangled states out of product states we need interactions .",
    "this can be easily understood as follows . if we do not have interactions , the hamiltonian describing the evolution of systems a and b will be written as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the identity operator . since @xmath34 and @xmath35 commute with each other , we have that the evolution operator can be always written as @xmath36 , and the product state @xmath37 will evolve into @xmath38 which is a product state .",
    "operators of the form @xmath39 are called local operators . similarly , we can not get entangled states by measuring observables in a and b , independently since the state after the measurement will be changed by local operators .",
    "one says that entanglement can not be created by local operations ( operations meaning any action on the systems ) .",
    "note , however , that product states can be obtained by local operations ( in particular , by measurements ) .",
    "let us show now how we can tell whether a state is entangled or not , and how much .",
    "we consider a state of the form @xmath40 all the information about the state is in the coefficients @xmath41 which form a @xmath42 matrix that we will call @xmath43 .",
    "note that we could have chosen another orthonormal bases in @xmath44 to express this state .",
    "in fact , there is a particular basis in which the matrix of the coefficients is diagonal and positive .",
    "if we choose such a basis to write the state , it will have the simple form @xmath45 where @xmath46min@xmath47 , and @xmath48with @xmath49 this form is called schmidt decomposition .",
    "its existence directly follows from the singular value decomposition of the matrix @xmath43 , i.e. , the existence of two unitaries @xmath50 and @xmath51 and a diagonal one @xmath52 whose diagonal elements are @xmath53 such that @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath53 are called schmidt coefficients and the bases @xmath55 and @xmath56 are called schmidt bases .",
    "once we have expressed the state in the schmidt decomposition , it is very simple to obtain some other information .",
    "for example , if we are interested in predicting expectation values or probabilities of outcomes if we only measure system a ( or b ) , all the information about them is in the reduced density operator @xmath57tr@xmath58(@xmath59 ( analogously for @xmath60 we obtain @xmath61 conversely , the schmidt coefficients and the corresponding bases can be easily found by simply diagonalizing both reduced density operators .    for a product state @xmath62 , the reduced density operators are rank one projectors , i.e. @xmath63 this means that there is only one schmidt coefficient which is different than zero .",
    "conversely , if we have a state with only one schmidt coefficient then it must be a product state .",
    "equivalently , @xmath0 is a product state if and only if the corresponding reduced density operators correspond to pure states .",
    "this means that if we have an entangled state , the corresponding reduced density operators must correspond to mixed states , or , equivalently , that there must be more than one nonzero schmidt coefficients .",
    "thus , we see that the entanglement of a state is directly related to the mixedness of the reduced density operators .",
    "this is intuitively clear since , as we mentioned above , entangled states give rise to correlations and if we only observe one of the systems we loose information about these correlations which results in the fact that we will effectively have a mixed state .",
    "this suggests that we can measure the degree of entanglement by the degree of mixedness of the reduced density operators .",
    "there are several measures of mixedness of density operators ; perhaps the most popular one is the von neumann entropy @xmath64tr@xmath65 for a pure state this entropy is zero , whereas for a maximally mixed state ( described by the identity operator , properly normalized ) it gives @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "the entropy is convex , i.e. for @xmath68,$ ] , @xmath69\\geq $ ] @xmath70 , which means that it always increases by mixing ( i.e. by loosing information ) .",
    "this motivates the following definition : given a state @xmath71 , we define the _ entropy of entanglement _ , @xmath72 as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator be96 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath73    the entropy of entanglement only depends on the schmidt coefficients , but not on the corresponding basis .",
    "this means that it is invariant under local unitary operations .",
    "that is , if @xmath74 , then @xmath75 . on the other hand",
    ", one can show that it can not increase in average by local operations @xcite .",
    "that is , if we perform ( independent ) measurements in a and b and obtain the state @xmath76 after the measurement with probability @xmath77 , we have that @xmath78 note , however , that the previous inequality does not imply that none of the @xmath79 can be larger than @xmath72 , or even the maximum allowed @xmath80 .",
    "states @xmath81 for which @xmath82 are called _ maximally entangled states _ in @xmath67 dimensions .",
    "let us now consider more systems @xmath83 .",
    "now , we can have entangled states and product states of the different systems @xcite .",
    "for example , we can have a state of the form @xmath84cannot be written as product states .",
    "it is clear that in a state like that , the parties @xmath85and @xmath86 are entangled with each other , but not to the rest ; similarly , the parties @xmath87and @xmath88 are entangled among them , and the party @xmath89 is completely disentangled .",
    "in general we can consider all possible partitions of those systems in which we group certain of them .",
    "for example , we can consider the partition @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "we can classify the entangled states according to the different partitions .",
    "that is , a state is entangled according to some partition if it can be written as a product state of the corresponding disjoint elements of the groups , but not within each of the groups . in order to determine the partition corresponding to a particular state we can calculate all possible reduced density operators and look whether they correspond to mixed states or not .",
    "the quantification of the multipartite entanglement is a more complicated question which can be illustrated by the following example .",
    "let us consider three parties and the states @xcite , @xmath92 those are entangled states according to the partition @xmath93 .",
    "however it is hard to say which one is more entangled .",
    "certainly , the first one possesses a sticking non - local behavior , in the sense that it can be used to prove bell s theorem without using inequalities @xcite .",
    "however , it is very weak in the sense that if one party does not participate in the measurement ( or is lost ) , then all the entanglement disappears .",
    "however , the second one retains some entanglement even if one particle is lost ( in fact it is the most robust against particle losses ) @xcite .",
    "the states that we have considered in the previous section are idealized . in reality",
    ", all systems interact with some sort of environment .",
    "thus , we should include the state of the environment in our description in order to be consistent .",
    "in fact , due to the interaction between system and environment they will become entangled even if initially they were in a product state : @xmath94 .",
    "since we are only interested in our system , all the information that we can acquire ( without performing measurements in the environment ) are contained in the reduced density operator @xmath95tr@xmath96 $ ] , which will correspond to a mixed state .",
    "actually , this process in which a pure state is converted into a mixed state via its interaction  with the environment is some times called decoherence .",
    "the term decoherence comes from a process which makes the coherence ( non - diagonal elements of the density operator in a given basis ) to vanish .",
    "however , since this definition depends on the basis some authors prefer to call decoherence any process which is not describable by a unitary operator , i.e. which comes from the interaction of the system with some other system .",
    "note that density operators can be always be written in the form @xmath97 where the @xmath77 are positive and add up to one .",
    "one particular decomposition of this form is the spectral decomposition , in which , additionally , the vectors @xmath98 form an orthonormal basis . in general , except for pure states ( rank one density operators ) there are infinitely many decompositions . note that a decomposition like ( [ decrho ] ) tells us one way of creating a state described by @xmath99 .",
    "we simply have to prepare the system in state @xmath98 with probability @xmath77 .",
    "the fact that there exist infinitely many decompositions of a state means that it can be prepared in infinitely many different forms .",
    "for example , the state @xmath100 of one qubit can be prepared by choosing randomly one among the states \\{@xmath21 or one among the states @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "it is also worth stressing that even though the systems are prepared in different forms , they are completely indistinguishable .",
    "the reason is that the probability of any outcome after a measurement is completely determined by the density operator , so that if two systems have the same density operator they can not be distinguished by performing any measurement ( and therefore by any means ) . density operators are linear and self - adjoint ( @xmath103 ) , have trace one ( tr(@xmath104 ) , and are positive ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we thus have to define entanglement for mixed states @xcite .",
    "following what happens with pure states , it makes sense to define entangled states as those that require interactions between the systems in order to be prepared , and non - entangled ( or separable ) as the ones that can be created without interactions .",
    "more specifically , in quantum information a state is called entangled if it can not be prepared by local operations ( and classical communication ) out of a product state .",
    "as we will see , this definition is equivalent to imposing that mixtures of product states are not entangled .",
    "let us give some examples with two qubits : the state described by @xmath106 is not entangled since it is already a product state .",
    "any density operator of the form @xmath107 is not entangled since the states @xmath108 can be prepared locally out of the state @xmath109 . to see his , if we write @xmath99 as in ( decrho ) we can simply transform the state @xmath109 into @xmath110 with probability @xmath77 .",
    "the state @xmath111 is not entangled since it can be locally prepared as follows .",
    "we choose randomly 0 or 1 .",
    "if we have 0 , we prepare both a and b in state @xmath109 and otherwise in @xmath112 .",
    "obviously , in this way we do not need any interaction between the systems .",
    "we just need classical communication between the location of a and b so that the corresponding preparers can agree on the state they prepare . with these examples",
    "we see that the definition of entanglement is equivalent to the following mathematical characterization : @xmath99 is separable if and only if there exist @xmath113 and @xmath114 and @xmath115 such that @xmath116 otherwise it is entangled .",
    "it turns out that it is very hard in practice to determine whether a given state is entangled or not .",
    "there exists , however , an important sufficient criterion that may be useful in some occasions .",
    "it states @xcite that if @xmath117 has a negative eigenvalue ( i.e. it is not positive ) then @xmath99 is entangled . here",
    "@xmath117 stands for the partial transpose of @xmath99 with respect to the first system in the basis @xmath118 i.e. @xmath119 in general , the converse of this criterion is not true @xcite .",
    "that is , there exist entangled states fulfilling @xmath120 however , in low dimensions ( if @xmath121 this criterion ( called peres - horodecki criterion @xcite ) gives a necessary and sufficient condition :  @xmath99 is separable if and only if @xmath120 for other separability criteria see @xcite .",
    "given some state , sometimes we would like to know how close it is to some pure state , like for example a bell  state . in order to measure this quantity",
    "we define the fidelity of @xmath99 with respect to some state @xmath122 as    @xmath123    a fidelity @xmath124 means that our state is very close to the desired one . note that a completely random state has a fidelity @xmath125where @xmath67 is the dimension of the total hilbert space .",
    "a particular useful family of mixed states are the so - called werner - like states .",
    "let us consider two systems a and b with corresponding hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath67 both .",
    "given a state @xmath99 we depolarize it locally by applying the same random unitary operator to system a and system b. one can show that the state after this process has the form @xmath126 where @xmath127and @xmath128 are the projector onto the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces ( @xmath129 is the permutation operator ) , and @xmath130 and @xmath131 the corresponding dimensions . here , @xmath132 tr@xmath133 .",
    "@xmath134 is called werner - like state , since werner @xcite was the first one who introduced them for the case of qubits .",
    "one can easily show that @xmath134 is entangled if and only if @xmath135is not positive .",
    "most of the applications in the field of quantum information are based on the use of superpositions of pure states .",
    "however , in practice , the state that one has at disposal are mixed .",
    "for example , if one would like to perform quantum cryptography over long distances using entangled photons , when they arrive at the final location their state will also be entangled to the environment and therefore mixed .",
    "the longer the distance the photons have to travel , the more mixed they will become .",
    "unfortunately , if they are significantly mixed , the security of the corresponding cryptographic protocol will no longer be ensured .",
    "this fact considerably limits the distances over which one can perform secure quantum cryptography .",
    "fortunately , there is a method that allows to make the states more pure , and even more entangled .",
    "the idea is to use several copies of a state which is not useful for the applications of quantum information , but that it is still entangled @xcite .",
    "using local operations and classical communication it is sometimes possible to obtain fewer copies of particles in a state which is closer to a maximally entangled states , for example the state @xmath136 . this process is called entanglement purification ( or distillation ) , and will be the subject of the present section .",
    "let us consider the two - qubit werner state , @xmath137 where all the vectors appearing here are bell states . in the present scenario , alice and",
    "bob share two pairs of qubits in that state .",
    "let us denote by @xmath85 and @xmath138 alice s particles and by @xmath139 and @xmath140 bob s , so that their state is @xmath141 .",
    "the distillation procedure presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is as follows .",
    "first , alice applies the unitary transformation @xmath142 to her two qubits .",
    "this transforms in each pair @xmath143 thus , the resulting state will have now the maximum contribution coming from @xmath144 then , both apply locally a controlled - not operation to their two particles , where @xmath85 and @xmath139 act like sources , and the other two ( @xmath138 and @xmath140 ) as targets .",
    "the control - not operation acts as follows : @xmath145 and similarly with @xmath30 .",
    "alice and bob then measure the state of their target particle in the basis @xmath146 ( i.e. , they measure @xmath147 and @xmath148 and broadcast their results . if the results are the same , they keep the source particles , and otherwise they discard them .",
    "one can easily see that this is equivalent to projecting the initial states onto the subspace in which either both the sources and the targets are @xmath149 states or both are @xmath150 states .",
    "the probability of having at the end of the process the state @xmath136 is @xmath151    for @xmath152 , we have that @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the fidelity after this operation increases .",
    "to finish the process , the output states should be left in a werner state , so that this process can be continued .",
    "alice applies the operation @xmath142 to his source particle , which transforms @xmath154 and then they depolarize . in summary , if the process is successful , alice and bob are left with a single pair in a werner state but with fidelity @xmath155 .",
    "then , they can take two successful pairs and repeat the same procedure to obtain a higher fidelity . by proceeding in this way",
    "they can reach a fidelity as close to one as they wish , but at the expenses of wasting many pairs . in fig .",
    "figupuri we have plotted @xmath155 as a function of @xmath156 and show how the fidelity increases as one repeats it with the successful pairs .",
    "[ figupuri ]        so far we have assumed that the operations that take place during the purification protocol ( controlled - not , measurements , etc . )",
    "are perfect . in reality",
    "there will be imperfections in all these operations .",
    "one can take them into account by using some explicit models @xcite or by studying the worst case scenario @xcite .",
    "the result is schematized in fig .",
    "[ figpuriimperf ] .",
    "now , there is a minimum value of the original fidelity of the state @xmath157 for which purification is possible .",
    "apart from that , there is a maximum achievable fidelity @xmath158due to the imperfections .",
    "[ figpuriimperf ]            a computation can be considered as a physical process that transforms an input into an output .",
    "a classical computation is that in which the physical process is based on classical laws ( without coherent quantum phenomena ) .",
    "a quantum computation is that based on quantum laws ( and in particular on the superposition principle ) . in quantum computation ,",
    "inputs and outputs are represented by states of the system .",
    "for example , enumerating the state of a given basis as \\{@xmath159 , the number @xmath160 would be represented by the @xmath160th state of this basis .",
    "a quantum computation consists of evolving the system with a designed hamiltonian interaction , such that the states are transformed as we want .",
    "note that the operation that transforms input into outputs has to be unitary .",
    "for example , the operation that gives @xmath33 if a number is odd and @xmath161 if it is even could not be implemented : @xmath162and @xmath163 ( where @xmath2 is an integer ) .",

    "the idea of the method for quantum error correction is based on designing the code words in such a way that every possible error ( in the first , second , or third qubit ) transforms the subspace of code words onto another subspace which is orthogonal to it , but without modifying its internal structure .",

    "the subspace of code words has to be such that all these subspaces are mutually orthogonal .",
    "this condition imposes a minimum bound ( the quantum hamming bound ) to the number of qubits needed , since all these orthogonal subspaces have to fit in @xmath16 .",
    "one can easily show that this bound implies that    @xmath233    for @xmath234 the minimum @xmath2 is @xmath235 .",
    "methods have been devised to construct codewords for each of these cases @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can take into account the errors that are produced while errors are being corrected , as well as the ones produced during operations .",

    "there are some ways of avoiding this . in the following",
    "we will describe a basic tool in quantum communication which allows to send one quantum state from one place to another provided one has a maximally entangled state shared between the two places , and is able to communicate classically without errors .      by teleportation",
    "we define to transfer an intact quantum state from one place to another , by a sender who knows neither the state to be teleported nor the location of the intended receiver @xcite .",
    "the term teleportation comes from science fiction meaning to make a person or object disappear while an exact replica appears somewhere else .",
    "the first teleportation experiments have recently taken place .",
    "consider two partners , alice and bob , located at different places .",
    "alice has a qubit in an unknown state @xmath245 , and she wants to teleport it to bob , whose location is not known . prior to the teleportation process , alice and bob share two qubits in a bell state @xmath246 .",
    "the idea is that alice performs a joint measurement of the two - level system to be teleported and her particle . due to the nonlocal correlations contained in the bell state",
    ", the effect of the measurement is that the unknown state appears instantaneously in bob s hands , except for a unitary operation which depends on the outcome of the measurement .",
    "if alice communicates to bob the result of her measurement , then bob can perform that operation and therefore recover the unknown state ( for experiments , see boumeester97,boschi98,furusawa98 ) .",
    "let us call particle 1 that which has the unknown state @xmath247 , particle 2 the member of the epr that alice possesses and particle 3 that of bob .",
    "we write the state of particle 1 as @xmath248 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are ( unknown ) complex coefficients .",

    "the possible outcomes are :    with probability @xmath252 , alice finds @xmath253 .",
    "the state of the third particle is automatically projected onto @xmath254 .",
    "thus , in this case bob does not have to perform any operation .    with probability @xmath252 , alice finds @xmath255 .",

    "the state of the third particle is automatically projected onto @xmath260 .",
    "teleportation occurs if bob applies @xmath24 to his particle .",
    "note that alice ends up with no information about her original state so that no violation of the no - cloning theorem occurs . in  this sense",
    ", the state of particle 1 has been transferred to particle 3 . on the other hand",
    ", there is no instantaneous propagation of information .",
    "bob has to wait until he receives the ( classical ) message from alice with her outcome .",
    "before he receives the message , his lack of knowledge prevents him from having the state .",
    "note that no measurement can tell him whether alice has performed her measurement or not .",
    "since teleportation is a linear operation applied to a state , it will also work for statistical mixtures , or in the case in which particle 1 is entangled with other particles .",
    "we have now all necessary tools available to introduce the concept of the quantum repeater .",
    "our goal is to create an epr pair of high fidelity between two distant locations . since nonlocal entanglement between distant particles",
    "can not be created using only local operations , this involves the usage of a quantum channel , which is noisy in general .",
    "the bottleneck for communication over large distances is the scaling of the error probability with the length of the channel . when using , for example , optical fibers and single photons as a quantum channel , both the absorption losses and the depolarization errors scale exponentially with the length of the channel .",
    "the state of the photon or the photon itself will therefore be destroyed with almost certainty if the channel is longer than a few half - lengths of the fiber .    to overcome this problem",
    ", one can use quantum repeaters .",
    "the idea of such a repeater is to divide a long quantum channel into shorter segments , which are purified separately , before they are connected .",
    "connecting two segments of a channel means here to build up quantum correlations across the compound channel from correlations that exist across the individual segments .",
    "this can be done by teleportation of entanglement .",
    "a quantum repeater must therefore combine the methods of entanglement purification and teleportation .",
    "although the combination of these methods should , in principle , allow to create entanglement over arbitrary distances , it is another question how much this  costs  in terms of resources needed for purification .",
    "resources means here the number of low fidelity entangled pairs that have to be provided for purification of each channel segment .",
    "this quantity is related to the number of particles that have to be manipulated locally ( at the connection points between the segments ) in a coherent fashion .",
    "if the resources grow too fast with the length of the channel , not much will be gained by the whole procedure .",
    "a further important quantity is the error tolerance for the local operations . in every real situation",
    ", the local operations applied to one or more particles will bear some imperfections .",
    "since such operations are the building blocks for any entanglement purification protocol , their imperfections will limit the maximum attainable fidelity for an epr pair and the efficiency of the protocol . in the context of the quantum repeater",
    ", a maximum fidelity @xmath261 corresponds to a residual amount of noise for each segment . when the segments are connected , this noise accumulates .    to overcome this limitation @xcite",
    ", we can divide the long channel into @xmath160 smaller segments and create less distant entangled pairs across each segment . the number of segments @xmath160 is thereby chosen in such a way that it is possible to create entangled pairs with sufficiently high initial fidelity @xmath262 over the distance of such a segment , such that they can be purified , according to our previous discussion . in a next step , we connect these `` elementary '' pairs by using teleportation .",
    "for example if we have an entangled purified pair between the nodes @xmath85and @xmath138 , and another one between @xmath138 and @xmath263we teleport the state of the first particle in @xmath138 to @xmath86 by using this second pair .",
    "the result of this teleportation will be that the nodes @xmath85and @xmath86 will now share an entangled state .",
    "of course , due to imperfections during the teleportation procedure , as well as the fact that the pairs used were not perfectly pure , the new entangled state will not be pure .",
    "but as long as its fidelity is larger than @xmath157 , it will be possible to purify it to a value close to @xmath264 thus , the crucial point is that , on the one hand , the operations that are performed can not be too noisy since otherwise they could decrease the fidelity below @xmath157 , which would make the process impossible ; on the other hand , the distance between nodes has to be such that purification be possible .",
    "this limits the number of pairs one can connect before purification becomes impossible .",
    "we therefore connect a smaller number @xmath265 of pairs so that the resulting fidelity @xmath266 stays above the threshold value for purification ( @xmath267 ) and purification is possible .    the general strategy will be to design an alternating sequence connection and ( re-)purification procedures in such a way that the number of resources needed remains as small as possible , and in particular does not grow exponentially with @xmath160 and thus with @xmath203 .",
    "this is possible , in principle , using a nested purification protocol @xcite .",
