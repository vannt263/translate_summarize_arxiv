    "searching the higgs boson , the last missing piece in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , is one of the essential goals of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the minimal higgs boson model is the simplest solution to electroweak symmetry breaking and also the most economic one to be consistent with existing precision measurements .",
    "however , theoretical considerations suggest that the minimal higgs boson model may not be complete . being a fundamental scalar ,",
    "higgs boson receives quantum corrections of quadratic divergence . to solve this ,",
    "there have been many theoretical proposals which predict various new physics at @xmath9(tev ) .",
    "direct evidences of new resonances at the lhc can determine what the new physics model is .",
    "however , if the higgs boson were the only particle at the lhc accessible range , we will have to rely on precision measurements .",
    "the precision measurement of higgs boson properties can play an important role to confirm electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite and test new physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , measurement on top quark yukawa coupling @xmath10 is crucial to probe the origin of fermion mass generation while @xmath11 production due to the top quark loop directly depends on the coupling @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution from new physics may also change the @xmath11 production rate significantly .",
    "one interesting scenario will be that at the lhc one does discover the conventional higgs search channels , confirm it is the higgs and measure its mass but the observed event number is much smaller than what we expect for the sm higgs of that mass .",
    "however , a new decay mode of higgs boson that can not be easily identified will lead to the same consequence when the new decay width is comparable with the conventional sm higgs width at the same mass @xcite .",
    "for instance , if higgs decay has an invisible mode , it is impossible to fully reconstruct such resonance and is very challenging to identify at the hadron colliders @xcite .    in this paper , we want to consider the invisible decay of higgs to a pair of hidden sector scalar ( @xmath2 ) particles in the minimal extension of the sm @xcite . as the scalar particle is a singlet of the sm interactions it can only directly couple to the higgs by the interaction lagrangian h^h s^2 h^h s^2 , where @xmath12 is a dimension one coupling constant and @xmath13 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs boson .",
    "it is a challenge to identify such invisible higgs at collider experiments and obtain any bound on invisible higgs .",
    "the only controlled experiments at this moment that can put constraints on such decay mode are through low energy processes such as rare @xmath0 or @xmath14 decays . in these processes",
    "the higgs is virtual , not interacting directly to @xmath0 or @xmath14 , but to top quark and @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the only difference is ckm factor , for @xmath14 it is about @xmath15 smaller than @xmath0 , so we would need more than @xmath16 @xmath14 s . therefore , we just focus on rare @xmath0 decays in this work .    in table",
    "[ table:1 ] , we show the theoretical estimates of branching ratios ( brs ) within the sm @xcite and their current experimental bounds at @xmath0 factories @xcite for the decays @xmath17",
    ". the errors of the sm estimates in table  [ table:1 ] are mainly due to the hadronic transition form factors and the ckm matrix elements , since those decay channels are among the cleanest sm processes due to only involving electroweak penguin diagrams @xcite , except for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "please note that by taking the ratios such as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , we can reduce considerably the uncertainties related to the hadronic form factors @xcite . for @xmath21 ,",
    "similarly one may consider the ratio @xmath22 where the uncertainties from the hadronic form factors are canceled to a large extent @xcite .",
    ".expected brs in the sm and experimental bounds ( 90% c.l . ) in units of @xmath23 .",
    "the sm values for @xmath24 include the long distance contributions through intermediate on - shell @xmath25 , which can be dominant for @xmath26 case @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table:1 ]    here we will focus on @xmath27 decay as its experimental upper bound is closest to the sm prediction as shown in table  [ table:1 ] . using the sm expectation value _ ( b^+ k^+",
    "| ) = 5.10.8 10 ^ -6 , and the current upper bound from belle @xcite on this final state as @xmath28 we can derive the corresponding constraint on higgs invisible decay width .",
    "to be kinematically allowed in @xmath4 , the singlet scalar can not be heavier than @xmath29 gev .",
    "therefore , the scalar can be easily thermalized through the higgs interactions in the early universe .",
    "we first discuss its cosmological bound in next section .",
    "the third section is the discussion on @xmath0 decay . after taking into all the constraints ,",
    "we discuss its implication in higgs in the section iv and finally the conclusion in section v.",
    "if we assume the renormalizability of the theory and allow the mass term quartic self - interaction term and the quartic interaction term with the higgs , the lagrangian of the scalar sector is written as @xmath30 the lagrangian respects the @xmath31 symmetry ( @xmath32 ) thus @xmath2 is a stable particle .",
    "indeed this scalar particle can be a good candidate of dark matter .",
    "the scalar particle could be in thermal equilibrium with the sm sector through interaction with higgs boson in early universe and finally its relic still may survive in the current universe in the form of dark matter @xcite . the relic density is determined by annihilation cross section of the scalar particle to the sm particles as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the annihilation cross section of @xmath2 to the standard model particles through @xmath35-channel higgs exchange diagrams and @xmath36 is relative velocity between annihilating @xmath2s .",
    "since we are mainly interested in gev scale particle , available channels are mainly to light leptons ( @xmath37 ) and quarks ( @xmath38 ) and the cross section is obtained as @xmath39 the precise value of @xmath40 where @xmath41 depends on the actual mass of scalar particle and the kinematically allowed channels .",
    "we found a stringent constraints on the annihilation cross section considering the wmap data @xmath42 @xcite as @xmath43 if @xmath44 gev and @xmath45 gev",
    "we get @xmath46 , respectively , which is within the strong coupling regime where the perturbative description of the model is not available .     from the relic abundance .",
    "allowed parameter space in @xmath47 plane with @xmath48 and @xmath49 gev , respectively .",
    ", width=377 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : relic ] , we presented the allowed parameter space in @xmath47 plane by the 5 year wmap data on cdm component with various values of higgs mass @xmath50 gev taking threshold effects into account .",
    "basically a gev scale mass range , only in which range @xmath4 is allowed , is not compatible with the cosmological observations .",
    "gev has been considered and the authors reached the same conclusion with ours : a large coupling constant is required in order to avoid overabundance .",
    "however , this large coupling constant is ruled out by the @xmath3 data , as we consider in sec .",
    "iii . ] on the other hand , if the scalar is heavier ( @xmath51 gev ) even though the scalar can not contribute to the @xmath0-decays but can be a successful dark matter candidate , if the @xmath12 coupling is properly chosen .",
    "however , we can easily avoid this cosmological constraint provided that the singlet actually decays into light particles since only ( absolutely ) stable particles can significantly contribute to the dark matter density of the current universe .",
    "as the longevity of the scalar particle is inherited by the @xmath31 symmetry , a mechanism of breaking @xmath31 symmetry leads to a natural way out .",
    "indeed there is a very promising source of the symmetry breaking .",
    "quantum gravity effect actually allows higher order operators and some of them might break global symmetries such as @xmath31 . for instance , the scalar particle may decay to a pair of photons or gluons through dimension five operators : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are ( unknown ) parameters .",
    "one should notice that both operators respect gauge symmetry but break @xmath31 symmetry .",
    "the life time of the scalar is suppressed by a large cutoff scale ( @xmath54 ) but certainly much shorter than the age of universe so that we can avoid the strong constraint from the relic density measurements .",
    "in this section we study the constraint on the interaction term between the higgs boson and the sm singlet from @xmath0 decays .",
    "specifically we will look at @xmath55 decay which currently has the most stringent experimental upper bound @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for this decay can be expressed as @xmath57 intuitively , @xmath58 decay can be divided into two processes : first b quark decays to s quark plus a off - shell higgs boson @xmath59 , and subsequently @xmath59 decays to two light singlets . from the interaction lagrangian term @xmath60 , with @xmath61 , it is easy to show that the higgs boson decay @xmath62 can proceed through a trilinear term @xmath63 .",
    "but as we will see later , another term @xmath64 is also crucial to guarantee the gauge independence of the decay amplitude .    to evaluate the decay amplitude , the wilson coefficient @xmath65 at scale @xmath66 should be known , which can be obtained by matching the full theory to the effective theory at scale around @xmath67 to obtain @xmath68 and then evolving down to @xmath69 .",
    "as the above operator does not mix with other effective operators , the qcd running effects can be obtained straightforwardly with the calculation of the anomalous dimension of @xmath70 @xcite : @xmath71 @xmath68 can be obtained by calculating the diagrams in fig .",
    "2 . notice that the higgs boson does not couple to @xmath35-quark by taking @xmath72 .    in fig .",
    "2 , the first eight diagrams represent exactly the intuitive picture that first @xmath73 , and then @xmath62 . since the later one is a trivial tree level process , one may first focus on the construction of an one - loop effective @xmath74 vertex @xmath75 with the coefficient in thooft - feynman gauge as @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 with the approximation @xmath79 .",
    "notice that this expression is gauge - dependent as the higgs boson is off - shell . although the calculation itself is straightforward , the issues about gauge dependence and renormalization scheme ambiguities are a bit subtle which were finally settle down by several groups a few years later @xcite .",
    "( 140,81 ) ( 0,0)-quark decays to @xmath35-quark plus two light singlets .",
    "the internal quark lines represent up , charm or top quarks , while the internal dashed lines denote higgs boson ( h ) or unphysical charged goldstone bosons ( @xmath80).,title=\"fig : \" ]    but for the decay amplitude @xmath81 to be gauge invariant , the last diagram in fig . 2 , _ i.e. _ fig .",
    "2(i ) , has to be included which ( surprisingly at first look ) does not contain virtual higgs boson exchange at all . actually fig .",
    "2(i ) arises from the interaction term @xmath64 .",
    "therefore strictly speaking , @xmath58 can not be factorized into @xmath82 and @xmath62 .    finally ,",
    "summing all the diagrams , we obtain into @xmath83 and @xmath62 .",
    "they then evaluate the @xmath74 vertex with the approximation of vanishing higgs boson mass .",
    "but even with these unrigorousness or approximations , they do obtain finally the correct expression which is due to the almost completely cancelation between fig .",
    "2(h ) and ( i ) up to @xmath84 .",
    "however , generally this kind of cancelation does not happen and the summation should be of order @xmath85 , as pointed out by botella and lim in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath86 the calculation details can be found in the appendix . here",
    "@xmath87 should be evaluated at the scale @xmath67 , but interestingly when combined with the qcd evolution effect of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcd running ] ) , one has @xmath88 please also note that in @xcite authors considered @xmath89 in an effective theory approach , however , with @xmath65 as model independent free parameters .    to get the decay amplitude ,",
    "the hadronic matrix element @xmath90 is needed as input , which can be related to the known form factors through equation of motion , @xmath91 with the light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) estimation @xcite @xmath92 as discussed in @xcite , the uncertainty of the @xmath93 dependence of the form factors have not been fully analyzed in lcsr but likely to be smaller than that at @xmath94 which is about @xmath95 .",
    "thus as an rough error estimation we assign a universal @xmath95 uncertainty to the above form factors .    then , the branching ratio can then be obtained @xmath96 taking as illustration @xmath97 and with the values @xcite @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we can obtain the branching ratio @xmath100 where only the form factor uncertainty has been included in the error estimation .",

    "<S> if the higgs boson were the only particle within the lhc accessible range , precision measurement of the higgs s properties would play a unique role in studying electroweak symmetry breaking as well as possible new physics . </S>",
    "<S> we try to use low energy experiments such as rare @xmath0 decay to constrain a challenging decay mode of higgs , in which a higgs decays to a pair of light ( @xmath1 gev ) sm singlet @xmath2 and becomes invisible . by using the current experimental bound of rare decay @xmath3 and computing the contribution of @xmath4 to ( the ) @xmath5 , we obtain an upper bound on the higgs coupling to such light singlet . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that the partial width of the invisible decay mode @xmath6 by taking the upper bound value of coupling is at a comparable level with @xmath7 or @xmath8 decay modes , making the higgs identifiable but with a different predicted decay br from [ the ] standard model higgs decay . </S>",
    "<S> it will then have an impact on precision measurement of the higgs s properties . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the implication for cosmology from such a light singlet and propose a solution to the potential problem . </S>"
