    "it is generally expected that the geometry of compact sources should resemble flat spacetime at large enough distances .",
    "this is true not only qualitatively , but through very precise falloff conditions that are built into the formal definition of asymptotic flatness .",
    "within this definition , the deviations from flat spacetime are well described ( in the sense of the leading order behaviour of an expansion in powers of `` @xmath4 '' ) by perturbations of the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "such perturbations can in turn be studied through the gauge invariant regge - wheeler and zerilli ( rwz ) formalisms @xcite .",
    "these allow one to derive , after a spherical harmonic decomposition ( that is , for each `` @xmath5 '' ) , two master evolution equations for the truly gauge invariant , linearized physical degrees of freedom .",
    "due to the multipole decomposition , these equations involve only one spatial coordinate ( the radial one ) . the fact that they are one - dimensional implies that these master equations can be solved for very large computational domains with very modest computational resources .",
    "on the other hand , three - dimensional cauchy codes are very demanding on their resource requirements . even though mesh refinement can help in this respect",
    ", there is a limit to how much one can coarsen the grid in the asymptotic region ; this limit is set by the resolution required to reasonably represent wave propagation in the radiative zone .",
    "the use of a grid structure adapted to the physical geometry ( possibly through multiple patches ) can also help @xcite , but one still ends up imposing artificial ( even if constraint - preserving ) boundary conditions at the outer boundary .",
    "for example , one in general misses information about the geometry outside the domain @xcite .",
    "two approaches that at the same time provide wave extraction , physically motivated boundary conditions , and extend the computational domain to the radiative regime are cauchy ",
    "characteristic @xcite and cauchy  perturbative matching ( cpm ) @xcite ; this paper is concerned with the latter .",
    "the idea is to match at each timestep a fully non - linear cauchy code to an outer one solving , say , the rwz equations , one might , in principle , try to solve for perturbations of kerr spacetime ( as opposed to schwarzschild ) . ] .",
    "this paper is the first one in a series where we plan to revisit cpm in the light of some recent technical developments which we describe below that should help in its implementation . before discussing these developments , we point out and summarize some features present in the original implementation of cpm which we hope to improve on :    1 .",
    "the non - linear cauchy equations were solved on a cartesian , cubic grid . on the other hand ,",
    "the rwz equations use a radial coordinate for the spatial dimension .",
    "mixing cartesian coordinates with spherical ones leads to the need for interpolation back and forth between both grids .",
    "especially when using high order methods , this type of interpolation might not only be complicated but also subtle : depending on how it is done it might introduce noise and sometimes it might even be a source of numerical instabilities .",
    "when injecting data from the perturbative module to the cauchy code and vice versa boundary conditions were given to all modes , irrespectively of their propagation speed and without taking into account the existence of constraint violating boundary modes .",
    "one would intuitively expect a cleaner matching if boundary conditions are given according to the characteristic ( propagation ) speeds of the different modes , and even cleaner if constraint - preservation is automatically built in during the matching .",
    "low order numerical schemes , which result in slow convergence , were used .    in recent years",
    "there has been progress on several related fronts that should in principle help in the implementation of cpm .",
    "we describe these new results next :    1 .",
    "the first improvement is the ability to implement smooth ( in particular , spherical ) boundaries in 3d cauchy evolutions @xcite",
    ". one important advantage of this is the fact that the matching can be performed to either a perturbative or a characteristic outer module without the need for interpolation between spherical and cartesian grids . in that way",
    "a possible source of noise can be eliminated .",
    "it is now understood how to match different domains using schemes of arbitrary high order while at the same time ensuring numerical stability .",
    "one way of doing so is through the use of multiple patches ( much in the same way multiple charts are used in differential geometry ) , penalty terms and difference operators satisfying summation by parts  @xcite ( more about this below ) .",
    "this is the approach we shall explore here in the context of cpm .",
    "the second improvement is the construction of constraint - preserving boundary conditions ( cpbc ) .",
    "several efforts have by now reported numerically stable ( in the sense of convergent ) implementations of such boundary conditions for the fully three - dimensional non - linear einstein s equations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there have been reports in the context of cauchy  characteristic matching that significant improvements are obtained when this type of boundary conditions are used in the matching  @xcite . with this in mind , we will test their use in cpm .",
    "lastly , new , accurate and efficient high order difference operators satisfying sbp and associated dissipative operators have been constructed recently @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , in conjunction with certain penalty interface treatment such operators guarantee numerical stability when `` glueing '' together different computational grids .",
    "we will test these operators in the context of cpm .",
    "we have incorporated these techniques , i.e. , high - order summation - by - parts finite differencing and dissipation operators , multiple coordinate patches with penalty inter - patch constraint - preserving boundary conditions and cauchy  perturbative matching , into a spherically symmetric numerical code evolving the einstein ",
    "christoffel form of the field equations @xcite , minimally coupled to a klein - gordon field . using this tool , we can test the performance of the numerical methods in a non - trivial , but easily reproducible and computationally inexpensive setting , and gain experience for three - dimensional applications .",
    "the evolutions presented here model black holes with excision in isolation , under dynamical slicings , and black holes accreting scalar field pulses , which are used as a scalar analogue of gravitational radiation .    the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : equations ] we introduce the continuum system and the numerical techniques we have used .",
    "results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , where a black hole is evolved successively from simple settings , i.e. , single - patch , isolated , killing - field adapted gauges , to more involved ones including cauchy  perturbative matching and scalar pulse accretion .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we draw conclusions and give an outlook to future work .",
    "in this paper we use the einstein ",
    "christoffel ( ec ) system @xcite in spherical symmetry .",
    "we follow the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ; in particular , the densitized lapse is denoted by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is introduced for convenience . here , @xmath8 is the determinant of the 3-metric and @xmath9 the lapse function , while the 4-metric is written as @xmath10    the vacuum part of the evolution equations in spherical symmetry for this formulation constitute a symmetric hyperbolic system of six first order differential equations .",
    "the vacuum variables are the two metric and extrinsic curvature components @xmath11 where the extrinsic curvature is written as @xmath12 plus two auxiliary variables needed to make einstein s equations a first order system .",
    "these extra variables are defined as @xmath13    in addition , a massless klein - gordon field is minimally coupled to the geometry @xcite .",
    "the scalar field equation @xmath14 is converted into a first order system by introduction of the variables @xmath15 throughout this paper the prime and dot represent partial derivatives with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "constraint preserving boundary conditions are imposed by analyzing the characteristic modes of the main and constraint evolution systems , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "these modes and their associated characteristic speeds are summarized in table  [ ta : modes ] . for illustration purposes",
    ", we also show the direction of propagation of each mode in the schwarzschild spacetime in painlev - gullstrand coordinates @xcite .",
    ".characteristic modes for einstein - christoffel system in spherical symmetry , and their direction of propagation for a schwarzschild spacetime in painlev - gullstrand coordinates with respect to the vector field @xmath18 . in this gauge ,",
    "all modes are outflow at the inner boundary , if it is located at @xmath19 , while boundary conditions have to be applied to the incoming modes @xmath20 and @xmath21 at the outer boundary , assuming is is located at @xmath22 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table  [ ta : modes ] we notice that for the schwarzschild spacetime there are four ingoing and two outgoing gravitational modes at the outer boundary , and therefore expect the same count to hold for perturbations thereof .",
    "boundary conditions for the incoming modes @xmath23 and @xmath24 are fixed by the cpbc procedure .",
    "thus , the only free incoming modes are @xmath25 , which represents a gauge mode and @xmath21 , which represents a physical one ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "boundary conditions do not need to be specified at the inner boundary if it is located inside the event horizon , because all modes are outflow then .      since there is no radiative degree of freedom in spherically symmetric spacetimes , we use the massless klein - gordon field as a scalar analogue of gravitational waves . to emulate the setup of three - dimensional cauchy  perturbative matching as closely as possible ,",
    "the scalar wave is evolved on a fixed schwarzschild background in a `` perturbative '' patch defined for @xmath26 , while the fully non - linear einstein s equations are evolved in the `` cauchy '' patch , defined for @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the excision radius and the matching radius , respectively .",
    "the fact that we are using cpbc allows us to perform a clean matching . from the analytical point of view",
    "our matching works in the following way : as mentioned above , after the cpbc procedure , only two free characteristic modes are entering the cauchy computational domain ( at @xmath30 ) , denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath21 . since in a very precise sense @xmath25",
    "is a gauge mode , we are free to give boundary conditions to it in a very simple way : we just set it to its initial value .",
    "regarding @xmath21 , we use the \" perturbative  value of the same quantity coming from the perturtative domain as counterpart , and communicate these two modes ( how this is done at the numerical level is explained below ) . similarly , there is only one characteristic mode entering the perturbative domain , which is the linearized version of @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore communicate the non - linear and linear versions of that mode as well .",
    "given a well - posed initial - boundary value problem for einstein s field equations , we construct a stable and accurate discrete system by using operators satisfying the sbp property . in short , a finite difference operator , @xmath32 , satisfies sbp on a computational domain @xmath33 $ ] discretized using grid points @xmath34 and a grid spacing @xmath35 if @xmath36 holds for all grid functions @xmath37 . here the scalar product , @xmath38 is defined in terms of its coefficients @xmath39 by @xmath40    in this paper we use the new , efficient , and accurate high order sbp difference operators and associated dissipation operators constructed in ref .",
    "thus , as mentioned , this paper also serves as an extra test of those new operators .",
    "sbp operators are standard centered finite difference operators in the interior of the domain , but the stencils are modified to yield lower order operators in a region close to the boundaries ( at the boundary itself the stencil is completely one sided ) .",
    "there are several types of sbp operators depending on the properties of the norm .",
    "the simplest are the diagonal norm operators .",
    "they have the advantage that sbp is guaranteed to hold in several dimensions by simply applying the 1d operator along each direction and that numerical stability can be guaranteed by discrete energy estimates in a wide range of cases .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the order of the operator at and close to the boundary is only half the interior order .",
    "we denote the sbp operators by the interior and boundary order and consider here the diagonal operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the second type is the restricted full norm operators , where the norm is diagonal at the boundary but has a non - diagonal block in the interior .",
    "the advantage of these operators is that the order at and close to the boundary is only one order lower than in the interior , while the disadvantage is that schemes based on these operators may be unstable without the use of dissipation .",
    "the restricted full operators we use here are @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if the computational domain is split into several sub - domains ( `` patches '' ) , the discrete representation requires a stable technique to communicate the solution at inter - patch boundaries .",
    "we make use of a penalty method @xcite , which adds a damping term to the right hand side of the evolution equation at the boundary point in a way which retains linear stability .",
    "the method has a free parameter , called @xmath47 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which determines how much the difference between characteristic fields on either side of the inter - patch boundary is penalized .",
    "different values of @xmath47 result in different amount of energy dissipation at the inter - patch boundary and can in principle be chosen so that no energy is dissipated ( this is marginally stable ) .",
    "usually the value of @xmath47 is chosen such that some dissipation of energy occurs . with constant values of @xmath47",
    "the amount of dissipation decreases with resolution .      for the purposes of this paper , a one - dimensional code which supports constraint - preserving boundaries , multiple grid patches , and the use of the",
    "aforementioned high order sbp derivative and dissipation operators has been developed .",
    "in addition , the code is able to reproduce the ( single grid and without cpm matching ) second - order methods of ref .",
    "@xcite for comparison .",
    "we use the methods of lines , and the time integration is performed by a 4th order runge - kutta method .",
    "the grid patches that we consider here are not intersecting , but touching .",
    "this implies , that each grid function is double valued at the patch interface coordinate since the sbp derivative operators are one sided at the boundaries . to ensure consistency without compromising ( linear ) stability , we make use of a penalty method as described above .",
    "constraint - preserving boundary conditions require the calculation of derivatives of certain grid functions at the outer boundary , which we also obtain by using the sbp derivative operators .    in a black hole",
    "setting , the computational domain next to the excision boundary tends to quickly amplify high frequency noise , which can not be represented accurately on the discrete grid .",
    "this is especially true for high order accurate derivative operators .",
    "thus , high order simulations of black holes need a certain amount of numerical dissipation to be stable .",
    "this dissipation is here provided by the sbp dissipation operators constructed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the free parameters of these operators , namely the coefficient of the dissipation and the extent of the transition region ( for non - diagonal operators ) , are found by numerical experiment .",
    "the numerical experiments presented in this section are set up to systematically test the performance of the new techniques in several situations of increasing difficulty .",
    "we start with a series of tests evolving a schwarzschild black hole in painlev - gullstrand coordinates with either a single patch or two patches matched via the penalty method , and compare the performance of all sbp operators with the second order finite - differencing method presented in @xcite .",
    "next , to test more dynamical situations , a gauge or scalar field signal is injected in a constraint - preserving manner through the outer boundary and accreted onto the black hole . a robust stability test",
    "is then performed with noise on the incoming gauge mode @xmath25 , and , with cauchy  perturbative matching , on the scalar field mode @xmath21 .",
    "finally , a series of high - precision tests involving all techniques are presented , in which a black hole accretes a scalar field injected through the outer boundary of the perturbative patch .",
    "these simulations also include a test of the long - term stability and accuracy after accretion and ring - down .      in our first series of tests ,",
    "a schwarzschild black hole is evolved with high - order accurate sbp operators , constraint - preserving boundary conditions and excision .",
    "perturbative matching is not used in these tests . to fix the coordinate system ,",
    "we make use of the horizon - penetrating painlev - gullstrand coordinates @xcite , and we fix the coordinate functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the previous section to their exact values .    for all tests ,",
    "the inner boundary is located well inside the event horizon ( more precisely , it is located at @xmath50 ) , which implies that all modes are outflow .",
    "therefore , no boundary conditions may be applied at the excision boundary .",
    "the exact boundary location is not crucial as long as it is inside the apparent horizon , but this choice facilitates comparison with @xcite .",
    "also , in dynamical situations the apparent horizon location may move significantly on the coordinate grid , and to ensure outflow conditions at the inner boundary some penetration into the black hole is of advantage . to match the setup of @xcite",
    ", we set the outer boundary to @xmath51 . to ensure well - posedness of the continuum problem ,",
    "boundary conditions should be applied to the incoming modes @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath25 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 .",
    "however , three of these modes , namely @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath24 , can be fixed by the use of constraint - preserving boundary conditions , as discussed in section [ sec : equations ] , which leaves the freely specifyable gauge mode @xmath25 and the scalar field mode @xmath21 . since in these initial tests",
    "we are only interested in obtaining a stationary black hole solution , the initial scalar field is set to zero , and the ( scalar field ) characteristic mode @xmath21 is penalized to zero as well .",

    "@xcite , namely second order spatial derivatives with fourth order kreiss - oliger dissipation ( which is set to zero near the boundaries ) and a third order extrapolation at the boundaries , with the sbp derivative and dissipation operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath45 , @xmath43 , @xmath46 and @xmath44 .",
    "the figure shows the evolution of the @xmath61 norm of the misner - sharp mass error over an evolution time of @xmath62 . in all cases displayed",
    "there is a linear growth in the error after some time .",
    "this is an artefact of the discrete representation of the constraint - preserving boundary conditions .",
    "we have also performed tests with maximally dissipative boundary conditions : these yield a discrete equilibrium after some time , and thus allow for evolutions of unlimited time . however , since these boundary conditions are not correct for most systems of practical interest , we only make use of this result to point out the source of the linear growth of errors observed , which converges away with increasing resolution .",
    "as soon as the error gets close to @xmath63 , the code encounters an instability , which , in this case , is associated with a migration of the excision boundary outside of the black hole , and consequently ill - posedness of the continuum problem .",
    "while this migration could be theoretically avoided by choosing horizon - fixing dynamical coordinate conditions , a solution with this magnitude of error is , in any case , not of practical use .    in the present numerical code ,",
    "the sbp operators are also used as one - sided derivatives for determining the constraint - preserving boundary conditions , which suggests that the operator @xmath41 , which is only first order at the boundaries , will yield less accurate outer boundary conditions than the third order method in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : bh_pg ] clearly demonstrates this fact",
    ". however , the operators @xmath43 , @xmath46 and @xmath44 are significantly more accurate than the results presented in ref.@xcite , and already so at the coarsest resolution .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath64 the sbp operator @xmath46 induces a solution error of less than @xmath65 ( that is , _ four orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding errors when using the second order method of @xcite with the same resolution _ ) within @xmath66 , which appears sufficiently accurate for many practical purposes .    .",
    "the axes show the quantities described in figure  [ fig : bh_pg ] .",
    "it is clear that even with low resolutions of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the operators @xmath46 and @xmath44 are able to evolve the black hole in a stable manner for a significant time . ]",
    "the long - term evolution of a schwarzschild black hole with the operators @xmath46 and @xmath44 is displayed in figure  [ fig : bh_pg_100000 ] .",
    "the linear growth of errors dominates the solution at late times , but since this error significantly decreases with resolution , long evolution times can be obtained even for moderate radial grid spacings .",
    "this is naturally an interesting feature for simulations with three - dimensional spatial grids , where computational resources are still a viable concern .      as dicussed in the introduction",
    ", the use of multiple coordinate patches has advantages when modelling black holes . to implement a stable interface boundary condition ,",

    "it is apparent that strong random noise induces a stronger growth in the solution error .",
    "however , this growth is still linear . as in all black hole evolutions in section ( [ sec : bh_pg ] ) , the system encounters a numerical instability as the solution error approaches @xmath63 , but this is not a consequence of the random noise , but of the inner boundary becoming partially inflow due to a coordinate motion of the apparent horizon .",
    "also , with increasing resolution , the growth rate of the error does not increase , as shown in figure  [ fig : robust_stability_u3_resolutions ] .",
    "we conclude that this high - order evolution system is discretely stable against strong random perturbations .",
    "we now test the stability of the system with cauchy  perturbative matching against random perturbations in the scalar field . to this end",
    ", the computational domain is again subdivided as in section ( [ sec : robust_stability_u3 ] ) , but the right patch evolves the scalar field on a fixed painlev - gullstrand background as explained in the introduction .",
    "the interpatch boundary is thus matching the cauchy patch to a perturbative one , and we test the stability of the system against random perturbations by imposing random noise on the incoming scalar field mode on the outer boundary of the perturbative patch .     as described in the introduction .",

    "since the mass error is not available for a system accreting a scalar field , the @xmath61 norm of the hamiltonian constraint is used again in figure  [ fig : robust_stability_u8_amplitudes ] .",
    "no exponential growth can be observed in the hamiltonian constraint violation .",
    "the same is true when increasing the resolutions , as in figure  [ fig : robust_stability_u8_resolutions ] , which also deserves some additional comments : the robust stability test does not lead to a converging sequence of solutions if the random noise amplitude is not diminished with resolution .",
    "however , the purpose of these tests is to excite any unstable high freqcency modes present in the numerical system .",
    "the absence of any mode growing with increasing resolution shows that the system with a cauchy  perturbative matching interface is stable even against strong random noise injected into the system .",
    "this is a promising result for any effort to do three - dimensional matching between cauchy modules and perturbative ones using multiple patches and high - order summation - by - parts operators .      finally ,",
    "using the massless klein - gordon field as a scalar analogue of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry , we model the accretion of a gravitational wave packet across a cauchy  perturbative matching boundary .",

    "to obtain long - term evolutions of compact astrophysical systems in three spatial dimensions , advanced numerical techniques are preferable in that they may improve stability and accuracy of the associated discrete model system . while high accuracy enables efficient use of the available computational resources , well - posedness of the continuum model and numerical stability are requirements which can not be met by increasing computational power .",

    "only recently the consideration of the well - posedness of the differential system and the application of theorems on discrete stability of the numerical system have provided hints as how to address the outstanding issues . in this paper , we have applied all these techniques to a model system : a spherically symmetric black hole coupled to a massless klein - gordon field .",
    "we find that the use of a first - order hyperbolic formulation of einstein s field equations , combined with high - order derivative and dissipation operators with the summation - by - parts property , penalized inter - patch boundary conditions and constraint - preserving outer boundary conditions leads to a stable and accurate discrete model .",
    "specifically , isolated schwarzschild black holes in coordinates adapted to the killing fields , and in coordinates on which a gauge wave is imposed , and schwarzschild black holes accreting scalar wave pulses were taken as typical model systems involving excision .",
    "the results show that the introduction of several coordinate patches and of a cauchy  perturbative matching interface does not introduce significant artefacts or instabilities .",
    "rather , the high - order methods allow the accurate long - term evolution of accreting black holes with excision and cauchy  perturbative matching in reasonable resolutions . as an example",

    "most system of interest in general relativistic astrophysics will necessarily require the use of three - dimensional codes .",
    "results from a one - dimensional study are useful in that they ( i ) allow to gain experience in a clean but non - trivial physical system , ( ii ) can be easily reproduced without the need to implement three - dimensional codes with multiple coordinate patches and ( iii ) allow to isolate sources of difficulty in the three - dimensional setting more easily . with the promising results from this study",

    "<S> one of the new developments is an understanding of how to impose constraint - preserving boundary conditions ( cpbc ) ; though most of the related research has been driven by outer boundaries , one can use them for matching interface boundaries as well . </S>",
    "<S> another front is related to numerically stable evolutions using multiple patches , which in the context of cpm allows the matching to be performed on a spherical surface , thus avoiding interpolations between cartesian and spherical grids . </S>",
    "<S> one way of achieving stability for such schemes of arbitrary high order is through the use of penalty techniques and discrete derivatives satisfying summation by parts ( sbp ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , new , very efficient and high order accurate derivatives satisfying sbp and associated dissipation operators have been constructed .    here </S>",
    "<S> we start by testing all these techniques applied to cpm in a setting that is simple enough to study all the ingredients in great detail : einstein s equations in spherical symmetry , describing a black hole coupled to a massless scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that with the techniques described above , the errors introduced by cauchy  perturbative matching are very small , and that very long term and accurate cpm evolutions can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> our tests include the accretion and ring - down phase of a schwarzschild black hole with cpm , where we find that the discrete evolution introduces , with a low spatial resolution of @xmath0 , an error of @xmath1 after an evolution time of @xmath2 . for a black hole of solar mass </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to approximately @xmath3 , and is therefore at the lower end of timescales discussed e.g. in the collapsar model of gamma - ray burst engines . </S>"
