    "in a key work , muller and roy used the crystal chemistry method of cation - anion coordination to categorize many of the compounds found experimentally in the major ternary structural families @xmath2@xmath7@xmath3@xmath8@xmath9 , @xmath0@xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 , and @xmath10@xmath1 known at the time of its publication in 1974.@xcite in their analysis of @xmath10@xmath1 compounds , they constructed structure field maps for those compounds with anions @xmath8 = o , f , and cl .",
    "these maps plot structure as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ionic radii and often lead to regions on the diagrams where only certain phases have been realized experimentally . from these maps , the structures for other @xmath2 and @xmath3 pairs can be predicted .",
    "absent from their analysis is any structure field map of @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds . indeed , very few of the compounds listed in their @xmath10@xmath1 section have @xmath8 = s , and , for those that do , some of these have phases that were reported as not known with certainty ( @xmath11 @xmath12 the compounds cazrs@xmath1 and srzrs@xmath1 synthesized by clearfield@xcite ) .",
    "since muller and roy s work , the number of synthesized @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds has increased substantially ; these show a distribution of structural motifs that is in stark contrast to their @xmath0o@xmath1 analogs .",
    "most @xmath0o@xmath1 compounds show networks of corner - sharing @xmath3o@xmath6 octahedra and are commonly called perovskites .",
    "several form in the ilmenite phase , in which layers of edge - connected @xmath2o@xmath13 octahedra are connected by faces and corners to layers of edge - connected @xmath3o@xmath13 octahedra .",
    "as well several other @xmath0o@xmath1 do not have any corner- , edge- , or face- sharing designation , but are instead distinguished by @xmath3o@xmath14 @xmath3 = b , c , n , s , cl , br , and i anionic complexes .",
    "pyroxenes are also a less common , but still noteworthy , subclass of @xmath0o@xmath1 types , in which @xmath3o@xmath15 tetrahedra are corner - connected . only a couple of @xmath0o@xmath1 have been found in phases with solely face - sharing or edge - sharing @xmath3o@xmath6 octahedral motifs .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds are observed with networks of either solely corner- , edge- , or face - sharing @xmath3s@xmath13 octahedral motifs .",
    "for example , bazrs@xmath1 and cazrs@xmath1 form as corner - sharing perovskites ; pbzrs@xmath1 and tltas@xmath1 form the edge - sharing nh@xmath9cdcl@xmath1 phase ; and batis@xmath1 , bavs@xmath1 , and banbs@xmath1 form face - sharing structures .",
    "further , they are not known to form pyroxenes and there are only two instances listed in fiz karlsruhe icsd database in which @xmath0s@xmath14 have anionic complexes with the @xmath3 mentioned above in @xmath0o@xmath14 : rbbs@xmath14 and tlbs@xmath14.@xcite they do not form the layered ilmenite phase either , but there are near stoichiometric compositions of @xmath0s@xmath1 ( denoted as misfit sulfides ) with sheets of edge - sharing @xmath3s@xmath6 octahedra sandwiching incommensurate rock salt - like @xmath2s layers .",
    "two examples of misfit layered compounds are ( sns)@xmath16tis@xmath7 and ( pbs)@xmath17tis@xmath7 .",
    "unlike their @xmath0o@xmath1 analogs , @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds are not neatly classified by the goldschmidt tolerance factor,@xcite",
    "@xmath18    where the various @xmath19 represent the ionic radii of the constituent species .",
    "a @xmath20 = 1 indicates ideal packing in the cubic perovskite structure . as shown by woodward for @xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "the corner - sharing perovskite phase is stable for 0.95 < @xmath20 < 1.05 , with most octahedral tilts being observed for @xmath20 < 1 , and most untilted structures being realized for @xmath20 > 1.@xcite coupled corner- and face - sharing phases ( _ e .",
    "srmno@xmath1 and baruo@xmath1 ) begin to form when @xmath20 > 1.04 , and completely face - sharing phases with no corner - sharing character form when @xmath20 > 1.10 ( @xmath11 @xmath12 bamno@xmath1 ) .",
    "the solely edge - sharing phase is rare in @xmath0o@xmath1 according to goodenough , and he lists just a single case in his extensive review of @xmath0o@xmath1 compounds : rbnbo@xmath1 with @xmath20 = 1.085.@xcite the ilmenites form with @xmath20 < @xmath21 0.8 . except for one or two cases , the pyroxenes and those @xmath0o@xmath14 compounds with @xmath3o@xmath14 anionic complexes form with @xmath20 greater than those of the corner - sharing perovskites .",
    "furthermore , except for a few compounds with @xmath3 = s or cl , those compounds with anionic complexes having @xmath3 = b , c , n , s , or cl , have @xmath20 factors strictly greater than those of solely face - sharing structures .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath0s@xmath1 , just for the compounds listed above , overlapping ranges are obtained : 0.88 < @xmath20 < 0.95 for corner - sharing structures , 0.92 < @xmath20 < 1.01 for edge - sharing structures , and 0.98 <",
    "@xmath20 < 1.03 for face - sharing structures . in the early 1980s , pettifor developed structure field maps in a different way from muller and roy .",
    "instead of using the ionic radii for the abscissa and the ordinate , he defined a chemical scale based on the results of phase groupings of 574 binary compounds.@xcite the elements , from hydrogen through the actinides , were scaled in such a manner that the resulting list also mirrored , to a large extent , an ordering of the elements by electronegativity.@xcite in 1988 , he applied his mapping method to various ternary formula families including @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds.@xcite however , unlike the muller and roy maps of @xmath10@xmath1 @xmath8=o , f , and cl , pettifor s map did not lead to a good demarcation between edge - sharing compounds and corner - sharing ones .",
    "furthermore , if edge - sharing compounds not included in his figure ( such as pbsns@xmath1 , basns@xmath1 , pbzrs@xmath1 , and snzrs@xmath1 ) are also considered , demarcations between phases of different motifs becomes even more blurred .",
    "finally , the discovery of the stable edge - sharing phase of srzrs@xmath1 by lee _ et al._@xcite in 2005 also diminishes the distinction between edge- and corner - sharing regions of his map .    in the current paper",
    ", we investigate the disagreement between @xmath20 factor expectations and experimental phase results in @xmath0s@xmath1 and develop a methodology for predicting the ground state structures of @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds and energetically competitive crystal structures that could be reasonably stabilized .",
    "we also calculate the local density approximation ( lda ) band gap for the ground state phase and these alternate phases to highlight the structure - property differences .",
    "in order to determine the ground state structural tendencies of @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds , we first construct a sample subset of 20 compounds .",
    "the @xmath2-sites considered are the group 1 elements k , rb , and cs , the group 2 elements ca , sr , and ba , the group 13 element tl , the group 14 elements sn and pb , and the group 15 element bi . to focus the study , period 4 and 5 @xmath3-site cations",
    "are chosen such that the electron configuration is @xmath4@xmath5 : sc , y , ti , zr , v , and nb . while no combinations of group 1 or tl @xmath2-sites for @xmath0s@xmath1 are known to exist , ( except for tltas@xmath1 with ta outside the scope of this study ) , they are considered as interesting extensions to various ba@xmath3s@xmath1 that do exist : all are as large or larger than ba@xmath22 in 12-fold coordination .",
    "further , @xmath10@xmath1 oxides and halides with @xmath2 = k , rb , and cs do exist .",
    "for each of these compounds , we then arrange the atoms into 22 phases that @xmath10@xmath1 compounds are known to assume .",
    "then , using density functional theory ( dft ) within the lda approximation , we calculate the relative energy of each phase with the abinit computing package.@xcite    the set of 22 phases chosen includes the most common experimentally found corner- , edge- , and face - sharing @xmath23@xmath6 octahedral structures .",
    "the corner - sharing arrangements chosen are the cubic @xmath24 , the tetragonal @xmath25 , the low temperature @xmath26 batio@xmath1 phase and two tilt systems denoted by glazer s naming scheme:@xcite the common @xmath27@xmath28@xmath29@xmath30@xmath29@xmath30 @xmath31 and the low temperature @xmath27@xmath5@xmath27@xmath5@xmath32@xmath30 @xmath33 of srtio@xmath1 .    for edge - sharing systems ,",
    "we consider four phases .",
    "the first , the commonly found nh@xmath9cdcl@xmath1 @xmath31 phase , has as its defining pattern double columns of edge - sharing @xmath3s@xmath6 octahedra , with each octahedron sharing edges with four others .",
    "the second is the @xmath34 phase , which differs from this first phase in that atoms are displaced from high symmetry positions preserving a screw axis symmetry along the direction of the columns .",
    "the third edge - sharing phase is similar to the second , but displacements of atoms in the plane perpendicular to the screw axis are permitted .",
    "this phase is well known for the family of yscs@xmath1 @xmath34 structures , a group of compounds with lanthanide element @xmath2 sites in which the edge - sharing occurs for @xmath2s@xmath6 prisms and the @xmath3s@xmath6 are corner - connected . in order to distinguish between these two phases",
    ", we term them @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , with the @xmath37 ( edge ) and @xmath38 ( corner ) indicating the connectivity of the @xmath3s@xmath6 octahedra .",
    "the remaining edge - sharing phase is a very low symmetry @xmath39 phase found for rbnbo@xmath1 .",
    "four of the face - sharing phases we consider are based on the research of fagot _",
    "et al . _  and ghedira",

    ", they have separated single columns of face - sharing octahedra .",
    "the first three have an orthorhombic lattice .",
    "@xmath40 has @xmath3 cations occupying high symmetry coordinates ( 0 and 0.5 ) in all three cartesian directions leading to collinear @xmath3 cations in the columnar direction ; in @xmath41 , the @xmath3 cations are non - collinear and zigzag about one of the directions perpendicular to the columns ; and in @xmath42 , the @xmath3 cations zigzag in both directions perpendicular to the columns .",
    "the @xmath43 phase is similar to the @xmath40 phase in that both have two mirror planes and one glide plane .",
    "they differ in that @xmath40 is an orthorhombic crystal system with a base - centered bravais lattice , while @xmath43 is a hexagonal crystal system with a simple bravais lattice .",
    "@xmath43 is classified as a minimal non - isomorphic subgroup of @xmath40 .",
    "two other hexagonal face - sharing phases , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are also evaluated .",
    "@xmath45 differs from @xmath43 in that the former allows @xmath3 cation shifts from high symmetry positions in the column direction . for the @xmath44 phase",
    ", there are two distinct sets of columns of face - sharing octahedra which are offset by a 1/4 unit vector in the column direction . thus , in total , six face - sharing phases are evaluated .",
    "the remaining seven phases considered are either one of three types of mixed motif phases , or a corner - sharing tetrahedral phase .",
    "three mixed motif face - sharing and corner - sharing phases are evaluated in this study and are labelled based on the fraction of face - sharing octahedra per unit cell as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "they are most easily visualized by considering their projections on the ( 110 ) plane : the first consists of stacks of three face - sharing octahedra joined at a corner ; the second consists of stacks of two face - sharing octahedra joined at a corner ; and the third consists of alternating stacks of two face - sharing octahedra sharing a corner with a single octahedron . respectively , these phases are known by their structure type names as baruo@xmath1 , bamno@xmath1 , and bafeo@xmath49 . a second type of mixed motif phase , one with mixed edge- and corner - sharing connectivity , is also considered .",
    "the @xmath40 phase of the compound cairo@xmath1 , ( which is proposed to exist under high pressures for mgsio@xmath1),@xcite and its subgroup @xmath42 , ( in which atoms are no longer confined to high symmetry positions along the @xmath50-axis),@xcite have this motif and are respectively designated @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with @xmath53 signifying `` mixed motif '' .",
    "this phase is characterized by planes of @xmath3s@xmath6 octahedra , in which the octahedra are connected by edges in one direction in the plane , and by corners in the other planar direction .",
    "the last mixed motif phase considered is the ilmenite .",
    "this phase , most often characterized by small @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4-metal elements in @xmath0o@xmath14 , has alternating layers of edge - sharing @xmath2o@xmath13 octahedra and edge - sharing @xmath3o@xmath13 octahedra .",

    "this phase is designated @xmath54 .",
    "finally , a pyroxene @xmath55 phase consisting of single columns of zig - zag corner - sharing tetrahedra is included , as all compounds with the @xmath2vo@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = k , rb , cs , and tl ) chemical formula assume this structure .",
    "the elements used in the study are represented in the dft calculations by non - local,@xcite norm - conserving optimized pseudopotentials@xcite created with opium.@xcite the plane wave cutoff energy used for both the pseudopotentials and the dft calculations is 50 ry .",

    "the calculated ground state phases for the 20 @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds are plotted on the muller and roy ionic radii type structure field map in figure [ structmap ] and the pettifor type structure field map in figure [ structmap2 ] . with the exceptions of two @xmath2 = tl based compounds ,",
    "the muller and roy type map demonstrates a well - defined demarcation between the face - sharing and edge - sharing ground state structures . as with the @xmath0o@xmath1 structure maps of muller and roy ,",
    "the face - sharing ground state phase is found only in the regions of large @xmath72 and small @xmath73 .",
    "significantly , no pure corner - sharing perovskite is calculated to be the ground state phase .",
    "only the predicted ground state of the mixed motif corner- and edge - sharing @xmath52 phase for cazrs@xmath1 has any corner - sharing character . even for this compound , the pure edge - sharing phase is slightly favored over the pure corner - sharing phase by 0.007 ev/20-atom unit cell .",
    "the pettifor map improves on the muller and roy type map in the sense that plotting the ground state structure in the pettifor map leads to no overlap between the face- and edge - sharing ground state structures .",
    "however , in the pettifor map ( figure [ structmap2 ] ) the mixed motif corner- and edge - sharing cazrs@xmath1 falls within the edge - sharing region .",
    "tables [ rankme ] and [ rankme2 ] rank , for each compound , the lowest energy phases by motif as obtained by dft where @xmath37@xmath74 = @xmath75(@xmath66 = 0 k ) .",
    "the phonon assessment at the @xmath59-point shows that , except for three compounds , ( @xmath2nbs@xmath1 @xmath2 = k , rb , and tl ) , all of the ground state phases are stable with respect to relaxations within the designated space groups .",
    "for the three cases where stability within the designated space groups was not established , we lifted the space group restriction and perturbed coordinates to obtain relaxed structures that were evaluated as stable .",
    "these were slightly lower in energy by at most 0.009 ev/20-atom unit cell as compared to the higher symmetry structure .",
    "these lower symmetry structures maintain the same motif as their higher symmetry parent structures .",
    "addition of zero - point energies ( zpe ) to @xmath37@xmath74 does not change the rankings .",
    "the @xmath66@xmath76 column indicates the temperature at which the ground state compound and another listed compound have the same free energies as a result of vibrational entropy differences . for many of these phase transitions ,",
    "the lda calculated band gaps for the different phases are significantly different , as can be seen for the compounds with @xmath2 = ba and @xmath3 = ti and zr .    as shown in tables [ rankme ] and [ rankme2 ] , for those compounds which favor the edge - sharing ground state motif , none preferred the @xmath39 phase .",
    "of particular note , the mixed corner- and edge - sharing phase is often found to have a relative energy between the lowest energy edge - sharing phase and the purely corner - sharing phase , perhaps hinting at a transition path between these two motifs . for those compounds which prefer the face - sharing ground state motif , all prefer one of the two orthorhombic phases , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , over the hexagonal phases , excepting the low symmetry phase for rbnbs@xmath1 which is monoclinic with one unit cell angle equal to 90.67@xmath77 . as well , of the compounds that prefer the face - sharing motif , only batis@xmath1 has the mixed motif face- and corner - sharing phases within 1 ev/20-atom unit cell of the ground state phase . indeed , batis@xmath1 has the most phases within 1 ev/20-atom unit cell of the ground state .",
    "an expanded view of its phases is shown in table [ batis3 ] .",
    "no other compound has the corner - sharing octahedral @xmath25 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 phases within 1 ev/20-atom unit cell of the ground state .",
    "finally , absent from tables [ rankme ] and [ rankme2 ] is the corner - sharing tetrahedral @xmath55 phase .",
    "all compounds evaluated in this phase had energies > 1 ev/20-atom unit cell relative to the ground state .    in table",
    "[ newt ] , the standard @xmath20 for the set of 20 compounds used in this study is computed , ranked , and compared to the ground state structural motif . as can be seen from table [ newt ] , there are no overlapping regions of @xmath20 values for edge- and corner - sharing compounds , simply because there are no compounds which have been calculated to have a corner - sharing ground state . with the exception of the tl - based materials , the ground state face- and edge- sharing phases can also be predicted using the standard @xmath20 factor .",
    "we also define the  pettifor factor \" , @xmath78@xmath79 = @xmath80@xmath81/@xmath80@xmath82 , which we define as the ratio of the pettifor s chemical scale values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 and rank the data accordingly . in this scenario ,",
    "the @xmath2 = tl compounds are no longer out of line . moreover , for the set of compounds chosen for this study",
    ", there is a very strong correlation between @xmath80@xmath81 and the ranking of the compounds by @xmath78@xmath79 . as mentioned in the introduction , the standard @xmath20 factor yields overlapping regions of edge- and corner - sharing compounds while the pettifor chemical scales yields multiple regions of edge- and corner - sharing compounds .",
    "the reason ours do not is that existing materials , which have been synthesized at high temperature , are not always created in the ground state , unlike our dft calculations which determine the ground - state energy at @xmath66 = 0  k , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the predictive ability of the tolerance factor can be further enhanced by taking electronegativity into account in a manner similar to pearson,@xcite and specifying a new generalized @xmath20 factor , @xmath83 = @xmath20@xmath84(@xmath8-@xmath2)/@xmath84(o-@xmath2 ) , where @xmath84(@xmath8-@xmath2 ) is the electronegativity difference between @xmath8 = ( s , o ) and @xmath2 , and @xmath84(o-@xmath2 ) is the electronegativity difference between o and @xmath2 .",
    "this results in a ranking of the compounds found in the right side of table [ newt ] .",
    "the same ranking would also be found if the denominator of the ratio , @xmath84(o-@xmath2 ) , was not included in the formula .",
    "however , by including it , @xmath83 remains equivalent to the original @xmath20 for oxides .",
    "a formulation of @xmath83 with a denominator of the ratio set to @xmath84(f-@xmath2 ) , would lead to the same ranking again , but now be based on the absolute ranking of electronegativity of the elements in which f has the most negative value .",
    "this formulation would be more in the spirit of pettifor s chemical scale , but it would lose the transferability back to the historic @xmath20 factor values . along these same lines , the @xmath85 geometric factor in @xmath20 is not needed to produce the rankings for either @xmath20 or @xmath83 , and it loses its significance in phases that have edge- , face- , and mixed - sharing motifs . as with all @xmath20 factors,@xcite",
    "the @xmath83 construct is not perfect , as now the ranking of face - sharing batis@xmath1 and edge - sharing knbs@xmath1 with respect to @xmath83 is reversed ( but only by 0.006 units ) .",
    "several of the 20 compounds considered in our study have been found experimentally to be in a different structural motif phase than the one we calculated as the ground state phase ( batis@xmath1 , @xmath2zrs@xmath1 with @xmath2 = ca , ba , and the misfit @xmath2tis@xmath1 with @xmath2 = sn , pb , and sr ) and others have not yet been synthesized ( all @xmath2@xmath67@xmath3@xmath68s@xmath1 and @xmath2@xmath70@xmath3@xmath70s@xmath1 ) . nevertheless , there is experimental evidence that supports our results , specifically that face - sharing ground state phases have been attained for large @xmath2 and small @xmath3 cations , as well as the preponderance of edge - sharing ground state phases for all other @xmath0 combinations .",
    "our calculations show that the ground state phase of four out of the five @xmath3 = zr compounds in this study is the edge - sharing nh@xmath9cdcl@xmath1 @xmath31 phase .",
    "only the cazrs@xmath1 ground state is different , being of mixed edge- and corner - sharing motif and , even in this case , the next higher energy state is predicted to be the edge - sharing nh@xmath9cdcl@xmath1 @xmath31 phase as well .",

    "_  synthesized edge - sharing srzrs@xmath1 by mixing the constituent elements together in stoichiometric proportions and then heating at 1120 k. performing the same procedures at 1220 k led to the creation of a two - phase material with a major corner - sharing phase and a minor edge - sharing phase.@xcite in 1980 , lelieveld _ et al .",
    "_ flowed h@xmath7s gas over mixtures of binary oxides at 1370 k to create a solely corner - sharing perovskite.@xcite thus , it is probably the differences in processing temperatures and starting materials that led to the different results between these two experiments .",
    "interestingly , in 1963 , clearfield explored the effect of temperature on the synthesis of bazrs@xmath1 , srzrs@xmath1 , and cazrs@xmath1 in a manner similar to that of lelieveld _ et al . _ in clearfield s method , he first combined binary oxides to form @xmath2zro@xmath1 , then used cs@xmath7 gas to replace o with s. he discovered that for synthesis temperatures between 1020 - 1270 k , an unknown phase of bazrs@xmath1 was present in sizable amounts ( 10 - 15% composition of the product ) ; and , for all three , at temperatures below 1270 k , found it impossible to state the space group with certainty.@xcite based on the work of lee _ et al . _ , we suggest that it is possible that clearfield obtained both the corner- and edge - sharing structures within each composition .    in our theoretical study",
    ", we show that for srzrs@xmath1 the corner - sharing phase is preferred at temperatures above 2050  k. with respect to lee s results , our transition temperature at which the corner - sharing phase is preferred over the edge - sharing phase is approximately 900  k too high . though we do calculate a phase change near 1200  k , it is for a change to a mixed motif corner- and edge - sharing one , and not a completely corner - sharing phase .",
    "thus , as our calculation method involves only harmonic @xmath59-point phonon contributions to energy , our errors can be attributed to not including full brillouin zone averaging and anharmonic energy contributions . for pbzrs@xmath1 and snzrs@xmath1 ,",
    "the phase changes from edge - sharing to corner - sharing have similar crossover temperatures to srzrs@xmath1 .",
    "as they have been synthesized as edge - sharing phases at 1070 k,@xcite our study suggests that they can also be made as corner - sharing phases by synthesizing at higher temperatures .    for bazrs@xmath1",
    ", we calculate that the edge - sharing phase is energetically preferred below 90 k. as temperatures in the vicinity of 90 k are too low for synthesis , it would seem that , by itself , a change in synthesis temperature will not lead to the formation of the edge - sharing phase .",
    "while cazrs@xmath1 has only been made in the corner - sharing phase , we have shown that this phase is not energetically preferred over the edge - sharing phase or the mixed motif phase at any temperature .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to achieve these other phases of cazrs@xmath1 through either lower synthesis temperatures alone or in combination with other changes in synthesis procedures such as increased pressure .",
    "supporting this idea is the existence of another @xmath86 compound with @xmath2 = ca , cairo@xmath1 , which is created in the mixed edge- and corner - sharing phase through the use of elevated pressures.@xcite    next , we compare our theoretical space group and structure predictions of stoichiometric ternary sulfides in which the @xmath2 cations have a lone pair electron configuration , ( and with @xmath3 not equal to zr ) , with experimental literature for those systems where non - stoichiometric phases are reported .",
    "for @xmath0s@xmath1 with @xmath2 cations that possess a lone pair , ( pb , sn , and bi ) , the nonstoichiometric phases are chiefly composed of single sheets of edge - sharing @xmath3s@xmath6 octahedra with a chemical formula of @xmath3s@xmath7 separated by single or multiple planes of distorted rock salt @xmath2s.@xcite an important point of agreement is that our calculations also predict an edge - sharing structure for each of these .",
    "however , the stoichiometric phases prefer pairs of columns of edge - sharing octahedra , rather than the sheets seen in the misfit compounds . despite this difference , there is experimental evidence that these two findings are compatible . wiegers and meerschaut synthesized ( las)@xmath87@xmath3s@xmath7 ( @xmath3 = ti , v , and cr ) misfits under atmospheric pressure conditions.@xcite kikkawa _",
    "formed stoichiometric la@xmath3s@xmath1 in the edge - sharing nh@xmath9cdcl@xmath1 phase for the same @xmath3 species by applying high pressure to the mixture of reactants.@xcite thus , the elevated pressure synthesis method of kikkawa _ et al . _",
    "is probably necessary for the stoichiometric @xmath0s@xmath1 formation of the systems containing @xmath2 = pb , sn , and @xmath3 = ti .    the compounds in our study in which the @xmath2 cations have a lone pair configuration , ( and with @xmath3 not equal to zr ) , also have another common feature .",
    "our calculations show that several of them transition from the edge - sharing phase to the mixed motif edge- and corner - sharing phases at similar temperatures : 1150 k , 1120 k , and 1420 k for pbtis@xmath1 , biscs@xmath1 , and biys@xmath1 respectively .",
    "tlnbs@xmath1 has the same phase transition at a higher temperature , 1960 k. as well , catis@xmath1 , which does not have a lone pair for @xmath2 = ca , also exhibits the potential for this transformation , at 305 k.    in order to evaluate our results for the six compounds which are found to have the face - sharing motif as the lowest energy phase , we separate them into two groups : five with group i @xmath2 = ( cs , rb , and k ) , which have not been made experimentally in any phase , and batis@xmath1 , which has been synthesized by multiple research groups .",
    "the face - sharing ground state of these group i compounds is similar to the related face - sharing structures of @xmath0cl@xmath1 , with different @xmath3 .",
    "they do not have the @xmath55 structural motif of their @xmath0o@xmath1 analogs , ( single columns of corner - sharing tetrahedra for @xmath3 = v ) , nor the double columns of edge - sharing octahedra for @xmath3 = nb .",
    "this indicates that the face - sharing motif is not only a function of size of group i @xmath2 , but a function of the @xmath8 size as well : both cl@xmath88 and s@xmath89 are very large and quite close in size in different environments : their ionic radii are 1.81 and 1.84   respectively , when adopting a coordination of 6;@xcite and their covalent radii are 0.99 and 1.02   respectively.@xcite a notable difference between the sulfides and their chloride analogs is that the latter form mostly in a hexagonal lattice , rather than an orthorhombic one .",
    "an interesting exception is rbcrcl@xmath1 , which is nearly orthorhombic at room temperature with a monoclinic classification and an angle deviation from 90@xmath90 of @xmath213@xmath90.@xcite in conjunction with this observation , we have found that the lowest energy phase for rbnbs@xmath1 is also monoclinic albeit with a smaller angle deviation from 90@xmath90 , 90.67@xmath90 .",
    "for the lone group ii @xmath2 that assumes a face - sharing ground state , batis@xmath1 , we find that it prefers the orthorhombic c222@xmath91 space group . in the experimental literature , on the other hand",
    ", it is listed in one of two hexagonal space groups , @xmath92@xmath1@xmath93 or @xmath45.@xcite however , clearfield has noted that at lower temperatures of synthesis ( @xmath21970 k ) , the compound could be characterized with either orthorhombic or hexagonal indexing.@xcite as the synthesis temperature was increased to 1370 k , only hexagonal characterization was plausible .",
    "thus , similarly to srzrs@xmath1 , the structure of batis@xmath14 is sensitive to changes in the synthesis temperature .",
    "further , both fagot _",
    "et al . _ and ghedira _ et al",
    "_ have shown experimentally that an analog of batis@xmath1 , bavs@xmath1 , undergoes a phase change from hexagonal @xmath92@xmath1@xmath93 phase to an orthorhombic phase ( either @xmath42 or @xmath41 ) when temperature is lowered below @xmath21250 k.@xcite since our dft calculations are performed at 0  k , our batis@xmath1 results are consistent with their findings and also explain the calculated preferred orthorhombic phases as opposed to hexagonal phases for the group i face - sharing compounds .",
    "proposed that bavs@xmath1 changes to a @xmath94 phase as the temperature is lowered below 70  k.@xcite to test whether this phase was possible for batis@xmath14 , we performed a relaxation of batis@xmath1 assuming the @xmath94 phase and found that it was slightly lower in energy ( @xmath95e < 0.002 ev/20-atom unit cell ) than the previously calculated @xmath41 ground state ; however , the @xmath59-point phonon calculation showed that this phase was not stable at 0  k. these analyses also demonstrate one limitation of our work : when many phases are similar in energy , our free energy approximation can reorder the phases .    as is shown in table [ batis3 ] , the mixed motif face- and corner - sharing phases for batis@xmath1 energy levels fall between the wholly face - sharing phases and the wholly corner - sharing phases . the compound s oxide analog , batio@xmath1 ,",
    "is most often cited to be a corner - sharing phase compound .",
    "it is worthy of note that batio@xmath1 has also been processed in the @xmath48 phase , which is more formally known as the bafeo@xmath96 phase.@xcite thus , our results are consistent with the literature analogs . more importantly though",
    ", our calculations indicate that phase changes are possible from face- to corner - sharing motifs , as we calculate transition temperatures from the @xmath41 phase to the @xmath26 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 phases in the 340 - 375 k range . based on the dft calculations",
    ", we propose that batis@xmath1 will be found to be a highly structurally flexible material when synthesized by different experimental methods .",
    "from a set of 22 phases known for @xmath10@xmath1 compounds , we found that , for @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds in which the @xmath3 element has a @xmath4@xmath5 electronic configuration , the preferred phase for all but the largest @xmath2 cations and smallest @xmath3 cations are the edge - sharing @xmath34 and nh@xmath9cdcl@xmath1 @xmath31 phases .",
    "these sulfides differ from their oxide counterparts , which favor corner - sharing phases .",
    "to predict the preferred structural motifs , we developed a modified goldschmidt tolerance factor @xmath83 .",
    "this incorporates the electronegativity difference between the @xmath2 cation and s , but retains the original @xmath20 for oxides , by normalizing the difference in electronegativity between the @xmath2 cation and o. this formulation leads to a neat demarcation between the compounds that prefer a face - sharing ground state and those that prefer an edge - sharing one .",
    "several of the @xmath0s@xmath1 combinations have phases with different motifs that are within 1 ev/20-  atom unit cell of the energy of the ground state phase .",
    "vibrational entropy calculations show that these phases might be achievable under different synthesis conditions than the ones already present in the literature . for the smaller @xmath2 and @xmath3 cation combinations in @xmath0s@xmath1 , high synthesis temperatures under ambient pressure conditions , often with oxide intermediates or binary oxide starting materials ,",
    "have led to products with the corner - sharing motif forming or to incommensurate phases .",
    "experimental evidence shows that combinations of high pressure , lower processing temperatures , non - oxide starting materials , and long processing times tend to favor the synthesis of the commensurate edge - sharing motif .",
    "we suggest that two of the sulfides that are evaluated in this paper , ( bazrs@xmath1 and cazrs@xmath1 ) , are candidate compounds that may be produced as edge - sharing phases in this manner .",
    "conversely , though pbzrs@xmath1 and snzrs@xmath1 have been synthesized as edge - sharing compounds , higher synthesis temperatures could produce corner- and mixed motif corner- and edge - sharing phases .",
    "lastly , batis@xmath1 might achieve both hexagonal and orthorhombic face - sharing motifs and corner - sharing motifs when subjected to different synthesis temperatures .",
    "thus , not only does the family of @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds show structural diversity , but even the individual @xmath0s@xmath1 compounds themselves exhibit structural diversity with multiple stable phases .",
