    "the transition between the dipolar dynamo regime and a non - dipolar regime was first pointed out by kutzner and christensen in 2002 .",
    "they observed through direct numerical experiments two different regimes of dynamo action .",
    "one , at moderate forcing , characterized by a steady large scale dipole and the other , with a more vigorous forcing , revealing multipolar solutions and chaotic reversals of the dipolar component .",
    "the existence of these two regimes and their possible relevance to the geodynamo is a central problem in geomagnetism .",
    "christensen and aubert ( 2006 ) found through a wide parameter space survey that this transition is controlled by the relative strengths of inertial and coriolis forces , as measured by the so called `` local rossby number '' .",
    "more recently , soderlund _",
    "( 2012 ) argued that the coriolis force was dominant in both regimes , and suggested , instead , that the transition was controlled by the relative strengths of inertial to viscous forces , both of lower amplitude .    in this letter , we use a wide database of 132 fully three dimensional direct numerical simulations ( kindly provided by u. christensen ) to address this apparent contradiction .",
    "we argue that both interpretations are in fact equivalent if one considers the non - gradient part of the forces balance only .",
    "this is easily achieved by considering the curl of the relevant forces .",
    "the fluid being incompressible , the gradient part of any force will obviously be balanced by pressure forces .",
    "our study relies on a database of numerical simulations performed in a spherical shell of typical width @xmath3 and aspect ratio @xmath4 .",
    "the flow is thermally driven by an imposed difference of temperature between the inner and outer spheres .",
    "these simulations rely on no - slip mechanical boundary conditions , and an insulating outer domain . most of simulations involve an insulating inner core , a few of them involve a conducting inner core with the same conductivity as the fluid .    the governing equations in the rotating reference frame",
    "can then be written in their non - dimensional form  using @xmath5 as unit of length ,",
    "@xmath6 as unit of time , @xmath7 as unit of temperature , and @xmath8 as unit for the magnetic field  as @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11    these equations involve four non - dimensional numbers : the ekman number @xmath12 the prandtl number @xmath13 the magnetic prandtl number @xmath14 and the rayleigh number @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath17 the coefficient of thermal expansion , @xmath18 the gravity at the outer bounding sphere , @xmath19 its thermal diffusivity , and @xmath20 its magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the database used for this study covers the parameter range @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 $ ] , and is restricted to @xmath23 we therefore can not distinguish any possible dependence on the prandtl number @xmath24 from our analysis .",
    "the dipolarity of the magnetic field is well quantified by @xmath25 , which corresponds to the time - averaged ratio of the mean dipole field strength to the field strength in harmonic degrees @xmath26 at the outer bounding sphere ( see christensen and aubert , 2006 ) .",
    "we also introduce the rossby number @xmath27 , defined using time - averaged quantities as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the volume average over the shell .",
    "christensen and aubert ( 2006 ) empirically show that the transition from the dipolar regime to the non - dipolar regime occurs at @xmath30 ( which becomes @xmath31 with our definition of the time scale ) , where @xmath32 denotes the local rossby number , defined as @xmath33 .",
    "this transition was also shown to work with stress free boundary conditions ( schrinner _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "the typical length scale of the flow @xmath34 is here defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 corresponds to the mean value of the spherical harmonics degree @xmath37 in the time - averaged kinetic energy spectrum ( see equation  ( 27 ) in christensen and aubert , 2006 ) . figure  [ fdip_ro].a represents the dipolarity @xmath25 as a function of @xmath32 , when applied to the @xmath38 dynamos database .",
    "versus ( a ) the local rossby number @xmath32 as defined by christensen and aubert ( 2006 ) , ( b ) the local rossby number @xmath39 as defined by oruba and dormy ( 2014 ) .",
    "red circles ( resp . blue squares ) correspond to @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "@xmath41 ) .",
    "these graphs rely on the @xmath38 dynamos database.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the above definition of @xmath34 is anisotropic as it does not take the radial variations into account .",
    "indeed it only involves the spherical harmonics degree @xmath37 of the spectral decomposition .",
    "moreover , this calculus relies on a radial averaging : the role of the radius @xmath42 in the length scale associated to a given angular scale is thus not taken into account .",
    "oruba and dormy ( 2014 ) introduced the kinematic dissipation length scale , denoted here as @xmath43 , defined using time - averaged quantities as @xmath44 contrary to @xmath34 , this length scale @xmath45 is isotropic . using the @xmath38 dynamos database ,",
    "the two length scales are found roughly proportional , with @xmath46  : as expected @xmath47 .",
    "we can then introduce the local rossby number @xmath39 , defined as @xmath48 .",
    "the transition between the dipolar regime and the multipolar regime occurs for @xmath39 closer to unity ( see figure  [ fdip_ro ] ) .",
    "the role of the local rossby number in the dipolar - multipolar transition obviously relates to a dominant forces balance between inertial and coriolis forces in the navier - stokes equation  ( [ eq_ns ] ) .",
    "this transition is associated with a breakdown of the dominant dipolarity of the dynamo as inertia increases , but it happens when inertial forces are still too small to suppress the columnar structure of convection .",
    "this subsequent hydrodynamic breakdown occurs at larger forcing and is discussed in soderlund _",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the transition between the dipolar regime and the multipolar regime is then expected to occur when the non - gradient part of inertial forces is of the same order of magnitude as that of the coriolis force .",
    "this statistical equilibrium can be expressed by considering the curl of this forces balance , it provides @xmath49 which can be rewritten as @xmath50 clearly @xmath43 , as occuring in this relation , corresponds to the dissipation length scale defined in ( [ ldissu ] ) and not to the often used @xmath34 . in the following",
    ", we will thus only consider the length scale @xmath45 .",
    "below and at the transition , it is natural to assume @xmath51 .",
    "this implies @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a non - dimensional length scale which depends on correlations between the velocity and the vorticity .",
    "this length scale is thus an intricate quantity , which can not be easily estimated a priori .",
    "note that assuming that @xmath54 is tantamount to writing the balance between inertial forces and the coriolis force without taking the curl of each term .",
    "king and buffett ( 2013 ) have shown that in numerical simulations , the typical length scale of the flow @xmath55 verifies @xmath56 . the scaling is even more naturally satisfied by the dissipation length scale @xmath57    the @xmath58scaling stems from the equilibrium between the non - gradient part of the viscous force and the coriolis force @xmath59 which provides @xmath60 this implies @xmath61 which is well verified by dipolar dynamos ( @xmath40 ) in the database ( see figure  [ lue13 ] ) .     as a function of the ekman number .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "this plot relies on a subset of @xmath63 dynamos , corresponding to @xmath40.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "because of this dominant balance between viscous forces and the coriolis term , valid in the dipolar regime , the transition to multipolar dynamos necessarily also corresponds to a balance between inertial and viscous forces .",
    "the statistical equilibrium between the non - gradient part of inertial and viscous forces provides @xmath64 which can be rewritten as @xmath65 and corresponds to @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the reynolds number ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "figure  [ fdip_rel2].a supports the above relation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the parameter on the left of ( [ equil_inertievisc ] ) is not the local reynolds number ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "relation ( [ equil_inertievisc ] ) relies on the curl of the forces balance , and contrasts with a transition corresponding to a simple balance between inertial and viscous forces .",
    "such a naive balance would not filter the gradient parts and would yield the local reynolds number @xmath70 as relevant parameter .",
    "such a scenario is obviously not supported by the numerical database ( see figure  [ fdip_rel2].b )",
    ". taking the curl of the navier - stokes equation  ( [ eq_ns ] ) is therefore necessary before writing balances between these forces , in order to filter out the gradient part of the dominant forces .",
    "versus ( a ) @xmath2 and ( b)@xmath70 .",
    "red circles ( resp . blue squares ) correspond to @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "@xmath41 ) .",
    "these graphs rely on the @xmath38 dynamos database .",
    "this figure stresses the importance of considering the curl of the forces balance in order to filter out the gradient parts in equilibrium with pressure forces.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "it is quite clear from the above discussion that the transition between dipolar and multipolar dynamos occurs when the curl of inertial forces becomes comparable to both the curl of the coriolis and of the viscous term , which were both in balance in the dipolar regime .",
    "as the rayleigh number is increased , the role of inertia becomes more and more important , until the three forces balance is reached .",
    "indeed , replacing @xmath71 by @xmath72 in ( [ equil_inertiecor ] ) and ( [ equil_inertievisc ] ) yields the sole relation @xmath73 this expression reveals the existence of a single parameter to describe the transition .",
    "we represent the dipolarity as a function of this parameter in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "this parameter provides a remarkable description of the transition .",
    "this vindicates the above scenario with a dominant balance between three terms at the transition , that is the non - gradient part of inertial , viscous and coriolis forces .     versus the sole parameter @xmath74 , revealing the three forces balance at the transition .",
    "red circles ( resp . blue squares ) correspond to @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "@xmath41 ) .",
    "this figure relies on the @xmath38 dynamos database.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "it is important to ponder on the applicability of the above transition to the earth s core , as this can shed light on the relevance of available numerical models to geophysical observations .",
    "we use the typical estimates for the earth s core @xmath75 ( olson , 2007 ) and @xmath76 , which corresponds to a typical rms velocity in the core of @xmath77 ( order of magnitude obtained by inverting secular variation data , see bloxham _",
    "et al . _ , 1989 , and christensen and aubert , 2006 ) . a direct estimate of the parameter @xmath78 then provides a typical value of @xmath79 .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous work of christensen ( 2010 ) , which argued that the earth s core would lie below , but close to the dipolar - multipolar transition .",
    "the vicinity to the critical value for transition to the multipolar state has been argued to be a possible reason for reversals of the earth s magnetic field ( christensen , 2010 ; wicht and tilgner , 2010 ) .",
    "it is important to note however that the resulting viscous length scale would be extremely small , less than @xmath80 m. it is difficult to imagine that quasi - geostrophic structures would be stable in the earth s core on such small length scales .",
    "the viscous balance advocated here is usually ruled out for the earth s core , for which a magnetostrophic balance ( between the non - gradient part of the coriolis and the lorentz terms ) is sought ( see for a detailed discussion oruba and dormy , 2014 ) . according to figure  [ fig4 ] , such models extended to the earth s core would produce a dynamo dominated by a strong dipole , yet close enough to the multipolar region to exhibit reversals ( see also christensen , 2010 ) . presently available numerical models however appear to rely on a dominant forces balance , involving viscous forces , which is not relevant to the earth s core .",
    "magnetostrophic numerical models still need to be produced .",
    "we offer a unified description of the dominant forces balances at work in numerical dynamos and of the transition between the regime of steady dipolar dynamos and that of multipolar fluctuating dynamos .",
    "we show that it corresponds to a balance between three forces , i.e. the non - gradient part of inertial , viscous and coriolis forces .",
    "this balance can be estimated by taking the curl of the dominant forces .",
    "we derive from this three terms equilibrium the parameter @xmath0 which provides an accurate description of the transition .    using a measured length scale in the numerical models ,",
    "the transition can be equivalently described by @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 ) , which correspond to the two forces balance between the non - gradient part of inertial ( resp .",
    "viscous ) and coriolis forces .",
    "the transition occurs when these parameters are order one , i.e. the forces are of comparable amplitude",
    ".    a more accurate description of the transition would require the knowledge of the correlation length scale @xmath53 which is complex to determine .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] indicates that this non - dimensional length scale is of order unity in the numerical database used in our study .",
    "it may be a function of other parameters ( e.g. the prandtl number pr   which is kept constant here ) .",
    "further analysis of this correlation length scale in direct numerical simulations could provide a finer description for the transition .",
