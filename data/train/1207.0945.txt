    "the tunneling of a particle through a potential barrier is one of the most fundamental processes in quantum mechanics.@xcite research on transport experiments in semiconductor quantum dots @xcite relies on the tunneling effect as a requirement to measure a charge current through these devices .",
    "the transmission of the tunnel barriers themselves can be investigated in detail over orders of magnitude e.g.  by counting electrons entering and leaving the quantum dot with a nearby charge detector .",
    "@xcite the properties of quantum dots coupled via a tunnel barrier to the leads can be studied not only with direct current ( dc ) bias , @xcite but also at finite frequency , measuring the complex admittance , @xcite giving information about the dynamics of the electrons in the system .",

    "@xcite a theoretical treatment of this dynamic admittance using a scattering matrix approach @xcite has led to the proposal that for large ratios between excitation frequency and tunnel rate , inductive as well as capacitive behavior should be observable in these systems .",
    "@xcite such effects are expected to be more pronounced at higher frequencies.@xcite    in this paper we present measurements of the finite frequency response of a single quantum dot for different tunnel rates to a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . in particular , we investigate in detail the dynamic admittance of a double quantum dot arising between one dot and its lead when the other dot is detuned such that its influence can be neglected .",
    "these measurements are in a different regime in comparison to those in ref .  , where only the dynamic coupling between the two dots and microwave photons was investigated and the coupling to the leads was irrelevant . the capacitive coupling to an on - chip high - quality transmission line resonator is used for the measurement .",
    "such resonators have been shown to be excellent devices for realizing strong coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite and quantum non - demolition readout @xcite of superconducting qubits .",
    "we find that in the vicinity of a conductance resonance @xcite between the lead and the dot , the resonant frequency of the microwave resonator shifts both up and down in frequency , depending on the dot - lead tunnel rate .",

    "the resonances to the right lead are more pronounced than those to the left lead .",
    "this is expected because the resonator is more strongly capacitively coupled to the right quantum dot than to the left , leading to a higher sensitivity to the tunnel coupling between the right dot and its lead . in region , no charge transfer between the dots and the leads are visible .",

    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) shows that not only a change in amplitude is detected when a state in the right dot is resonant with the lead but also a change in phase .",
    "since the measurement frequency is set to @xmath15 , such a change in phase corresponds to a change in resonance frequency .",
    "this frequency shift can be caused by reactive as well as dissipative changes in the impedance of the right dot tunnel - coupled to its lead , discussed in more detail below .",

    "we find a dynamic admittance @xmath30 with only a capacitive component for the most transparent tunnel barrier of the three measurement sets presented in fig .",
    "the model also reproduces the crossover from a capacitive to an inductive behavior as the tunnel rate is reduced . for @xmath30 the transition between inductive and capacitive behavior is shifted down from the ghz to the few tens of mhz - range due to the presence of the additional capacitances @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    in the following we try to give an intuitive explanation for the appearance of an inductive and a capacitive response in the vicinity of a conductance resonance .",
    "the decisive parameter for the external response to be inductive or capacitive close to resonance with the lead , is the ratio between the photon energy @xmath51 and the tunnel coupling @xmath37 .",
    "as @xmath37 decreases at fixed frequency @xmath69 , the dwell time in the dot of a resonantly tunneling electron becomes longer .",
    "if this dwell time exceeds the period of the driving field , the electron can no longer follow the drive , the resulting current lags behind the voltage , and the response tends to be more and more inductive .",
    "this behavior may be interpreted as the quantum tunneling analogue of the kinetic inductance of an electron gas which is due to the inertia of the electrons causing the same lag between current and voltage .",
    "however , in our resonant structure this inductive effect competes with the well - known quantum capacitance contribution to the response caused by the tunneling broadened spectral density of the resonant state . the capacitive response prevails with increasing detuning from resonance , where tunneling of electrons into the dot has an increasing character of virtual transitions ( elastic cotunneling ) happening on very short time scales given by the detuning energy",
    ".    comparing figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( d ) and ( f ) we find the measured curve ( 3 ) to be slightly broader in gate voltage than the corresponding calculated trace .",
    "also the capacitive reactance in case ( 1 ) is slightly less pronounced in the measurement than in the calculated curve .",
    "such differences between the scattering matrix model and the measurements could have a number of origins .",
    "firstly the model does not consider any sources of decoherence and noise .",
    "secondly the assumption of a breit - wigner phase dependence @xcite , which is based on a single resonance , may be an oversimplification .",
    "detailed analysis of the resonator linewidth gives access to dissipative effects described by the real part of the dynamic admittance .",
    "for dataset ( 2 ) we obtain good agreement between model and data ( not shown ) using the same parameters which describe the resonator frequency shift in fig .",
    "the model underestimates the dissipation by less than a factor 2 in the other two cases .",
    "however , a comparison of the measured phase and amplitude changes in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) and ( d ) shows already that the dissipative effects may be harder to describe than the reactive effects . while the latter show a systematic and steady evolution from the case of purely capacitive response to the case of inductive response with decreasing gate voltage , the dissipative effects vary strongly in the same gate voltage range .",
    "while we do not have a clear explanation for this effect at present , we point out that charge relaxation , which is still under investigation,@xcite is believed to play an essential role for high frequency resistance measurements .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the tunneling process between a quantized state and the continuum for different tunnel rates . carrying out these measurements using a high frequency resonator enabled us to observe a crossover from a capacitive to an inductive response .",

    "<S> we present microwave frequency measurements of the dynamic admittance of a quantum dot tunnel coupled to a two - dimensional electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are made via a high - quality 6.75 ghz on - chip resonator capacitively coupled to the dot . </S>",
    "<S> the resonator frequency is found to shift both down and up close to conductance resonance of the dot corresponding to a change of sign of the reactance of the system from capacitive to inductive . </S>",
    "<S> the observations are consistent with a scattering matrix model . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the reactance depends on the detuning of the dot from conductance resonance and on the magnitude of the tunnel rate to the lead with respect to the resonator frequency . </S>",
    "<S> inductive response is observed on a conductance resonance , when tunnel coupling and temperature are sufficiently small compared to the resonator frequency . </S>"
