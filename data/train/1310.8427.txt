    "oxide interfaces have received considerable attention within the past couple decades . from the device perspective , many technological applications depend crucially on interfacial properties and the fundamental understanding at the microscopic level is often critical for optimising device performance . in particular oxide interfaces have also offered the opportunity to discover and study completely novel , and often unexpected , fundamental materials physics .",
    "the laalo@xmath0-srtio@xmath0 ( lao - sto ) interface has become a prototypical example of such a system . in bulk",
    "form both oxides are electronically fairly simple non - magnetic insulators .",
    "remarkably , the interface between the two can exhibit metallic  @xcite , magnetic  @xcite and/or superconducting  @xcite behaviour of a quasi - two - dimensional character  @xcite .",
    "it has since been proposed that the lao - sto system may find applications in field effect devices  @xcite , sensors  @xcite , nano - photodetectors  @xcite , thermoelectrics  @xcite , and solar cells  @xcite .",
    "the combination of exotic physical properties and wide - range of potential device applications has made the lao - sto interface a highly popular system of study with several dedicated reviews and perspectives  @xcite .    despite the enormous amount of activity on this system ,",
    "the origin of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the lao - sto interface remains unclear .",
    "arguably the most popular explanation , called the ` electronic reconstruction ' , is based on the concept of a ` polar catastrophe '  @xcite .",
    "the concept uses basic electrostatics ( see section  [ electrostatics ] ) to show that a net charge at a polar , insulating interface such as lao - sto produces a finite non - decaying electric field .",
    "this diverging electrostatic potential is clearly energetically unstable upon increasing thickness of the oxide film . in reality",
    "the system requires some form of charge compensation .",
    "this might occur through an electronic reconstruction ( see section  [ ereconstruction ] ) whereby the electric field produces an electronic transfer similar to zener tunnelling from the surface valence band to the interface conduction band .",
    "this process should not be taken too literally .",
    "the kinetic process of establishing the 2deg can be more involved and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the polar catastrophe and electronic reconstruction concepts establish the paradigm in an intuitive way .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the same mechanism can be seen from a different perspective  @xcite .",
    "there it was noted that the isolated neutral interface and surface should have free carriers associated to them to start with , which ( partly ) annihilate when brought close to each other .",
    "it is an alternative view of the same mechanism , with the same predictions for the equilibrium result , but different perspective on the process .",
    "alternative explanations suggest that charge compensation may be achieved through chemical modifications or chemical plus electronic ( redox ) modifications ( see section  [ sec : redox ] ) . a third category of proposed mechanisms is not based on polarity arguments but instead extrinsic effects induced by the film growth process such as doping through oxygen vacancies or interface cation intermixing ( see section  [ sec : interface ] ) .",
    "clearly the origin of the 2deg is not just of academic interest , but key to understand what other systems might show similar behaviour and how one might be able to tune device properties .",
    "a large number of experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to clarify which mechanism(s ) operates in lao - sto .",
    "a recent short review attempted to summarise the results , concluding that the electronic reconstruction mechanism appears to support experiment  @xcite .",
    "the electronic reconstruction mechanism is certainly strongly supported by several experimental observations , most notably the observation of a critical thickness of the lao film for the onset of interface conductivity  @xcite which can be tuned  @xcite .",
    "however the electronic reconstruction mechanism does not naturally explain all experimental observations .",
    "for example the discovery of a sizeable density of ( trapped ) ti 3@xmath1 like states below the critical thickness  @xcite , the lack of surface hole carriers  @xcite or states near the fermi level  @xcite , the almost negligible electric field within lao below the critical thickness  @xcite , and the apparent disappearance of conductivity at any lao thickness for samples grown at high oxygen partial pressures  @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the situation is not so clear .",
    "the main aim here is to review the findings for this and related systems in the framework of a simple model .",
    "this model describes simply but quantitatively the several effects that concur in the physics of such systems .",
    "in doing so , we hope to better constrain what effects can / cannot explain the observed phenomenology .",
    "it is therefore limited in scope and far from any ambition of being exhaustive in the review of the activity around these systems . in section  [ polar interfaces ]",
    "we briefly introduce the concept of polar interfaces , highlighting for the case of lao - sto the basic theory behind determining the interface net charge and resulting electrostatics .",
    "we then begin by exploring the various proposed mechanisms behind the origin of 2degs at oxide interfaces .",
    "we present a phenomenological model for understanding electronic and/or redox screening of the chemical charge in polar heterostructures in sections  [ ereconstruction ] and  [ sec : redox ] . in section",
    "[ sec : interface ] we discuss the effect of intermixing , both conserving and non - conserving the total stoichiometry .",

    "the @xmath3 axis lies along the [ 001 ] crytallographic direction , which is normal to the surface .",
    "the left panel depicts a pristine interface , together with the electrostatic potential , @xmath4 , it generates , which tends to diverge with increasing lao film thickness .",

    "scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in the seminal paper of ohtomo and hwang  @xcite the discovery of the two - dimensional electron gas at the interface between the two nominally insulating oxides , lao and sto , was rationalised in terms of the electrostatics of the formal charges on each ion , i.e. -2@xmath6 for o , + 4@xmath6 for ti and so on , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] . from these formal charges ,",
    "the ( 001 ) layers in sto ( sro and tio@xmath7 ) are charge neutral whilst in lao ( lao and alo@xmath7 ) they are + 1@xmath6 and -1@xmath6 per layer formula unit . at the ( 001 ) lao - sto interface ,",
    "taking the two unperturbed bulk materials  ,  [ ereconstruction ] and  [ sec : redox ] , respectively . ] , these layer charges give rise to an imbalance at the interface of @xmath8 0.5 @xmath2 .",
    "the sign depends on the interface termination , and @xmath9 is the 2d interface unit cell area corresponding to one formula unit .",
    "these basic arguments , built upon the formal ionic charges , are at the heart of almost all subsequent work on this system .",
    "it is tempting to suggest a renormalisation of these numbers by introducing covalency factors in an attempt to correct for realistic bonding in these far from ideally ionic @xmath10o@xmath0 materials .",
    "it is well known that in most perovskites there is a sizeable covalent bonding character , especially in the @xmath11-o bonds .",
    "one would then find after repeating the basic procedure above an arbitrary value of the interface charge smaller than @xmath8 0.5 @xmath2 .",
    "the first point we wish to highlight here is that when determining the net interface charge in these materials it would be incorrect to include covalency considerations such as that just mentioned ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussion ) . the net interface charge of these band insulators is exactly as obtained from the simple counting of the formal charges on each species irrespective of covalency   using the modern theory of polarisation would be correct , while an analysis based on formal charges alone would not . ] . for lao - sto ,",
    "the net interface charge is precisely 0.5 @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "let us discuss this further .",
    "we outline the arguments proposed in refs .  @xcite . for electrostatics purposes ( see next section ) the calculation of the resulting electric field from an interface requires the knowledge of both the area density of free charges and the total polarisation , or bound charges ( including the electric field response - see next section ) of each material .",
    "the subtlety of the problem comes from what is meant by free charges and the definition of the polarisation .",
    "remember we are considering the unperturbed bulk interface , so zero free charges in a strict sense .",
    "however the free charge can also be defined as anything unaccounted for by the polarisation , and previously called chemical  @xcite or compositional charge  @xcite .",
    "the key to the problem is in the definition of the reference unperturbed ( zero of ) polarisation : altering its value will change the free charge by the same amount . in the end",
    "it is the sum of the two that matters and is unaffected .",
    "centrosymmetric materials such as lao and sto allow for a natural definition of zero polarisation , the _ effective _ polarisation then being the change of polarisation after some perturbation from the centrosymmetric reference . taking the polarisation of sto and lao as zero , one can then use a charge counting technique such as the polarisation - free unit cell method  @xcite to find a free ( or chemical / compositional ) interface charge density of 0.5 @xmath2 .",
    "an alternative viewpoint , that is perhaps more elegant and rigorous , has been proposed  @xcite which considers the _ formal _ polarisation instead of the _ effective _ value above .",
    "the formal polarisation is obtained by direct application of the modern theory of polarisation  @xcite , for example by taking the ionic cores and charge centre of wannier functions  @xcite as point charges .",
    "the difference between the two definitions , effective and formal , for the case of lao - sto is exactly 0.5 @xmath2 : whilst the effective value for lao and sto is zero , the formal values are 0.5 @xmath2 and zero , respectively . within this definition",
    "the free charges are now zero , but the sum of free and bound charges remains 0.5 @xmath2 and hence the resulting electrostatic analysis is unaltered .",
    "we have neglected to mention so far one more subtlety . in a system of discrete point",
    "charges the bulk polarisation is defined only up to quanta of polarisation .",
    "when the definition of the bulk unit cell is displaced along a crystallographic direction and reaches one of the point charges , it disappears there and reappears at the other side of the unit cell . at this point the obtained polarisation jumps by a finite value of @xmath12 which is called a quantum of polarisation , where @xmath13 is the length of the cell along the direction of the flip , and @xmath4 is the cell volume ( polarisation as dipole per unit volume ) .",
    "clearly there is no _ a _ _ priori _ best choice of the unit cell as long as the surface is unknown .",
    "the bulk polarisation value is therefore only defined modulo polarisation quanta . in centrosymmetric perovskites",
    "two sets of formal polarisation values are allowed , @xmath14 as in sto , and @xmath15 as in lao , since these are the only two sets that are invariant under change of sign .",
    "this is the key difference with the effective polarisation as defined above , where all centrosymmetric materials were defined to have 0 polarisation : now they can have 0 or @xmath16 , both modulo @xmath17 .",

    "an alternative approach defines the bulk polarisation of an insulator in terms of a berry phase  @xcite .",
    "this formulation , called the modern theory of polarisation , arises from the consideration of the current that flows through the system when adiabatically changing its polarisation state . in 1984",
    "it was established by berry  @xcite that such an adiabatic change of a hamiltonian is associated with the appearance of a complex phase in the wave - function that describes the system as it adiabatically evolves .",
    "this phase is of deep physical significance and is called a geometric phase , which , in principle can take any value , corresponding to an arbitrary value of the polarisation .",
    "the presence of a symmetry pins the polarisation ( and corresponding phase ) to particular values , and the phase is referred to as topological . in centrosymmetric insulators like lao and sto , the two possible values of the polarisation 0 and @xmath16 ( both modulo @xmath17 ) described in section  [ polarisation ] correspond to the two values of the berry phase , 0 and @xmath20 , modulo @xmath21 .",
    "it is interesting to make the analogy with other symmetry - protected topological phases ( in e.g. topological insulators ) . here",
    "the relevant symmetry is e.g. time - reversal , and the topological phase relates to other properties , e.g. to magnetisation or its susceptibility .",
    "in the conventional table for topological insulators , one axis corresponds to the relevant symmetry , its entries conventionally being time reversal , particle - hole and their product .",
    "arguably , in this table categorising the different symmetry - protected topological phases , spatial symmetries should also feature , which would then include the insulators considered in this review .",
    "it has already been done for two - dimensional systems  @xcite , referring to the quantisation of electric polarisation , as discussed here .",
    "interestingly , for other symmetry groups , as for honeycomb planar insulators ( e.g. bn ) , there are more than two sets of consistent values , three in this case  @xcite .",
    "( there are further topological classifications of insulators based on crystal symmetries , but in a different context to the one of this review  @xcite . ) in analogy with other topological insulators , the interface between two insulators of different topological character in this sense , as lao and sto , gives rise to a 2deg .",
    "of course , such 2degs are not topologically protected against any kind of defect breaking the symmetry defining the phase .",
    "this is analogous to the situation relating to a @xmath22 topological insulator : the 2deg arising on its surface is not protected against defects breaking the time - reversal symmetry , such as magnetic impurities . in this case , the 2deg is affected by regular disorder and defects .",
    "the analogy with other symmetry protected topological phases is best illustrated referring to a  perspective article \" of x. qi in science in 2012  @xcite . here",
    "the concept of a symmetry - protected topological phase is transmitted in terms of the haldane chain , a one - dimensional heisenberg model of localised quantum spins with s=1 , interacting antiferromagnetically . in the ground state for a finite chain , the quantum fluctuations of the local spins act in such a way that the chain appears as if without spins , except for a net spin of @xmath19 at one end and @xmath23 at the other , in spite of their being no @xmath19 particles anywhere in the system .",
    "that system is beautifully analogous to a chain of alternating charges , @xmath24 and @xmath25 some quantum of charge , which is again analogous to the ( 100 ) atomic planes of lao ( see figure 1 of ref .",
    "the net effect is that of half a quantum of charge of either sign at either end , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ chain ] ( the quantum fluctuations in this case manifest themselves on the delocalisation illustrated in the figure for the electrons ) .",
    "the discussion above was centred around the heterostructures grown in ( 001 ) planes because most experiments have been performed for those systems , in addition to the simplicity they offer .",
    "the generalisation to other growth directions is simple , both using formal charges or using polarisation . using formal charges , the argument goes parallel to the original one by ohtomo and hwang  @xcite .",
    "the stacking of [ 001 ] atomic layers in the abo@xmath0 perovskite is ao / bo@xmath7/ao / bo@xmath7 , and thus with formal charges @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , for lao , while they are all neutral for sto .",

    "it is very apparent that both for ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) interfaces there are no possible choices of @xmath32 for both materials such that @xmath37 ; there is always a discontinuity in the polarisation .",
    "consistently with this discussion and in addition to the well - known 2deg in the ( 001 ) case , a 2deg has been recently discovered at the ( 111 ) lao - sto interface  @xcite . in this case , the atomic layers are alternating @xmath38o@xmath0 planes and @xmath11 planes , which for lao means -3 and + 3 layers , while in sto it means -4 and + 4 layers .",
    "there is therefore a discontinuity at the interface corresponding to 0.5 @xmath39 . noting that @xmath40 ( for the @xmath9 as defined in section  [ net charge ] , for the ( 001 ) case ) we see that the formal charges argument , giving a chemical charge of 0.5 @xmath41 , agrees with what obtained from figure  [ cubes ] , namely , @xmath42 .",
    "while a discontinuity in the polarisation exists for ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) interfaces , it is not the case for the ( 011 ) interface for which interfaces with no @xmath32 discontinuity can be built .",
    "this agrees with the consideration from formal charges for which ( 011 ) planes of lao ( sto ) are made of laalo ( srtio ) planes alternating with o@xmath7 planes , i.e. alternating planes of @xmath31 @xmath2 and @xmath30 @xmath2 , in _ both",
    "therefore , as long as a o@xmath7 plane always separates @xmath10o planes , there should be no polarisation discontinuity .",
    "it is interesting , however , that experiments for ( 011 ) interfaces  @xcite show interface conduction similar to what found in the ( 001 ) case , in spite of the fact that according to the discussion in the previous paragraph there should be no polar discontinuity at the pristine interface , and thus no intrinsic tendency to accumulate free carriers at the interface .",
    "the same study  @xcite arrives at an explanation of the effect by a careful structural study of the interface , which shows that it is not an ideal epitaxial ( 011 ) interface , but rather a heavily stepped one , in a jigsaw pattern of ( 001 ) steps and terraces .",
    "these do present the polar discontinuity discussed above , thereby explaining the appearance of the 2deg .",
    "this raises the next question , as to why does this pattern emerge at all if the ideal interface would represent no electrostatic penalty whatsoever .",
    "the answer as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite is likely to be related to the fact that although the ready - made _ interface _ would not be polar , the preformed ideal ( 011 ) _ surface _ of sto is highly so and requires pre - screening , such as the observed formation of the ( 001 ) steps and terraces , before the growth of the film .",
    "finally , the vector lattice above can also be used to predict the polar discontinuities at stepped or vicinal surfaces , as demonstrated in @xcite . the direction normal to",
    "the average interface defines the global polar discontinuity , although if the interface is constituted by well - defined steps separated by wide terraces , the contribution of steps and terraces can be distinguished , allowing for the preparation of one - dimensional electron gases along the steps  @xcite .      in as much as we are defining the polar discontinuity at an interface from the bulk polarisation values , there is the indetermination in the lattice of quanta described above .",
    "however , the formal polarisation can be argued to give a more defined information for a given surface or interface , even an absolute value , as was already proposed by vanderbilt and king - smith  @xcite .    a compelling piece of evidence in this direction is given by the case of the ( 001 ) interface between e.g. ktao@xmath0 ( kto ) and laalo@xmath0 .",
    "taking the formal charges of -2@xmath6 for o , + 1@xmath6 for k and + 5@xmath6 for ta the ( 001 ) layers in kto are + 1@xmath6 ( tao@xmath7 ) and -1@xmath6 ( ko ) per layer formula unit .",
    "both lao and kto are of the @xmath16 kind , and thus one can foresee a non - polar interface . yet , an ideal epitaxial interface , if considering formal charges , would show two @xmath27 layers or two @xmath26 layers together at the interface , since the @xmath38o planes are @xmath26 for lao , but @xmath27 for kto , and vice - versa for the @xmath11o@xmath7 planes . such interfaces would give a net chemical charge of @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "in other words , although an interface between kto and lao could be made without polar discontinuity , it seems the ideal epitaxial one is polar . enhanced carrier densities in interfaces between iii - iii and i - v perovskites",
    "have indeed been predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fact is that when defining a whole system with explicit surfaces , the absolute polarisation is well defined , and can be measured , as the total dipole over the volume of the sample .",
    "the surface theorem essentially says that for specific surface terminations ( and as long as the system remains insulating ) the total polarisation obtained from the wannier charge centres gives the absolute value of the polarisation .",
    "the absolute value of the polarisation is one specific vector from within the lattice discussed in sections  [ polarisation ] and  [ interface planes ] .",
    "this is true as long as the periodicity parallel to each surface is respected .",
    "this should be understood in a strict sense : if any local source of charge ( ion ) is added or removed from the surface , it is done periodically , and therefore respecting charge quantisation per unit cell .",
    "this also holds for interfaces . in the kto / lao example , the ( 001 ) epitaxial interface , i.e. , the one respecting the @xmath38o-@xmath11o@xmath7 plane alternation , gives a polar discontinuity of one whole quantum of polarisation .",
    "however if we were to grow an interface in which the first @xmath11o@xmath7 plane of kto , that is , the tao@xmath7 plane , would grow on a @xmath11o@xmath7 plane of lao ( the alo@xmath7 plane ) , there would be no polar discontinuity .",
    "that is , the termination defines the point in the polarisation set .",
    "polar surfaces and interfaces have been known for many decades .",
    "the description we have reviewed so far started in a seminal paper  @xcite and is linked to the modern theory of polarisation  @xcite but there were previous characterisations of such systems .",
    "the review of goniakowski , finocchi and noguera  @xcite gives an excellent account of the varied descriptions of polar surfaces and interfaces .",
    "for classical point particles one finds these concepts discussed for related situations in the book by born and huang  @xcite .",
    "tasker , in 1979 , offered a characterisation and classification of ideally ionic surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the link between tasker s characterisation and the ideas based on the modern theory of polarisation was recently established by stengel  @xcite .    the treatment for quantum delocalised electrons presents difficulties for some theoretical frameworks , however , related to the problem of how to assign a static charge to the different atoms in a solid .",
    "this is the case for instance of the electron counting models of , e.g. , harrison and coworkers  @xcite by which excess charges were assigned to the cations and anions of heteropolar semiconductors , trying to account for covalency effects .",
    "such techniques were quite successful at a qualitative level when used in conjunction with empirical studies of the electronic structure of materials .",
    "the quantitative determination ( both from first principles and experimentally ) of such quantities however is more problematic , since it involves the assignment of charge to the atoms in the solid , a badly posed problem .",
    "it was attacked with different schemes defining atomic charges , probably the most popular one in recent times being the one by bader  @xcite . for a brief discussion of the ill - definition of static charge schemes in the context of perovskites",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "interestingly , in highly symmetric systems , like cubic lao and sto , such charge redistribution terms cancel and the final result for the polar discontinuity coincides with the @xmath16 value established above . for systems",
    "in which polarisation is not defined by symmetry , it is by no means obvious to us that the calculation of the polarisation discontinuity by means of such charge attributions should agree with the results obtained from the calculation of the formal polarisation .",

    "this discussion will not be pursued any further here .",
    "we conclude this section with a summary of experimental evidence for and against the redox screening mechanism .",
    "we concentrate on the lao - sto system for which there are numerous studies for comparison .",
    "the first expectation from redox screening is obviously that the surface remains insulating ( except for ionic diffusion ) since it is charge compensated by bound charge centres ( e.g. oxygen vacancies ) , whilst the interface is screened by electrons ( which may or may not be mobile ) .",
    "as already mentioned , hole conduction at the lao surface has not been found for any thickness of lao , whilst electronic conduction appears at the lao - sto interface at 4 unit cells of lao or more  @xcite .",
    "ti 3@xmath1 like states ( ti 3 + ) have been observed from spectroscopic measurements even below the 4 unit cells critical thickness , and as thin as just 1 unit cell  @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possibility of the redox screening mechanism appearing almost immediately with lao growth , since with the purely electronic reconstruction one would expect surface hole conduction and only an electronic transfer to the interface once lao is approximately 4 - 6 unit cells thick ( see section  [ ereconstruction ] ) .",
    "it is indeed shown in ref .",
    "@xcite following the same recipe as in section  [ sec : redox ] that the formation of surface oxygen vacancies in lao - sto is likely to occur for lao films as thin as 1 - 3 unit cells thick .",
    "the rapidly increasing interface electron density with film thickness predicted within the redox model ( for a certain range of @xmath150 ) is consistent with the experimental results in ref .",
    "@xcite , where nearly complete screening of the electric field was inferred through the electrostriction effect for films as thin as 6 lao perovskite layers .",
    "this is too thin to be explained by the electronic reconstruction model alone .",
    "if redox formation is indeed responsible for the observed ti 3@xmath1 states , the next question is why for films thinner than 4 unit cells are these electrons not available for conduction .",
    "we briefly mention three possibilities that come to mind .",
    "firstly it has been suggested that the 2deg lies in several ti 3@xmath1 sub - bands , some of which are not mobile due to anderson localisation  @xcite .",
    "the other two mechanisms are related to the experimental observation that the immobile ti 3@xmath1 levels are ` in - gap ' states  @xcite at higher binding energies .",
    "the second possibility is that acceptor defect levels are formed during the lao growth process , such as from cation intermixing ( see section  [ sec : interface ] ) .",
    "cation intermixing has been readily observed in most lao - sto samples  @xcite .",
    "the third possibility is that such states could be formed from the point charge of the surface redox defects which generate trapping potentials as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as the lao film thickness increases the traps change from deep and few to shallow and overlapping .",
    "hence a transition from insulating to conducting occurs at larger lao film thickness than the redox formation itself .",
    "the character of the transition would depend on the charge of the redox defects @xmath191 .",
    "for even @xmath191 ( as in the double - donor case of the oxygen vacancies ) , the transtion would be that of band overlap , whenever the band of filled states would touch the bottom of the conduction band . for odd @xmath191 ( as in the case of oh@xmath110 defects )",
    "the partly filled gap states would undergo an insulator to metal transition of the mott - anderson type  @xcite .",
    "several other recent experimental findings , some of which incompatible with the electronic reconstruction , find natural explanation within the redox screening model .",
    "xps measurements have found very little , if any , evidence for core level broadening or shift with increasing film thickness  @xcite at odds with what one might expect from a constant electric field within lao before the electronic reconstruction critical thickness . within the redox screening model",
    ", it can be trivially shown that the potential drop across the lao film is essentially independent of thickness ( if @xmath150 is small )  @xcite . using the parameters for lao - sto the potential drop for each lao layer added",
    "was predicted to be between 0.0 and 0.2 ev  @xcite , much smaller than within the electronic reconstruction model ( approximately 0.7 - 0.9 ev ) .",
    "the predicted pinning of the potential drop ( and hence reduction in electric field with thickness ) is also consistent with the reduced cation - anion buckling with increasing lao thickness as observed by sxrd  @xcite .",
    "finally we note the observation that the field effect switching of the lao - sto conductivity  @xcite is intimately linked with surface charge writing  @xcite and that the process is dependent on the existence of water in the surface environment  @xcite .",
    "these experiments are likely linked with electrochemical processes  @xcite , and are all compatible with the redox screening model . applying a biased tip to the surface alters the field across the lao film which either increases or decreases the stability of surface redox defects ( and hence interface charge carriers and surface charge ) depending on the sign of the bias .",
    "such electrochemical processes have also been predicted during the switching of ferroelectric thin films  @xcite .",
    "so far we have assumed perfect interfaces _ and _ thin two - dimensional charge distributions . in this section",
    "we explore the effect on the phenomenology of deviations from such assumptions .",
    "sketch of band gap and interface electron density ( red ) vs distance perpendicular to the interface @xmath3.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the free carriers at the interface do screen ( some of ) the chemical charge at the interface , but their quantum spread in @xmath3 generates an interface dipole that has been proposed to alter the relative alignments between lao surface and sto s bottom of the conduction band .",
    "this effect is well described in the literature ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the relevant alignment  @xcite is the one given by the filling of the carrier bands in the 2deg , as illustrated in figure  [ sketch ] .",
    "it depends on the zero - point energy of the band , and therefore on the perpendicular effective mass of the carriers , and on the 2deg band filling , which depends on the carrier density and the parallel effective mass of the carriers .",
    "discussions on the character of the 2deg bands and corresponding effective masses are beyond the scope of this review .      both during and after sample growth",
    "there is the possibility of inter - diffusion of atoms across the interface .",
    "such processes have attracted attention lately  @xcite as one of the possible explanations for the origin of 2d conduction in lao / sto interfaces  @xcite .",
    "the argument used is simply that , since la is a known dopant ( donor ) in sto , la cations diffusing from lao into sto could dope the interface and thus make it conducting .",
    "let us consider here what to expect from ions exchanging across the interface .",
    "this discussion will focus on the effects of having a given inter - diffusion profile in a sample , rather than the energetics and kinetics that might originate it , since equilibrium is not expected to be reached in this aspect .",
    "we shall concentrate here on inter - diffusion situations starting from the pristine stoichiometric interface , and all the exchanges happening within a region around the interface whose width is smaller than other length scales in the problem .",
    "the effects on deviations from stoichiometry , and of diffusion processes from / to reservoirs extrinsic to the interface , are qualitatively different and will be treated briefly in section  [ stoichiometry ] .",
    "based on chemical ( steric ) arguments and on quite a wealth of accumulated knowledge on perovskites , the most likely inter - diffusion processes by far are swaps of like atoms , namely , @xmath11 cations ( al@xmath192 cations in lao substituted by ti@xmath193 , and ti@xmath193 in sto substituted by al@xmath192 ) and @xmath38 cations ( la@xmath192 to sr@xmath194 on one side , sr@xmath194 to la@xmath192 on the other ) .",
    "the swap of o@xmath106 anions across the interface is also likely , but of no consequence .",
    "each cation substitution gives rise to a net bound charge plus a compensating carrier .",
    "la@xmath192 replacing sr@xmath194 gives a @xmath195 centre with an associated electron , thus the donor mentioned in the previous subsection , and so do the other substitutions with obvious sign for their charges .",
    "the first important point to make here is that such inter - diffusion _ should not be expected to dope the interface_. be it @xmath38 or @xmath11 cations swapping across the interface , there will be as many ",
    "wrong \" cations on one side as on the other , and thus as many donors at one side as acceptors at the other .",
    "the electrons of the donors annihilate with the holes of acceptors , as long as both dopants are located in the proximity of the interface , the situation considered here",
    ". similarly , there will be as many ti@xmath193 donors in lao as al@xmath192 acceptors in sto .",
    "the inter - diffusion will then originate a distribution of fairly immobile charges at both sides of the interface , with zero total charge , since there are as many @xmath195 s as @xmath196 s .",
    "indeed it is well known that the lao - sto solid solution is insulating .    while intermixing is not expected to dope the interface",
    ", it can have implications for the _ transport _ properties and critical thickness of an interface 2deg appearing by means of another mechanism .",
    "this is likely since the intermixing can produce the aforementioned trapping acceptor states lying below the conduction band of the pristine interface .",
    "the second important point to make here is that such inter - diffusion does affect the electrostatics , but only in the interface region",
    ". it does not affect the electric field emanating from it into the film .",
    "this is a direct consequence of gauss s law : the net flux of the electric displacement field across surfaces parallel to the interface equals the net charge contained in the region within them . in the absence of charges diffusing in from other regions ,",
    "the net charge per unit area is still @xmath59 , and the field emanating from the interface into the film is again @xmath197 , ( the field in the substrate being zero ) .",

    "[ last expression ] is that in a system like lao / sto , with @xmath230 , the width of the cation distribution in sto hardly affects the final shift is unaltered by intermixing either side of the film which is likely inaccurate  @xcite .",
    "deviations from such assumptions can be trivially added to the model . ] , @xmath231    considering now a lao film of thickness @xmath1 , this expression implies that the field across the film will be noticeably screened by cation inter - diffusion if ( @xmath232 ) @xmath233 @xmath2 , i.e. a very substantial amount of ti@xmath193 going into lao , and ( @xmath234 ) @xmath235 , i.e. ti cations penetrate the whole film .",
    "indeed , perfect screening would only be possible if half a monolayer of ti cations all traversed the whole film to sit on the surface , while their al counterparts would go to the sto side staying close to the interface .",
    "such cases were confirmed to screen the field within the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , and were obviously found to be quite stable and even exothermic . whether these swaps across the whole film actually happens depends on the kinetics of the process .",
    "if in the growth process there is a cationic imbalance giving rise to a net deviation of the compositional charge , the effect is a trivial renormalisation of @xmath59 . unlike the previous cases , where there were charge redistributions around the interface , with no change in the net charge , this section considers effects that alter the total interfacial charge .",
    "recently several studies have discussed the role of la : al off - stoichiometries , which can be modulated by the laser parameters of the pulsed laser deposition , on the carrier density  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that when the la / al ratio differs from unity by just a few percent , the carrier density can drop by two orders of magnitude .",
    "it is clear that cation vacancies will affect @xmath59 , induce acceptor states and hence reduce the interface carrier density .",
    "a concentration of just 2% @xmath38-site vacancies across the whole of a lao film of 10 unit cells would correspond to a charge close to the half a quantum 0.5 @xmath2 .",
    "further discussion is beyond the scope of this paper and we refer the reader to more detailed studies  @xcite of various types of non - stoichiometric lao - sto systems .",
    "these studies show that several types of defect structures are thermodynamically stable , for example the combined la vacancy at the lao interface and o vacancy at the alo@xmath7 surface , which screen the internal electric field and in some cases remove the interface carriers .",
    "in fact , this last kind of combined defects at surface and interface represent a similar charge screening mechanism to the ones modelled within this review : instead of the scenario of surface o vacancies and interface free electron carriers , it is surface o vacancies and interface cation vacancies .",
    "the equilibrium occurrence of such combined defects can be treated with the same model ( the @xmath122 parameter would now include the combined formation energy of both defects ) , but the key difference is that this mechanism does not produce carriers for the 2deg .    it is likely that in several systems there also exists a total deficit of oxygen , via the creation of oxygen vacancies in the substrate during the growth process or by other means , even if they are not stabilised or favoured by the electrostatics . here",
    "each vacancy , which is likely created near the substrate surface , creates two electrons which are loosely bound near the vacancy .",
    "these processes have been suggested to play a role in lao - sto when grown under insufficient oxygen partial pressure  @xcite .",
    "they may also be created at the bare sto surface when subject to ultraviolet light irradiation  @xcite or vacuum cleaved  @xcite .",
    "the unexpected conductivity observed at the non - polar interface between an _ amorphous _ lao film and a crystalline sto substrate  @xcite has recently also been explained as the creation of oxygen vacancies in the sto substrate during the growth process  @xcite . if the system is subjected to post - growth annealing in oxygen , which presumably removes these vacancies , the conductivity is no longer observed  @xcite .",
    "these processes are also possibly happening in other heteroepitaxial non - polar oxide systems  @xcite .",
    "interestingly alterations in the net charge can also arise if there are half - unit - cell steps at the interface , with both @xmath93 and @xmath94 interface terraces .",
    "in such case there is a continuous variation of @xmath59 , from @xmath5 to @xmath236 , depending on the ratio of interface area covered by each kind , including a total removal of the polarisation discontinuity for the case of the interface being composed by half @xmath93 and half @xmath94 interfaces . for the cancellation to be effective , though",
    ", the width of the terraces should be smaller than the film thickness .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed the present understanding on the origin of a 2deg observed at the epitaxial interface between certain perovskite insulator thin films and certain perovskite insulator substrates , referring mostly to the paradigmatic case of an lao film on sto .",
    "the  polar catastrophe \" concept and existing evidence for and against it have been reviewed .",
    "the polarisation discontinuity of half a quantum of polarisation ( for lao on sto ) is obtained from the surface theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the symmetry of the bulk systems .",
    "this construction is related to other symmetry - protected topological phases appearing in other contexts , namely , the topological insulators related to other symmetries as time reversal and/or particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the discussion is generalised from the conventional ( 001 ) orientation of the interface to any orientation via the lattice of meaningful polarisation vectors for these insulators , including high - index vicinal ( stepped ) interfaces .",
    "alternative descriptions and formulations for the polar discontinuity found in the literature are reviewed and compared with the one based on formal polarisation .",
    "the polar catastrophe makes the pristine film unstable towards electric - field screening mechanisms based on surface and interface charges , the latter being the electron carriers of the 2deg .",
    "the review of such instabilities is upheld by a simple model , following on refs .",
    "@xcite , starting from the electronic reconstruction , followed by the redox - defect model , and their possible coexistence .",
    "the model is generalised to arbitrary homogeneous surface - interface charging mechanisms .",
    "finally , the effect of deviations from the ideal epitaxial growth ( interface effects ) are reviewed , distinguishing between deviations respecting stoichiometry ( such as inter - diffusion across the interface ) , which do not alter the qualitative situation described by the polar catastrophe and surface - interface charge screening , and deviations that do alter stoichiometry on a substantial scale .",
