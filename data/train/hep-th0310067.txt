    "the problem of the diverging coulomb field and self - energy of point particles in maxwell s theory of electrodynamics led born and infeld in the 1930s to the construction of a non - linear extension of this theory @xcite in which a regularization is achieved because the field strength tensor @xmath1 appears to all orders .",
    "a particular appeal of born - infeld electrodynamics is that its action can be expressed in the compact determinantal form @xmath2 and , more importantly , it stems from the fact that the dirac - born - infeld action resurfaces in string theory as the low energy effective action @xcite on the worldvolume of @xmath3-branes , by capturing the degrees of freedom of open strings in an abelian background gauge field .",
    "the born - infeld parameter @xmath4 is then related to the inverse tension of fundamental strings , by @xmath5 .",
    "einstein s general relativity is the fundamental building block for the gravity sector of superstring or m - theory which consistently unify gravity and the standard model of elementary particle physics . in supersymmetrized form",
    ", general relativity appears as the low energy effective theory ( in ten or eleven dimensions ) . that it is plagued , like maxwell electrodynamics , by singularities in the gravitational field of point masses , thus can be considered a major problem",
    "of course , string / m - theory predict corrections to general relativity at higher orders in the curvature ( corresponding to higher orders in @xmath6 ) , but no way has been found yet to resum these corrections , as in the born - infeld case , so to incorporate arbitrary high powers of the curvature and to solve the problems inherent in einstein gravity .    inspired by born - infeld electrodynamics ,",
    "several attempts have been made in the construction of gravity analogues .",
    "deser and gibbons @xcite formulate three obvious criteria that such a theory should satisfy .",
    "1 .   freedom of ghosts .",
    "2 .   regularization of singularities .",
    "3 .   supersymmetrizability .",
    "some comments on these points are in order .",
    "_ ad 1_. responsible for the propagation of ghosts , in a perturbative expansion around the minkowski vacuum spacetime , are the terms in the action which are quadratic in the curvature .",
    "the only exemption from this rule is the quadratic gauss - bonnet combination @xmath7 which is a total derivative in four dimensions and for which , in higher dimensions , the quadratic terms in the perturbative expansion still cancel up to total derivatives @xcite .    _",
    "ad 2_. in general , not all types of singularities can be removed , and not all of them should be removed , as pointed out by horowitz and myers @xcite .",
    "they argue that certain gravitational plane waves are solutions to any general theory whose lagrangian is a function of the metric , the curvature and its covariant derivatives .",
    "this is due to the fact that all curvature scalars of these spacetimes vanish .",
    "but the two polarizations of a plane wave can diverge , which leads to unbounded tidal forces .",
    "hence , all extensions of general relativity will have solutions with null singularities .",
    "furthermore , negative energy solutions of general relativity , e.g. , the schwarzschild solution with negative mass parameter , should not be regularized , since this would imply an instability of the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the singularities of negative energy solutions serve as a useful criterion of unphysicality .    _",
    "ad 3_. supersymmetrizability is a very stringent requirement and is presumably natural if the gravity theory were implied by higher - dimensional string / m - theory .",
    "it is illuminating to take a closer look at previous attempts to construct gravities in born - infeld style .",
    "the discussion of @xcite , for instance , considers a lagrangian of the form @xmath8 where the tensor @xmath9 contains terms of second or higher order in the curvature and the @xmath10 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the simplest of these models has @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is , of course , not ghost - free because terms from @xmath9 are needed to balance those arising in second order of the curvature expansion from @xmath13 .",
    "this model does not improve general relativity in the sense that it has the standard schwarzschild ( -de sitter ) solution .",
    "note that this can be explained intuitively .",
    "the schwarzschild solution is ricci flat , and hence , its singularity can be recognized only from the second order curvature invariant @xmath14 , but not from @xmath15 and @xmath16 . but this invariant does not occur in the curvature expansion of the above model , so that it may be unbounded in solutions . a theory that places an upper bound on @xmath14",
    "is introduced in a rather _ ad hoc _ way in @xcite , essentially by adding @xmath17 to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "the author of this paper finds non - singular black hole solutions , which underlines the importance of using the full riemann tensor in order to regularize gravitational singularities .",
    "supersymmetric constructions , which will not be further discussed here , can be found in @xcite .",
    "making use of these insights , in this article , a method is presented to construct a large , and novel , class of gravity theories in born - infeld style .",
    "section [ sec . basic model ] introduces the basic model and discusses some of its properties .",
    "in particular , it is found that the positive mass schwarzschild singularity may be removed , whereas the negative energy solution remains singular as is necessary for a stable minkowski vacuum .",

    "cancel ghosts ] considers generalizations of the basic model that allow for the cancellation of ghosts .",

    "both requirements can be satisfied by using the symmetries of the riemann tensor calculated from the metric connection .",

    "the equality holds for an exponent @xmath26 .",
    "note , however , that one might start out from the action on the right hand side which allows for different @xmath27 .",
    "the only restriction appears to be a fractional @xmath27 because a possible regularization of singularities is only expected from the appearance of all curvature orders in the action . a curvature expansion of the lagrangian is equivalent to an expansion around @xmath28 and , being a special case of equation ( [ eq .",
    "curv exp ] ) with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , gives @xmath31 for the lowest orders .",

    "gbcomb ] ) in the introduction .",
    "the cancellation of the ghosts will be discussed in the following section [ sec . cancel ghosts ] .    for the moment , it is useful to push on and to investigate some properties of this basic model which are carried over , at least qualitatively , to the more complicated models .",

    "the equation of motion is satisfied by @xmath74 .",
    "the second derivative at this point , however , tends to zero with an infinite positive slope and an infinite negative curvature .",
    "so the solution for @xmath3 becomes singular at @xmath72 . in principle",
    ", the numerical integration of the equation of motion could be carried on to smaller values @xmath75 , but this would necessitate an exact knowledge of the type of singularity involved .",
    "lacking such knowledge about the singularity of the solution at @xmath76 , it is still interesting to ask which solutions on the inner domain might match to the outer one .",
    "a way to integrate further inwards is to simply assume a pole in the third derivative of @xmath3 and to supply new initial conditions at some value of @xmath50 slightly smaller than @xmath72 .",

    "note that all possible inner solutions regularize the metric function @xmath79 at @xmath51 .",
    "the curvature singularities , however , are only regularized by the inner solution with vanishing @xmath48 . in this case",
    ", one finds @xmath80 and @xmath81 throughout the inner domain .",
    "the completely regularized solution is very interesting for the following reason .",
    "vanishing @xmath82 corresponds to a schwarzschild function @xmath83 on the inner domain and thus gives the spherical solution a de sitter core .",
    "this scenario is reminiscent of the ` gravastar ' picture , see @xcite and compare @xcite .",
    "based on the assumption of the incompatibility of the standard schwarzschild spacetime with quantum mechanics , these authors develop a setup in which this spacetime is replaced , in the interior , by a segment of de sitter space , separated by a shell , filled with a ` quantum fluid ' , from the exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "these models are hoped to resolve among other problems the black hole information paradox .",
    "intriguingly , the gravity model proposed here enforces the existence of a special radius at which a de sitter core may be merged to an approximately schwarzschild outer domain , even without relying on the _ ad hoc _ introduction of any quantum fluid . admittedly , the physical interpretation of the positive energy solution near the special point @xmath72 has to be worked out in more detail .    in the case of the negative energy analogue of the schwarzschild solution ,",
    "the mass parameter @xmath67 is negative , which makes the series coefficient @xmath66 positive ( keeping @xmath84 ) .",
    "now each term of the power series solution diverges for small radii @xmath85 , so the whole series does , which has also been confirmed numerically .",
    "hence , the singularity of the negative energy solution does not get regularized and marks this solution as unphysical .",
    "this is a remarkable example of how a gravity theory improves the singularity situation by getting rid of the annoying ones while keeping those which are important for a stable minkowski vacuum .",
    "some other points are interesting .",
    "the positive energy solutions of figure [ fig .",
    "alimit ] which just regularize the metric function do only have a single horizon .",
    "the solution regularizing also the curvature singularities has two horizons .",
    "this confirms and exemplifies an argument of @xcite , which says that the number of horizons in a solution of higher derivative gravity that regularizes the curvature singularities at @xmath51 has to be even .",
    "figure [ fig .",
    "alimit ] has been plotted for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , i.e. , for the ratio @xmath88 .",
    "the solutions undergo a qualitative change for smaller masses . to see this , figure [ fig .",
    "baremass ] shows the numerical solutions for the same @xmath89 but for different ratios @xmath90 .    for masses that are smaller than @xmath4 , the horizons disappear and the schwarzschild function stays positive for all values of @xmath50 .",
    "this phenomenon has been christened a ` bare mass ' in @xcite .",
    "the existence of such small bare masses , however , is unclear .",
    "as will be seen below , in string theory , the parameter @xmath4 would naturally be of the order of magnitude of @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , it is a nice feature of a gravity theory that extremely small , but also extremely localized , energy fluctuations do only produce a small disturbance of minkowski spacetime without a horizon .",
    "ghost freedom is a necessary requirement for any theory of gravity to be of possible relevance in a fundamental unified quantum theory . to achieve ghost freedom in gravity _  la _ born - infeld , one has to go beyond the basic model presented in the preceding section .",
    "while keeping the nice determinantal form of the action , it is not sufficient to consider only terms of first order in the curvature inside the determinant ; second order terms have to be included as well .",
    "the most general action , obeying the construction principle of antisymmetrized indices used above , is of the form @xmath91\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 contain all possible first and second order terms , respectively .",
    "hence , a curvature expansion of the action directly corresponds to an expansion in orders of the parameter @xmath4 . in general ,",
    "@xmath94    where fourteen new parameters occur which are denoted by greek characters .",
    "the tensors @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined in the appendix , and some of their properties are given . here , it suffices to say that @xmath95 essentially contains the ricci tensor , and the @xmath96 present different contractions of two riemann tensors .    substituting the above expressions for @xmath97 and @xmath98 into the curvature expansion formula ( [ eq .",
    "curv exp ] ) , one finds the following linear and quadratic terms , @xmath99 where some functions @xmath100 of the parameters in the model appear .",
    "ghost freedom is implied by the gauss - bonnet combination ( [ eq .",
    "gbcomb ] ) of the quadratic curvature terms which in turn follows from the two equations @xmath101 .",
    "more specifically ,    @xmath102    this implies that there is a huge class of ghost - free models ; this class is a thirteen - parameter family because the fourteen new parameters are only constrained by the following two equations ,    [ eq .",
    "gaussbonnet ] @xmath103    and the expansion parameter @xmath4 is free .",
    "unfortunately , the equations of motion for these models , even in the simple case of a spherically symmetric spacetime , are extremely involved .",
    "it is expected that , at least in some cases , the nice features , and essentially the regularization property , of the basic model of the preceding section are kept .",
    "this has been checked , for instance , for the specific parameter values @xmath104 ,",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 ( with all remaining parameters vanishing ) .",
    "all properties were found to be qualitatively similar .",
    "clearly , if the gravity theories in born - infeld form were expected to play an important role in any fundamental theory , one would need further physical principles to narrow down the wide range of possible choices .",
    "one such , very constraining , principle might be the requirement of supersymmetrizability of the gravitational action .",
    "another might be the idea that such an action could be derived as an effective action from string theory , as it has been possible in the case of born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "two different methods have been used to deduce the born - infeld action from string theory .",
    "one uses the polyakov path integral @xcite , in which the open string degrees of freedom are integrated out , in order to derive the effective action for the appropriate background fields .",
    "the other method requires conformal invariance on the string worldsheet and constructs the corresponding beta functions @xcite .",
    "the conditions that they vanish can be obtained as equations of motion from the effective action .",
    "the first approach is not available in the gravitational case .",
    "the polyakov path integral is the connected generating functional and contains the effect of massless poles , and so it should not have a meaningful low energy expansion @xcite .",
    "the approach via the gravitational beta functions is a valid one .",
    "this has been shown , for example , in @xcite for general string gravity backgrounds , including the antisymmetric tensor field and the dilaton .",
    "but so far , this method has not been as successful as in the born - infeld case .",
    "the effective gravity action derived from string theory is only known for some low orders in the curvature .",
    "nevertheless , the known first few orders of effective gravity deduced from string theory can be used to narrow down the choice of parameters for the ghost - free models of the preceding section .",
    "this is done under the working hypothesis that such an action might indeed be of importance in a fundamental theory .",
    "a ghost - free model has to be taken because string induced gravity is ghost - free @xcite .",
    "the effective action employed here contains curvature terms up to the third order @xcite and reads @xmath107   &   & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation introduced in the appendix has been used . for illustrational purposes , and",
    "because the born - infeld style gravities at present are purely bosonic theories , the action for a bosonic @xmath108-model is used in this section . in the supersymmetric case ,",
    "the situation presents itself in a different light .",
    "then the @xmath108-models do not lead to third order curvature corrections of the einstein action @xcite .",
    "terms of fourth order , however , are important @xcite and have been paid a lot of attention .",
    "this is also due to the fact that they are the first non - trivial , supersymmetrizable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) corrections arising from string theories which are compactified to four dimensions .",
    "the second order terms appear in the gauss - bonnet combination , while the third order ones are not supersymmetrizable .",
    "note that the above action does seem to contain ghosts .",
    "this is because string scattering amplitudes , and beta functions , are calculated for external gravitons that are on einstein shell , i.e. , that satisfy the ( linearized ) vacuum einstein equations @xmath109 .",
    "this means that , in second order of the curvature , the terms @xmath15 and @xmath16 simply can be added with the appropriate factors to achieve the gauss - bonnet combination @xcite ( the same can be effected by means of appropriate field redefinitions @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , it means that a string - induced effective gravity action will never contain any terms that involve at least twice the ricci tensor or ricci scalar . upon variation , one of them will always remain so that these terms vanish on shell , compare @xcite .",
    "so the first allowed simplification in the born - infeld gravity models , which does not interfere with their consistency with string theory , is to set @xmath110 ; compare equation ( [ eq . mn ] ) .",
    "in addition to the two equations ( [ eq .",
    "gaussbonnet ] ) that enforce gauss - bonnet on the quadratic level , there are further equations that constrain the remaining parameters .",
    "the first comes from comparing the first two orders of the curvature , see ( [ eq .",

    "it is clear that the expansion parameter @xmath4 is proportional to the inverse string tension , @xmath115 .",
    "this , again , is very reminiscent of born - infeld electrodynamics , where the action takes into account all orders in @xmath6 and , hence , all orders of the field strength tensor , which is responsible for the regularization of the electric field of point charges .",

    ", string theory might resolve the singularity problems of general relativity .",
    "the theories presented here are the first examples of gravity theories doing just that . whether or not one of them is indeed derivable from string / m - theory",
    "can not be answered at present .",
    "a simple recipe has been presented for constructing gravity theories with an action in determinantal form , very similar to the action of born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "the construction is based on the observation that the schwarzschild singularity can only be recognized from the second order curvature invariant @xmath14 , but not from those invariants constructed from the ricci tensor .",
    "hence , a gravity theory that expects to cure singularities , by placing upper bounds on @xmath14 , or otherwise , should include the full riemann tensor .",
    "the actual formulation of the new class of theories presented in this article utilizes the symmetries of the riemann tensor , considering only tensors with pairs of antisymmetrized indices .    for the simplest version of born - infeld style gravity , the analogue of the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution has been analyzed .",
    "a different behaviour has been found in different mass regimes . in all cases",
    "the schwarzschild singularity , at least for the positive energy solution , may be removed ( a detailed discussion is found in section [ sec . sing ] ) . for large masses , compared to some expansion parameter , the horizon remains ; small masses , on the other hand , become ` bare masses ' without a horizon .",
    "the negative energy schwarzschild solution remains singular and is thus distinguished to be unphysical , which is necessary in order to have a stable minkowski vacuum configuration .",
    "the bare masses are a nice feature in the sense that extremely small yet localized energy fluctuations would only produce small spacetime distortions , without generating horizons and thereby changing the topology .",
    "these characteristics make the new born - infeld style gravities nice examples of theories , in which the annoying singularities are removed , whereas the important ones remain .",
    "it has been shown that extended models can be defined in which the ghosts , in a perturbative expansion around flat minkowski spacetime , cancel .",
    "the improved behaviour of these theories with respect to general relativity is kept , at least for some models .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations , even for the simple spherically symmetric spacetime , are quite involved , so that it remains unclear whether all extended , ghost - free models have improved singularity properties .",
    "ghost - freedom is essential , if the born - infeld gravities were expected to be derivable from an underlying , unified theory such as string or m - theory .",

    "it might be of interest to pursue extensions of the born - infeld style gravities which try to incorporate these fields .",
    "the value of the string theory against gravity comparison is not so much a proof , showing exactly what kind of gravity is induced by string theory , but much more the exhibition of the following interesting and important mechanism .    a way has been suggested in which string theory , by inclusion of all orders of @xmath6 corrections , corresponding to all orders of the curvature in the string - induced gravity action , might actually regularize gravitational singularities .",
    "the final gravity theory induced from string or m - theory thus is expected to have at least all the good features of the gravities _  la _ born - infeld , which are nice examples realizing this idea .",
    "furthermore , it would probably be supersymmetrizable , and it would be interesting to investigate whether any of the models here has this property .",
    "this appendix contains some calculations and definitions needed in the main text , especially in section [ sec . cancel ghosts ] , which considers the ghost - free models of born - infeld gravity , and in section [ sec",

    "they contain the ricci tensor at the first order level ( which can not be obtained by tracing @xmath117 ) and some special combinations of two riemann tensors in second order of the curvature :    @xmath118    these tensors and their products , including also the riemann tensor @xmath117 , obey the following important trace relations , in which the notation @xmath119 is used ,    [ eq . trace1 ] @xmath120    and    @xmath121    as well as    @xmath122    and    [ eq .",

    "the first misprint was pointed out by deser _",
    "_ @xcite ; subsequent computations are unaffected .",
    "another important point has been raised by the authors of @xcite . given any physical theory in terms of its action , it is generally not the case that solutions to the equations of motion of an effective theory obtained by a truncation of the original action ( by means of a specific ansatz for the relevant fields ) are also solutions to the equations of motion of the original theory . in other words , truncations in this sense and variation generally do not commute .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown @xcite that the effective action ( 11 ) for a static spherically symmetric spacetime ansatz with two undetermined functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 of the radial coordinate may be considered .    in the paper",
    ", a further truncation of the static spherically symmetric ansatz , setting @xmath139 , has been used in deriving the effective action ( 13 ) and the equation of motion ( 14 ) .",
    "this truncation is not related to any symmetry ; thus , equation ( 14 ) is necessary , but not sufficient : any solution of the equations for @xmath137 and @xmath138 from ( 11 ) which satisfies @xmath139 solves ( 14 ) , but the converse is not generally true .",
    "therefore , the validity of any solution of ( 14 ) has to be checked by substituting it into at least one of the equations for @xmath137 or @xmath138 from ( 11 ) .",
    "the procedure of using the simpler equation ( 14 ) should be considered merely a means of suggesting solutions for the original equations .",
    "the paper gives @xmath140 and @xmath141 for arbitrary constants @xmath142 as solutions of ( 14 ) .",
    "unfortunately , a check of the validity of these solutions in the equations derived from ( 11 ) was omitted , and we will do this check now .",
    "we find that @xmath143 is invalid .",
    "however , @xmath144 gives valid solutions , provided either @xmath145 or @xmath146 , where the constant @xmath147 is determined as a real solution of the equation @xmath148 ( which implies the equations from ( 11 ) with @xmath139 ) . for the linear expression @xmath141 , a denominator vanishes in the equations derived from both actions ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) , so that this expression can not be a stationary solution .",
    "it has not been properly checked yet whether the previously given numerical solutions of ( 14 ) are correct .",
    "although a substitution of the solution into the equations from ( 11 ) produces ` small ' errors , and although the error associated with the equation of motion for @xmath137 oscillates around zero , such a check is not conclusive in many examples of differential equations .",
    "a proper check would involve the integration of both equations for @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
