    "this paper concerns with finite element approximations of variational problems whose solutions ( or minimizers ) exhibit the so - called _ lavrentiev gap phenomenon _ - a defect from the singularities of the solutions .",
    "such problems are often encountered in materials sciences , nonlinear elasticity , and image processing ( cf . @xcite and",
    "the references therein ) .",
    "these variational problems can be abstractly stated as follows : @xmath5 where the energy functional @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is an open and bounded domain , @xmath9 , called the density function of @xmath10 , is assumed to be a continuous function , the space @xmath11 is known as the admissible set , @xmath12 is some given function .",
    "let @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath14 is bounded , then @xmath15 and consequently there holds @xmath16 problem is said to exhibit _ the lavrentiev gap phenomenon _ whenever @xmath17 in other words , when the strict inequality holds in .",
    "the gap between the minimum values on both sides of suggests that the the minimizer of the left - hand side must have some singularity which causes the gap .",
    "such a singularity often corresponds to a defect in a material or an edge in an image .",
    "it has been known in the literature @xcite that the gap phenomenon could happen not only for nonconvex energy functionals but also for strictly convex and coercive energy functionals . as a result",
    ", it is a very complicated phenomenon to characterize and to analyze as well as to approximate ( see below for details ) , because the gap phenomenon can be triggered by quite different mechanisms and the definition of _ the lavrentiev gap phenomenon _ is a very broad concept which covers many different types of singularities . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "so far there is no known general sufficient conditions which guarantee the existence of the gap phenomenon .",
    "the simplest and best known example of the gap phenomenon is mani s 1-d problem @xcite , where one minimizes the functional @xmath18\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] over all functions @xmath19 satisfying @xmath20 and @xmath21 . by inspection",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath22 minimizes with a minimum value zero .",
    "however , it can be shown that the minimum over space @xmath23 ( i.e. , the space of all lipschitz functions ) is strictly larger than zero . as a result",
    ", mani s problem does exhibits _ the lavrentiev gap phenomenon_. notice that @xmath24 which blows up rapidly as @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , a more striking property , which was proved by ball and knowles ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , is that if @xmath26 is a sequence of functions in @xmath27 for @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that @xmath31 a.e . as @xmath32 , then @xmath33 as @xmath32 . since the finite element space @xmath34 ( see section [ section2 ] for its definition ) is a subspace of @xmath1 , the above properties of the functional @xmath10 imply that the standard finite element approximations to mani s problem must fail to approximate both the minimizer and the minimum value of the functional .",
    "such a conclusion was indeed verified numerically in @xcite , also see figure [ fig2:1 ] for another numerical verification .",
    "this negative result immediately leads to the following two conclusions : first , variational problems which exhibit the gap phenomenon are difficult and delicate to approximate numerically ; second , nonstandard numerical methods must be designed for such problems in order to correctly approximate both the minimizers and the minimum values .",
    "the failure of the standard finite element method suggests that in order to ensure the convergence of any numerical method which uses @xmath34 as the approximation space , one needs to construct a discrete energy functional @xmath35 which necessarily does not coincide with @xmath10 on the finite element space @xmath34 .",
    "as expected , there have been a few successful attempts to design convergent numerical methods for variational problems with the gap phenomenon .",
    "below we only focus on discussing the methods which use conforming finite element methods to approximate variational problems with the mani - type gap phenomenon , by which we mean that the minimizers of the variational problems blow up in the @xmath1-norm .",
    "but it is important to note that some gap phenomenon problems have been solved with the use of penalty and nonconforming finite element methods @xcite .",
    "the first numerical method was proposed by ball and knowles in @xcite . to handle the difficulty caused by the rapid blow - up in @xmath1-norm of the minimizer @xmath36",
    ", they proposed to approximate @xmath36 and its derivative @xmath37 simultaneously , an idea which is often seen in mixed finite element methods .",
    "specifically , the authors proposed to minimize the discrete energy functional @xmath38 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the constraint @xmath39 for some super - linear function @xmath40 over all functions @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote respectively the discontinuous piecewise constant space and the continuous piecewise affine finite element space associated with a mesh @xmath44 of @xmath14 .",
    "where @xmath45 is a sequence such that @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "notice that @xmath48 essentially has the same form as the original functional @xmath10 after setting @xmath49 .",
    "while this method works and is well - posed on the discrete level , the decoupling of @xmath50 and @xmath51 adds an additional layer of unknowns which increases the complexity of the discrete minimization problem . moreover , its generalization to higher dimensions is not straightforward .",
    "the other major numerical developments were carried out by z. li _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "their work has brought two similar methods : an element removal method and a truncation method .",
    "here we only detail the truncation method and briefly mention the element removal method because the latter is similar to the former and the truncation method is more closely related to our method to be introduced in this paper",
    ". let @xmath52 and @xmath53 . define the discrete energy functional @xmath54 where @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",
    "the truncation substitutes the contribution of @xmath56 by another constant if @xmath50 behaves  poorly \" on @xmath57 .",
    "the element removal method simply discards ( i.e. , sets @xmath58 on ) those  bad \" elements . both methods are robust and calculate the minimum value of @xmath10 over @xmath59 ( assuming the minimizer @xmath36 uniquely exists ) .",
    "however , the determination of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( or  bad \" elements ) requires a litany of _ a priori _ assumptions , some of which depend on the sought - after exact minimizer @xmath36 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to introduce an effective and robust numerical method which slightly alters the standard finite element method by a novel and simple cut - off procedure .",
    "our approach is motivated by the rationale that the standard finite element method fails to work because the magnitude of the gradient @xmath62 becomes too large ( independent of the magnitude of @xmath63 , where @xmath63 stands for the standard finite element solution ) near the singularity points .",
    "so the idea of our cut - off procedure is simply to limit the growth of @xmath64 to @xmath65 order in the whole domain @xmath14 , the resulting discrete energy functional is then given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the cut - off function ( see section [ section3 ] for its definition ) .",
    "it is important to note that , unlike the truncation method of @xcite , the choice of the crucial parameter @xmath68 does not depend on any _ a priori _ knowledge about the exact minimizer @xmath36 , instead , it only depends on the structure of the energy density function @xmath69 and the space @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , we shall provide a sufficient condition , which is easy to use , for determining an upper bound for @xmath68 to ensure the convergence .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we introduce the notation , preliminary results such as finite element meshes and spaces . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we state the variational problems we aim to solve and the assumptions under which we develop our numerical method .",
    "we then define our finite element method with a help of the above cut - off procedure .",
    "we also present the alluded sufficient condition for determining an upper bound for @xmath68 and demonstrate its utility using mani s problem . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we provide some extensive numerical experiment results for two specific application problems to gauge the performance of the proposed enhanced finite element method .",
    "finally , the paper is ended with some concluding remarks in section [ section5 ] .",
    "standard function and space notation will be adopted throughout this paper .",
    "for example , for an open and bounded domain @xmath71 with boundary @xmath72 , let @xmath73 for @xmath74 denotes the sobolev space consisting of functions whose up to first order weak derivatives are @xmath75-integrable over @xmath14 and @xmath76 denotes the standard norm on @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath59 have been introduced in section [ section1 ] , we also define the space @xmath77 for any @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath10 be the same as in and the variational problem to be considered in the rest of this paper is given by .",
    "suppose that problem has a unique solution @xmath36 which exhibits _ the lavrentiev gap phenomenon _ as defined in section [ section1 ] , that is , we assume there holds inequality @xmath79 so our primary goal is to construct an effective and robust finite element method to approximate @xmath36 .",
    "to this end , let @xmath44 be a quasi - uniform triangular ( when @xmath80 ) or tetrahedral ( when @xmath81 ) mesh of @xmath14 with mesh parameter @xmath82 .",
    "for a positive integer @xmath83 , we define the finite element space @xmath34 on @xmath44 by @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the set of all polynomials whose degrees do not exceed @xmath83 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath86 for all @xmath82 , then an obvious attempt to formulate a numerical method for variational problem is the following standard finite element method which seeks @xmath87 such that @xmath88 unfortunately , this finite element method fails to give a convergent method because the method can not give the true minimum value if holds and will not converge to the correct minimizer as the numerical test shows in figure [ fig2:1 ] .     and the dashed lines are the finite element minimizers @xmath63 for @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "all minimizations were implemented by using the matlab minimization routine ` fminunc ` with initial function @xmath91 .",
    ", width=307,height=240 ]    to see the deeper reason , we note that for any @xmath92 with @xmath93 , the existence of a sequence of functions @xmath94 with @xmath95 in @xmath70 such that @xmath96 is a key step to show convergence of the discrete minimizers .",
    "it is clear that implies that @xmath97 for any @xmath98 with @xmath99 in @xmath70 , which contradicts with for the minimizer @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , it was proved by c. ortner in @xcite that for a class of convex energies the convergence ( to the exact solution ) of the standard finite element method is equivalent to not holding ( i.e. , the gap phenomenon does not occur ) .",
    "from the analysis given in the previous section we conclude that in order to construct a convergent numerical method which uses @xmath34 as an approximation space , we must design a discrete energy functional @xmath35 which should not coincide with @xmath10 on the finite element space @xmath34 . in this section",
    "we shall construct a discrete energy functional @xmath35 which meets this criterion and provides a convergent ( nonstandard ) finite element method for problem .    before introducing our method ,",
    "let us give a heuristic discussion about why the gap phenomenon is appearing and how the existing methods assuage its effect .",
    "consider mani s problem .",
    "for any @xmath100 ( or in @xmath101 ) sufficiently approximating @xmath22 , the quantity @xmath102 will be small but always nonzero .",
    "however , at the same time @xmath103 will be very large near the origin .",
    "if @xmath103 is raised to a high enough power - six in this case - then the error of @xmath102 will be magnified to be so large that the quantity @xmath104\\ ] ] will not vanish as @xmath47 .",
    "for this reason , all of the existing methods were designed to dampen the effect of the derivative in the integral .",
    "the method of ball and knowles @xcite weakly enforces @xmath105 which allows the method to soften the effect of @xmath51 , where @xmath51 has a singularity , and achieves convergence .",
    "the methods of li _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite leave the function @xmath69 unchanged , but remove or replace the functional value on the elements where something has gone wrong .    with this in mind",
    "we now introduce a discrete energy functional which is much simpler and has a majority of the characteristics of the methods in @xcite .",
    "our approach is motivated by the belief that the standard finite element method fails to work because the magnitude of the gradient @xmath62 becomes too large ( independent of the magnitude of @xmath63 , where @xmath63 denotes the solution to ) near the singularity points .",
    "so our idea is simply to use a cut - off procedure to limit the growth of @xmath64 to @xmath65 on the whole domain @xmath14 in our discrete energy functional @xmath35 . to this end , let @xmath106 , define the cut - off function @xmath107 in the @xmath108th component by @xmath109_i = \\begin{cases }                        s_i & \\text { if } |s_i| \\leq h^{-{\\alpha } } \\\\",
    "\\mbox{sign}(s_i ) h^{-{\\alpha } } & \\text { if } |s_i| > h^{-{\\alpha } }                         \\end{cases } , \\qquad i=1,2,\\ldots n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is clear that this function merely cuts the value of @xmath110 to a constant @xmath111 if @xmath112 is too large .",
    "then our discrete functional is simply defined as @xmath113,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and our enhanced finite element method is defined by seeking @xmath87 such that @xmath114    since our discrete energy functional @xmath115 curbs the gap phenomenon by capping the derivative of its input on a scale of @xmath65 , spiritually it is similar to the truncation method of li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but unlike the truncation method it keeps the dynamics of @xmath69 with respect to @xmath116 and @xmath117 much like ball and knowles approach in @xcite . implementing",
    "the cut - off procedure is very simple and can be done by adding a few lines of code .",
    "moreover , unlike the truncation method , our enhanced finite element method does not require _ a priori _ knowledge about the exact minimizer @xmath36 of .",
    "further adding to the simplicity is the existence of only one parameter @xmath4 in the method . here",
    "@xmath4 controls the rate at which the cut - off grows and is the key for the convergence of the method . in general , @xmath4 needs to be chosen in order to obtain equation for all @xmath92 where @xmath118 is the finite element interpolant of @xmath116 . indeed , is the only restriction we impose upon @xmath4 .",
    "a permissible range for @xmath4 , which guarantees convergence , depends on the structure of the density function @xmath69 , so it is problem - dependent .",
    "below we use mani s problem to demonstrate the process .",
    "we now derive an upper bound for @xmath68 such that holds for @xmath92 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath92 , notice that @xmath93 , let @xmath118 denote the finite element interpolant of @xmath116 .",

    "the proof of the assertion goes as follows . by hlder",

    "we regard this property as one crucial advantage of our method .",
    "in this section we present some numerical experiment results for two variational problems which are known to exhibit the gap phenomenon .",
    "the first problem is mani s 1-d problem which has been seen in the previous sections ; the second problem , which was proposed by foss in @xcite , is a 2-d variational problem from nonlinear elasticity . for each of the two test problems we solve it by using our enhanced finite element method with linear element ( i.e. , @xmath136 ) , and we solve the minimization problem by using the matlab minimization function ` fminunc ` .",
    "we first demonstrate the convergence of the numerical method , we then numerically evaluate the effect and sharpness of the parameter @xmath4 , and compare with the standard finite element method ( which is known to be divergent ) .",

    "such a project has already been undertaken using the @xmath161-convergence approach and will be reported later in @xcite .",
