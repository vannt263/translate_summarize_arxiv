    "<S> but the difference is that the nonperturbative contributions seem to play opposite roles in these two groups of decays.(ii ) the pure annihilation type decays @xmath3 are good channels to test whether an approach can be used to calculate correctly the strength of the penguin - annihilation amplitudes . </S>",
