    "many exact results have been obtained since the discovery by seiberg and witten @xcite of the exact solution of the low energy @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath4 gauge theory in four dimensions .",
    "the low energy @xmath0 susy yang - mills theories contain @xmath7 abelian @xmath0 vector supermultiplets , which can be decomposed into @xmath8 @xmath9 chiral multiplets @xmath10 plus @xmath8 @xmath9 vector multiplets @xmath11 . according to @xcite the scalar component @xmath12 of the @xmath10 (",
    "namely , its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) ) is the local coordinate on the quantum moduli space of the effective action of the theory .",
    "it is given by the integrals of meromorphic differentials @xmath13 over the basic cycles @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 , on a hyper - elliptic curve @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , their derivatives with respect to the symmetric vevs @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are equal to @xcite : ~a_ki = _ _ i + a_di",
    "s_k ~b_ki = _ _ i [ ab ] we will be mainly interested in the coupling matrix @xmath20 , which is the period matrix on @xmath21 . in the matrix form",
    ", it can be presented as @xcite : = * a*^-1*b * [ tau ] in some particular cases the integration in ( [ ab ] ) may be performed explicitly .",
    "it has been done for the @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath22 groups @xcite . for higher @xmath23 , it is not so immediate , and , therefore , there were a series of calculations taking into account only the one - instanton corrections @xcite . for @xmath24 ,",
    "integration in ( [ ab ] ) becomes much more complicated , and picard - fuchs equations are not known for arbitrary @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "some theories have the same integrals - this allows us to derive relations between couplings ( see section @xmath26 ) and , in some particular cases , even to obtain exact results .",
    "the first step in this direction was done in @xcite , where some exact beta functions for the @xmath4 and @xmath22 cases were calculated .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss the coupling constants for the theories with @xmath23 colors and @xmath25 ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) massless flavours .",
    "we calculate them for the second order in the instanton expansion by the direct evaluation of integrals ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "all the bare masses @xmath29 of the matter hypermultiplets are put zero ( till the appendix ) .",
    "as later we deal with instanton contributions to the prepotential , it is relevant to remind the perturbative expansion of the prepotential which is saturated in one loop due to the supersymmetry : = i _",
    "i < j(a_i - a_j)^2 [ pprep ]    in section 3 we consider the scale invariant @xmath2 theory .",
    "it has the classical period matrix @xmath30 proportional to the matrix @xmath31 : @xmath32 ( in the basis @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ) . by comparing the spectral curves for this theory and for the @xmath28 one , we demonstrate that spectral curve for uv finite @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) theory can not be hyperelliptic ( double covering of @xmath37 ) .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the @xmath4 theory .",
    "we present the strong evidence for the method proposed by j. a. minahan and d. nemeschansky which helps one to obtain some useful relations between the @xmath27 and @xmath38 theories .    in appendix",
    "we present some nonperturbative @xmath3-functions of the @xmath4 gauge theory with non - zero masses of the matter hypermultiplets .",
    "now we are going to discuss some akin @xmath0 susy yang - mills theories which have the similar spectral curves each depending on one dimensionless parameter .",
    "namely , we note that the curves for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 theories have the same forms in the symmetric point on the moduli space ( compare ( [ 0nf ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) )",
    ". the period matrix @xmath20 must be the same for the both theories , turning into each other by an appropriate replace of the parameters . before going further ,",
    "let us stress that the curves are regarded akin if they are related by @xmath39 transformation ( this is the common property of the two - dimensional manifolds ) or by rescaling @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( because we restrict ourselves to the only parameter and @xmath20 is dimensionless too ) .",
    "for instance , for general @xmath36 with all the order parameters @xmath42 being zero but @xmath43 , the @xmath27 and @xmath28 curves take the forms @xcite :    * @xmath27 y^2=(x^n_c - u^(0))^2-^(0)2n_c y^2=x^2n_c-2f^(0)x^n_c+1 [ 0nf ] * @xmath28 y^2=(x^n_c - u^(n_c)+)^2-^(n_c)n_cx^n_c y^2=x^2n_c-2f^(n_c)x^n_c+1 [ nc ]    where    * @xmath27 f^(0)= ^(0)2n_c = u^(0)2(1-f^(0)-2 ) [ 0fun ] * @xmath28 f^(n_c)= ^(n_c)n_c=4u^(n_c ) [ ncfun ]    as a consequence , their couplings are ( here we denote @xmath44 ) : t_ij^(n_c)(v^(n_c))=t_ij^(0 ) ( ) ; + t_ij^(0)(v^(0))=t_ij^(n_c ) ( ( 1 - - ) ) , n_c>2 [ vev ]    the same procedure may be performed for other gauge groups .",
    "one does not need to know integrals ( [ ab ] ) explicitly .",
    "instead , it is sufficient to compare the curves , i. e. to obtain relations between the quantities which may be @xmath30 , @xmath3 , @xmath45 or their expansions in series at small @xmath46 .",
    "let us evaluate ( [ ab ] ) to find period matrix , namely , first instanton terms .",
    "we will focus on the @xmath27 theory ( as it has been shown earlier @xmath28 case is completly analogous ) : a_kl=2_x_-,l^x_+,l= - ^l(1-k)z_-^-mf_2,1 ( , m;1;1- ) [ a ] + b_kl=2_x_-,1^x_-,l= ( ^l(1-k)-^(1-k ) ) f_2,1(,1-m;3 2-m;z_- z_+ ) [ b ]    where we chose the cycles as shown on fig.1 ( @xmath47 assumed ) so that : x_,l=^l x _ ; =( ) ; m= + x_=(u ^n_c)^1 n_c= z_^1 n_c ; [ roots ] + = -1 ; in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath48 ) , ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) take the forms : a_kl=- ^l(1-k)z_-^-m(1-m 2 + 3 16m(m+1)^2 + ( 1 8 - 3 32 m - 1 6m^2)m^3 + ) [ acl ] + @xmath49 - 5 96m(m+1)(m+2)^3 ) + 2 + m^2 - 5 m - 3 16 ^2 + ( 5 48 + 1 32m(8 + 2m - m^2))^3 + ) [ bcl ] where @xmath50 is the euler constant , and @xmath51 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function .",
    "it is useful to note that the dependence of @xmath52 and @xmath53 on @xmath54 and @xmath55 is : a_kl = a(k ) e_kl e_kl=^l(1-k ) [ aa ] + b_kl = b(k)(^l(1-k)-^(1-k))=b(k)(e_kl+ _ le_kl ) [ ab ] substituting it into ( [ tau ] ) , one gets the matrix of coupling constants for the @xmath27 theory : t_ij=_kb(k ) a(k)(e^-1)_ik(e_kj+ _ je_kj ) = [ tt ] @xmath56    it is easy to show that @xmath30 is proportional to @xmath57 , if and only if all the exact @xmath58 are the same functions for any @xmath59 . imposing the constraint @xmath60 on @xmath30",
    ", one immediately gets from ( [ tt ] ) : @xmath61 which , after simple transformations , turns into : a^-1(k)b(k)=const [ test ] this equation must be satisfied in all orders in @xmath13 . obviously , it is not true and @xmath62 in symmetric point .",
    "when @xmath2 and the bare masses are zero we get conformally invariant theory . it has the classical period matrix @xmath30 proportional to the matrix @xmath57 : @xmath63 .",
    "the spectral curve for this case was proposed in @xcite and , when the masses are set to zero , curve reads ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ; @xmath43 ) : and @xmath55 are modular forms expressed through the higher genus @xmath66-constants defined on @xmath67 y^2=^2-lx^2n_c y^2=x^2n_c-2fx^n_c+1 [ 2nc ]    this curve has the same form as ( [ 0nf ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) , with the associated period matrix @xmath68 having the same structure . from the computation of section 2",
    "one can easily see that this is not the case .",
    "moreover , it may be seen from ( [ pprep ] ) that even the perturbative coupling matrix is not proportional to the matrix @xmath57 anywhere on the moduli space if @xmath36 and @xmath69 ( see also @xcite ) .    the simplest way to see",
    "it is to compute @xmath30 in basis @xmath70 , @xmath34 .",
    "requirement for @xmath20 to be proportional to the classical matrix leads to the constraint on @xmath12 : @xmath71 which must be satisfied for any @xmath72 . since these equations have not nontrivial solutions , we come to the statement that @xmath73 at any point on the moduli space .",
    "furthemore , let us suppose that the @xmath2 curve is written as a polynomial of power @xmath74 ( for instance , as it was proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "one can compare the spectral curve for such a theory and for the @xmath28 one . since the both theories have the spectral curves which are polynomials of power @xmath74 and there are @xmath75 parameters ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) , one can adjust them so that the curves are getting identical ( up to @xmath79 transformations ) , and the corresponding theories have the same structure of the coupling matrices .",
    "but from the previous arguments based on perturbative results , we know that it does not take place . hence , the @xmath2 spectral curve is not a polynomial of power @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we demonstrate that , for @xmath2 , the spectral curve can not be hyperelliptic surface ( the double covering of @xmath37 ) .",
    "our conjecture is that , for scale invariant theories , covering of the sphere must be replaced by covering of elliptic curve with natural elliptic parameter @xmath80 .",
    "let us repeat the same procedure for the @xmath4 group in detail .",
    "analogously : t^(n_c)(v^(n_c))=t^(0 ) ( ) ; + t^(0)(v^(0))=t^(n_c ) ( 8 ) , n_c=2 [ rel ] we use it to relate the coefficients @xmath82 of the instanton expansion for the prepotential : ( a)= [ prep ] where @xmath83 .",
    "the order parameter is known from the picard - fuchs equation @xcite : u= ( aa -2)= a^2 [ order ] @xmath84 appears as the second derivative of the prepotential : t = i 2 [ tau2 ]    substituting @xmath27 and @xmath85 and inverting the series for @xmath86 , one gets @xmath87 :    * @xmath88 = * @xmath38 =    after insertion of these results into ( [ tau2 ] ) , we obtain the instanton expansion for @xmath84 ( @xmath89 ) :    * @xmath88 t^(0 ) = = + = [ tau20 ] * @xmath38 t^(2 ) = = + = [ tau22 ]    in order to check ( [ rel ] ) , one must substitute @xmath90 into ( [ tau22 ] ) : t^(0)(v^(0))=t^(n_c ) ( 8 ) = + comparison with the coefficients in ( [ tau20 ] ) yields the system of equations for the first two of them : @xmath91 it may seem not to be so interesting to deal with these equations , since one can get explicit expressions for the coefficients in terms of @xmath66-constants for these theories , nevertheless it allows to express immediately @xmath38 instanton terms through @xmath27 ones and provides the good consistency check for them . let us mention that the results of @xcite do not satisfy them .",
    "now let us prove the exact formula expressing @xmath3 through @xmath66 - constants=\\sum_{n \\in z}q^{(n+ \\half)^2}$ ] , @xmath92=\\sum_{n \\in z}q^{n^2}$ ] , @xmath93=\\sum_{n \\in z } ( -1)^n q^{n^2}$ ] ] @xcite : ^(0 ) = 2 i + ^(2 ) = 1 2 i [ su2 ] the @xmath94 curve is @xcite : y^2=x^4 - 2fx^2 + 1 + f= [ nf4 ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are rescaled by the vev @xmath86 .",
    "of course , @xmath87 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 depend on @xmath86 but @xmath84 .",
    "so we know the connection between the factor @xmath98 in equation ( [ nf4 ] ) for @xmath86 and @xmath84 .",
    "let us show it by direct calculation for the @xmath27 curve @xcite : y^2=(x^2-u)^2-^4 [ nf0 ] this equation may be rewritten in the form : y^2=x^4 - 2 x^2 + 1 [ nf01 ] from which ( using ( [ nf4 ] ) ) we get @xmath99 ( the result of @xcite ) , or , finally : ^4=u^2(1-f^-2)=u^2 ( 2_2 ^ 2 _ 3 ^ 2 _ 2 ^ 4+_3 ^ 4)^2 [ sol0 ]    one can easily integrate ( [ ab ] ) in terms of hyper - geometric functions : a = 2 _ x_+^x_- = - 2i x_++x_-f_2,1(,;1;(x_+- x_-)^2 ( x_++x_-)^2 ) + b = 2 _ -x_+^x_+ = 2x_-f_2,1(,;1;(x_+ x_-)^2 ) [ per ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are roots of ( [ nf0 ] ) .",
    "note also that @xmath97 has the form : b = 2x_-f_2,1(,;1;(x_+ x_- ) ^2 ) = 2x_++x_-f_2,1 ( , ; 1;4 x_+ x_-(x_+ + x_-)^2 ) [ per1 ] as it was mentioned above , @xmath84 is the ratio of periods : @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "solution to this equation is known ( see @xcite for example ) : @xmath104 which leads to the result ( [ sol0 ] ) after simple transformations .",
    "we have obtained it by comparing this @xmath27 curve ( [ nf0 ] ) and that with @xmath105 ( [ nf4 ] ) ( the method by minahan and nemechansky @xcite ) and by direct calculation , providing the evidence for the validity of this method ( by comparing the curves ) . in this way",
    ", we can get the exact @xmath3 - functions ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "they are in agreement with @xcite , but not with @xcite .",
    "we find first instanton corrections to the matrix of coupling constants at the symmetric point on the moduli space . comparing the spectral curves for the theories with different number of flavors , we get some useful relations between couplings and present the proof that the @xmath2 spectral curve could not be presented as a covering of the sphere .",
    "also we propose the strong evidence for the method of @xcite ( comparing the curves ) in the case of the @xmath4 gauge group .",
    "one can easily extend this technique to the theories with nonzero bare masses , but the requirement for the coupling matrix to be proportional to the classical one imposes some constraints on the masses ( or on their symmetric functions @xmath106 ) .",
    "some @xmath3 - functions for such theories are collected in the appendix .",
