    "in introductory electrostatics we learn that the electric field of a polarized object ( polarization @xmath0 electric dipole moment per unit volume ) is equivalent to the field produced by surface and volume  bound \" charges@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface ( pointing outward ) .",
    "this is easy to understand : polarization results in perfectly genuine accumulations of charge,@xcite differing from  free \" charge only in the sense that each electron is attached to a particular atom.@xcite    but is polarized material _ in every respect _ equivalent to such a distribution of bound charge ?",
    "for example , is the electric _ force _ on a polarized object the same as it would be on @xmath3 and @xmath4 ?",
    "what about the _ torque _ ? and how about the force and torque _ densities _ within the material ?",
    "the very notion of _ density _ ( whether of force , torque , energy , or even mass , charge , and dipole moment ) can be problematic .",
    "after all , matter is composed of atoms , and on a microscopic scale these quantities fluctuate wildly in position and time . we mean , however , their _ macroscopic _ averages over regions large enough to contain enormous numbers of atoms and yet small compared to the relevant dimensions of the object .",
    "we will confine our attention to classical macroscopic _ electromagnetic _ forces .",
    "of course , the atoms in a solid or liquid are subject to all sorts of  mechanical \" forces ( which may themselves be electromagnetic on a microscopic level ) , and they are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "but in this paper our purpose is to explore the role of bound charge , and to this end we adopt a radically simplified model : we imagine a continuum of ideal ( neutral ) point dipoles , described by a specified function * p*. how this polarization came to be , and what  mechanical \" forces sustain it , we do not inquire .",
    "( imagine , in the static case , that they are simply _ glued _ in position . )",
    "we are interested only in the electrical forces exerted on these dipoles by the ( macroscopic ) field * e * ( the _ total _ field , attributable both to the dipoles themselves and to any external sources ) .    if the question is  how does a particular deformable medium respond to externally applied fields ? \" then one requires detailed information about the structure of the material , its elastic and dielectric properties , the pressure , the temperature , and so on.@xcite our question is much simpler :  for a _ stipulated _ polarization , what is the _ electromagnetic _ force density , and in particular can it be calculated by replacing * p * with the associated bound charge ?",
    "\" we take it to be the ",
    "correct \" force density ( as distinct from the force density associated with bound charge ) , but remember that it does _ not _ include the  mechanical \" stresses that would also be present in any real material .    in section",
    "ii we rehearse the standard derivation of the electrostatic potential of a polarized object , in terms of the bound charge .",
    "we then apply the same reasoning to the force and torque on the object . in section iii",
    "we do the same for static magnetization , and in section iv we generalize to time - dependent configurations . in section",
    "v we compare our results with the einstein - laub force formula , and in section vi we draw some lessons and conclusions .",
    "let s review how bound charge is first introduced : the potential of an ideal dipole * p * is @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the vector from * p * , at @xmath7 , to the field point * r * ) .",

    "bound charge incorrectly distributes the force , even though it gets the total force right .",
    "this raises a surprisingly delicate question : what do we _",
    "mean _ by the  force density \" inside the medium ? presumably we should ( in the mind s eye ) isolate an infinitesimal piece , of volume @xmath21 , determine the force on it , and divided by @xmath21 .",
    "but this little piece carries _ surface _ bound charge in addition to its volume bound charge , and it s easy to see ( reading eqs .",
