    "the investigation of weak decays of mesons composed of a heavy quark and antiquark gives a very important insight in the heavy quark dynamics .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0 meson are of special interest , since it is the only heavy meson consisting of two heavy quarks with different flavor .",
    "this difference of quark flavors forbids annihilation into gluons . as a result ,",
    "the excited @xmath0 meson states lying below the @xmath9 production threshold undergo pionic or radiative transitions to the pseudoscalar ground state which is considerably more stable than corresponding charmonium or bottomonium states and decays only weakly . the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) collaboration @xcite reported the discovery of the @xmath0 ground state in @xmath10 collisions .",
    "more experimental data are expected to come in near future from the tevatron and large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the characteristic feature of the @xmath0 meson is that both quarks forming it are heavy and thus their weak decays give comparable contributions to the total decay rate .",
    "therefore it is necessary to consider both the @xmath11 quark decays @xmath12 with the @xmath13 quark being a spectator and @xmath13 quark decays @xmath14 with @xmath11 quark being a spectator .",
    "the former transitions lead to semileptonic decays to charmonium and @xmath3 mesons while the latter lead to decays to @xmath15 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the estimates of the @xmath0 decay rates indicate that the @xmath16 quark decays give the dominant contribution ( @xmath17 ) while the @xmath11 quark decays and weak annihilation contribute about 20% and 10% , respectively ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , from the experimental point of view the @xmath0 decays to charmonium are easier to identify .",
    "indeed , cdf observed @xmath0 mesons @xcite analysing their semileptonic decays @xmath18 .",
    "the important difference between the @xmath0 semileptonic decays induced by @xmath12 and @xmath19 transitions lies in the substantial difference of their kinematical ranges . in the case of @xmath0",
    "decays to charmonium and @xmath20 mesons the kinematical range ( the square of momentum transfer to the lepton pair varies from 0 to @xmath21  gev@xmath22 for decays to @xmath23 and @xmath24  gev@xmath22 for decays to @xmath3 mesons ) is considerably broader than for decays to @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons ( @xmath27  gev@xmath22 for decays to @xmath15 and @xmath28  gev@xmath22 for decays to @xmath2 mesons ) . as a result in the @xmath0 meson rest frame the maximum recoil momentum of the final charmonium and @xmath3 mesons is of the same order of magnitude as their masses ,",
    "while the maximum recoil momentum of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons is considerably smaller than the meson masses .    in this talk",
    "we consider semileptonic @xmath0 decays in the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach in quantum field theory .",
    "this model has been successfully applied for the calculations of mass spectra , radiative and weak decays of heavy quarkonia and heavy - light mesons @xcite . in our recent paper @xcite we applied this model for the investigation of properties of the @xmath0 meson and heavy quarkonia .",
    "the relativistic wave functions obtained there are used for the calculation of the transition matrix elements .",
    "the consistent theoretical description of @xmath0 decays requires a reliable determination of the @xmath29 dependence of the decay amplitudes in the whole kinematical range . in most previous calculations",
    "the corresponding decay form factors were determined only at one kinematical point either @xmath30 or @xmath31 and then extrapolated to the allowed kinematical range using some phenomenological ansatz ( mainly ( di)pole or gaussian ) .",
    "our aim is to explicitly determine the @xmath29 dependence of form factors in the whole kinematical range in order to avoid extrapolations thus reducing uncertainties .",
    "in the quasipotential approach a meson is described by the wave function of the bound quark - antiquark state , which satisfies the quasipotential equation @xcite of the schrdinger type @xcite @xmath32 where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the center of mass energies on mass shell given by @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the meson mass , @xmath38 are the quark masses , and @xmath39 is their relative momentum . in the center of mass system",
    "the relative momentum squared on mass shell reads @xmath40[m^2-(m_1-m_2)^2]}{4m^2}.\\ ] ]    the kernel @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ quas ] ) is the quasipotential operator of the quark - antiquark interaction .",
    "it is constructed with the help of the off - mass - shell scattering amplitude , projected onto the positive energy states .",
    "constructing the quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction , we have assumed that the effective interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term and the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli interaction .",
    "the quasipotential is then defined by @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath45 is the gluon propagator and @xmath46 ; @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the dirac matrices and spinors .",
    "the effective long - range vector vertex is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the pauli interaction constant characterizing the long - range anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks .",
    "vector and scalar confining potentials in the nonrelativistic limit reduce to @xmath51 reproducing @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "the expression for the quasipotential of the heavy quarkonia , expanded in @xmath54 without and with retardation corrections to the confining potential , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the structure of the spin - dependent interaction is in agreement with the parameterization of eichten and feinberg @xcite .",
    "the quasipotential for the interaction of a heavy quark with a light antiquark without employing the expansion in inverse powers of the light quark mass is given in ref .",
    "all the parameters of our model like quark masses , parameters of the linear confining potential @xmath55 and @xmath2 , mixing coefficient @xmath53 and anomalous chromomagnetic quark moment @xmath50 are fixed from the analysis of heavy quarkonium masses @xcite and radiative decays @xcite . the quark masses @xmath56",
    "gev , @xmath57 gev , @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 gev and the parameters of the linear potential @xmath60 gev@xmath22 and @xmath61 gev have usual values of quark models .",
    "the value of the mixing coefficient of vector and scalar confining potentials @xmath62 has been determined from the consideration of the heavy quark expansion for the semileptonic @xmath63 decays @xcite and charmonium radiative decays @xcite .",
    "finally , the universal pauli interaction constant @xmath64 has been fixed from the analysis of the fine splitting of heavy quarkonia @xmath65- states @xcite .",
    "note that the long - range magnetic contribution to the potential in our model is proportional to @xmath66 and thus vanishes for the chosen value of @xmath64 .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the correct reproduction of the spin - dependent quark - antiquark interaction requires either assuming the scalar confinement or equivalently introducing the pauli interaction with @xmath64 @xcite in the vector confinement .",
    "in order to calculate the exclusive semileptonic decay rate of the @xmath0 meson , it is necessary to determine the corresponding matrix element of the weak current between meson states . in the quasipotential approach ,",
    "the matrix element of the weak current @xmath67 , associated with @xmath68 ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) or @xmath71 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) transitions , between a @xmath0 meson with mass @xmath74 and momentum @xmath75 and a final meson @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) with mass @xmath78 and momentum @xmath79 takes the form @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the two - particle vertex function and @xmath82 are the meson ( @xmath83 wave functions projected onto the positive energy states of quarks and boosted to the moving reference frame with momentum @xmath84 .     contributing to the current matrix element ( [ mxet ] ) .",

    "the contribution @xmath85 is the consequence of the projection onto the positive - energy states .",
    "note that the form of the relativistic corrections resulting from the vertex function @xmath85 is explicitly dependent on the lorentz structure of the quark - antiquark interaction . in the leading order of the @xmath54 expansion for heavy quarkonia and in the heavy quark limit @xmath88 for heavy - light mesons only @xmath89 contributes , while @xmath85 contributes already at the subleading order .",

    "the @xmath99-function in the expression ( [ gamma1 ] ) for the vertex function @xmath89 permits to perform one of these integrations . as a result the contribution of @xmath89 to the current matrix element has the usual structure of an overlap integral of meson wave functions and can be calculated exactly ( without employing any expansion ) in the whole kinematical range , if the wave functions of the initial and final meson are known .",
    "the situation with the contribution @xmath85 is different . here , instead of a @xmath99-function",
    ", we have a complicated structure , containing the potential of the @xmath100-interaction in meson .",
    "thus in the general case we can not get rid of one of the integrations in the contribution of @xmath85 to the matrix element ( [ mxet ] ) . therefore",
    ", it is necessary to use some additional considerations in order to simplify calculations .",
    "the main idea is to expand the vertex function @xmath85 , given by ( [ gamma2 ] ) , in such a way that it will be possible to use the quasipotential equation ( [ quas ] ) in order to perform one of the integrations in the current matrix element ( [ mxet ] )",
    ".     * @xmath101 transitions . *",
    "the natural expansion parameters for @xmath0 decays to charmonium are the active heavy @xmath11 and @xmath16 quark masses as well as the spectator @xmath16 quark mass .",
    "we carry such an expansion up to the second order in the ratios of the relative quark momentum @xmath39 and binding energy to the heavy quark masses @xmath102 .",
    "it is important to take into account the fact that in the case of weak @xmath0 decays caused by @xmath12 quark transition the kinematically allowed range is large ( @xmath103 @xmath104  gev for decays to charmonium and @xmath105  gev for decays to @xmath3 mesons ) .",
    "this means that the recoil momentum @xmath106 of a final meson is large in comparison to the relative momentum @xmath39 of quarks inside a meson ( @xmath107  gev ) , being of the same order as the heavy quark mass almost in the whole kinematical range .",
    "thus we do not use expansions in powers of @xmath108 or @xmath109 , but approximate in the expression ( [ gamma2 ] ) for @xmath85 the heavy quark energies @xmath110 by @xmath111 , which become independent of the quark relative momentum @xmath39 .",
    "making these replacements and expansions we see that it is possible to integrate the current matrix element ( [ mxet ] ) either with respect to @xmath97 or @xmath98 using the quasipotential equation ( [ quas ] ) . performing integrations and taking the sum of the contributions of @xmath89 and @xmath85 we get the expression for the current matrix element , which contains ordinary overlap integrals of meson wave functions and is valid in the whole kinematical range .",
    "thus this matrix element can be easily calculated using numerical wave functions found in our meson mass spectrum analysis @xcite .     * @xmath112 transitions . * in this case the heavy @xmath11 quark undergoes the weak transition to the light @xmath113 quark .",
    "the constituent @xmath113 quark mass is of the same order of magnitude as the relative momentum and binding energy , thus we can not apply the expansion in inverse powers of its mass . nevertheless , taking into account the fact that the recoil momentum of the final meson in this decay is large almost in the whole kinematical range ( as it was discussed above )",
    ", we can neglect the relative momentum @xmath39 of quarks inside a meson with respect to the large recoil momentum @xmath106 .",
    "thus in the region of large recoil ( @xmath114 ) we can use the same expressions of the @xmath85 contribution to the current matrix element both for the @xmath115 and @xmath116 transitions . moreover , the smallness of the @xmath85 contribution , which is proportional to the small binding energy , and its weak dependence on momentum transfer allows one to extrapolate these formulae to the whole kinematical range . as numerical estimates show , such extrapolation introduces only small uncertainties .",
    "* @xmath117 transitions .",
    "* the heavy @xmath16 quark undergoes the weak transition to the light @xmath118 or @xmath119 quark .",
    "the constituent @xmath120 quark masses are of the same order of magnitude as the relative momentum and binding energy , thus we can not apply the expansion in inverse powers of their masses .",
    "the heavy quark expansion in @xmath121 significantly simplifies the structure of the @xmath85 contribution to the decay matrix element , but the momentum @xmath39 dependence of the light quark energies @xmath122 still prevents to perform one of the integrations .",
    "it is important to note that the kinematically allowed range for @xmath0 decays to @xmath15 and @xmath2 meson is not large ( @xmath103 @xmath123  gev for decays to @xmath15 and @xmath124  gev for decays to @xmath2 mesons ) .",
    "this means that the recoil momentum @xmath106 of a final meson is of the same order as the relative momentum @xmath39 of quarks inside a heavy - light meson ( @xmath107  gev ) in the whole kinematical range .",
    "taking also into account that the final @xmath15 and @xmath2 mesons are weakly bound @xcite , we can replace the light quark energies by the center of mass energies on mass shell @xmath125 .",
    "we used such a substitution in our analysis of heavy - light meson mass spectra @xcite which allowed us to treat the light quark relativistically without an unjustified expansion in inverse powers of its mass . making these replacements and expansions",

    "performing integrations and taking the sum of the contributions @xmath89 and @xmath85 we get the expression for the current matrix element , which contains ordinary overlap integrals of meson wave functions and is valid in the whole kinematical range .",
    "the matrix elements of the weak current @xmath127 for @xmath0 decays to pseudoscalar mesons @xmath128 can be parametrized by two invariant form factors : @xmath129 +    f_0(q^2)\\frac{m_{b_c}^2-m_p^2}{q^2}\\ q^\\mu,\\ ] ] where @xmath130 ; @xmath74 is the @xmath0 meson mass and @xmath131 is the pseudoscalar meson mass .",

    "@xmath0 decays in the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach in quantum field theory .",
    "the weak decay form factors were calculated explicitly in the whole kinematical range using the heavy quark expansion for the initial active heavy quark @xmath140 and spectator antiquark @xmath141 .",
    "the final light quark was treated completely relativistically without applying the unjustified expansion in inverse powers of its mass .",
    "the leading order contribution of the heavy quark expansion was treated exactly , while in calculating the subleading order contribution additional simplifying replacements were used .",
    "it was shown that such substitutions introduce only minor errors which are of the same order as the higher order terms in the heavy quark expansion .",
    "thus the decay form factors were evaluated up to the subleading order of the heavy quark expansion .",
