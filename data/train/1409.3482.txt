    "initially , the crossover from the weak - coupling ( bcs ) superfluid phase to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of molecules was mainly a theoretical idea @xcite .",
    "its experimental realization @xcite with ultracold trapped fermionic alkali atoms , whose interaction strength ( characterized by the scattering length @xmath0 ) can be tuned with the help of feshbach resonances , triggered a lot of activity from the theoretical side , not only in the context of cold atoms , but also in condensed matter and nuclear physics @xcite . while at zero temperature the mean - field ( bcs ) theory is believed to be reasonable throughout the crossover ( it reproduces the correct wave function of the dimers in the bec limit ) , it fails to describe the critical temperature @xmath1 : on the bec side , @xmath1 is not the temperature where pairs are formed , but the temperature where the `` preformed pairs '' condense @xcite . by taking into account correlations above @xmath1 in the calculation of the density ,",
    "nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) obtained a theory that correctly interpolates between the bcs and bec critical temperatures .",
    "the situation becomes more complex if the formation of cooper pairs is perturbed by a density or mass imbalance between the particles forming the pairs .",
    "apart from atomic gases and superconductors in magnetic fields , such situations may be realized in nuclear matter with different densities of neutrons and protons @xcite or in compact stars containing light and strange quarks @xcite .",
    "such systems have been extensively studied in the recent years .",
    "for instance , one still hopes to find the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase with a spatially oscillating order parameter @xcite , which was predicted theoretically a long time ago @xcite but which no experiment has seen so far .    in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on the case of a uniform fermi gas with two components ( denoted by @xmath2 in analogy with spin-1/2 systems ) having equal masses @xmath3 but different densities @xmath4 . although experiments are generally done in traps , they provide information about the uniform gas under the assumption of the validity of the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the experiments on the phase diagram of polarized fermi gases done at mit @xcite and paris @xcite can be well understood within the lda . only in an experiment at rice university @xcite ,",
    "clear deviations from lda were observed , but they were later shown to correspond to a metastable non - equilibrium configuration of the atomic cloud @xcite .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "different approaches were used to describe the finite - temperature phase diagram of the polarized fermi gas .",
    "let us mention the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and the wilsonian renormalization group approach of ref .",
    "also the nsr approach mentioned above was generalized to the polarized case @xcite .",
    "however , it turned out that it breaks down near the unitary limit ( @xmath5 ) : one finds that the sign of the polarization is opposite to that of the difference between the two chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "actually , there is already a problem in the unpolarized case , where the nsr approach gives a negative spin susceptibility @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , since a very similar approach , also based on the t matrix in ladder approximation , works very well in the extremely polarized limit at zero temperature ( `` polaron '' ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite or the @xmath7 approach by chen et al .",
    "@xcite , which was also applied to the polarized case @xcite . roughly speaking ,",

    "the goal of the present work is to develop a scheme similar to the nsr approach which allows us to describe the polarized fermi gas in the normal - fluid phase from the unpolarized case above @xmath1 up to the polaron limit .",
    "we will see that the problem of the nsr approach is caused by its non - selfconsistent treatment of the quasiparticle energy shift generated by the self - energy . by simply including this shift self - consistently in _ all _ lines of the feynman diagrams ,",
    "the problem of the unphysical sign of the polarization is avoided . within this framework",

    "the real part can be obtained from the imaginary part with the help of a dispersion relation , @xmath28    within the original nsr theory @xcite , the density is obtained from the thermodynamic potential in ladder approximation .",
    "this is equivalent to calculating the density from the green s function obtained by truncating the dyson equation at first order , i.e. , @xmath29 @xcite , where @xmath30 denotes the non - interacting green s function . as a consequence ,",
    "the density for each spin state has two contributions , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the density of an ideal fermi gas with chemical potential @xmath17 , and the correction @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the in - medium scattering phase shift . in the presence of a bound state ( @xmath36 ) , one has @xmath37 in the energy range between the bound - state energy and the continuum threshold .",

    "( [ rhocorrnsr ] ) , in the present approach the correlated density @xmath47 is independent of the spin @xmath23 .",
    "this is plausible since a correlated pair consists of one atom of each spin .",
    "the expression ( [ rhocorrzs ] ) for the correlated density was originally derived for the unpolarized case by zimmermann and stolz ( zs ) in ref .",
    "@xcite in a condensed - matter context and subsequently used in refs .",
    "@xcite to describe the bec - bcs crossover in nuclear matter .    for practical reasons ,",
    "in order to simplify the numerical calculations , we make an additional approximation : we replace the momentum dependent shift @xmath49 in the quasiparticle energies @xmath16 by a constant shift @xmath50 , calculated at the respective fermi surface , @xmath51 , i.e. , we use @xmath52 with this approximation , the t matrix @xmath24 and the self - energies @xmath22 are identical to those of the standard t - matrix approximation if one replaces the chemical potentials @xmath17 by `` effective '' ones @xmath53 actually , as long as one is not interested in the `` real '' chemical potentials @xmath17 , it is not necessary to compute the shift @xmath50 and all calculations can be done as functions of @xmath54 .",
    "however , the shift @xmath50 is needed if one is interested in the relation between the densities @xmath55 and the real chemical potentials @xmath17 .",
    "as we discussed before , the main difference between the mean - field approach on the one hand and the nsr and zs approaches on the other hand is the inclusion of pair correlations above @xmath1 in the calculation of the density .",
    "if we consider a sufficiently strong asymmetry of the densities or chemical potentials , we can calculate the correlation correction to the density as a function of temperature down to @xmath56 without ever reaching the superfluid phase . as an example , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : rhocorrvst ]    the temperature dependence of the correction to the density , @xmath47 , obtained within the present approach ( zs ) and the temperature dependence of the corrections @xmath33 obtained within the original nsr approach , normalized to the total density @xmath57 , in the unitary limit . in the nsr case , we kept the chemical potentials @xmath58 constant , with @xmath59 , whereas in the zs case , we fixed for simplicity the effective chemical potentials @xmath60 .",
    "one sees that the behaviors of the spin - independent correction @xmath47 in the zs case and of the spin - dependent ones , @xmath61 , in the nsr case are qualitatively different : in the zs case , the correction vanishes in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "in contrast , in the nsr scheme , the correction @xmath33 does not only account for correlations , but also for the mean - field like shift of quasiparticle energies ( which within the zs scheme is included in the effective chemical potentials @xmath54 ) .",
    "since the minority atoms ( @xmath62 ) feel a much stronger attractive `` mean field '' than the majority atoms ( @xmath63 ) , the nsr correction @xmath64 is much larger than @xmath65 , and both corrections remain finite at @xmath56 .    the fact that within the zs approach @xmath66 for @xmath67 is directly related to the luttinger theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that , at @xmath56 , the relationship between the density @xmath55 and the fermi momentum ( i.e. , the momentum where the occupation numbers are discontinuous ) , @xmath68 , remains unchanged even though correlations modify the occupation numbers .",
    "since this relation is already fulfilled with the uncorrelated occupation numbers @xmath69 , this implies that the integral of the correction @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath47 , must vanish at @xmath56 .",
    "our numerical results show that this is indeed the case .",
    "it is interesting to notice that by including the shift @xmath50 self - consistently , one apparently recovers in the @xmath67 limit the results of the @xmath56 formulation of the so - called `` particle - particle random - phase - approximation '' , where one starts from the beginning with green s function that depend on @xmath71 and not on @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "let us now have a look at the occupation numbers themselves . in fig .",
    "[ fig : occ ]    we show the occupation numbers for @xmath63 and @xmath62 atoms in the unitary limit for a given polarization @xmath72 for three different temperatures .",
    "let us first discuss the case of @xmath73 ( right panel ) . at first glance ,",
    "the change between uncorrelated ( @xmath74 ) and correlated ( @xmath42 ) occupation numbers seems to be very small in this case .",
    "one sees that @xmath42 is slightly reduced at small @xmath75 and slightly enhanced at large @xmath75 as compared with @xmath74 .",
    "however , the main effect becomes visible if we look at the asymptotic high - momentum tail shown in the inset . the correlated occupation numbers ( @xmath42 ) fall off like @xmath76 , the coefficient being the same for both spins , while the uncorrelated ones ( @xmath74 ) decrease of course exponentially .    at a lower temperature , @xmath77 ( central panel ) ,",
    "we see in addition to the increase of the correlated occupation numbers at high momenta a sizeable reduction at low momenta , especially for the minority component .",
    "this fits into the common picture of how correlations modify the occupation numbers at @xmath56 : particles are scattered out of the fermi sea , which reduces the occupation numbers below @xmath71 and leads to a finite occupancy of states above @xmath71 . in the present case ,",
    "the fermi surfaces are of course washed out by the finite temperature .    as it was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fact that the pairs are always formed of one @xmath63 and one @xmath62 atom implies that , at @xmath56 , the depletion of the particle number inside the fermi sphere is the same for both spins , i.e. , the occupation numbers of the minority ( @xmath62 ) species are necessarily more strongly reduced than those of the majority species ( @xmath63 ) . as we see",
    ", this effect persists at finite temperature .    at even lower temperature , @xmath78 ( left panel ) , we observe that the correlation correction to the minority occupation numbers becomes so strong that the occupation numbers @xmath79 become negative .",
    "this is of course unphysical and shows the limits of the perturbative treatment of the correlations , i.e. , of the truncation of the dyson series at first order in the self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ gperturbative ] ) .",
    "the same problem was found in ref .",
    "however , as soon as one goes more towards the bcs side of the crossover , this problem appears only at very low temperatures and very close to the critical polarization .",
    "before we consider the phase diagram of the polarized gas , let us briefly discuss the unpolarized case and compare our results with those of the original nsr theory .",
    "as in the nsr approach @xcite , the critical temperature is determined from the thouless criterion @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath81 but now , @xmath82 is calculated with the chemical potential @xmath83 ( in the unpolarized case we can drop the spin indices ) and the corresponding density is obtained from the zs formula ( [ rhocorrzs ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcs_nsr_zs ] ,    we display the critical temperature @xmath1 in units of the fermi energy @xmath84 as function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath85 characterizing the interaction strength . for the solid line ,",
    "@xmath86 was calculated with the density corrected by the zs formula ( [ rhocorrzs ] ) , while the dashed line was obtained with the standard nsr correlated density @xcite .",
    "both theories interpolate between the mean - field ( bcs ) result ( corresponding to @xmath87 without correction ; dotted line ) in the limit @xmath88 and the condensation temperature for an ideal gas of bosonic molecules in the limit @xmath89 ( bec , dash - dotted line ) .",
    "however , we see that on the side @xmath90 , the zs formula reaches the bcs limit much faster than the nsr one , which gives @xmath91 even for relatively weak interactions .",
    "this reduction of @xmath92 in the weak - coupling regime looks similar to the gorkov - melik - barkhudarov ( gmb ) correction @xcite to @xmath93 , however its origin is completely different : while the gmb correction is due to screening of the interaction in the medium , the reduction of @xmath92 comes from the non self - consistent treatment of the mean - field like shift in the original nsr theory .    coincidentally ,",
    "the critical temperatures obtained with the zs and nsr formulas in the unitary limit ( @xmath94 ) are very close to each other ( @xmath95 ) . although they are much lower than the bcs result ( @xmath96 ) , they are still too high because of missing screening effects : recent experimental values range from @xmath97 @xcite to @xmath98 @xcite .    on the bec side ( @xmath36 ) , the zs critical temperature goes through a minimum before it rises again and approaches the bec limit , whereas the nsr critical temperature goes through a maximum . qualitatively , the nsr behavior is in better agreement with qmc results @xcite than the zs one .",
    "the presence of a minimum in the zs critical temperature seems to be a general property of this approach , cf .",
    "the results in the literature for nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the polarized case .",
    "again , the critical temperature ( or polarization ) is determined by the appearance of a pole in the t matrix at @xmath99 , but in the polarized case it may happen that the pole appears first ( for decreasing temperature or polarization ) at a finite value of @xmath13 , corresponding to the transition to a fflo - like phase @xcite .",
    "therefore the condition to be in the normal phase reads : @xmath100    as mentioned in the introduction , the standard nsr theory presents in the polarized case a pathology near the unitary limit : for @xmath101 , one finds @xmath102 in large regions of the phase diagram @xcite . to illustrate this problem we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagnsr ]    the phase diagram obtained within the nsr scheme for @xmath103 .",
    "the pathology is present in the gray shaded region delimited by the dotted line .",
    "since the pathology extends down to @xmath104 , it implies that the spin susceptibility of the unpolarized gas is negative in some temperature range above @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the self - consistent treatment of the shift @xmath50 in our approach cures these problems .",
    "let us discuss the phase diagram within our approach as function of temperature @xmath19 and polarization @xmath105 .",
    "the phase diagrams for two different values of the interaction strength , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : phasediagunitary ]    and [ fig : phasediagbcs ] ,    respectively .",
    "the solid and dashed lines indicate the results obtained for the critical temperature @xmath1 within the generalized zs scheme , while the dotted lines are mean - field results , i.e. , what one obtains if one neglects the correlation contribution @xmath47 to the density .",
    "the cross marks the tricritical point where the phase transition is not longer towards the ordinary bcs - like superfluid or sarma phase ( @xmath108 ) but towards a fflo - like phase ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "since our formalism does not allow us to calculate the densities inside the superfluid phase , we can not draw the line separating these phases .",
    "in both cases , @xmath94 and @xmath107 , we checked that the difference between the real chemical potentials , @xmath110 , is always positive for @xmath111 , i.e. , the pathology of the nsr scheme is not present here .",
    "one sees that in the case @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagbcs ] ) , the bcs mean - field result clearly differs from that of the full calculation , but the difference is not dramatic .",
    "if one goes further to the bcs regime [ @xmath113 , the bcs mean - field and full calculations give practically identical results .",
    "however , as mentioned before , one should be aware of the fact that bcs mean - field theory as well as our calculation miss corrections due to screening of the in - medium interaction .",
    "therefore it seems likely that not only our critical temperatures , but also the critical polarizations are too high .    in the unitary limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagunitary ] ) , the inclusion of the correlated density @xmath47 changes the phase diagram completely , as expected from our results discussed above for the unpolarized case .",
    "again , compared with the results of the mit and ens experiments @xcite , the critical temperature @xmath1 we obtain at small polarization @xmath114 is still too high because of missing screening effects .    in the region of lower temperature and higher polarization ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "the experiment found a first - order phase transition ( phase separation ) , while we get a second - order phase transition towards the fflo phase in this region .",
    "we can not check whether there is a first - order phase transition since this requires to compare the energies of the paired and the unpaired phases , the former being inaccessible within our formalism .",
    "but it is clear that , if there was a first - order phase transition , the critical polarization would have to be higher than the one where we find the second - order phase transition .",
    "at very low temperature , the critical polarization increases a lot and exceeds by far the experimental one . actually , in our formalism , the critical polarization beyond which the system stays in the normal phase even at @xmath56 ( chandrasekhar - clogston limit ) is the same as the one obtained in mean - field theory .",
    "the reason for this is that , as discussed in the preceding section , the correlated density @xmath47 vanishes in the @xmath67 limit , as required by the luttinger theorem .",
    "this high value of the critical polarization is probably due to the uncorrelated occupation numbers @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) , which are almost step functions at low temperature .",
    "maybe a more self - consistent treatment of correlations , i.e. , the inclusion of correlated occupation numbers @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) , could improve the results . in nuclear physics ,",
    "such an approach is known as `` renormalized random - phase approximation '' @xcite , but it is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "by considering a very small polarization , we can determine the spin susceptibility of the unpolarized gas . to be precise , the spin susceptibility is defined as @xcite @xmath116 note that for the computation of @xmath110 ( not @xmath117 ) one needs the self - energy , cf .",
    "( [ eq : constantshift ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ,    we show the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility for @xmath106 ( solid line ) , in units of the spin susceptibility of an ideal fermi gas at zero temperature , @xmath118 .",
    "first of all , we see that @xmath6 is positive , which is already a good point . for comparison ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the susceptibility of an ideal fermi - gas , @xmath119 , is shown , too ( dotted line ) .",
    "it seems plausible that the susceptibility @xmath6 of the correlated system is lower than that of the ideal gas , @xmath119 , because the pairs made of @xmath63 and @xmath62 atoms resist against polarization .",
    "similar results were obtained by kashimura et al .",
    "@xcite within the etma ( dashes ) . very surprisingly , the experimental results for @xmath6 @xcite are close to @xmath119 or even higher",
    "however , one should notice that these data were determined very indirectly from a complicated non - equilibrium situation .",
    "although not related to the polarized fermi gas , we can also study the compressibility of the unpolarized gas above @xmath1 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the compressibility is defined as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the density per spin state .",
    "again , the computation of @xmath122 requires both the correlated density and the self - energy .",
    "our results for @xmath122 , normalized by the susceptibility of an ideal fermi gas at zero temperature , @xmath123 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ]    together with the ideal fermi - gas result @xmath124 and the experimental data from refs .",
    "we observe that the compressibility is higher than that of the ideal fermi gas , which is plausible for a system with attractive interaction . for @xmath125 ,",
    "our results agree very well with the experimental ones . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the nice agreement is lost . when @xmath19 approaches @xmath1 from above , a strong increase of the compressibility is found in both theory and experiment . however , since our @xmath1 is too high , we find this increase at a higher temperature than observed in experiment .",
    "although very successful in the description of the bcs - bec cross - over of an unpolarized two - component fermi gas , the nozires - schmitt - rink ( nsr ) approach fails in the case of finite polarization @xmath114 .",
    "as it was already pointed out in previous work @xcite , the nsr scheme gives in some regions of the phase diagram @xmath102 in spite of @xmath126 , and even in the unpolarized case the spin susceptibility has the wrong ( negative ) sign .    in this work",
    "we have suggested a way how to overcome the problems of the original nsr approach in the polarized case . as in the nsr scheme , we start from the ladder approximation for the t matrix and the single - particle self - energy @xmath22 .",
    "we split @xmath22 into a constant mean - field like shift @xmath50 and an energy - dependent part describing the correlations . while the correlations are treated perturbatively ,",
    "the shift @xmath50 is included self - consistently .",
    "this is different from the original nsr approach , where the self - energy @xmath22 as a whole is included only to first order in the truncated dyson series .",
    "we retrieve a well - known formula for the correlation correction to the density , originally derived by zimmermann and stolz ( zs ) @xcite for the unpolarized case .    within the zs scheme ,",
    "the correlation correction to the density , @xmath47 , does not depend on the spin , which is plausible since the correlated pairs are made of one atom of each spin .",
    "another interesting property of this approach is that @xmath47 vanishes in the limit @xmath67 , as required by the luttinger theorem . apparently , by including the energy shift @xmath50 one recovers in the @xmath67 limit the results of the particle - particle random - phase approximation formulated within the @xmath56 formalism @xcite .",
    "when calculating occupation numbers , one finds that near unitarity and at low temperature , the correlations become too strong to be treated perturbatively . apparently in these cases",
    "one can not avoid to sum the dyson series to all orders , as it was done , e.g. , in refs .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this work and it is also not clear whether such a resummation would respect , e.g. , the equality of the correlation densities of both spins and the luttinger theorem in the @xmath67 limit .    in the unpolarized case",
    ", the zs approach interpolates , as the nsr approach , between the bcs and bec limits , however it reaches the bcs limit much faster than the nsr approach .",
    "near the unitary limit , the critical temperatures for a given density are much lower than the bcs one but still too high because screening effects of the gorkov - melik - barkhudarov type @xcite are not included .",
    "in contrast to the nsr scheme , the zs scheme allows us to calculate the phase diagram also as a function of polarization , since the polarization has the same sign as the difference between the chemical potentials , as it should . at not too strong polarizations ,",
    "the generalized zs approach predicts a second - order phase transition towards a bcs- or sarma - like superfluid phase . at higher polarization and",
    "lower temperature , one finds instead a transition towards a fflo - like phase where the cooper pairs have a finite momentum .",

    ", one would need a theory that describes both the normal and the superfluid phase .",
    "another problem is the critical polarization for the transition towards the fflo phase at @xmath56 , which is much too high in our approach .",
    "the spin susceptibility of the unpolarized gas within our approach is positive , as it should be .",
    "it is smaller than that of an ideal fermi gas , which is also plausible .",
    "it agrees more or less with the theoretical prediction of the extended t matrix approximation ( etma ) @xcite and of the luttinger - ward theory @xcite , but not with the experimental results of ref .  @xcite .",
