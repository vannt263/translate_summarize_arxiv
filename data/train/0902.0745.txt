    "this is the fifth in a series of papers on a comparative direct analysis of the optical spectra of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) .",
    "papers  i  iv ( branch et  al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) were concerned with a time series of spectra of the spectroscopically normal sn  1994d , and with samples of sn",
    "ia spectra near maximum light , prior to maximum light , and after maximum light , respectively . in those papers ,",
    "the parameterized supernova synthetic spectrum code synow was used to study line identifications .",
    "since those papers were written , the sample of spectra available to us has increased substantially , thanks especially to a large number of spectra published by matheson et  al .",
    "the purposes of this paper are to examine similarities , differences , and relationships among the spectra of the expanded sample , and to consider the efficacy of sn  ia quantitative spectroscopic subclassification based on the equivalent widths of absorption features near 5750  and 6100 .",
    "as in the previous papers , we confine our attention to optical spectra , from the ca  ii h and k feature in the blue ( @xmath5 ) to the ca  ii infrared triplet ( ca  ii ir3 ) in the red ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "all spectra have been corrected for the redshifts of the host galaxies , and flattened according to the local normalization technique of jeffery et  al .",
    "mild smoothing has been applied to some of the spectra .",
    "the current sample of 186 spectra of 65 sne  ia ( table  1 ) is restricted to the following ranges of epochs with respect to the time of maximum light in the b band : an early sample ( day  @xmath7 or earlier ) ; a 1 week premaximum sample ( day  @xmath8 to day  @xmath9 ) ; a maximum light sample ( day  @xmath10 to day  + 3 ) ; a 1 week postmaximum sample ( day  + 6 to day  + 8) ; a 3 weeks postmaximum sample ( day  + 19 to day  + 23 ) ; and a 3 months postmaximum sample ( day  + 80 to day  + 100 ) . the only difference from previous papers of this series is that now , with more spectra available , the 1 week premaximum sample is from day  @xmath8 to day  @xmath9 , rather than from day  @xmath11 to day  @xmath12 as in paper  iii .",
    "in paper  ii we divided the maximum light spectra of sne  ia into four groups : core normal ( cn ) , broad line ( bl ) , cool ( cl ) , and shallow silicon ( ss ) .",
    "the group assignments were made on the basis of measurements of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the ( pseudo ) equivalent widths of absorption features near 5750  and 6100 , as well as on the appearance ( depth , width , and shape ) of the 6100  absorption .",
    "the 6100  absorption is produced by the si  ii 6355 transition and the 5750  absorption usually is attributed to si  ii 5972 .",
    "a comparison of the 5750  and 6100  absorptions in maximum light spectra of the four groups is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the extreme bl sn  2006x has a very broad 6100  absorption but only a weak 5750  absorption ; the 6100  absorption of the extreme cl sn  1991bg is comparable to that of the cn sn  1998bu ( except less blueshifted ) but the 5750  absorption is strong ; and the extreme ss sn  1991 t has only a shallow 6100  absorption and hardly any 5750  absorption .",
    "( sn  1991 t would be less different from the others if a spectrum closer to maximum light was available . ) in papers ii  iv the presentation and discussion were in terms of the four groups , although it was suggested that for the most part the spectra appeared to have a continuous distribution of properties , rather than breaking up into discrete subgroups  extreme ss sn  2002cx  likes being an apparent exception , and extreme cl sn  1991bg  likes being a possible exception .    in paper  ii @xmath3 was plotted against @xmath4 for the 24 sne of the maximum light sample . for the present paper all equivalent widths ( table  1 )",
    "have been measured in a manner similar to that described by hachinger et  al .",
    "the flattening of the spectra has no significant effect on our measurements . since each set of equivalent widths reported by us are for a specific spectrum obtained within 3 days of maximum light , while those reported by hachinger et  al .",
    "are based on multiple spectra obtained within 5 days of maximum light and extrapolated or interpolated to maximum light , exact agreement is not expected .",
    "for the 22 sne in both of our samples , the mean absolute differences in @xmath3 and @xmath4 are 2.7  and 4.7 , respectively .",
    "figure  2 shows our current equivalent width plot , for 59 sne .",
    "in general figure  2 resembles its counterpart in paper  ii , but now with more than double the data .",
    "the plot is most densely populated in the cn region , with members of the other groups more widely dispersed . for the present sample the domains of the four groups do not overlap , except for the maverick cl sn  1989b , which will be discussed in   6 .",
    "features that were not present in the plot of paper  ii include ( 1 ) the presence of other cls in the vicinity of sn  1986 g , which had been rather isolated before , and ( 2 ) the clump of four sss near @xmath1350 , @xmath148 .",
    "these two developments will be discussed in   6 and ",
    "figure  3 is like figure  2 but for the 28 sne for which hachinger et  al .",
    "report @xmath3 and @xmath4 values [ @xmath15 and @xmath16 in their notation ] , and with our group symbols .",
    "the distribution of sne in figure  3 is much like that of figure  2 although with less data .",
    "figure  4 is like figure  2 , but also showing @xmath3 and @xmath4 values measured from synthetic spectra for the si  ii ion , generated with the synow code .",
    "( synow is discussed in previous papers of this series .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is the velocity at the photosphere ; @xmath18 is the e  folding velocity of the line optical depths ; @xmath19 is an optional maximum velocity of the line  forming region , and @xmath20 is the excitation temperature used to determine the relative optical depths of lines of an ion . )",
    "several example si  ii synthetic spectra are shown in figure  5 .",
    "the results in figure  4 are generally consistent with how we fitted maximum light spectra in paper  ii .",
    "we used @xmath21  for cns and larger values for bls . for cls",
    "we imposed maximum velocities on si  ii , in order to saturate the @xmath4 values and obtain high values of @xmath3 by means of high line optical depth .",
    "overall , the lines in figure  4 provide a good overview of the interpretation , at the synow level , of the distribution of the sne in this plot .",
    "however , the true nature of sn  ia spectra in the region of the 5750  and 6100  absorptions may be more complicated , in some cases involving s  ii , fe  ii , and fe  iii as well as si  ii ( bongard et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "this may be why the positions of some sss in figure  4 are not accounted for by synow spectra that contain only lines of si  ii .",
    "values ( very steep optical  depth gradients ) , @xmath22 , fall farther to the left in figure  4 , near most of the sss , but the synthetic line profiles are not good matches to the observed ones . ] .    on the basis of five spectroscopic and photometric parameters other than @xmath3 and @xmath4 , benetti et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) assigned 26 sne  ia to three groups : faint ; high temporal velocity gradient ( hvg ) ; and low temporal velocity gradient ( lvg ) . as discussed in paper  ii , apart from a few borderline exceptions their faint group corresponds to our cls ; their hvg group corresponds to our bls ; and their lvg group includes both our cns and sss .",
    "our understanding of the correspondence between our groups and those of benetti et  al .",
    ", as discussed in paper  ii , has not changed .",
    "the number of cns has increased from 7 in paper  ii to 15 now .",
    "the new ones are sn 1997dt , sn  1998v , sn  1998eg , and sn  2000fa ( matheson et  al . 2008 ) , sn  2003cg ( elias  rosa et  al .",
    "2006 ) , sn  2003du ( stanishev et  al .",
    "2007a ) , sn  2004s ( krisciunas et  al . 2007 ) , and sn  2005cf ( garavini et  al .",
    "2007 ; wang et  al . 2009 ) .    by definition , at maximum light cns",
    "have very similar spectra , except for differing strengths of high velocity ( hv ) ca  ii features that form above 20,000 . among the new ones",
    "sn  2004s and sn  2005cf , like sn  2001el of paper  ii , have strong hv ca  ii at maximum light .",
    "cns are somewhat more diverse at 1 week premaximum and much more diverse at early times ( paper  iii ) .    at postmaximum epochs cns",
    "remain impressively homogeneous . in paper",
    "iv we attempted to illustrate the high degree of homogeneity of cns at 3 months postmaximum by plotting the logarithm of the flux with vertically displaced spectra .",
    "a better illustration of the homogenity is presented in figure  6 , which overplots the ( non  logarithmic ) flux spectra of the 6 cns of the 3 month postmaximum sample .",
    "considering observational error and that the epochs of the spectra range from day  + 83 to day  + 91 , the homogeneity from 4000  to 7000  is remarkable and as argued in paper  iv is incompatible with the usual assumption that the spectra at these epochs ( and even earlier ) consist of optically thin emission lines . instead ,",
    "the blue part of the spectrum is dominated by resonance scattering features of permitted fe  ii lines and the na  i feature . to the red of 7000  ",
    "the confusion is due to noise in the sn  1996x spectrum , to the differing strengths and amounts of deredshifting of the 7600    terrestrial absorption , and to warping of the ends of some of the spectra by the local normalization process .",
    "nevertheless , we can not exclude that some of the differences are real , perhaps due to differing strengths of [ ca  ii ] emission lines in this region of low permitted line opacity . to the red of the ca  ii ir3 absorption near 8250",
    ", the spectrum may consist mainly of optically thin emission lines , as usually assumed .",
    "however , the overall shape of spectra modelled with only optically thin forbidden lines will differ from the shape of spectra modelled with forbidden and permitted lines , because the optically thick permitted lines in the blue will transfer flux to the red .",
    "the number of bls has increased from 7 in paper  ii to 20 now .",
    "the new ones are sn  1997do , sn  1998dh , sn  1998ec , sn  1999cc , sn  1999cl , sn  1999ej , sn  1999gd , sn  1999gh , and sn  2000b ( matheson et  al .",
    "2008 ) , sn  2002dj ( pignata et  al . 2008 ) , sn  2004dt ( altavilla et  al .",
    "2007 ) , and sn  2006x ( wang et  al .",
    "maximum light spectra are not available for sn  1997do , sn  1999gh , and sn  2000b , but it is clear from their 1 week postmaximum spectra that they should be classified as bl .    at maximum light bls seem to have the same spectral features as cns , but the 610 values are higher .",
    "some bls are not very different from cn , so there is no reason to suppose a lack of continuity from cns to these mild bls .",
    "extreme bls have very high 610 values but not high @xmath3 values , because ( in synow analyses ) the si  ii optical depth gradient is low ( @xmath18 is high ) and the optical depth at the photosphere of 6355 is significant but not very high .",
    "this causes the 6355 absorption to extend over a wide velocity range , while the optical depth of the weaker 5972 transition is too low to produce significant absorption .",
    "although figure  2 does not support any lack of continuity among bls , it is clear that there is no single parameter sequence from cns to extreme bls .",
    "for example , the comparison in figure  7 of the maximum light spectra of three extreme bls ( sn  2002bf , sn  2004dt , and sn  2006x ) that are clustered at the lower right of figure  2 , shows that although the three have similar very broad 6100    absorptions , sn  2004dt strongly differs from sn  2002bf and sn  2006x in several respects .",
    "the most obvious one is that sn  2004dt lacks strong absorption in the range 4800    to 5100   , which in synow analyses is attributed to hv fe  ii ( paper  ii ) .",
    "sn  2002bf and sn  2006x do have strong hv fe  ii absorption , with the corresponding emission partially filling in their s  ii absorptions and making them appear weaker than in sn  2004dt .    at 1 week",
    "premaximum , bls are distinguishable from cn , but at the earliest times the cn diversity is such that there is some overlap between cn and bl . at one week",
    "postmaximum , strong hv fe  ii and partially filled in s  ii remains a distinguishing characteristic of most extreme bls ( see figures  5 and 6 of paper  iv ) , but mild bls are barely distinguishable from cn . by three weeks",
    "postmaximum , even extreme bls are similar to cn .",
    "the number of cls at maximum light has increased from 5 in paper  ii to 11 now .",
    "the new ones are sn  1998bp , sn  1998de , sn  2000cn , and sn  2000dk ( matheson et  al .",
    "2008 ) , sn  2004eo ( pastorello et  al . 2007 ) , and sn  2005bl ( taubenberger et  al .",
    "a maximum light spectrum is not available for sn  2000cn , but it is clear from its 1 week premaximum and 3 weeks postmaximum spectra that it should be classified as cl .",
    "when paper  ii was written , the sample of maximum light cls consisted of sn  1991bg and two other extreme cls , all with strong ti  ii absorption ; one less extreme cl , sn  1986 g , with weaker ti  ii ; and one marginal cl , sn  1989b , with no identifiable ti  ii absorption .",
    "extreme sn  1991bg  like cls have at times been regarded as a distinct sn  ia subgroup , but in paper  ii we argued that there may be continuity from cns through sn  1986 g to sn  1991bg .",
    "it is interesting that among the five new maximum light cl spectra sn  2005bl is sn  1991bg  like , sn  1998de resembles sn  1986 g , and three others ( sn  1998bp , sn  2000dk , and sn  2004eo ) are very similar to each other and similar to sn  1986 g except for a lack of identifiable ti  ii absorption .",
    "figure  8 compares sn  1998bp , sn  2000dk , and sn  2004eo to sn  1986 g . in lte",
    "the ti  ii strength increases rapidly with decreasing temperature ( hatano et  al .",
    "1999 ) , so sn  1986 g may just be slightly cooler than the others of figure  8 .",
    "differences in titanium abundance may also be involved ( taubenberger et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "the existence of several sne ( sn  1998de , in addition to those of figure  8) that resemble the intermediate cl sn  1986 g strengthens the case for continuity ( although probably not a single parameter sequence ) from cn to extreme sn  1991bg  like cls .    in figure",
    "2 sn  1989b is in the domain of bls .",
    "nevertheless , in paper  ii sn  1989b was included with cls on the grounds that at maximum light its features are better resolved than those of bls and that its 6100  absorption is almost identical to that of the cl sn  1986 g .",
    "the mild cl sn  2004eo now provides support for associating sn  1989b with cls .",

    "sn  2004eo is a mild cl ( figure  8) , and in many respects the spectra of sn  1989b resemble those of sn  2004eo ; for example , at 1 week premaximum the spectra are very similar ( figure  9 ) .",

    "this series of papers has been confined almost entirely to optical spectra , but it is natural to wonder about the absolute magnitudes of the four spectroscopic groups . for our present sample",
    "the problem is that most host galaxies are not in the hubble flow , which makes it difficult to compile a consistent set of distances . to estimate absolute magnitudes we have used data from reindl et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) and tammann , sandage , & reindl ( 2008 ) , including their estimates of host galaxy extinction .",
    "distances in order of preference are based on ( 1 ) a hubble constant of 65 km  s@xmath23  mpc@xmath23 provided that host galaxy recession velocity exceeds 2000 km  s@xmath23 , ( 2 ) cepheids and/or the tip of the red giant branch , and ( 3 ) membership in the virgo , fornax , or ursa major clusters . the resulting phillips relation ( phillips et  al .",

    "these names are descriptive of the extreme members of the groups , but it is important to emphasize that the new data that have become available for this paper reinforce the impression that sne  ia have a continuous distribution of spectroscopic properties rather than consisting of physically discrete subgroups .

    "some bls and sss differ only mildly from cn and now , with several new cls resembling the moderate cl sn  1986 g , it seems likely that continuity also extends from cns to extreme cls .",
    "however , neither bls nor sss consist of single  parameter sequences extending from mild to extreme members , and the same appears to be true of cls .",
    "it is not yet clear whether , apart from cns , there is additional `` clumping '' in the spectroscopic properties ; e.g. , it will be interesting to see whether the apparent relatively high frequency of sn  1999aa  likes proves to be real or coincidental .",
