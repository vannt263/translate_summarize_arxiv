    "let us consider the general class of systems exhibiting the macroscopic flow of some quantity .",
    "familiar examples include electric conduction systems , heat conduction systems and driven colloidal systems .",
    "such systems often exist in states in which the current is stationary .",
    "we refer to these states as _ nonequilibrium steady states_. nonequilibrium steady states are the simplest type of nonequilibrium states .",
    "however , even for the class consisting of such simple states , there presently exists no universal framework to calculate macroscopic properties of systems from microscopic information , in contrast to the class of equilibrium states , for which macroscopic properties can be calculated from the partition function of the system , employing the well - established theory of statistical mechanics .    at the present time",
    ", there exists a theory of nonequilibrium systems only for the regime very near equilibrium .",
    "this so - called _ linear response theory _ consists of a set of universal relations , which includes the green - kubo relation , the fluctuation - response relation and the einstein - relation .",
    "these relations relate the dynamical properties of fluctuations in systems under equilibrium conditions to linear transport properties of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the validity of these relations has been confirmed by both experimental and theoretical investigations @xcite .    in recent years , properties regarding fluctuations and linear responses to perturbations",
    "have been investigated for nonequilibrium states even outside the linear response regime , in steady state systems @xcite , aging systems @xcite and other systems @xcite .",
    "obviously , we can not expect the relations proved within linear response theory to be generally valid outside the linear response regime .",
    "however , there have been several relations proposed and investigated recently that represent extensions of the relations in linear response theory to systems far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we wish to acquire a systematic understanding of these extended relations among fluctuations and response properties , aiming at the construction of a statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium systems far from equilibrium . for this purpose , first it is necessary to grasp the essence of the basic framework of linear response theory , in particular focusing on the elucidation of the interrelations among the linear response relations , thermodynamics and equilibrium statistical mechanics .    of course , all of the relations in linear response theory can be derived by applying a formal perturbative expansion to quantum or classical mechanical descriptions on the basis of equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , such formal derivations of these relations does not illuminate the physical picture ( see section [ s : dis ] ) . in this paper , instead of applying a formal perturbation theory to quantum or classical mechanical systems , we attempt to elucidate the essence of linear response theory by studying stochastic many - body systems .    among the various types of stochastic many - body systems ,",
    "we choose to investigate two kinds of one - dimensional nonequilibrium lattice gases in which particles hop stochastically from one lattice site to another according to a given transition rate @xcite . specifically , we study a driven lattice gas , in which particles are driven by an external driving force in the bulk , and a boundary - driven lattice gas , in which particles are driven by the difference in chemical potential between two particle reservoirs in contact with the boundaries .",
    "although we choose these models for their mathematical simplicity , it is straightforward to apply the method of proof to other stochastic many - body systems , such as langevin systems that describe the motion of many beads in a liquid .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s :",
    "assmp ] , we state our physical point of view and the basic assumptions used in the derivation of the linear response relations . in section",
    "[ s : model ] , we introduce a one - dimensional driven lattice gas . in section",
    "[ s : gk ] , we present a simple derivation of the green - kubo relation , employing a key identity , with which various universal relations characterizing nonequilibrium steady states can be derived . in section [ s :",
    "frr ] , we derive the fluctuation - response relations and elucidate its connection to equilibrium statistical mechanics . in section",
    "[ s : ein ] , we derive the einstein relation for the model , and clarify the connections among these three universal relations and thermodynamics . in section [ s : b ] , we derive the green - kubo relation for a boundary - driven lattice gas , which is a different type of nonequilibrium lattice gas , in order to demonstrate the generality of our argument .",
    "finally , in section [ s : dis ] , we give several important remarks concerning linear response theory .",
    "let us recall that the macroscopic properties of an equilibrium system can be investigated with statistical mechanics using an effective multi - dimensional variable @xmath0 and the corresponding effective hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , in order to obtain such a description , the variable @xmath0 , described statistical mechanically , need not constitute a complete set of mechanical variables that specifies the microscopic state in classical or quantum systems .",
    "for example , consider a system consisting of many beads suspended in a liquid . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 can be regarded as representing the set of centers of mass of the beads , with @xmath1 describing the effective interactions between them .",
    "the effect of the liquid can be included in this effective hamiltonian @xmath1 .    here",
    ", we suppose that the set of variables @xmath2 provides a complete mechanical description of the system under consideration . for the bead system ,",
    "@xmath3 is defined so that @xmath2 represents all the positions and conjugate momenta of the atoms composing the beads and the liquid in an adiabatic container .",
    "now , we consider a nonequilibrium system which is such that the degrees of freedom represented by @xmath3 remain in equilibrium , while only those represented by @xmath0 are in a nonequilibrium state .",
    "it is not certain that such an assumption would be valid , and in general the degree of error it introduces would depend on the system we consider .",
    "physically , this assumption seems reasonable in the case that the typical time scale of @xmath0 , @xmath4 , is much longer than that of @xmath3 , @xmath5 .",
    "we consider such a case and introduce a time interval @xmath6 satisfying @xmath7 . in the argument below , we refer the subsystem composed of the degrees of freedom @xmath3 as the _ heat bath_. because this heat bath is assumed to be always in equilibrium , its temperature , @xmath8 , is defined for nonequilibrium states of the remaining degree of freedom .    in order to describe the nonequilibrium states of such systems , we need to determine the time evolution of the variable @xmath0 on the time scale of the interval @xmath6 . due to the separation of time scales represented by the relation @xmath9",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that @xmath0 is described by a markov stochastic process with a transition probability @xmath10 .",
    "the fundamental assumption in this paper is expressed by the local detailed balance condition @xmath11 where @xmath12 . here ,",
    "the boltzmann constant is set to unity .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 represents the energy transferred from this heat bath , which we call heat , during the time evolution symbolized by @xmath14 taking place over the time interval @xmath6 .    in the system under equilibrium conditions , because the energy conservation expressed as @xmath15 should hold , ( [ ldb : alpha ] ) becomes the detailed balance condition of the transition probability : @xmath16 with respect to the canonical distribution @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a normalization constant . combining ( [ db : alpha ] ) with the normalization condition of the probability , @xmath19 , we derive @xmath20 this equality implies that ( [ pcan : alpha ] ) is the stationary distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "this result is consistent with equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "also , it turns out that the detailed balance condition ( [ db : alpha ] ) implies time - reversal symmetry in the sense that the two - time joint probability @xmath21 is invariant under the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "by contrast , in the case of a nonequilibrium state , it is not easy to obtain a physical interpretation of ( [ ldb : alpha ] ) .",
    "we explain the origin of the name _ local detailed balance condition _ in section [ s : model ] , and demonstrate that all the universal relations can be derived from this assumption in sections [ s : gk ] , [ s : frr ] , and [ s : ein ] . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we explain how the local detailed balance condition ( [ ldb : alpha ] ) places restrictions on the allowed types of interactions with the heat bath .    in order to demonstrate this point explicitly , we consider a many - body bead system in which an external driving force is applied to the beads .",
    "we wish to derive the transition probability @xmath23 over an infinitesimally small time interval @xmath6 , using the local detailed balance condition , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) represents the position of the @xmath26-th bead .",
    "first , note that the mechanical force acting on the @xmath26-th bead is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a one - body potential ( e.g. a spatially periodic potential ) , @xmath29 is the interaction potential between beads , and @xmath30 is an external driving force . then , because the change in momentum is much smaller than the dissipative force in this situation , the averaged motion caused by the force @xmath31 is determined by the force balance equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the dissipation constant , and @xmath34 is the average of @xmath35 during the transition , given by @xmath36.\\ ] ]    under the influence of the interactions with molecules in the liquid , the positions of the beads fluctuate around this averaged motion . because we choose @xmath6 to be much larger than the time scale characterizing the dynamics of the molecules",
    ", we expect that these fluctuations exhibit a gaussian distribution with a dispersion proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "that is , it is reasonable to express the fluctuations by the transition probability @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a normalization factor , @xmath40 is a parameter which represents the strength of the interaction with the heat bath , and @xmath41 should be interpreted as @xmath42 we wish to determine @xmath40 in ( [ trans : bead ] ) from the local detailed balance condition . in order to do this , we consider the following ratio of transition probabilities : @xmath43 in this expression , it should be noted that the quantity @xmath44 is the work done by the force @xmath34 , which is equal to the heat dissipated into the heat bath @xcite during the transition from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "then , by comparing ( [ ldp : bead ] ) with the local detailed balance condition ( [ ldb : alpha ] ) , we find the relation @xmath47 in this way , we have determined the transition probability ( [ trans : bead ] ) , with the explicit form of @xmath40 from the local detailed balance condition ( [ ldb : alpha ] ) .",
    "note that the stochastic process given by the transition probability ( [ trans : bead ] ) can be expressed as @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents brownian motion satisfying @xmath50 then , taking the limit @xmath51 , we obtain the langevin equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents zero - mean gaussian white noise with @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is a unit matrix .",
    "the condition ( [ 2nd ] ) is called the _ fluctuation - dissipation relation of the second kind _ for the langevin equation ( [ model : bead ] ) with ( [ noise ] ) .",
    "we can derive all the universal relations in linear response theory for the langevin equation ( [ model : bead ] ) with ( [ 2nd ] ) and ( [ noise ] ) .",
    "however , this derivation is complicated when mathematical rigor is maintained . instead of the langevin model , we study a lattice gas , which also serves as a model of many - body beads systems , to avoid the complicated analysis that is irrelevant to the essence of linear response theory .    in a lattice gas ,",
    "particles hop stochastically from one lattice site to another at a given transition rate .",
    "particularly , when two or more particles can not be placed at one site , the equilibrium state is described by a hamiltonian which is equivalent to that for a spin model with a variable transformation . for mathematical simplicity",
    ", the form of the hamiltonian usually corresponds to the ising model . in subsection",
    "[ s : model : lg ] , we explain the one - dimensional equilibrium lattice gas . a two or higher dimensional model can be easily interpreted from the one - dimensional case .",
    "a _ driven _ lattice gas , introduced in subsection [ s : model : dlg ] , is defined by minimally modifying to the equilibrium lattice gas so that it exhibits nonequilibrium steady states .",

    "we present remarks on these two topics .",
    "it is well known that the universal relations of linear response theory can be derived from a microscopic description in the following way .",
    "( i ) the system under consideration is assumed to be in equilibrium at @xmath398 ; that is , the distribution of microscopic variables is assumed to be canonical at @xmath199 .",
    "( ii ) an external force is applied to the system under the assumption that the time evolution obeys the liouville and von neumann equations .",
    "this assumption implies that the system does not interact with other dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "( iii ) the statistical average of the quantity of interest at time @xmath131 is calculated perturbativelly up to linear order in the applied external force .",
    "within such a framework , it is straightforward to derive the linear response relations , but it is difficult to understand the physical picture .",
    "for example , let us consider an electric conduction system .",
    "in such a system , energy is continuously introduced into the system when an electric field is applied .",
    "thus , obviously , a steady state is never realized unless the system contact with a heat bath .",
    "then , recalling the step ( ii ) described above in the previous paragraph , it can be claimed that the formal calculation is not performed based on the realization of nonequilibrium steady states , even if the desired formulas can be derived by this method .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the time correlation ( e.g. current correlations ) in the formal perturbation scheme is calculated by use of mechanical time evolution equations without identifying the degrees of freedom that constitute the heat bath .",
    "if the energy dissipation into the heat bath is taken into account when the time correlation is calculated , it is plausible that the result of the calculation would depend on the nature of the heat bath .",
    "indeed , in the stochastic models studied in this paper , the functional form of the time correlation depends on the choice of the stochastic rule ( e.g. ( [ mt ] ) , ( [ hb ] ) , and ( [ sym ] ) ) , which represent the nature of the heat bath , though the validity of the universal relations is independent of this choice .    considering these points , we find that we do not obtain a clear understanding of nonequilibrium systems , even in the linear response regime , when we study systems on the basis of a microscopic description . here",
    ", let us recall our method of derivation for the universal relations in the stochastic models . in our derivations",
    ", the steady state is prepared from the outset , and all the relations can be obtained by use of the local detailed balance condition .",
    "thus , focusing on the realization of nonequilibrium steady states and the local detailed balance condition , we suggest that the two problems described below should be studied in microscopic systems .    the first problem is to clarify the conditions under which a subsystem exhibiting a nonequilibrium steady state is determined in a purely mechanical system despite a continuous injection of energy .",
    "( note that a nonequilibrium system with a gaussian thermostat @xcite is not regarded as a purely mechanical system of the type we wish to study . )",
    "then , we characterize the heat bath by studying the mechanism of the energy dissipation , but it is not certain that a simple characterization is possible . if we succeed in the proper characterization , the second problem is to demonstrate the validity of the local detailed balance condition for these states . then , given the local detailed balance condition , it is straightforward to derive universal relations . in this way , through the present study , we have identified a new direction in the investigation of the nature of nonequilibrium systems on the basis of a microscopic description",
    ".      one may wonder whether it is possible to extend linear response theory to systems far from equilibrium . a partial answer to this question",
    "is provided by the nonlinear response relation given in ( [ ident0 ] ) , which provides a starting point to connect transport properties of systems far from equilibrium with dynamical fluctuations .",
    "indeed , when kawasaki and gunton derived an expression for the nonlinear shear viscosity from the liouville equation , the nonlinear response formula @xcite , which takes essentially the same form as ( [ ident0 ] ) , played a key role .",
    "there is another approach to the extension of the universal relations that does not involve nonlinear response theory . in this approach , instead of studying nonlinear transport properties , the linear response properties near nonequilibrium",
    "steady states are studied by applying small perturbations as probes .",
    "it is believed that there is a close relationship between the linear response properties and the dynamical fluctuation properties , although , obviously , the universal relations that hold within the linear response regime can not be valid in general outside this regime . unlike the nonlinear response theory represented by ( [ ident0 ] ) ,",
    "this type of extension of the universal relations beyond the linear response regime has not yet been established .    as a preliminary step in the attempt to employ this second type of approach to construct an extension of the universal relations to systems far from equilibrium ( i.e. outside the linear response regime ) , recently",
    ", numerical experiments on a two - dimensional driven lattice gas were performed @xcite . according to the results of this study , with respect to the properties of the system along the direction transverse to the external driving force",
    ", the linear responses of the system to perturbation forces are related to the fluctuations in the same form as the linear response relations . here , it is important to note that in the direction transverse to the external driving force , the thermodynamic free energy , from which we can obtain the probability distribution for density fluctuations , was constructed using the maxwell relation @xcite .",
    "( the maxwell relation is the integrability condition yielding the free energy . )",
    "we conjecture that the validity of the extended forms of the linear response relations @xcite is related to the existence of the thermodynamic function constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , recalling the argument given in section [ s : ein ] .",
    "although these numerical results for states far from equilibrium are interesting , our understanding of the extended relations remains poor .",
    "in particular , there are the following two serious problems .",
    "first , it is well known that long - range spatial correlations of density fluctuations exist in nonequilibrium systems of two or more dimensional @xcite .",
    "these long - range correlations are inconsistent with the extensive nature of thermodynamic fluctuation theory . in fact",
    ", we do not understand how the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite can be reconciled with the existence of long - range correlations .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "second , while we were able to numerically construct an extended free energy and confirm the validity of the extended linear response relations along the direction transverse to the external driving force , it seems more difficult to find similar relations along the direction parallel to the driving force .",
    "indeed , the study of a one - dimensional driven lattice gas far from equilibrium has revealed that the relationship between the fluctuations and the response to a probe force is complicated , because the fluctuations take the influence of hydrodynamic effects @xcite .    in order to construct a self - contained theory of nonequilibrium steady states , we need a unified treatment of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic fluctuations .",
    "for example , thinking optimistically , despite the existence of the long - range spatial correlations in nonequilibrium steady states , it might be possible to extract the thermodynamic component of the fluctuations by separating out of the long - range component . at present",
    ", however , there is no theory providing such a treatment .",
    "however , we should mention that the additivity principle proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite might provide a useful tool to study this problem , because this principle provides an elegant method by which the thermodynamic part of density fluctuations can be distinguished from the hydrodynamic part .",
    "although the validity of this principle has been confirmed only for certain exactly solvable nonequilibrium models , it would be interesting to consider its application to a wider class of nonequilibrium models and to study how thermodynamic fluctuations can be extracted by use of this additivity principle .    if we could construct a unified treatment of fluctuations for nonequilibrium steady sates far from equilibrium",
    ", our next step would be to seek new universal relations between fluctuations and response properties to probe forces in such systems . in that pursuit , and in the construction of a general theory of nonequilibrium steady states , the present paper ,",
    "in which we have elucidated the interrelations among the linear response relations , statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , should serve as a useful guide .",
    "the authors acknowledge t. harada , h. tasaki and a. yoshimori for fruitful discussions on linear response theory and nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "we also acknowledge g. paquette for helpful comments on the paper .",
