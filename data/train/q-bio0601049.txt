    "<S> we show that the unfolding times diverge on lowering the temperature and that below @xmath2 , the unfolding process runs in reverse to folding as monitored at an optimal folding temperature . </S>",
    "<S> some of our predictions regarding scenarious of the conformational changes are found to be consistent with experimental findings . </S>",

    "<S> the non - native contacts are described by repulsive cores of @xmath8  . </S>",
    "<S> the energy parameter , @xmath9 , is taken to be uniform and its effective value appears to be of order 900 k , at least for titin . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal folding temperature , @xmath10 , for i27 has been found to correspond to the reduced temperature @xmath11 of 0.275 @xcite ( @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath13 is temperature ) which is close to the room temperature value of @xmath14=0.3 . in our stretching simulations , </S>",
    "<S> both ends of the protein are attached to harmonic springs of elastic constant @xmath15=0.12 @xmath16@xmath17 which is close to the values corresponding to the elasticity of experimental cantilevers . </S>",
    "<S> the free end of one of the two springs is constrained while the free end of the second spring is pulled at constant speed , @xmath18 , along the initial end - to - end position vector . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on @xmath18 of 0.005 @xmath19 , where @xmath20ps is the characteristic time for the lennard - jones potentials . here </S>",

    "<S> the damping constant @xmath26 is taken to be equal to @xmath27 and the dispersion of the random forces is equal to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of @xmath26 corresponds to a situation in which the inertial effects are negligible @xcite but the damping action is not yet as strong as in water . </S>",
    "<S> increasing @xmath26 twentyfold results in a twentyfold increase in the time scales bringing the typical value of @xmath18 within two orders of magnitude of the experimental pulling speeds @xcite and correspondingly longer folding times @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion are solved by a fifth order predictor - corrector scheme . </S>",
    "<S> + the top two panels of figure 1 illustrate what happens to distances between two pairs of amino acids that make native contacts when submitting the i27 domain of titin to a very high reduced temperature of 1.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the broken line corresponds to the distance of 1.5@xmath5 that is considered as a qualitative treshold for the amino acids staying or not staying in a contact @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the treshold line is being crossed repeatedly due to thermal fluctuations . however , there is a well defined and pair - specific time @xmath29 at which the contact breaks for good , at least within the unfolding time , @xmath30 that is defined by the requirement that all non - local contacts are broken . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the non - locality refers to the sequencial distance @xmath31 , where @xmath32 ( non - helical ) . </S>",
    "<S> the example values of @xmath30 are indicated in the top panels of figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the unfolding scenarios may be defined in terms of a list of the times @xmath29 that are averaged over several hundred different trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> + the values of @xmath30 vary across the trajectories and we define @xmath33 as their median ( a simple average would be ill - defined if there was no unfolding within a cutoff duration in the time evolution ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lower left panel of figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath33 for three model proteins including the i27 domain of titin . on lowering the @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath33 grows rapidly , faster than according to the arrhenius law , suggesting perhaps a vogel - fulcher - like divergence at a finite @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a finite system such as a single protein can give rise to a divergence only at @xmath14=0 . </S>",
    "<S> this statement also applies to folding times which generally have a u - shaped temperature dependence with divergences at zero and infinity with the former being arrhenius - like @xcite ( mean field theories may lead to different conclusions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath33 appears to be consistent , to a leading order with the @xmath35 law . </S>",
    "<S> interpretation of this law , and corrections to it , remain to be elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> our data do not rule out a power law divergence either . </S>",
    "<S> + we have found that varying the parameter @xmath36 between 4 and 10 affects @xmath33 insignificantly . </S>",
    "<S> however reducing @xmath36 below 4 results in a substantially different @xmath33 as shown in the lower right panel of figure 1 for the 1bba protein for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a physical relevance of @xmath32 for distinguishing between local and non - local contacts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering @xmath36 smaller than 4 is impractical computationally for proteins that are bigger than 1bba , and appears to have no justification in the chemical denaturation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lower right panel of figure 1 shows that the divergence of the unfolding time also applies to secondary structures . in that theoretical case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath37 is a more sensible choice to take . </S>",
    "<S> + there are characteristic temperatures that are associated with the processes of folding and stretching . in the case of folding , it is the temperature of kinetic optimality ( 0.275 for 1tit ) . in the case of stretching , it is the temperature ( 0.8 for 1tit ) at which the purely entropic behavior @xcite sets in : above it , force peaks disappear and the system acquires the worm - like - chain behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> is there a characteristic temperature , @xmath2 that can be associated with thermal unfolding ? </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 suggests that there indeed such a temperature exists and its reduced value for titin is around 1.1 . </S>",
    "<S> below this temperature , the median and the most probable unfolding times diverge from each other significantly , indicating emergence of a broad distribution of time scales and temporal separation of the unfolding events . </S>",
    "<S> + the left top panel of figure 3 shows the average scenarios of the unfolding events in titin at two temperatures : at @xmath2 and substantially below it , i.e. , at @xmath14=0.85 . </S>",
    "<S> these scenarios show the average unfolding times , @xmath38 of specific contacts . </S>",
    "<S> these times are plotted against the contact order , i.e. , against the sequential distance @xmath39 . in order to see the details in the scenarios , we actually plot @xmath40 which removes the dominant time scale . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that at and above @xmath2 , the thermal fluctuations destroy bonds nearly simultaneously , independent of the contact order . on the other hand , below @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , the scenarios acquire reproducible structures in which the contacts between strands c and f ( solid squares ) and between strands a and g ( solid circles ) disintegrate much sooner , on an average , than those between strands b - e ( open triangles ) and b - g ( open circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> this order of events agrees with all - atom nanosecond long unfolding simulations of titin by paci and karplus @xcite in which several trajectories were studied at 450 k. + in broad features , the unfolding scenario at @xmath41 runs in reverse to the folding scenario at @xmath10 shown in the top right panel of figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cross correlation plot between the two scenarios , shown in the bottom left panel of figure 3 , indicates that the two processes are not simply unticorrelated but merely reflecting the time flow of events in a fairly monotonic fashion . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the events which are most relevant to the search of the transition state  the final stages of folding and the initial stages of unfolding  anticorrelate in a nearly linear way . </S>",
    "<S> this point qualitatively agrees with all - atom simulations for the @xmath42-hairpin fragment of protein g @xcite that were performed between certain characteristic sets of conformations ( 16 amino acids were considered , the unfolding simulations took place at 350 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the folding scenario shown in the top right panel of figure 3 is defined in terms of average times , @xmath43 , at which specific contacts are established for the first time @xcite . ( </S>",
    "<S> folding is considered to be fully accomplished when all contacts are simultaneously established for the first time ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that folding in the model titin takes place in two channels . in the first channel , comprising about 24% of the trajectories , the c - f contacts are established in twice as long a time as needed to set the a - g and a-g contacts . in the second channel , comprising the remaining 76% of the trajectories </S>",
    "<S> ( at the temperature of optimal folding ) , c - f gets established somewhat earlier than the a - g contacts . the scenario shown in figure 11 of reference </S>",
    "<S> @xcite combines the two channels . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario shown here discards the minority channel . </S>",
    "<S> our studies of a generalized model of titin , in which the c@xmath44 atoms are also included in the description of the model , agrees qualitatively with the majority - channel scenario . </S>",
    "<S> this updated scenario is consistent with the @xmath0-value data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + finaly , we consider mechanical stretching of 1tit at constant speed . </S>",
    "<S> its scenario is defined in terms of the last average distance , @xmath45 , at which contacts are still holding when the c - terminus is moving at a constant speed and the n - terminus is attached to an elastic anchor . we have already established that stretching at `` room temperature '' proceeds in a way that is unrelated to folding @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is only in the entropic limit , when stretching is governed exclusively by the sequential distance that stretching is approximately reverse to folding at optimality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the right bottom panel of figure 4 shows that when unfolding and stretching are both done at @xmath41 they follow each other in a monotonic way . </S>",
    "<S> the order of events is nearly identical but the time intervals between them do not scale linearly except perhaps at the very begining of the two processes . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced temperature of 0.85 belongs to the entropic regime but , at the same time , it is below @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of this panel shows , however , that stretching at at the `` room temperature '' value of @xmath14=0.3 does not correlate with unfolding at @xmath14=0.85 at all . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , we have provided an operational definition of the unfolding times , demonstrated their `` low''-temperature ( faster than arrhenius ) divergence and indicated existence of a characteristic temperature below which unfolding scenarios have contact - order - related structure and time scales become broadly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that long time folding events are anticorrelated with the short time unfolding events . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the simple topology - based dynamical models qualitatively capture what is known from experiments and simulations about the average order in which conformational changes proceed in titin . </S>"
