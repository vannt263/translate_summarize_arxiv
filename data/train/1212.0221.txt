    "the discovery of superconductivity at @xmath8 = 26 k in lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath3 has stimulated intensive efforts on searching for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperature , @xmath8 , and revealing their unconventional nature .",
    "@xcite until now , a few series of iron - based superconductors ( fescs ) have been discovered , with a maximum @xmath8 raised to 56 k when la is substituted by other rare - earth elements , e.g. , ce , sm , nd , pr and gd , in the @xmath17fe@xmath18o family ( @xmath17 = rare earth , @xmath18= pnictogen ) .",
    "@xcite the fescs show strong similarities to the copper oxides :  @xcite ( i ) both possess a layered crystal structure and a relative high @xmath8 ; ( ii ) superconductivity seems to be closely tied up with magnetism . on the other hand ,",
    "significant differences have been observed between them .",
    "for example , the parent compounds of fescs are bad metals , in contrast to the mott - insulators in the cuprates .",
    "@xcite the superconducting order parameter of fescs is supposed to be s@xmath19-type ,  @xcite while the cuprates are d - wave superconductors .",
    "@xcite moreover , the fescs show nearly isotropic upper critical fields at low temperature ,  @xcite but the cuprates are rather anisotropic .",
    "@xcite in these compounds , elemental substitutions have been shown to be an efficient approach to study superconductivity and its interplay with magnetism .    in @xmath17feaso ,",
    "superconductivity can be induced by doping either electrons or holes into the @xmath17o layers , as well as doping electrons into the feas layers . upon substituting fe with co , the magnetic / structural transition",
    "is quickly suppressed and superconductivity exists over a narrow doping range .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath17o layers , partial substitution of gd with th suppresses the magnetic / structural transition and then gives rise to superconductivity where @xmath8 reaches a maximum of 56 k at 20% th .",
    "@xcite similarly , a narrow superconducting region was also observed in gdfeaso@xmath20 by introducing oxygen deficiency .",
    "@xcite furthermore , o / f substitution in cefeaso also induces superconductivity with @xmath8 raised to 41 k.  @xcite    on the other hand , the rare - earth elements usually form an antiferromagnetically ordered state at very low temperatures .",
    "for instance , cefeaso sequentially undergoes two afm - type transitions upon cooling down from room temperature , one associated with fe ( @xmath21 150 k ) and the other one attributed to ce ( @xmath22 3.4 k ) .",
    "@xcite a similar situation happens in gdfeaso ( @xmath21 130 k , @xmath23 4.2 k ) .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , cefepo is a paramagnetic(pm ) heavy fermion metal .",
    "@xcite recent studies demonstrated that a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state of ce @xmath1 electrons , separating the afm state from the pm heavy fermion state , develops in the intermediate doping region in cefeas@xmath2p@xmath24o .",
    "@xcite moreover , the co - end compounds , namely @xmath17co@xmath18o , demonstrate rich magnetic properties attributed to the interactions between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons .",
    "for example , cecoaso and cecopo exhibit an enhanced sommerfeld coefficient of 200 mj / mol - k@xmath25 , and their co - ions undergo a fm transition at @xmath26 = 75 k.  @xcite lacoaso and lacopo are itinerant ferromagnets with a curie temperature of @xmath27 50 k and 60 k , respectively .",
    "@xcite complex magnetic properties were observed in smcoaso and ndcoaso , in which the co - ions first undergo a fm transition and then an afm transition upon cooling from room temperature ,  @xcite followed by an afm transition of the @xmath1 electrons at @xmath28 = 5 k and @xmath29 = 3.5 k.  @xcite in gdcoaso , both co and gd are magnetically ordered too ,  @xcite but there is no systematic study so far .",
    "these indicate that the 1111-type iron pnictides may provide us a rare system to study the interplay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons , and their emergent properties .",
    "a systematic study of the interplay between @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons would help elucidate the nature of superconductivity and magnetism in iron pnictides .    in this paper , we synthesize and measure the physical properties of cefe@xmath2co@xmath3aso and gdfe@xmath4co@xmath5aso ( @xmath30 ) , which represent two different cases of @xmath1 magnetic moments .",
    "a complete temperature - doping phase diagram is derived for each compound , showing remarkably rich physical properties tuned by @xmath0-@xmath1 interactions .",
    "the article is organized as follows : immediately after the introduction , we describe our experimental methods in section ii .",
    "section iiia characterizes the crystal structure of the compounds . in section iiib ,",
    "c and d , we present the experimental results of the electrical resistivity , magnetic properties and specific heat for cefe@xmath2co@xmath3aso and gdfe@xmath4co@xmath5aso , from which their phase diagrams are derived ( section iiie ) .",

    "high - purity ce ( 99.8@xmath35 ) , gd ( 99.9@xmath35 ) and as ( 99.999@xmath35 ) chunks , also co@xmath36o@xmath37 ( 99.97@xmath35 ) , fe@xmath38o@xmath36 ( 99.99@xmath35 ) , fe ( 99.9@xmath35 ) and co ( 99.9@xmath35 ) powders were used as raw materials . in the following ,",
    "we describe the methods of synthesizing the cefe@xmath2co@xmath24aso compounds ; the same holds for the gd - compounds .",
    "dehydrated co@xmath36o@xmath37 and fe@xmath38o@xmath36 were prepared by heating the powders at 1173 k for 10 h. first , ceas precursor was prepared by heating the mixture in a sealed evacuated quartz ampoule at 1073 k for 24 h , and then at 1323 k for 48 h. then , ceas , co@xmath36o@xmath37 , fe@xmath38o@xmath36 , fe and co powders were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio , thoroughly ground , and pressed into pellets . the entire process was carried out in an argon - filled glove box .",
    "finally , the pellets were placed in alumina crucibles , sealed into evacuated quartz ampoules , and then slowly heated to 1323 k at a rate of 100 k / h and annealed at this temperature for one week to obtain sintered pellets .",
    "the structure of these polycrystalline samples was characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) at room temperature using a panalytical xpert mrd diffractometer with cu k@xmath39 radiation and a graphite monochromator .",

    "all the peaks can be well indexed based on the tetragonal zrcusias structure with a space group of p4/nmm .",
    "no obvious impurity phases are detected , indicating high quality of these samples .",
    "the shift of the ( * 102 * ) peak toward the right ( larger @xmath40 value ) with increasing co concentration , as shown in the right inset of fig.1(a ) , reveals a contraction of the crystal lattice with increasing co - concentration .",
    "the lattice parameters , refined by the least square fitting , are plotted as a function of nominal co - concentration in fig.1(b ) and fig.1(c ) for cefe@xmath2co@xmath24aso and gdfe@xmath4co@xmath33aso , respectively .",
    "different from cefeas@xmath2p@xmath24o where both the @xmath41- and @xmath42-axis shrink with increasing p - content ,  @xcite in cefe@xmath2co@xmath24aso and gdfe@xmath4co@xmath33aso , the @xmath42-axis shrinks significantly while the @xmath41-axis increases slightly with increasing co concentration , meaning that fe / co substitution increases three dimensionality in comparison with as / p substitution .",
    "this becomes more pronounced for @xmath43 ( ce ) and @xmath44 ( gd ) , in which regime co - electrons order ferromagnetically at low temperatures .",
    "the shrinkage of the @xmath42-axis reduces the distance between the ceo(gdo ) and feas / coas layers , and thus enhances the hybridizations and magnetic exchange interactions between @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons .",
    "the inset of fig.1(b ) and fig.1(c ) shows the unit cell volume and the @xmath32 ratio versus co concentration , both of which monotonically decrease with increasing co content .",

    "@xcite upon partially substituting fe with co , the transition at @xmath52 is quickly suppressed and becomes hardly visible above @xmath53 .",
    "meanwhile , superconductivity appears around @xmath54 , and the transition temperature reaches a maximum of @xmath55 13.5 k at @xmath56 [ see the inset of fig.2(a ) ] .",
    "note that , for @xmath57 , no signature of a magnetic transition can be identified below @xmath8 in the electrical resistivity .",
    "this is different from that of cefeaso@xmath2f@xmath24 in which a non - zero resistive transition shows up below @xmath8 attributed to the magnetic order of ce .",
    "@xcite however , evidence for the afm transition of ce can be inferred from the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat ( see below ) . in comparison with cefeaso@xmath2f@xmath24 ,  @xcite",
    "another difference is the low - temperature semiconducting behavior observed in the underdoped cefe@xmath2co@xmath24aso ( @xmath58 ) , which may originate from a disorder effect or kondo - like scattering .",
    "the tiny amount of co atoms in the materials may act as magnetic impurities , leading to a resistive minimum as a result of the kondo effect .",
    "the system eventually becomes metallic with further increasing co concentration .",
    "figure 2(b ) presents the normalized electrical resistivity for @xmath59 , which decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature . in this doping region ,",

    ", the electrical resistivity demonstrates stronger temperature dependence with a broad hump around 100 k , likely attributed to the enhanced @xmath0-@xmath1 hybridizations as typically found in some kondo lattice compounds .",
    "@xcite upon further co - doping , the low - temperature plateau , observed for @xmath59 , persists as a change in slope as clearly shown in the derivatives of the electrical resistivity with respect to temperature , @xmath60 , in the inset of fig.2(c ) .",
    "one peak corresponds to the fm transition of co ( @xmath26 ) and the other , to the afm order of ce ( @xmath12 ) , both shifting to higher temperature with further increasing co concentration .",

    "observations of a @xmath115-type anomaly in specific heat and a cusp in magnetic susceptibility unambiguously identify the afm transition of gd around @xmath148 k. with increasing the co content , a second anomaly develops in the heat capacity at lower temperature for @xmath149 , but disappears again at @xmath11 .",
    "similar evidence can be also inferred from the magnetic susceptibility @xmath101 , which is most clearly seen in @xmath121 . as already described above , the second transition was also observed in the electrical resistivity [ see fig.3(b ) ] .",
    "all these indicate that the system ( @xmath15 ) may undergo a magnetic reorientation transition below @xmath16 attributed to the coupling between the co @xmath0 and gd @xmath1 electrons .",

    "ce @xmath1 electrons undergo an afm transition in the entire doping - range ( marked by afm@xmath154 ) ; the nel temperature @xmath12 slightly increases with suppressing the sdw transition of fe and then remains nearly unchanged up to @xmath155 . with further increasing co -",
    "content ( @xmath156 ) , the co @xmath0 electrons form long range fm order , the curie temperature of which eventually increases with @xmath48 , reaching @xmath157 k in cecoaso ( marked by fm@xmath158 ) . on the co - rich side , the co - ferromagnetism has a strong polarization effect on the afm order of ce ( marked by po ) .",
    "gdfeaso is also a bad metal , with the fe @xmath0 and gd @xmath1 electrons ordered antiferromagnetically below 130 k and 4 k , respectively .",
    "the fe - sdw transition vanishes around @xmath70 and superconductivity appears in a range of @xmath7 . at lower temperatures ,",
    "gd is antiferromagnetically ordered with @xmath16 @xmath78 4 k ( marked by afm@xmath159 ) , being nearly independent of the fe / co substitution .",
    "meanwhile , long range fm order of co @xmath0 electrons develops above @xmath160 , with the transition temperature reaching 75 k in gdcoaso .",
    "unlike cecoaso , however , gdcoaso shows ferrimagnetic behavior , with clear evidence that the gd moments oppose that of co , leading to a strong suppression of the magnetization at low temperatures .",
    "moreover , for @xmath161 , it appears that a magnetic reorientation transition occurs below @xmath16 , as noted by @xmath162 in fig.15(b ) .    as shown above , the 1111-type iron pnictides exhibit remarkably rich magnetic and superconducting properties via elemental substitutions .",
    "different from cefe@xmath2co@xmath24aso and gdfe@xmath4co@xmath33aso , superconductivity was only observed around @xmath163 in cefeas@xmath2p@xmath24o , which seems to coexist with ferromagnetism of ce below 4 k.  @xcite the magnetic order of ce persists up to @xmath164 in cefeas@xmath2p@xmath24o , but it changes from an afm- to a fm - type order while the sdw transition of fe is suppressed around @xmath165 0.3 .",
    "@xcite in contrast , the afm order of ce - ions is remarkably robust against fe / co substitution .",
    "its ordering temperature @xmath12 increases with @xmath48 while suppressing the sdw transition of fe , followed by a nearly unchanged value .",
    "the persistence of the ce - afm order , with a slight dependence of @xmath12 on co - doping , seems to contradict the kondo physics , which effect would be enhanced when the interlayer distance is compressed by the fe / co substitution as evidenced from the enhancement of the sommerfeld coefficient in cecoaso ( @xmath142 @xmath166 200 mj / mol - k@xmath25 ) .",
    "@xcite this is possibly due to the polarization of co - atoms caused by spin - orbit coupling which competes with the kondo effect .",
    "the resulting afm exchange interaction between co @xmath0 and ce @xmath1 electrons is thus anisotropic in the spin space .",
    "the multi - orbital characteristics may also add complications to the interplay among various intralayer and interlayer exchange interactions , leading to diverse behavior in the @xmath0-@xmath167 electron pnictides .",
    "for example , in other @xmath17co@xmath18o systems , e.g. , re = nd and sm,@xcite the interlayer @xmath168-@xmath169 exchange interaction is strong enough to realign the co moments , leading to a subsequent afm transition of co at a lower temperature .",
    "such transitions and magnetic structures have recently been proposed from neutron scattering in ndcoaso.@xcite however , in cefe@xmath2co@xmath24aso , ce - ions carry a small magnetic moment and the material shows a relatively weak lattice shrinkage along the @xmath42-axis upon substituting fe with co ; the resulting afm exchange interaction is likely not sufficiently strong to realign the co moments . instead ,",
    "the ce moments are partially polarized by the internal field of co. however , the large moment of gd in gdfe@xmath4co@xmath33aso is robust against the fm order of co. the coupling between the gd and co lattices leads to ferrimagnetic behavior and also possible magnetic reorientation of co at low temperatures . since the fm order of co is generally observed in the @xmath17coaso families ,  @xcite it is desirable to extend such measurements to other series , to study the interplay of @xmath1 and @xmath0 electrons and its influence on superconductivity and magnetism in iron pnictides .",
    "further investigations on the co - rich side is highly important in order to clarify the magnetic structures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons in these systems .",
    "in summary , we have systematically studied the transport , magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the polycrystalline samples cefe@xmath2co@xmath24aso and gdfe@xmath4co@xmath33aso ( @xmath30 ) and presented a complete doping - temperature phase diagram . it is found that both ce- and gd - compounds exhibit similar behavior on the fe - side , but rather distinct properties on the co - side . on the fe - rich side , superconductivity occurs upon suppressing the sdw transition of fe . at lower temperatures , the rare - earth elements ( ce and gd )",
    "undergo an afm - type magnetic transition , whose temperature is slightly increased while suppressing the sdw - transition of fe , but then becomes nearly unchanged over a wide doping regime . on the co - rich side , co electrons form a long - range fm order , the transition temperature of which increases with increasing co content and reaches @xmath170 75 k in cecoaso and gdcoaso .",
    "evidence of a strong polarization effect of the co - ferromagnetism on ce atoms is observed on the co - rich side .",
    "but the gd is rather robust against fe / co substitution ; it is hardly polarized even in the case that co - ions are ferromagnetically ordered . however , the coupling between gd- and co - species gives rise to ferrimagnetic behavior on the co - side , which can be well described in terms of a mean field model that considers weak afm coupling between the gd - species and the co - species .",
    "our findings suggest that , the delicate interplay of @xmath0-@xmath1 electrons rising from the competition of electron hybridizations and magnetic exchange coupling leads to remarkably rich physics in the iron pnictides .",
