    "the transverse momentum fluctuations in proton - proton and central pb - pb collisions at 158 gev per nucleon have been recently measured @xcite on event - by - event basis . to eliminate trivial ` geometrical ' fluctuations due to the impact parameter variation the so - called @xmath1measure @xcite has been used .",
    "@xmath4 is constructed is such a way that it is exactly the same for nucleon - nucleon ( n - n ) and nucleus - nucleus ( a - a ) collisions if the a - a collision is a simple superposition of n - n interactions .",
    "consequently , @xmath4 is independent of the centrality of a - a collision in such a case . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath4 equals zero when the inter - particle correlations are entirely absent .",
    "the critical analysis of the @xmath1measure can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the central pb - pb collisions , the value of @xmath5 measured in the laboratory rapidity window ( 4.0 , 5.5 ) equals @xmath6 mev @xcite .",
    "the preliminary result for proton - proton interactions in the same acceptance is @xmath7 mev @xcite .",
    "although the two values are close to each other the mechanisms behind them seem to be very different .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the correlations , which are of the short range in the momentum space as those due to the bose - einstein statistics , are responsible for the positive value of @xmath5 in the central pb - pb collisions . when the short range correlations are excluded @xmath5 is reduced to @xmath8 mev @xcite our calculations have indeed demonstrated @xcite that the effect of bose statistics of pions modified by the hadron resonances fully explains the observed @xmath5 in the central pb - pb collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "the short range correlations have been experimentally shown @xcite to provide a negligible contribution to the @xmath0fluctuations in the p - p interactions .",
    "thus , the data suggest that the dynamical long range correlations are reduced in the central pb - pb collisions ( when compared to p - p ) with the short range due to the bose statistics being amplified . the former feature is a natural consequence of the system evolution towards the thermodynamic equilibrium . the amplification of the quantum statistics effect results from the increased particle population in the final state phase - space .",
    "since various dynamical correlations contribute to @xmath5 the question emerges what is the dynamical correlation in the nucleon - nucleon interactions which appear to be washed out in the central nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss the question .",
    "the average transverse momentum @xmath9 , which is measured at a given multiplicity @xmath10 , is known to depend on @xmath10 in proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the correlation is negative for the collision energies below , say , @xmath11 gev and positive for the higher energies . at the beam energy of 205 gev ( @xmath12 gev ) , which is very close to that of the na49 measurement @xcite",
    ", @xmath9 significantly decreases with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the data are shown in fig .  1 , where we have merged the results for positive and negative particles .",
    "as already discussed in @xcite , the correlation which couples @xmath9 to @xmath10 leads to @xmath13 . here , we compute @xmath5 as a function of the correlation strength .",
    "analytical and numerical results are presented .",
    "the effect of the finite acceptance is studied and comparison with the experimental data is performed .",
    "let us first introduce the @xmath1measure .",
    "one defines the single - particle variable @xmath14 with the overline denoting averaging over a single particle inclusive distribution . here",
    ", we identify @xmath15 with the particle transverse momentum . the event variable @xmath16 , which is a multiparticle analog of @xmath17 ,",
    "is defined as @xmath18 , where the summation runs over particles from a given event . by construction , @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents averaging over events .",
    "finally , the @xmath1measure is defined in the following way @xmath21    the correlation @xmath9 _ vs. _ @xmath10 is introduced to our model calculations through the multiplicity dependent temperature or slope parameter of @xmath0distribution . specifically , the single particle transverse momentum distribution in the events of multiplicity @xmath10 is chosen in the form suggested by the thermal model i.e. @xmath22 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the particle mass while @xmath24 is the multiplicity dependent temperature defined as @xmath25 with @xmath26 controlling the correlation strength . for @xmath27 one",
    "gets @xmath28 . the inclusive transverse momentum distribution , which determines @xmath29 , reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the multiplicity distribution .    the @xmath32particle transverse momentum distribution in the events of multiplicity @xmath10 is assumed to be the @xmath32product of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , all inter - particle correlations different than @xmath9 _ vs. _ @xmath10 are entirely neglected",
    ". then , one easily finds @xmath34    assuming that the particles are massless and the correlation is weak i.e. @xmath35 the calculation of @xmath4 can be performed analytically .",
    "the results read : @xmath36 \\nonumber \\overline{z^2 } & = & 2 t^2   - 4 { t \\delta \\ !",
    "\\langle n \\rangle }   \\big(\\langle n^2 \\rangle - \\langle n \\rangle^2 \\big ) \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & & \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; + 2{\\delta \\ !",
    "\\langle n \\rangle^2 }   \\big(3 \\langle n^3 \\rangle \\langle n \\rangle      -2 \\langle n^2 \\rangle \\langle n \\rangle^2      +   \\langle n \\rangle^4       -2",

    "one observes that the lowest non - vanishing contribution to @xmath4 is of the second order in @xmath26 .",
    "the above formulas are much simplified for the poisson multiplicity distribution .",
    "then , one finds @xmath37 \\overline{z^2 } & = & 2 t^2 - 4 t \\delta \\ !",
    "t   + 2\\delta \\ !",
    "t^2 \\big(3 \\langle n \\rangle + 1 \\big)\\ ; ,   \\\\[3 mm ] \\phi(p_t ) & = & \\sqrt{2 } \\ , { \\delta \\ !",
    "\\over t }   \\big ( \\langle n \\rangle^2 + \\langle n \\rangle \\big ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the multiplicity distribution of charged particles produced in high energy proton - proton collisions is , of course , not poissonian .",
    "first of all , the number of charged particles is always even due to the charge conservation .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of positive ( or negative ) particles is also not poissonian - the dispersion does not grow as @xmath38 but it follows the so - called wrblewski formula @xcite _ i.e. _ the dispersion is the linear function of @xmath39 .",
    "however , for the average multiplicities as low as those discussed here the poisson distribution provides a reasonable approximation .",
    "therefore , the multiplicity distribution , which is further used in our calculation , is poissonian for negative pions with the number of positive pions being exactly equal to that of negative charge . thus , the charge conservation is satisfied in every event .",
    "for such a multiplicity distribution @xmath3 , which is given by approximate eq .",
    "( [ massless - phi ] ) , reads @xmath40",
    "the results from the previous section are instructive but the adopted approximations are very rough .",
    "so , let us present more realistic monte carlo calculations which can be confronted with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the proton - proton collisions are simulated event by event in the following way . for",
    "every event we first generate the multiplicity of negative particles from the poisson distribution and then add the equal number of positive particles .",
    "the average multiplicity of negative particles has been taken as @xmath41 which is the experimentally observed negative multiplicity in non - diffractive proton - proton interactions at 205 gev @xcite .",
    "this is the collision energy corresponding to the data from fig .  1 .",
    "further , we attribute the transverse momentum from the distribution ( [ pt - dis ] ) to each particle assuming that all particles are pions .",
    "the numerical values of the temperature and correlation strength have been found fitting the data @xcite shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we have got @xmath42 mev and @xmath43 for charged particle multiplicity @xmath44 .    due to the particle registration inefficiency and finite detector coverage of the final state phase - space , only a fraction of particles produced in high - energy collisions is usually observed the experimental studies . as an input to our model calculations we have taken",
    "the @xmath45 correlation observed in the full phase - space .",
    "the rapidity , which determines the acceptance domain , is not considered at all . therefore , there is no difference whether a particle is lost due to the limited acceptance or due to the tracking inefficiency .",
    "our monte carlo simulation takes into account the two effects in such a way that each generated particle - positive or negative pion - is registered with the probability @xmath46 and rejected with @xmath47 .",
    "below , we further discuss the procedure in the context of na49 data @xcite .",
    "the results of our simulation are collected in fig .  2 where @xmath3 as a function of @xmath26 for several values of @xmath46 is shown .",
    "we have checked that our simulation fully reproduces the results from @xcite , where only negative particles in the full acceptance have been studied .    as seen in fig .  2 , @xmath3 grows quadratically with @xmath26 in agreement with the approximate equation ( [ analytic - phi ] ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath3 with @xmath46 also follows from eq .",
    "( [ analytic - phi ] ) .",
    "indeed , when a particle is detected with the probability @xmath46 the temperature dispersion effectively decreases and the multiplicity @xmath39 should be replaced by @xmath48 in ( [ analytic - phi ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath3 grows quadratically with the observed particle multiplicity and the correlation , which is easily observable in the full phase - space , is hardly seen in the acceptance as small as 20% .",
    "this behavior is very different than that found in refs .",
    "@xcite where @xmath3 due to the bose - einstein correlations has been computed .",
    "then , @xmath3 is independent of the particle multiplicity .",
    "the na49 measurement of @xmath3 in proton - proton collisions has been performed in the transverse momentum and pion rapidity intervals ( 0.005 , 1.5 ) gev and ( 4.0 , 5.5 ) , respectively @xcite . only about 20% of all produced particles have been observed .",
    "our simulation gives @xmath49 mev for the values of @xmath50 mev and @xmath51 which are adequate for the na49 measurement .",
    "thus , the theoretical result significantly underestimates the preliminary experimental one which is , as already noted , @xmath52 mev @xcite .",
    "one wonders whether the discrepancy is not caused by our highly simplified procedure of taking into account the effect of finite acceptance .",
    "we first note that the rapidity coverage of the na49 measurement which is ( 4.0 , 5.5 ) in the laboratory translates into ( 1.1 , 2.6 ) in the center of mass frame . therefore , the observed pions are not far the very central rapidity region .",
    "since most of pions originates from the domain the average characteristics of all pions and that of the central ones are expected to be similar to each other . indeed ,",
    "the data from @xcite show that @xmath9 for all pions and those from the central region are essentially the same .",
    "therefore , the correlation strength parameter @xmath53 mev , which corresponds to the @xmath45 correlation averaged over full phase - space , seem to be applicable not only to all pions but to the central ones as well .",
    "one further notes that @xmath9 shown in @xcite changes with the rapidity similarly for different @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the correlation @xmath9 _ vs. _ @xmath10 only weakly varies with @xmath54 and it is hard to expect that the correlation strength observed in the na49 acceptance domain is significantly larger than that averaged over the whole phase - space .",
    "the data @xcite suggests rather the opposite effect .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our simplified procedure can not distort the results dramatically and that the correlation @xmath9 _ vs. _ @xmath10 does not explain the na49 p - p preliminary data .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath4 is constructed is such a way that it is exactly the same for nucleon - nucleon and nucleus - nucleus collisions if the latter is a simple superposition of former ones .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 shown in fig .",
    "2 holds for nucleus - nucleus when all secondary interactions are neglected . since our model neglects the bose - einstein correlations it can be compared with the na49 data for the central pb - pb collisions when the short range correlations are excluded . in such a case ,",
    "our result @xmath55 mev for @xmath50 mev and @xmath51 appears to be compatible with the experimental value @xmath56 mev @xcite .",
    "the smallness of @xmath3 reported by na49 collaboration is then not surprising at all . as follows from fig .  2 it is caused by the limited acceptance .",
    "however , it is premature to draw a conclusion about @xmath0correlations in pb - pb collisions until the origin of @xmath3 p - p interactions is not explained .",
    "we have studied how the correlation , which couples the average @xmath2 to the event multiplicity , influences the transverse momentum fluctuations observed by means of the @xmath1measure .",
    "the approximate analytical formula has been derived and then the numerical simulation has been performed .",
    "the effect of the finite detector acceptance has been taken into account .",
    "the procedure is highly simplified but it seems to be adequate for the na49 data .",
    "it has been shown that the effect of the correlation @xmath9 _ vs. _ @xmath10 is very weak if the particles from the small acceptance region are studied .",
    "consequently , the correlation is far too weak to explain the preliminary experimental value of @xmath3 in proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "if the preliminary data is confirmed by the final analysis one should look for other sources of dynamical @xmath0fluctuations .",
    "the effect of the conservation laws presumably plays no role in the acceptance as small as 20% .",
    "the decays of hadron resonances which strongly correlate the momenta of decay products might be important . however , the hadron resonances are present in proton - proton and nucleus - nucleus collisions as well .",
    "consequently , the reported reduction of long range dynamical correlations in the central pb - pb collisions when compared to p - p @xcite remains unexplained .",
    "the situation is much simpler if preliminary data on @xmath3 in proton - proton collision @xcite overestimates the real value .",
    "then , @xmath3 from p - p and central pb - pb are close to each other .",
    "there is also no conflict between our calculations and the experimental data .",
    "however , one can not conclude that the long range correlations present in the proton - proton interactions are washed out in the central heavy - ion collisions the problem obviously needs further experimental and theoretical studies . in particular , the data on proton - proton and nucleus - nucleus collisions from the enlarged acceptance are needed ."
