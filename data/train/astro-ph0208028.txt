    "usually the evaluation of reliability of claimed ns / snr associations is based on the use of five criteria formulated by @xcite , which come to the following questions : +  do independent distance estimates agree ?",
    "+  do independent age estimates agree ?",
    "+  is the implied transverse velocity reasonable ? +  is there evidense for any interaction between the ns and snr ?",
    "+  does the proper motion vector of the ns point away from the snr center ? + the last question is considered the most important one since  a proper motion measurement has the potential to disprove an association regardless of the answers to the other questions \" ( @xcite ) .",
    "sometimes a claimed ns / snr association is considered as false on the basis of statistical studies of associations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , one of the arguments against the association of psr with the snr ( @xcite ) is based on the suggestion by @xcite that young ( @xmath0 yr ) nss can not overrun their parent snr shells .    however , these approaches neglect two very important effects : the modification of the ambient medium by the ionizing emission and stellar wind of massive stars ( the progenitors of most of sne ) , and the proper motion of sn progenitor stars .",
    "the first effect is important since it is the subsequent interaction of sn blast waves with their processed ambient medium ( a system of cavities and shells ) that results in the observed snrs : their structure and evolution are already known to deviate significantly from those derived from standard models of snrs based on the sedov - taylor solution ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar proper motion should be considered since it could result ( @xcite and references therein ) in a considerable offset of the sn explosion site from the center of the wind - driven bubble ( i.e. from the geometrical center of the future snr ) .",
    "taking into account these two effects could significantly affect the results of previous studies of ns / snr associations , and allow us to enlarge the circle of possible ns / snr associations and to search for new associations .",
    "we now discuss the criteria for evaluating the reliability of ns / snr associations proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the first two criteria should be undoubtedly fulfilled for any proposed association .",
    "but the application of the third and fifth ones for evaluating of proposed associations is not so straightforward , since they are based on the assumption that the sn explosion site coincides with the geometrical center of the snr .",
    "this assumption , however , could be erroneous in the case of a density - stratified interstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ) or in the case of an off - centered cavity sn explosion ( @xcite and references therein ) . in both cases the velocity estimates implied by angular displacements of nss from the geometrical centers of associated snrs could be significantly in error , while the associations rejected on the basis of high implied transverse velocities of nss [ e.g. /snr ( @xcite ) or psr /snr ( @xcite ) ] could be genuine .",
    "it is clear that the proper motion vector of a ns born in an off - centered cavity sn explosion could be oriented arbitrarily with respect to the geometrical center of the associated snr .",
    "therefore one can naturally explain why the tails behind a number of nss [ e.g. psr ( @xcite ; see also sect .",
    "3.2 ) or a compact x - ray source in the snr ( @xcite ) ] do not point towards the centers of their parent shells . in principle , the proper motion vector of a ns even could be directed to the center of the snr ( just this situation takes place in the case of psr , which is located within the snr ; see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is not impossible that a ns born far from the center of the former wind - driven bubble ( now the center of the snr ) will reach it after a while ( a possible example : the 24000 yr old psr located close to the center of the nearly circular snr ; see @xcite ) . from this",
    "follows that the age of a ns inferred from the ns displacement from the geometrical center of the associated snr could be considerably underestimated ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the fourth criterion should be applied for those claimed associations , where the ns is located not far ( at least in projection ) from the snr s shell , e.g. in the case of psr , which is superposed on the arc - like  shell \" of the snr .",
    "one of the arguments against the association between these objects is the absence of any signs of interaction between the pulsar and the snr s shell ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but the apparent location of a ns on the edge of snr s shell simply could be due to the effect of projection in nonspherically - symmetric snrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "sometimes the high implied transverse velocities of nss are used to discard the possible ns / snr associations . for example",
    ", @xcite suggested ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the lack of a pulsar wind radio nebula around psr means that the maximum space velocity of this pulsar is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the distance to the pulsar in units of 5 kpc , and therefore it could not be associated with the nearby snr since this association implies the transverse velocity of the pulsar of @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the implied velocity , however , could be reduced two times simply due to the possible off - centered cavity sn explosion , and once again two or even more times if the braking index of the pulsar is similar , respectively , to that of psr ( @xmath4 ) or the ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the high transverse velocity also was inferred for psr , which lies well outside the shell of the snr ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the physical association of these two objects was firmly established after the discovery ( e.g. @xcite ) of a tail of radio emission connecting the pulsar with the snr .",
    "however , the pulsar psr is more interesting in that its proper motion vector does not point away from the geometrical center of the snr ( @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that the snr is the result of an off - centered sn explosion in the preexisting wind - driven bubble surrounded by a massive shell .",
    "the mass of the shell is a very important parameter since it determines the evolution of the snr : if the mass of the shell is @xmath6 times the mass of the sn ejecta , the sn blast wave merges with the shell ( e.g. @xcite ) and evolves into a momentum - conserving stage ( i.e. propagates with a velocity @xmath7 ) . in this case ,",
    "even a young ns moving with a moderate velocity ( @xmath8 ) is able to overrun the snr s shell ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , provided that it was born not far from the edge of the wind - driven bubble .",
    "our suggestion allows to reduce considerably the transverse velocity of the pulsar and naturally explains why the tail behind the pulsar does not point back to the center of the snr .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite who provide some arguments in support of this association in details .",
    "a concept of an off - centered cavity sn explosion could be used to explain the peculiar structure of a number of snrs and thereby to infer the  true \" sn explosion sites in these snrs .",
    "the later , in its turn , could be used for searches for stellar remnants possible associated with these snrs .",
    "we suggest that the snr is the result of a cavity sn explosion of a moving massive star ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which ends its evolution just near the edge of the main - sequence ( ms ) bubble .",
    "we also suggest that the bright protrusion in the southwest half of the snr is the recently shocked dense material of a bow shock - like structure generated by the moving sn progenitor star during the red supergiant ( rsg ) phase [ we interpret a clumpy optical arc of radius of @xmath9 pc located interior to the x - ray and radio outlines of the protrusion ( see , e.g. , fig . 2 of @xcite ) as the remnant of this structure ] , while the remainder of the snr is due to the interaction of the sn blast wave with the wall of the adjacent ms bubble . for the snr s age of few times @xmath10 yr ( i.e. the time required for the sn blast wave to cross the ms bubble of diameter of @xmath11 pc ) and provided that the ns was born with the velocity of @xmath12 , one can propose that the stellar remnant should be still within the region bounded by the optical arc . to check this proposal we analysed the archival _ rosat _ data , but the limited photon statistics and the moderate spatial resolution of the _ rosat _ pspc did not allowed the detection of a possible compact x - ray source against the bright background emission of the snr s shell .",
    "the analysis of the _ chandra _ data ( which shortly will be publicly available ) would be highly desirable .",
    "a massive star moving with a sufficiently large velocity ( @xmath13 ) crosses the ms bubble and during the rsg phase moves mainly through the unperturbed interstellar medium .",
    "the slow , dense wind losing during the rsg phase assumes the form of an elongated tail stretched behind the moving star .",
    "this asymmetric and massive ( @xmath14 ) circumstellar structure could survive the passage of the sn blast wave and will appear as a  spoke \" of thermal x - ray emission joining the sn explosion site to the circular shell of the young ( few times @xmath10 yr ) snr .",
    "we suggest that just this situation takes place in the case of the snr and interpret a prominent curl on the south end of the  spoke \" ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) as the recently shocked wall of the  hollow \" tail produced by the moving sn progenitor star .",
    "in the above two examples we assumed that the sn explodes just after the rsg phase , that is that the zero age ms mass of the sn progenitor star was @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ) . if , however , the progenitor star is more massive , then after the rsg phase it evolves through the wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase .",
    "the existence of this additional evolutionary phase could have some important consequences .",
    "one of them is discussed below .",
    "we propose that the sn explosion sites in some middle - aged ( shell - like ) snrs could be marked by nebulae of thermal x - ray emission and that this emission could be responsible for the centrally - peaked x - ray appearance of some ( so - called mixed - morphology ; @xcite ) snrs .",
    "our proposal is based on the following simple arguments ( see also @xcite ) .    a massive star , before it explodes as a sn , loses during the rsg phase a considerable fraction ( @xmath16 ) of its initial mass in the form of a slow , dense wind , which occupies a region of radius a few pc .",
    "the subsequent interaction of the fast wr wind with the slow rsg wind results in the origin of dense clumps , radially moving with velocities of @xmath17 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . after the sn explodes ,",
    "the sn blast wave propagates through the tenuous interclump medium , leaving behind the dense clumps embedded in the hot shocked interclump gas .",
    "the gradual evaporation of the material of radially moving clumps results in the origin of an expanding nebula of thermal x - ray emission , which is centered on the sn explosion site .",
    "the snr consists of two circular radio shells with the centrally - filled thermal x - ray emission peaked on the region where the radio shells overlap each other ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that this snr is the result of a sn explosion inside the large - scale wr bubble adjacent to the ms bubble ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also suggest that the ( thermal ) x - ray emission comes from the hot gas evaporated from the dense circumstellar clumps ( see above ) and that the x - ray peak coincides with the sn explosion site .",
    "note that the mass of x - ray emitting material is @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath19 is the distance to the snr in units of 2.3 kpc ( @xcite ) , whereas the expected mass of circumstellar gas ( i.e. the mass lost during the rsg phase ) is @xmath20 .",
    "the snr consists of an elongated radio shell and a central nebula of thermal x - ray emission .",
    "the unabsorbed 0.5 - 10.0 kev flux from the snr is @xmath21 ( @xcite ) , that at a distance of 7 kpc corresponds to a luminosity @xmath22 .",
    "we suggest that the sn explodes far from the ms bubble , but inside the large - scale wr bubble ( surrounded by a massive shell ; see below ) .",
    "to estimate the mass of x - ray emitting gas , @xmath23 , we assume that most of the observed x - ray flux comes from the bright central nebula of radius @xmath24 pc .",
    "then assuming that the gas is homogeneously distributed over the whole volume of the nebula , one has @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cooling function for temperatures between @xmath27 k and @xmath28 k ( e.g. @xcite ) , and @xmath29 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . for @xmath30",
    "k ( @xcite ) , one has @xmath31 , that is a quite reasonable value if the initial mass of the sn progenitor star was @xmath32 ( in this case the progenitor star ends its evolution as a wr star ) .",
    "we note that the size and the general appearance of the snr [ elongated shell , roughly parallel to the galactic plane ; bright optical emission on either side from the major axis of the snr ( e.g. @xcite ) ] suggest that the sn explosion occurs inside a cavity surrounded by a massive ( barrel - like ) shell swept - up by the fast wr wind .",
    "the large - scale interstellar magnetic field ( at low latitudes parallel to the plane of the galaxy ) accumulated in the wind - driven shell reduces the column density near the magnetic poles of the shell ( @xcite ) , that leads to the elongated shape of the resulting snr and could be responsible for the bilateral distribution of the optical emission along the snr s shell ( the sn blast wave becomes radiative primarily near the magnetic equator , where the column density is maximum ; cf .",
