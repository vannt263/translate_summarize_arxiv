    "the 7-s pulsar , , was discovered during an automatic search of the _ asca _  archival data ( gotthelf & vasisht 1998 ; torii  1998 ) . based on its spectral and timing properties ,  is likely the latest addition to the class of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) ( duncan & thomson 1996 ; mereghetti & stella 1995 ; van paradijs 1995 ) .",
    "evidence included a long rotation period , large modulation ( @xmath0 ) , steady short - term x - ray flux during the original _ asca _  observation , steep characteristic spectrum ( power - law photon index @xmath1 ) , location at low galactic latitude , and the lack of known counterpart . a rough distance estimate derived from the x - ray absorption places the pulsar at distance of @xmath2 kpc giving an inferred x - ray luminosity of order @xmath3 erg s@xmath4",
    ".    herein we report on new _ asca _  x - ray and vla radio observations directed at the pulsar s location .",
    "our goal was to identify the pulsar and confirm or repudiate the axp hypothesis by measuring the spin - down rate of the pulsar and searching for an associated radio supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "we succeeded in finding a young radio snr within the pulsar s error circle , however the pulsator was not seen again .",
    "instead , we find a faint asca point source ( vasisht 2000 ) at the center of the newly discovered radio snr  ( gaensler  1999 ) .",
    "we argue that this faint source is the pulsar  in a low state ; we consider the pulsar s location at the center of a young snr and the lack of a radio counterpart as evidence for the axp interpretation , but with a twist .",
    "we revisited the field containing the pulsar  with the _ asca_observatory on march 28 - 29 , 1999 ut .",
    "figure 1 reproduced the smoothed and exposure corrected image taken with the gas imaging spectrometers ( giss ) aboard _",
    "asca_. the gis is sensitive to photon in the @xmath5 kev energy range and has a spatial resolution @xmath6 .",
    "all data were edited following the standard _ asca _",
    "reduction procedures resulting in an effective observation time is @xmath7  ks .    near the center of the field - of - view",
    "we find a faint unresolved point source within the large @xmath8 radius error circle for .",
    "the pulsar s poor astrometry is due to the extreme off - axis detector location of the discovery observation . the faint source is also detected by _",
    "s solid - state imaging spectrometers ( siss ) ( see fig 2 ) with a similar significance of @xmath9 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the sis is @xmath10 , but the derived coordinates of @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( j2000 ) have an uncertainty of only @xmath13 after correcting for the temperature dependent coordinate offsets ( gotthelf  2000 ) .",
    "we refer to this source as , and consider whether this is indeed the expected pulsar , but at a flux level an order of magnitude less than expected ; the dearth of source photon prohibits a proper spectral analysis or search for pulsations , which might allow identification with .",
    "radio observations of the field of  were made with the d - configuration of the very large array ( vla ) on 1999 march 26 .",
    "the total observing time was 6  hr , of which 4.5  hr was spent observing in the 5  ghz band , and the remainder in the 8  ghz band . at both 5 and 8  ghz a distinct shell of emission is seen , which is designated ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the shell is clumpy , with a particularly bright clump on its eastern edge . in the east",
    "the shell is quite thick ( up to 50% of the radius ) , while the north - western rim is brighter and narrower .",
    "two point sources can be seen within the shell interior .    the shell - like radio emission ( @xmath14 in diameter ) is found to be linearly polarized and non - thermal , which , along with the lack of significant counterpart in 60 @xmath15 m _ iras _  data , are characteristic properties of supernova remnants ( e.g. whiteoak & green 1996 ) . g29.6 + 0.1 is thus classified as a previously unidentified snr .",
    "its inferred age suggests a young remnant , with an upper limit of 8000  yr .",
    "the location of the x - ray source  at the center of the snr is highly unlikely to be due to a chance superposition , suggestion that the two are related .",
    "the lack of a bright pulsator in the new _ asca _  observation of is quite surprising .",
    "the spectral and temporal properties of this pulsar had strongly implied an axp interpretation .",
    "indeed the discovery of a young radio remnant coincident with the pulsar is consistent with the axp hypothesis .",
    "conversely , the detection of an x - ray point source in the center of the snr is in itself indicative of a neutron star candidate associated with the remnant .",
    "this new source is exactly where we would expect the axp to be , to within errors , consistent with this interpretation .",
    "we therefore suggest that is indeed the pulsar , but at a much reduced ( @xmath16 order of magnitude ) x - ray flux .",
    "we now consider the interesting possibility that axp can exhibit extreme , factor of ten , variability .",
    "there is some evidence for this already from two well studied axps which show large @xmath17 variations in flux on year timescales ( e.g. 1e  1048.1 - 593 , oosterbroek  1998 ) .",
    "most intriguing , the properties of the central , unpulsed , neutron star candidate in snr rcw 103 are otherwise typical of the axps , but its flux has also been found to vary by an order of magnitude at energies @xmath18 kev ( gotthelf , petre , & vasisht 1999 ) , just what is observed for .",
    "conversely , this provides further evidence that rcw 103 is an axp with unseen pulsations , perhaps due to unfavorable beaming geometry .",
    "the identification of another axp at the center of a young snr have important implications on the birth properties of pulsars .",
    "this result is certainly consistent with axps being young , isolated neutron stars , as argued by the magnetar hypothesis .",
    "there is the possibility then that axps might exhibit periods of enhanced emission . in this case",
    ", the population of axps might be much greater than previously thought , and we are only detecting a fraction of axp , those currently in their bright `` on '' state .",
    "perhaps a duty - cycle ( fraction of time the axp is `` on '' ) of only @xmath19 would be required to square the known galactic snrs population with the detected axps , if most young neutron stars manifest themselves as axps as some authors suggest ( see gotthelf 1998 ) .",
    "although the magnetar hypothesis is attractive , we can not reject a a binary system origin , perhaps embedded and associated with a young snr .",
    "further monitoring of this region is planned .",
