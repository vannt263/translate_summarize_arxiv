    "how many ways are there to pack balls into a box ?",
    "the answer , of course , is infinitely many , since each ball can be placed in a continuum of different positions .",
    "however , if one tried to count the different arrangements , one would notice that many of them are very similar .",
    "the predominant packing arrangements for a given concentration @xmath0 ( the fraction of the total volume occupied by the balls ) are summarised by the hard - sphere equilibrium phase diagram , which is well known when all spheres are of equal size @xcite .",
    "a face - centred - cubic ( fcc ) crystal phase exists for any concentration from close packing at @xmath1 @xcite down to @xmath2 . for @xmath3",
    "a fluid phase exists in which configurations are amorphous , and between these two concentrations , statistical weight is dominated by systems partitioned into fluid and crystalline regions . on the other hand ,",
    "when differently - sized balls are considered , the full phase diagram is not known .",
    "it may seem at first surprising that such a straightforward question is still a field of active research .",
    "the subject is not merely of idle interest .",
    "many real substances , particularly colloids , are composed of spherical particles with negligible energetic interactions except for a hard repulsion at contact . for a further , very large class of substances , the hard - sphere model is a useful starting point for more accurate theories @xcite .",
    "studying their configurations is of central importance to our understanding of matter , and has implications for the development of new materials .",
    "it is often assumed that the configurations observed in a real material , such as a hard - sphere colloid , are those of highest entropy ( lowest free energy for non - hard - sphere interactions ) , i.e.  those which dominate the counting of all possible arrangements . on this equilibrium assumption , many efforts have been devoted to exploring the elaborate phase diagram of hard - sphere mixtures . since the particles never exchange potential energy , temperature does not influence their configurations , only their speeds .",
    "so the phase diagram has only as many axes as there are different sizes of sphere in the mixture , each axis representing the concentration of one type of particle . when just two species of balls are mixed , the diagram is already complicated , with theory @xcite and experiment @xcite finding regions of fluid , pure crystals , and crystalline alloys of the a and b type particles in the ratios ab , ab@xmath4 or even ab@xmath5 depending on the size ratio . in the ` polydisperse ' hard - sphere phase diagram , for systems such as real colloids ,",
    "in which each particle is slightly different from every other , an infinite number of axes is needed to span the space of all possible compositions .",
    "a small corner of this phase diagram has been charted by experiments @xcite , simulations @xcite and theories based on phenomenological free energies @xcite , integral equations @xcite , cell theory @xcite and perturbation about a monodisperse system @xcite .",
    "when the overall concentration of particles is low , an amorphous fluid phase inevitably results . at higher concentrations",
    ", it is expected that crystals of quite monodisperse ( similarly sized ) particles can form , even when the overall size distribution is broad @xcite , in which case , particles of the wrong size to be included in the crystal remain in a coexisting fluid phase .",
    "many predictions exist for the equilibrium distribution of particle sizes in a polydisperse crystal at coexistence with a fluid .",
    "we shall argue that such equilibrium states are not as straightforwardly applicable to colloidal systems as might be expected , and shall calculate an alternative distribution of particle sizes , which we expect to comprise the crystallites observed in real suspensions .",
    "the size distribution of particles incorporated into colloidal crystals is determined by the kinetics of their formation and , as we shall explain , never relaxes to the equilibrium distribution , remaining instead as a relic of that process .",
    "despite the fact that the state of the system evolves while the crystals are growing , we shall show that a large temporal regime exists during which the distribution of species incorporated into a growing crystal is invariant with time .",
    "hence , during this regime , there exists a unique solution for the distribution constituting the crystal .",
    "we expect this kinetically mediated distribution to be trapped within colloidal crystallites in laboratory samples that are quiescent and therefore _ appear _ to have reach equilibrium .",
    "we shall find that the particles buried deep within a crystallite are on average _ smaller _ than would be expected from an equilibrium calculation .",
    "if attractions exist between the hard particles , the effect can be so marked as to swamp the thermodynamic driving force that favours _",
    "larger _ than average particles in the equilibrium crystal phase .",
    "the rest of the article is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall discuss the formal procedure for obtaining the equilibrium phase diagram of an @xmath6component hard sphere system .",
    "we then go on to discuss the evidence that experimental hard sphere systems are not at equilibrium . in section [ gendiffusion ]",
    "we construct the most general equations of motion for diffusive growth of a polydisperse hard - sphere crystal , and show that there exists a time regime during which the distribution of particles dynamically incorporated into the crystal has a time - invariant solution .",
    "it will transpire that the crystalline distribution is one that appears on the phase boundary in the _ equilibrium _ phase diagram , but is not located on the expected tie line , due to temporary violation of the lever rule . using a low - concentration approximation for the diffusion coefficients in the fluid phase",
    ", we shall derive , in section [ modlever ] , a simple replacement for the lever rule , which yields the appropriate distributions for this non - equilibrium situation . in section [ perturb ]",
    "we derive the conditions for local mechanical and chemical balance at the crystal - fluid interface ( equivalent to finding binodals in the equilibrium phase diagram ) using , for convenience , a perturbative approximation that is valid for narrow distributions .",
    "section [ results ] contains our results , and we conclude in section [ conc ] .",
    "as explained above , the phase diagram of single sized ( monodisperse ) hard spheres is well known .",
    "the phase behaviour may be calculated via a theoretical treatment in the following way .",
    "first , an expression for the helmholtz free energy of the fluid and crystalline phases must be found . from this , one has knowledge of all thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the phase boundaries are then determined by finding the values of @xmath0 for which the pressure and chemical potential are equal in two phases , signalling mechanical and chemical equilibrium between the phases .",
    "the volumes of the two coexisting phases may be found by application of the lever rule , @xmath7 in terms of the system volume @xmath8 .",
    "the subscript @xmath9 refers to a quantity in the crystal phase , @xmath10 refers to the fluid phase , and @xmath11 to the overall , or _",
    "parent _ distribution .",
    "the lever rule follows from conservation of material in the system .",
    "the situation is immediately complicated if we consider a system containing differently sized particles , although the formal procedure is wholly analogous .",
    "we illustrate this firstly by a glance at a system of binary hard spheres .",
    "the phase diagram is now 2-dimensional , so the task of finding coexisting phases is a problem in 4 variables , because one must determine the concentrations of 2 species for each of the 2 phases .",
    "coexisting phases must have equal pressures , as well as equal chemical potential for each species .",
    "these 3 constraints on 4 unknowns leads to a locus of fluid ( crystal ) states in the phase diagram which can coexist with a crystal ( fluid ) phase .",
    "we now have two lever rules , one for each species , which supply the extra constraints needed to fix coexisting points , and to fix the volume of the crystal phase .    in the case of an _",
    "n_-component system , there are @xmath12 constraints arising from equality of pressure and @xmath13 chemical potentials .",
    "the problem of finding two coexisting points in the @xmath13-dimensional space of the phase diagram is a @xmath14-dimensional problem , leaving us with @xmath15-dimensional phase boundaries .",
    "there are now @xmath13 lever rules , one for each species , allowing us to fix coexisting points on the phase boundaries , as well as the ratio of phase volumes .",
    "we note that , in the continuously polydisperse case , the equations remain closed despite the infinite number of thermodynamic variables .",
    "therefore , in principle at least , we know how to calculate the equilibrium phase behaviour of any hard sphere system .",
    "the practicalities of phase separation in real systems are a different matter , which we now proceed to discuss .",
    "in a polydisperse hard - sphere system each particle has a slightly different size . in a given sample",
    "then , there will be a thermodynamically large number of species present , and thus the free energy is a function of the same number of concentration variables .",
    "as such a system tends towards equilibrium , it must minimise its free energy with respect to these variables .",
    "the minimisation in this case is obviously much more complicated than in the monodisperse situation , where there is only one relevant parameter .    to reach the equilibrium state from some initial state",
    "which an experimenter prepares by mixing and homogenising , the system must separate itself into distinct regions of coexisting phases . even in the relatively simple case of monodisperse phase separation , there are many pathways by which the phase separation may occur @xcite . in the polydisperse case",
    ", the situation is complicated further , as the densities of individual species need not relax at the same rate as the overall density .",
    "one could conceive a situation whereby phase equilibrium is approached by a two - stage process , as has been suggested previously for polymeric systems @xcite . in such a scenario ,",
    "the polydisperse system initially lowers its free energy by a quick and expedient demixing of material to form the separate phase regions .",
    "subsequently , the distributions of species within the phases are further optimised to attain the absolute minimum of free energy , which requires particles to be exchanged between the separate regions . alternatively",
    ", it would be possible for the system to separate into the two phases with the optimum particle distribution right from the start .",
    "perhaps more realistically , the separation could proceed along a path somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "a clue to how the separation does occur is found in experiments on colloids of attractive particles .",
    "colloidal systems may , given a sufficiently long ranged inter - particle attraction , exhibit two fluid phases , analogous to the liquid and gas phases of atomic systems .",
    "observations of the fluid - fluid phase separation reveal that the process is approximately as swift in the polydisperse case as in the near - monodisperse @xcite .",
    "given that minimisation of the polydisperse free energy must be carried out with respect to many more variables , it might be expected that the additional ` sorting ' required would result in a slower relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "this suggests that the initial phase separation is not the end of the story  the systems are relaxing to equilibrium by a two - stage process , with an initial fast separation of material , followed by particle exchange to absolutely minimise the free energy .",
    "such an optimisation stage is feasible between two fluid phases as , given sufficient time , particles can diffuse between phases . in a hard - sphere fluid - crystal phase separation , however , the system has a problem .",
    "the caging of particles by their neighbours suppresses diffusion within the crystal to a very low rate , mediated only by lattice defects .",
    "optimising the population of particles in the crystal , by exchanging a macroscopic amount of material with the adjacent fluid region , is therefore unachievable on experimental time scales .",
    "hence we expect the crystalline population to be arrested in a non - equilibrium state , so that the footprint of the initial , expedient stage of phase separation remains observable at late times .",
    "therefore , if we wish to make predictions as to the phase behaviour of hard - sphere colloids , we need to move away from equilibrium predictions and to model the process of crystal growth .",
    "we now develop such a model , with a view to predicting the size distribution which forms within a polydisperse hard - sphere crystal .",
    "in this section , we outline the treatment of the kinetic process during crystal - fluid phase separation .",
    "we begin by considering a size - polydisperse sample of colloidal particles suspended in solvent , prepared with a composition lying in the fluid - crystal coexistence region of the phase diagram .",
    "the sample is assumed to be initially homogeneous .",
    "eventually , a crystal will randomly nucleate somewhere in the fluid , creating a concentration gradient in the fluid , as the immediate vicinity of the growing crystal is depleted of particles .",
    "particles will diffuse down this gradient towards the crystal , with the smaller particles diffusing more quickly .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ crystalformation ] .",
    "it should be noted that the latent heat released during the crystal formation does not hinder crystallisation .",
    "this is because the solvent acts as a heat bath , keeping the temperature of the system constant .",
    "we wish to find the composition of the crystal , for which we require the time- and position - dependent composition of the surrounding fluid .",
    "let us characterise each particle species by its radius , @xmath16 .",
    "the number density @xmath17 is a function of position and time , as is the diffusive flux @xmath18 , for particles with sizes in the interval @xmath19 .",
    "we begin with an expression of continuity , @xmath20 and a generalisation of fick s law to polydisperse particles , to describe the diffusive dynamics of the fluid phase , @xmath21)\\ , \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$ }      \\rho(a',\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$},t)\\ : \\mbox{d}a'\\ ] ] which tells us that the flux of a particular species depends on the concentration gradients of _ all _ species .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath22)$ ] , is a functional of the composition @xmath23 .",
    "later , we will introduce a particular form for @xmath24 , but for now we continue with the general case .",
    "we must also describe the physics of the interface between the fluid and crystalline regions .",
    "firstly , we demand conservation of material .",
    "if @xmath25 is the position of the interface , in unit time the interface advances a distance @xmath26 . in this time , unit area of the crystal surface ` swallows up ' a volume @xmath26 of the fluid , requiring an additional @xmath27 particles , where @xmath28 is the ( positive ) difference in densities across the interface .",
    "so @xmath26 is related to the flux across the interface by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a unit normal to the interface .",
    "various empirical approximations exist for the flux across the interface between non - equilibrium phases . in the following",
    ", the details of the approximation will turn out to be unimportant .",
    "we choose the standard wilson - frenkel law @xcite which , for a monodisperse system , is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant , @xmath33 is a short - time self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath34 is the chemical potential difference across the interface ( with units such that @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 is the interfacial width .",

    "the mobility is a functional of the whole set of concentrations present .",
    "we now search for a solution to our equations . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the crystal grows with spherical symmetry , neglecting the possibilities of faceting or dendritic growth .",
    "we try a solution in which lengths scale as @xmath40 , the validity of which will be examined _ a posteriori_. we may then replace @xmath41 . with this assumption , we can write the density of particles of radius @xmath16 as @xmath42 . at a given value of r ,",
    "the density remains constant in time ; the diffusive flux , however , will fall off as @xmath43 , as it is proportional to density gradients .",
    "we write the flux as @xmath44 .",
    "let us use these variables to re - write the relevant equations .",
    "the generalised wilson - frenkel law becomes @xmath45 ) \\left\\{\\frac{\\exp{\\delta",
    "\\mu(a')}-1}{\\lambda t^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right\\}\\mbox{d}a'.\\ ] ] note that @xmath36 , the width of the interface , is the only length which does not scale as @xmath40 .",
    "since the flux @xmath46 is now independent of @xmath47 , the rhs must also be time independent , so we have @xmath48 with some ( unknown ) function @xmath49 , which gives @xmath50 at late times , confirming our expectation that the interface tends to local equilibrium .",
    "the wilson - frenkel law has demonstrated the relevant physics , that lengths controlling sub - interfacial dynamics remain microscopic and therefore become irrelevant .",
    "the equation of continuity may also be written in terms of the scaled variables . as spherical symmetry is assumed , we transform to @xmath51-dimensional spherical coordinates .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ cont1 ] ) becomes @xmath52 similarly , we write fick s law [ eq .",

    "our scaling solution yields a unique answer ( though not the equilibrium one ) for the crystalline composition ( for a given system and parent ) .",
    "in other words , the crystal grows uniformly .",
    "we now have a closed pair of time - independent equations [ eqs .",

    "( [ deltamu ] ) , local thermodynamic equilibrium across the interface .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath59 is @xmath60 since the _ parent _ distribution @xmath61 exists in the bulk .",
    "the fact that this asymptote remains time - independent is a consequence of our scaling solution , for which all lengths go as @xmath40 .",
    "we see , then , that this scaling solution describes the regime of growth _ before _ the distant composition of the super - saturated fluid has been depleted ( i.e.  while condensation nuclei grow as if isolated ) , but _",
    "after _ the crystal - fluid interface has locally equilibrated following the initial transients of nucleation .",
    "in order that an analytic solution is possible , we now make the simplest possible choice of the diffusion coefficient present in fick s law , and write @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the monodisperse diffusion coefficient of a particle of size @xmath16 , taken to be of stokes - einstein form . in making this approximation , our generalised fick s law reduces to the ordinary form for each species independently .",
    "this neglects the flux of a given species due to density gradients of all other species .",
    "this becomes correct in the low density limit @xcite , but will be incorrect at the large densities required for coexistence in a hard - sphere system . here , the generalised fick s law has been discarded , but a more sophisticated treatment could utilise it along with a more accurate approximation to the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",

    "( [ lr ] ) and ( [ flr ] ) , we note that eq .",
    "( [ flr ] ) may be considered an alternative to the lever rule in our non - equilibrium system .",
    "obviously we must conserve matter in the non - equilibrium system as a whole , but here we are only considering a certain region , into which there is a flux of material .    in the same way as the lever rule closes the set of equations governing equilibrium phase behaviour ( and fixes @xmath78 ) , eq .",

    "that is , @xmath120 i.e.  @xmath111 is the distance of the quench from the monodisperse phase boundary , as a fraction of the width of the coexistence region . the unknown crystal growth rate @xmath56 is then given , in terms of the inverse of the function @xmath121 , by @xmath122 with @xmath123 evaluated at @xmath102 .",
    "taylor expansion of eq .",
    "( [ flr ] ) then gives @xmath124 where @xmath125 evaluated at @xmath102 .    by integration of eq .",
    "( [ crystal.density ] ) , one finds that ( to first order ) the overall densities of each phase are unchanged from the monodisperse values . hence , on the rhs of eqs .",
    "( [ normdistns1 ] ) and ( [ normdistns2 ] ) , we may use the monodisperse , equilibrium values of these quantities .",
    "the formal expressions obtained are now applied to the case study of non - attracting polydisperse hard spheres , for which the value of the parameter @xmath126^c_f$ ] has been determined previously @xcite as @xmath127 in units of @xmath128 .",
    "equations ( [ important ] ) , ( [ normdistns1 ] ) and ( [ normdistns2 ] ) allow calculation of density profiles in our system .",
    "an example is plotted in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] , which shows density profiles calculated for a non - attractive hard - sphere system in @xmath129 spatial dimensions .",
    "one can see that the diffusion process transports small particles to the crystal - fluid interface in relatively greater abundance than it does large particles ( relative to the numbers in the parent distribution ) .",
    "thus , when thermodynamic effects ( of local equilibrium at the crystal - fluid interface ) decide which particles are incorporated into the crystal , the choice is made from a biased version of the parent .",
    "the result of this is that the crystal is made up of particles which are , on average , smaller than would be the case in equilibrium .",
    "= 8.5 cm    equation ( [ normdistns1 ] ) allows us to calculate the size distribution in the crystal , given any narrow parent . as an example we use a gaussian parent . for comparison the resulting distributions in the fluid and crystal , for a system which has reached thermodynamic equilibrium ( as predicted by the equilibrium perturbation theory @xcite )",
    "are displayed in fig .",
    "[ eq.distn ] .",
    "we note that the crystal has a preference for larger particles , telling us that entropy is maximised if the particles are partitioned in this way .",
    "heuristically , this is because the particles positional entropy in the fluid phase is increased if more space is made available by removing the larger particles to the crystal phase .",
    "what then is the effect of the growth process on the size distributions ?",
    "the effect can be seen by plotting the difference between size distributions in the crystal as predicted by the kinetic and equilibrium calculations .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ difference ] .",
    "= 6.5 cm    we see the effect of kinetics is to bias the distribution in the crystal towards smaller sizes .",
    "we take the first moment of eq .",
    "( [ normdistns1 ] ) , to find the mean size @xmath130 in the crystal , which is a function of the overall concentration in the system .",
    "it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ crystalmean ] as a function of the relative supersaturation @xmath111 beyond the fluid phase boundary .    at @xmath131 ,",
    "the system is at equilibrium , at its cloud point , since the fluid is not supersaturated , and the crystal phase at coexistence occupies an infinitesimal volume . as a result , the growth rate @xmath56 vanishes , and the mean size deviation in the crystal attains its equilibrium value @xmath132 . as the supersaturation of the initial fluid state increases , the mean particle size in the crystal becomes smaller , in an almost ( though not quite ) linear fashion . in the limit where the initial state is so dense that crystallisation induces no density change ,",
    "the mean size in the crystal equals that in the parent ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "note that , in the hard - sphere system , though the effect of kinetics is to reduce the mean particle size in the crystal , it remains larger than the overall parental mean , i.e.  @xmath134 .",
    "hence , in a sense , the thermodynamic effects of crystal - fluid partitioning win over the kinetics .",
    "we find this is a consequence of the small density change at the hard - sphere crystal - fluid phase transition ( @xmath135 ) . in a second case study ( not presented here )",
    ", we have substituted into eq .",
    "( [ normdistns1 ] ) parameters appropriate to a system of hard spheres with attractive interactions @xcite ( in particular , the ` depletion ' interaction arising in colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite ) . in that case , the coexistence region can become much broader since , with strong attractions , even a very dilute gas of hard spheres can crystallise . then",
    ", we find a range of values of @xmath111 for which crystals form from particles _ smaller _ on average than the mean composition of the system , i.e.  @xmath136 , signalling the dominance of the kinetic effects presented here .",
    "the kinetics of polydisperse systems are sufficiently complex that few analytical or even numerical studies have been attempted .",
    "exceptions are refs .  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have argued that colloidal hard - sphere systems ( which are inevitably polydisperse ) form crystals whose composition is not at equilibrium , i.e.  does not maximise the entropy of the two - phase ensemble .",
    "instead , particles are caged in the crystalline structure . in practise",
    ", some small - scale re - arrangements within the crystal can take place in the presence of lattice defects , but the rate of particle diffusion is negligible ( particularly with inter - particle attractions ) compared to that in the fluid phase . as a result ,",
    "the distribution of particle sizes frozen into a colloidal crystal remains as a relic of its growth mechanism .",
    "the establishment of chemical equilibrium requires a significant fraction of each chemical species to be exchanged many times between the crystal and fluid phases . a hypothetical system",
    "in which this occurs , so that phase space is fully explored and distributions are optimised , would preferentially partition more large particles into the crystal phase , so that particles in the coexisting fluid have more space in which to enjoy positional entropy .",
    "in contrast , the diffusive growth process biases the crystalline composition towards small particles , since they can travel most quickly from the distant bulk of the ambient fluid . while the mean particle size at the crystal - fluid interface must be larger in the crystal side than in the adjacent fluid , the largest , most sluggish particles remain predominantly in the fluid bulk .",
    "the regime for which we were able to find analytical solutions of the equations of motion was at intermediate times , when all relevant lengths scale with time as @xmath40 .",
    "that is , after transients associated with the initial random nucleation event have passed so that , on the scale of the interfacial width ( a few particle diameters ) , the phases are at local equilibrium , but before the fluid zone of depleted concentration around each condensation nucleus begins to overlap with its neighbours , so that the distant fluid composition still asymptotes to the initial ( ` parent ' ) mixture .",
    "once these depleted regions do significantly overlap , the supersaturation of the fluid phase is soon exhausted .",
    "the remaining mix of predominantly large particles , which have remained in the fluid , will eventually coat each crystallite , and growth will cease when no concentration gradient remains in the fluid .",
    "hence , in laboratory samples , we expect the inert colloidal crystallites to have an unknown core of a few particles which collected together during the early nucleation stage , a significant bulk of the uniform composition we have calculated , and a non - uniform coating of larger particles",
    ". happily , equilibrium phase diagrams , which have previously been calculated , are not redundant , as the uniform composition from the scaling regime of crystal growth does lie on the equilibrium phase boundary , though not on the tie - line specified by the usual lever rule . for our calculation to be useful , the core region of each crystallite , whose composition we do not know , must be small compared with the whole crystallite , which requires a low concentration _ of condensation nuclei _ to appear in the system .",
    "the above scenario should hold , no matter how the diffusion matrix ( which determines the flux of each species induced by concentration gradients of any other species ) varies with concentration .",
    "though collective motions and many - body interactions lead to a non - linear diffusion equation for the fluid @xcite , this affects details of the shape of the concentration profiles in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] , but does not alter the @xmath40 growth law or the conditions of local interfacial equilibrium , leading to a uniform crystalline composition . also , the qualitative principle remains , that small particles diffuse most quickly .    to find quantitative solutions ,",
    "however , we were compelled to make two approximations .",
    "the first , in order to diagonalize the diffusion matrix , was a low concentration approximation which , though it has a regime of validity near the fluid phase boundary of attractive systems , is otherwise quantitatively poor . in its favour , it yields qualitatively significant results .",
    "the trend in fig .",
    "[ crystalmean ] , for instance , is correct , tending as it does from an equilibrium result at the fluid phase boundary ( zero supersaturation , @xmath131 ) to a total absence of demixing at the crystal boundary ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "our second approximation holds true for many experimental systems .",
    "hard - sphere colloids can be synthesised @xcite with a narrow distribution of particle sizes ( typically @xmath138 tolerance in the radii ) , for which perturbation about a monodisperse reference state , to first order in size deviations , has been shown to yield accurate results for two - phase equilibrium @xcite , which is local in this case .",
    "the perturbation expansion holds , given that the perturbation ( i.e.  the width of the distribution ) is sufficiently small . with increasing polydispersity , the system is expected to exhibit singular behaviour , partitioning its particles into several coexisting crystal phases of more uniformly sized particles @xcite , or forming alloys with more complex unit cells @xcite , to avoid costly lattice interstitials of very mis - sized particles . in that case , the growth may be controlled by the kinetics of segregation at interfaces , leading to different physics from the diffusion - limited regime calculated here .",
