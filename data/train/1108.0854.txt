    "scanning tunneling microscopic studies have been able to measure spin and charge densities at various positions in the molecule .",

    "early studies by goutermann employed a four orbital model to explain the nature of the @xmath2 band ( the low - frequency weak absorption band ) and the soret ( @xmath3 ) band ( the high frequency intense absorption band ) observed in porphyrins @xcite . weiss _",

    "porphyrin molecule is a fairly large system and hence is not amenable to accurate ab - initio studies .",
    "however , most of the interesting properties of porphyrin are associated with the @xmath1system .",
    "thus the electronic properties of porphyrins can be modeled by employing the well known ppp model for the @xmath1electrons .",
    "the porphyrinic @xmath1system consists of 24 orbitals in conjugation occupied by 26 electrons .",
    "even though the fock space of the system is finite ( @xmath7 ) , the large hilbert space of porphine , prohibits doing an exact quantum many body calculation . specializing to desired total spin and occupancy still leaves the hilbert space dimension to be very large ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "approximate techniques such as restricted configuration interaction ( ci ) for a few low - lying states is not very reliable , since it relies on cancellation of errors , as in single ci .",
    "thus it is important to bring to bear novel and accurate methods for important low - lying states as well as nlo response coefficient of the systems .    in this paper , we have employed the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method to carry out reliable model many - body calculations of the ground and excited state properties . in the next section",
    "we give a brief introduction to the dmrg method . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the model hamiltonian and implementation of the dmrg method to porphines . in section iv",
    ", we present our results on the properties of the low - lying states of porphine . in section",
    "v , we discuss the dynamic nonlinear optic coefficient computed for the system .",
    "the dmrg algorithm involves efficient and accurate ways of truncating the insignificant degrees of freedom from the fock space of the system . the dmrg method proceeds as follows .",
    "given a model many body hamiltonian @xmath9 which we wish to solve for a system with total number of sites @xmath10 .",
    "we start with a small lattice of @xmath11 sites and obtain the hamiltonian matrix of this lattice in the real space basis .",
    "we obtain by standard methods , the lowest or the desired eigenstates of the hamiltonian matrix . from the eigenvector",
    "we construct the density matrix @xmath12 , of the subsystems with l sites by integrating out the states of the remaining l sites .",
    "the matrix elements of the density matrix , @xmath13 of the l sites block in the @xmath14 eigenstate is given by , @xmath15 where the @xmath14 eigenstate of the 2l sites problem is expressed as @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the fock space basis states of the system and environment blocks respectively and @xmath19 are the associated coefficients .",
    "the density matrix @xmath20 is diagonalized and eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath21 dominant eigenvalues of @xmath20 are used to span the fock space of the system block . if the order of the matrix @xmath20 is @xmath22 , then the @xmath23 matrix @xmath24 formed from @xmath21 eigenvectors as columns of the @xmath25 is used for transforming all the operators of the system block , l , from the full fock space to the truncated density matrix eigenvector basis .",
    "thus if a is an @xmath22 matrix of an operator @xmath26 defined over the @xmath27 dimensional fock space of the system block , then @xmath28 gives the renormalized @xmath29 matrix representation of @xmath26 . by interchanging the environment and system blocks",
    ", we also obtain renormalized matrix representation of all the operators in the former environment block .",
    "we now add two new sites to the @xmath11 size system at a convenient part of the system , usually in the middle .",
    "using as basis functions , the direct product of the density matrix eigenvectors of the two blocks of the @xmath11 system and the fock states of the new sites , we can obtain a matrix representation of the @xmath30 site hamiltonian . from the desired eigenstate @xmath31 we obtain the density matrix @xmath32 for the two blocks of size @xmath33 of the augmented ( 2l+2 ) site system and proceed as before to obtain all the renormalized operators on the @xmath33 sites and iterate until the desired system size is reached .",
    "this algorithm of constructing the system is called the infinite dmrg algorithm . in this algorithm , from the eigenvectors at any system size , we can also obtain expectation values of any operator of interest .",
    "if the operator consists of product of site operators of different sites in the same block , then we need to carry through matrix representation of the product by renormalizing it at each step and use the renormalized matrix to compute the desired expectation value .",
    "if on the other hand the operator is a product of site operators of different sites on different blocks , we can use the renormalized matrix representation of the individual site operators to compute the expectation values .",
    "it is possible to target more than one low - lying state simultaneously in a dmrg procedure .",
    "this is carried out by computing the density matrix for each desired states separately and using the dominant eigenvectors of an appropriately averaged density matrix of these states . the choice of common dmrg basis for different states permits computing matrix elements such as transition dipoles between states . to access higher excited states of interest such as the @xmath34 states in polyenes ,",
    "we need to employ symmetrized dmrg procedure and compute the desired excited state as a low - lying state in an appropriate symmetry subspace .",
    "for example , we could access a triplet state as the lowest energy excitation in a space of odd parity , other parity symmetry corresponds to the invariance of the hamiltonian when the spin space is rotated by @xmath35 around the y - axis .    for molecular systems",
    "the infinite dmrg technique is not sufficiently accurate since the density matrix of the system block does not correspond to the density matrix of the target superblock .",
    "this can can be remedied by employing the finite dmrg algorithm . in this technique",
    "the infinite algorithm is employed till the desired superblock is attained .",
    "after this point , the system block is augmented by one site and the hamiltonian matrix of the superblock is set up using the larger system block , two new site and an environment block with one fewer site generated in the infinite algorithm . from the desired eigenstate of the hamiltonian matrix , the system block",
    "is again augmented by one site and the whole process is repeated until the environment block reduces to a single site . from here on , the environment block and system block are interchanged and the process continued until we reach the size of environment and system block achieved at the end of the infinite dmrg algorithm .",
    "this process of progressively increasing the size of the system block and decreasing the size of the environment block , back and forth is called finite dmrg algorithm @xcite .",
    "the dmrg technique has been shown to be highly accurate for quasi - one dimensional systems and has been widely employed in the study of the strongly correlated model hamiltonians such as the hubbard models @xcite , the ppp models @xcite and the heisenberg spin models @xcite .",
    "the ppp model has long range interactions and topologically the model can be viewed as a higher dimensional model .",
    "however , the interaction terms in the ppp model are diagonal in the real space and are hence well accounted for in the dmrg method .    in this work ,",
    "we report our studies on free base porphine ( fbp ) and metallo - porphines obtained from dmrg studies of their electronic structure .",
    "porphine is modeled by ppp model with ohno parametrization for the long - range interactions .",
    "we have studied the optical excitation spectrum by using symmetrized dmrg method @xcite .",
    "we characterize optically excited states by studying various properties of the states , such as , charge densities and bond orders .",
    "we have also studied both linear and nonlinear optical properties of the system .",
    "porphine contains 4 pyrrolic rings connected by 4 @xmath36 groups as shown in fig .",
    "[ porfig1 ] .",
    "nitrogen in the pentagons are @xmath37 hybridized . there are two types of nitrogen atoms in the conjugation , one is the aza nitrogen and the other is the pyrrole like nitrogen .",
    "lone - pair of electrons on n are in the plane of the molecule in aza - ring systems and do not participate in conjugation , whereas , they are perpendicular to the plane of the ring and are involved in @xmath35-conjugation , in pyrrole rings .",
    "the singly occupied @xmath38 orbital of the aza nitrogens are involved in @xmath35-conjugation .",
    "each carbon atom in the conjugation contributes one electron to @xmath35-system .",
    "thus , in free base porphine , 26 @xmath1electrons and 24 orbitals are involved in conjugation . it has been established that ppp model is well suited for describing the electronic properties of conjugated organic molecules .",
    "the ppp model hamiltonian is given by @xmath39    here @xmath40 corresponds to the one - electron part of the hamiltonian with the orbital energy , @xmath41 , of @xmath38 orbital and @xmath42 , the transfer integral between the orbitals @xmath43 and @xmath44 on the bonded pair of atoms in conjugation .",
    "we discuss the parametrization involving n - orbitals later .",
    "we have used experimental geometry for our calculations @xcite .",
    "the transfer integrals , @xmath42 are calculated using a linear extrapolation . i.e. @xmath45 @xmath46 is the transfer integral ( @xmath47 ) corresponding to @xmath48 bond length of @xmath49   in benzene and @xmath50 is ( @xmath51 )   where @xmath52 is the length of the bond between atoms i and j.    the term @xmath53 in the ppp hamiltonian incorporates on - site electron - electron repulsion energy and this corresponds to hubbard interaction .",
    "the hubbard parameter @xmath54 is the energy cost for creating double occupancy of the orbital @xmath43 . for carbon",
    "we have taken the standard value of @xmath55 ev .",
    "the terms in @xmath56 correspond to inter - site coulombic interaction between electrons in orbitals i and j , and we introduce local chemical potential @xmath57 which is the occupancy of the orbital @xmath43 that leaves the @xmath58 site electronically neutral . the value of @xmath59 for c is always 1 while that of nitrogen depends upon the occupancy of the orbital involved in conjugation , for the aza - nitrogen which contributes one electron to the @xmath1conjugation , @xmath59 is 1 , while for the pyrrole nitrogen which contributes two electrons to the @xmath1conjugation , @xmath59 is 2 ; @xmath60 is calculated using ohno parametrization @xcite .",
    "we have parametrized @xmath41 and @xmath61 for nitrogen atom to fit the experimental excitation gaps and corresponding transition dipole moments for singlets in free base porphine .",
    "the parameters which give the best fit are as follows : for aza nitrogens , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; for pyrrole nitrogens , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is taken to be @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 single and double bonds respectively .",
    "other transfer integrals calculated from eq . [ eq22 ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ porfig1 ] .",
    "the nitrogen parameters reflect the more compact @xmath70 orbitals of nitrogen compared to @xmath70 orbitals of carbon .",
    "+    we have employed the dmrg methods to study the ground state ( gs ) and low - lying states of porphine .",
    "the topology of the transfer terms in porphines is not strictly one dimensional .",
    "the porphine system can be built up from a 4-site ring , by adding two sites at a time , in many different ways .",
    "the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ porfig2 ] provides a highly accurate scheme for building up the porphine framework , besides retaining the symmetries of porphine at every stage of the dmrg implementation .",
    "we have also carried out finite dmrg sweeps to improve the accuracy .",
    "the accuracy of the dmrg scheme is bench - marked against hckel model results for the system . in the dmrg studies",
    ", we have retained 210 density matrix eigenvectors ( dmevs ) and carried out two finite dmrg sweeps .",
    "the order of the hamiltonian matrix is about @xmath71 after using two symmetries , namely , spin invariance and @xmath72 symmetry .",
    "the matrix is sparse and symmetric .",
    "we obtain a few low - lying states of the matrix using davidson algorithm .",
    "various properties such as charge and spin densities and b.o.s in different eigenstates can be computed since the matrices of the creation operators , the occupation number operators of all the sites and the b.o operators of all the bonds are renormalized at every step .    in the molecular systems with strong electron correlations , it is difficult to identify the desired excited states such as two photon states or optically allowed excited states , unless symmetry is exploited .",
    "the hamiltonian is spin conserving , however , exploiting the conservation of both @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 corresponds to total spin ) within a dmrg scheme is difficult . instead we have used spin invariance symmetry and @xmath74 conservation , to reduce the dimensionalities of the spaces .",
    "spin invariance symmetry corresponds to invariance of the hamiltonian when all the spins are rotated by @xmath35 around the y - axis , within the @xmath76 ( @xmath77 is eigenvalue of @xmath74 operator ) subspace .",
    "the spin invariance operator divides the basis into two subspaces , one of even total spin and another of odd total spin .",
    "the spatial symmetry we have employed is the @xmath78 symmetry , even though the molecule has @xmath79 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath78 axis chosen by us passes through the center of the molecule and is perpendicular to molecular plane .",
    "the spin invariance symmetry commutes with the @xmath78 symmetry and the resulting group has four one dimensional representations .",
    "optical transitions are from states which are even under @xmath78 symmetry to those that are odd , and retain total spin .",
    "the triplet ( s=1 ) state is targeted as the lowest state in the @xmath80 sector . since we are dealing with a nonzero @xmath77 subspace , the spin invariance symmetry does not exist in this case and we only employ the spatial symmetry . besides , for computing properties such as transition dipoles and dynamic linear and nonlinear polarizabilities , we need to express states in the different symmetry subspace by using the same dmrg basis states . in order to retain proper balance of various states ,",
    "we construct an average density matrix , averaged over density matrices of several low - lying states in each subspace and employ dominant eigenvectors of the averaged density matrix .",
    "the dynamic nonlinear optics response coefficient are computed using correction vector ( cv ) technique @xcite .",
    "conventional frequency dependent linear and nonlinear optical coefficient calculations rely on the knowledge of transition dipole moments between the gs and all excited states . for exact calculation of nlo properties , the sum over states",
    "( sos ) method is most widely used .",
    "generally , between 30 to 100 excited states , computed within a restricted ci scheme are used to obtain nlo coefficients .",
    "soos and ramasesha @xcite introduced the cv method for calculating nlo coefficients within an exact diagonalization scheme which incorporates the contribution of all higher excited states , without explicitly obtaining the excited state eigenfunctions . in this method",
    ", a correction vector ( cv ) is obtained using the gs wavefunction and the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "cv method involves computation of the first and second order correction vectors @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which are defined as ,    @xmath83    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the hamiltonian matrix in the chosen many - body basis , @xmath86 is the gs energy , @xmath87 are the excitation frequencies and @xmath88 is the @xmath58 component of the dipole displacement operator , ( @xmath89 = @xmath90 ) , and @xmath91 is the average lifetime of the excited states . it can be shown that @xmath81 and @xmath92 when expressed in the basis of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath93  are given by ,    @xmath94    @xmath95    therefore @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be readily used to compute linear and nonlinear frequency dependent polarizabilities . the third order nlo coefficients corresponding to sum frequency generation , in terms of these correction vectors , are given by ,    @xmath98    where @xmath99 generate all permutations of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 leading to 24 terms for @xmath104  ( with @xmath105 = @xmath106 ) .",
