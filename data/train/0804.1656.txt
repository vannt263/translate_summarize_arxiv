    "one popular and important type of random graph is given by the uniformly distributed random graph with a given degree sequence , defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be a sequence of non - negative integers .",
    "we let @xmath3 be a random graph with degree sequence @xmath4 , uniformly chosen among all possibilities ( tacitly assuming that there is any such graph at all ; in particular , @xmath5 has to be even ) .",
    "it is well - known that it is often simpler to study the corresponding random multigraph @xmath6 with given degree sequence @xmath2 , defined for every sequence @xmath4 with @xmath7 even by the configuration model ( see e.g.=1000 @xcite ) : take a set of @xmath8 _ half - edges _ for each vertex @xmath9 , and combine the half - edges into pairs by a uniformly random matching of the set of all half - edges ( this pairing is called a _ configuration _ ) ; each pair of half - edges is then joined to form an edge of @xmath6 .",
    "we consider asymptotics as the numbers of vertices tend to infinity , and thus we assume throughout the paper that we are given , for each @xmath10 , a sequence @xmath11 with @xmath12 even .",
    "( as usual , we could somewhat more generally assume that we are given a sequence @xmath13 and for each @xmath14 a sequence @xmath15 . ) for notational simplicity we will usually not show the dependency on @xmath10 explicitly ; we thus write @xmath4 and @xmath8 , and similarly for other ( deterministic or random ) quantities introduced below .",
    "all unspecified limits and other asymptotic statements are for @xmath16 . for example , w.h.p ... =1000 ( with high probability ) means with probability tending to 1 as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 means convergence in probability as @xmath17. similarly , we use @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the standard way , always implying @xmath17 .",
    "for example , if @xmath21 is a parameter of the random graph , @xmath22 means that @xmath23 as @xmath17 for every @xmath24 ; equivalently , @xmath25 .",
    "we may obtain @xmath3 by conditioning the multigraph @xmath6 on being a ( simple ) graph , i.e.=1000 , on not having any multiple edges or loops .",
    "by @xcite ( with earlier partial results by many authors ) , @xmath26 in this case , many results transfer immediately from @xmath6 to @xmath3 , for example , every result of the type @xmath27 for some events @xmath28 , and thus every result saying that some parameter converges in probability to some non - random value .",
    "this includes every result in the present paper .",
    "we will in this paper study the random multigraph @xmath6 ; the reader can think of doing this either for its own sake or as a tool for studying @xmath3 .",
    "we leave the statement of corollaries for @xmath3 , using , to the reader . moreover , the results for @xmath3 extend to some other random graph models too , in particular @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 with @xmath33 , by the standard device of conditioning on the degree sequence ; again we omit the details and refer to @xcite where this method is used .",
    "we will consider percolation of these random ( multi)graphs , where we first generate a random graph @xmath6 and then delete either vertices or edges at random .",
    "( from now on , we simply write graph for multigraph. ) the methods below can be combined to treat the case of random deletion of both vertices and edges , which is studied by other methods in e.g.=1000 @xcite , but we leave this to the reader .    to be precise , we consider the following two constructions , given any graph @xmath34 and a probability @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "site percolation : :    randomly delete each vertex ( together with all incident edges ) with    probability @xmath36 , independently of all other vertices .",
    "we denote the resulting random graph by    @xmath37 .",
    "bond percolation : :    randomly delete each edge with probability @xmath36 ,    independently of all other edges .",
    "( all vertices are left . )",
    "we denote    the resulting random graph by @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath39 denotes the probability to be kept in the percolation model .",
    "when , as in our case , the original graph @xmath34 itself is random , it is further assumed that we first sample @xmath34 and then proceed as above , conditionally on @xmath34 .    the cases @xmath40 are trivial : @xmath41 , while @xmath42 , the totally empty graph with no vertices and no edges , and @xmath43 is the empty graph with the same edge set as @xmath34 but no edges .",
    "we will thus mainly consider @xmath44 .",
    "we may generalize the site percolation model by letting the probability depend on the degree of the vertex .",
    "thus , if @xmath45 is a given sequence of probabilities @xmath46}$ ] , let @xmath47 be the random graph obtained by deleting vertices independently of each other , with vertex @xmath48 deleted with probability @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the degree of @xmath51 in @xmath34 .    for simplicity and in order to concentrate on the main ideas , we will in this paper consider only the case when the probability @xmath39 ( or the sequence @xmath52 ) is fixed and thus does not depend on @xmath10 , with the exception of a few remarks where we briefly indicate how the method can be used also for a more detailed study of thresholds .",
    "the present paper is inspired by @xcite , and we follow his idea of deriving results for the percolation models @xmath53 and @xmath54 from results for the model @xmath55 without deletions , but for different degree sequences @xmath4 .",
    "we will , however , use another method to do this , which we find simpler .",
    "@xcite shows that for both site and bond percolation on @xmath6 , if we condition the resulting random graph on its degree sequence @xmath56 , and let @xmath57 be the number of its vertices , then the graph has the distribution of @xmath58 , the random graph with this degree sequence constructed by the configuration model .",
    "he then proceeds to calculate the distributions of the degree sequence @xmath56 for the two percolation models and finally applies known results to @xmath58 .",
    "our method is a version of this , where we do the deletions in two steps . for site percolation , instead of deleting a vertex , let us first _",
    "explode _ it by replacing it by @xmath59 new vertices of degree 1 , where @xmath59 is its degree ; we further colour the new vertices _",
    "red_. then clean up by removing all red vertices .",
    "note that the ( random ) explosions change the number of vertices , but not the number of half - edges .",
    "moreover , given the set of explosions , there is a one - to - one correspondence between configurations before and after the explosions , and thus , if we condition on the new degree sequence , the exploded graph is still described by the configuration model .",
    "furthermore , by symmetry , when removing the red vertices , all vertices of degree 1 are equivalent , so we may just as well remove the right number of vertices of degree 1 , but choose them uniformly at random .",
    "hence , we can obtain @xmath60 as follows :    site percolation : :    for each vertex @xmath9 , replace it with probability    @xmath36 by @xmath8 new vertices of degree    @xmath61 ( independently of all other vertices ) .",
    "let    @xmath62 be the    resulting ( random ) degree sequence , let @xmath63 be    its length ( the number of vertices ) , and let @xmath64 be    the number of new vertices . construct the random graph    @xmath65",
    ".    finish by deleting @xmath64 randomly chosen vertices of    degree @xmath61 .",
    "the more general case when we are given a sequence @xmath45 is handled in the same way :    site percolation , general : :    for each vertex @xmath9 , replace it with probability    @xmath66 by @xmath8 new vertices of degree    @xmath61 . let    @xmath67    be the resulting ( random ) degree sequence , let    @xmath63 be its length ( the number of vertices ) , and    let @xmath64 be the number of new vertices .",
    "construct the    random graph    @xmath68 .",
    "finish by deleting @xmath64 randomly chosen vertices of    degree @xmath61 .",
    "[ rfixed ] we have here assumed that vertices are deleted at random , independently of each other .",
    "this is not essential for our method , which may be further extended to the case when we remove a set of vertices determined by any random procedure that is independent of the edges in @xmath3 ( but may depend on the vertex degrees ) .",
    "for example , we may remove a fixed number @xmath69 of vertices , chosen uniformly at random .",
    "it is easily seen that if @xmath70 , the results of subsection  [ ssvertex ] below still hold ( with all @xmath71 ) , and thus the results of the later sections hold too .",
    "another , deterministic , example is to remove the first @xmath69 vertices .    for bond percolation",
    ", we instead explode each half - edge with probability @xmath72 , independently of all other half - edges ; to explode a half - edge means that we disconnect it from its vertex and transfer it to a new , red vertex of degree 1 .",
    "again this does not change the number of half - edges , and there is a one - to - one correspondence between configurations before and after the explosions .",
    "we finish by removing all red vertices and their incident edges .",
    "since an edge consists of two half - edges , and each survives with probability @xmath73 , this gives the bond percolation model @xmath54 where edges are kept with probability @xmath39 .",
    "this yields the following recipe :    bond percolation : :    replace the degrees @xmath8 in the sequence    @xmath4 by independent random degrees    @xmath74 .",
    "add @xmath75 new    degrees 1 to the sequence @xmath76 , and let    @xmath77 be the    resulting degree sequence and @xmath78 its    length .",
    "construct the random graph    @xmath79 .",
    "finish by deleting @xmath64 randomly chosen vertices of    degree @xmath61 .    in both cases",
    ", we have reduced the problem to a simple ( random ) modification of the degree sequence , plus a random removal of a set of vertices of degree 1 .",
    "the latter is often more or less trivial to handle , see the applications below .",
    "we continue to call the removed vertices red when convenient .    of course ,",
    "to use this method , it is essential to find the degree sequence @xmath80 after the explosions .",
    "we study this in section  [ sdegrees ] .",
    "we then apply this method to three different problems : _ existence of a giant component _ in the percolated graph , i.e.=1000 , what is called _ percolation _ in random graph theory ( section  [ sgiant ] ) .",
    "our results include and extend earlier work by @xcite , which inspired the present study , and some of the results by @xcite .    _ existence of a @xmath0-core _ in the percolated graph ( section  [ score ] ) .",
    "we obtain a general result analogous to ( and extending ) the well - known result by @xcite for @xmath29 .",
    "we study the phase transitions that may occur in some detail and show by examples that it is possible to have several , and even an infinite number of , different phase transitions as the probability @xmath39 increases from 0 to 1 .    _ bootstrap percolation in random regular graphs _ ( section  [ sbootstrap ] ) , where we obtain a new and simpler proof of results by @xcite . for a graph @xmath34 , let @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the numbers of vertices and edges in @xmath34 , respectively , and let @xmath83 be the number of vertices of degree @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
