    "theoretical modelling of films epitaxial growth  which is growth of an oriented single - crystal film of one material upon a single - crystal substrate of another @xcite and when the main microscopic process is particles deposition followed by their diffusion on the surface  may be grouped to continuum and discrete approaches @xcite .",
    "the continuum ones are based on the stochastic differential langevin equations @xcite which group models to the various classes of universality associated with the some set of critical exponents . in discrete approach computational methods",
    "may be applied , with _ cellular automata technique _ ( ca ) @xcite among others .",
    "the latter bases usually on the arrhenius - like kinetics @xcite and requires knowing many parameters , for instance :    * material and neighbourhood - dependent activation energies for different elementary processes , * adatom / adatom , substrate - atom / substrate - atom and substrate - atom / adatom bonds strengths , * vibration factors , * substrate temperature , * incoming particles flux , etc .",
    "usually , the values of these parameters are fitted to reproduce some experimentally measured particles and/or surface characteristics .    the title of ref .",
    "@xcite characterise the ca technique very well , as for ca , both , discrete time and space are necessary .",
    "the model must include also the rule which tells how the states of lattice cells are subsequently updated .",
    "usually , ca models for epitaxial growth simulations @xcite base on simple or even toy , mechanical rules , e.g. random deposition followed by particles relaxation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) . in the relaxation process particles",
    "often virtually move to the nearest - neighbourhoods ( nn ) sites to check offered there accommodation conditions and then chose the best one .",
    "quite often , the subsequent particle arrives to the place of its first contact with surface only when previously deposited particle migration process has been completed .",
    "such a situation corresponds to very low flux of incoming particles and does not meet real condition during molecular beam epitaxy experiments .",
    "here we would like to present simple ca which looses both : disadvantages of non - physical particles virtual movement to the nn sites and low particles flux but still does not need material dependent constants .",
    "presented here model , as usually , is extension to random deposition model ( rdm ) with additional particles relaxation .",
    "the solid - on - solid approximation is applied , so the film may be fully characterised by single - valued function @xmath8 of the film height in planar coordinates @xmath9 in time @xmath10 .",
    "we start our simulation with perfectly flat substrate .",
    "every @xmath11 time steps new jet of @xmath12 particles arrives . each time step  between subsequent acts of the depositions  particles ` sitting ' on the column top may diffuse on the surface .",
    "the only mobile particles are those which currently have less than @xmath13 and @xmath14 created particle - particle lateral bonds ( pplb ) in @xmath15- and @xmath16-direction , respectively . for isotropic case only one number @xmath0 guards the particles mobility .",
    "active particles and their movement directions are picked up randomly .",
    "the particles are not allowed to climb on higher levels , but they are able to jump down at the terrace edge . the simulation is carried out until a desired film thickness @xmath17 has been deposited .",
