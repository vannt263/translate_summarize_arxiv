    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are a class of workhorse materials in the field of semiconductor spintronics , since they combine the magnetic degree of freedom with the versatility and highly developed fabrication schemes of the semiconductor technology .",
    "usually , mn doped ii - vi or iii - v semiconductors are studied and a localized @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction between the carrier and mn spins modelled by a kondo - like hamiltonian has been found to describe the magnetic properties and the spin dynamics of dms very well .",
    "a numerical calculation based on a quantum kinetic theory ( qkt ) for the spin dynamics in dms governed by the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction@xcite showed that , among other phenomena , non - markovian effects , such as overshoots or oscillations of the total spin polarization , can be found in one- and two - dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "the quantum kinetic theory can be presented in a more easy - to - use and intuitive way , by eliminating the correlations at the cost of a memory integral .",
    "because it was found that , in doing so , it is crucial to account for a precession - like dynamics of the carrier - impurity correlations , the equations are referred to as _ precession of electron spins and correlations _ ( pesc ) equations@xcite . in the present article , we show that the non - markovian spin dynamics in dms , found in the quantum kinetic theory , can be well described by an approximation of the pesc equations",
    ". the resulting integro - differential equation can be solved by a differential transform method ( dtm)@xcite . an analysis based on this simplified approach reveals that the non - markovian effects are due to the proximity of the electronic excitations to the band edge .",
    "in ref .  @xcite effective equations of motion for the correlation - induced spin dynamics in dms were derived . for initially vanishing magnetization of the magnetic impurities ,",
    "the time evolution of the conduction band electron spin polarization in a dms quantum well structure can be found from eq .",

    "it is noteworthy that in the time derivative for the total spin , where eq .",

    "since this term can be expected to lead to an insignificant contribution to the total spin , we henceforth neglect this term which simplifies the analysis of the spin dynamics drastically . despite this argument being valid only for the total spin",

    ", @xmath16 can be evaluated at @xmath17 and drawn out of the integral . keeping in mind that @xmath18 and that the integral ranges only over one half of the @xmath19 peak , one finds : @xmath20 , which shows a simple exponential decay of @xmath3 with the rate @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to a golden rule - type transfer of the electron spin to the impurity system .",

    "for realistic parameters ( e.  g. , the parameters used in ref .",
    "@xcite yield @xmath23 mev ) and excitations far away from the end of the first brillouin zone , only the latter condition is fulfilled , while for excitations close to the band edge , @xmath13 can be of the same order of magnitude as @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we apply the markov limit ( @xmath24 ) only on the first term of eq .",

    "the number of parameters can be reduced by substituting @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "thus , the shape of the time evolution depends only on the ratio between @xmath13 and @xmath5 .",
    "we solve the integro - differtial equation  ( [ eq : idgl3 ] ) by a technique similar to zhou s differential transform method ( dtm)@xcite , which consists of taylor - expanding all terms in eq .",

    "[ fig : gauss](b ) shows the results of the dtm calculation for different values of @xmath36 . for @xmath47 ,",

    "the decay rate approaches @xmath5 and oscillations start to appear whose amplitudes eventually decrease for even larger values of @xmath36 , where the time evolution converges to the exponential decay of the markov limit @xmath48 .",

    "is employed to solve the resulting equation and allows to find closed - form expressions for low excitation energies of electrons .",
    "it is found that a non - exponential behaviour of the time evolution of the electron spin is only present for electrons excited close to the band edge , where the decay predicted by the rate and the oscillations with frequency corresponding to the electron energies take place on the same time scale . technically , this is due to the fact that a sinc - function that converges to a @xmath57-distribution in the markov limit is cut off by the band edge .",
    "it is noteworthy that similar time evolutions have also been found in different setups , e.  g. , for the hole spin dynamics due to phonon scattering in a gaas quantum well when the scattering rate is close to the phonon frequency@xcite .",
