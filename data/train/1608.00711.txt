    "over the past decade , there has been an increasing interest in the fate of the compact , massive galaxies seen at @xmath7 ( e.g.  daddi et al .",

    "2016 ) . in mid-2011 graham pointed out that these galaxies have the same physical properties as the spheroidal component of some local lenticular galaxies ( graham 2013 ) .",
    "dullo & graham ( 2013 ) further advocated that disks may have formed in and around these high-@xmath8 mass concentrations to build the local lenticular galaxies .",
    "nearly two dozen @xmath9 galaxies with massive compact spheroidal components have since been presented in graham , dullo & savorgnan ( 2015 , hereafter gds15 ; see also valentinuzzi et al .",

    "this sample included early - type galaxies in which the disk had not grown into a large - scale disk that dominates the light at large radii but was instead an intermediate - scale disk embedded within the spheroidal component of the galaxy .",
    "liller ( 1966 ) discovered such galaxies , bridging the e and s0 morphological types ( hubble 1936 ) , and she designated them _",
    "es _ galaxies .",
    "they have subsequently been referred to as `` disk ellipticals '' ( nieto et al .",
    "1988 ) and `` disky ellipticals '' ( simien & michard 1990 ; michard & marchal 1993 ; andreon et al .",
    "obviously , when a disk grows sufficiently large , the _ total _ galaxy is no longer compact even though the spheroidal component still is .",
    "such disk growth would therefore result in an apparent decrease in the number density of compact _ galaxies _ with decreasing redshift but no reduction to the actual number of the compact _ spheroids _ themselves .",
    "ngc  1277 was one such es galaxy noted in gds15  after van den bosch et al .",
    "2012 identified the galaxy as compact and massive  as was ngc  1332 ( savorgnan & graham 2016b ) , ngc  5493 ( krajnovi et al .",
    "2013 ) and ngc 5845 ( jiang et al .  2012 ) .",
    "ngc  1271 is another nearby , compact early - type galaxy ( brunzendorf & meusinger 1999 ) that contains a nearly edge - on , intermediate - scale disk .",
    "it was first recognized as having an unusually small half - light radius for its luminosity in the catalog of strom & strom ( 1978 ) , with such galaxies labelled as ` compact galaxies ' as far back as zwicky & kowal ( 1968 ) and zwicky & zwicky ( 1971 ) .",
    "galaxies with intermediate - scale disks can be more akin to the spheroidal component of lenticular galaxies that acquired large - scale disks than they are to complete lenticular galaxies .",
    "as noted above , although such intermediate - scale disks are not unusual , they may be somewhat unfamiliar to readers more versed with the bulge / disk structure of spiral and lenticular galaxies .",
    "the spheroidal stellar component of spiral galaxies presents itself as a central bulge encased within a disk : that is , the spheroid does not dominate the light at large radii  as noted by the warning in figure  7 from graham 2001 ) .",
    "however , early - type galaxies _ can _ have spheroidal components which dominate the galaxy light at both inner and outer radii .",
    "this situation can arise when a disk has not grown large enough to dominate the light at large radii .",
    "galaxies in clusters may well be particularly prone to this situation due to ram pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ) removing their disk - building gas supply , and `` strangulation '' ( larson et al .",
    "1980 ; bekki et al .",
    "2002 )  which also operates in galaxy groups ( kawata & mulchaey 2008 )  cutting off their gas supply .",
    "this may contribute to the compact massive galaxies found in clusters by the wide - field nearby galaxy - cluster survey ( wings ) collaboration ( e.g.  valentinuzzi et al .",
    "2010a ; see also nantais et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "careful bulge / disk decompositions are required if one is to avoid comparing ` apples and oranges ' and subsequently misinterpreting systematic offsets in various parameter scaling diagrams .",
    "for example , it is not appropriate to consider such small disks as the ` bulge ' component of a galaxy , nor to consider only the inner portion of the spheroidal component ( where its light produces a central bulge in the radial light profile above the intermediate - scale disk ) as the complete spheroidal component of a galaxy , nor to confuse the inner portion of the spheroid as an encased bulge surrounded by a disk plus a separate envelope that is actually the outer portion of the spheroid .",
    "considering the ` bulge ' component of a galaxy to be the smallest - sized component in their multiple srsic model descriptions of ngc  1271 , walsh et al .",
    "( 2015 ; hereafter w2015 ) derived a bulge mass for ngc  1271 of @xmath10 .",
    "this was the midpoint of their two estimates ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) obtained by fitting 2 and then 3 srsic components to the galaxy image .",
    "their uncertainty as to the actual spheroidal component of this galaxy led them to adopt the average mass from the smallest - sized component of both decompositions , which they then used in the near - linear @xmath5@xmath13 relation from kormendy & ho ( 2013 ) to predict a central black hole mass that was an order of magnitude lower than their directly measured black hole mass of @xmath14 .",
    "that is , they reported the detection of an `` over - massive '' black hole in ngc  1271 relative to its bulge ( their figure  10 ) . from this , they concluded that there could be systematic differences in the black hole scaling relations between compact massive galaxies ( i.e.  spheroids with intermediate - scale disks such as ngc  1271 and ngc  1277 ) and the other spheroids which have been used to construct the ( black hole)(host spheroid ) mass scaling relation , i.e.  the spheroidal component of : galaxies with larger - scale disks ; normal elliptical galaxies ; and brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "w2015 went on to remark that a difference in the black hole scaling relations implies a different growth path , i.e.  evolution , for black holes in such galaxies ( see also ferr - mateu et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "given that the above interpretation effectively rests on the mass of the black hole predicted from the stellar mass of the host spheroid , in section  [ sec_intro ] we perform a spheroid / disk decomposition of ngc  1271 to independently determine the mass of its spheroidal component , and then predict the mass of its central black hole using the latest @xmath15@xmath16 relation@xmath17 relation , from dressler ( 1989 ) and yee ( 1992 ) up until the bent relation in graham & scott ( 2015 ; see also the models by lu & mo 2015 and fontanot , monaco & shankar 2015 ) .",
    "in addition to describing the @xmath5@xmath16 relation , graham ( 2016 ) contains an extensive bibliography to explain how and why we came to believe in ( super - massive ) black holes . ] .",
    "in addition to the surface brightness profile , we use both the ellipticity profile and the `` disky / boxy '' @xmath18 profile  which quantifies the deviations of the isophotes from ellipses ( carter 1978 , 1979 , 1987 ; jedrzejewski 1987 ; bender & mllenhoff 1987 ; ebneter et al .",
    "1988 ; bender 1988 ; bijaoui et al .  1989 )",
    " to reveal the radial extent of the disk in ngc  1271 .",
    "we do so using the routine described in ciambur ( 2015 ) , which improves upon the prescription used in the popular iraf task ellipse ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) .",
    "we show that the disk resides wholly within the spheroidal component of ngc  1271 which dominates the light at large radii .",
    "our analysis results in a larger spheroid mass and thus a lower ( black hole)-to - spheroid mass ratio than was recently highlighted by w2015 . in section  [ sec_disc ] we discuss this result , placing ngc  1271 in the @xmath5@xmath16 diagram , and we additionally reveal that the compact spheroidal component of ngc  1271 is also not an outlier in either the mass - size or the mass - density diagram .",
    "we go on to discuss the evolution , or lack thereof , of compact massive spheroids , and also reveal how es galaxies relate to other galaxies in a familiar classification diagram involving the spheroid - to - disk flux ratio and galaxy morphological type .",
    "our main conclusions are briefly presented in section  [ sec_conc ] .",
    "following w2015 , we adopt their perseus galaxy cluster ( abell 426 ) distance of 80 mpc to ngc  1271 .",
    "together with their use of @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , this gives a hubble expansion redshift @xmath23 and a scale of 379 parsec per arcsecond ( wright 2006 ) .",
    "we have used an archived _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) image taken with the _ wide field camera 3 _ ( _ wfc3 _ ) and the near - infrared _ f160w _ filter .",
    "this image is a distortion corrected _ pydrizzle _ output , obtained from the combination of 2 individual exposures , with a total integration time of @xmath24 seconds and a pixel size of @xmath25 .",
    "we manually checked that the background subtraction had been correctly performed , and built a mask for the contaminating sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows a cutout of ngc  1271 from the larger image , and our mask .",
    "ngc  1271 can be seen to contain a nearly edge - on , stellar disk .",
    "while nearly edge - on , _ large - scale _ disks result in early - type galaxy isophotes becoming increasingly elongated at large radii , embedded _ intermediate - scale _ disks do not . instead , the outer isophotes become rounder ( reflecting the ellipticity of the galaxy s spheroidal component ) as the influence of the disk diminishes at larger radii .",
    "we performed an isophotal analysis of ngc  1271 using the task isofit ( ciambur 2015 ) , which fit quasi - elliptical isophotes to the galaxy image .",
    "isofit is a modified version of the iraf task ellipse ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) , and is much more capable of modeling features such as diskyness , which is particularly relevant in the case of ngc  1271 .",
    "the isofit task generates a major - axis light profile along with all the associated terms that describe the shape of each isophote and enable one to construct an accurate 2d galaxy model , with the position angle profile , the ellipticity profile , and the fourier harmonic terms describing the deviations from pure elliptical isophotes at each radius .",
    "our reconstructed image of ngc  1271 can be seen in the middle panel of figure  [ fig:1d - b ] .",
    "as the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig:1d - b ] reveals , this reconstruction provides a clean representation of the galaxy , which is then suitable for analysis through the fitting of galaxy components .",
    "the major - axis surface brightness profile was additionally mapped to the so - called ` equivalent - axis ' , i.e.  the geometric mean of the major ( @xmath26 ) and minor ( @xmath27 ) axis ( @xmath28 ) , which is equivalent to the radius of the ` circularized ' isophotes .",
    "this axis is such that if the area interior to each isophote was enclosed by a circle , then the radius of that circle is associated with the surface brightness of the isophote . with the equivalent - axis light profile one",
    "can then use spherical geometry for the purposes of calculating the integrated surface brightness , i.e.  the magnitude . both the major - axis and the equivalent - axis surface brightness profiles ( in the vega system )",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig:1d ] .",
    "the one - dimensional point spread function ( psf ) was characterized using the iraf task imexamine . by fitting a gaussian function to the radial intensity profiles of 12 bright stars in the image , we measured the ` full width at half maximum ' ( fwhm ) and obtained an average value of 0.24 arcsec .",
    "we then performed a galaxy decomposition with the profiler software ( ciambur 2016 ) .",
    "in essence , at each iteration in the fitting process , a two - component ( spheroid @xmath29 disk ) model was constructed and convolved with a gaussian function to replicate the `` seeing '' ( psf ) effects in the data , and then matched to the data over the inner @xmath30 .",
    "while a core - srsic profile ( graham et al .",
    "2003 ) is expected for the spheroidal component of ngc  1271 ( see graham & scott 2013 ) given its high central velocity dispersion , it does not appear to have a depleted core .",
    "ngc  1277 is another galaxy with a high central velocity dispersion and no partially - depleted core ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2012 ; graham et al .",
    "indeed , rather than a deficit of stars at its core , ngc  1277 contains an additional nuclear component .",
    "dullo & graham ( 2014 , their section  3.4 ) provide a discussion of why , when modeling the distribution of light in galaxies , one should not simply arbitrarily add components until they are satisfied with the amplitude of the ( data@xmath31model ) residuals .",
    "several examples of where this has led to questionable results are provided there .",
    "the srsic ( 1963 ) @xmath32 function that we used here has previously been described in caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and graham & driver ( 2005 ) , and we used a standard exponential disk model for the equivalent - axis light profile , such that the intensity @xmath33 .",
    "the major - axis light profile , for which the disk dominates from @xmath343 to @xmath3420 arcseconds , required the edge - on disk model ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ) , which is such that the intensity @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a radial scale and @xmath37 is a modified first - order bessel function .",
    "unlike with the exponential model , @xmath36 is not the radius where the disk intensity has dropped by a factor of e ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the results of fitting the above models are shown in figure  [ fig:1d ] , which additionally reveals the humped ellipticity profile ( and the fourth harmonic profile : positive @xmath18 equals disky , negative @xmath18 equals boxy ) that is characteristic of the embedded disks of es galaxies ( liller 1966 ) .",
    "the goodness of the fit is measured by the quantity @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of data points and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the number of model parameters involved ( 2 disk and 3 spheroid ) .",
    "the magnitudes , luminosities and ultimately stellar masses ( see section  [ subsec_par ] ) of the spheroid and the embedded disk were derived from the equivalent - axis light profile , as discussed above and detailed in the appendix of ciambur ( 2015 ) .",
    "these values are provided in table  1 .",
    "given that disks have a typical thickness , i.e.  ratio of vertical scale - height to radial scale - length of 0.200.25 ( e.g.  sandage , freeman & stokes 1970 ; bizyaev et al .",
    "2014 , their figure  4 ) , we can expect the equivalent axis of a near edge - on disk to have an exponential scale - length equal to @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( 0.45 to 0.5 ) times that of the major - axis exponential scale - length .",
    "the exponential disk model shown in the left hand panel of figure  [ fig:1d ] has a scale - length of @xmath45 , while the edge - on disk model shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ fig:1d ] has dropped in intensity by a factor of e from its central value by the radius @xmath46 , giving a minor - to - major axis ratio of @xmath47 .",
    "we note that the disk is likely to be more complicated than assumed in our models .",
    "for instance , at around @xmath48 , the radial intensity profile of the disk may truncate or break to a more rapid rate of decline ( see the right hand panel of figure  [ fig:1d ] ) .",
    "in addition , the double hump in the @xmath18 profile at @xmath49 and @xmath50 is suggestive of another component .",
    "there may be a bar or an inner ring in addition to the intermediate - scale disk .",
    "furthermore , the disk component of the equivalent - axis light profile is probably only approximately described by the exponential model given the edge - on nature of the disk .",
    "we trialed many variations , such as fitting equation  [ eq - edge ] , and fitting the expression appropriate for the minor - axis light profile of the edge - on disk model ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ) , and locking the central surface brightness to exactly match the value derived from the the fit to the major - axis light profile , plus locking the scale - length to 0.45 times the asymptotic value seen at large radii in the fit to the major - axis light profile ( right hand panel of figure  [ fig:1d ] ) where , admittedly , the disk s `` light profile '' shape is not well constrained .",
    "not surprisingly , none of these variations had a large impact on the derived spheroid magnitude ; the greatest departure was just 0.15 mag .",
    "we therefore conclude that refinements to the disk model will not have a large impact on the spheroid magnitude .",
    "we additionally tested the robustness of our decomposition results to the psf characterization by using a range of fwhm between @xmath51 ",
    "@xmath52 ( the values reported in the literature , e.g.  cassata et al .",
    "2010 ; windhorst et al .",
    "we found this changed the model parameters very little : the variation in estimated bulge magnitude was within 0.01 mag , while the srsic index along the major - axis varied by just 0.02 .",
    "we additionally performed a 2d image decomposition using the software galfit3 ( peng et al .",
    "we obtained an image of the psf from the tinytim software ( krist , hook & stoehr 2011 ; biretta 2014 ) . however because this psf is narrower than the `` real '' stars in our image , we built a broader psf image by convolving a 2d gaussian profile with the psf image from tinytim .",
    "the advantage of this method ( c.peng , private communication ) is to obtain a 2d psf that is wider than the tinytim psf , but maintains the asymmetric features of the tinytim psf ( e.g.  wings and spikes ) .",
    "we modeled the galaxy with a srsic component for the spheroid and an exponential function for the disk .",
    "the minor - to - major axis ratio for the fitted disk model was equal to 0.22 .",
    "as noted above , this is basically equal to the typical thickness of galaxy discs , i.e.  the ( vertical scale - height)-to-(radial scale - length ) ratio observed in edge - on discs .",
    "we note that using a srsic model for the edge - on disk , rather than an exponential model , had no significant impact on the results ( figure  [ fig:2d ] and table  1 ) .",
    "our 2d analysis is similar to the 2-component fit reported in table  4 of w2015 , in that the disk component has similar parameters . while we also both report a srsic index @xmath346 for the more massive component ,",
    "w2015 obtain notably more elongation from their fit , such that they report an axis ratio of 0.54 for their srsic model , compared to our value of 0.69 , and they report a major - axis half - light radius of @xmath53 for the spheroid compared to our value of 3@xmath54.08 .",
    "an axis ratio of 0.54 is too low to match the outermost ellipse drawn in figure  1 of w2015 , which approximates the isophote at @xmath55 and has an axis ratio of 0.65 .    the rigidity of the 2d model s components ( i.e.  the constant position angle and ellipticity of the spheroid and disk ) , and the treatment of the diskyness , meant that our 2d model was not able to fully reproduce the galaxy light in the way that the 1d analysis did .",
    "this is evident in the residual image seen in the right hand panel of figure  [ fig:2d ] , which can be contrasted with the right hand panel of figure  [ fig:1d - b ] . despite the better result using the 1d approach ,",
    "the difference in the magnitude for both the spheroid and the disk is not more than 0.3 mag when using the 2d approach .",
    "more specifically , the 2d model results in a spheroid that is just 22% fainter ( see table  1 ) . given that the 1d light profile is constructed by fully capturing the galaxy light ( see figure  [ fig:1d - b ] ) , while also accounting for deviations from elliptical isophotes in terms of fourier harmonics , this is our preferred analysis for the estimate of the spheroid brightness .",
    "fitting the 1d light profile , within the inner 30@xmath54 , the difference between our 2-component spheroid@xmath29disk model and the data is less than 0.15 mag arcsec@xmath56 , while the average difference is less than 0.04 mag arcsec@xmath56 ( figure  [ fig:1d ] ) .",

    "one could however ignore this morphological type information and instead use bulge - to - total ratio as one axis , with additional markers indicating if the galaxy has a strong or weak or no bar , or has a strong or anaemic or no spiral pattern .",

    "some early - type galaxies have not managed to grow their disks into the more easily identified large - scale disks seen in many lenticular galaxies . when this happens , the spheroidal component of these es galaxies remains larger than their disk component , and thus the spheroid not only appears as a central `` bulge '' but it also dominates the light at large radii . having modeled the distribution of light in ngc  1271 with an embedded intermediate - scale disk ( figure  [ fig:1d - b ] and the upper panels of figure  [ fig:1d ] , see also figure  [ fig:2d ] ) , we report that the full spheroid stellar mass in ngc  1271 is @xmath140 , greater than that adopted by w2015 ( @xmath10 ) .",
