    "colloids and molecules with anisotropic shapes and interactions play a significant role in condensed matter physics , specially in the design of self - assembled structures  @xcite .",
    "particularly , janus colloids are characterized as particles composed by at least two physically or chemically distinctive surfaces .",
    "they can have different shapes , as rods , spheres and dumbbells .",
    "these systems have a large range of applications including medicine , self - driven molecules , catalysis , photonic crystals , stable emulsions , biomolecules and self - healing materials@xcite .    from the distinct janus particles shapes , janus dumbbells@xcite are colloids formed by two spheres , each one with distinct characteristics linked together with a separation that varies from an almost total overlap to one or two monomer diameters .",
    "due to the resemblance between janus particles and competing interaction systems , janus dumbbells behave as surfactant in water - based emulsions due its amphiphilic properties  @xcite .",
    "self - assembly lamellae or micellae phases were observed on these systems due the competition between attractive and repulsive forces @xcite .",
    "recent studies reported the production of silver - silicon ( ag - si)@xcite and silica - polystyrene ( sio@xmath0-ps)@xcite janus dimers .",
    "silica and silicon are classified as anomalous fluids , and therefore have a set of properties that diverge from the observed for regular materials . for most part of the fluids ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient decreases when the pressure ( or density ) increases .",
    "however , materials as water  @xcite , silicon  @xcite and silica  @xcite show diffusion anomaly , characterized by a maximum in the diffusion coefficient at constant temperature .",
    "besides diffusion ( or dynamical ) anomaly , water , silicon , silica and others fluids , the so - called anomalous fluids , also have other classes of anomalies , as structure and thermodynamic anomalies .",
    "particularly , the density anomaly is characterized by the increase of density with the temperature at a fixed pressure .",
    "distinct computational models were proposed to study the anomalous behavior of fluids . among these models , effective two length scale ( tls ) core - softened shoulder potential are an interesting tool to investigate systems with water - like anomalies .",
    "particularly , the model proposed by oliveira   _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite reproduces qualitatively the diffusion , structural and thermodynamic anomalies , and was broadly used to study anomalous systems .",
    "this effective approach to describe anomalous fluids was used to study monomeric and dimeric systems of anomalous particles  @xcite .",
    "the tls potential was used in our previous works to study the behavior of janus dumbbells composed of one anomalous and one non - anomalous monomers in bulk  @xcite . despite the presence of the non - anomalous monomer ,",
    "the diffusion anomaly was preserved .",
    "confinement was proposed as a approach to tune the self - assembled morphologies . controlling the confinement intensity it is possible to create micelles with distinct shapes .",
    "computational and experimental studies have already explore the confinement effects if the self assembly of polyhedral nanoparticles  @xcite , patchy spherical colloids  @xcite , asymmetric and symmetric dumbbells  @xcite surfactants and polymers  @xcite .",
    "as well , the confinement affects the diffusivity of spherical janus swimmers  @xcite .",
    "in fact , confinement strongly affects the behavior of fluids in general . for the case of anomalous fluids  @xcite ,",
    "new anomalies can be observed due confinement  @xcite , and even a superdiffusive regime can be induced  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous region in the pressure @xmath1 temperature ( @xmath2 ) phase diagram is usually shifted due confinement .",
    "this shift can be to higher or lower temperatures , regarding on the nature of the fluid - wall interaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question that rises is how the confinement will affect not only the self - assembled structures , but the dynamical and thermodynamical behavior of the anomalous / non - anomalous janus dumbbell system . in this way",
    ", we perform intensive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of janus nanoparticles composed of anomalous and non - anomalous monomers confined between two flat plates .",
    "in addition to the myriad of structures tuned by the confinement , we show how the confinement and the tls potential lead the system to have not only diffusion anomaly , but also the density anomaly , not observed in bulk .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we introduce the model and describe the methods and simulation details ; next the results and discussion are given ; and then we present our conclusions .",
    "in this paper all physical quantities are computed in the standard lennard jones ( lj ) units@xcite ,    @xmath3    for distance , density of particles and time , respectively , and    @xmath4    for the pressure and temperature , respectively , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the distance , energy and mass parameters , respectively . since all physical quantities are defined in reduced lj units , the @xmath8 is omitted , in order to simplify the discussion .",

    "we performed @xmath41 steps to equilibrate the system .",
    "these steps are then followed by @xmath42 steps for the results production stage . to ensure that the system was equilibrated , the pressure , kinetic energy and potential energy were analyzed as function of time , as well several snapshots at distinct simulation times . since confined systems can be sensitive to the number of particles in the simulation , in some points we carried out simulations with 5000 and 10000 particles , and essentially the same results were observed .",
    "as well , we run some points with a production time of @xmath43 to test if the system was well equilibrated , and the same results were obtained .",

    ". we can establish a relation between @xmath80 and the type of aggregates .",
    "for @xmath81 , @xmath80 varies between 4 and 5 . analyzing the system snapshots , for these densities we can see a coexistence of trimeric , tetrahedral and hexahedral clusters . as @xmath82 increases , more hexahedral aggregates and less trimeric aggregates",
    "are observed in the solution .",
    "this region , with the coexistence of trimeric , tetrahedral and hexahedral clusters was labeled as region i in the figure  [ fig3 ] . for the densities inside the region ii",

    "all these previous aggregates where observed in the bulk simulation , with a similar @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "however , the confinement frustrates the self - assembly as the density increases .",
    "therefore , if for lower densities the system aggregates in the same micelles observed for the bulk case , for higher densities new kinds of self - assembled aggregates should be induced by the confinement . in this way",
    ", the spherical and elongated micelles can have a higher @xmath80 compared to the bulk case .",
    "basically , the limited space induced by the confinement leads two or more smaller micelles to merge in a large cluster .",
    "this region , with spherical and elongated micelles formed by more nanoparticles than the observed in bulk was labeled region v. the size of the micelles grows continually up to @xmath83 for @xmath78 , with approximately 10 aggregates with 100 nanoparticles each , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , and above this threshold all the particles aggregate in a lamellae structure , region vi - a of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "for the temperature @xmath78 and @xmath84 , the rippled lamellae is disoriented , without a preferable direction , as we shown in figure  [ fig2](viii ) . however , for some values of temperatures and densities , as @xmath85 and @xmath86 to @xmath87 , the lamellar phase has a directional ordering , as we shown in figure  [ fig2](ix ) .",
    "the region where we observe the oriented rippled lamellae was labeled vi - b .",
    "these lamellar structures , usually observed in amphiphilic molecules as in janus particles  @xcite , where not observed in bulk for our model of janus nanoparticles . therefore , this new structure is induced by the geometrical confinement . while in bulk the particles do not have any geometrical restriction , remaining in the micellae phase when the density is up to @xmath31  @xcite , the confinement , associated to a high density , leads the dumbbells to aggregate in the lammelar cluster .",
    "the time evolution of the distinct lamellar phases is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] . for lower temperatures ,",
    "the entropic contribution to the free energy is not sufficient to change the initial configuration and the lamellae structure do not change with time , remaining disoriented , as shown in figure  [ fig4](a ) .",
    "however , for higher temperatures , the initially disordered configuration changes to the oriented rippled structure , as we can see in figure  [ fig4](b ) .",

    "the distinct micellae and lamellae regions discussed in the previous figures are indicated .",
    "the dashed gray lines are the isochores .",
    "the density anomalous regions is defined by the tmd line , and the diffusion anomaly region by the lines of maxima and minima diffusion.,width=302 ]    in the figure  [ fig5 ] we show the qualitative @xmath92 phase diagram for the confined system .",
    "the distinct micellae and lamellae regions are indicated .",
    "as discussed previously , new self - assembled structures are induced by the confinement . however",
    ", the aggregation region does not shift to higher or lower temperatures .",
    "curiously , at the temperatures were we observe the oriented lamellae structure , for densities above @xmath93 the system have not a well defined micellar structure , and an amorphous phase is observed .",
    "this phase is a fluid with small diffusion . taking the isotherm @xmath85 as reference , the pressure drops when @xmath94 and the system shows a reentrant fluid region .",
    "the plot of parallel diffusion coefficient as function of density for some values of @xmath95 is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "as we can see that for @xmath85 the system have @xmath96 for @xmath86 , 0.40 and 0.425 , and @xmath49 grows when @xmath97 , indicating a melting .",
    "the lrdf , showed in figure  [ fig7 ] , also shows a decrease in the system structure , from the well structured lamellar phase to the fluid phase .",
    "this melting induced by the increase of density was already observed in colloidal glasses systems  @xcite , but was not observed in our bulk system .",
    "the fluid phase also shows interesting properties , distinct from the bulk case .",
    "the first one is the density anomaly .",
    "as we can see , the isochores in figure  [ fig5 ] show a minimum .",
    "the dashed blue line , the so called tmd line , connects these minimum points .",
    "the density anomaly was observed for pure anomalous monomer and dimers ( aa dimers )  @xcite , however was not present in the bulk janus system  @xcite .",
    "the reentrant region , that occurs at higher densities , is located where the tmd line ends and splits the lammelar phase vi - b in two regions .",
    "as function of density @xmath82 for different temperatures .",
    "the red lines indicate the minima and maxima in the diffusion coefficient.,width=302 ]     for @xmath85 , showing the melting induced by the density increase.,width=302 ]    the bulk system has only diffusion anomaly , and it is preserved in the confined case .",
    "however , the diffusion extrema line for the confined system , defined by the red dot - dashed red line in the phase diagram , figure  [ fig5 ] , have a temperature range larger than in bulk .",
    "studies for confined anomalous fluids indicate that the tmd moves to lower temperatures for solvophobic confinement and higher temperatures for solvophilic confinement  @xcite . for the bulk case ,",
    "our hypothesis was that the tmd line was absorbed by the micellae region . hence , since our confinement is solvophobic ( the wca potential is purely repulsive ) , is surprising that the tmd appears , moving to higher temperatures .",
    "this leads to the question : why the anomalies lines are shifted to higher temperatures ?",
    "gavazzoni and co - authors  @xcite showed that the anisotropy can shift the solid - fluid phase boundary of dumbbells systems made only by a monomers .",
    "more than this , the work argues that the kinetic energy and , therefore , the temperature , has two contribution : the translational temperature and the non - translational temperature .",
    "hence , the contribution from the dimer rotations to the kinetic energy plays a significant role in this system behavior . in bulk",
    ", our janus dumbbell can rotate freely in any direction - the only limitation are collisions with others dimers .",
    "however , the confinement imposes a constriction to the system . in our strongly confined system , with @xmath32 and @xmath98 , not only the translation in @xmath27-direction is limited , but the combination of confinement with the competing interactions of janus systems lead to a interesting phenomena . as the figure  [ fig6 ] shows , the diffusion coefficient is distinct from zero  so , the particles are moving in the parallel direction . in the figure  [ fig8](i )",
    "we show a frontal snapshot of the nanoparticles arrangement .",
    "as we can see , the particles are disordered - as expected for fluids .",
    "notwithstanding , the side snapshot shows that in the @xmath27-direction the particles have a preferential position : the attractive b particles stay at the center , and the repulsive a particles are near the wall .",
    "then , due the confinement and the janus characteristics , the dimers are translating in the @xmath99-plane , but without rotation .",
    "this places the a monomers side by side in the @xmath99-plane , with a internal layer of attractive b monomers .",
    "this internal layer will act similar to a solvophilic wall , with the b monomers pulling one another . as consequence ,",
    "the behavior is similar to water in hydrophilic confinement , and the anomalous region shifts to higher temperatures .     and",
    "we report the study of confined janus nanoparticles .",
    "this system has special interest in the design of new material using the confinement to control the self - assembled structures .",
    "we have found a rich variety of aggregates and micelles , including large micelles not observed in the bulk system . as well , two lamellae phases , with distinct orientations , where induced by the confinement .",
    "the oriented lamellae phase region in the @xmath101 phase diagram is splitted by a reentrant fluid phase .",
    "this melting , induced by increasing the density , was not present in the bulk system as well .",
    "another feature that was not observed in the bulk system is the density anomaly .",
    "the combination of confinement effects with the competing interactions of janus dimers shifts the tmd line to higher temperatures , rising the anomaly that was hide inside the aggregation region for the bulk case . as well , the diffusion anomaly region increases , reaching higher temperatures .",
    "our results show that materials composed by the association of a monomer which can be modeled by a two length scale potential and a standard lj monomer have an interesting and peculiar behavior .",
