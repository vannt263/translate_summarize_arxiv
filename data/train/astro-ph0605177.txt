    "asteroseismology is the study of the oscillations of the stars .",
    "it is the only method which allows us to _ see _ beyond the photosphere of a star , and learn about their interior conditions .",
    "we are interested in @xmath0 scuti stars , whose pulsation amplitudes are large enough to be detected from the earth .",
    "however , they present a physical problem : not all of the oscillation modes that theory predicts are excited nor observed , which leads to various interpretations of the frequency spectra and thus a poorly - constrained solution ( mass , age etc . ) .",
    "if we study @xmath0 scuti stars in eclipsing binary systems we could accurately derive their stellar masses and radii .",
    "then we could constrain some of the parameters of the system . this in turn would lead to an easier identification of the modes of the stars , allowing us to better determine the real parameters of the system . combining",
    "information from these different sources has been suggested by many authors , and some studies have been conducted with this in mind @xcite . in fact , they agree that this is the only way to advance if we would like to test stellar structure and evolution theories .    following a technique similar to that conducted by @xcite , we would like to investigate how the combination of information from the study of binary systems with oscillation frequencies constrains the solution parameters . in particular we would like to understand by how much each observable ( radial velocities , oscillation modes etc . ) influences each of the parameters of the system ( mass , age etc ) . to approach this problem we use the technique of singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite and apply it to a simple case of a detached eclipsing binary system .",

    "for a more detailed discussion we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 be the observables of some system , and @xmath20 with @xmath21 be the variables ( parameters ) that define this system .",
    "there exists some model or list of equations that when given @xmath1 , will result in @xmath22 . in real situations we know @xmath22 and we would like to extract @xmath1 . if the system or model were linear , this would be achieved relatively easy by solving a system of m linear equations in n variables .",
    "however , normally this is not the case , and so by linearizing the system around a reference set of parameters , @xmath23 , we can write @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the observables resulting from the initial parameter estimates @xmath23 , @xmath26 and each of the derivatives , @xmath27 is evaluated at @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter fitting problem involves finding @xmath29 .",
    "given the real observables @xmath30 and after some substituting our problem is mathematically equivalent to minimizing @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33    the solution is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the singular value decomposition of @xmath36 .",
    "it is precisely this decomposition that provides us with information regarding the origin of the errors in the parameter solutions . in the absence of the real observables",
    "@xmath30 we can still construct the derivative matrix @xmath36 to study the transformation between the observable and the parameter space .",
    "given photometric and radial velocity measurements of a detached eclipsing spectroscopic binary system , we would like to obtain the following fundamental parameters : masses of both components @xmath15  and @xmath17 , radii of both stars @xmath3  and @xmath7 , effective temperature ratio @xmath37/@xmath38 , inclination of system @xmath9 and separation of both components @xmath39 . in order to obtain these parameters we need the following observables : @xmath5  and @xmath8  are the semi - amplitudes of the radial velocity curve . from the photometric light curve we obtain the primary eclipse depth d@xmath11 and with the secondary @xmath40 , a depth ratio d@xmath18/d@xmath11 .",
    "we also observe a total duration of eclipse @xmath41 , and a duration of eclipse minimum , @xmath42 ( see assumptions below ) .",
    "the photometric period @xmath43 is obtained from long term observations .",
    "let us also assume for simplicity that there is no eccentricity @xmath44 , that neither of the components have stellar spots , that the secondary eclipse is total and that both stars are well isolated such that there is no mass transfer between them .",
    "the _ model _ that relates these given observables to the parameters is a set of equations that can be easily derived . after obtaining observations with errors",
    "@xmath2 , we make some initial parameter estimates @xmath23 ( table 1 )",
    ". we can then calculate the matrix @xmath36 ( equation [ eqn : matrix ] ) .",
    "using svd , we decompose @xmath36 to obtain its singular values and its corresponding orthogonal matrices .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1creevey1 ] shows the first three solution vectors ( left panel ) and observable vectors ( center panel ) of @xmath36 .",
    "the vector corresponding to the largest singular value ( smallest error ) is the top solution vector . according to the figure ,",
    "the best - constrained parameter is the separation between both components ( left panel , top row vector ) .",
    "there is also a small effect from this singular value on both masses .",
    "if we inspect the observable vector ( center panel , top row vector ) , we can see clearly that @xmath43 is the most reliable observation ( corresponding to the largest singular value ) .",
    "we know that @xmath43 is directly related to @xmath39 and @xmath45 through kepler s law giving a well - determined @xmath39 . in this case @xmath15 and @xmath17 are mainly constrained by the radial velocity measurements ( left and center panel , bottom row vector ) .    the second solution vector shows that both @xmath41 and @xmath42 are also some of the more important observables in constraining the solution . figure",
    "[ fig : fig1creevey1 ] left panel shows that both @xmath3 and @xmath7 correspond to this singular value , implying that @xmath42 and @xmath41 are mainly responsible for the reduction in the errors of both radii .",
    "in fact , @xmath42 and @xmath41 contribute also to @xmath9 but to a lesser extent ( sixth singular value ) .",
    "suppose now that the errors in our measurements ( @xmath46 ) were to decrease by a factor of 2 . by decreasing each of the @xmath46 individually",
    ", we may investigate how each of the errors on the parameters ( @xmath47 ) improves ( noting that combining all @xmath46 should result in a corresponding reduction of 0.5 in all the @xmath47 ) .",
    "figure 1 right panel indicates the decrease in each @xmath47 as a fraction of the original error ( @xmath48 , where @xmath49 comes from the covariance matrix ( press et al .",
    "1986 ) , and @xmath50 represents @xmath49 given the original @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the resulting @xmath49 given a decrease in a particular @xmath46 .",
    "we show the effects of reducing just @xmath53 ( solid ) and @xmath54 ( dash ) .",
    "the new @xmath53 is solely responsible for the reduction of both @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( a total of 0.5 ) . if we were interested in improving the errors on both radii",
    ", then we know from this that we need only improve the precision of @xmath57 ( note with @xmath58 @xmath42 and @xmath41 were important for @xmath3 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath54 is responsible for all of the reduction of @xmath59 .",
    "however , @xmath54 is also _ partially _ responsible for reducing both @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( by 0.2 and 0.1 respectively ) .",
    "this indicates that if we were interested in improving the precision of @xmath15 , we would need not only an improvement of @xmath54 , but a combination of improved @xmath46 ( in this case @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 )",
    ". we should also take into account the actual values of the errors , for example , if @xmath60 improves from 0.004 to 0.002 @xmath65 ( which is this case ) , we could also conclude that these observations may not be worthwhile .",
    "so we must look at these results cautiously , and we must also emphasize the sensitivity of these results to @xmath58 .",
    "if we could decrease each @xmath46 by 3 , 4 , 5 ... times , we could determine at what error level this observable becomes important in constraining a particular parameter , given all the other @xmath2 .",
    "this could indicate if it were worthwhile obtaining better observations .",
    "it may also help determine the precision of our observations necessary to obtain a solution to the system with errors to within a certain % .",
    "studying the transformation between parameter and observable space may allow us to reach these conclusions .",
    "what we have discussed is just a simple example to illustrate what we would like to achieve in the case of a more complicated system , such as a detached eclipsing binary system where one of the components is a @xmath0 scuti star .",
    "unfortunately , for that case we can not write simple equations to relate the observables to the parameters , and for this reason a study such as this one is beneficial .",
    "we saw briefly the capacity of svd to try to explain the relationship between the errors in each of the observables to the errors in each of the parameters .",
    "we saw how the effect of an increase in the precision of the observables can impact in a rather complex form on the resulting errors of the parameters .",
    "ideally we would like to observe a real eclipsing system with a @xmath0 scuti component . from studying this transformation",
    "we hope to be able to optimise our observations to obtain the best constrained parameters .",
    "doing this would allow us to _ solve _ this system to the required precision in order to test theories of stellar structure ."
