    "the organizers of this conference asked me to review the early history of gauge theories . because of",
    "space and time limitations i shall concentrate on weyl s seminal papers of 1918 and 1929 .",
    "important contributions by fock , klein and others , based on kaluza s five - dimensional unification attempt , will not be discussed .",
    "( for this i refer to @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the history of gauge theories begins with gr , which can be regarded as a non - abelian gauge theory of a special type . to a large extent",
    "the other gauge theories emerged in a slow and complicated process gradually from gr .",
    "their common geometrical structure  best expressed in terms of connections of fiber bundles  is now widely recognized .",
    "it all began with h. weyl @xcite who made in 1918 the first attempt to extend gr in order to describe gravitation and electromagnetism within a unifying geometrical framework .",
    "this brilliant proposal contains the germs of all mathematical aspects of non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the word ` gauge ' ( german : ` eich- ' ) transformation appeared for the first time in this paper , but in the everyday meaning of change of length or change of calibration .",
    "einstein admired weyl s theory as `` a coup of genius of the first rate '' , but immediately realized that it was physically untenable .",
    "after a long discussion weyl finally admitted that his attempt was a failure as a physical theory .",
    "( for a discussion of the intense einstein - weyl correspondence , see ref .",
    "it paved , however , the way for the correct understanding of gauge invariance . weyl himself reinterpreted in 1929 his original theory after the advent of quantum theory in a grand paper @xcite .",
    "weyl s reinterpretation of his earlier speculative proposal had actually been suggested before by london @xcite .",
    "fock @xcite , klein @xcite , and others arrived at the principle of gauge invariance in the framework of wave mechanics along a completely different line .",
    "it was , however , weyl who emphasized the role of gauge invariance as a _ constructive principle _ from which electromagnetism can be derived .",
    "this point of view became very fruitful for our present understanding of fundamental interactions .",
    "we have described this more extensively in @xcite .",
    "these works underlie the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "on the 1@xmath0 of march 1918 weyl writes in a letter to einstein ( @xcite , vol .",
    "8b , doc.472 ) : `` these days i succeeded , as i believe , to derive electricity and gravitation from a common source  '' .",
    "einstein s prompt reaction by postcard indicates already a physical objection which he explained in detail shortly afterwards . before we come to this we have to describe weyl s theory of 1918 .",
    "weyl s starting point was purely mathematical .",
    "he felt a certain uneasiness about riemannian geometry , as is clearly expressed by the following sentences early in his paper :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ but in riemannian geometry described above there is contained a last element of geometry `` at a distance '' ( ferngeometrisches element )  with no good reason , as far as i can see ; it is due only to the accidental development of riemannian geometry from euclidean geometry .",

    "first , the spacetime manifold @xmath1 is equipped with a conformal structure , i.e. , with a class @xmath2 $ ] of conformally equivalent lorentz metrics @xmath3 ( and not a definite metric as in gr ) .",
    "this corresponds to the requirement that it should only be possible to compare lengths at one and the same world point .",
    "second , it is assumed , as in riemannian geometry , that there is an affine ( linear ) torsion - free connection which defines a covariant derivative @xmath4 , and respects the conformal structure .",
    "differentially this means that for any @xmath5 $ ] the covariant derivative @xmath6 should be proportional to @xmath3 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a differential 1-form .",
    "consider now a curve @xmath9\\rightarrow m$ ] and a parallel - transported vector field @xmath10 along @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath12 is the length of @xmath10 , measured with a representative @xmath5 $ ] , we obtain from ( [ 2.1 ] ) the following relation between @xmath13 for the initial point @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the end point @xmath16 : @xmath17 thus , the ratio of lengths in @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( measured with @xmath5 $ ] ) _ depends in general on the connecting path @xmath11 _ ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the length is only independent of @xmath11 if the curl of @xmath20 , @xmath21 vanishes .",
    "[ fig2 ]    the compatibility requirement ( [ 2.1 ] ) leads to the following expression for the christoffel symbols in weyl s geometry : @xmath22 the second @xmath20-dependent term is a characteristic new piece in weyl s geometry which has to be added to the christoffel symbols of riemannian geometry .    until now we have chosen a fixed , but arbitrary metric in the conformal class @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this corresponds to a choice of calibration ( or gauge ) . passing to another calibration with metric @xmath23 , related to @xmath3 by @xmath24 the potential @xmath20 in ( [ 2.1 ] ) will also change to @xmath25 , say . since the covariant derivative has an absolute meaning , @xmath25 can easily be worked out : on the one hand we have by definition @xmath26 and on the other hand we find for the left side with ( [ 2.1 ] ) @xmath27 thus @xmath28 this shows that a change of calibration of the metric induces a _",
    "`` gauge transformation '' _ for @xmath20 : @xmath29 only gauge classes have an absolute meaning .",
    "( the weyl connection is , however , gauge - invariant .",
    "this is conceptually clear , but can also be verified by direct calculation from expression  eq.([2.4 ] ) . )",
    "turning to physics , weyl assumes that his `` purely infinitesimal geometry '' describes the structure of spacetime and consequently he requires that physical laws should satisfy a double - invariance : 1",
    ". they must be invariant with respect to arbitrary smooth coordinate transformations .",
    "2 . they must be _ gauge invariant _",
    ", i.e. , invariant with respect to substitutions ( [ 2.7 ] ) for an arbitrary smooth function @xmath30 .",
    "nothing is more natural to weyl , than identifying @xmath31 with the vector potential and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.3 ] ) with the field strength of electromagnetism . in the absence of electromagnetic fields ( @xmath33 ) the scale factor @xmath34 in ( [ 2.2 ] ) for length transport becomes path independent ( integrable ) and one can find a gauge such that @xmath31 vanishes for simply connected spacetime regions",
    ". in this special case one is in the same situation as in gr .",
    "weyl proceeds to find an action which is generally invariant as well as gauge invariant and which would give the coupled field equations for @xmath3 and @xmath20 .",
    "we do not want to enter into this , except for the following remark . in his first paper @xcite weyl",
    "proposes what we call nowadays the yang - mills action @xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes the curvature form and @xmath37 its hodge dual ) is in local coordinates indeed just the expression @xmath38 which is used by weyl ( @xmath39= the curvature tensor of the weyl connection ) . ] .",
    "note that the latter is gauge invariant , i.e. , independent of the choice of @xmath5 $ ] . in weyl",
    "s geometry the curvature form splits as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the metric piece @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the action also splits , @xmath42 the second term is just the maxwell action .",
    "weyl s theory thus contains formally all aspects of a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "weyl emphasizes , of course , that the einstein - hilbert action is not gauge invariant .",
    "later work by pauli @xcite and by weyl himself @xcite led soon to the conclusion that the action ( [ 2.8 ] ) could not be the correct one , and other possibilities were investigated ( see the later editions of weyl s classic treatise @xcite ) .",
    "independent of the precise form of the action weyl shows that in his theory gauge invariance implies the _ conservation of electric charge _ in much the same way as general coordinate invariance leads to the conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "this beautiful connection pleased him particularly : ``  [ it ] seems to me to be the strongest general argument in favour of the present theory  insofar as it is permissible to talk of justification in the context of pure speculation . ''",
    "the invariance principles imply five ` bianchi type ' identities .",
    "correspondingly , the five conservation laws follow in two independent ways from the coupled field equations and may be `` termed the eliminants '' of the latter .",
    "these structural connections hold also in modern gauge theories .      after this sketch of weyl",
    "s theory we come to einstein s striking counterargument which he first communicated to weyl by postcard ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the problem is that if the idea of a nonintegrable length connection ( scale factor ) is correct , then the behavior of clocks would depend on their history .",
    "consider two identical atomic clocks in adjacent world points and bring them along different world trajectories which meet again in adjacent world points . according to ( [ 2.2 ] )",
    "their frequencies would then generally differ .",
    "this is in clear contradiction with empirical evidence , in particular with the existence of stable atomic spectra .",
    "einstein therefore concludes ( see @xcite , vol .",
    "507 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  ( if ) one drops the connection of the @xmath43 to the measurement of distance and time , then relativity looses all its empirical basis . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    [ fig3 ]    nernst shared einstein s objection and demanded on behalf of the berlin academy that it should be printed in a short amendment to weyl s article .",
    "weyl had to accept this .",

    "this corresponds to an identity in the coupled system of field equations which has to exist as a result of gauge invariance .",
    "all this is nowadays familiar to students of physics and does not need to be explained in more detail .",
    "much of weyl s paper penetrated also into his classic book `` the theory of groups and quantum mechanics '' @xcite . there",
    "he mentions also the transformation of his early gauge - theoretic ideas : `` this principle of gauge invariance is quite analogous to that previously set up by the author , on speculative grounds , in order to arrive at a unified theory of gravitation and electricity .",
