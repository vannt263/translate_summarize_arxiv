    "one of the major goals of the coming decades is to directly image a terrestrial exoplanet .",
    "direct imaging allows spectral information about the planet s atmosphere to be extracted from the spectrum of reflected light , including the potential presence of biomarkers , gases whose presence and abundance may indicate the presence of life . detecting planets directly is a difficult task , however , for two reasons : intensity ratio ( _ contrast _ ) and angular resolution . an earth - twin which orbits a sun - twin at 1au emits @xmath0 times less flux than the parent star in the visible band ;",
    "if the system was located at 10 parsecs from earth , the angular separation of the two objects would be 100mas , which for most proposed space telescopes puts the separation under @xmath1 .",
    "specialized methods are required to remove this flux at these small working angles .",
    "one proposed method of suppressing the starlight is an _ occulter _ , a spacecraft with a shaped edge flown in front of the telescope to block the starlight before it arrives at the telescope .",
    "the occulter size ( tens of meters ) and distance ( tens of thousands of kilometers ) are chosen so the angular extent of the occulter is smaller than some desired angle , on the order of 100 milliarcseconds , so exoplanets in orbit about the star will still be visible .",
    "the edge is shaped to control diffraction , with the form chosen to suppress the light to a factor of @xmath0 across the telescope aperture and over a wide spectral passband .",
    "a major advantage of this approach , compared to an internal coronagraph , is that it significantly loosens the tolerances on the optical quality and thermal stability of the telescope optics , as well as eliminating the need for a wavefront control system for active correction .",
    "conversely , the occulter itself must be built , deployed , and flown in formation to its own set of tolerances , and demonstrating this capability is an area of active research @xcite .",
    "these tolerances include limits on permanent errors in the occulter shape due to manufacturing and deployment errors ; transient shape deformations from thermal fluctuations and vibration ; and position and orientation changes of the occulter relative to the telescope - target axis from formation flying @xcite .    the scale of an occulter  and the distance it must maintain with respect to its target  precludes optical testing on the ground .",
    "all of these effects must be modeled in order to build an error budget and verify that an occulter can satisfy these requirements .",
    "the capture of the large dynamic range in the resulting field@xmath2 or greater in amplitude  drives the accuracy of the propagator used for the models , while the modeling of time - varying thermal shape deformations and closed - loop formation flying in broadband light drive the speed of the calculation",
    ". some of the most in - depth simulated observations can take from hours to days to run , and the ability to quickly and accurately model propagation past an occulter is thus a major enabling factor in the characterization of occulter system performance .",
    "section [ sec : current ] gives an overview of the current techniques ; the new technique presented in this work is described in sections [ sec : bdw ] and [ sec : vecpot ] , and a suggested implementation scheme , along with a pseudocode overview of the algorithm and some computational results , are given in section [ sec : imp ] .",
    "occulter designs take the general form of a solid central disk surrounded by @xmath3 identical tapering structures ( _ petals _ ) around the edge , giving the whole structure the general appearance of a flower .",
    "( an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binocc ] . )",
    "this shape is a result of their provenance as ( 0,1)-valued approximations to apodizers ; the general method to design an occulter is to determine a smooth apodization profile @xmath4 which can provide the necessary starlight suppression , and then convert it into a binary shape with a sufficient number of petals so that performance is not undermined .",
    "the actual form of @xmath4 can be determined by optimization @xcite or selecting an existing functional form @xcite .        for an occulter designed in this manner ,",

    "if a plane wave with amplitude @xmath17 and wavelength @xmath18 is normally - incident on the occulter , as would be the case for an occulter properly aligned with a target star , the electric field at a distance @xmath19 past the occulter would be written with the fresnel approximation and babinet s principle as @xmath20\\right\\ } }",

    "errors in ( for example ) occulter shape will modify @xmath5 , but eq . ( [ 2deq ] )",
    "will hold regardless .",
    "computing the integral for points in the plane of a telescope aperture is the key step in modeling the performance of an occulter .",
    "one could attempt this integral by brute force : discretizing the shape of the occulter over a sufficiently fine grid to capture all of the necessary structure , and propagating this to the telescope aperture with direct integration or a matrix fourier transform@xcite .",
    "this approach is not an easy task , as the occulter will be tens of meters across , with tolerances at the level of tens of microns@xcite , requiring a grid up to @xmath24 or more to capture the full shape of the profile , not including array padding .",
    "a better approach is to take advantage of the structure of the occulter : in the absence of errors , it has an @xmath3-fold symmetry in the azimuthal direction , and most errors introduce small perturbations to that .",
    "taking advantage of the symmetry leads to three main approaches to modeling propagation past an external occulter :    1 .",
    "integrals in @xmath25 : the bessel function expansion @xcite does the integral over @xmath26 explicitly , reducing the 2d integral to a series of single integrals in @xmath25 whose contributions fall off exponentially fast near the optical axis , which makes computation extremely quick in this region .",
    "the series can be modified to incorporate some shape errors @xcite at the expense of slower convergence .",
    "unfortunately , it is slower at locations far from the optical axis , and requires a good deal of effort to incorporate many types of errors , such as occulter tilt , into the model . aside from the propagation modeling , the first , radially - independent term in this series",
    "is used in optimization approaches @xcite to design occulter shapes .",
    "2 .   integrals in @xmath26 : the dubra - ferrari integral @xcite starts one step back from the fresnel form of eq .",
    "( [ 2deq ] ) , at the raleigh - sommerfeld diffraction integral , and evaluates the integral over @xmath25 to produce a pair of single integrals in angular coordinates , one of which holds for points inside the geometric extent of the starshade , and one which holds outside .",
    "this approach can incorporate most errors straightforwardly and spends the same amount of time to determine the field any point in the telescope aperture plane . because of the manner in which the integrals are segmented , however , the integrands are more difficult to determine correctly for points physically outside the extent of the starshade .",
    "perturbations to a nominal shape : the slit approach @xcite assumes the electric field for an occulter with no errors has been calculated by one of the above methods , and approximates the difference between the shape with and without errors as a series of long , thin boxes whose fresnel transforms can be calculated quickly and exactly .",
    "this method is very fast but necessarily approximate .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a fourth method  the boundary - diffraction - wave approach  which seems to out - perform the three extant methods for general purpose use .",
    "it maintains the constant - time property of the dubra - ferrari integral with a 2 - 3@xmath27 improvement in computational speed ; see sec .",
    "[ subsec : comp ] for further discussion .",
    "it incorporates all errors on the shape of the occulter natively , and can be written straightforwardly to include position and orientation errors , as well as model waves from off - axis sources , such as an exoplanetary system or the finite diameter of the star .",
    "it can also take advantage of the structure of the integral to evaluate the field at multiple wavelengths with little additional computation .",
    "the approach of defining the occulter solely in terms of its boundary is a good fit for tolerancing the sorts of errors that are expected for an occulter .",
    "manufacturing errors can be applied by specifically deforming desired edge regions ; errors in petal placement can be included by translating and rotating only the boundary points associated with that petal .",
    "most diffraction approaches to propagation through a finite aperture find their basis in the huygens - fresnel principle , which expresses the electric field at a point following the aperture as the sum over spherical waves emitting from every point within the aperture .",
    "however , a different representation was introduced by maggi and rubinowicz which splits the field into two parts , a part which propagates according to geometrical optics and a part which incorporates the effect of diffraction from the boundary . this boundary - diffraction - wave ( bdw ) representation",
    "was codified by the work of miyamoto and wolf @xcite , who showed that the boundary integral could be represented for any incident field entirely by a line integral around a vector potential .",
    "we will review their analysis briefly here .",
    "miyamoto and wolf @xcite begin by writing the kirchhoff formulation ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) for the diffraction integral from the aperture .",
    "consider a volume of space , bounded by a surface @xmath28 ; the field at any point @xmath29 within the volume may be expressed as an integral over all surface points @xmath30 on @xmath28 : @xmath31 here we let @xmath32 be the distance between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath33 be a vector normal to @xmath28 at point @xmath30 , and @xmath34 is the gradient evaluated at point @xmath30 . in the case of the occulter , the volume is the space @xmath35 , and @xmath28 stretches over the @xmath36 plane , as well as having a component at infinity which is assumed to vanish .",
    "( showing that this term vanishes requires some minor additional assumptions ; see sec .",
    "8.3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "it can then be shown @xcite that for @xmath37 of this form , there exists a vector potential @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 , and for plane waves incident on an aperture , that associated vector potential is @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the vector from the origin to @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is a point within the aperture on @xmath28 , and @xmath42 is the vector from the origin to @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath43 is the wavenumber and @xmath18 is the wavelength under consideration .",
    "the various @xmath32-variables become @xmath44 and we assume the form of the plane wave in the vector direction @xmath45 to be @xmath46 with amplitude @xmath17 . a coordinate diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coo ] .        next , we consider for the moment the case of an opaque screen with an opening over the region @xmath5 , a subregion of @xmath28 with boundary @xmath10 .",
    "we recall here that @xmath28 is the entire bounding surface of the half - plane @xmath35 , including the @xmath47 plane ; @xmath5 is the section of it on which the occulter lies .",

    "in general , @xmath38 will have singularities somewhere on @xmath28 for a given @xmath29 , as otherwise the field in the half - space past the aperture will be zero . in the specific case of the plane wave ,",
    "the lone singularity occurs at @xmath49 , which occurs only when @xmath50 is parallel to the propagation direction of the plane wave ; thus , the singularity will fall in the aperture _ only _ for points @xmath29 which fall in the beam as dictated by geometric optics .",
