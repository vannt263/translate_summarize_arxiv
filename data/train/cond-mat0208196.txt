    "furthermore , there is only a small number of capable approximate algorithms available for the study of @xmath2 properties of spin glasses @xcite , mostly restricted to @xmath16-dimensional lattice models , and eo provides a distinct alternative which will increase the confidence in the numerical results available . in previous papers",

    "it is non - zero only for small values and may be vanishing already beyond some finite , odd connectivity .    in the following",
    "we first introduce the bethe lattices we used in the numerical calculations . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "disordered spin systems on random graphs have been investigated as mean - field models for low - dimensional spin glasses or optimization problems , since variables are long - range connected yet have a small number of neighbors .",
    "particularly simple are bethe lattices of connectivity @xmath6 @xcite , also called fixed - valence or @xmath11-regular random graphs  @xcite .",
    "these are graphs consisting of @xmath13 vertices where each vertex possesses a fixed number @xmath6 of bonds with randomly selected other vertices . in comparison to the otherwise more familiar random graphs studied by erds and reny @xcite , bethe lattices at a given @xmath13 and @xmath21 avoid fluctuations in the connectivities of vertices and in the total number of bonds .",
    "there are slight variations in the generation of bethe lattices .",
    "for instance , to add a bond one could choose at random two vertices of connectivities @xmath22 to link until all vertices are @xmath6-connected .",
    "instead , we have used the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate these graphs . here ,",
    "all the terminals on the vertices form a list of @xmath23 independent variables . for each added bond",
    "two available terminals are chosen at random to be linked and removed from the list .",
    "furthermore , for algorithmic convenience , we reject graphs with possess self loops , bonds that connect two terminals of the same vertex .",
    "multiple bonds between any pair of vertices are allowed , otherwise it is too hard to generate feasible graphs for , say , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath6 remains finite for @xmath26 , the energy and entropy per spin would only be effected to @xmath27 by the differences between these choices .",
    "once a graphical instance is generated , we assign randomly chosen but fixed couplings @xmath28 to existing bonds between neighboring vertices @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "each vertex @xmath29 is occupied by a spin variable @xmath31 .",
    "the energy of the system is defined as the difference in number between violated bonds and satisfied bonds , @xmath32 and in this paper we will focus on the energy per spin , @xmath33 as a function of @xmath6 in the limit of @xmath26 . each instance can have a large degeneracy @xmath34 in the configurations exhibiting its ground state energy , and we also sample the average entropy , @xmath35 for these instances .",
    "the extremal optimization algorithm , @xmath36-eo , which we employ in this paper , has been discussed previously in @xcite , and in @xcite with regard to the setting of its one free parameter , @xmath36 . here",
    ", we merely describe the implementation of @xmath36-eo without further justification .    to obtain the numerical results in secs .",
    "[ tests]-[numerics ] , we used the following implementation of @xmath36-eo : for a given spin configuration on a graph , assign to each spin @xmath37 a `` fitness '' @xmath38 so that @xmath39 is satisfied .",
    "each spin falls into one of only @xmath40 possible states .",
    "say , currently there are @xmath41 spins with the worst fitness , @xmath42 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and so on up to @xmath45 spins with the best fitness @xmath46 .",
    "now draw a `` rank '' @xmath47 according to the distribution @xmath48 then , determine @xmath49 such that @xmath50 . finally , select any one of the @xmath51 spins in state @xmath30 and reverse its orientation _ unconditionally . _ as a result , it and its neighboring spins change their fitness .",
    "after all the effected @xmath52 s and @xmath13 s are reevaluated , a new spin is chosen for an update .",
    "this eo implementation updates spins with a ( @xmath36-dependent ) bias against poorly adapted spins on behalf of eq .",
    "( [ taueq ] ) .",
    "this process is `` extremal '' in the sense that it focuses on atypical variables , and it forms the basis of the eo method .",
    "the only adjustable parameter in this algorithm is the power - law exponent @xmath36 . for @xmath53 , randomly selected spins get forced to update , resulting in a random walk through the configuration space which would yield poor results . for @xmath54 , only spins in the worst state get updated which quickly traps the update process to a small region of the configuration space which may be far from a near - optimal solution .",
    "the arguments given in @xcite and a few experiments indicate that @xmath55 is a good choice to find ground states efficiently on bethe lattices .",
    "the algorithm never converges or `` freezes '' into a particular state but perpetually explores new near - optimal configurations .",
    "it is , of course , easy to simply store the lowest energy state found so far in a given run of @xmath36-eo and terminate when desired .",
    "previous experience with optimizing spin glasses with eo @xcite , and a few experiments , suggest a typical number of updates of @xmath56 for an eo - run to obtain saturation in the values found for ground states , at least up to the system sizes @xmath57 obtainable here . instead of pushing to attain larger values of @xmath13 , we opt here for obtaining better statistics by sampling more instances at smaller values of @xmath13 while spending even more time on each instance than may seem to be required , in an attempt to ensure accuracy . in particular , our implementation restarts for each instance at least @xmath58 times with new random initial spin - assignments , executing @xmath59 updates per run .",
    "if a new , lower - than - previous energy state is encountered in run @xmath11 , we adjust @xmath60 for that instance so that eo runs at least twice as many restarts as were necessary to find the lowest state in the first place . especially for small @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath61 hardly ever exceeds 4 ; for larger @xmath13 a few graphs require up to 25 restarts before termination .",
    "since eo perpetually explores new configurations it is well suited to explore also the degeneracy of low - energy states . in this case",
    "we not only store the first configuration found with the lowest energy for that instance .",
    "instead , we consider each configuration with the lowest energy , retaining new ones and rejecting all others .",
    "this procedure is somewhat inefficient and at best allows system sizes up to @xmath62 beyond which the degeneracy exceeds memory constraints .",
    "but it provides a fast way to also determine the @xmath2 entropy of the ground states with moderate accuracy . in these runs",
    ", we used a similar approach to the above , except for setting @xmath63 where @xmath11 is the latest run in which another new configuration of the lowest energy was located . here , for some highly degenerate instances at larger @xmath13 , @xmath61 could reach up into the @xmath64 s , further limiting attainable system sizes .",
    "to evaluate the proposed @xmath36-eo algorithm , we have run a series of test .",
    "first , we can defer to some already published results @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have calculate approximations to the ground state energy for @xmath0 spin glasses on a hypercubic lattice for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for systems up to @xmath67 which for each @xmath13 reproduced previous results obtained with sophisticated genetic algorithms @xcite ( although there we used a fixed @xmath61 ) . to evaluate the ability of the algorithm to determine the degeneracy of low - energy states found , we have reproduced within statistical error the results of ref .",

    "@xcite used a more efficient way to estimate the entropy from sampling only a small number of states . ) and it took eo only a fraction of a second to find all 60 ground states of a @xmath69 instance that had been exactly enumerated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to gauge @xmath36-eo s performance for larger @xmath13",
    ", we have run our implementation also on two @xmath17 lattice instances , @xmath703 - 8 - 50 and @xmath703 - 15 - 50 , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , considered in the 7th dimacs challenge for semi - definite problems @xcite .",
    "bounds @xcite on the ground - state cost established for the larger instance are @xmath73 ( from semi - definite programming ) and @xmath74 ( from branch - and - cut ) .",
    "eo found @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) , a significant improvement on the upper bound and already lower than @xmath77 found in refs .",
    "furthermore , we collected @xmath78 such states , which roughly segregate into 3 clusters with a mutual hamming distance of at least 100 distinct spins ; at best a small sample of the @xmath79 ground states expected @xcite ! for the smaller instance the bounds given are -922 and -912 , resp . , while eo finds -916 ( or @xmath80 ) and was terminated after finding @xmath78 such states . while this run ( including sampling degenerate states ) took only a few minutes of cpu ( at 800mhz ) , the results for the larger instance required about 16 hours .",

    "this difference for the entropies can be explained in terms of the `` free spins : '' in a highly frustrated system , even near ground states , many spins are stuck in a situation in which they violate many of their constraints , no matter how they are oriented , and changing from one direction to the other may hardly change the energy of the system . in particular , an even - connected spin that happens to violate exactly half of its bonds ( with @xmath87 ) can flip freely without any change to the energy .",
    "odd - connected spins can only become `` free '' in a connected pair ( that happens to violate exactly half of its _ external _ bonds but satisfies their mutual bond ) in which both simultaneously flip without changing the energy .",
    "the latter situation is naturally far less likely , and thus , purely even - connected graphs exhibit far more potential for degeneracy at the ground state than the corresponding odd - connected graphs . some preliminary studies for @xmath19 and 4 show that in ground state configurations the fraction of free spins ( zero by design for @xmath19 ) converges to a value just around 5% for @xmath88 , while the fraction of free pairs seems to vanish for large @xmath13 for both , even and odd @xmath6 . we have not explored the clustering of these states @xcite .",
