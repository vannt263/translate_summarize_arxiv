    "multiple scattering ( ms ) theory provides an accurate and flexible scheme for the calculation of unoccupied electronic states which are probed by various synchrotron experiments such as x - ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant elastic and in - elastic x - ray scattering .",
    "the standard theory relies on the single - particle picture , that is , it neglects electron correlation effects .",
    "this is a great shortcoming , since core - level x - ray spectra are often strongly modified by electron correlation , in particular by the coulomb and exchange interaction of the valence electrons with the core hole . in transition metal and rare earth systems , this interaction can give rise to pronounced atomic multiplet and satellite structures in the spectra , which can only be accounted for through many - electron calculations . a generalization of ms theory to many - electron wave functions was developed by natoli _",
    "et al . _",
    "[ 1 ] and is known as `` multi - channel '' ms theory .",
    "probably the most difficult part of this approach is the calculation of the inter - channel potential . here",
    ", we propose a reformulation of the theory , where the latter problem is completely avoided . instead , the multi - channel t - matrix is calculated variationally using the eigen - channel r - matrix method  @xcite .",
    "while r - matrix methods are well known in atomic spectroscopy , they have , to our knowledge , never been used for condensed matter problems .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a calculation of electron energy loss from nio using an r - matrix method .",
    "they used , however , an atomic model where all solid state effects were described phenomenologically using an crystal field and a reduced coulomb interaction .    here",
    ", we present a new formalism for x - ray absorption in condensed matter , based on multi - channel ms theory and the eigen - channel r - matrix method . it allows to take account for local electron correlation effects in a multi - channel , that is , configuration interaction scheme . at present , the type of correlations that can be handled on this level are limited to those between one electron in a delocalized state and a finite number of electrons / holes in ( sufficiently ) localized orbitals .",
    "sufficiently localized means that the wave function is negligible small beyond the atomic radius .",
    "this applies exactly to inner - core shells and well to the @xmath2-shell in rare earths .",
    "extensions of the method to include correlation effects between several delocalized electrons are under way .    in this paper , we present the formalism and report results on the ca - l@xmath3-edge absorption of different ca compounds .",
    "the ca - l@xmath3-edge is an interesting test case for the new method , because the @xmath4 and @xmath5 absorption channels are strongly coupled through the photo - electron  core - hole coulomb interaction .",
    "this leads to a branching ratio of about 1:1 , far from the statistical ratio ( 2:1 ) which is obtained in single - particle theory . from a point of view of atomic multiplet theory  @xcite , the non - statistical branching ratio is easily understood as a case of strong intermediate coupling in the ( @xmath6 ) final state .",
    "the multipole and exchange part of the 2@xmath7 - 3@xmath8 coulomb interaction ( slater - integrals @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 ) is of comparable strength as the 2@xmath7-spin - orbit interaction , which gives rise to correlated @xmath6 final state wave functions , where the @xmath12 and @xmath13-holes are strongly mixed .",
    "the fact that the branching ratio does not change when going from atomic ca  @xcite to various ca compounds  @xcite is empirical evidence that this atomic multiplet picture remains valid in condensed matter .",
    "however , a purely atomic model is not sufficient to account for fine structure in the @xmath0-edge spectra , which depends strongly on the atomic environment  @xcite ( and which is thereby of practical importance for structural and electronic analysis . )",
    "atomic models including crystal field have proved quite successful in reproducing the experimental spectra at the @xmath0-edge  @xcite . in that approach , all extra - atomic effects are , however , treated in an empirical way , by introducing adjustable parameters for crystal field and ( possibly ) band broadening .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite was the first to go beyond the atomic model by considering a model hamiltonian that included not only the atomic @xmath14-@xmath15 multiplet coupling but also the single electron density of states of bulk  ca .",
    "the electron ",
    "hole problem was solved exactly using a green s function technique . while being physically sound , zaanen s method was not fully based on first principle calculations , but introduced a number of empirical parameters .",
    "later on , schwitalla and ebert  @xcite calculated the spectra in the time - dependent local - density - approximation ( td - lda ) . for bulk",
    "ca , they obtained the correct branching ratio , but the fine structure of their spectrum was quite different from the experimental one .",
    "recently , ankudinov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the branching ratio problem with a generalization of td - lda . by adding a frequency and matrix - element dependent exchange - correlation contribution to the td - lda kernel",
    ", they obtained a branching ratio in good agreement with experiment for ca and the whole transition metal series , while in ref .",
    "@xcite this was true only for the lighter elements ( from ca to  v ) . from the theoretical studies cited above",
    ", it may seem that the branching ratio problem at the @xmath0-edge of ca has been thoroughly investigated . despite of this",
    ", we have chosen the ca system as a test case for our new method , which , we believe , provides new insight into other aspects of the problem , like the orbital relaxation around the core - hole and the reason for the need of a 20% reduction of the slater integrals @xmath9 and @xmath10 in atomic multiplet calculations  @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the present method comes in at two levels : it is the first application of the multi - channel ms formalism and it is ( to our knowledge ) the first true application of @xmath16-matrix techniques to a condensed matter problem . the combination of these two features will allow us to shed some light on the two points mentioned above ( orbital relaxation and reduction factors ) and to present an application to the ca compounds cao and caf@xmath1 , in which ligand field effects and multiplet structure are treated in a unique framework in an _ ab initio _ way .",

    "in the present approach we go beyond the independent particle model by considering a correlated wave function for a finite number of @xmath18 electrons .",
    "all other electrons are described within the independent particle approximation . among the @xmath18",
    "explicitly treated electrons , at most one is in a delocalized orbital , all others necessarily occupy localized orbitals . by definition ,",
    "a localized orbital is one that is negligibly small outside the atomic sphere .",
    "this applies exactly to inner shell orbitals but also to a good approximation to 4@xmath19-orbitals of the rare - earths . in the ground state wave function ,",
    "the @xmath18  electrons include the core electron that is excited in the xas process plus @xmath20 other electrons in localized orbitals .",
    "the xas final state wave function then contains @xmath20 localized electrons and one electron ( the `` photo - electron '' ) in a delocalized state above the fermi level .",
    "in other words , we consider a correlated final state wave function that couples the photo - electron with the core - hole and and/or a finite number of other localized electrons . in order to make the derivation less abstract",

    "the r - matrix and the inner solutions  @xmath48 are calculated through the eigen - channel method and then the atomic multi - channel t - matrix  @xmath196 and the dipole transition matrix elements are readily obtained from eqs  ( [ eq_tm1 ] ) and ( [ eq_redip ] ) .",

    "[ eq_tau00 ] ) and obtain the xas cross section from eq .",
    "( [ eq_sigma ] ) .    by virtue of the separation between environment and absorber through the partitioning technique ,",
    "the present implementation of the multi - channel ms method is numerically only little heavier than the standard ( single - channel ) ms method . indeed , in the present application , the atomic multi - channel calculation ( second step above ) was an order of magnitude faster than the reflectivity calculation by the standard ms technique .",

    "the spectra labeled ( g ) have been obtained with the ground state potential ( i.e.  @xmath199 ) .",
    "the spectra in full ( dashed ) lines have been calculated with ( without ) the multipole part of the electron  hole interaction  @xmath200 . for easy comparison of the line shapes ,",
    "all spectra are aligned at threshold and normalized with respect to the height of their main peak .",
    "note that before normalization , the intensity of the spectra without  @xmath200 ( dashed lines ) was considerably bigger than the corresponding spectra with  @xmath200 ( full lines ) .",
    "the relative renormalization factors between the two types of spectra , that have been used in fig .  [ fig_caspec ] , are : 1.8 ( g ) , 2.3 ( 0 ) , 3.3 ( 0.1 ) , and 3.8 ( 0.15 ) .    probably the most striking feature of the spectra in fig .  [ fig_caspec ] is the effect of the multipole part of the electron  hole interaction  @xmath200 : in all cases , it leads to a big transfer of spectral weight from the @xmath5 edge ( lower energy peak ) to the @xmath4-edge .",
    "the branching ratio thus changes from @xmath201 without  @xmath200 to somewhat less than @xmath202 , which is in good agreement with experiment .",
    "this spectral weight transfer comes from the mixing between the @xmath12 and the @xmath13-hole states ( which correspond , in the one - electron approximation , to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 edges , respectively ) .",
    "it is a genuine atomic multiplet effect which was first explained by zaanen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . as can be seen from a `` vertical '' comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig_caspec ] , the choice of the core - hole potential  @xmath112 has only a minor effect on the branching ratio , but it changes the line shape of the two edges _ individually _ , as it can be expected from a single - particle quantity .",
    "going from ( g ) to ( 0 ) , or increasing the parameter  @xmath30 has the effect of shifting the peak positions of the two edges to lower energy and of reducing their width .",
    "it moreover leads an overall shift of the whole spectrum to lower energy .",
    "this shift , which is roughly 1  ev for ( g)@xmath203(0 ) , ( 0)@xmath203(0.1 ) , and ( 0.1)@xmath203(0.15 ) , is , however , not apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig_caspec ] , because we have aligned the spectra at threshold . when comparing the spectra including  @xmath200 with the experimental one , it is clear that ( g ) and ( 0 ) have much too broad peaks",
    ". moreover , their peak positions relative to threshold are at too high energy , especially for  ( g ) .",
    "good agreement for both peak width and positions is obtained for spectra ( 0.1 ) and ( 0.15 ) .",
    "the only disagreement is that these two theoretical spectra show a weak fine - structure which was not observed experimentally .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of further broadening mechanisms , other than coupling to the band , which is included here by the multiple scattering of the photo - electron .",
    "_ suggested that the broadening might be due to strong auto - ionization .",
    "the discrepancy could , however , also reveal limitations of the present screening model , which neglects charge fluctuations .",
    "let us note that our spectrum  ( g ) looks identical with the one obtained by schwitalla _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite within time - dependent local density approximation .",
    "this shows that their method does not take account of the monopole part of the electron ",
    "hole interaction .    for a contrast to the _ metallic _ bulk ca , we have applied the method also to two _ insulating _ ca compounds : cao and caf@xmath1 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig_caspec ] , the spectra have been normalized and aligned at threshold . for the latter , the spectra  ( g )",
    "have been shifted by 3.5  ev to lower energy relative to the others in both compounds .",
    "the meaning of labels and line - styles is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig_caspec ] .",
    "the spectra  ( g ) , which correspond to a total neglect of the core - hole and the multipole terms  @xmath200 , are again completely at odds with the experimental spectrum  ( e ) . when using a screened core - hole potential  @xmath112 with @xmath204 , but still neglecting the multipole terms  @xmath200 [ dashed  line  ( 0.1 ) ] , the spectra consist of four narrow lines ( the finite width comes entirely from the added lorentzian+gaussian broadening ) .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 peaks into two doublets is due to a strong ligand field effect . by symmetry resolved ms calculations",
    ", we have checked that for cao , the lower ( higher ) energy peaks correspond to @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) symmetry states in the @xmath207 point group . in caf@xmath1 the order between @xmath205 and @xmath206 peaks",
    "is reversed .",
    "these spectra are , however , still very different from the experimental ones . when finally also the multipole part of the interaction  @xmath200 is taken into account [ full  line  ( 0.1 ) ] , very good agreement with experiment is obtained for both compounds .",
    "it should be noted that himpsel _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who used an atomic crystal field model , could also get very good agreement with experiment .",
    "however , in that work the crystal field is introduced empirically and its parameter values are adjusted to experiment .",
    "in summary , we have presented a method for x - ray absorption in condensed matter where single - electron features are described in the ms approach , while local multi - electron effects are taken into account in a configuration interaction scheme .",
    "the novel features of the method are the multi - channel extension of ms theory and the use of an r - matrix technique in condensed matter .",
    "the method has been applied to the ca - l@xmath3 edge absorption of several ca systems .",
    "the electron ",
    "hole coulomb interaction was divided into its monopole and its ( higher order ) multipole part .",
    "the latter , which is responsible for the non - statistical l@xmath208:l@xmath209 branching ratio , was taken unscreened .",
    "we showed that no rescaling for this part is needed in our method in contrast to single configuration multiplet calculations .",
    "for the monopole term , a mixture between an unscreened and a statically screened core - hole potential was applied . a mixing factor of about 10% yields line shapes in good agreement with experiment in all cases .",
    "non - local correlation effects such as charge transfer excitations have been neglected in the present work .",
    "let us mention , however , that such effects can , in principle , be included when the r - matrix reaction volume is extended from a single atom to a small cluster of atoms around the absorber .",
    "compared to recent approaches based on time dependent density functional theory  @xcite , we believe that the present , configuration interaction based method provides more insight in the correlation mechanisms at play . moreover , the present approach can easily be applied to problems where the applicability of td - dft has yet to be proved , namely core - level spectroscopies that involve more than one hole ( such as auger processes ) or open 4@xmath19-shells .",
    "compared to atomic multiplet methods  @xcite , the present approach does not rely on adjustable crystal field parameters . instead ,",

    "nevertheless , we think it is worth including this section for the convenience of the reader , because the derivation is simpler than the one in ref .",
    "@xcite and it lends itself better to the form of the @xmath18-electron wave functions used in the present work .",
    "we start from the general multi - electron formula for the total optical absorption cross section in the dipole approximation  @xcite : @xmath210 here , @xmath211 and @xmath212 are @xmath18-electron wave functions , for initial ( = ground ) and final state , respectively , in the absorption process of a photon with energy  @xmath213 . in case of degenerate ground states ,",

    "we assume that @xmath20  electrons remain in localized orbitals and at most one electron ( the `` photo - electron '' ) is promoted to a continuum orbital .",

    "the rest system is in one of the eigenstates  @xmath225 of the @xmath20 electron hamiltonian with a core hole : @xmath226 .",
    "thus , the `` incoming part '' of @xmath222 is given by @xmath227 .",
    "in multi - channel scattering theory , not only elastic , but also inelastic scattering processes are taken into account , which correspond to excitations @xmath228 . in the present approach ,",

    "we can write @xmath231 here @xmath232 behaves asymptotically ( @xmath233 ) like a purely outgoing spherical wave . in the above form of @xmath222 , anti - symmetrization between the photo - electron and the @xmath20 other electrons has been disregarded .",
    "we indeed neglect anti - symmetrization for the `` outside solution '' , i.e.  when the photo - electron is outside the atomic sphere of the absorber . for the solution inside the atomic sphere",
    ", however , anti - symmetrization between all electrons is correctly taken into account through the eigen - channel method ( see main text ) .",
    "note that in this work we have , for simplicity , assumed the `` muffin - tin '' or more precisely atomic sphere approximation for the one - electron potential i.e.  the atomic cells are replaced by space filling spheres with spherically symmetric potential inside .",

    "the present multi - channel approach could easily be generalized to non - muffin - tin multiple scattering methods in which the muffin - tin spheres are replaced by space - filling atomic cells .",
