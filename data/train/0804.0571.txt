    "one of the most prominent manifestations of chaos in classical physics is the hypersensitivity of the dynamics to perturbations in the initial conditions or hamiltonian .",
    "that is , two trajectories of a chaotic system launched from two infinitesimally close phase - space points deviate exponentially from each other ; so do the trajectories starting from the same point in phase space , but evolving under slightly different hamiltonians . in a quantum system",
    "it is natural to consider @xmath0 as a measure of `` separation '' of two quantum states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the unitarity of quantum propagators renders the overlap of any two states of the same system unchanged in the course of time .",
    "thus , quantum systems are said to be stable with respect to perturbations of the initial state .",
    "however , a perturbation of the hamiltonian can ( and usually does ) result in a nontrivial time dependence of the wave function overlap , suggesting a viable approach for describing instabilities and , therefore , for quantifying chaos in quantum systems .",
    "peres @xcite proposed to consider the overlap @xmath3 of the state @xmath4 , resulting from an initial state @xmath5 after evolution for a time @xmath6 under the hamiltonian @xmath7 , with the state @xmath8 obtained from evolving the same initial state through @xmath6 , but under a slightly different ( perturbed ) hamiltonian @xmath9 .",
    "he showed that the long - time behavior of @xmath10 depends on whether the underlying classical dynamics is regular or chaotic .    in the field of quantum computing @xmath11",
    "is an important concept , usually referred to as _ fidelity _ @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 can be also interpreted as the squared overlap of the initial state @xmath5 and the state obtained by first propagating @xmath5 through time @xmath6 under the hamiltonian @xmath7 , and then through time @xmath12 under the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath9 ( or @xmath13 from @xmath6 to @xmath14 ) .",
    "this time - reversal interpretation constitutes a description of the echo experiments that have been performed by nuclear magnetic resonance since the fifties @xcite .",
    "when the hamiltonian @xmath7 describes some complex ( many - body or chaotic ) dynamics @xmath11 is referred to as _ loschmidt echo _ ( le ) @xcite , and this is the terminology we will adopt .    by construction ,",
    "the le equals unity at @xmath15 , and typically decays further in time .",
    "most of the analytical studies so far addressed the quantity @xmath16 corresponding to the le averaged either over an ensemble of initial states , or over an ensemble of different perturbed ( and/or unperturbed ) hamiltonians .",
    "@xmath16 has been predicted to follow different decay regimes in various chaotic systems with several hamiltonian perturbations @xcite .",
    "depending on the nature and strength of the perturbation , @xmath17 , one recognizes the _ perturbative _ gaussian @xcite , the non - diagonal or _",

    "the perturbative , fgr and lyapunov regimes , listed above in the order of the ( properly defined ) increasing perturbation strength , constitute the framework for classification of le decay regimes @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that the full variety of system- and perturbation - dependent decay regimes is rather rich , and extends far beyond the above list : double - lyapunov @xcite , super - exponential @xcite and power law @xcite decay regimes serve as examples .",
    "we further note that analytical results for the time decay of the _ unaveraged _ le , @xmath11 , are currently available only for very few chaotic systems @xcite .    the discovery @xcite of the lyapunov regime for the decay of the averaged le in classically chaotic systems , @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the average lyapunov exponent , provided a strong and appealing connection between classical and quantum chaos : it related a measure of instability of the quantum dynamics , such as the le , to a quantity characterizing the instability of the corresponding classical dynamics , i.e. the lyapunov exponent .",
    "this result awoke the interest on the le in the quantum chaos community .",
    "the lyapunov regime has been numerically observed in several two - dimensional chaotic systems , i.e. in the lorentz gas @xcite , the bunimovich stadium @xcite , the smooth stadium billiard @xcite , a josephson flux qubit device @xcite , as well as in one - dimensional time - dependent hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "the theory of the lyapunov decay of the le mainly relies on the following two assumptions : ( i ) the validity of the structural stability arguments ( supported by the shadowing theorem @xcite ) , and ( ii ) the global nature of the hamiltonian perturbation .",
    "the first assumption guarantees a unique one - to - one mapping of trajectories of the unperturbed system to those of the perturbed system .",
    "this mapping allows for efficient pairing of the trajectories of the unperturbed and perturbed system in the diagonal approximation @xcite .",
    "the second assumption implies that the hamiltonian perturbation affects every trajectory of the system , and , therefore , all trajectories are responsible for the decay of the le",
    ". however , this is by no means the most general situation when we consider possible experimental realizations of the le .    in the present work",
    "we extend the semiclassical theory of the le by lifting the second of the two above - mentioned assumptions , i.e. _ we allow for a local perturbation in coordinate space_. in this context the le decay was previously addressed in the case of a _ strong _ local perturbation @xcite , i.e. for a billiard exposed to a local boundary deformation much larger than the de broglie wavelength .",
    "analytical and numerical calculations yielded a novel le decay regime , for which @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the probability ( per unit time ) of the corresponding classical particle to encounter the boundary deformation .",
    "@xmath21 can also be viewed as a classical _ escape rate _ from a related open billiard obtained from the original ( closed ) one by removing the deformation - affected boundary segment . in this work",
    "we explore all possible strengths of a local perturbation and describe the transition from the weak to the strong perturbation regime that completes the previous picture .",
    "in particular we show that the rate of the exponential decay of the le oscillates as a function of the perturbation strength as the escape - rate regime is approached .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section_theory ] we develop a comprehensive semiclassical approach of the le decay due to local hamiltonian perturbations of increasing strength .",
    "we perform a systematic analysis of the different decay regimes and establish their relation to the previously known decay regimes in the case of a global perturbation . in section  [ section_numerics ]",

    "<S> we address the sensitivity of quantum mechanical time evolution by considering the time decay of the loschmidt echo ( le ) ( or fidelity ) for local perturbations of the hamiltonian . within a semiclassical approach </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytical expressions for the le decay for chaotic systems for the whole range from weak to strong local perturbations and identify different decay regimes which complement those known for the case of global perturbations . for weak perturbations a fermi - golden - rule ( fgr ) type behavior is recovered . for strong perturbations the escape - rate regime is reached , where the le decays exponentially with a rate independent of the perturbation strength . the transition between the fgr regime and the escape - rate regime is non - monotonic , i.e. the rate of the exponential time - decay of the le oscillates as a function of the perturbation strength . </S>",
    "<S> we further perform extensive quantum mechanical calculations of the le based on numerical wave packet evolution which strongly support our semiclassical theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss in some detail possible experimental realizations for observing the predicted behavior of the le . </S>"
