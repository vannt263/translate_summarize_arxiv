    "the response of a strongly interacting electronic system to impurities has long been a fruitful way of experimentally and theoretically elucidating the subtle correlations in its many - body ground state wavefunction .",
    "the most prominent example is the kondo effect , which describes the interplay between a variety of impurities with a spin and/or ` flavor ' degree of freedom and a system of free fermions with either a finite @xcite or vanishing @xcite density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "more recently , the impurity responses of a variety of ` non - fermi - liquid ' bulk states have been studied .",
    "@xcite the @xmath1 antiferromagnetic spin chain generically has a critical ground state , and displays interesting universal characteristics in its response to impurities or boundaries @xcite .",
    "universality was also found in the general theory @xcite of impurities in ` dimerized ' quantum antiferromagnets in spatial dimensions @xmath2 near a quantum critical point between a nel state and a confining spin gap state .",
    "such ` dimerized ' antiferromagnets have an even number of @xmath1 spins per unit cell , and consequently their bulk quantum criticality is described within the conventional landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) framework of a fluctuating nel order parameter.@xcite away from the impurity , such systems only have excitations which carry integer spin .    it is the purpose of this paper to extend the above theory @xcite to fractionalized ` spin liquid ' states in spatial dimensions @xmath2 with neutral @xmath1 excitations ( ` spinons ' ) in the bulk . such spinon excitations carry gauge charges associated with an ` emergent ' gauge force ( distinct from the electromagnetic forces ) , typically with the gauge group @xcite @xmath3 or u(1 ) , and we will argue shortly that such gauge forces play a key role in the response of spin liquid states to impurities .",
    "earlier analyses@xcite of the influence of impurities in the u(1 ) ` staggered - flux ' spin liquid ignored the crucial gauge forces ; we will comment in detail on the relationship of our results to these works in section  [ sec : kk ] .",
    "an analysis of impurities in a @xmath3 spin liquid state was presented recently by florens _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite",
    "but for a particular situation in which a spin moment was strongly localized on an impurity and gauge forces could be safely neglected ; we will comment further on their work in section  [ sec : z2 ] .",
    "there are a number of experimental motivations for our work .",
    "a large number of experiments have studied zn and ni impurities in the cuprates,@xcite and much useful information has been obtained on the spatial and temperature dependence of the induced moments around the impurity",
    ". it would clearly be useful to compare these results with the corresponding predictions for different spin liquid states , and for states proximate to quantum critical points .",
    "we will show here that there are significant differences in the experimental signatures of the different candidates , and this should eventually allow clear discrimination by a comparison to experimental results .",
    "a second motivation comes from a recent nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) study @xcite of the @xmath1 triangular lattice organic mott insulator @xmath4-(et)@xmath5cu@xmath5(cn)@xmath6 , which possibly has a non - magnetic , spin singlet ground state .",
    "the nmr signal shows significant inhomogeneous broadening , indicative of local fields nucleated around impurities . our theoretical predictions here for knight shift around impurities should also assist here in selecting among the candidate ground states .",
    "an important observations is that in situations with deconfinement in the bulk , the bulk spinons are readily available to screen any moments associated with an impurity atom ( as has also been noted by florens _",
    "_ @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "for a non - magnetic impurity ( such as zn on a cu site ) , there is no _ a priori _ reason for the impurity to acquire a strongly localized moment .",
    "consequently , it is very useful to consider the case where the impurity has local net spin @xmath7 .",
    "naively , such a situation might seem quite uninteresting , as there is then no local spin degree of freedom which can interact non - trivially with the excitations of the spin liquid .",
    "indeed , in a fermi liquid , a non - magnetic impurity has little effect , apart from a local renormalization of fermi liquid parameters , and there is no kondo physics .",
    "however , in spin liquids the impurity can carry an _ electric gauge charge _",
    "@xmath8 , and the primary purpose of this paper will be to demonstrate that a @xmath9 , @xmath7 impurity displays rich and universal physics .",
    "we will primarily consider u(1 ) spin liquids here : then an important dynamical degree of freedom is a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath10 , where @xmath11 extends over the @xmath12 spacetime directions , including the imaginary time direction , @xmath13 .",
    "our considerations here can also be easily extended to @xmath3 spin liquids , and this will be described later in section  [ sec : z2 ] .",
    "we normalize the @xmath10 gauge field such that the spinons have electric charges @xmath14 . in the popular u(1 )",
    "gauge theories of antiferromagnets on the square lattice ( which we will describe more specifically below ) , a vacancy will carry a gauge charge @xmath15 .",
    "thus , a zn impurity on the cu square lattice site has @xmath16 .",
    "this can be understood by thinking of the impurity as a localized ` holon ' in the doped antiferromagnet , which also carries such gauge charges @xcite .",
    "we will consider theories here with actions of the structure @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bulk action of the spin liquid in the absence of any impurity , and @xmath19 represents the perturbation due to an impurity which we assume is localized near the origin of spatial coordinates , @xmath20 .",
    "we will argue that the dominant term in @xmath19 is the coupling of the impurity to the u(1 ) gauge field : @xmath21 we will demonstrate that additional terms in the impurity action are unimportant or ` irrelevant ' . the @xmath19 above can be regarded as the remnant of the spin berry phase that characterized the impurity in the previous theory @xcite of dimerized antiferromagnets ; the latter berry phase for a spin @xmath22 impurity was @xmath23 times the area enclosed by the path mapped on the unit sphere by the time history of the impurity spin .",

    "( [ imp1 ] ) was presented in ref .  .",
    "we will consider a variety of realizations of the bulk spin liquid @xmath18 in this paper .",
    "our primary results will be for u(1 ) algebraic spin liquids , @xcite which are described by 2 + 1 dimensional conformal field theories ( cft ) and we specialize our presentation to these cft cases in the remainder of this section .",
    "an algebraic spin liquid has gapless spinon excitations which interact strongly with the @xmath10 gauge field .",
    "an explicit realization appears in the deconfined quantum critical point @xcite between nel and valence bond solid ( vbs ) states , in which the spinons are relativistic bosons described by the @xmath24 field theory .",
    "another is found in the ` staggered flux ' ( sf ) phase of su(@xmath25 ) antiferromagnets , where the spinons are dirac fermions @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the algebraic spin liquid is described by a 2 + 1 dimensional conformal field theory , and our primary purpose here is to describe the _ boundary conformal field theory _ that appears in the presence of @xmath19 .",
    "our central observation , forming the basis of our results , is that @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ imp1 ] ) is an _ exactly marginal _ perturbation to the bulk conformal field theory .",
    "this non - renormalization is a consequence of u(1 ) gauge invariance , which holds both in the bulk and on the impurity .",
    "we will verify this non - renormalization claim in a variety of perturbative analyses of the conformal field theory .",
    "the claim can also be viewed as a descendant of the non - renormalization of the spin berry phase term , found in ref .  .",
    "the exact marginality of @xmath19 has immediate consequences for the response of the system to a uniform applied magnetic field @xmath26 .",
    "the impurity susceptibility , @xmath27 , defined as the change in the total bulk susceptibility due to the presence of the impurity , obeys @xmath28 at finite temperature @xmath29 above a conformal ground state ; this can be extended by standard scaling forms ( as in ref .  )",
    "to proximate gapped or ordered phases , as we will describe in the body of the paper .",
    "we set @xmath30 and absorb a factor of the magneton , @xmath31 , in the definition of the zeeman field . with this , @xmath32 is a dimensionless universal number , dependent only upon the value of @xmath8 , and the universality class of the bulk conformal field theory .",
    "it is remarkable that the response of the impurity has a curie - like @xmath29 dependence , albeit with an anomalous curie constant @xmath32 ( which is likely an irrational number ) .",
    "this anomalous curie response appears even though there is no spin moment localized on the impurity . in contrast , the earlier results for the lgw quantum critical point presented in ref .   had an unscreened moment present and so a curie response did not appear as remarkable . here",
    ", it is due to the deformation of a continuum of bulk excitations by the impurity , and the @xmath0 power - law is a simple consequence of the fact that @xmath26 and @xmath29 both scale as an energy .",
    "indeed any other external field , coupling to a total conserved charge , will also have a corresponding universal @xmath0 susceptibility .    a curie - like response of an impurity in the staggered flux phase",
    "was also noted early on by khalliulin and collaborators , @xcite and others.@xcite however , in their mean - field analysis , they associated this response with a zero energy ` bound state ' , and hence argued that @xmath33 .",
    "as noted above , the actual interpretation is different : there is a critical continuum of excitations , and its collective boundary critical response has a curie temperature dependence as a consequence of hyperscaling properties .",
    "consequently , @xmath32 does not equal the curie constant of a single spin , and is a non - trivial number which is almost certainly irrational .",
    "we will discuss the earlier work more explicitly in section  [ sec : kk ] .",
    "we will also consider the spatial dependence of the response to a uniform applied field , @xmath26 , in the presence of an impurity , as that determines the knight shift in nmr experiments .",
    "the uniform magnetization density induced by the applied field leads to a knight shift @xmath34 ; at @xmath29 above a conformal ground state this obeys ( the scaling form is also as in ref .  ):",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the spinon velocity in the bulk ( we assume the bulk theory has dynamic critical exponent @xmath37 , and henceforth set @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 is a universal function , and the knight shift is normalized so that @xmath40 the function @xmath41 has a power - law singularity as @xmath42 , with the exponent determined by a ` boundary scaling dimension ' : this will be described in the body of the paper for the various cases .",
    "in addition to the locally uniform knight shift , an impurity in the presence of a uniform applied field also induces a ` staggered ' moment which typically oscillates at the wavevector associated with a proximate magnetically ordered state .",
    "this leads to a staggered knight shift , @xmath43 , which we will also consider here .",
    "such a staggered knight shift does appear for the deconfined critical theory describing the nel - vbs transition , and it has a spatial distribution associated with that of the nel state .",
    "however , the response for the u(1 ) sf spin liquid is dramatically different .",
    "one of our primary results is that for the scaling limit theory of the u(1 ) sf spin liquid , an applied magnetic field in the presence of an impurity induces _",
    "none _ of the many competing orders @xcite associated with the spin liquid .",
    "thus there is no analog of the ` staggered ' knight shift .",
    "a subdominant induction of competing orders can arise upon including irrelevant operators associated with corrections to scaling ; the primary response , however , is just the induction of a ferromagnetic moment , which has a slowly - varying , space - dependent envelope in the vicinity of the impurity specified by @xmath44 .    our conclusions above for the impurity response of the u(1 )",
    "sf spin liquid differ from the earlier mean - field theories.@xcite they found an induced moment which had a strong oscillation between the two sublattices of the square lattice .",
    "we demonstrate here that this oscillation disappears in the continuum field theory which accounts for the gauge fluctuations .",
    "we are not aware of any reason why fluctuation corrections to the mean - field predictions should be considered small .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : cpn ]",
    ", we will consider the @xmath24 model field theory which describes the vicinity of the nel - vbs transition .",
    "the u(1 ) sf spin liquid will then be described in section  [ sec : sf ] .",
    "other spin liquids , not described by cfts or by exactly marginal impurity perturbations , will be briefly discussed in section  [ sec : other ] .",
    "finally , experimental implications and a summary appear in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the @xmath24 model describes the deconfined quantum critical point between the nel and vbs states on the square lattice.@xcite it is a field theory of complex scalars @xmath45 , @xmath46 , with global su(@xmath25 ) symmetry and a coupling to the u(1 ) gauge field @xmath10 .",
    "near the transition at which global su(@xmath25 ) symmetry is broken we can work with the effective action @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a spacetime coordinate , @xmath11 extends over @xmath49 spacetime indices , @xmath49 is the dimension of spacetime , related to the spatial dimensionality , @xmath50 , by @xmath51 we are interested in the phases of the field theory in eq .",
    "( [ cpn - action ] ) as a function of the tuning parameter @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 there is a magnetically ordered phase with global su(@xmath25 ) symmetry broken , while for @xmath54 we have a spin - gap phase with full su(@xmath25 ) symmetry .",
    "we are especially interested in the conformally - invariant critical point which separates these phases .",
    "we will begin by reviewing the critical properties of the bulk action @xmath18 alone in the following subsection , and describe impurity effects in the subsequent subsections .",
    "we will restrict our analysis here to the @xmath55 expansion where @xmath56 this was carried out by halperin _",

    "_ , a stable fixed point is obtained in the @xmath55 expansion only for sufficiently large values of @xmath25 .",
    "however , it is expected that in the physical dimension of @xmath57 , the fixed point may well be stable down to the needed values of @xmath25 .",
    "our purpose here is to understand the basic features of the second - order critical point , and its response to impurities : so we will assume that the value of @xmath25 is large enough to ensure stability of the fixed point .",
    "this will delineate the essential scaling structure of the impurity response , but is not expected to be quantitatively accurate .",
    "it is also possible to analyze this model using the @xmath58 expansion , directly in @xmath59 .",

    "the result is an effective action for bosonic spinons @xmath45 which describes a bulk transition from a ordered state with non - collinear magnetic order to a @xmath3 spin liquid .",
    "this is proposed as a possible model for the triangular lattice antiferromagnet.@xcite the effective action obtained by this method has the bulk action @xmath337 and an impurity term which descends from its u(1 ) charge @xmath338 here the coefficient @xmath339 is proportional to the impurity charge @xmath8 , but the value of @xmath339 is not quantized .",
    "an initial derivation does not immediately yield the @xmath340 term , but it is clearly allowed by the symmetries and is evidently more relevant than the @xmath339 term : it represents a potential scattering term for the bulk spinons .",
    "the critical point of the bulk theory alone is a cft , and it is expected that the @xmath341 are irrelevant at this critical point , leading to global o(@xmath342 ) symmetry @xcite . however , as we will see below , the perturbations in @xmath19 are not exactly marginal .",
    "it is useful to compare this theory with that of the recent work of florens _",
    "et al._@xcite unlike us , they include an explicit spin degree of freedom at the impurity . in our approach",
    ", such a situation would be appropriate when the couplings @xmath343 are large enough to bind a spinon in the ground state at the impurity . in a @xmath3 spin liquid ,",
    "there are no long range gauge forces ( the @xmath3 gauge forces are short range ) , unlike the situation in section  [ sec : bind ] , and so it is not required that the ground state have non - zero spin for a vacancy impurity , _",
    "e.g. , _ zn on a cu site . for a magnetic impurity , such as ni on a cu site",
    ", a finite spin ground state may be more likely , but is also not required when the bulk system is in a gapped @xmath3 spin liquid .",
    "we will restrict our discussion here to the small @xmath343 region of ( [ z2])+([z2imp ] ) , and this is equivalent to being in the kondo - screened phases of florens _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "let us now describe the phases of @xmath344 as the value of the tuning parameter is scanned .    for @xmath54 , we have the gapped spin liquid phase in the bulk . the bulk spinons will experience a potential from the @xmath343 terms , and in the attractive case in @xmath89 , such a potential always has a bound state .",
    "however , the binding energy can be less than the bulk spin gap , and hence the ground state remains a singlet and the spin - gap is preserved .",
    "all magnetic response functions will therefore be exponentially small at low @xmath29 .    at the bulk critical point",
    ", we need to examine the scaling dimensions of the perturbations in @xmath19 . in the @xmath143 expansion ,",
    "simple power - counting shows that both @xmath343 are irrelevant . consequently , we do not expect a curie spin susceptibility , but a suppressed response determined by the scaling dimensions of @xmath343 . in the @xmath345",
    "expansion,@xcite we work with the constraint @xmath346 , and hence the @xmath340 term disappears .",
    "the @xmath339 term is marginal at the tree level , and a more complete renormalization group analysis is needed to understand the flow of @xmath347 ; this , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .    finally ,",
    "for @xmath53 , in the magnetically ordered phase with collinear order , we can carry out an analysis of the magnetic properties as in section  [ sec : neel ] .",
    "we apply the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ zpsi ] ) to @xmath348 above , and compute all physical properties as a perturbation series in @xmath201 , @xmath341 and @xmath343 .",
    "the result shows that a spatial dependence of the non - collinear order and the uniform ( ferromagnetic ) magnetization is induced near the impurity by @xmath343 .",
    "the uniform magnetization requires the ` particle - hole ' symmetry breaking term @xmath339 , and is non - zero even in the absence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "however , unlike the situation in section  [ sec : neel ] , this ferromagnetic moment is not quantized , and takes a value dependent upon the bare values of the couplings : this is because spin rotation symmetry is completely broken in the non - collinear ordered phase.@xcite",
    "let us summarize the basic physical characteristics of the impurity response of the various spin liquid states considered in this paper :    _ ( i ) nel - vbs transition : _ the impurity characteristics across this transition are qualitatively very similar to those found for impurities in confining antiferromagnets , @xcite although the underlying field theory is quite different , as are all the exponents and scaling functions .",
    "the spin - gap phase has the conventional curie response of a local moment at the impurity ; for the confining antiferromagnets this local moment is induced by confinement physics , while for the nel - vbs transition it is induced by the logarithmic ` coulomb ' interaction associated with the u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "the nel - vbs quantum critical point has an anomalous curie response , with a curie constant @xmath32 specified in eq .",
    "( [ chi - tot ] ) to leading order in the @xmath143 expansion .",
    "the response of the nel phase is as found in the earlier case : a spatial varying staggered and uniform moment is found near the impurity , with the moment in the latter quantized as in eq .",
    "( [ magtotal ] ) .",
    "the knight shift has both staggered and uniform components , with its behavior in the vicinity of the impurity specified by the impurity exponents determined in section  [ sec : imp ] . at the critical point ,",
    "the induced staggered moment is much stronger than the uniform magnetization component and thus represents the dominating response to an external field .    _",
    "( ii ) staggered flux spin liquid : _ this spin liquid is generically critical , and so has an anomalous curie response ; the curie constant is given , to the leading order in the @xmath60 expansion , by eq .",
    "( [ sfc ] ) .",
    "the knight shift now has only a uniform component , but no staggered component in the scaling limit .",
    "the absence of any staggered knight shift is a defining characteristic of the sf spin liquid , and is a consequence of its large emergent symmetry.@xcite there is a large number of competing order parameters , and the leading impurity action @xmath19 has no natural way of choosing among them , leading to a response which is restricted to the ferromagnetic moment alone .",
    "the behavior of the ferromagnetic knight shift upon approaching the impurity is specified by the impurity exponent ( [ delta - imp - sf ] ) found in section  [ sec : imp2 ] ; to the leading order in @xmath60 , the fourier transform of the ferromagnetic knight shift is computed in sect .",
    "[ sec : sfuni ] .    _",
    "( iii ) spinon fermi surface : _ this case has a finite magnetic response as @xmath349 , unlike the divergent curie susceptibility of the sf phase .",
    "the response decays with a power law away from the impurity , with the dominant response being at the @xmath332 wavevector .    _",
    "( iv ) @xmath3 spin liquid : _ the spin liquid itself has an exponentially suppressed impurity response , because the spin gap is preserved in the presence of the impurity .",
    "the proximate ordered non - collinear state has a response similar to that of the nel state , but with no quantization of the total magnetization .",
    "apart from their applications to spin liquids , the results in section  [ sec : sf ] also have a direct application to the physics of charged impurities in two - dimensional graphene .",
    "it is well known that the low energy electronic excitations in graphene are described by 2 species of dirac fermions .",
    "there is no fluctuating gauge field @xmath10 as in eq .",
    "( [ diracaction ] ) .",
    "however in the presence of charged impurity , the _ three - dimensional _ coulomb potential the electrons experience has the form @xmath350 , where @xmath351 is a constant .",
    "interestingly , this is exactly the form of the static potential found in section  [ sec : sf ] in the presence of an impurity , where @xmath352 .",
    "thus , as long as we ignore quantum - electrodynamic loop corrections , the results of section  [ sec : sf ] apply also to graphene ; specifically , in fig .  [ fig : psi ] , ( a ) and ( b ) apply to graphene while ( c)-(h ) do not .",
    "one of our important results for this system was eq .",
    "( [ psi0 ] ) : that the induced charge density due to the coulomb potential is a delta function , with @xmath8 a non - trivial universal function of @xmath351 .",
    "this results therefore applies also to graphene .",
    "it disagrees with the earlier result of ref .  , which found a @xmath353 decay in the induced charge density .",
    "we believe their results suffers from a cavalier treatment of the ultraviolet cutoff , which does not preserve gauge invariance .      for the sf and @xmath24 spin liquids , an alternative @xmath60 ( or respectively @xmath58 ) expansion could give a useful complementary picture .",
    "we have used an expansion here in which the @xmath354 was taken at fixed @xmath8 . however , it is also possible to study the limit @xmath355 limit at fixed @xmath356 .",
    "the saddle - point equations are straightforward to obtain for this case , but much more difficult to solve : they have the advantage of including the spinon - impurity ` coulomb ' interaction at all orders already at @xmath357 , and so allow for spinon states below , or at the edge of , the bulk spinon continuum .",
    "we will report on the results of such an analysis in future work .    it would also be useful to have a more complete understanding of the spinon fermi surface case , by extending the work of refs .   to determine the gauge - invariant response functions near a single impurity .",
    "for the cuprates , nmr experiments@xcite show a large knight shift response at the nel wavevector in the vicinity of the impurity , and strong temperature - dependent enhancement of such correlations .",
    "these features are consistent with the nel - vbs transition considered in section  [ sec : cpn ] , but also with the transition in dimerized antiferromagnets considered earlier.@xcite the absence of a staggered response for the sf case is potentially a serious deficiency of the model of section  [ sec : sf ] .",
    "it remains to be seen if corrections to scaling ( such as those in eq .",
    "( [ vpert ] ) ) can remedy the situation .    for the organic mott insulator @xmath4-(et)@xmath5cu@xmath5(cn)@xmath6 ,",
    "the nmr knight shift @xcite has an appreciable @xmath29 independent component at low @xmath29 .",
    "this can potentially be fit either by the spinon fermi surface , or by a weakly magnetically ordered state .",
