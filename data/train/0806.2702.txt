    "the data analysis of interferometric gravitational waves ( gws ) detectors has recently been started ( for the current status of gws interferometers see @xcite ) and the scientific community aims in a first direct detection of gws in next years .",
    "detectors for gws will be important for a better knowledge of the universe and also to confirm or ruling out the physical consistency of general relativity or of any other theory of gravitation @xcite .",
    "this is because , in the context of extended theories of gravity , some differences between general relativity and the others theories can be pointed out starting by the linearized theory of gravity @xcite . in this picture , detectors for gws are in principle sensitive also to a hypotetical _ scalar _ component of gravitational radiation , that appears in extended theories of gravity like scalar - tensor gravity , high order theories @xcite and brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "recently , arising from an enlighting analysis of baskaran and grishchuk in @xcite , some papers in the literature have shown the presence and importance of the so - called `` magnetic '' components of gws , which have to be taken into account in the context of the total response functions of interferometers for gws propagating from arbitrary directions . in @xcite and @xcite accurate response functions for the virgo and ligo interferometers have been analysed .    however , some results which have been shown in @xcite look in contrast with the results which have been shown in@xcite .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was claimed that the `` magnetic '' component of gws could , in principle , extend the frequency range of earth based interferometers , while in @xcite such a possibility has been banned .",
    "this contrast has been partially solved in @xcite__. _ _",
    "the aim of this review paper is to re - analyse all the framework of the `` magnetic '' components of gws with the goal of solving the mentioned contrast in definitive way .",
    "accurate response funtions for the virgo and ligo interferometers will be re - discussed in detail too .",
    "in a laboratory enviroment on earth , the coordinate system in which the space - time is locally flat is typically used and the distance between any two points is given simply by the difference in their coordinates in the sense of newtonian physics @xcite . in this frame , called the frame of the local observer , gws manifest themself by exerting tidal forces on the masses ( the mirror and the beam - splitter in the case of an interferometer , see figure 1 ) .",
    "recently , the presence and importance of the so - called magnetic components of gws have been shown by baskaran and grishchuk that computed the correspondent detector patterns in the low - frequencies approximation @xcite . then , more detailed angular and frequency dependences of the response functions for the magnetic components has been given in the same approximation , with a specific application to the parameters of the ligo and virgo interferometers in @xcite .",
    "the most important goal of this review paper is to solve in a definitive way the contrast between @xcite and @xcite on the possibility of extending the frequency - band of interferometers .    before starting with the analysis of the response functions ,",
    "a brief review of section 3 of @xcite is due to understand the importance of the `` magnetic '' components of gws . in this review paper",

    "it is well known from @xcite that the linear and quadratic terms , as powers of @xmath16 , are unambiguously determined by the conditions of the frame of the local observer , while the cubic and higher - order corrections are not determined by these conditions .",
