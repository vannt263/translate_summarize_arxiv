    "the solid line shows the double gaussian fitting curves ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 with 1@xmath7 confidence level , respectively ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the bimodal distribution is coincidence with the result of bayesian statistical method based on the data of dns and ns - wd systems as showed by kiziltan et al .",
    "this has strongly supported the idea that the recycled msp become more massive ( @xmath8 ) than those in less recycled pulsar via the accretion phase in recycling process .        to discriminate clearly",
    "whether this result is due to the selection effect or different evolution scenario , we set a characteristic spin period ( @xmath9 = 20 ms ) which helps us to divide all the sources into two groups : msps with @xmath10 and less recycled pulsars with @xmath11 ( zhang et al .",
    "we find that the average distribution of msps is @xmath12 while in less recycled pulsar is @xmath13 .",

    "furthermore , the large deviation of the msp distribution could be reduced if we invoke the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) in wds , since the aic is expected to produce normal nss , which in binaries can evolve into msps through the usual recycling scenario .",
    "the simulation results of the average masses show that the msps are heavier than those in less recycled pulsars .",
