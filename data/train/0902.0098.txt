    "the density functional theory ( dft ) in its non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite realizations is a standard tool of modern nuclear structure studies .",
    "however , providing global description of atomic nuclei , it still suffers from the fact that many channels of effective interaction are not uniquely defined : this is a reason for a large variety of the dft parametrizations , the quality of many of which is poorly known .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction and the time - odd mean fields are of particular interest in this context , since there are considerable variations for these quantities ( see , for example , refs .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction plays a crucial role in the definition of the shell structure of nuclei , and , thus its accurate description is required so that theoretical tools have predictive power for nuclei beyond known regions .",
    "the time - odd mean fields ( or nuclear magnetism ( nm ) in the language of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @xcite ) contribute to the single - particle hamiltonian only in situations where the intrinsic time - reversal symmetry is broken and kramers degeneracy of time - reversal counterparts of the single - particle levels is removed .",

    "later this procedure ( called as ts - method in this manuscript , where ts refers to terminating states ) has been used in the analysis of terminating states in this mass region within the rmf theory @xcite which is one of the versions of covariant density functional ( cdft ) theory @xcite .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite claim that the ts - method is free from the drawbacks of standard methods of defining spin - orbit interaction based on measuring the single - particle energies of the spin - orbit partner orbitals in spherical nuclei . as a consequence",
    ", it is stated that it allows to define very accurately both isoscalar and isovector channels of spin - orbit interaction @xcite ; the feature which was impossible in the previously existing methods .",
    "the conclusions obtained within the ts - method are drastically different from the ones previously obtained in the sdft and rmf frameworks . for example , based on the comparison of the calculated and experimental energies of spin - orbit partner orbitals , it was shown in ref .  @xcite that the experimental spin - orbit splittings are better reproduced in the rmf approach than in the sdft ( see fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the contrary , the results obtained in refs .",

    "considering the conflict of these results and the importance of the spin - orbit interaction in nuclei it is necessary to understand to which extent the basis of the suggested ts - method is sound and justified .",

    "previous dft investigations of the modifications of the moments of inertia @xcite and single - particle properties @xcite in rotating nuclei caused by the time - odd mean fields ( nuclear magnetism ) were restricted to the superdeformed ( sd ) bands .",
    "however , these bands are far away from the termination and are characterized by a relatively stable deformation . in order to understand how nm affects the properties of the terminating bands ,",
    "the ground state configuration in @xmath8ne has been studied .",
    "this band is a classical example of band termination @xcite .",
    "it has the @xmath9 configuration relative to the @xmath10o core with maximum spin @xmath11 .",
    "the selection of this configuration has been guided by its simplicity , which allows us to understand the role of time - odd mean fields in terminating bands in greater details .",
    "although the terminating bands were observed also in heavier nuclei , it is difficult to trace them from low spin up to band termination in the self - consistent approaches @xcite without special techniques such as used in the cranked nilsson - strutinsky ( cns ) approach @xcite .     in the ground state band of @xmath8ne .",
    "the results obtained with and without nuclear magnetism are presented .",
    "note that the band termination takes place at rotational frequency above which the subsequent increase of rotational frequency does not modify neither total angular momentum nor total binding energy .",
    "this point also corresponds to @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-spin]c ) .",
    "[ ne20-freq],width=302 ]    the investigation of nm in @xmath8ne has been carried out within the framework of the cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) theory @xcite following the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , where similar study has been performed for the yrast sd band in @xmath13dy . in the crmf calculations of this manuscript , all fermionic and bosonic states belonging to the shells up to @xmath14 and @xmath15 are taken into account in the diagonalization of the dirac equation and the matrix inversion of the klein - gordon equation , respectively .",
    "the detailed investigation indicates that this truncation scheme provides very good numerical accuracy .",
    "the nl1 @xcite parametrization of the rmf lagrangian is employed in the study of @xmath8ne , while the studies of terminating states in the @xmath7 mass region ( sects .",

    "the band crossing caused by the interaction of the @xmath19 signatures of the [ 220]1/2 and [ 211]3/2 orbitals both in the proton and neutron subsystems takes place at lower frequency in the calculations with nm ; this is in line with previous finding that the nm shifts the band crossing frequencies @xcite .",
    "the nm also increases the moments of inertia before band crossing ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-freq]c , d ) ; similar effect has been seen before in the sd bands ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it also leads to a faster alignment of angular momentum with rotational frequency ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-freq]a ) ; full alignment at @xmath11 corresponding to band termination takes place at lower frequency in the calculations with nm .    in the context of study of terminating states",
    "two results are important .",
    "first , at the band termination the nm does not modify neither total angular momentum ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-freq]a ) nor the expectation values of the single - particle angular momenta @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ne20-jx ] ) . at lower frequency , the impact of nm on @xmath20 is similar to the one previously studied in the sd band of @xmath13dy @xcite , and , thus , it will not be discussed in detail .",
    "however , one should mention that when analyzing the impact of nm on @xmath20 , the region of band crossing and the region close to the band termination have to be excluded from consideration because considerable differences in the deformations of the nm and wnm solutions at given frequency distort their comparison .",
    "second , the nm provides an additional binding to the energies of the specific configuration and this additional binding increases with spin and has its maximum exactly at the terminating state ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-freq]b and [ ne20-spin]d ) ) .",
    "this suggests that the terminating states can be an interesting probe of the time - odd mean fields _ provided that other effects can be reliably isolated . _    when the results of the nm and wnm calculations are compared as a function of total angular momentum , one can see that the quadrupole deformation @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-spin]a ) , mass hexadecapole moment @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-spin]b ) , and @xmath23-deformation ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-spin]c ) are almost the same in both calculations .",
    "the only difference is seen in the total binding energies ( fig .",
    "[ ne20-spin]d ) , where the nm solution is more bound than the wnm solution .",
    "these results give a hint why the cranked models based on the phenomenological potentials like woods - saxon or nilsson , which do not include time - odd mean fields @xcite , are so successful in the description of experimental data .",
    "when considered as a function of spin the deformation properties of the rotating system are only weakly affected by the time - odd mean fields , and the proper renormalization of the moments of inertia @xcite takes care of the @xmath16 versus angular momentum curve .     of the neutron orbitals occupied at low frequency in the ground state configuration of @xmath8ne given along the deformation path of this configuration .",
