    "much attention in condensed - matter physics is currently directed towards understanding electronic properties of dirac fermions in three dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators ( tis ) , which challenge fundamental concepts and hold a great potential for electronic , optic and optoelectronic applications , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently nonlinear high frequency electron transport phenomena  @xcite in ti systems have attracted growing interest .",
    "there have been many theoretical and experimental works in the past few years on the helicity controlled photocurrents  @xcite , linear photogalvanic effect  @xcite , local photocurrents  @xcite , edge photocurrents in 2d ti  @xcite , coherent control of injection currents  @xcite , photon drag currents  @xcite , second harmonic generation  @xcite , photo - induced quantum hall insulators  @xcite , cyclotron resonance assisted photocurrents @xcite , quantum oscillations of photocurrents@xcite , photogalvanic currents via proximity interactions with magnetic materials  @xcite and photoelectromagnetic effect  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena , scaling in the second or third order of the radiation electric fields , open up new opportunities to the study of dirac fermions , as it has been already demonstrated for graphene , for review see ref .  , and",
    "several ti materials , see e.g. ref .  .",
    "an important advantage of the nonlinear high frequency transport effects is that some of them , being forbidden by symmetry in the bulk of most 3d ti , can be applied to selectively probe the surface states even in ti materials with a finite bulk conductivity . utilizing photocurrents this advantage has been used to study sb@xmath5te@xmath6 and bi@xmath5te@xmath6 3d tis  @xcite , in which conventional _ dc _ transport experiments , particularly at room temperature , are handicapped by a large residual bulk charge carrier density  @xcite .    it has been shown in ref .   that the photocurrent excited by normal incident terahertz ( thz ) radiation is generated due to the photogalvanic effect .",
    "the latter originated from the asymmetric scattering of dirac fermions driven back and forth by the _",
    "ac _ electric field and is allowed in the non - centrosymmetric surface states only .",
    "the experiments further hinted at a possible contribution of the photon drag effect - a competing photocurrent resulting from the light momentum transfer to charged carriers .",
    "however , no experiments which provide clear evidence of the photon drag effect in ti materials have been reported so far .    here",
    "we report on the observation of the photon drag effect in ( bi@xmath0sb@xmath1)@xmath2te@xmath3 3d tis excited by thz radiation . we demonstrate that while at normal incidence the photocurrent is dominated by the photogalvanic effect , at oblique incidence it is outweighed by the photon drag effect .",
    "the latter is shown to be caused by the _ in - plane _ component of the photon wavevector @xmath7 . strikingly",
    ", the observed photon drag current does not change its sign upon inverting @xmath7 .",
    "this , seemingly surprising result , is caused by the fact that in materials with trigonal symmetry the photon drag current is proportional not only to the photon wavevector but also to the product of _",
    "in- _ and _ out - of - plane _ components of the radiation electric field . since both ,",
