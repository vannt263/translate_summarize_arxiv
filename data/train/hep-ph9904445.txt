    "further precise measurement of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon , conventionally denoted as @xmath2 , is now underway at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) .",
    "the perspective for the goal of this experiment is @xcite @xmath3 the recent report for its test - running course at bnl @xcite combined with the previous one at cern @xcite gives to muon @xmath0 @xmath4 where the numerals in the parenthesis represent the uncertainty in the final few digits .",
    "thus the precision ( [ eq : future - precision ] ) amounts to the determination of its value by one further digit .",
    "+ our primary interest is what we can learn when invoking such a improvement in muon @xmath0 experiment . at present",
    "the standard model predicts @xmath5 which includes the up - dated estimate on the leading hadronic vacuum polarization contribution @xcite , ( see @xcite due to analysis without recourse to @xmath6 decay data ) , and @xmath7 contribution @xcite . the designed precision ( [ eq : future - precision ] ) is put forward to find out the existence of the @xmath8 , @xmath1 boson effect to muon @xmath0 @xcite @xmath9 the electron @xmath0 does not receive observable effects from @xmath1 and @xmath8 bosons and are entirely saturated by qed effect",
    "this fact enables us to find out the validity of calculation scheme of quantum field theory , including the perturbative renormalization procedure .",
    "rather electron @xmath0 provides the most accurate determination of the fine structure constant @xmath10 @xcite at present . from ( [ eq : weak_effect ] ) and ( [ eq : future - precision ] ) , the muon @xmath0 is expected not only to obtain a conceivable evidence for such a structure about the electroweak interactions as involved in standard model , but also has the potential to indicate the existence of much richer ingredient associated with some theoretical problem .",
    "+ when we incline to use muon @xmath0 as a probe of new physics , the theme of the talk assigned to me as well , it would be important to recall the motivation or the merits of each model .",
    "thus , here , i will focus on two concrete models considered to approach to  hierarchy problem  , although it is somewhat a conceptual viewpoint . here  hierarchy problem ",
    "stands for the following question in some narrow sense ; what is assuring the stability of the electroweak scale , represented by @xmath8 boson mass , @xmath11 , against quantum fluctuation associated with high momentum modes below some cutoff scale .",
    "the cutoff scale here is the scale at which the gauge interactions appearing in standard model would become subject to some kind of modification",
    ". it may be the gut scale @xmath12 , at which the standard model gauge symmetry group is merged into a larger symmetry group .",
    "or it may be the scale at which the gauge boson is resolved into more fundamental structure , for instance , into string .",
    "+ here we take up two models considered with such a motivation .",
    "one is tev scale gravity discussed in the next section , and the other supersymmetry in sec .",
    "[ sec : susy ] .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] concludes with remark on several facets for muon @xmath0 to probe new physics practically .",
    "the laboratory experiments check the structure of gravity has been met up to the order of millimeters . with this in mind let us turn our attention to the scheme introduced a couple of years ago @xcite",
    ". + let us imagine that our world is confined in a three - brane , the extended object with three - spatial directions , flowing in a higher dimensional space ( @xmath13-dimension in total ) .",
    "these @xmath14-directions are compactified to an @xmath14-dimensional torus with the same length @xmath15 , for simplicity .",
    "then there are an infinite tower of kaluza - klein states from the four - dimensional space - time point of view .",
    "they are the states with non - zero momentum in the extra directions . in four - dimensional world",
    "such a momentum appears as the mass , the scale of which is characterized by inverse of @xmath16 .",
    "+ the behavior of static potential between two point - like sources prepared with separation @xmath17 illustrates an important aspect of the present setting @xcite . when @xmath17 is large compared to @xmath16 , the potential behaves as @xmath18 , nothing but the form of the usual newtonian one .",
    "the planck scale @xmath19 characterizes its strength .",
    "however , once the separation @xmath17 reaches below @xmath16 , the probability that kaluza - klein states get excited can not become neglected any more . thus counting those states which propagate essentially like massless states between two sources leads @xmath20 as @xmath17-dependence of the potential at short distance , characteristic of @xmath21-spatial dimension .",
    "this only reflects the fact that the local structure less than the compactification scale is that of @xmath13-dimensional space - time .",
    "a noteworthy point is that the strength of force is then characterized by another planck scale , @xmath22 ; @xmath23 this is the strength of the gravitational interaction in the bulk theory , the fundamental planck scale .",
    "+ now we take @xmath16 equal to 1 mm , through @xmath24 ] which corresponds to the length scale one - order less than the current reach of the experiment on gravity . with two extra compactified directions",
    "@xmath22 = 1 tev .",
    "= 1 tev , which he heard at the seminar by arkani - hamed @xcite . ]",
    "+ if the three - brane were further of dirichlet - brane type , on which the open string can attach , our standard model gauge bosons would become the tangential component of the ground state of such an open string .",
    "then the gauge bosons would get resolve into strings higher than 1 tev as long as the string coupling constant is of order unity .",
    "thus there is no hierarchy problem ab initio .",
    "+ at present we are lacking the precise formulation of theories and the detail knowledge on its dynamical aspects ( especially on the compactification mechanism ) .",
    "however the dimension counting argument with symmetry consideration has been an enough tool when we estimate the order of magnitude about some effect in low energy phenomena unless the effective theory description breaks down , although we rather expect to superstring theory that many miracles beyond this assumption occur .",
    "+ the argument begins with the chiral symmetry for muon .",
    "when muon was massless , the magnetic dipole coupling would be absent .",
    "thus the magnitude of magnetic moment will be proportional to muon mass @xmath25 and the corresponding operator appears in the effective lagrangian : @xmath26 with the the extra effect @xmath27 due to the new structure characterized by mass scale @xmath22 . since the mass dimension of @xmath27 turns out to be minus one in four space - time dimension , the dimension counting now gives @xmath28 with the numerical constant @xmath29 of order unity .",
    "insertion of ( [ eq : a_const ] ) into the effective interaction ( [ eq : muon_dipole ] ) with a slight rearrangement yields @xmath30\\ ,    \\bar{\\mu } i\\sigma^{\\lambda\\rho } f_{\\lambda\\rho}\\,\\mu.\\ ] ] the quantity found in the square bracket of the above expression corresponds to the additional contribution to @xmath31 due to the presence of tev scale gravity .",
    "thus the additional effect to @xmath31 can be read off as @xmath32 which becomes for @xmath22 = 1 tev @xmath33 thus a crude estimate shows that the effect from tev scale gravity is in the marginal situation to be detected even with the current accuracy ( [ eq : present_value ] ) .",
    "the future accuracy ( [ eq : future - precision ] ) is quite adequate to detect the existence of new aspect of gravity characterized by tev scale .",
    "now we will take our attention to the search of supersymmetry with the use of muon @xmath0 , which has been discussed as a machinary to check the various adovocated models or from some generic standpoint @xcite .",
    "the detail formula and so on in this section will also be found in a separate literature @xcite .",
    "+ in the narrow sense of the  hierarchy problem  defined in the introductory remark , supersymmetry makes it possible to extend the standard model gauge group into the larger gauge group in grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "this is realized in the form of the cancellation of the dangerous quantum corrections within each supermultiplet .",
    "the bosonic partner of muon , for instance , has not been observed yet so that it must be much heavier .",
    "smuon can be let heavier by giving it a lifting - up mass , @xmath34 .",
    "this procedure does not spoil quantum stability as far as @xmath34 is not so apart from the electroweak scale .",
    "the scale @xmath34 works as the ultraviolet cutoff scale for the phenomena accessed by low momentum probe while it works as the infrared cutoff from the supersymmetric high - energy side .",
    "it has been recognized that unification of the coupling constants of three gauge interactions , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and color @xmath37 , is achieved by assuming the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric extension of standard model above such @xmath34 . for the future purposes it deserves to recall here that the knowledge from precise measurement around @xmath1 pole plays an indispensable role to establish this fact .",
    "+ now we examine the effect on muon @xmath0 induced from supersymmetric theories .",
    "they come essentially from two diagrams .",
    "one is the chargino - sneutrino loop , where the charginos are the admixture of @xmath38 gaugino @xmath39 and the charged higgsino .",
    "the other is the neutralino - smuon loop , where the neutralinos are the admixture of their neutral counterparts .",
    "the other contributions , such as the charged higgs loop one , are so small that they are irrelevant even for future study .",
    "[ fig : g-2_50_200 ] is intended to demonstrate what magnitude of those effects to muon @xmath0 is expected .",
    "the figure shows the supersymmetric contribution to muon @xmath0 as a function of @xmath40 parameter ( the supersymmetric mass common to two higgs supermultiplets ) , for relatively large @xmath41 ( the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of two higgs doublets ) , the supersymmetry breaking slepton mass set equal to 200 gev , and for three choices of supersymmetry breaking @xmath42 gaugino mass @xmath43 with @xmath44 gaugino mass given here through the gut relation @xmath45 as the weak effect is @xmath46 , the supersymmetric effect can become substantial .",
    "actually the muon @xmath0 even with the current accuracy excludes the region of negative sign of @xmath40 for this set of the other parameters .",
    "[ fig : g-2_50_200 ] is drawn without paying any attention to the other constraints on supersymmetric models already present .",
    "the direct search of superpartners of the known species puts the lowest bound ( 93 gev ) to the lightest chargino mass , and the bound ( 78 gev ) to the mass of each lighter slepton @xcite .",
    "in fact the chargino mass bound requires that the absolute magnitude of @xmath40 parameter be greater than about 100 gev for the gaugino mass in our interest , while the slepton mass bound demands @xmath47 less than about 400 gev . with those regions excluded fig .",
    "[ fig : cnt_50_200 ] shows the contours each of which has equal magnitude of muon @xmath0 on the @xmath40-@xmath43 plane . since the future accuracy is much smaller than the interval between the neighboring contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnt_50_200 ] , we have a great chance to observe a signal coming from the existence of supersymmetry through muon @xmath0 .",
    "+     in @xmath40(horizontal direction)-@xmath43 plane for @xmath48 and @xmath49 gev .",
    "the two islands are the regions escaping from any other constraints .",
    "the contours are drawn with the interval of @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "darker face corresponds to smaller @xmath53 .",
    "]    now we are tempted to grasp the specific feature of muon @xmath0 in search of supersymmetric theory .",
    "it will turn out that muon @xmath0 seems to have a peculiar property which is not shared by any other observables .",
    "+ in the most honest region of parameter space @xmath54 , chargino - sneutrino loop contribution dominates over neutralino - smuon loop contribution .",
    "the current basis analysis helps one to catch up with the qualitative dependence on the various parameters .",
    "as long as @xmath55 , the chirality flips due to the vacuum expectation value @xmath56 of the higgs field giving mass to the up - type quarks , turning @xmath39 to the charged component of @xmath57 , which transformed to the charged @xmath58 due to @xmath40-term .",
    "picking @xmath59 from @xmath56 and @xmath60 from a yukawa - type coupling involving muon , the dominant contribution in the present situation becomes @xmath61 although the overall sign needs a detail computation . from this expression",
    "we can read off such properties that    1 .",
    "the effect to muon @xmath0 is greatly enhanced for large @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "in fact , when @xmath41 is small , the overall magnitude of susy effect is drastically reduced as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : g-2_3_100 ] .",
    "thus in this case the current experiment could not put any restriction on its existence .",
    "but the future accuracy in muon @xmath0 is quite sufficient to explore it .",
    "2 .   the sign of this contribution is govern by the sign of @xmath40 .",
    "it is interesting to remind that a large @xmath41 is a natural consequence of the gauge mediated susy breaking scenario , and elaborate analysis on muon @xmath0 has been performed in this line @xcite . or it is a necessary ingredient for unification of all yukawa coupling constants of the third generation . + as observed at both ends of @xmath40-direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : g-2_3_100 ] , supersymmetric effect to muon @xmath0 does not decouple even if we can let the absolute magnitude of @xmath40 large while those other parameters remain fixed .",
    "note that small @xmath41 case allows relatively large absolute magnitude of @xmath40 parameter without conflicting with slepton mass bound , as the mixing between left- and right - sleptons are proportional to a combination @xmath62 .",
    "+ such a phenomenon can be understood from the following observation .",
    "when @xmath47 is large the chargino - sneutrino effect decouples , but the neutralino - smuon effect increases .",
    "let us consider a diagram in which the chiral flip occurs due to the mixing between the left and right - handed smuons in the current eigen - basis .",
    "as the higgino does not propagate , suppression factor due to the inverse power of @xmath40 is now absent .",
    "thus @xmath53 becomes proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "( the sign is also opposite to the chargino - sneutrino effect ( [ eq : a_susy_1 ] ) . )",
    "this is the reason for such a behavior in this large @xmath47 region .",
    "+ from those observations , muon @xmath0 seems to play the major role to find the sign and the magnitude of @xmath40 term .",
    "as far as i know , such a property sensible to @xmath40 is not shared by any other observables .",
    "recall the following two facts , that is ,    1 .",
    "@xmath40 is a supersymmetric parameter which is associated with common mass of higgs supermultiplet .",
    "thus this is a parameter independent of the supersymmetry breaking parameters by nature .",
    "although supersymmetry assures the quantum stability of electroweak scale , supersymmetry does not set @xmath40 to this region at tree level automatically .",
    "this is the most annoying matter called as",
    " @xmath40 problem .",
    "this problem stands out especially in the context of gut .",
    "thus , once supersymmetry is established also by the other experiments , the determination of @xmath40 parameter through muon @xmath0 may develop further theoretical access to the origin of @xmath40 , the origin of electroweak scale .",
    "+ before addressing to the future testing possibility in the small @xmath41 regime , we remind the additional constraints implied from precision measurement at @xmath1 pole .",
    "as was mentioned , the result of this precision measurement has given an indispensable information to argue grand unification .",
    "it also has killed the naive technicolor models .",
    "thus we should discuss the effect on muon @xmath0 on the region of the parameter space consistent with those measurements .",
    "+ they are summarized by four parameters .",
    "three of these parametrizes the `` oblique '' corrections from new physics , with respect to `` reference '' standard model ; here we take the one specified by @xmath64 the last one is associated with the modification of coupling of bottom quark to @xmath1 boson .",
    "this is neglected here by assuming that the squarks are so heavy enough that their effects decouple . since it has been recognized that the susy effect to @xmath8 boson mass and coupling of @xmath6 to @xmath1 is not relevant within the current accuracy@xcite , we concentrate on @xmath65 and @xmath66 parameters .",
    "-@xmath66 parameters for @xmath67 .",
    "slepton brings @xmath65 parameter to decrease ( each line follows the response to the change of @xmath68 . )",
    "while chargino and neutralino tend to increase it ( each line shows the response to the change of @xmath40 parameter . ) .",
    "therefore they partly cancels when added together ( the line with square dots for @xmath68 = 100 gev , with triangle dots for @xmath68 = 200 gev for @xmath41 = 3 ) . ]",
    "[ fig : st_100 ]     + fig .",
    "[ fig : st_100 ] shows a constraint implied from @xmath65 and @xmath66 parameters .",
    ", @xmath66 themselves here .",
    "] the reference standard model is at the origin on this plane located in the contour of 90 % confidence level .",
    "the slepton contribution brings @xmath65 parameter to negative , while the chargino and neutralino ones to positive .",
    "a set of two lines in the left - hand side pursues the response of the slepton effects to the change of susy breaking slepton mass for two values of @xmath41 ( solid line for @xmath69 , dashed line for @xmath48 . )",
    "the one on the right - hand side follows the response of the chargino effects against the change of @xmath40 parameter .",
    "the solid line with the square ( triangular ) marks represents the locus followed by the sum of the these two contributions for the slepton mass 100 gev ( 200 gev ) and @xmath41 equal to 3 when @xmath40 is changed to about 500 gev .",
    "thus such a parameter set with @xmath70 equal to 3 is allowed at 95 % confidence level .",
    "but in the case of @xmath41 = 50 it is rather difficult to take slepton mass equal to 100 gev .",
    "once the slepton mass is taken larger , for instance , at 200 gev , there is no restriction from this analysis .",
    "+ now for @xmath69 the contour with equal @xmath53 in the @xmath40-@xmath43 plane is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnt_3_100 ] .     in @xmath40-@xmath43 plane for @xmath69 and @xmath71 gev .",

    "now let us turn back to the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "as was mentioned by several talks in this workshop , besides qed contribution , @xmath75 is also dominated by the leading order qcd contribution which arises through the hadronic vacuum polarization .",
    "its improvement is now awaiting for the precise knowledge about the low energy hadron production cross section planned to be accumulated at novosivirsk , frascatti and beijing .",
    "+ the hadronic light - by - light scattering effect @xcite , which requires purely theoretical evaluation , may become an obstacle .",
    "thus the reduction of its error also needs further challenge .",
    "+ to summarize we discussed the effect to muon @xmath0 from two candidates of models each of which accesses to `` hierarchy problem '' .",
    "we found that the potential signatures are expected from the existence of both two candidates by future measurement of muon @xmath0 even on account of the precision measurement at @xmath1 pole .",
