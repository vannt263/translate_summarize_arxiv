    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons are currently observed at a very high rate at the tevatron , with cross sections of the order of a nanobarn , and will be even more copiously produced at the lhc . in such hadronic environments ,",
    "the vector bosons are observed in association with strongly - interacting particles , which are understood in terms of the radiation of additional gluons and quarks in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "much of this radiation is _ soft _ , corresponding to transverse energy deposits of a few gev or less .",
    "however , producing a significant deposit of energy that may be interpreted as a jet of particles originating from a single hard gluon is still fairly common .",
    "nave power counting , with additional gluon radiation suppressed by a factor of @xmath2 , is borne out by more detailed calculations , as illustrated in figure  [ wjt : xsecs ] .",
    "cross sections for a range of basic processes as a function of the center of mass energy , @xmath3 ( adapted from ref .",
    "the lines indicated for @xmath4,@xmath5 jets correspond to jets with @xmath6  gev and @xmath7.,width=306 ]    the cross section for producing a @xmath0 boson together with jets of @xmath6  gev drops by an order of magnitude as each additional jet is considered .",
    "the event rate for producing a @xmath0 and two such jets is still three orders of magnitude larger than the expected total cross section for production of a higgs boson of mass @xmath8  gev . at the lhc ,",
    "events with two very hard jets , of transverse momenta larger than @xmath9  gev , will still be relatively commonplace . with a cross section of a few nanobarns",
    ", they will be produced as frequently as the much softer @xmath10  jet events currently are at the tevatron .",
    "when folding in the decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons , one sees that these types of events can lead to substantial backgrounds to many searches at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the leptonic decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lead to signatures consisting of missing energy , lepton(s ) and jets .",
    "the presence of a lepton is especially important since it can be used to tag the event and thus it is in such decay modes that these channels are most important .",
    "the recent evidence for single top production at the tevatron  @xcite has relied crucially on a good understanding of the @xmath10  jets background when one or both of the jets may contain bottom quarks . furthermore , supersymmetry and other models for new physics provide a plethora of signals identified via missing energy and high transverse momentum jets . to pick just one example ,",
    "a relatively light higgs boson produced in the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) channel may be identified via its decay to tau leptons .",
    "the observed final state , @xmath11  jets , is easily mimicked by @xmath1 boson production  @xcite .    in order to have good control of these backgrounds across a wide range of detector acceptances , it is crucial that they are both well understood and accurately simulated theoretically .",
    "this goal can only be achieved by systematic advances on two fronts : improvement of the theoretical calculations and validation of calculational tools against existing data . as well as",
    "the immediate rewards that may be reaped from such a programme , in the longer term these studies can serve as benchmarks for similar future analyses . in particular , plentiful production of top quark pairs at the lhc will likely necessitate systematic studies of @xmath12  jet events along similar lines .",
    "until recently , the theoretical tools available for comparison with hadron collider data have fallen into two camps : fixed order parton - level calculations and parton shower approaches based on the factorization properties of qcd amplitudes .    working in fixed order in perturbation theory is by now straightforward at leading order ( lo ) , but already limited at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite . at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) very few calculations",
    "have been performed , with existing ones limited to final states containing only one particle .",
    "in addition , the capability of such calculations to model the final states found in the experiments is very limited . at lo each parton in the calculation corresponds to a single jet , with one additional parton per jet allowed for each successive order .",
    "moreover , the number of final state particles that can currently be included in a full nlo calculation is three . despite these flaws ,",
    "the great advantage of these calculations is that they provide a reliable normalization of the cross section ( nlo and beyond ) whose uncertainties can be sensibly estimated ( starting at nnlo ) .    on the other hand the parton shower approach is ideally suited to simulating final states similar to those found in the data which allows , for example , a full analysis of detector effects .",
    "this is possible thanks to the additional radiation that is generated stochastically in the shower , after starting from a given ( usually 1 or 2 particle ) hard final state .",
    "the theory underlying such an approach is based on the factorization of the perturbative matrix elements in the limits of soft and collinear partons .",
    "although the effects of such soft physics are taken into account and well - modelled , hard or large angle radiation is in general poorly described .",
    "in addition , this approach is generally implemented only using lo matrix elements , limiting the trustworthiness of the predictions accordingly .",
    "recently there has been progress on both fronts . at fixed order",
    "there have been many developments aimed at automating nlo calculations so that they may be applied to higher multiplicity final states  @xcite .",
    "regarding parton showers , there have been two major developments in recent years .",
    "the first , generically known as _ matching _ , supplements the traditional parton shower by including hard matrix elements with more partons . in this way ,",
    "the poor approximations usually employed by a parton shower in hard configurations are eliminated by using the exact matrix elements .",
    "the original implementations of such schemes  @xcite have recently spawned further versions  @xcite , although the basic principle remains the same .",
    "the arena of @xmath15+jet simulation has been an ideal testing ground for the idea of matching in parton showers , as we shall discuss shortly .",
    "finally , a major advance in this area has been the inclusion of nlo matrix elements in a parton shower  @xcite . at present",
    "this implementation does not address the issue of @xmath15+jet production , although it is not infeasible in the near future .",
    "whichever matching procedure is used , an artificial parameter must be introduced that serves to discriminate between the regions of hard matrix elements and of collinear approximations .",
    "although predictions should be largely independent of this parameter , if it is not chosen appropriately then the hard matrix elements may not be used when necessary and the inadequacy of the original ( unmatched ) parton shower returns . as an example of the matching procedure applied to @xmath16  jet production",
    ", we refer to the ckkw scheme as implemented in the sherpa  @xcite event generator . in this case",
    "the parameter is the jet resolution cutoff , @xmath17 , and a study of its impact upon the inclusive @xmath1 @xmath18 spectrum is shown in figure  [ wjt : sherpa ] .     the @xmath1 transverse momentum distribution , taken from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=200 ]   the @xmath1 transverse momentum distribution , taken from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=200 ]   the @xmath1 transverse momentum distribution , taken from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=200 ]    the contributions from each set of hard matrix elements",
    "are shown separately , with the upper curve obtained from their sum .",
    "this curve is not only smooth , but relatively stable with respect to the change from @xmath19  gev to @xmath20  gev .",
    "however , for @xmath21  gev the distribution begins to fall off more rapidly at large @xmath18 , indicating that the hard matrix elements are not being effectively utilized .    as well as",
    "such studies of individual generators , recently much work has gone into comparisons of the showering algorithms and matching procedures that are in general use .",
    "the results show that all generators are broadly consistent , with differences that can mostly be accounted for by the usual variation of scales  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the input parameters can be tuned with tevatron data and then the results extrapolated for use at the lhc .    on the side of fixed - order calculations , the pace of developments that _ directly _ confront experimental data has been somewhat slower .",
    "the nnlo corrections to inclusive rates and distributions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production have been known already for five years  @xcite .",
    "this accuracy , leaving residual uncertainties of a few percent , is highly desirable  for example , in order to pin down pdfs or possibly even to serve as a luminosity monitor  @xcite .",
    "the nlo calculation for a final state involving one additional jet was performed a long time ago  @xcite , with the corrections to @xmath22  jet observables known at the same order more recently  @xcite .",
    "the prospect of a nnlo calculation of @xmath23  jet production has become more imminent in the last year , thanks to a pioneering effort to complete the nnlo corrections to the 3-jet rate in @xmath24 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the two processes are related by crossing and , although it is non - trivial to address the difficult issue of doubly - infrared singularities in the hadron collider environment , a clear pathway between the two exists . for now an extension of this approach to tackle the @xmath22  jet calculations at nnlo appears very unlikely and further calculational advances are required . beyond two jets , fixed order calculations",
    "are limited to leading order at present , although this may soon be addressed as one of the plethora of approaches aimed at performing arbitrary multi - leg processes at 1-loop order matures  jets at nlo since this symposium  @xcite ] .",
    "however , for now one must choose between either higher orders in qcd or a parton shower .",
    "a recent comparison of cdf @xmath25  jet data with a variety of these approaches is shown in figure  [ wjt : cdfwjets ]  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 of the first ( left ) and second ( right ) jets in @xmath25jet events , adapted from ref .",
    "the cdf data are normalized to nlo predictions ( top ) , alpgen+herwig with the mlm matching prescription ( middle ) and madgraph+pythia using the ckkw procedure ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   the @xmath26 of the first ( left ) and second ( right ) jets in @xmath25jet events , adapted from ref .",
    "the cdf data are normalized to nlo predictions ( top ) , alpgen+herwig with the mlm matching prescription ( middle ) and madgraph+pythia using the ckkw procedure ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    it appears that , at least for the first two jets , the parton shower approaches do not reproduce the shape of the @xmath26 distributions very well . on the other hand",
    ", the nlo calculation tracks the data reasonably successfully , with deviations largely captured by the combination of scale and pdf uncertainties . of note",
    "is the omission of comparisons of the third and higher jets ; as already noted , for these no nlo prediction is currently available and we must be content with qualitative agreement with the parton shower approaches .    in light of this comparison ,",
    "several open questions remain .",
    "the nlo description appears to excel , but the agreement could be considered too good . at the lowest values of @xmath26",
    "considered one might expect a fixed order calculation to be less accurate , but in fact this is precisely where the nlo calculation agrees best and the parton showers fare worst . at this point",
    "it is instructive to recall that the nlo calculation can not account for the effects of hadronization or the underlying event .",
    "the lack of such information means that the quality of the comparison may be somewhat misleading .",
    "this question can not be satisfactorily answered until a parton shower is developed to nlo accuracy for this final state .",
    "we can hope that , by the time that lhc analyses have reached a similar stage , such a tool is available .",
    "a more immediate diagnostic of the fixed order and parton shower approaches could be provided by a detailed comparison of predictions for observables other than the jet transverse momenta .",
    "these may indicate areas where the theoretical predictions perform particularly badly and could be used to assess the degree to which the nlo agreement might be accidental .    at the lhc similar studies",
    "will no doubt be performed .",
    "it is interesting to note that related processes , such as @xmath27 production , despite being suppressed by a factor of 1,000 compared to the single @xmath0 process , still have cross sections in the region of @xmath9  pb . the rates for emitting additional radiation will again be suppressed by factors of order @xmath28 for each additional jet .",
    "when combined with the large luminosities expected at the lhc , this means that plenty of @xmath29  jet events will be produced .",
    "such events form an irreducible background to various searches for the higgs boson when its mass is large enough for the decay @xmath30 to be significant , notably in the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion channels  @xcite . in the former a jet veto",
    "is often applied to reject other backgrounds , thus focussing on the @xmath31  jets final state . in the latter one",
    "expects the higgs boson to be produced centrally , accompanied by two very forward jets . either both or just one of these jets may be tagged ( to increase the expected signal cross section ) , thus requiring a good knowledge of @xmath32  jet observables .",
    "one could therefore imagine that the breadth of experience accumulated in @xmath25  jet studies could profitably be applied to provide a systematic analysis of @xmath29  jet backgrounds .",
    "on the theoretical side , an extra vector boson means that parton shower ( plus matching ) approaches will require more computational effort , but no new developments . on the side of fixed order , it is quite a different story .",
    "nlo corrections to inclusive @xmath27 production have long been known  @xcite , with corrections to the emission of a single hard jet only very recently computed  @xcite .",
    "again , the promised advances in multi - leg nlo computations could have an immediate impact in this arena .",
    "although the production of heavy flavors ( in particular , bottom and charm quarks ) and the production of light quark jets share many similarities , at a theoretical level they differ in a crucial way . for massless quarks ,",
    "the matrix elements diverge in the soft and collinear limits .",
    "this means that predictions diverge , for example , in the limit that @xmath33 so that a minimum jet @xmath18 and angular separation must be imposed in order to compare with similarly - restricted experimental data . for a massive quark",
    ", its mass @xmath34 serves to regulate the divergence , which instead behaves as @xmath35 .",
    "therefore no cuts are necessary in order to properly define the cross section theoretically , so that it can then be calculated inclusively .",
    "unfortunately , this appealing feature comes at a price : including the mass renders the fixed - order calculations more difficult , which is particularly troublesome when already at the limit of current sophistication ",
    "namely , a vector boson plus two partons .",
    "of course , some analyses do not demand close attention to the low transverse momentum behavior of these cross sections . in that case",
    "it can be sufficient to work in the approximation that the heavy quark is massless .",
    "the applicability of such an approximation is illustrated well by the comparison between two calculations of @xmath36 production , as shown in figure  [ wjt : wbbcomp ]  @xcite .    when applying typical jet cuts , the most recent calculation that includes the mass of the @xmath37-quark differs from an earlier one for @xmath38 by less than @xmath39 in the total cross section ( i.e. a difference of order @xmath40 ) . as seen in the right panel , this deviation is due entirely to the behavior in the threshold region that can not possibly be captured correctly in the massless calculation .",
    "away from threshold the two agree .    in some instances one can not simply restrict the phase space in this fashion . in particular",
    ", it is often advantageous to tag only one heavy quark in order to improve experimental efficiency ( see for example ref .",
    "in such a scenario the partner anti - quark must be integrated over the whole of the phase space region so that the straightforward massless approach can not be used .",
    "however another technique is suitable in exactly this limit , one that is based on the use of heavy quark parton distribution functions .    at very high center - of - mass energies we are used to the idea that we may become sensitive to heavy quark content of the ( anti-)proton sea .",
    "in fact , we are well used to this approach in the context of @xmath0 production , where the contribution shown in the left diagram of figure  [ wjt : vfsffs ] , dependent on the charm quark distribution , is usually included when calculating the inclusive @xmath0 cross section ( and is responsible for about @xmath41 of the total at the lhc ) .",
    "left : production of a @xmath0 boson via the charm quark distribution function , with an implicit anti - charm quark integrated out . such a diagram",
    "is included in the `` variable flavor scheme '' ( vfs ) when the anti - charm quark is not relevant to the analysis .",
    "right : production of a @xmath0 boson and an anti - charm quark via an initial state gluon splitting , @xmath42 .",
    "if the anti - charm quark is subsequently integrated out , this corresponds to the `` fixed flavor scheme '' ( ffs).,title=\"fig:\",width=139 ]   left : production of a @xmath0 boson via the charm quark distribution function , with an implicit anti - charm quark integrated out .",
    "such a diagram is included in the `` variable flavor scheme '' ( vfs ) when the anti - charm quark is not relevant to the analysis .",
    "right : production of a @xmath0 boson and an anti - charm quark via an initial state gluon splitting , @xmath42 .",
    "if the anti - charm quark is subsequently integrated out , this corresponds to the `` fixed flavor scheme '' ( ffs).,title=\"fig:\",width=139 ]    the bottom quark distribution is a little less familiar , with its use at the tevatron mainly limited to studies of @xmath43-channel single top production",
    ". however it will be more important at the lhc due to the increased role of the proton sea .",
    "the heavy quark distribution function can be thought of as folding back a gluon splitting into heavy quark pairs , from the matrix elements and into the pdf .",
    "this splitting is shown explicitly in the right - hand diagram of figure  [ wjt : vfsffs ] .",
    "the calculation of these two processes , in the so - called variable flavor scheme ( vfs , left ) and fixed flavor scheme ( ffs , right ) , should therefore agree at some level when information about the additional massive anti - charm quark in the ffs is integrated out .",
    "the two approaches are of course exactly equivalent in the full theory . at a given order of perturbation theory",
    "this is not the case and , in general , they do not agree particularly well at leading order .",
    "each approach has its own advantages and weaknesses , which are summarized in table  [ wjt : vfsffscomp ] .",
