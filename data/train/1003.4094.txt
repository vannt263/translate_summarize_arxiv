    "one of the most significant discoveries in cosmology in recent years is the fact that our universe is currently going through an accelerated expansion phase@xcite .",
    "this can have far reaching implications for fundamental theories of physics .",
    "this late time acceleration of the universe can be due to the presence of an exotic fluid with large negative pressure known as _ dark energy _ or due to the modification of gravity itself .",
    "the simplest candidate of dark energy is provided by cosmological constant @xmath0 with equation of state parameter @xmath1 .",
    "however , the @xmath0cdm model is plagued with fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problems ( see @xcite for a nice review ) .",
    "scalar field models mimicking a variable @xmath0 can alleviate the fine tuning and coincidence problems and provide an interesting alternative to cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "these scalar field models can be broadly classified into two categories depending upon the form of their potentials : fast roll and slow roll models termed as freezing and thawing models in the literature@xcite . in case of fast roll models , the potential is steep resulting the scalar field to track the background fluid and",
    "is sub dominant for most of the evolution history . only at late times",
    ", the field becomes dominant and drives the acceleration of the universe .",
    "such solutions are also known as _",
    "then there are the slow - roll models for which the field kinetic energy is much smaller than its potential energy .",
    "usually it has sufficiently flat potential similar to an inflaton . at early times , the field is nearly frozen at @xmath1 due to the large hubble friction .",
    "its energy density is nearly constant with a negligible contribution to the total energy density of the universe .",
    "but as radiation / matter rapidly dilutes due to the expansion of the universe and the background energy density becomes comparable to scalar field energy density , the field breaks away from its frozen state and evolves slowly to the region with @xmath2 .",
    "however , in this case , the model needs some degree of fine tuning of the initial conditions in order to achieve a viable late time evolution .",
    "recent observations suggest that the equation of state parameter for dark energy does not significantly deviate from @xmath1 around the present epoch @xcite .",
    "this type of equation of state can be easily obtained in dynamical models represented by thawing scalar fields .",
    "motivated by this fact , scherrer and sen @xcite examined quintessence models with nearly flat potentials satisfying the slow - roll conditions .",
    "it was shown that under the slow - roll conditions , a scalar field with a variety of potentials @xmath3 evolves in a similar fashion and one can derive a generic expression for the equation of state for all such scalar fields .",
    "similar results were later established for the case of phantom @xcite and tachyon scalar fields @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that under slow - roll conditions , all of them have identical equation of state and hence can not be distinguished , atleast , at the level of background cosmology .",
    "the crucial assumption for arriving at this important conclusion was the fulfillment of the slow - roll conditions for the field potentials .",
    "in a recent paper by sen et al .",
    "@xcite , assumption of slow roll has been relaxed , but it was assumed that the scalar field is of thawing type i.e it is initially frozen at @xmath1 due to large hubble damping . with these choices",
    "the evolution of a variety of scalar field models having both canonical and non - canonical kinetic terms have been studied .",
    "observational quantities like hubble parameter , luminosity distance and quantities related to the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement have been studied for variety of potentials .",
    "it was shown that given the current error bars for different observational data related with background cosmology , it is difficult to distinguish different thawing models from @xmath0cdm .",
    "it was also shown that lower the value of @xmath4 parameter , higher the chance to distinguish and there is a redshift range between @xmath5 where the deviation from @xmath0cdm is maximum irrespective of the model considered .",
    "dark energy not only affects background expansion rate and thereby modifying the observables like distance - redshift relation , it also affects the growth of structure . on large scales , dark energy also clusters which in turn affects the matter clustering .",
    "but at small scales , although dark energy is more or less smoothly distributed , it provides an extra hubble drag thereby slowing down the growth rate of matter perturbations .",
    "the behavior of linear perturbation in a scalar field and its effect on large scale structure of the universe have been studied by a number of authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the impact has been studied for cosmic microwave background @xcite , galaxy redshift surveys ( @xcite ) , cross - correlation of the integrated sachs - wolf effect @xciteas well as in neutral hydrogen surveys @xcite .    in the non - linear regime",
    "one has to perform n - body simulations to accurately measure the effect of dark energy on the clustering properties of matter and this has been investigated in a number of papers @xcite . the simplest analytical approach to study",
    "the nonlinear clustering of matter is the spherical collapse formalism first developed by gunn and gott @xcite .",
    "it describes how a small spherical over density decouples from the background evolution , slows down , then eventually turns around and collapses .",
    "it is generally assumed that the collapse is not complete so the system does not reach the singularity , instead it eventually virializes and stabilizes to a finite size . combining this with the press - schechter formalism @xcite",
    ", one can have a model for formation of structures which predicts the abundances of virialized objects as a function of mass .",
    "this model can give insight into the physics of structure formation which can be ultimately used for a detailed n - body simulation .",
    "there are numerous studies of the spherical collapse formalism to include both homogeneous and inhomogeneous dark energy @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we systematically study the spherical collapse model for thawing type scalar field dark energy models for various potentials .",
    "we consider the canonical as well as noncanonical kinetic energy for the scalar fields .",
    "we assume the dark energy to be homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous when it also virializes together with matter inside the spherical over density .",
    "we calculate the matter density contrast at turnaround as well as at virialization and compare the result with the corresponding @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the background evolution of thawing dark energy models for ordinary scalar field as well as for tachyons . in section 3",
    "we study the evolution of linear and nonlinear matter density perturbation assuming the dark energy to be homogeneous . in section 4",
    "we describe the spherical collapse formalism for a general scalar field dark energy model and study the virialization process in this scenario and discuss the results obtained .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , thawing dark energy models are characterizedin such a way that in the early universe the scalar field is frozen by very large hubble damping due to the expansion of the universe . as the universe expands the hubble parameter decreases so the hubble damping and the scalar field starts evolving slowly down its potential .",
    "therefore , the equation of state initially starts with @xmath1 and slowly departs from this value in the later time . in this paper",
    "we consider both ordinary scalar field with canonical kinetic term as well as tachyon type scalar field having born - infeld type kinetic term .      in",
    "what follows , we shall assume that the dark energy is described by a minimally - coupled scalar field , @xmath6 , with equation of motion @xmath7 where the hubble parameter @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the total energy density in the universe .",
    "we model a flat universe containing only matter and a scalar field , so that @xmath11 .    equation ( [ motionq ] ) indicates that the field rolls downhill in the potential @xmath3 but its motion is damped by a term proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where the pressure and density of the scalar field have the forms @xmath14    defining @xmath15 and @xmath16 , one can form an autonomous system of equations involving the two observables @xmath17 and @xmath18 together with the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "this is derived by @xciteas @xmath20    given the initial conditions for @xmath21 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 , one can solve this system of equations numerically for different potentials .",
    "we are interested in thawing models i.e models for which the equation of state is initially frozen at @xmath1 .",
    "hence , we take @xmath22 initially for our purpose .",
    "also one has to choose the initial value @xmath23 .",
    "it was earlier shown that if @xmath23 is small ( which is equivalent to assuming the slow - roll conditions similar to inflation ) the scalar field evolution is similar to that of cosmological constant @xmath0 @xcite . here",
    "we assume that the slow - roll conditions are strongly broken i.e @xmath24 in order to have a behavior which is in principle different from @xmath0 .",
    "in general the contribution of the scalar field to the total energy density of the universe is insignificant at early times , nevertheless one has to fine - tune the initial value of @xmath17 in order to have its correct contribution at present .",
    "this is the fine tuning one needs to have in a thawing model . with these initial conditions",
    "we evolve the above system of equations from redshift @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) till the present day @xmath27",

    "tachyon - like scalar field having kinetic energy of born - infeld form has generated lot of interests in cosmology",
    ". there have been several investigations using this type of field as dark energy @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we form the similar set of equations for tachyon field as described above for ordinary scalar field .",

    "it shows that the equation of state of different fields with different potentials behave differently as one approaches the present day although in the past their behaviors are almost identical .",

    "this is necessary to have nearly flat potentials for the scalar fields at present day .",
    "due to this , the scale of fluctuations for these scalar fields are extremely large , making it a smoothly distributed field within the horizon scale .",

    "so we easily calculate the density contrast @xmath93 at the turn around epoch by integrating the equations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) and applying the boundary conditions @xmath101 and @xmath102 . the corresponding integral equation which governs the behavior of @xmath93 , for a flat cosmological model is given below : @xmath103^{1/2}{\\rm d}y = \\nonumber \\\\ \\int_{0}^{1 } \\left[x\\omega_{\\rm m}(x)\\right]^{1/2}{\\rm d}x\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of homogeneous dark energy , one can not follow this analytical procedure and has to solve the system of equations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) numerically with the boundary conditions @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    in figure 3 and 4",

    "the behaviors are similar with lesser deviation from @xmath0cdm for higher @xmath4 and vice versa .    ) for different tachyon field models for @xmath48 with the same potentials as in fig.5 .",
    "the lines correspond to the same as in fig.5.,width=302 ]      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in general the spherical collapse formalism leads to a point singularity as the final state of the system .",
    "but physically the objects go through a virialization process and stabilize to a finite size .",
    "such process of virialization is not built in the spherical collpase formalism but we have to put it by hand in order to ensure virialization .",
    "there are number of things that enter in this process of virialization as we describe below .",
    "first of all , the total energy has to be conserved always , hence the total energy at the time of turnaround should be equal to that at the time of virialization . at the turnaround the potential energy only contributes to the total energy of the system whereas the point of virialization",
    "is defined as where the virial theorem holds i.e the kinetic energy is related to the potential energy @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the kinetic and potential energy respectively . in our subsequent calculations we investigate two specific cases mentioned below :    * in the first case , we assume the dark energy is inhomogeneous and it virializes together with the matter .",
    "this assumption affects the way one calculates the turnaround point , as mentioned in equation ( 28 ) ( the case `` clustered d.e '' ) . on the other hand , the assumption that the dark energy takes part in the virialization process demands that the virial theorem should hold for the total kinetic and potential energy of the system ( i.e matter + dark energy ) .",
    "thus , applying the energy conservation together with this , we get@xcite + @xmath112 + @xmath113 + where @xmath114 is the kinetic energy and @xmath115 is the potential energy for matter , @xmath116 being the matter mass contained in the spherical over density .",
    "@xmath117 is the potential energy associated with the dark energy inside the spherical over density . here",
    "the subscripts `` f '' and `` t '' indicate the virialization and turn around time respectively and `` c '' for inside the cluster . using the above formulation",
    ", one can obtain a cubic equation which relates the ratio between the final ( virial ) @xmath118 and the turn - around radius @xmath119 , defined as the collapse factor @xmath120 : @xmath121where @xmath122 and @xmath123with @xmath124 being the matter density inside the sphere at the turn around time while @xmath125 is the background matter density at the same epoch .",
    "* in the second case , we assume that the dark energy is homogeneous and it does not virialize inside the cluster . in this case , to get the turnaround point , we use eqn(28 ) ( with the choice `` homogeneous de '' ) . on the other hand , as the dark energy does not virialze , its only effect is to contribute to the potential energy of the system . so applying the energy conservation , we get@xcite @xmath126_{f } = \\left[u_{gc}+u_{\\phi c}\\right]_{t}\\ ] ]    assuming that at the collapse point , the system has virialised fully , the density contrast at virialization as a function of @xmath106 and @xmath4 is given by @xmath127 where the relation between @xmath128 and @xmath129 can be estimated from the equation , @xmath130 together with the condition that the time needed to collapse is twice the turn - around time , @xmath131 , i.e. @xmath132 in case of a @xmath0 cosmology we get an analytical solution : @xmath133 where @xmath134",
    "the ratio between the scale factors converges to the einstein de sitter value @xmath135 at high redshifts .    in figure 5 and 6",
    ", we show the behavior of matter density contrast at virialization @xmath136 for different thawing models as a function of collapsed redshift @xmath106 .",
    "this parameter plays a crucial role as an observational tool which can be directly applied to press - schechter theory for comoving number density of virialized objects .",
    "the behavior is consistent with the fact that with @xmath106 , @xmath136 decreases and settles to the value @xmath137 for einstein de - sitter universe .",
    "once virialized , the density contrast inside the cluster is slightly higher in the homogeneous case compared to the inhomogeneous case .",
    "this is consistent with the result at the turnaround where also similar things happen .",
    "this means that in the homogeneous case , where only matter virializes , the density inside the clustered objects are higher .",
    "this is in agreement with the result obtained by maor @xcite for dark energy with constant equation of state .",
    "there are also few interesting results .",
    "the difference in @xmath136 for a particular thawing model with the corresponding @xmath0cdm model is larger for scalar and tachyon field with linear potential as well as for scalar field with pngb potential .",
    "also tachyon field with linear potential has the largest deviation from @xmath0cdm .",
    "this predicts that these models are easier to distinguish from @xmath0cdm model by observing abundances of bound objects . for scalar field model ,",
    "the diference between homogeneous and inhomogeneous model is highest for the potential @xmath138 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this potential also can act as a tracker or freezing model . for tachyon model ,",
    "these two cases are hardly distinguishable for all of the potentials .",
    "given the fact that the mass of the dark energy has to be extremely small , it is most likely that the field responsible for dark energy has to be homogeneous and should not cluster inside the virialized objects .",
    "if this is the scenario which is physically relevant , our results show that scalar as well as tachyon field dark energy models can be distinguished from the @xmath0cdm model by observing the abundances of bound objects since the virialized density contrast for homogeneous cases deviate sufficiently from the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we should mention , that the final results for @xmath136 , depend on both the background evolution as well as the fact that dark energy may cluster .",
    "the fact that the @xmath136 is slightly smaller for inhomogeneous case than the homogeneous one for all potentials , shows that the inhomogeneous dark energy acts against the matter clustering .",
    "but as the model is quite nonlinear and involves rigorous numerical computations , it is very difficult to predict the percentage of effects coming from the background evolution as well as from dark energy clustering which may be an useful information for actual n - body simulations .",
    "next , we give a fitting formula for @xmath136 as a function of collapsed redshift @xmath106 which is given by @xmath139    where @xmath140 . in table 1 , we show the values of the fitting parameters @xmath141 and @xmath142 for different models assuming @xmath48 .",
    "we also quote the the corresponding errors for these parameters at the @xmath143 confidence level .    in figure 7 , we show accuracy of our fitting function for thawing models with linear as well as pngb potential potential . for other potentials it also works equally",
    "well .        knowing that models with linear potential ( for both tachyon and ordinary scalar fields ) as well as models with pngb type potential deviate more from @xmath0cdm model in comparison to other potentials , we study the size of the collapsed objects for these potentials for homongeneous as well as for inhomogeneous cases . in figure 8",
    ", we show the evolution of the perturbation collapsing radii at the present time ( @xmath144 ) for these potentials .",
    "the radius has been normalized to the turnaround radius @xmath145 .",
    "it has been plotted with respect to the scale factor normalized to the turnaround scale factor for @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the collapse to singularity is avoided assuming that after the virialization , the size becomes constant . from the figure 8 , for homogeneous case",
    ", virialization occurs earlier than @xmath0cdm model whereas for inhomogeneous case , it happens later .",
    "this means , homogeneous models are more suitable for producing older bound objcets than @xmath0cdm .",
    "this gives a slight edge to homogeneous dark energy models over the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "although , in figure 8 , the virialized radii for different models are practically indistinguishable but still there are slight differences .",
    "first of all , the virialized radii for different scalar and tachyon models are smaller than the @xmath0cdm model , which in turn confirms that objects are more denser in these models than @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this is consistent with the results shown in figure 5 and 6 .",
    "secondly between individual models , virialised radius for tachyon model with linear potential is smaller than the other two models , e.g , scalar field with linear potential and scalar field with pngb potential .",
    "this is also consistent with behaviour of virialized density contrast shown in figure 7 .",
    "also the virialized radii in inhomogeous models are slightly larger than the homogneous counterpart , making the homogeneous one denser than inhomogeneous one .",
    "this is also consistent with what we show in figure 5 and 6 .",
    "in this work , we study the evolution of spherical overdensities for a general class of thawing dark energy models .",
    "we consider both ordinary scalar fields as well as tachyon fields having noncanonical kinetic energy .",
    "we consider variety of potentials for the fields . in studying the evolution of spherical over densities",
    ", we consider the dark energy to be homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous . for the homogeneous case ,",
    "we assume only matter virializes inside the cluster whereas for the inhomogeneous case , we assume both matter and dark energy virializes inside the cluster .    our main motivation is to see whether one can distinguish thawing dark energy models from @xmath0cdm model studying the evolution of spherical over density .",
    "our results show that although all the models become indistinguishable for objects collapsing earlier , for objects collapsing around present time , some of the thawing models deviate significantly from the @xmath0cdm model . to be specific , models with linear potential both for standard scalar fields and tachyon , together with scalar field with pngb type potential have significant deviation from @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we have shown that the size of the virialised object , the density contrast at turnaround as well as at virialization differ significantly for these models from @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained by sen et al .",
    "@xcite for thawing models considering the background evolution .",
    "also the deviations are enhanced in the homogeneous dark energy case where matter only virializes inside the cluster , thereby making it more probable to be distinguished from @xmath0cdm .",
    "given the fact that the mass of the dark energy field has to be extremely small , it is safe to assume that the dark energy remains homogeneous for most of the relevant scales .",
    "hence the evolution of spherical overdensities in large scale structure formation can be a useful tool to distinguigh model from @xmath0cdm .",
    "we have also derived the fitting formula for @xmath136 as function of collapsed redshift for different models and tabulated the values of the fitting parameters for different models assuming the dark energy to be homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous .",
    "although we have not shown explicitly , if one varies @xmath4 , deviations are higher for values smaller than @xmath48 and vice versa .",
    "this is because smaller the value of @xmath4 , higher the contribution from dark energy at late times and hence one needs more matter inside the cluster for objects collapsing at late times .",
    "an important conclusion one can draw from this study is that thawing models with linear potential can have significant deviation from @xmath0cdm model .",
    "now , scalar fields with linear potential have received little attention as a viable dark energy candidate @xcite .",
    "but it certainly deserves more attention , especially for the homogeneous case .",
    "finallly , we want to stress that we study a toy model for nonlinear evolution of over density where we use simplified assumption of spherical over - densities . in order to compare the theoretical results with observational data , one has to give away this simplified assumption and has to perform full n - body simulations to calculate accurately the dark energy signatures in nonlinear structure formation . but",
    "even with this simplified assumption , we find some interesting features in the nonlinear evolution of matter over - densities in the thawing class of dark energy models .",
    "this may be helpful for more detailed n - body simulations .",
