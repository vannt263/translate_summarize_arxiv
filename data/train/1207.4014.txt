    "the lpa with a sharp cut - off regulator must be supplemented with mean - field initial conditions at @xmath268 which restricts the solution of the equation to a small domain of the @xmath271 plane . moreover , even in this restricted domain , the critical parameters are in poor agreement with the mc data of ref .",
