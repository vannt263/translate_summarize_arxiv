    "sagittarius ( sgr ) a * is the compact radio , infrared and x - ray source associated with the @xmath6 supermassive black hole at the dynamical center of our galaxy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as the nearest galactic nucleus ,",
    "sgr a@xmath0offers unique access to accretion physics on event horizon scales , and is thus a key testbed for theoretical modeling . on the other hand in the almost 40 years since its radio identification @xcite",
    ", a multitude of observational campaigns in the radio / millimeter , near - infrared ( nir ) and x - ray bands have established that sgr a@xmath0is emitting steadily at a bolometric luminosity @xmath7 , orders of magnitude lower than is typical for nearby low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sgr a@xmath0is thus either representative of a distinct class of quiescent galactic nuclei lurking within most normal galaxies , or it is simply occupying the extreme low end of the agn continuum ( see , e.g. , @xcite , figure  4 ) . placing sgr a@xmath0into context with other objects is therefore an important goal , in order to correctly interpret its rather atypical features .",
    "the x - ray band is a powerful probe of the inner accretion flow regions of black holes .",
    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ soon after its launch was the first to identify sgr a@xmath0by discovering a dominant , steady emission state @xcite which can just be spatially resolved at _ chandra _ s subarcsecond imaging resolution . this emission can be associated with thermal bremsstrahlung from near the gravitational capture radius ( @xcite ; but see @xcite for an alternative ) .",
    "the x - ray `` quiescent state '' is punctuated roughly daily by flares with @xmath8 hour time scales that point to a source within @xmath9 s of @xmath10 ( the gravitational radius ) from the black hole @xcite .",
    "the flares , whose emission has been modeled with synchrotron or alternatively inverse compton , are most likely caused by nonthermal processes ( e.g. , shock or magnetic reconnection acceleration of electrons within a jet ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though other mechanisms have also been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simultaneous monitoring campaigns with the nir have established that all the x - ray flares have nir counterparts , while only the brighter nir flares ( @xmath11 mjy ) have corresponding x - ray activity @xcite .",
    "the relationship of x - ray and nir flaring to that in the sub - millimeter ( submm ) bands is still under debate , although broad peaks delayed from the nir have been noted @xcite .",
    "many important questions persist about the nature of the accretion flow in sgr a@xmath0 , and particularly about the flares , which seem to provide a missing link with activity seen in other weakly accreting black holes .",
    "specifically , in the last decade the fundamental plane ( fp ) of black hole accretion @xcite has emerged as an important concept that links black hole mass and radiative output in the radio and x - ray bands for weakly accreting systems , with sgr a@xmath0being an extreme low - luminosity example of such systems .",
    "as statistics have improved , it now appears that the x - ray flux of sgr a@xmath0approaches or meets the expectations from the fp only during its flaring state , but lies at too low an x - ray flux , relative to its radio emission , during quiescence @xcite .",
    "as the fp radio luminosity is associated with synchrotron emission from accelerated particles in compact jets , the flares may be providing clues about jet launching and plasma processes near the black hole .",
    "only about two dozen x - ray flares have been detected so far , primarily with _",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton_. most flare fluxes are on the order of a factor of a few to ten times the quiescent flux , but a few show fluxes on the order of 100 times greater than quiescence , and sometimes have associated pre- or post - cursor `` hiccups '' , i.e. , weak flares close in time to the major outburst @xcite .",
    "exact flare characteristics such as spectral slope , which is very important for constraining models , are not well - determined because _",
    "chandra_flares suffer pileup .",
    "pileup in the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer - imaging array ( acis - i ; @xcite ) is when two or more events arrive in overlapping pixel regions within the same detector readout frame , and subsequently are either read as a single event with the summed energy or are discarded as a non - x - ray event @xcite .",
    "although _ xmm - newton_flare observations do not suffer from pileup , its larger mirror point spread function ( psf ) does not isolate the accretion flow as effectively .",
    "prior studies had shown spectral slope differences between flares observed with _",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton_@xcite , and it has been unclear to what extent these differences were due to instrumental effects .    as part of an unprecedented x - ray visionary project ( xvp ) awarded in its cycle 13 guest observer program , _",
    "chandra_has begun the first of a total of 3msec of observations to be carried out in 2012 with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; @xcite ) . the main goal of this program is to constrain the accretion processes around sgr a@xmath0 , including detecting flares for the first time with high - resolution spectroscopy ( @xmath12@6.4kev ) . in our first several observations ,",
    "already two major flaring periods have occurred , the first of which contains the brightest flare detected to date . this flare is sufficiently strong and long to allow us to create an individual spectrum . here",
    "we present a detailed analysis of this flare and compare its spectra and characteristics to the two brightest x - ray flares reported in the last decade of sgr a@xmath0observations .",
    "in addition we discuss the quiescent state , as observed in the @xmath13order of the gratings , and suggest a standardized method for reporting flare peaks and spectra to aid in characterizing the flare distribution for studies of the entire sample of events .",

    "chandra_observations of sgr a@xmath0using its acis - i , totaling 1.2msec , and now 10 using the hetgin combination with the acis - spectroscopy array ( acis - s ) , totaling 320ks . the hetgis comprised of two gratings sets : the medium energy gratings ( meg ) and the high energy gratings ( heg ) , which disperse spectra into positive and negative spectral orders .",
    "we consider only the hegand meg@xmath14@xmath15orders , which between them cover the @xmath169kev energy band .",
    "additionally , an on - axis undispersed image is created at ccd spectral resolution ( the @xmath13order ) . compared to observations without insertion of the hetg , the @xmath13order efficiency ranges from @xmath17 at 2kev to @xmath18 at 8kev , with an average of @xmath19 when weighted by sgr a@xmath0 s quiescent count rate spectrum .",
    "the focus of our present work is a very bright flare observed with the hetgsduring a 59.25ks observation that began at 06:17:03 utc on 2012 february 9 ( obsid 14392 ) .",

    "we took two steps to isolate sgr a@xmath0 s flare emission and minimize the contribution from diffuse x - ray background .",

    "for the major flare discussed in this paper , we also extracted lightcurves and spectra for the @xmath14@xmath15order gratings ( as determined by the ` tg_resolve_events ` tool ) from long , 5 pixel wide rectangular regions centered on the dispersed spectra .",

    "we chose a detection significance level of 98.2% , i.e. , @xmath22 , for each lightcurve `` change point '' .",
    "since a flare has at least two change points , a rise and a decay , the overall flare significance is at least 99.97% .",

    "we will describe the statistics and properties of the full set of flares detected in all _ chandra_observations ; however , here we are concerned with the second flare from obsid 14392 .",

    "a large flare occurs roughly halfway through the observation and lasts @xmath24ks , with two possible precursor flares at @xmath25s and @xmath26s .",
    "the latter flare appears in the bayesian blocks lightcurve only if we decrease the detection significance level ( for detecting two change points ) to 93% . as discussed in section  [ sec : spectra ] , we create spectra for the mean of the large flare , but do not have sufficient statistics to describe the spectra at the flare peak . determining the amplitude of the flare in the lightcurve is therefore particularly important for assessing the flare s peak luminosity .",
    "the precursor flares are rather faint ; however , the main flare is clearly visible above the background level , which is composed of the quiescent emission from sgr a@xmath0as well as diffuse emission throughout the extraction regions .",
    "the main flare is asymmetric ( figure  [ fig : flare ] , bottom ) , with a slow rise and a sharp decline , and can be modeled as a strong , wide ( @xmath27s ) gaussian flare followed by a weaker , narrower ( @xmath28s ) gaussian flare approximately 1100 s later .",

    "figure  [ fig : bb ] shows this rate ratio for the lightcurve sub - intervals obtained from the bayesian blocks decomposition . because the @xmath13order is still subject to pileup , this ratio can vary even in the absence of color evolution . for a constant spectral shape",

    "the expected curve is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : bb ] , under the assumption that all piled events are recorded ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) and that the gratings rate is @xmath5437% of the total incident unpiled count rate . the data are consistent with no detectable spectral evolution during the flare , aside from pileup effects .",
    "we estimate that due to the effects of pileup , our lightcurve measurement of the peak / mean ratio is a factor @xmath55 too low .",
    "these naive estimates , however , are subject to systematic uncertainties in the details of the pileup model . for the @xmath13order spectra , we estimate that on average , 8% of the _ incident _ flare photons are subject to pileup , with this fraction increasing to 16% at the flare peak .",
    "of the _ detected _ @xmath13order flare events , on average 04% ( for @xmath561 ) are in fact `` piled '' events falsely registered at higher energies that harden the spectrum .",
    "this systematic effect is accounted for in the @xmath13order spectral fits below , aided by the fact that the simultaneously fit hetgsspectra are not subject to pileup .",
    "nevertheless , uncertainty in pileup modeling ( specifically , @xmath57 ) serves to widen the error bars on the photon index fit to the flare spectra .",
    "we next consider the spectrum for the bright flare observed in obsid 14392 , and specifically compare it to sgr a@xmath0quiescent spectra .",
    "it is not completely straightforward to characterize sgr a@xmath0 s quiescent emission , as it is clearly extended @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent models of the extended emission ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that only on the order of 1% of the observed quiescent emission arises near the event horizon , as opposed to flare models where , owing to time scales of only thousands of seconds , almost all the emission is associated with the inner region .",
    "we ignore these distinctions and do not break up the quiescent emission into `` point - like '' and `` extended '' components , nor do we even attempt to `` background subtract '' the quiescent emission .",
    "instead , we use consistent extraction regions between the quiescent and flare periods , and treat the flare as _ additional _ emission . since our quiescent spectra include diffuse emission , we generally prefer to report absolute flare flux levels , rather than describing the flare in terms of a `` factor times quiescent emission . ''",
    "the mean absorbed flux density in the 28 kev band is the quantity least subject to systematic uncertainty and most useful in comparing current and prior observations .",
    "to accomplish these measurements , we created a @xmath13order spectrum and @xmath14@xmath15order spectra for the 5600s interval of the brightest flare in obsid 14392 . in order to isolate the actual flare spectrum ,",
    "it is important to have a reliable characterization of the quiescent spectrum . for the gratings",
    ", we created a background spectrum by extracting a @xmath15order spectrum from the quiescent periods of obsid 14392 . because the @xmath13order spectral analysis of the flare is complicated by the presence of pileup , we modeled the @xmath13order flare spectrum as the sum of a flare component and a quiescent component .",
    "to constrain the quiescent component , we created quiescent spectra from _ all _ _ chandra_observations of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "we kept the acis - iand @xmath13order acis - sspectra separate , but fit them with a single model .",
    "this method appears justified because our k - s test does not indicate a difference between the pre- and post - flare quiescent spectra , and because prior studies have suggested a fairly stable quiescent level @xcite .",
    "we restricted our fits of the quiescent acis - ispectra to the 0.59 kev band , the @xmath13order quiescent spectra to the 19 kev band , and the gratings spectra to the 29 kev band .",
    "all combined spectra were rebinned to have a minimum signal - to - noise of 4.5 in each energy bin , and the gratings spectra were further required to have a minimum of 16 pre - binning channels per final energy bin .",
    "only those bins completely inside the above energy ranges were included in our analysis .",
    "for clarity , we set out the details of our fitting process .",
    "the quiescent spectra from acis - iand the @xmath13order were fit jointly with a single model consisting of an absorbed , dust - scattered power - law and an iron emission line ( see below for details ) .",
    "the @xmath15order grating spectrum of the flare was modeled as a second absorbed , dust - scattered power - law , and the @xmath13order spectrum of the flare was treated as the sum of these two components convolved through the isis pileup model .",

    "the flare spectrum is significantly harder ; however , for most values of x - ray absorbing column the flare photon index is somewhat softer than implied by previous _",
    "chandra_measurements of a bright flare that indicated @xmath77 ( 90% confidence level ; @xcite ) . absent the use of the hetgs , however , there is a question as to what extent this prior result was influenced by pileup .",
    "this prior result also used an earlier version of the _ chandra_calibration and did not include the @xmath61 dependence of dust scattering losses to the spectrum .",
    "our best - fit mean flare photon index of @xmath78 is in good agreement with previous results obtained for the brightest ( 2002 october 3 ) and second brightest ( 2007 april 4 ) sgr a@xmath0flares ever observed by _ xmm - newton_@xcite , from 22 observations centered on sgr a@xmath0which totaled 1.1msec through 2009 april . in order to carefully assess the degree",
    "to which the properties of the hetgsobserved flare are comparable to the brightest _ xmm - newton_observed flares , we have re - fit the 210kev spectra of the 2002 october 3 and 2007 april 4 flares  using the same data files as @xcite  with the identical absorbed / scattered power - law modelflare with a dust scattering model that presumed a fixed @xmath79 ( i.e. , the scattering optical depth was not tied to the fitted @xmath59 ) and used the ` tbabs ` absorption model and abundances of @xcite with the cross sections of @xcite .",

    "we find a photon index @xmath81 , equivalent neutral column of @xmath82 , and an unabsorbed 210kev flux of @xmath83 .",
    "this flare s mean absorbed 28kev flux is @xmath84 , which for its 2.8ks duration corresponds to an absorbed 28kev fluence of @xmath85 and an intrinsic emitted energy in the 210kev band of @xmath86erg .",
    "the photon indices found here are very similar to those reported in @xcite with a @xmath87 of only + 0.1 .",
    "the n@xmath88 values differ due to the different abundances and cross - sections assumed in this work .",
    "we find a photon index of @xmath89 for the 2007 april 4 flare , an equivalent neutral column of @xmath90 , and an unabsorbed 210kev flux of @xmath91 .",
    "the mean absorbed 28kev flux is @xmath92 , which for the flare s 2.9ks duration corresponds to an absorbed 28kev fluence of @xmath93 and an intrinsic emitted energy in the 210kev band of @xmath94erg .",
    "figure  [ fig : conf ] also presents confidence contours of x - ray absorbing column vs. 210kev unabsorbed flux and photon index , @xmath58 , for these two _ xmm - newton_observed flares .",
    "we see that the 2002 october and 2012 february events appear to be `` twin flares '' in all respects , and that aside from having a lower flux , the 2007 april flare otherwise appears identical to these two extremely bright flares .",
    "the _ xmm - newton_observed flares have slightly larger best - fit values for the equivalent neutral column ; however , there is a high - degree of overlap among the error contours . both _",
    "xmm - newton_observed flares are also slightly shorter in duration , lasting @xmath95ks , with the brightest flare lightcurve also showing a brief dip near its peak , detected in all three epicinstruments @xcite .",
    "our _ chandra_-hetgsobservation of sgr a@xmath0taken on 2012 february 9 ( obsid 14392 ) exhibits a flare with the highest peak flux and fluence seen from this source .",
    "remarkably , it is bright enough to allow the extraction of a pure flare gratings spectrum .",
    "our comparative analysis indicates that in many ways , the bright sgr a@xmath0flares observed by _ xmm - newton_in 2002 october and 2007 april are spectral twins to this flare .",
    "depending upon how one defines and measures sgr a@xmath0 s quiescent flux and in how one extrapolates the mean flare flux to a peak flux , for both the 2012 february and 2002 october flares , the ratio of peak flux to quiescent flux is at least a factor of order 130 .",
    "if one adopts the suggestion of @xcite that only @xmath96 of the observed quiescent flux is from the central regions ( where the flare likely originates ) , then this factor is more plausibly of order @xmath97 !    given systematic uncertainties in extrapolating unabsorbed fluxes and defining the quiescent flux associated solely with the sgr a@xmath0point source , however , we suggest that a less ambiguous set of reported values are the flare s mean absorbed 28kev flux , its absorbed 28kev fluence , and the ratio of its peak rate to mean rate , each measured as values _ above _ the quiescent level and aperture corrected for the instrument s psf .",
    "so long as instrumental spectral extraction regions are consistent for quiescent and flare spectra , these values will be well - defined .",
    "( however , due to the short time scale sub - structure in the flare , as seen in figure  [ fig : bb ] and previously reported by @xcite , the `` peak '' flux value may actually be difficult to define precisely . )",
    "the 28kev band is above the range of the most severe x - ray absorption in sgr a@xmath0and is well - covered by the three soft x - ray instruments best capable of observing sgr a@xmath0 : _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _",
    "swift_.    the bright flare is asymmetric , with a slower rise than decay .",
    "this may be due to unresolved sub - structure : the bayesian blocks decomposition shows evidence of complex structure near the flare peak , and a fit with two gaussian profiles , with different widths and offset from one another , works well .",
    "( the fitted gumbell profile is a convenience that allows us to easily calculate the flare peak / mean ratio . ) alternatively , if this is the flare s intrinsic profile it is quite different than the `` fast rise , exponential decay '' of many different types of transient phenomena .",
    "the total emitted 210kev energy of the flare , which is of @xmath98erg@xmath99 , requires conversion of at least @xmath100 g of rest mass into energy , presuming a 10% conversion efficiency .",
    "there is no agreed upon mechanism for flare energization , with suggestions having ranged from magnetic reconnection @xcite to tidal disruption of asteroids @xcite .",
    "regardless of the energization mechanism , with the results from the prior _ xmm - newton_observations it appears that at least these extremely bright flares require an emission mechanism that produces a moderate ( i.e. , not very hard ) photon index , @xmath101 .",
    "as we have shown , much of the uncertainty on the spectral slope is systematic , and depends on assumptions made about absorption and scattering .",
    "reasonable assumptions about the scaling between dust scattering and absorption have only a small systematic effect ( @xmath102 ) , but the dependence upon fitted @xmath59 is more pronounced ( i.e. , figure  [ fig : conf ] ) .",
    "although there is a good consistency between the equivalent neutral column for the quiescent and flare spectra , it is possible to alter the fitted @xmath59 by assuming different metal abundances , or metal depletions in dust grains , or different cross sections , etc .",
    "based on the correlation from @xcite and our assumptions about @xmath103 and @xmath104 outlined in section  [ sec : spectra ] , the minimum reasonable x - ray absorbing column for the quiescent spectrum implies an extinction of @xmath105 .",
    "this is somewhat at odds with prior estimates of @xmath106 : a discussion of the galactic center optical and infrared extinction curves can be found in @xcite , who suggest a value of @xmath107 ( in part based upon the x - ray observations of sgr a@xmath0discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the relationships derived by @xcite and @xcite , @xmath108 , imply a similar value for the extinction towards sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "however , the methods used to derive @xmath109 and @xmath104 in these works are very heterogeneous , and it is unclear if their scalings can be extrapolated to @xmath110 .",
    "it is therefore imperative that scaling between @xmath111 extinction , and dust scattering optical depth be revisited with modern models using consistent cross sections and abundances , and with modern high spectral and imaging resolution observations . for the moment , we conclude that the extinction , dust scattering optical depth , @xmath109 , and ( by extension ) the spectral properties of sgr a@xmath0are still subject to a certain degree of systematic uncertainty .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "we find similar spectral properties for the brightest _",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton_flares ( @xmath1122 and @xmath4 @xmath5 ) . weaker flares could in principle have harder spectra than bright flares , but their spectral properties are not yet yet strongly constrained ( as shown and discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is significant cause for optimism , as the observations discussed in this work represent slightly more than 10% of the _ chandra_-hetgsobservations of sgr a@xmath0that will occur in 2012 .",
