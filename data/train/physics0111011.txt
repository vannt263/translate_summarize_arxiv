    "the investigation of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is a long studied subject of plasma physics ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the traditional approach one studies low amplitude waves propagating in an uncorrelated plasma .",
    "important information on the properties of plasmas in the linear response regime can be obtained from the knowledge of the dielectric tensor .",
    "the dielectric function of a magnetized uncorrelated plasma has been extensively studied by horing @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of low amplitude waves or the interaction of low intensity particle beams with plasmas may be studied by employing the dielectric function .",
    "recently , the stopping power of an uncorrelated plasma has been investigated @xcite .",
    "there have been two basic lines beyond the traditional investigations of electromagnetic modes propagation .",
    "one line considers the influence of correlation effects on the plasma dispersion relations .",
    "recent papers are devoted to the study of the dielectric tensor of correlated magnetized plasmas and to the investigation of the electromagnetic mode dispersion in coupled magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "the other line is aimed at the investigation of nonlinear effects in uncorrelated plasmas .",
    "a growing number of papers is dedicated to the study of the propagation of intense radiation in plasmas ( recent works are cited in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the important area in these investigations is the generation of magnetic fields under the influence of electromagnetic ( em ) waves @xcite .",
    "one of the sources of the generation of induced magnetization is the inverse faraday effect ( ife ) .",
    "the induced magnetization from ife due to propagation of several waves in plasma , has been previously investigated ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this phenomenon arises from magnetic moment per unit volume of the ordered motion of charges of both signs , in the presence of an electromagnetic wave propagating in plasma @xcite .",
    "this induced field must have axial as well as lateral component depending on the nature of the wave - wave and wave- particle interactions .",
    "for an elliptically polarized alfven wave propagating along the static back ground magnetic field in a two component plasma , this induced magnetization were found to be inversely proportional to the cube of the ambient magnetic field and the square of the incident wave amplitude , and acts in the direction of the incident wave propagation .",
    "such effects are expected to be significant in the study of various processes in the sun and other stars , including pulsars .",
    "this effect may be demonstrated in laboratory plasmas .    in this paper , it has been shown that the zero harmonic magnetic moment generated from an elliptically polarized em - wave along the direction of its propagation induces strong dc magnetic permeability depending non - linearly on the incident wave amplitude and acts in the same direction as the induced magnetization .",
    "moreover , a small perturbation of the self - generated zero harmonic magnetic moment starts to evolve .",
    "this evolution can be investigated by using block equation model @xcite.in this paper this evolution has been studied and it has been shown that it induces strong magnetic anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the incident wave propagation .",
    "this induced magnetic anisotropy is evident from the existence of non - vanishing off - diagonal elements of the magnetic permeability tensor , which also depend non - linearly on the incident wave amplitude",
    ".    in general plasma medium is not a magnetic material .",
    "however , the propagation of an incident em wave in a plasma generates a self generated uniform magnetization @xmath0 which induces a strong magnetic permeability in the plasma medium depending nonlinearly on the incident wave amplitude . as magnetic permeability of a ferromagnet is very large , we can assume our resulting plasma medium as a weakly ferromagnetic medium in which magnetic permeability is large but not as large as for a ferromagnetic material medium .",
    "the self generated uniform magnetization may be considered as the ground state magnetization . since we have considered long wave length excitations ,",
    "a continuum theory is appropriate to study the evolution of small perturbation in the ground state magnetization .",
    "thus a weak ferromagnetic behavior of plasma is expected which can change the orientation of the bulk magnetization of the plasma that can reduce the mobility of electrons and ions and as a result the displacement current dominates over the conduction current @xcite .",
    "this effect modifies the dispersion characteristics of the incident em - wave .",
    "the dispersion relation of the incident em - wave in the resulting plasma medium has been obtained in this paper . in the low frequency alfven wave limit",
    ", it has been seen that the phase velocity of the incident alfven wave in the resulting plasma medium depends on the static back - ground magnetic field of the plasma as well as on the square of the incident wave amplitude .",
    "as the induced magnetization is directly proportional to the square of the incident wave amplitude , the increase in the wave amplitude causes to increase the induced ife magnetization .",
    "this pronounces the induced magnetic anisotropy , and ultimately inhibits the alfven wave propagation in the resulting plasma medium .",
    "these results have been verified numerically both in the solar corona and sunspots .    on the basis of this mechanism",
    "many authors have already developed a new mechanism of stabilization of stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) in laser produced plasmas , which is a consequence of the self - generated magnetic field in the sbs process @xcite . in that case ,",
    "a temporally exponentially growing zero harmonic magnetic field was generated in both axial and lateral directions .",
    "the lateral magnetic field was found to be responsible for the initiation of magnetic anisotropy in the plasma medium , which can exponentially reduce the phase velocities of incident and scattered light waves .",
    "however , for an elliptically polarized em - wave propagating parallel to the static back- ground magnetic field , a zero harmonic induced axial magnetization is only generated .",
    "this axial magnetization in the ground state can not induce magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the evolution of its linear perturbation induces magnetic anisotropy in the plasma medium , which has been investigated in this paper by using block equation model .    in section 2",
    ", the dc magnetic permeability induced by the self - generated axial magnetic moment has been obtained .",
    "its evolution has been studied in section 3 .",
    "the effect of this evolution on the incident em - wave is investigated in section 4 .",
    "section 5 describes these results in the low frequency alfven wave limit .",
    "calculation of the magnetic moment induced by the alfven wave is given in the appendix .",
    "numerical estimation has been followed by discussion cited in section 6 .",
    "in the classical approximation , the bulk magnetization present in a magnetic material should be due to orbital angular momentum of charges , because of the distortion of orbital motion under the inference of em fields @xcite .",
    "when an em wave propagates along the static background magnetic field , in a two component plasma , the magnetic moment is generated from the inverse faraday effect ( ife ) mechanism along the @xmath1-direction , @xmath2 which has been presented in the appendix .",
    "this magnetic moment can be expressed in the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 with @xmath7 @xmath8 are charge , mass and cyclotronfrequencies of electrons and ions , respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the amplitudes of the incident elliptically polarized em wave , @xmath11 is the static background magnetic field .",
    "the unperturbed plasma density is given by @xmath12 and c is the velocity of light in vacuum , @xmath13 is the frequency of the incident em wave , @xmath14 is the direction of incident wave propagation .    hence the induced magnetization is ,    @xmath15    which also acts along the direction of wave propagation . substituting eqs.([2.1],[2.2],[2.3 ] ) in the constitutive relation @xmath16 with @xmath17 we obtain @xmath18 and hence @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the dimensionless amplitude of the incident em wave , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the plasma frequency of s - th species of charges .",
    "this shows that the zero harmonic magnetic moment @xmath23 induces a strong dc magnetic permeability @xmath24 depending nonlinearly on the incident wave amplitude and in the @xmath1-direction . thus the resulting plasma medium behaves as a ferromagnetic medium with the ife magnetization as the ground state magnetization . in the next section",
    ", the dynamics of this self - generated axial ife magnetization will be studied .",
    "from a macroscopic point of view , we may consider the ferromagnetic media as continua characterized by a magnetic moment density called magnetization .",
    "the ground state of a ferromagnet is of uniform magnetization at absolute zero temperature .",
    "a small disturbance in this magnetization will propagate in such a medium and this propagation can be studied by block equation model @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the bulk magnetization and @xmath27 is the effective magnetic field in the medium , @xmath28 is the charge to mass ratio and @xmath29 is the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "the propagation of an elliptically polarized em wave in a two component magnetized plasma induces a zero harmonic axial magnetic moment from ife , which generates a nonlinear magnetic permeability in the same direction .",
    "the plasma behaves as a weakly ferromagnetic medium and the induced magnetic moment @xmath30 acts as its bulk magnetization .",
    "this bulk magnetization is immediately perturbed and the resulting magnetization follows the equation @xmath31 where s = e(electron)/i(ion ) and the effective magnetic field @xmath27 is the sum of the background magnetic field @xmath32 and the @xmath33 harmonic magnetic field @xmath34 of the incident em wave .",
    "thus , we have @xmath35 moreover , the resulting magnetization , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the linearized perturbation of the bulk magnetization @xmath38 . both @xmath37 and @xmath34",
    "satisfy the condition @xmath39 @xmath38 being the zero harmonic magnetic moment from the orbital motion of sth species of charges given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is independent of both space and time . here",
    ", @xmath42 are the first order perturbations in @xmath43 and @xmath27 , respectively . using eqs.([3.3],[3.4 ] ) in ( [ 3.2 ] ) and linearizing we obtain @xmath44 substitution of ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.8 ] ) in the rhs of ( [ 3.9 ] ) gives @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the magnetization frequency of the sth species of charge particles , which depends on the induced magnetization @xmath48 .",
    "it is actually the frequency of gyration of charge particles about the lines of forces of the induced magnetic field @xmath38 . substituting @xmath48 from ( [ 3.7 ] ) in @xmath49",
    ", we obtain @xmath50 from ( [ 3.10 ] ) and ( [ 3.11 ] ) we obtain the coupled differential equations , @xmath51 @xmath52 since @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the @xmath55 and @xmath56 components of the magnetic field @xmath57 of the incident em wave , propagating along the z - direction , and hence @xmath58 , @xmath59 are all proportional to @xmath60 $ ] . hence ( [ 3.13 ] ) and ( [ 3.14 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath61 @xmath62 or equivalently , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the magnetic susceptibility tensor , whose non vanishing component are @xmath65 hence the net induced magnetic susceptibility of the resulting plasma medium is @xmath66 consequently the induced magnetic permeability of the medium becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the unit matrix of order 3 .",
    "substitution of ( [ 3.20 ] ) in ( [ 3.22 ] ) gives @xmath69 @xmath70 and hence @xmath71 @xmath72 it is seen from the expression ( [ 3.25 ] ) and ( [ 3.26 ] ) that @xmath73 and @xmath74 depend on the square of the incident wave amplitude .",
    "the nonvanishing off - diagonal elements @xmath74 and @xmath75 indicate that a strong magnetic anisotropy is developed in the @xmath76-plane , perpendicular to the direction of incident wave propagation ( along the z - direction ) .",
    "this anisotropy is exclusively due to the evolution of the perturbation @xmath77 in a plasma medium , having weakly ferromagnetic properties .",
    "as we are studying magnetic moment dynamics in the plasma medium under the action of long range coulomb forces between the charge particles , classical theory is more appropriate than quantum mechanical theory because any disturbance propagates through a plasma medium with a wave length much greater than the atomic distances .    in this section",
    "we shall investigate how this induced magnetic anisotropy changes the dispersion characteristics of the incident elliptically polarized em wave .",
    "the induced magnetic anisotropy reduces the mobility of the charge particles .",
    "hence the conduction current becomes negligible and the displacement current dominates over conduction current .",
    "thus in such an insulated ferromagnet , the propagation of an em wave obeys the following maxwell equations @xmath78 @xmath79 with constitutive relations @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 are respectively the dielectric tensor and magnetic permeability tensor of the resulting plasma medium , @xmath83 has been already obtained in section 3 .",
    "since the plasma under consideration is initially magnetized , it has a dielectric anisotropy of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 since the electric field @xmath86 , @xmath87 and magnetic field @xmath53 , @xmath54 of the incident electromagnetic wave contain the phase factor @xmath60 $ ] , where @xmath13 and @xmath88 are its frequency and wave number , the maxwell equations ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ 4.2 ] ) together with the state relations ( [ 4.4 ] ) reduce to @xmath89 @xmath90 substituting @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 from ( [ a.15 ] ) and([a.16 ] ) , we obtain @xmath91 which is the modified dispersion relation of the incident em wave in the anisotropic plasma medium .",
    "substitution of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 from ( [ 3.25],[3.26 ] ) and ( [ 4.7 ] ) in ( [ 4.10 ] ) gives @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the refractive index of the resulting plasma medium .",
    "this dispersion relation shows that the dispersion characteristics of the incident em wave depend on the product of the incident em wave amplitude . in the next section",
    "we shall investigate such characteristics for the case of alfven waves .",
    "if the incident em wave propagating in a two component plasma along the static background magnetic field is an alfven wave , the wave frequency satisfies the condition @xmath96    under the approximation ( [ 5.1 ] ) the dispersion relation ( [ 4.11 ] ) reduces to @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the alfven velocity in the plasma .",
    "thus we get two branches of mode propagation . in the case of a low amplitude wave , @xmath99",
    ", we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ 5.3 ] ) the dispersion relation of the ordinary alfven wave with only one branch .",
    "consider the modifications of wave propagation caused by the nonlinearity .",
    "first , the nonlinearity produces a splitting of the alfven branch into two branches corresponding to the left elliptically polarized ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 of equal sign ) or to the right elliptically polarized alfven wave ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 of different sign ) , respectively .",
    "second , the phase velocity of the incident alfven wave in the resulting anisotropic plasma medium becomes @xmath100 this shows that alfven wave can propagate with very large but finite phase velocity ( [ 5.4 ] ) , if @xmath101 only very long wave length alfven waves can propagate , if @xmath102 the first brunch of the nonlinear alfven wave has a cutoff , if @xmath103 the second brunch has ist cutoff , if @xmath104 we see that for a given amplitude of the alfven wave the magnetic field strength @xmath11 should exceed a certain threshold @xmath105 to make propagation of the alfven wave possible .",
    "in the solar corona , the ambient magnetic field is , @xmath106 and the plasma mass density is , @xmath107 .",
    "hence the alfven speed in a solar corona is @xmath108 . if an alfven wave of amplitude @xmath109 propagates in the solar corona , the induced magnetic field would be of the order of @xmath110 and the phase velocity of the incident wave in the resulting anisotropic plasma medium is very large but finite .",
    "this implies that only very long wave length waves can propagate in such a medium . for an incident wave amplitude @xmath111 ,",
    "the induced magnetization is @xmath112 and the wave phase velocity @xmath113 becomes infinite .",
    "moreover , if the incident wave amplitude increases to a value @xmath114 , the induced magnetization becomes @xmath115 and the phase velocity of the incident wave becomes imaginary and no further wave propagation is possible .",
    "the refractive index of nonlinear circular polarized alfven wave with amplitude @xmath116 and propagating in the solar corona is shown in fig .",
    "[ alfven ] . with increasing wave amplitude the refractive indices of both nonlinear alfven brunches decrease .",
    "the first brunch ( @xmath117 ) has its cutoff at an amplitude @xmath118 , whereas the second brunch ranges up to an amplitude of @xmath119 .",
    "similar results have also been obtained in sunspots , where @xmath120 , mass density @xmath121 and alfven speed @xmath122 . in that case for @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath113 is very large but finite . for @xmath125 , @xmath126 becomes @xmath127 and @xmath113 is infinite , and for @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath113 is imaginary .",
    "these numerical results confirm that the increase in the incident wave amplitude produces a magnetic anisotropy via the increasing induced magnetization in the plasma medium and consequently inhibits the alfven wave propagation .",
    "from the results so far obtained in this paper , it is evident that for a strong em wave propagating along the static back ground magnetic field in a two component plasma , the self generated zero harmonic axial magnetic moment starts to evolve .",
    "this evolution induces a strong magnetic anisotropy in the plasma medium and the medium consequently behaves as a weakly ferromagnetic medium with the zero harmonic magnetization as the ground state magnetization .",
    "this anisotropy inhibits the incident wave propagation in the resulting plasma medium .",
    "moreover , as the wave amplitude increases , the anisotropy becomes strong and absorption of the wave by the medium is pronounced .",
    "we consider the propagation of a transverse em - wave in a two component cold magnetized plasma in which electrons and ions are both mobile .",
    "collisions have been neglected .",
    "the basic equations describing such a plasma model , in the cold plasma limit are @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the charge and current densities in the plasma . assuming the plasma is initially quasi - static and quasi - neutral , such that @xmath138 we linearize the field variables , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the ambient magnetic field acting along the @xmath1-direction and @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath34 are the first order perturbations in the field variables about their equilibrium value .",
    "linearizing the basic equations ( [ a.1],[a.2],[a.3],[a.4],[a.5],[a.6 ] ) with the help of ( [ a.8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149",
