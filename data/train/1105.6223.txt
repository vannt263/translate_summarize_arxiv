    "stability of two - dimensional ( 2d ) plasma crystals is a fundamental problem of complex ( dusty ) plasmas .",
    "such crystals  which are monolayers of hexagonally ordered monodisperse microparticles  can be ( routinely ) created in a rf plasma @xcite : particles get negatively charged in a plasma and therefore the electric force exerted on them in the sheath above a horizontal electrode can compensate for gravity , thus providing a stable levitation .",
    "there are several mechanisms operating in complex plasmas that can result in the melting of 2d crystals .",
    "these mechanisms can generally be divided into two categories  _ generic _ and _ plasma - specific_.    generic mechanisms of melting are those operating in any ( classical ) system with a given pair interaction between particles , provided the interaction can be described by a hamiltonian .",
    "the melting in 2d systems can either be a two - step process ( which involves consecutive unbinding of weakly interacting dislocation and disclination pairs , respectively , with the intermediate hexatic phase ) @xcite or a one - step process ( where the hexatic phase is preempted by the formation of dislocation chains ) @xcite .",
    "these generic melting mechanisms can operate in very different 2d systems including complex plasmas @xcite .",
    "plasma - specific melting mechanisms can only operate in complex plasmas .",
    "such mechanisms are associated with the energy exchange between microparticles and ambient plasma and can be considered as a result of the system openness .",
    "for instance , 2d plasma crystals can be strongly perturbed by single particles moving above or below the monolayer @xcite , or they can melt due to fluctuations of particle charges @xcite .",
    "the most universal among the plasma - specific mechanisms is that associated with the _ wake - mediated _ interaction between microparticles : in the presence of strong plasma flow the screening cloud around each charged particle becomes highly asymmetric @xcite .",
    "these clouds are usually referred to as `` plasma wakes '' @xcite and play the role of a `` third body '' in the interparticle interaction , making it nonreciprocal @xcite . under certain conditions ,",
    "this makes the system non - hamiltonian and provides effective conversion of the energy of flowing ions into the kinetic energy of microparticles @xcite .",
    "the wake - induced mechanism of melting of crystalline monolayers was discovered theoretically a decade ago by ivlev and morfill @xcite .",
    "based on a simple model of a particle chain , it was shown that the longitudinal in - plane and transverse out - of - plane dust - lattice ( dl ) wave modes are no longer independent  they are coupled due to the wake - mediated interactions .",
    "when the modes intersect they become modified by the coupling and form a _ hybrid _ mode in a narrow vicinity of the crossing .",
    "this can trigger the _ mode - coupling instability _ which causes the melting .",
    "this melting mechanism had received strong confirmation later on , when the instability threshold predicted by the theory was compared @xcite with the experimental observations by u. konopka and numerical simulations by g. joyce .",
    "however , the direct comparison of theory and experiment became possible only recently , after an experimental method of measuring the out - of - plane mode was developed @xcite and therefore the essential fingerprint of the mode - coupling instability  the hybrid mode",
    " became observable . in recent",
    "experiment by coudel _",
    "_ @xcite an implementation of this method unambiguously demonstrated that the melting indeed occurs due to the resonance coupling between the longitudinal in - plane and transverse out - of - plane modes .",
    "the variation of the wave modes with the experimental conditions , including the emergence of the hybrid branch , revealed exceptionally good agreement with the theory of mode - coupling instability generalized for 2d case by zhdanov _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the theory of mode - coupling instability @xcite predicts a number of distinct fingerprints to be observed upon the instability onset : along with the emergence of hybrid mode mentioned above , these are a critical angular dependence ",
    "the hybrid mode first appears only for wave vectors oriented along one of the principal lattice axes , a mixed polarization  the two dl modes that form the hybrid mode are no longer purely longitudinal and transverse close to the merging point , and distinct thresholds  the instability sets in only when ( i ) the particle number density in the monolayer is high enough or / and vertical confinement eigenfrequency is low enough ( so that the two dl modes can cross and form the hybrid mode ) and ( ii ) the gas pressure is low enough ( so that the growth rate of the hybrid mode exceeds the damping rate ) .",
    "all these fingerprints have been mentioned in our previous theoretical publications @xcite , some of them were also illustrated in the followup experimental paper @xcite .",
    "however , their discussion was apparently too concise to address all these important properties in necessary detail .",
    "the need for in - depth discussion of the wake - mediated mode coupling became evident now , when new publications have appeared where some essential properties of the instability were misinterpreted ( see , e.g. , recent experimental paper @xcite and the subsequent erratum @xcite by liu _",
    "et al . _ ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper we summarize the key features of the mode coupling and provide a detailed discussion , analyze the critical dependence on experimental parameters , and highlight the outstanding issues .",
    "in 2d plasma crystals , two in - plane wave modes can be sustained ( here we naturally leave aside polydisperse mixtures ) .",
    "both modes have an acoustic dispersion , one of them is longitudinal and the other is transverse . since the strength of the vertical confinement in such systems is finite , there is a third fundamental wave mode which has an optical dispersion and is associated with the out - of - plane oscillations @xcite .",
    "theory predicts that all three modes depend critically on the parameters of the plasma wakes . yet",
    "the role of the wakes is not only the modification of the modes themselves .",
    "what is far more important is that the modes are _ coupled _ to each other due to the wake - mediated interactions between particles .",
    "it is worth noting that this _ coupling is linear _ and therefore does not depend on the wave amplitude .",
    "below we identify the conditions when the wake - mediated coupling becomes crucial for waves in 2d crystals .      in general , linear dispersion relations",
    "@xmath0 are determined by eigenvalues ( eigenmodes ) of a dynamical matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is derived by considering small perturbations of individual particles ( with respect to a stable configuration , e.g. , a hexagonal monolayer for 2d crystals ) of the form @xmath2 .",
    "elements of @xmath1 are determined by properties of interparticle interactions and are functions of @xmath3 .",
    "if the interactions are reciprocal then @xmath1 is hermitian , and therefore the eigenvalues are always real ( i.e. , the modes are stable ) and the eigenvectors are orthogonal .",
    "the situation changes if the interactions are nonreciprocal  the eigenvalues in this case can become complex .    before specifying a particular functional form of interparticle interactions in 2d crystals ,",
    "let us generally assume the non - reciprocity and discuss common properties of the dl waves in this case .",
    "the dynamical matrix has the following form : @xmath4 the elements @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 determine the dispersion of two in - plane ( horizontal ) modes and @xmath8 characterizes the out - of - plane ( vertical ) mode .",
    "the elements @xmath9 emerge due to non - reciprocity and make @xmath1 non - hermitian .",

    "when solved for @xmath22 , each mode yields a couple of conjugate branches .    when interactions are nonreciprocal the modes are modified ",
    "they are described by eq .",
    "( [ dispersion1 ] ) with nonzero right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) which is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "the dl modes become coupled with each other and complex .",
    "is symmetric and hence can be reduced to the diagonal form also for @xmath24 , but with complex eigenvalues . ]",
    "now let us specify interparticle interactions .",
    "for the direct interaction between charged grains we naturally adopt the yukawa potential which is characterized by ( negative ) particle charge @xmath25 and the screening length @xmath26 . for the wake we employ the commonly used simple model @xcite of a point - like ( positive ) charge @xmath27 located at the distance @xmath28 downstream each particle and also interacting with the neighboring particles via the yukawa potential .",
    "the elements of the dynamical matrix ( [ matrix ] ) for such interactions are calculated in appendix  [ appendix1 ] , eqs  ( [ elements1 ] ) and ( [ elements2 ] ) . for brevity ,",
    "theoretical results in this paper are written in the dimensionless form  the frequency is normalized by the dl frequency scale , @xmath29 and the wave vector is normalized by the lattice constant @xmath30 : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "after the normalization , the dl modes depend on three dimensionless parameters ( along with the normalized wave vector ) : the screening parameter @xmath33 as well as the relative wake charge @xmath34 and distance @xmath35 . in experiments , @xmath36 is typically about unity whereas both wake parameters are usually small .",
    "elements @xmath37 [ eq .  ( [ elements2 ] ) ] are proportional to the product @xmath38 and hence the coupling between the dl modes is very small [ @xmath39 .",
    "it becomes important only if different dl modes intersect ( or they are very close to each other ) ; otherwise the coupling can be neglected and then the modes can be treated independently , as described by eq .",
    "( [ dispersion1 ] ) .",
    "let us elaborate on this point .",
    "behavior of two coupled modes , @xmath40 , in a close proximity of their intersection can generally be described by the following equation : @xmath41\\left[\\omega-\\omega_0-{\\bf u}_2\\cdot({\\bf k}-{\\bf k}_0 )      \\right]=\\epsilon.\\ ] ] here @xmath42 are the group velocities of the two modes calculated at a point @xmath43 of the intersection line @xmath44 ( the latter is determined by the shape of the crossing modes ) and @xmath45 characterizes the coupling . from eq .",
    "( [ dispersion2 ] ) one readily concludes that the effect of the coupling critically depends on the sign of @xmath45 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : when @xmath46 the crossing modes merge and form a complex hybrid mode in a narrow range @xmath47 , with re  @xmath48 and i m  @xmath49 .",
    "thus , one of the branches of the hybrid mode has a positive imaginary part and hence can be unstable .",
    "when @xmath50 the coupling is accompanied by reconnection ( formation of a `` forbidden band '' ) and the modes remain stable ( real ) .",
    "furthermore , the sign of the product @xmath51 in the unstable case determines the type of the instability , which is absolute for @xmath52 ( the case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and convective otherwise .",
    "now we can consider the dl modes described by eqs ( [ matrix ] ) and ( [ dispersion ] ) , with the dispersion and coupling elements from eqs ( [ elements1 ] ) and ( [ elements2 ] ) .",
    "the detailed analysis shows that the intersection of the transverse in - plane mode @xmath53 with the longitudinal in - plane , @xmath54 , as well as with the out - of - plane mode @xmath55 is characterized by positive coupling and therefore is accompanied by reconnection illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , so that the modes remain stable .",
    "moreover , the coupling for these two pairs of modes exactly disappears ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) if @xmath3 is parallel to one of the principal lattice axes ( i.e. , when @xmath56 or @xmath57 in fig .  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "in contrast , for the remaining pair of @xmath55 and @xmath54 the coupling is _ always negative_. as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , this results in the formation of the _ hybrid _ mode with the imaginary part i m  @xmath58 ( by the order of magnitude ) .",
    "if damping is low enough , this triggers the _ mode - coupling instability_.    thus , only the intersection between the out - of - plane and longitudinal in - plane modes is critical for stability of 2d plasma crystals .",
    "it is instructive to present a brief summary of the mode - coupling theory which was originally developed for a 1d string assuming the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions @xcite . as it follows from the subsequent analysis ( see sec .",
    "[ fingerprints ] ) , this approach yields very simple expressions which can be conveniently implemented for practical purposes ( e.g. , to calculate the instability thresholds , see sec .",

    "[ threshold ] they will be compared with the exact 2d results derived in this limit .      to conclude this section , we should make two specific remarks which might be useful when considering dl waves and their coupling :    \\(i ) the dynamical matrix @xmath1 is solely characterized by interparticle interactions , i.e.",
    ", does not depend on the damping rate @xmath12 .",

    "as regards the _ dispersion relations _",
    "@xmath0 , their dependence on @xmath12 is determined by the solutions of the quadratic equation @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the effect of friction on waves is straightforward : for weakly damped waves ( when @xmath67 , which is typical for experiments ) , one readily obtains @xmath68 . from the practical point of view",
    "this implies that one can analyze undamped dispersion relations ( i.e. , put @xmath69 ) and afterwards simply add @xmath70 to the resulting imaginary part , in a close proximity of @xmath71 and therefore is unimportant for the analysis . ] which simultaneously identifies the instability threshold for the hybrid mode ( see sec .",
    "[ threshold2 ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) for the analysis of wave modes in a crystal it is _ sufficient _ to consider the wave vectors from within the first brillouin zone @xcite which is shown in fig .",

    "hence , the wave vectors @xmath3 and @xmath74 which are different by a linear combination of the basis vectors ( @xmath75 ) are equivalent for wave modes , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "one has to remember this fact when analyzing dispersion relations at large @xmath77 . for instance",
    ", recently liu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite identified one of the `` hot spots '' seen in their fluctuation spectra ( in their fig .",
    "4c ) as a new hybrid mode .",
    "this spot is centered at @xmath78 , @xmath56 and therefore is located outside the first brillouin zone ; after the mapping with , say , @xmath79 , its position is @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( equivalent to @xmath57 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ; note also the change in the polarization , from the transverse to longitudinal ) .",
    "this naturally coincides with the position of the `` regular '' hybrid mode at the border of the first zone , whereas the `` original '' spot is merely its image outside it ( as illustrated in figs  [ fig3]c and [ fig4]b ) .",
    "in this section we present detailed discussion and analysis of distinct fingerprints characterizing the wake - mediated coupling of dl modes in 2d crystals . based on the results of sec .",
    "[ types ] we naturally focus only on the coupling between the out - of - plane and longitudinal in - plane modes , which causes the formation of the hybrid mode and can trigger the mode - coupling instability .    to illustrate key features of the mode coupling ,",
    "the theoretical calculations were combined with the results of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations ( see description in appendix  [ appendix2 ] ) .",
    "the dl wave modes were obtained from the simulations by plotting the so - called `` fluctuation spectra ''  intensity distributions of thermal velocity fluctuations in the @xmath82 space .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] represents a characteristic example of fluctuation spectra measured at the onset of the mode - coupling instability .",
    "it was obtained from md simulations performed for the conditions close to those of experiment by coudel _",
    "_  @xcite ( experiment ii in table  [ tab1 ] ) . in this case",
    "the out - of - plane and longitudinal in - plane modes are just barely touching .",
    "such `` shallow '' intersection is nevertheless sufficient to form a distinct hybrid mode and to trigger the instability .",
    "figures  [ fig3]a and b depict the dl modes in the @xmath83 plane ( positive branches ) .",
    "they are obtained for two directions of @xmath3 at @xmath56 and @xmath84 , respectively ( corresponding to the principal lattice axes , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . figure  [ fig3]c shows the intensity distribution in the @xmath3-plane ( integrated over frequency ) , which provides a `` top view '' on the fluctuation spectra ( dotted line shows the direction of @xmath84 ) .",
    "the hybrid mode can be identified in figs  [ fig3]b and c as `` hot spots '' located near the border of the first brillouin zone , where the intersection occurs ( note also images of the hybrid mode outside the first zone ) .",
    "the theoretical curves calculated from eqs ( [ matrix ] ) , ( [ dispersion ] ) , ( [ elements1 ] ) , and ( [ elements2 ] ) for the same set of parameters demonstrate excellent agreement with simulations .",
    "the reason why the fluctuation intensity is anomalously high at the position of the hybrid mode is the heating induced by the wake - mediated coupling .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] represents the marginally unstable regime , when i m  @xmath85 . in this regime (",
    "also observed in experiment @xcite ) the effective growth rate of the instability is low , which allows us to obtain the fluctuation spectra before the crystal is eventually destroyed .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the hybrid mode would usually appear as a `` hot spot '' even if the instability is suppressed by friction and i m  @xmath86 .",
    "this is because the heating due to mode coupling is present also in stable regime .",
    "it becomes negligible only when i m  @xmath87 , and then the fluctuation intensity coincides with the intensity of dl modes outside the hybrid zone ( where it is determined by the background neutrals or temperature of thermostat in simulations ) .    at the initial stage of the instability ( and , of course , when the instability is suppressed )",
    "the effect of nonlinearity on the dl modes is not significant . in this case",
    "the contour plot of the growth rate i m  @xmath88 reasonably reproduces the distribution of fluctuation intensity in the vicinity of the hybrid mode .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we plotted i m  @xmath88 predicted by theory and the ( frequency - integrated ) fluctuation spectra from simulations . at a later stage",
    ", however , a nonlinear coupling between different modes becomes essential .",
    "this results in a variety of new phenomena , such as the energy cascades from the `` hot spots '' in the @xmath3 space and the generation of secondary harmonics at the double frequency of the hybrid mode ( which are clearly seen in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless ,",
    "since the principal aim of this paper is to focus on distinct features of the _ linear mode coupling _ , we leave aside the discussion of numerous nonlinear coupling effects .    for the plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we used the same set of parameters as for fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , but for simulations we assumed periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the latter not only allowed us to directly compare the theory and simulations , but also to probe the effect of weak deviation from periodicity caused by the horizontal confinement .",
    "we see that the only noticeable difference between figs  [ fig3]c and [ fig4]b is the intensity of the hybrid mode .",
    "this reflects the fact that the growth rate of the instability critically depends on the interparticle distance @xmath30 ( resulting in exponentially growing difference in the heating at the initial stage ) .",
    "therefore in the case of parabolic confinement ( where @xmath30 in the center is somewhat smaller than the average value ) the intensity of the hybrid mode is higher than in the homogeneous case shown in figs  [ fig4]b .",
    "otherwise , the positions and the overall shape of the `` hot spots '' in these two plots practically coincide , suggesting that weak inhomogeneity which is always present in experiments due to the horizontal confinement does not really affect the periodic structure of the brillouin zones .    finally , to illustrate the difference between `` shallow '' and `` deep '' intersections of the out - of - plane and longitudinal in - plane modes , in fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    "we demonstrate the fluctuation spectra obtained for the eigenfrequency of vertical confinement @xmath89 which is slightly lower than that in fig .",
    "this naturally shifts the out - of - plane mode down and thus makes the resulting hybrid mode much more pronounced : figure  [ fig5 ] shows that for deep intersections the separate `` islands '' of the hybrid mode merge into a joint broad `` ring '' ( within the first brillouin zone ) and the `` hot '' region occupies substantially larger part of the @xmath3-plane .",
    "the magnitude of i m  @xmath90 for deep intersections is usually much larger than for the shallow intersections and therefore the threshold conditions to trigger the mode - coupling instability in the former case are substantially relaxed ( see discussion in sec .  [ threshold ] ) . note that in this case , in order to keep the crystal in the marginally unstable regime ( which allows us to recover the fluctuation spectra ) we increased the damping rate to @xmath91  s@xmath92 .",
    "the dependence of dl modes on the direction of @xmath3 is evident from the discussion above . for the hybridization and the onset of the mode - coupling instability",
    "this dependence becomes crucial and therefore it deserves a separate discussion .",
    "figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show that the first crossing of the out - of - plane and longitudinal in - plane modes always occurs at @xmath93 , at the border of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the area of the hybrid mode in the @xmath3 plane rapidly grows as the intersection gets deeper , and eventually the hybrid mode exists for any @xmath94 , as in fig .",
    "the crossing depth is controlled by changing the particle density or / and the eigenfrequency of the vertical confinement ( see sec .  [ threshold ] ) .    therefore , when the dl fluctuation spectra are measured in experiments , under conditions close to the onset of hybridization ( and , if not suppressed  of the mode - coupling instability ) , special attention should be paid to the orientation of @xmath95 with respect to the crystalline lattice . under these circumstances",
    "the direction should be chosen according to the purpose of the experiment : if detection of the mode coupling is the goal , then @xmath84 is the best choice ; if unperturbed modes are to be measured , then @xmath56 should be used .",
    "the experimental technique must therefore provide angular resolution , which is easily done for the in - plane modes , but is not always possible for the out - of - plane mode ( since it is difficult to achieve angular positioning of the plasma crystal in an experiment ) .",
    "for instance , if the out - of - plane mode is measured with a fixed side - view camera  @xcite then the angle @xmath94 is set during the experiment and can not be adjusted at the analysis stage , but if it is measured with a top - view camera ( from the variation of individual particle intensity )  @xcite then @xmath94-resolved wave spectra can be obtained .       at @xmath84 and parameters of fig .",
    "arrows indicate traces of mixed polarization .",
    "far from the hybrid mode ( `` hot spots '' ) the modes become purely out - of - plane ( a ) and in - plane ( b ) . ]    as we pointed out in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , the dl wave modes are independent only when the wake - mediated coupling can be neglected : far from the intersection or if the modes do not cross at all , the out - of - plane mode is purely transverse , one of the in - plane modes is longitudinal and the other is transverse . however , near the hybrid mode , where the coupling between the first two modes is strong , the theory predicts the emergence of _",
    "mixed polarization_@xcite : as the modes approach the junction point , their polarizations become _ oblique _ ( in the plane formed by @xmath3 and the vertical axis ) , but the eigenvectors remain _ mutually orthogonal_. at the point where they merge the polarization exhibits a discontinuity  the eigenvectors of the two modes form a single ( hybrid ) eigenvector with the elliptic polarization .",

    "the magnitude of this effect ( @xmath96 ) is quite small for typical experimental conditions , so that its detection requires very careful analysis and high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the mode - coupling theory predicts two distinct thresholds : ( i ) _ confinement threshold _ , which determines when the out - of - plane and longitudinal in - plane modes intersect ; it depends on the combination of the vertical confinement frequency and the lattice constant ( particle number density ) .",
    "this threshold identifies the sufficient condition for the hybrid mode to form , but only the necessary condition for the instability to set in .",
    "the sufficient condition for the instability is determined by ( ii ) _ damping threshold _ ",
    "this identifies the critical value of the damping rate ( controlled by pressure ) below which the instability is not suppressed .",
    "let us discuss thresholds ( i ) and ( ii ) separately ( we recall that all frequencies are normalized by @xmath97 ) .",
    "the first intersection of the out - of - plane and longitudinal in - plane modes takes place at the border of the brillouin zone @xcite , for @xmath3 at @xmath84 .",

    "finally , all `` hot spots '' predicted by the theory and observed in simulations can be simultaneously seen in the experimental wave spectrum in @xmath3-plane , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9]c .",
    "next , we analyze the stability of 2d plasma crystals in terms of the confinement threshold ( which determines when the hybrid mode emerges ) .",
    "available literature data on stable and unstable crystals is summarized in table  [ tab1 ] , and the measured vertical confinement frequency @xmath178 is compared to the theoretical threshold @xmath179 in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "note that for the comparison we change the normalization of @xmath180 : instead of using @xmath97  a natural frequency scale in theory , now we employ the 2d analogue of dust plasma frequency , @xmath181 this normalization allows us to minimize the experimental errors , since the interparticle distance is usually measured with much higher accuracy than the screening length ( see footnote to table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows that all experiments listed in table  [ tab1 ] as having no mode crossing are indeed represented by points well above the confinement threshold line . to the contrary",
    ", the points for experiments marked by mode crossing are located very close to the threshold line or below it .",
    "the only exception is the experiment viii @xcite by liu _",
    "et al . _ : the wake - induced mode coupling was clearly seen in the fluctuation spectra measured in @xcite , but the reported experimental parameters ( yielding @xmath182 , marked by green up triangle in fig .  [ fig10 ] ) certainly do not allow the mode crossing , which indicates large measurement errors ( amended in the subsequent erratum @xcite ) .",
    "this example demonstrates that , by comparing experimental parameters to the theoretical confinement threshold near the point where the hybrid mode ( hot spot ) emerges in the fluctuation spectra one can perform very sensitive consistency test for the deduced parameters .      at this point ,",
    "let us briefly discuss the relation between the actual charge carried by particles and the effective charge which determines the dispersion properties of dl waves in 2d plasma crystals .",
    "the common method to determine @xmath25 and @xmath26 in 2d crystals is to fit the measured fluctuation spectra for the in - plane modes by theoretical curves .",
    "the method is based on the _ assumption _ that the interparticle interaction potential can be approximated by the yukawa form this deviation is negligible indeed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] and provides rather high accuracy .",
    "however , the dispersion relations are determined by the combined effect of direct interparticle interactions and the wake - mediated interactions .",
    "while the former contribution scales as @xmath183 , the latter depends on a particular form of the wake . for the model of a point - like wake charge used in this paper",
    "the wake - mediated interactions scale as @xmath184 , which modifies the dispersion elements of the dynamical matrix ( [ elements1 ] ) . in the limit of small @xmath64 ( which turns out to be a remarkably accurate approximation , see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) this yields the common renormalizing factor @xmath185 in eq .",
    "( [ elements1 ] ) , and therefore the dispersion relations are determined by the _ effective _ charge @xmath186 .",
    "this fact should always be kept in mind when fitting the fluctuation spectra by theoretical dispersion relations : in theory , frequencies are normalized by @xmath187 and hence the explicit dependence on the factor @xmath185 naturally disappears .",
    "this allows us , e.g. , to directly compare the experimentally measured values of @xmath188 with the theoretical confinement threshold without knowing the wake parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "of course , the comparison of theory and experiments in terms of the damping threshold requires knowledge of @xmath101 and @xmath64 , since the growth rate of the hybrid mode is directly proportional to the effective `` dipole moment '' of wake @xmath38 . as was shown in sec .",
    "[ threshold2 ] , in order to compare the measured value of @xmath189 ( last column of table  [ tab1 ] ) with the theoretical damping threshold plotted in fig .",

    "( [ universal_norm ] ) ; additional factor @xmath103 in the denominator here is because @xmath191 in experiments is determined by @xmath192 . in experiments , however , the wake parameters are generally unknown , so that a reasonable assumption should always be made in order to perform the analysis in terms of the damping threshold .      as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ threshold2 ] , under certain conditions the `` finite-@xmath64 '' correction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] can become important .",
    "in particular , this happens in `` marginal cases '' , when the normalized value of the confinement frequency is very close to the corresponding threshold line ( viz .",
    ", when the distance to the line is comparable or less than the correction ) .",
    "for instance , such situation might occur for experiments ii , vi , ix , and x shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . however , typical experimental errors are relatively large , so that accounting for the corrections is hardly required in these cases .",
    "as regards the comparison of theory with numerical simulations , where all input parameters are known precisely , the `` finite-@xmath64 '' corrections can become crucial . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider simulations of the shallow mode intersection shown in fig .",
    "the ( normalized ) confinement frequency in this case is @xmath193 _ larger _ than @xmath194 , i.e. , according to the universal criterion for the confinement threshold the system is still marginally stable .",
    "however , by taking into account the correction to the confinement threshold from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( which is about @xmath195 in this case ) we conclude that the system is in fact marginally unstable  as observed in the simulations .",
    "in contrast , for the case of the deep mode intersection shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( where the confinement frequency is just @xmath196 smaller ) the correction plays practically no role .",
    "the theory of mode - coupling instability @xcite provides detailed picture of a _ plasma - specific _ melting scenario operating in 2d plasma crystals .",
    "the melting associated with the wake - mediated coupling between the longitudinal in - plane and out - of - plane modes can only be triggered if ( i ) the modes intersect and ( ii ) the neutral gas damping is sufficiently low . even if the instability is suppressed by the damping and the melting does not occur , the coupling always results in the formation of a hybrid mode which is revealed in fluctuation spectra by anomalous `` hot spots '' emerging at distinct positions in the @xmath3-plane . in the vicinity of the hybrid mode , one can observe traces of mixed polarization for the two intersecting wave branches .",
    "in this paper we showed that all these features can be considered as distinct fingerprints to identify the onset of the wake - induced mode coupling .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to determine certain combinations of the crystal parameters with a fairly good accuracy .",
    "for instance , the theory predicts a well - defined confinement threshold ( for the ratio of the vertical confinement frequency to the dust - lattice frequency ) at which the `` hot spots '' emerge .",
    "it is noteworthy that the effect of wakes on the dispersion relations is automatically taken into account via the charge renormalization , which yields the effective charge ",
    "the value which is deduced from the analysis of experimental fluctuation spectra .    on the other hand , the damping threshold as well as the evolution of the mode - coupling instability (",
    "if not suppressed ) are determined by parameters of the wake  which are still poorly known for experiments . by identifying the onset of the instability and comparing it with",
    "the damping threshold derived above , one could obtain effective `` dipole moment '' of the wake .",
    "furthermore , one could measure the energy growth rate at the initial instability stage and compare it with the theoretical prediction .",
    "systematic studies in this direction would be highly desirable . however , we note that such measurements would only give us some mean characteristics of the wake , e.g. , the first ( `` dipole '' ) moment in the multipole expansion .",
    "we believe that future research into the stability of 2d plasma crystals should be focused , in particular , on the implementation of self - consistent wake models @xcite for the calculation of the mode coupling ( which should also account for the spatial variation of the interaction parameters @xcite ) .",
    "such studies will allow us to gain deeper insight into the plasma - specific mechanisms of melting operating in 2d systems and provide more reliable basis for future research into generic melting mechanisms .",

    "<S> experiments with two - dimensional ( 2d ) plasma crystals are usually carried out in rf plasma sheaths , where the interparticle interactions are modified due to the presence of plasma wakes . </S>",
    "<S> the wake - mediated interactions result in the coupling between wave modes in 2d crystals , which can trigger the mode - coupling instability and cause melting . </S>",
    "<S> the theory predicts a number of distinct fingerprints to be observed upon the instability onset , such as the emergence of a new hybrid mode , a critical angular dependence , a mixed polarization , and distinct thresholds . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we summarize these key features and provide their detailed discussion , analyze the critical dependence on experimental parameters , and highlight the outstanding issues . </S>"
