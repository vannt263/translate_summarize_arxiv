    "systems of particles interacting through two - body non - integrable potentials , also called long - range interactions , abound in nature .",
    "common examples are plasmas interacting through repulsive or attractive coulomb potential , self - gravitating systems ( globular clusters , galaxies ) involving interaction through attractive newton potential , two - dimensional turbulence , and many others . in addition , there are several model systems with non - integrable interactions which have been studied extensively in recent years , such as spins , vortices in two dimensions , etc @xcite .    very often , these systems are acted upon by external stochastic forces that drive them out of equilibrium . unlike systems with short - range interactions , stochastic forces in long - range interacting systems act coherently on all particles , and not independently on each particle .",
    "consider , e.g. , globular clusters being influenced by the gravitational potential of their galaxy , which produces a force that fluctuates along their physical trajectories . in addition , galaxies themselves feel the random potential of other surrounding galaxies , and their halos are subjected to transient and periodic perturbations , which may be due to the passing of dwarfs or to orbital decaying  @xcite .",
    "dynamics of plasmas are also strongly influenced by fluctuating electric and magnetic fields due to the ever - changing ambiance @xcite . in situations of stochastic",
    "driving , the systems at long times often reach a nonequilibrium stationary state that violates detailed balance . in such a state , the power injected by the external random fields balances on average the dissipation , and there is a steady flux of conserved quantities through the system .    study of nonequilibrium stationary states ( ness ) is an active area of research of modern day statistical mechanics .",
    "one of the primary challenges in this field is to formulate a tractable framework to analyze nonequilibrium systems on a common footing , similar to the one due to gibbs and boltzmann that has been established for equilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "this paper provides , to our knowledge , the first study of ness in long - range systems with statistical mechanical perspectives .",
    "common theoretical approaches to study isolated systems with long - range interactions include the kinetic theory description of relaxation towards equilibrium . in plasma physics and astrophysics",
    ", this approach leads to the lenard - balescu equation or to the approximate landau equation  @xcite .",
    "one of the main theoretical results of this paper is a detailed development of a generalization of this kinetic theory approach to describe nonequilibrium stationary states in systems with long - range interactions driven by external stochastic forces , valid in the limit of small external stochastic fields .",
    "the nonequilibrium kinetic equation that we obtain describes the temporal evolution of the one - particle distribution function . in the limit of small external forcing ,",
    "the system settles into a stationary state , in which we find the one - particle momentum distribution to be non - gaussian .",
    "the predictions of our kinetic equation for spatially homogeneous stationary states compare very well with results of our extensive @xmath0-particle numerical simulations on a paradigmatic model of long - range interacting systems .",
    "our numerical simulations also exhibit a nonequilibrium phase transition between homogeneous and inhomogeneous states .",
    "close to the phase transition , we demonstrate the occurrence of bistability between these two types of states , with a mean residence time that diverges as an exponential in the inverse of the strength of the external forcing , in the limit of low values of such forcing .",
    "similar bistable behavior has recently been observed in two - dimensional turbulence with stochastic forcing @xcite .",
    "we believe that such phase transitions are essential phenomena for geophysical flows and climate , for which the two - dimensional euler equations are a simplified paradigmatic model .",
    "there exists a very strong analogy between the two - dimensional euler equations and the vlasov equation relevant for leading order dynamics of the model we discuss in this paper @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations of the present work is to be able to study analogous phenomena in a setup for which the theory can be more easily worked out .    in a recent letter , we reported on some of the above findings , in one of the first studies of non - equilibrium stationary states in systems with non - integrable potentials and driven by external stochastic fields @xcite . the aim of this paper is to present a detailed derivation of the results given in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as to report on additional empirical results , more specifically non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "@xcite presents a computation of the same kinetic equation as the one we describe in this work and in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the result is different .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we define the dynamics we are going to consider of a long - range interacting system driven by external stochastic forces .",
    "we also discuss the paradigmatic example of the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model . in section [ methods ] , we discuss the methods we adopt to analyze the dynamics .",
    "in particular , we give a detailed derivation of the kinetic theory to study spatially homogeneous stationary states of the dynamics .",
    "we describe the numerical simulation scheme that we employ to study the dynamics , specifically , to check the predictions of our kinetic theory .",
    "this is followed by a discussion in section [ results1 ] of the results obtained from the kinetic theory , and their comparison with numerical simulation results for spatially homogeneous stationary states . in section  [ results2 ] , we discuss the results of numerical simulations of spatially inhomogeneous stationary states",
    ". we report on the very interesting bistable behavior in which the system in the course of its temporal evolution switches back and forth between homogeneous and inhomogeneous states , with a mean residence time that we show to be diverging as an exponential in the inverse of the strength of the external stochastic forcing , in the limit of low values of such forcing .",
    "we close the paper with concluding remarks .",
    "some of the technical details of our computation are collected in the four appendices .",
    "consider a system of @xmath0 particles interacting through a long - range pair potential , and described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the coordinate and the momentum of the @xmath4-th particle , and @xmath5 is the two - body interaction potential .",

    "it is then usual to rescale time such that the inverse of @xmath13 multiplies the interaction term  @xcite . in self - gravitating systems ,",
    "the dynamics is dominated by collective effects , so that it is natural to rescale time in such a way that the parameter @xmath14 multiplies the interaction potential  @xcite .",
    "these facts explain the rescaling of the potential energy by @xmath14 in eq .",

    "however , in order to perform simple numerical simulations with which we may check the predictions of the kinetic theory , we specifically make the choice @xmath39 , that defines the stochastically - forced attractive hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model , as detailed below .      the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model is a paradigmatic model to study long - range interacting systems .",
    "the model describes particles moving on a circle under deterministic hamiltonian dynamics , and interacting through the interparticle potential @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "it displays many features of generic long - range interacting systems , e.g. , existence of quasistationary states  @xcite . in equilibrium",

    "when forced by the stochastic forces @xmath18 resulting in the dynamics ( [ equations_of_motion ] ) , we call the corresponding model the stochastically - forced hmf model .",

    "here , we develop a suitable kinetic theory description to study the dynamics ( [ equations_of_motion ] ) in the joint limit @xmath45 and @xmath50 . while the first limit is physically motivated on grounds that most long - range systems indeed contain a large number of particles , the second one allows us to study stationary states for small external forcing . moreover , for small @xmath51 , we will be able to develop a complete kinetic theory for the dynamics . for simplicity",
