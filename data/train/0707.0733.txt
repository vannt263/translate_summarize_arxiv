    "the investigation of rare semileptonic decays of the @xmath2 meson induced by the flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) transitions @xmath3 provide potentially stringent tests of standard model ( sm ) in flavor physics . in sm",
    "these fcnc  transitions are not allowed at tree level but are induced by the glashow - iliopoulos - miani ( gim ) amplitudes @xcite at the loop level . additionally these are also suppressed in sm due to their dependence on the weak mixing angles of the quark - flavor rotation matrix @xmath4 the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "these two circumstances make the fcnc decays relatively rare and hence important for the presence of new physics , commonly known as physics beyond sm .",
    "the experimental observation of inclusive @xcite and exclusive @xcite decays , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , has prompted a lot of theoretical interest on rare @xmath2 meson decays .",
    "however , in case of exclusive decays any reliable extraction of the perturbative ( short - distance ) effects encoded in the wilson coefficients of the effective hamiltonian @xcite requires an accurate separation of the nonperturbative ( long - distance contributions ) , which therefore should be known with high accuracy .",
    "the theoretical investigation of these contributions encounters the problem of describing hadron structure , which provides the main uncertainty in the predictions of exclusive rare decays . in exclusive",
    "@xmath7 decays the long - distance effects in the meson transition amplitude of the effective hamiltonian are encoded in the meson transition form factors .",
    "many exclusive @xmath8@xcite , @xmath9@xcite , @xmath10@xcite processes based on @xmath11 have been studied in literature and many frameworks have been applied to the description of meson transition form factors : among them the worth mentioning are constituent quark models , qcd sum rules , lattice qcd , approaches based on heavy quark symmetry and analytical constraints .",
    "many observables like forward backward ( fb ) asymmetry , single and double lepton polarization asymmetries associated with the final state leptons , have been extensively studied for quite some time for quark level processes @xmath12 .",
    "recently , belle@xcite has announced the first measurement of @xmath13 @xmath14 after which these radiative decays became topic of prime interest and their is lot of theoretical progress for which one can see the refs.@xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the semileptonic @xmath2 meson decay @xmath15 using the framework of gilani _ _ et al.__@xcite with @xmath1 is an axial vector meson .",
    "the axial vector mesons is distinguished by vector by an extra @xmath16 in the gamma structure of decay amplitude ( da ) and some non perturbative parameters .",
    "but the presence of extra @xmath16 does not alter the calculation except the switching of vector to axial vector form factors and vice a versa .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the theoretical understanding of exclusive decays is complicated mainly due to non - perturbative form factors entered in the long distance non - perturbative contributions .",
    "the aim of this work is to relate the various form factors in model independent way through ward identities .",
    "this enables us to make a clear separation between non - pole and pole type contributions , the @xmath17 behavior of the former is known in terms of a universal function @xmath18 introduced in the large energy effective theory ( leet ) of heavy ( @xmath2 ) to light ( @xmath1 ) form factors@xcite .",
    "the residue of the pole is then determined in a self consistent way in terms of @xmath19 or @xmath20 which will give information about the couplings of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 channel .",
    "the from factors are then determined in terms of the known parameters like @xmath24 and the masses of the particles involved which are then used to calculate the branching ratio and forward - backward asymmetry for these decays .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the effective hamiltonian formalism of semileptonic @xmath2 meson decays and will write down the matrix elements for @xmath25 decays .",
    "section iii discusses the ward identities and develop the relationship between form factors which results in the reduction of number of unknown quantities .",
    "the form factors thus obtained are used for the calculation of decay width and forward - backward asymmetry .",
