    "the electrophoretic motion of charged macroions in an electric field @xmath5 is a longstanding issue in colloid science @xcite .",
    "a complex interplay occurs between hydrodynamic , electrostatic , and thermal forces .",
    "a macroion of charge @xmath4 drags along an electric double layer ( edl ) of small counterions with it and the number of charges `` bound '' in the edl depends on the charge density , surface properties , ion concentration and liphophility of the macroion as well as the specific properties of counterions and salt ions  @xcite .",
    "since it is difficult to experimentally probe and control these different parameters at microscopic length and time scales , the interpretation of experimental results often remains unclear .",
    "there is , e.g. , no clear understanding of the variation of the mobility @xmath0 with the surface charge density @xmath1 of the macroion @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies on electrokinetic phenomena consider the coulomb interactions between macroions on the level of the linearized poisson ",
    "boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "this equation , valid for weakly charged macroions and low salt concentration , describes the formation of an edl .",
    "it results in a screened coulomb potential ( yukawa potential ) as the effective interaction potential between the macroions .",
    "the central parameter of this potential is the debye screening length @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 the screening parameter ) that measures the spatial extent of the edl . when a charged colloid moves in the presence of an electric field , the spherical edl is distorted and it is coupled to the hydrodynamic flow of the solvent . in theoretical approaches",
    "@xcite , hydrodynamic effects are incorporated by coupling the poisson equation for the electrostatics to the navier  stokes equations . in the resulting electrokinetic equations @xcite , so ",
    "called @xmath8 potential is a central quantity .",
    "it is defined as the electrostatic potential @xmath9 at a distance @xmath10 from the colloidal surface where the fluid around the colloid is at rest with respect to the colloid motion .",
    "the imaginary surface at distance @xmath10 from the colloidal surface is called surface of shear or slipping surface @xcite . some of the counterions that are between the surface of the macroion and the surface of shear",
    "are often assumed to move along with the macroion and define the so  called _ dynamic _ stern layer @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 potential can be related to the electrophoretic mobility @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 the steady  state macroion velocity ) . in the helmholtz ",
    "smoluchowski limit , i.e.  for @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 the radius of the macroion ) , the mobility of the macroion can be obtained from the @xmath8 potential via @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 is the permittivity of the surrounding medium and @xmath17 is the shear viscosity of the fluid . in the opposite hckel  onsager limit , @xmath18 , the mobility is given by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the definition of the potential @xmath20 at the surface of shear is usually based on no  slip boundary conditions at the colloidal surface @xcite . since @xmath21 implies a very small debye length , the distance of the surface of shear from the colloidal surface would be typically in the nanometer range . at",
    "such length scales the validity of no  slip boundary condition is not clear ( although a hydrodynamic description might be still valid @xcite ) .",
    "calculations of @xmath0 which cover the entire range @xmath22 from the helmholtz  smoluchowski limit to the hckel  onsager limit have been done by henry @xcite .",
    "but these calculations , valid for low @xmath8 , assumed that the counterion charge density is unaffected by the applied field .",
    "obrien and white @xcite did extensive numerical calculations to calculate @xmath0 versus @xmath8 for different values of @xmath23 in the framework of electrokinetic equations . for @xmath24 , they obtained a pronounced maximum when plotting @xmath0 as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "this behaviour is attributed to the competition between the driving force due to @xmath25 and the retarding forces due to the distortion of the charge cloud constituting the edl .",
    "the driving force increases linearly with @xmath8 ( which is proportional to @xmath4 ) , whereas the retarding force is proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "thus for high values of @xmath8 , @xmath0 decreases with @xmath8 because then the retarding force dominates .",
    "moreover , obrien and white found that for multivalent ions , the position of the maximum shifts to lower values of @xmath8 .",
    "they argue that the distortion of the double layer is increased by multivalent counterions resulting in the increase of retardation forces against the motion of the colloid .",
    "qualitatively similar results were also obtained by the non  linear solution by oshina _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and by perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath8 by booth  @xcite and overbeek  @xcite .",
    "there are also other models of more microscopic origin which look at charged systems , but these models focus mainly on the structure and dynamics of the dynamic stern layer in planar geometry  @xcite rather than on electrophoretic properties of charged spherical colloids",
    ". moreover , some of these studies disregard hydrodynamic interactions @xcite or consider only zero  temperature properties @xcite .",
    "electrophoresis experiments on colloidal suspensions @xcite allow to determine accurately the electrophoretic mobility @xmath0 as a function of different parameters such as @xmath22 , surface charge density of colloids , etc .",
    "however , it is difficult to disentangle hydrodynamic effects from those due to electrostatic interaction .",
    "moreover , in order to fit experimental data to theoretical models , `` renormalized charges '' of the colloids have to be introduced @xcite .    in a recent experimental study by martin ",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , a maximum was found in the electrophoretic mobility @xmath0 , plotted as a function of the macroion s surface charge density @xmath1 ( note that there is a linear relationship between @xmath1 and the @xmath8 potential in the framework of the linearized poisson ",
    "boltzmann equation ) .",
    "the latter maximum occurs in the case of a 2:1 ( counterion - charge : coion - charge ) electrolyte .",
    "a similar result can be also found in the numerical paper by obrien and white @xcite for a 2:1 electrolyte .",
    "however , the experiments were performed for systems of highly charged macroion s . in this case , it is not clear whether the calculations by obrien and white yield a correct description , even on a qualitative level . in this work ,",
    "we aim at addressing this issue by using computer simulation techniques that may elucidate electrophoresis with highly charged particles on a microscopic level .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of colloidal systems suffer from the large separation in length and time scales of solvent and colloidal particles .",
    "the problem of simulating millions of solvent particles to account for hydrodynamic effects can , however , be circumvented by using simulation techniques such as the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) @xcite method or other navier  stokes equation solver ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) to model the solvent . in this work ,",
    "we employ a hybrid lb / md method @xcite to investigate the electrophoretic motion of a highly charged macroion in an electrolyte solution , thereby modeling macroion and electrolyte in the framework of the so  called primitive model ( in a similar way as in ref .",
    "our aim in particular is to investigate those structural and dynamical aspects of the edl which are out of scope of mesoscopic theories .    in the following , we are interested in the case of high values of @xmath1 , i.e.  the regime beyond the aforementioned maximum in the @xmath27 curve .",
    "in particular the counterion distribution around the macroion is measured to provide insight into the electrical retarding forces affecting the mobility . in order to disentangle hydrodynamic from electrostatic effects ,",
    "the hydrodynamic medium ( lb fluid ) is also switched off , thus simulating the system via langevin dynamics .",
    "systems with monovalent and divalent salt ions are considered . in the latter case , the phenomenon of charge inversion is observed .",

    ", the effect of the solvent on colloidal particles ( macroions ) can be described by a langevin equation where one assumes that on the typical time scale of the colloidal particles their collisions with solvent particles are due to gaussian random forces @xmath56 .",

    "thus the macroion feels less frictional drag and , compared to the ld case , a higher value of @xmath0 is obtained .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , it is further explored how the counterion coupling with the lb fluid affects the colloidal mobility .",
    "we keep the friction coefficient for the macroion coupling to the lb fluid , @xmath58 , fixed and vary that for the microion coupling , @xmath89 ( for the definition see sec .",

    "our aim in this study is twofold : the onset charge density @xmath1 , at which charge inversion occurs , is determined and secondly , the extent of the stern layer from hd simulations is compared to that from ld simulations .    to this end ,",
    "two systems of a macroion of charge @xmath136 mixed with divalent microions are considered , one with @xmath162 divalent counterions and @xmath163 divalent coions , and the other one with @xmath165 divalent counterions and @xmath166 divalent coions . in each case , 3 monovalent counterions are added to maintain charge neutrality .",
    "the charge density @xmath1 is varied by changing the radius of the macroion @xmath14 from @xmath134 to @xmath135 , thereby keeping the radius @xmath76 fixed at @xmath134 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the mobility @xmath0 as function of @xmath1 is plotted for the different systems .",
    "different from the case of monovalent microions , @xmath0 changes its sign in all cases , thus indicating that at high values of @xmath1 the macroion is moving opposite to the direction of the electric field .",
    "overall , at a given value of @xmath1 , the mobility of the macroion in the presence of divalent microions is smaller than with monovalent ones .",
    "since the screening due to divalent microions is much more effective , the counterion charge density is higher near the colloidal surface than in electrolytes with monovalent microions .",

    "[ fig8 ] , where the system with @xmath163 coions is considered . the cumulative charge @xmath111 around the macroion is displayed for different values of @xmath14 corresponding to different values of @xmath1 at the fixed macroion charge @xmath136 .",
    "we see that for @xmath167 , @xmath111 develops a local minimum near the colloidal surface .",

    "[ fig8 ] for the largest and the smallest radii used , i.e. , for @xmath94  and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "we see that the charge profile for ld and hd is nearly identical , which shows that the dynamic stern layer is determined by the static coulomb forces . for higher salt concentration ,",
    "charge inversion is more pronounced , as seen by lower values of @xmath0 at high @xmath1 .",
    "both ld and hd show the phenomenon of charge inversion at high values of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular in the hd case , charge inversion is more pronounced for higher salt concentration . as in the studies with monovalent counter and coions , for divalent microions @xmath170 holds as well .",
    "in this work , a hybrid md / lb scheme was used to investigate the electrophoretic mobility of a macroion in an electrolyte solution .",
    "we have considered highly  charged macroions ( @xmath171c / cm@xmath105@xmath172c / cm@xmath105 ) for which theories based on the linearized electrokinetic equation are not applicable . for high values of the macroion s surface charge @xmath1 ,",
    "experiments on systems with multivalent salt ions  @xcite have shown that the electrophoretic mobility @xmath0 can decrease with increasing @xmath1 for @xmath173 salts whereas @xmath0 for @xmath174 salts , it shows a plateau . in our simulations , we observe decrease of @xmath0 with @xmath1 for both @xmath175 and @xmath174 salt . moreover , in contrast to previous theoretical studies @xcite , we observe a lowering of @xmath0 with @xmath1 even for @xmath176 for monovalent salt ions .",
    "the authors of @xcite , attribute the lowering of @xmath0 in the @xmath173 case to the presence of coions in the edl . as we have demonstrated in this work , a decreasing @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 requires the formation of a pronounced dynamic stern layer of charge @xmath2 , consisting of counterions that move along the same direction as the macroion in the presence of an electric field .",
    "the lowering of @xmath0 is directly related to the increase of the quantity @xmath3 which we call the screening charge fraction .",
    "the absolute value of screening charge fraction @xmath177 of the colloid ",
    "counterion cloud complex increases with increasing @xmath1 , reflecting a lowering of @xmath0 .",
    "note that the number of coions in the dynamic stern layer is negligible .",
    "furthermore , we observe charge inversion for divalent counter and coions , but only when we reach sufficiently high values of @xmath1 . at very high values of @xmath1 , @xmath0 for colloidal systems with monovalent salt ions",
    "tends to saturate , because there is no space to add more counterions into the dynamic stern layer .",
    "however , this is different when multivalent salt ions and counterions are used .",
    "then , @xmath178 holds and @xmath0 becomes negative .",
    "the distribution of charge in the edl for this case as a function of distance @xmath35 from the center of the colloid is non  monotic and completely different from what is expected from standard electrokinetic theories @xcite . though we have not carried out studies for the 2:1 salt case , it is possible that the discrepancy in the experimental results between the 2:1 and the 2:2 salt case arises from entropic / osmotic forces . the larger number of coions in the 2:1 salt ( compared to the systems with a 2:2 salt ) may lead to larger osmotic forces on the counterions which could result in larger values of @xmath2 for the 2:1 case .",
    "however , this issue can be resolved only after further investigations .    in the work of obrien and white @xcite",
    ", the lowering of @xmath0 with the @xmath8 potential has been attributed to the distortion of the edl .",
    "though the explicit measurement of the retarding force arising from the distortion of the edl is outside the scope of this work , we have shown that the charge distortion within the dynamic stern layer decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this is indicated by the lowering of the quantities @xmath155 and @xmath154 with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this observation combined with a host of other evidences presented in this paper , indicate that accumulation of charges in the stern layer is the dominant mechanism for the lowering of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 , providing that high values of @xmath1 are considered .    by comparing the lb / md ( or hd ) results to those from ld simulations , we were able to elucidate the role of hydrodynamic interactions . the structure of the stern layer is more compact in the langevin simulations .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions enhance the electrophoretic mobility and so they have the opposite effect to electrostatic screening .",
    "this is due to a backflow effect in the fluid which pushes the counterions to move along the same direction as the macroion .",
    "hydrodynamic forces have pronounced influence in the formation of the dynamic stern layer , especially for low charges .",
    "an interesting finding is that the mobility as obtained from hd relative to that from ld exhibits an almost linear increase with @xmath1 .",
    "further work on the role of hydrodynamic interactions for the electrophoresis of charged colloids is in progress .",
