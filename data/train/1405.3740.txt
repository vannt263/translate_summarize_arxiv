    "this paper is about quadratic ordinary differential equations ( odes ) and their discretization .",
    "odes can be either integrable or non - integrable . in this paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the case of integrable _ quadratic _ odes , and their discretization by kahan s method ( sometimes also called the hirota  kimura method ) ; see @xcite and references therein . in @xcite it was shown that the _ kahan method _ applied to the differential equation @xmath0 with quadratic vector field @xmath1 on @xmath2 , coincides with the runge  kutta method @xmath3 as already noted by kahan @xcite , the kahan method also coincides with a certain so - called rosenbrock method on quadratic vector fields , which reads as @xmath4 or equivalently @xmath5 in @xcite it was also shown that when applied to systems with a cubic hamiltonian the kahan method has a conserved quantity given by the modified hamiltonian @xmath6 and it preserves the measure @xmath7 this implies that when applied to quadratic hamiltonian vector fields in @xmath8 the kahan method yields an integrable map .    in this paper , we will be particularly interested in the question whether the kahan discretization of certain classes of integrable odes preserves integrability , i.e. , whether the discrete systems obtained from these integrable odes are themselves again integrable . because the kahan map is rational",
    ", the integrability criterion we use in this paper is that of degree growth ( or , equivalently , that of algebraic entropy ) .",
    "this criterion states that if the maximal degrees of the numerator and denominator of the iterates of a rational map exhibit polynomial growth ( rather than the generic exponential growth ) , the map is conjectured to be integrable @xcite .",
    "the salient feature is that the degrees of numerator and denominator here are calculated after cancellation of common factors , thus implying that integrable maps undergo a magically large number of such cancellations .",
    "( some publications on integrable ordinary _ difference _ equations are @xcite ) . in the current paper",
    ", we give some new examples and significantly generalize some of the examples in @xcite .",
    "our method is to first identify a candidate system or class of systems for which the kahan map satisfies the algebraic entropy criterion , and then to attempt to prove the systems integrability by finding a conserved measure and a sufficient number of first integrals .",
    "a second feature of our study is that , in view of the fact that the kahan method is affine - covariant @xcite , we attempt to express all results in a linear- or affine - covariant way and to work with linear- or affine - invariant classes of systems where possible .    our outline is as follows .",
    "section  [ section2 ] is on the application of kahan s method to _ autonomous _ quadratic odes .",
    "subsection  [ subsectionmanin ] treats the discretization of quadratic hamiltonian odes in @xmath8 , and its connection to manin transformations @xcite .",
    "subsection  [ subs : nambu ] discusses the discretization of quadratic odes in @xmath9 possessing two quadratic integrals .",
    "subsection  [ subs : suslov ] is about the discretization of generalized suslov sustems in @xmath10 , including the integrable cases @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "section 3 is on the application of kahan s method to _ nonautonomous _ quadratic odes .",
    "subsection 3.1 treats the discretization of certain riccati equations .",
    "last but not least , section  [ subs : painleve ] covers the ( non - autonomous ) first painlev equation @xcite , whose kahan discretization is also shown to be integrable . in this striking example the integrals are not rational functions and the mapping is not integrable in terms of elliptic or hyperelliptic functions .",
    "[ subsectionmanin ] let @xmath13 be an arbitrary cubic hamiltonian . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that kahan s method applied to the ode @xmath14 yields an integrable map of @xmath8 .",
    "the question thus arises whether this integrable map is new or is already known . here",
    "we show for one asymmetric hamiltonian as well as for all symmetric hamiltonians ( @xmath15 ) that the integrable map obtained by applying kahan s method to ( [ eq:1 ] ) is in fact a so - called manin transformation as in ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath20 is the third intersection point of the line tangent to @xmath16 at @xmath21 with @xmath16 , again counting with multiplicities .",
    "we next consider a pencil of elliptic curves , generally denoted @xmath24 .",
    "a base point @xmath25 is a point for which both @xmath26 and @xmath27 vanish , and must clearly be common to all curves in the pencil since @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath25 is a base point and that @xmath22 is not a base point .",
    "then the curve to which @xmath22 belongs is uniquely given .",
    "we can therefore extend the definition of @xmath30 above to the whole pencil , base points excluded .",
    "also , compositions of such involutions are well defined in this sense .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be base points in the projective plane .",
    "a manin transformation is the composition @xmath33 , defined on some subset of a pencil of elliptic curves .",
    "the significance of manin transformations is that ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.2.1 ) @xmath34 is the unique translation on an elliptic curve that maps @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",

    "the kahan map obeys @xmath312 giving a time - dependent integral .",
    "the two - dimensional nonautonomous map obtained by eliminating @xmath29 using the integral appears to be different from ( [ dpaini ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath313 is the kahan discretization of the ishii system , which was shown to be integrable in prop .",
    "[ prop : ishii ] .",
    "hence , the case @xmath314 may correspond to another integrable discretization of painlev i.    second , differentiating again gives @xmath315 .",
    "the kahan method applied to the first - order form @xmath316 has a polynomial integral @xmath317 , preserves the polynomial measure @xmath318 , and passes the entropy test , and hence may also correspond to another integrable discretization of painlev i.    third , all 6 painlev equations were written as nonautonomous planar hamiltonian odes by okamoto @xcite . in each case , the hamiltonian is a polynomial , and for painlev i , ii , and iv it is cubic . when written as 3-dimensional nonautonomous systems as in ( [ pisystem ] ) , no new cases of painlev ii or iv were found in which the kahan discretization passed the entropy test . however , the hamiltonian system @xmath319 is okamoto s form of painlev iv when @xmath320 .",
    "the mapping obtained by freezing @xmath308 at @xmath321 , and then applying the kahan discretization on @xmath322$]which is different from that obtained from the autonomizing version used above  was found to pass the entropy test for integrability in the cases ( i ) @xmath323 , @xmath324 arbitrary , @xmath325 and ( ii ) @xmath326 , @xmath327 , @xmath328 arbitrary .",
    "thus , the kahan method may generate integrable maps in these cases .",
    "in this paper we have extended and generalized the impressive list of cases presented in @xcite , for which kahan s method preserves integrability .",
    "in particular , we have expanded the list beyond maps that are integrable in terms of elliptic or hyperelliptic functions , to include our final example , whose discretization is an integrable painlev equation .",
    "it still remains to actually integrate the kahan map in many of these integrable cases as done here in section  [ sec:2.1 ] for the cubic planar hamiltonian case . in a future paper , we hope to generalize our work on quadratic differential equations , in the current paper and in @xcite , to the case of cubic and higher - order polynomial differential equations .",
    "echoing the sentiment expressed in @xcite , it is our hope that the present work may help the kahan  hirota ",
