    "idps bind to their partners and fold into a specific structure  @xcite . binding to nucleic acids leads to transcriptional or translational regulation , and binding to a signaling target leads to signal transduction .",
    "many idps are known as hub proteins in signaling networks  @xcite , and the evolutionary persistence of idps under selective pressure makes us think of functional advantages over globular proteins in signaling processes .",
    "one of the proposed advantages of idps is adaptability of their shapes to several binding targets , which is a suitable property for signaling hubs  @xcite .",
    "another proposed advantage of idps is the fast binding process due to its comparatively long capture radius  @xcite , which is called the fly - casting mechanism . in this study",

    ", an idp transiently interacts with a tentative target and searches for a biologically functional bound form .",
    "if the transient complex is not sufficiently stabilized by the intermolecular interaction , the complex is finally dissociated by thermal fluctuations with a comparatively short lifetime . since the lifetime depends on the free - energy barrier to dissociation , stabilization of the complex in the early stage of the binding process",

    "however , not all of the interaction sites are exposed outside of the target molecule and easily accessible , and the p27@xmath0/cyclin a / cyclin - dependent kinase 2 ( cdk2 ) complex is a good example of this .",

    "cdk2 of the binary complex has intramolecular hydrophobic interaction sites  @xcite which are finally exposed to p27 upon binding  @xcite . as another example , the phosphorylated kinase inducible activation domain ( pkid ) of the transcription factor cyclic - amp - response - element - binding protein ( creb ) , which is known to be an idp  @xcite , binds to the kid - binding ( kid ) domain of creb binding protein inserting one of the hydrophobic residues deeply into the buried interaction pocket of kix  @xcite . in both examples with hidden binding sites ,",
    "binding processes are not simple two - state transitions between a dissociated state and a bound state .",
