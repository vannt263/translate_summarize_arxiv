    "the nontrivial vacuum structure of non - abelian gauge theories @xcite plays an important role in particle theory .",
    "it underlies baryon - number non - conservation in electroweak theory and the existence of @xmath2-vacua in qcd .",
    "these @xmath2-vacua present a problem , since @xmath3 leads to cp violation in strong interactions , which is severely constrained by experiment . because the vacuum structure depends on topology of the gauge fields , it is sensitive to the dimensionality of space - time .",
    "so , one may wonder what happens to electroweak instantons and the @xmath2-vacua in scenarios where the number of space - time dimensions is extended beyond the usual four , and if perhaps a solution to the strong - cp problem can be achieved along these lines .",
    "topology of gauge fields is best discussed when the space is compact .",
    "so , in what follows , we consider only space - times of the form _",
    "d-1 r_1 , [ st ] where @xmath4 is a compact space , and @xmath5 corresponds to time .",
    "the case @xmath6 is a situation that can be of phenomenological interest , but we also consider abelian theories in @xmath7 , which are useful models .",
    "several kinds of such higher - dimensional scenarios can be considered .",
    "the simplest one ( and , as far as we know , the first invoked in connection with the strong - cp problem @xcite ) is when @xmath4 has the topology of a 4-sphere but the geometry of a 4-dimensional sausage : three dimensions large , and one small , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sausage ] .",
    "= 2.5 cm    another possibility is a brane - world : let the geometry of @xmath4 be more or less arbitrary  take a round 4-sphere , for example  but suppose that we live on a domain wall along the equator see fig.[fig : sphere ] .",
    "brane - world scenarios have been quite popular recently , but not exactly the kind we envision here  those where @xmath4 is compact .",
    "recently , a solution to einstein equations with this topology was found in @xcite .    finally , one can consider @xmath8 , where the extra dimension is an interval @xmath9 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbifold ] . in",
    "what follows , we will often call such an interval an orbifold ; these two terms will be used interchangeably .",
    "= 2.5 cm    a question closely related to topology of gauge fields is the existence of chiral fermions and of anomalies in the corresponding currents . indeed , by using an anomalous chiral transformation",
    ", we can rotate the @xmath2 angle out of the vacuum wavefunction and into the mass matrix of the fermions .",
    "this can be sometimes a very convenient way to represent the @xmath2 angle , since the @xmath2-dependence can now be picked up by a calculation of the fermionic determinant .",
    "yet , when we try to embed this picture into a higher - dimensional scenario , we encounter a paradox .",
    "the lore holds that there is no anomaly in @xmath10 ( or any other odd dimension ; in orbifold scenarios this applies in the bulk of the orbifold , but not necessarily at the boundary @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the chiral transformation , which we  from our 4-dimensional perspective  decided was anomalous , is in fact anomaly - free .",
    "does that mean that it can be used to safely rotate the phase of the mass matrix to zero , without any extra terms appearing in the effective action ? if that were true , it would imply , among other things , that any odd - dimensional theory solves the @xmath2-problem _ automatically _",
    ", i.e. , without any reference to the theory s specific dynamics . on the other hand , if we recall that at low energies our odd - dimensional theory reduces to a 4-dimensional one , and so must share its properties , this kind of automatic solution looks exceedingly formal and suspect .",
    "the present paper grew out of an attempt to resolve this paradox .",
    "the solution we are going to describe reminds us of the atiyah - patodi - singer theorem @xcite , in that it emphasizes the role of high - frequency fermion modes .",
    "although at low energies these modes are not observable directly , changes in their spectral asymmetry can lead to interesting low - energy consequences . at this point , though , the similarity with the aps theorem remains largely qualitative ; in particular , they consider an even - dimensional dirac operator , for which there is an anomaly , while we consider an odd - dimensional one , for which there is none .",
    "there is also some connection between our solution and the callan - harvey mechanism @xcite , which relates the anomaly in , say , four dimensions to a variation of a chern - simons term in five .",
    "however , the callan - harvey mechanism reproduces a gauge anomaly , while we are interested in a global ( i.e. , non - gauge ) chiral transformation . the chern - simons term is immune to global transformations and therefore by itself",
    "will not do the job for us .",
    "it is clear from the preceding that the paradox we are facing does not depend very sensitively on whether we are considering a non - abelian gauge theory in five dimensions , or an abelian theory in three .",
    "so , in most of the paper we concentrate on the second case as technically the simpler . with regard to the three types of extra - dimensional models listed above",
    ", we observe that , to our knowledge , chiral fermions have not been obtained for sausage - like compactifications .",
    "so , in what follows , we confine ourselves to brane - worlds and orbifolds .",
    "these two cases have many similarities and can be treated in parallel .    for the type of questions that we address here , the global topology of space is essential .",
    "we consider a brane - world for which the space is a two - sphere ( will be a four - sphere in the 5d version ) , with the domain wall positioned along the equator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : ferm ] , we describe how chiral fermions appear . in sect .",
    "[ sect : current_on_orbifold ] , we consider the ultraviolet anomaly , as given by nonconservation of the current in the odd - dimensional theory .",
    "this anomaly is zero on a sphere , while on an orbifold it is concentrated at the endpoints @xcite .",
    "we show that it can be alternatively interpreted as a flow of charge through the endpoints . in sect .",
    "[ sect : determinant ] , we compute the infrared anomaly  the dependence of the fermion determinant on the phase of the fermion mass . we find that it is nonzero and coincides , in the low - energy limit , with the dependence computed using the effective low - energy theory from the start .",
    "the mismatch between the two anomalies is explained in sect .",
    "[ sect : spectral_asym ] by considering the change in the spectral asymmetry of massive fermion modes .",
    "gauge - field dynamics , responsible for existence ( or non - existence ) of @xmath2-vacua , is considered in sect .",
    "[ sect : gauge_field ] .",
    "there , we find that even though there is no true @xmath2-vacuum on a sphere ( in agreement with topological considerations ) , one can have an effective , time - dependent @xmath2-angle . on the one hand , this suggests a solution to the strong - cp problem ; on the other , it can have interesting cosmological consequences , if the relaxation of @xmath11 occurs on the cosmological timescale . in sect .",
    "[ sect : disk ] , we briefly discuss the case when the space is a disk , which turns out to be similar to the case of a sphere .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] is a conclusion .",
    "for most of this section , we consider @xmath7 ( corresponding to two - dimensionalobservable \" space - time ) .",
    "generalization to the realistic case @xmath6 is straightforward in the case of orbifold and is expected to present only technical difficulties in the case of a domain - wall on a sphere .",
    "emergence of chiral fermions on an orbifold is well - known in the literature , see @xcite ( and also @xcite and references therein ) , but we nevertheless describe it here for completeness and to fix the notations .",
    "domain - wall fermions are well - known for the case when the extra dimension is a line @xcite . here , we are interested in the case when the higher - dimensional space is a sphere , with the domain wall positioned along the equator .",
    "our analysis of this case is , as far as we know , new .",
    "perhaps the simplest type of compactification leading to existence of chiral fermions is related to orbifolds .",
    "consider a 3d space - time of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath5 is ( non - compact ) time , @xmath13 corresponds to large observable dimension with size @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath9 is a ( short ) interval corresponding to extra dimension ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 .",
    "the dirac equation for the 3-dimensional two - component fermion ( t , x , z ) = (    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     ) s = ^2(x)(z - z ) and the boundary conditions p_l",
    "s_1i_z = r/2=0  ,   p_r s_2i_z = r/2=0  ,  i=1,2  .",
    "it is easy to check that it can be expressed through scalar propagators @xmath18 and @xmath19 as s_11&=&-(i ^a _ a - m(z ) ) ,   s_21=^ *  , + s_22&=&-(i ^a _ a + m(z ) ) ,   s_12=  , [ propag ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the chirality projectors .",
    "now we construct explicitly the green function @xmath22 needed for a number of applications .",
    "it satisfies the equation g_d(z , z)= ( z - z ) [ gd ] and the boundary conditions @xmath23 .",
    "let us define the function ( a , b)=_a^b _",
    "0(z)^2  dz  , [ defrho ] where @xmath24 is the zero mode defined in ( [ zero ] ) .",
    "the obvious properties of the function @xmath25 are : @xmath26 . then one can easily check that the function g_d(z , z)= satisfies eq .",
    "( [ gd ] ) and the boundary conditions .",
    "another function we will need is g_d(z)g_d(z , z)=  .",
    "now , we give the explicit expressions for the green functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 in a theory with @xmath29 : g_d(0,z , z)= & & g_n(0,z , z)=- & &  .    finally , we construct the green function @xmath30 for a sharp domain wall residing in an infinite space - time .",
    "for this we put in ( [ fou ] ) m(z ) = m_0 ( z ) and define a function ( z)= ( z)e^-e(k ) z + ( -z)(e^-e(k ) z - e^e(k ) z )  , where e(k)=",
    ". then g_d(k;z , z)=(z - z)(z)(-z)+(z-z)(z)(-z )  .",
    "in this appendix we will show that the flux of the gauge current depends on the value of the gauge field at the end points of interval only .",
    "note that in 3d no regularization is needed as all integrals are convergent .    for slowly varying in @xmath31 gauge fields the expression for the current can be written as [ cursl ] j^2(x^,z)=",
    "d^2x dz _ f^(x,z ) + x^  & & . the integral over @xmath32 can be performed ( going first to momentum space ) to give j^2(x^,z)= dz_m=0_n=1g_mn(z , z ) m_n f(m_m , m_n)_f^(x , z )  , [ smc ] where g_mn(z , z)=and f(m_m , m_n)=  .",
    "now , if one puts @xmath33 directly in ( [ cursl ] ) one gets zero because the expression for the current contains @xmath34 which is zero at the end points because of the boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the limit @xmath35 is not equal to zero .",
    "the reason is that in spite of the fact that the sum in ( [ smc ] ) converges for any @xmath36 , its derivative with respect to @xmath37 does not converge at @xmath33 . as this is an ultraviolet effect which involves infinite sums ,",
    "the limit of small @xmath38 can be computed in a theory without mass term @xmath39 : the wave function @xmath40 and @xmath41 approach their limit ( [ psch ] ) for large @xmath42 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath43 can be expanded over a complete set of orthogonal functions on the interval as follows : _",
    "f^(x , z)= _",
    "k=0b_k(x ) 2k ( -)+ _ k=1c_k(x ) 2k ( - ) so that j= _ k=0b_k(x )  .",
    "for any fixed finite @xmath44 the limit of the second term is equal to zero as the sum over @xmath42 contains a finite number of terms . on the contrary , _ 0 _ n=2k^",
