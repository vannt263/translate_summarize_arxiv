    "<S> we study theoretically the electronic entropy and specific heat in diffusive superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider the influence of non - idealities occurring in an actual experiment , such as the presence of barriers at the ns interfaces , the spin - flip and inelastic scattering in the n region and quasiparticle subgap states in the superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that spin - flip and inelastic scattering do not have , for typical parameters values , a large effect . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of barriers suppresses the superconducting correlations in the n region , with the consequence that the entropy and the specific heat get reduced eventually to those in the absence of superconductivity for opaque interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> finally we suggest an experiment and check that it is possible , under realistic conditions , to measure the dependence of electronic specific heat on the phase difference between the superconductors . </S>"
