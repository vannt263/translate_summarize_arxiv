    "the angular - momentum projected dos is evaluated by integrating over a sphere centered at each atom with a radius of 1.0  for al and 0.9  for h , respectively .",
    "the choice of the h radius is based on the charge distribution around h in order to catch the charge transfer to h. the radius of al is then chosen according to the al - h bond length in order to cover as much of the interstitial region as possible without overlapping the spheres .",

    "the same radius values used in @xmath1-alh@xmath0 are adopted for integrating over the spheres around al and h atoms .",
    "the valence states below the fermi energy can be grouped into three energy regions : the low ( -8.7 to -7.0 ) , the middle(-6.8 to -4.0 ) , and the high ( -4.0 to 0 ev ) energy regions .",

    "this broad peak consists of the first two energy bands separated from the other bands at higher energies by a small gap . in figure",

    "again , the interaction between the h3-h3 pair is illustrated .",
    "in addition , considerable charge is found around four h4 atoms within the same hexagonal - ring as defined in figure [ fig : struct](b ) .",
    "therefore , the broad peak in the low energy region is attributed mainly to the unique double - bridge and hexagonal - ring structures in @xmath2-alh@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the projected dos associated with h3 is reduced in the middle energy region ( -6.8 to -4.0 ev ) compared with other h atoms .",
    "the missing amplitude is shifted to both the low ( -8.7 to -7.0 ev ) and high ( -4.0 to 0 ev ) energy regions .",
    "the former contains an increased h3-h3 interaction , the h - s and al2-s coupling , while the latter exhibits an enhanced interaction between h3-s and al2-p and -d states .",
    "the stronger interaction of h3-s states with higher - energy al2-p and -d states due to geometry gives rises to a higher electronic energy for the system .",
    "it is expected that the high vibrational frequencies of light hydrogen atoms may result in a significant zero - point energy , which needs to be included in studying the ground - state properties . in order to consider the zero - point energy @xmath33 contributions to the energetics between the two alh@xmath0 phases , the phonon density of states ( dos )",
    "are evaluated for both @xmath1- and @xmath2-alh@xmath0 .",

    "the total and projected phonon density of states for @xmath1- and @xmath2- alh@xmath0 are presented in the figures [ fig : alphonon ] and [ fig : gphonon ] , respectively .",
    "our calculated phonon dos for @xmath1-alh@xmath0 is in good agreement with previous calculations,@xcite showing three distinct groups in the whole frequency range .",
    "the decomposed phonon dos indicates that the low frequency modes below 350 @xmath42 are mainly from al atoms , while the middle and high frequency modes are h- dominated .",
    "this is due to the large mass ratio between h atom to al atom .",
    "the high - frequency phonons above 1550 @xmath42 are associated with h motion in the al - h bond stretching modes .",
    "no vibrational modes was found in the frequency region from 1025 to 1550 @xmath42 , yielding gap of 525 @xmath42 in @xmath1-alh@xmath0 .",
    "the phonon dos for @xmath2-alh@xmath0 is more complex than that for @xmath1-alh@xmath0 due to the structural difference .",
    "the @xmath2- phase unit cell has much more atoms ( 24 ) than the @xmath1-phase ( 8) , therefore the calculated phonon dos for @xmath2-alh@xmath0 in figure [ fig : gphonon ] exhibit more features . comparing with the phonon dos of @xmath1-alh@xmath0 ,",

    "the partial phonon dos is calculated for the four types of h and two types of al atoms , as illustrated in figure [ fig : gphonon ] .",
    "the new features labeled in figure [ fig : gphonon ] can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) four new vibrational peaks appear within the gap region of the @xmath1-alh@xmath0 spectrum in the frequency range of 1200 to 1500 @xmath42 .",
    "these are vibrational modes of h3 in the plane of the al2 - 2h3-al2 complex .",

    "( 3 ) an additional broaden peak appears in the low frequency region from 375 to 475 @xmath42 , which is dominated by al2 in - plane vibrational modes , coupled with some contributions from h1 and h2 atoms with little contribution from h3 .",
    "the displacements of the two al2 atoms have the same magnitude but opposite directions , indicating a paired motion between them . as a consequence ,",
    "these modes have higher frequencies than the other al modes .",
    "the first three new features are largely related to the motions of the two h3 and the two al2 atoms in the double - bridge structure .
