    "two dst procedures exist : the first assumes that the state to be reconstructed is pure , the second applies to general ( possibly mixed ) states . in the first case , we choose a basis @xmath0 on which to perform the reconstruction and a state @xmath1 that is complementary to all : @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the dimension of the system hilbert space ) . in the second case , we need a full complementary basis @xmath4 such that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "the dst with qubit pointer @xcite involves weakly coupling the system to a pointer qubit through a unitary coupling @xmath7 ( @xmath8 the pauli matrix ) and then performing separate projection measurements on the system and pointer it is also possible to choose a coupling @xmath9 : to first order in @xmath10 , this coupling gives the same results as @xmath11 .",
    "a choice @xmath12 is equivalent to introducing a phase factor @xmath13 to the @xmath14th component of the system state since @xmath15 , but this phase factor is not advantageous , and we use @xmath16 , as is customary in dst . ] .",
    "the coupling is such that the pointer , initially in an equal superposition @xmath17 , is rotated by an angle @xmath10 if and only if the system is in the state @xmath0 : @xmath18 after the interaction , we measure both : on the pointer we measure the expectation values of the pauli matrices @xmath19 and @xmath8 ( a projective measurement on two sets of complementary bases ) ; on the system we either perform a simple post - selection on @xmath1 ( if we know that the initial system state is pure ) or a measurement on the @xmath4 basis in the general case .",
    "consider the latter : after the projective measurement on the system with result @xmath20 , the pointer qubit is in the state @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the initial state of the system in the @xmath0 basis and the kronecker @xmath23 retains the memory of which state @xmath0 was coupled to the qubit .",

    "we have considered a pointer qubit , but analogous relations hold if one uses a continuous - variable pointer @xcite initially in a gaussian state @xmath36 . in this case , the interaction with the system shifts the pointer position by @xmath10 iff the system is in the state @xmath0 , through a unitary @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pointer s momentum operator . after a measurement of @xmath4 on the system ,",
    "the pointer is left in the state @xmath39 to first order in @xmath10 , the expectation value of the position @xmath40 and momentum @xmath38 of the pointer are proportional to the real and imaginary value of @xmath25 , so we can recover the state by inverting this relation : @xmath41 \\labell{rhog}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which ( to first order in @xmath10 ) gives the state of the system in terms of the expectation values of @xmath40 , @xmath38 of the pointer .",
    "all the above procedures , derived to first order in @xmath10 , are correct only in the limit @xmath42 . in ( real and simulated ) experiments",
    ", one has to use a finite nonzero @xmath10 : this is a bias that introduces an unavoidable error in the dst reconstruction ( we will show how to estimate it from the experimental data ) .",
    "note also that in the expansion that gives rise to eq .",
    ", the first order term is proportional to @xmath43 : if the overlap of the unknown state @xmath44 to be reconstructed and the post - selected one @xmath1 is small , the first order approximation may fail @xcite .",
    "in particular , it will be impossible to reconstruct a state that is orthogonal to the post - selected one @xcite . in practice",
    "it might be necessary to repeat the reconstruction using a couple of different orthogonal post - selected states ( e.g.  @xmath1 and @xmath45 ) , choosing the one that yields the least statistical fluctuations in the reconstructed state . the formulas for general states , eqs .",
    ", , are immune to this problem .",
    "tomography @xcite is a well - established unbiased state reconstruction technique , affected by statistical errors only .",
    "it can be understood very simply by considering the system operators as a hilbert space and choosing a basis @xmath46 for it .",
    "then any operator @xmath47 can be expanded on such a basis as @xcite @xmath48 \\labell{hs}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where tr@xmath49 $ ] is the hilbert - schmidt scalar product between operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "now , set @xmath50 , the state of the system , and choose a basis @xmath51 which is a function of an observable @xmath52 for all @xmath53",
    ". we can recover the state @xmath27 using eq .",
    ", since the trace there is just a function of the outcome probabilities of measurements of these observables : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath52 .",
    "the simplest example is the tomography of a qubit @xcite , where one can choose the pauli matrices @xmath57 as a basis set @xmath46 , so that eq .",
    "becomes @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue @xmath60 when measuring @xmath61 . for qudits with arbitrary dimension",
    "@xmath3 one can obtain similar relations from irreducible unitary representations of the @xmath62 group @xcite .",
    "we present a comparison between dst and tomography through simulated experiments . to gauge the quality of the reconstruction we use the trace distance @xcite @xmath63tr@xmath64 between the true state @xmath65 and the reconstructed one @xmath66",
    ": it gives the probability of error in discriminating among the two , @xmath67 , and is a number in the interval @xmath68 $ ] . even though this quantity is not accessible in experiments ( as typically one does not know the true state @xmath65 ) , for the pure - state case it can be estimated from the data ( see below ) .",
    "both dst and tomography are affected by statistical errors : in ( real and simulated ) experiments one must estimate the expectation values in eqs .  , , , and from a finite number @xmath69 of measurement outcomes .",
    "of course , the great advantage of dst is its incredible experimental simplicity but , as expected , tomography is much more efficient : using the same number @xmath69 of measurements it can achieve a smaller trace distance than what can be achieved through pure - state dst of eq .",

    "namely , achieving precisions comparable to tomography with dst requires orders of magnitude more data .",
    "moreover , the precision of pure - state dst has a very strong dependence on the overlap between the post - selected state @xmath1 and the ( unknown ) state to be reconstructed @xcite .",
    "in addition , dst is a biased technique due to the finiteness of @xmath10 . even increasing @xmath69 ,",
    "the trace distance @xmath70 will saturate to a nonzero value ( see figs .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] , [ f : mixed ] ) : even for infinite statistics @xmath71 the wrong state is reconstructed @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the state obtained from using the `` true state '' @xmath24 instead of using only its first order expansion in @xmath10 .",
    "this bias implies that ( in contrast to tomography ) in dst there is an optimal number @xmath69 of measurements that should be performed for each @xmath10 , namely the @xmath69 at which the trace distance @xmath70 starts to saturate ( black arrows in figs .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] , [ f : mixed ] ) : for smaller @xmath69 the trace distance has large statistical fluctuations ( fig .  [ f : errors ] ) , while for larger @xmath69 the trace distance does not decrease .",
    "this optimal @xmath69 depends on @xmath10 ( larger @xmath10 require smaller @xmath69 to saturate ) and on the unknown state , so it is unfortunately impossible to predetermine it before the experiment .",
    "nonetheless , one can still verify ( at least qualitatively ) when this number has been reached by estimating @xmath70 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath70 from the experimental data @xcite without any knowledge of the true state @xmath65 in the case of pure state dst ( see fig .",
    "[ f : vs ] ) .",
    "this can be done iteratively using @xmath74tr@xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the reconstructed state obtained from the experimental expectation values of @xmath77 in , while @xmath78 is the ` estimated true state ' obtained by analytically evaluating such expectation values on the state @xmath79 obtained from without first order approximation ( @xmath80 the norm and @xmath81 the components of @xmath82 ) . in other words , we estimate @xmath83 iteratively from @xmath84 where @xmath85 in the limit of infinite statistics , and where the same mathematical procedure gives @xmath73 from @xmath65 or @xmath86 from @xmath73 .",

    "this expression only uses the experimentally accessible data @xmath93 .",
    "[ an analogous procedure applies to the gaussian pointer , using eq .  .",
