    "bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 belongs to the family of mixed bismuth with the chemical formula ( bi@xmath7o@xmath7)@xmath8(me@xmath9o@xmath10)@xmath11 first synthesized and described by aurivillius,@xcite which became subject to many subsequent studies.@xcite in the above formula , me stands for a mono- , di- , or trivalent ion or a mixture of those ; @xmath12 represents ti@xmath13 , nb@xmath14 , or ta@xmath14 ; and @xmath15=2 , 3 , 4 , etc .",
    "the crystal structure of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 can be described as a stacking of bi@xmath7o@xmath16 and bi@xmath7ti@xmath4o@xmath17 layers along the pseudotetragonal c axis ( see fig .  1 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in the bi@xmath7ti@xmath4o@xmath17 units , ti ions are coordinated by oxygen octahedra , which form linear chains , and bi ions occupy the interstitials outside the tio@xmath18 octahedra .",
    "it was pointed out in ref.@xcite that the bi@xmath7ti@xmath4o@xmath17 unit has some similarity with the perovskite structure , and the height of the perovskite - type layer sandwiched between bi@xmath7o@xmath16 layers is equal to six ti  o distances or to three abo@xmath4 perovskite units .    according to some empirical rules,@xcite",
    "such a type of structure with highly charged cations surrounded by oxygen octahedra , which are linked through corners , is favorable for the occurence of ferroelectricity , which was indeed found in bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 by subbarao.@xcite recently , it was shown that ferroelectric bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 thin films can find an application in electrooptic devices.@xcite    another intriguing aspect of this material is its relation to high-@xmath19 oxide superconductors .",
    "as has been recently found,@xcite one of the phases of the bi - ca - sr - cu - o oxide superconductors family with @xmath2080 k has a structure analogous to that of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 . in connection with this",
    ", some attempts for the search of different superconductors related with ferroelectric bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 have been undertaken.@xcite    the electronic structure and chemical bonding of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 has not been studied up to now . in the present paper we present , to our knowledge , the first band - structure calculations along with the first measurements of x - ray photoelectron spectra ( xps ) of the valence band and x - ray emission ti@xmath21 ( @xmath22 transition ) , ti@xmath23 ( @xmath24 transition ) , o@xmath25 ( @xmath26 transition ) spectra ( xes ) of this compound , which give a direct information about the total and partial density of states distribution in the valence band .",
    "single crystals of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 were grown using a modified nacken  kyropoulus crystal growth apparatus .",
    "the temperature was measured by a thermopile of four thermocouples ptrh6% versus ptrh30% ( el 18 ) and a digital multimeter ( sensitivity 0.1 @xmath27v ) . the multimeter and power supply of the resistance heating system were controlled by a computer .    according to the crystal growth experiments of burton,@xcite",
    "the solution consisted of 68 mol% bi@xmath7o@xmath4 ( johnson matthey , grade 1 ) , 20 mol% b@xmath7o@xmath4 ( johnson matthey , grade 1 ) and 12 mol% tio@xmath7 ( merck , optipur ) .",
    "the platinum crucible with the solution was placed on a ceramic support in the upper part of the heating system .",
    "the crystals were grown on small , thin ( 001 ) seeds . at a temperature of about 1270 k",
    ", they were carefully placed on the solution surface , where they stayed due to the surface tension .",
    "temperature gradients up to 50 k / cm provide strong convection directed from the crucible wall to the center . as a result ,",
    "the growing crystal was fixed in the middle of the crucible .",
    "the cooling rate was 0.1 k / h at the beginning and 0.5 k / h at the end of the growth experiment .",
    "at a temperature of about 1200 k , the crystal was lifted from the solution using a platinum net and cooled down to room temperature at 15 k / h .",
    "crystals of about 12 g and a thickness of up to 3  mm were obtained .",
    "rectangular bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 samples were cut and subsequently polished to optical quality .",
    "ti  @xmath1 ( @xmath28 transition ) and o@xmath2 ( @xmath26 transition ) xes were measured with a x - ray spectrometer ( rsm-500 ) with a diffraction grating ( @xmath29=600 lines / mm ; @xmath12=6 m ) and electron excitation . in the course of xes measurements ,",
    "all precausions were taken in order to avoid the decomposition of the sample , or its modification under the electron bombardment : a very soft regime with a low current on the x - ray tube ( @xmath30=0.3 ma ) was taken , and the position of the sample with respect to the electron beam was changed for each scan .",
    "the spectra were recorded in the first order of reflection by a secondary electron multiplier with csi photocathode in an oil - free vacuum of @xmath31 torr .",
    "the entrance and exit slits of the spectrometer were 20 @xmath27 m wide , which gave an instrumental resolution ti  @xmath32 and o  @xmath2 xes of about 0.9 and 1.2 ev , respectively .",
    "the x - ray tube was operated at @xmath33=4.6 kev .",
    "ti  @xmath0 xes ( @xmath24 transition ) was measured using fluorescent excitation with a johan - type x - ray tube spectrometer with a position sensitive detector.@xcite a ( @xmath34 ) plane of quartz curved to @xmath12=2000 mm was used as a crystal analyzer .",
    "the primary cu  @xmath35 radiation was used for the excitation of the ti  @xmath0 spectra .",
    "the energy resolution was 0.3 ev .",
    "the sealed x - ray tube with a cu anode was operated at @xmath33=35 kev , @xmath30=50 ma .",
    "the time of accumulation of the ti  @xmath0 spectra was about 50 h.    x - ray photoelectron and core - level spectra of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 were measured using an esca spectrometer of perkin - elmer ( phi 5600 ci , monochromatized al  @xmath2 radiation , fwhm=0.3 ev ) .",
    "the resolution of the concentric hemispherical analyzer was adjusted to less than @xmath36 ev .",
    "a single crystal of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 was cleaved in high vacuum prior to the xps measurements .",
    "the spectra were calibrated using the c  @xmath37 line of small carbon contaminations of the surface as a reference level ( @xmath38=285.0 ev ) .",
    "a survey xps from the valence - band region is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ vb-2 ] .",
    "the unmarked feature at a binding energy of 23.5 ev is due to partial decomposition of the sample in the course of measurements that resulted in the formation of metallic bi at the sample surface . in order to avoid the charging , it was necessary to irradiate the sample with low kinetic energy electrons ( @xmath39100 ev ) . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ vb-2 ] , the evolution of the spectrum with the measurement time is shown .",
    "it has not been investigated whether the decomposition of the sample was caused by electrons or x - ray photons .",
    "based on the measured binding energies of the core levels from xps ( 531.50 ev for o  @xmath37 , 459.80 ev for ti  @xmath40 ) , it is possible to align the x - ray photoemission spectrum of the valence band and the individual x - ray emission spectra to a common energy scale with respect to the fermi level . since for dielectric materials the error of several ev in relative positions of the spectra due to charging effects is difficult to overcome ,",
    "we had to displace the spectra slightly in order to match the positions of the valence band in the xps and in the xes of components . more detailed structure of the valence band xps and xes on a common energy scale is shown in fig .",
    "the crystal structure of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 has been determined from x - ray and neutron diffraction experiments by dorrian _",
    "et  al._@xcite and was afterwards refined by david rae _",
    "et  al._.@xcite the material was found to be a displacive ferroelectric with polar orthorombic structure , with four formula units per unit cell and the lattice parameters @xmath41=5.45   , @xmath42=5.41   , @xmath43=32.83   .",
    "the space group is @xmath44 according to ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath45 as found in ref .",
    "any of these orthorombic structures is a commensurate modulation of the nonpolar orthorombic parent @xmath46 structure , which is derived from the idealized tetragonal @xmath6 structure .",
    "bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 exists in a @xmath46 structure above the ferroelectric transition temperature of 675  @xmath47c .",
    "we performed _",
    "ab initio _ band - structure calculation within the local density approximation ( lda ) , with the exchange - correlation potential parametrization according to von barth and hedin@xcite and gradient corrections as proposed by langreth and mehl.@xcite in spite of some argument that the multielectron correlation effects beyond the lda play a role in the formation of electronic sructure of titanium oxides@xcite , the only noticeable effect of correlations , if any , seems to be confined to the core - level region@xcite .",
    "therefore , one may expect the lda to provide an adequate description of the occupied electronic states within the valence band .",
    "specifically , we used the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital method ( tb - lmto ) in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa)@xcite , which was proven to be quite accurate and efficient in many applications .",
    "even with this method , the electronic structure calculation of the real orthorombic phase with 76 atoms per unit cell poses a problem .",
    "it is even more complicated by the fact that the crystal structure is rather open , apart from the chains of ti - o octahedra , which are intersected by warped bi - o - bi layers . in order to provide an adequate description of the potential over the unit cell",
    ", the structure has to be packed with additional empty spheres , which increase the basis set and the complexity of the computational problem even further .    in order to keep the computational effort in our band structure calculations manageable and to simplify the analysis of underlying trends in the electronic structure of the material",
    ", we prefered to perform calculations for the idealized @xmath6 crystal structure .",
    "it is a bodycentered tetragonal structure for which we used lattice parameters @xmath41=7.2558 a.u .",
    "( = @xmath48 of the orthorombic structure ) and @xmath49=8.55 .",
    "we used the atomic positions listed in table 6 ( model 3 ) of ref.@xcite and averaged them over sites that become equivalent in the @xmath6 structure .",
    "the resulting positions of atoms and empty spheres ( @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) are listed in table [ bitio : struc ] .",
    "the positions of the atoms may easily be seen from the charge density plots in two different planes cutting the unit cell , as obtained from self - consistent tb - lmto calculation ( fig .",
    "[ rho ] ) . due to the inversion symmetry",
    ", only half of the unit cell is shown . moreover , a @xmath52 $ ] translation maps the atoms and the charge density pattern onto itself . in the actual orthorombic structure ,",
    "o4-ti2-o3-ti1-o3-ti2-o4 chains of joined tio@xmath18 octahedra are rotated around the @xmath43 axis by up to 7.5@xmath47 ( in the opposite direction for adjacent chains ) , shifted in the plane normal to @xmath43 , and a tilting up to 6.5@xmath47 appears for octahedra within each chain .",
    "these distortions , which are well described in ref.@xcite , are not negligible but they are expected to have only a moderate effect on the basic band - structure properties , because the atomic coordination and distances between near neighbors are essentially preserved .",
    "since in the present work we are mostly concerned with spectroscopic information that is accumulated from crystallographically inequivalent atoms anyway and do not discuss the aspects of ferroelectric behavior , our structure model used in the calculations seems to be justified .",
    "the choice of the radii of space - filling atomic spheres for a lmto - asa calculation is not unique for compounds , especially for those including several types of atoms with different electronegativity .",
    "our choice was based on a compromise between possibly good matching of potentials at the sphere boundaries for all types of atoms and possibly low spheres overlap which we managed to keep below 30% of all interatomic distances .",
    "the final values of the atomic sphere radii @xmath53 together with the boundary values of the potential , adjusted in the course of iterations , are listed in table [ bitio : char ] along with the self - consistent partial charges inside the spheres .",
    "there is not much sense to consider the net charge @xmath54 within each atomic sphere , which is listed in the last column of table [ bitio : char ] , as direct reference to a charge state of the atoms in the compound , because this property of course depends on the definition and may vary considerably as based on the different estimates .",
    "it is reasonable , however , to analyze the changes of @xmath54 from one crystallographically inequivalent position to another within the same chemical species , because this gives clear indication of the charge transfer .",
    "the partial densities of states ( dos ) of the components as obtained from tb - lmto calculations using the tetrahedron method with 140 * k * points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone are shown in figs .",
    "[ ti ] , [ o ] and [ bi ] .",
    "as is seen from fig .",
    "[ rho ] , the ti atoms in bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 are surrounded by almost perfect o@xmath18 octahedra . with bi1 and bi2 atoms occupying the pores formed by 12 oxygen atoms of adjacent octahedra , a perovskite - type sequence of layers is formed : ( bi2-o4 ) ; ( o5-ti2-o5 ) ; ( bi1-o3 ) ; ( o1-ti1-o1 ) ; ( bi1-o3 ) ; ( o5-ti2-o5 ) ; ( bi2-o4 )",
    ". the corresponding repeated perovskite structure with the chemical formula bitio@xmath4 may , however , not be stable due to electrostatic considerations .",
    "the system gets stabilized by interchanging three perovskite - type layers with an additional o2 plane .",
    "this is accompanied by considerable warping of ( bi2-o4 ) planes and a noticeable [ 001 ] displacement of the ti2 atoms from the middle of o@xmath18 octahedra surrounding them .    according to our calculations , the @xmath55 dos at the ti1 site ( fig .",
    "[ ti ] ) is rather similar to that known for perovskite materials as batio@xmath4 and pbtio@xmath4 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite )  the ti@xmath55 states are concentrated at the bottom of the broad ( about 5 ev ) valence band . correspondingly , the o  @xmath56 dos at the o1 , o3 and o5 sites ( fig .  [ o ] ) are rather typical for oxygen in perovskites , with a pronounced maximum near the top of the valence band where o@xmath56 states are nonbonding .",
    "the nonsphericity of the charge density around the displaced ti2 atom in its oxygen cage is quite similar to that around ti in tetragonally distorted batio@xmath4 ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a considerable difference in the @xmath54 values at the ti1 and ti2 sites is only partially due to a small differences in the atomic sphere sizes , but comes mostly from a strong dynamic charge transfer along the ti2-o4 bond that occurs as this bond length is varied .",
    "this effect is well known for ti - based perovskite systems and is the driving force for tetragonal ferroelectric instability in batio@xmath4 and pbtio@xmath4 .",
    "quantitatively , this charge transfer or dynamic polarization of the ti - o bond is characterized by born effective charges , which were calculated by zhong _",
    "et al._@xcite to be @xmath577 at the ti site and @xmath585 at the o site ( as displaced towards ti ) in batio@xmath4 and pbtio@xmath4 , i.e. , very different from nominal ionic valence values .",
    "the reason why the o4 atoms aquire positive net charge in our calculations rather than become more electronegative as ti2 comes closer , is that the charge distribution at the o4 sites is far from being spherical symmetric and well localized .",
    "o4 terminates the chain of tio@xmath18 octahedra and is separated from the bi2 atom by an interstitial where we put an empty sphere @xmath51 .",
    "the charge transferred from ti2 towards o4 is , therefore , partially attributed to @xmath51 ( and also to @xmath50 ) empty spheres in our calculation .",
    "the energetics of the @xmath59 states ( fig .  [ o ] ) reveals that the effective potential is indeed less attractive for electrons at the o4 as compared to all other oxygen positions , thus indicating higher electronegativity , due to the ti2@xmath60o4 charge transfer .",
    "correspondingly , the center of gravity of the o  @xmath56 states is shifted to higher energies at the o4 site .",
    "since the valence band is essentially formed by hybridized o  @xmath56 , ti  @xmath55 and bi  @xmath61 states , the presence of only one ti neighbor and the remoteness of the bi neighbors to the o4 site isolates the o  @xmath59 states to a narrow flat band and reduces the effective width of the o4-@xmath56 partial dos .    the o2 sites , in difference to the other oxygen sites , which belong to the octahedra cage , form a basal plane for empty pyramides , or semioctahedra , with the apical points ( the by o4 atoms ) protruding up or down from the o2 plane in a chessboard configuration . the o2 atoms",
    "mediate the interaction between two bi2 layers , and the @xmath56 states of o2 exhibit noticeable hybridization with the @xmath62 and @xmath61 states of bi2 .",
    "summing up over all oxygen sites , the o  @xmath56 partial dos is asymmetric , with states near the top of the valence band dominating in the perovskite layers , and narrow band related to o4 sites giving the main contribution again at the upper half of the valence band .",
    "this state distribution is well revealed in the o  @xmath2 x - ray emission spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ o ] , lower panel ) , which probes the @xmath26 transition and thus is expected to scan the occupied part of the o  @xmath56 partial dos .",
    "the x - ray spectra of ti are shown in fig .",
    "the ti  @xmath63 spectrum probes the occupied part of the ti  @xmath64 dos .",
    "the lower of two pronounced peaks separated by @xmath6515 ev reveals the admixture of ti  @xmath64 states to the o  @xmath59 band .",
    "this energy separation is typical for all oxides and is well reproduced in the band structure calculation .",
    "the ti  @xmath32 spectrum consists of two subbands ( @xmath1 and @xmath66 , see fig .",
    "[ vb-1 ] ) which correspond to x - ray transitions with a valence band electron filling the core vacancy in the @xmath40 or @xmath67 level , correspondingly . since the ti  @xmath55 dos in the valence band dominate those of the ti  @xmath68 as is seen in fig .",
    "[ ti ] ( note the different scales for @xmath55 and @xmath68 dos ) , both subbands essentially reveal the same ti  @xmath55 dos distribution , modulated by a slightly different energy dependence of the dipole transition matrix elements for @xmath69 and @xmath70 processes , and somehow overlap . in order to enable the comparison with the calculated dos",
    ", we cut the experimental ti@xmath71 spectrum near the minimum and shifted the upper part downwards by 5.5 ev , that is the value of the ti  @xmath67ti  @xmath40 splitting in tio@xmath7.@xcite thus overimposed spectra , when compared with the calculated ti  @xmath55 dos ( fig",
    ".  [ ti ] , right panel ) , reveal all essential features of the occupied part of the ti  @xmath55 band .    according to our band - structure calculation ,",
    "the two inequivalent types of bi sites have quite different partial dos , which reveals the differences in their crystallographic environment .",
    "the @xmath62 states of bi1 atoms , which belong to the perovskitelike ",
    "bitio@xmath4  fragment of the crystal lattice , are filled and separated from the valence band by a gap of about 3 ev . the split - off bi  @xmath62 band of about 1 ev width is slightly hybridized with o  @xmath56 states at the neighboring o1 , o3 and o5 sites ( see fig .  [ o ] ) .",
    "some small fraction of the bi  @xmath62 states is moreover admixed to the low - lying o  @xmath59 states and to the higher states in the valence band .",
    "the partial dos of bi1 closely resembles that of pb in pbtio@xmath4 ( a tetragonally distorted perovskite , see fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with the only difference that the @xmath62 states of bi , which have one electron more than pb , are deeper ( by @xmath652 ev with respect to the valence band ) , more localized and exhibit less admixture to the states in the valence band .",
    "the @xmath61 states of bi1 participate mostly in the valence band , forming a pronounced bonding peak due to the hybridization with o  @xmath56 states at @xmath585.2 ev .",
    "this bonding state is visible in the o  @xmath56 dos at o1 , o3 and to a smaller extent at o5 sites .",
    "there is no essential charge transfer from the bi1 to the neighboring o atoms . on the contrary ,",
    "the large atomic sphere at the bi1 site accumulates some extra charge ( due to charge transfer from ti ) as compared to the free bi atom .",
    "in contrast to this , bi atoms , which belong to bi2o2 warped planes , exhibit a considerable loss of charge due to a more polar type of the underlying bonding than that in the perovskite - like fragments .",
    "the bi2-@xmath62 states are not fully occupied and participate in the chemical bonding .",
    "the partial dos at the bi2 site , with a @xmath653 ev broad bi  @xmath62 band and a non - negligible @xmath62 contribution just below the fermi level , has some similarity with that calculated for @xmath72-bi@xmath7o@xmath4 in ref.@xcite .",
    "a comparison of the valence band xps with the calculated total dos per unit cell is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath56 states are found in the calculation to agree well with the spectroscopic data .",
    "the position of the next distinct peak ( at about @xmath7310 ev in fig .",
    "[ tot ] ) , which reveals the bi  @xmath62 , states is again correctly predicted in the lmto calculation .",
    "it seems possible that the calculation overestimates the splitting of the bi  @xmath62 peak ( into two energetically separated parts related to the bi1 and bi2 sites ) that would otherwise be detected in xps at a given energy resolution .",
    "this discrepancy may be probably eliminated in a calculation considering a more exact structure model , where the relaxation of the tio@xmath18 fragments makes the potentials at inequivalent bi sites more similar .",
    "the xps peak at about @xmath7319 ev in fig .",
    "[ tot ] , which reveals the contribution from the o  @xmath59 states , lies approximately 2.5 ev below the position of the o  @xmath59 states according to the lmto calculation .",
    "this discrepancy is typical for lda - based electronic structure calculations of oxides , as compared to xps results , and is seemingly due to the effect of the hole relaxation , which effectively increases the binding energy of an electron leaving a comparatively localized state such as oi  @xmath59 .",
    "this effect remains beyond the lda , but may be correctly accounted for by more accurate treatment of correlation effects , e.g. , in a @xmath74 approximation , as was shown for mgo in ref .",
    "this effect is smaller for less localized states in the valence band .",
    "another discrepancy between the calculation and xps is that the split - off narrow peak associated with o  @xmath59 states of o4 atoms is not resolved in the measured spectrum .",
    "it is not clear at the moment whether the realistic geometry with relaxed tio@xmath18 octahedra smears out the difference between o4 and other oxygen sites .",
    "the effect of the o  @xmath59 holes , which should be stronger for more localized o4-@xmath59 states , also tends to increase the binding energy for the latter and thus to lower their separation from other o  @xmath59 states in the xps .",
    "it may also well be the case that two marked discrepancies from the experimental spectra ( the splittings of the bi  @xmath62 and o  @xmath59 bands ) are due to the crudeness of asa when applied to a quite open structure of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 , that can be checked in subsequent calculations not using any shape approximation for the potential .",
    "in the present paper , we present an analysis of the electronic structure of bi@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 by different spectroscopic techniques ( xps and x - ray emission spectroscopy ) , combined with an _ ab  initio _ band - structure calculation .",
    "it was studied how the observed valence - band spectra are formed by contributions from crystallographically inequivalent types of ti ( two species ) , bi ( two species ) and o ( five species ) atoms in the idealized @xmath6 structure .",
    "the main difference in the charge state and the type of chemical bonding is between those species of bi and o , which belong to perovskitelike fragments , on the one hand , and to intermediate bi ",
    "o planes on the other hand .",
    "the electronic structure related to perovskitelike fragments has many common features with those of perovskite - type compounds batio@xmath4 and pbtio@xmath4 , whereas the intermediate bi ",
