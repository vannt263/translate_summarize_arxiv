    "the split - quaternions , also called coquaternions , are elements of a 4-dimensional associative algebra introduced by james cockle in 1849 .",
    "they form a four dimensional real vector space equipped with a multiplication operation . unlike the quaternions , the algebra of split - quaternions contains zero divisors , nilpotent elements , and nontrivial idempotents .",
    "we denote the algebra of split - quaternions by @xmath266 .    the set @xmath267 forms a basis for the algebra @xmath266 .",
    "the products of these elements are given below : @xmath268 these are equivalent to the following set of equations : @xmath269 the conjugate of the split - quaternion @xmath270 is @xmath271 and its modulus is @xmath272 if @xmath273 then @xmath274 has an inverse , namely , @xmath275 .",
    "a split - quaternion is spacelike , lightlike or timelike according as @xmath276 , @xmath277 or @xmath278 .",
    "let @xmath199 be the set of real @xmath279 matrices .",
    "it can be easily verified that the map @xmath280 defines a bijection from @xmath266 to @xmath199 which is also a ring isomorphism .",
    "the inverse of the map is @xmath281 if @xmath282 then @xmath283 also , the identity matrix @xmath3 maps to the identity @xmath284 in @xmath266 .",
    "let @xmath285 be such that @xmath286 post - multiplying by @xmath287 we have @xmath288 clearly @xmath273 , because otherwise we must have @xmath289 and so @xmath290 which is obviously a contradiction .",
    "so we must have @xmath291 this yields the following equations : @xmath292      if @xmath293 then @xmath294 and so @xmath295 .",
    "tis would then imply that @xmath296 . hence @xmath297 and @xmath298 and hence @xmath299 .",
    "let @xmath300 .",
    "if @xmath294 then as above we have @xmath296 which leads to the contradiction that @xmath290 .",
    "now we must have @xmath301 that is , @xmath302 thus , the square roots of @xmath303 , other than @xmath304 , are split - quaternions of the form @xmath305 where @xmath306 satisfy eq .. if we identify @xmath306 as the coordinates of a point @xmath170 in ordinary three - dimensional euclidean space , then the set of points defined by eq .",
    "form a hyperboloid of one sheet .",
    "it follows that the set of square roots of @xmath303 can be identified with a hyperboloid of one sheet .",
    "we can find real numbers @xmath132 and @xmath15 such that @xmath307 thus we have the parametrized form for the square roots of @xmath284 : @xmath308      the square roots of @xmath309 are @xmath310 by the isomorphism between @xmath311 and @xmath199 , we see that the roots of @xmath3 are the following matrices : @xmath312 the third form for the square root can be expressed in the following form : @xmath313 the first term is a scalar multiple of a holder transformation which is a square root of @xmath3 and the second term is a scalar multiple of a square root of @xmath60 .      using an argument similar to one used to find the square roots of @xmath315 , we can see that the square roots of @xmath314 are split - quaternions of the form @xmath305 where @xmath306 satisfy the condition @xmath316 eq . represents a hyperboloid of one sheet in @xmath317 .",
    "thus the set of square roots of @xmath318 forms a hyperboloid of one sheet .",
    "we can parameterize @xmath306 as follows : @xmath319 then , we have @xmath320 using the isomorphism between @xmath199 and @xmath266 we see that the square roots of @xmath60 are of the form @xmath321 this can be expressed as @xmath322 the first term is a scalar multiple of a holder transformation and the second term is a multiple of a special square root of @xmath60 .",
    "we have been stressing the fact that @xmath0 have infinite number of square roots .",
    "now we investigate which other @xmath279 matrices have infinite number of square roots . in the sequel , we shall use the following notation : for any @xmath279 matrix @xmath221 , we write @xmath323 we have to determine for which @xmath221 s are the sets @xmath324 infinite .            we shall give a proof of the latter result .",
    "let @xmath330 then we have @xmath331 let @xmath332 .",

    "let @xmath246 be the jordan canonical form of @xmath221 and let @xmath245 be a non - singular matrix such that @xmath339 . by lemma , @xmath340 thus to find @xmath221 s having infinite number of square roots , it is enough to find @xmath246 s having infinite number of square roots .",
    "we consider the various forms of @xmath246 one by one .    1 .",
    "let @xmath341 so that @xmath342 clearly @xmath343 contains only the following four elements .",
    "@xmath344 thus @xmath324 is finite and contains precisely four elements . 2 .",
    "let @xmath345 , say .",
    "we have to consider two sub - cases : 1 .",
    "let @xmath346 therefore by lemma we have @xmath347 since @xmath348 is an infinite set , @xmath343 is also an infinite set .",
    "2 .   let @xmath349 now we can find the square roots of @xmath246 as in section 2 .",
    "it can be shown that the following are the only two square roots of @xmath246 in this case : @xmath350 3 .",
    "let @xmath351 , say .",
    "then we have @xmath352 in this case the only two square roots of @xmath246 are @xmath353 4",
