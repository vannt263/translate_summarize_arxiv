    "the problem of neutrino masses and mixing is the key problem of today s neutrino physics .",
    "the investigation of this problem is one of the major ways to search for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there exist three indications in favour of non - zero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing at present .",
    "the first indication comes from solar neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the observed deficit of solar @xmath0 s can be explained by neutrino mixing with @xmath1 in the case of msw transitions or with @xmath2 in the case of vacuum oscillations ( @xmath3 is the relevant neutrino mass - squared difference ) .",
    "the second indication in favour of neutrino mixing comes from the observed deficit of atmospheric @xmath4 @xcite . from the data of the kamiokande and super - kamiokande experiments",
    "@xcite it follows that a second scale @xmath5 exists .",
    "the third indication was obtained in the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "the data of this experiment are in favour of the existence of a third scale @xmath6 .",
    "there exist also data of numerous reactor and accelerator short - baseline ( sbl ) experiments in which no indications in favour of neutrino mixing were obtained ( see @xcite ) .    which information about the neutrino mass spectrum and neutrino mixing and what implications for future experiments can be inferred from the existing data ?",
    "we will discuss here these questions in the framework of a general phenomenological approach that takes into account only the unitarity of the mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "we will start with a few general remarks about neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "there are two possibilities for massive neutrinos ( see @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "massive neutrinos can be dirac particles like all other fundamental fermions . in this case",
    "the total lepton number @xmath7 is conserved and , in the simplest case , the number of massive neutrinos is equal to the number of lepton flavours . for neutrino",
    "mixing we have @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the unitary mixing matrix and @xmath10 is the field of neutrinos with mass @xmath11 .",
    "massive neutrinos can be truly neutral majorana particles . in this case",
    "the fields of neutrinos with a definite mass , @xmath12 , satisfy the majorana condition @xmath13 and there are no conserved lepton numbers ( @xmath14 is the charge conjugation matrix ) .",
    "the number of massive majorana neutrinos is equal to three if only the left - handed neutrino fields , which enter in the interaction , enter in the neutrino mass term .",
    "in general left - handed and right - handed neutrino fields can enter in the neutrino mass term . in this case",
    "the number @xmath15 of majorana neutrinos is larger than three and for the mixing we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a right - handed ( sterile ) field .",
    "let us stress that lep experiments on the measurement of invisible width of z - boson , that proved that the number of flavour neutrinos is equal to three , do not exclude the possibility of existence of more than three massive light neutrinos ( the right - handed fields do not enter in the standard neutral current ) .",
    "dirac neutrino masses can be generated by the standard mechanism with a higgs doublet if the right - handed fields @xmath17 enter in the lagrangian and are singlets .",
    "majorana neutrino masses can be generated only in the framework of theories in which lepton numbers are not conserved .",
    "the most popular mechanism of generation of majorana neutrino masses is the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is based on the assumption that the lepton number is violated by the right - handed majorana mass term at a scale @xmath18 that is much larger than the scales of the masses of leptons and quarks ( usually @xmath19 ) . in the standard see - saw case , for the neutrino masses",
    "we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass of the lepton or up - quark in the @xmath22-generation .",
    "thus , if the neutrino masses are of see - saw origin , there are three massive neutrinos with masses that satisfy the hierarchy relation @xmath23",
    "we will start with the case of three massive neutrinos @xcite and we will assume that there is a hierarchy of neutrino masses and @xmath24 is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar @xmath0 s .",
    "let us consider sbl neutrino oscillations in such a scheme .",
    "taking into account that @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the source - detector distance and @xmath27 is the neutrino momentum ) , for the probability of @xmath28 transition we have @xmath29 with @xmath30 . from this expression",
    "we easily find @xmath31 with the oscillation amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 given by @xmath34    in the case of a hierarchy of neutrino masses , only one oscillation length characterizes neutrino oscillations in sbl experiments .",
    "it is obvious that the dependence of the transition probabilities on the quantity @xmath35 has the same form as in the two - neutrino case .",
    "let us stress , however , that the expressions ( [ 08 ] ) and ( [ 09 ] ) are general and describe transitions between all three flavour neutrinos .",
    "notice also that in the case of a hierarchy of neutrino masses the cp phase does not enter in the expressions for the transition probabilities . as a result",
    "we have @xmath36    with the help of eqs.([09 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) , one can obtain bounds on the mixing parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 from exclusive plots that were found from the data of sbl reactor and accelerator disappearance experiments ( because of unitarity of the mixing matrix @xmath39 ) .",
    "we will consider the range @xmath40 from the exclusion curves of sbl disappearance experiments , at any fixed value of @xmath3 we obtain the upper bounds @xmath41 for @xmath42 . from eq.([11 ] ) , for the mixing parameters @xmath43 we have @xmath44 we have obtained the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the exclusion plots of the bugey reactor experiment @xcite and the cdhs and ccfr accelerator experiments @xcite ( see fig.1 of @xcite ) . in the range ( [ 13 ] ) we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( for @xmath49 ) .",
    "thus , from the results of disappearance experiments it follows that the mixing parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be either small or large ( close to one ) .",
    "now let us take into account the results of solar neutrino experiments .",
    "for the probability of solar neutrinos to survive in the case of neutrino mass hierarchy we have the following lower bound : @xmath50 if @xmath51 , from ( [ 16 ] ) it follows that at all solar neutrino energies @xmath52 .",
    "this is not compatible with the results of solar neutrino experiments .",
    "thus , the mixing parameter @xmath37 must be small : @xmath53 .",
    "we come to the conclusion that from the results of sbl inclusive experiments and solar neutrino experiments it follows that in the case of three massive neutrinos with a hierarchy of masses only two schemes of mixing are possible : @xmath54    let us consider @xmath55 oscillations in the case of scheme i. from eqs.([10 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) , for the oscillation amplitude we have @xmath56 i.e. the upper bound for the amplitude @xmath57 is quadratic in the small quantities @xmath45 , @xmath46 ; thus , in the case of scheme i @xmath55 oscillations are strongly suppressed .",
    "let us compare now the upper bound ( [ 18 ] ) with the results of the lsnd experiment in which @xmath55 oscillations were observed",
    ". in fig.[fig1 ] the shadowed region in the @xmath57@xmath3 plane is the region allowed by the results of the lsnd experiment .",
    "the regions excluded by the bugey experiment @xcite and by the bnl e734 , bnl e776 and ccfr experiments @xcite are also shown . the upper bound ( [ 18 ] )",
    "is presented by the curve passing through the circles .",
    "as it is seen from fig.[fig1 ] , the upper bound ( [ 18 ] ) is not compatible with the results of the lsnd experiment if the results of other oscillation experiments are taken into account .",
    "thus , the scheme i with a hierarchy of masses and couplings , similar to the hierarchy that takes place in the quark sector , is not favoured by the results of sbl experiments .    in the case of scheme ii , the upper bound of the amplitude @xmath57 is linear in the small quantity @xmath58 : @xmath59 .",
    "this upper bound is compatible with the lsnd data .",
    "note that , if scheme ii is realized in nature , @xmath60 and the vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 are superpositions of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for the neutrino masses we have @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath66 .    up to now",
    "we did not consider atmospheric neutrinos . in the framework of the scheme with three massive neutrinos and a neutrino mass hierarchy",
    "there are only two possibilities to take into account the atmospheric neutrino anomaly :    1 .   to assume that @xmath67 is relevant for the suppression of solar @xmath0 s and for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite .",
    "2 .   to assume that @xmath68 is relevant for the lsnd anomaly and for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite .    in first case ,",
    "the average survival probability of solar @xmath0 s is constant ( this is disfavoured by the data of solar neutrino experiments @xcite ) and the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 satisfy inequalities @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( that are not compatible with the lsnd result , as we have discussed above ) .    in the second case",
    "it is not possible to explain the angular dependence of the double ratio of muon and electron events that was observed by the kamiokande and super - kamiokande experiments @xcite .",
    "all the existing indications in favour of neutrino mixing will be checked by several experiments that now are under preparation .",
    "if for the time being we accept them , we come to the necessity of consideration of schemes with four massive neutrinos , that include the three flavour neutrinos @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath71 and a sterile neutrino @xcite .",
    "there are six possible types of mass spectra with four neutrinos that can accommodate three different scales of @xmath3 .",
    "let us start with the case of a hierarchy of neutrino masses @xmath72 , assuming that @xmath67 is relevant for the suppression of solar @xmath0 s and @xmath68 is relevant for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "the sbl transition probabilities are given in this case by the expressions ( [ 08])([11 ] ) with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "from sbl inclusive data in the range ( [ 13 ] ) of @xmath3 , we have @xmath75    for the survival probability of the atmospheric @xmath4 s in the scheme under consideration we have the lower bound @xcite @xmath76 now , from eq.([16 ] ) with @xmath77 and from eq.([20 ] ) it follows that large values of the mixing parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 are not compatible with solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "we come to the conclusion that both mixing parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 are small : @xmath80 and @xmath81 . as in the case of scheme",
    "i for three neutrinos , in the scheme under consideration the sbl amplitude @xmath57 is constrained by the upper bound ( [ 18 ] ) ( with @xmath73 ) , which is not compatible with the lsnd allowed region ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus , a mass hierarchy of four neutrinos is not favoured by the existing data .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn for all four - neutrino mass spectra with one neutrino mass separated from the group of three close masses by the `` lsnd gap '' ( @xmath82 ev ) .",
    "let us consider now the two possible neutrino mass spectra @xmath83 with two groups of close masses separated by a @xmath82 ev gap . in the case of such neutrino mass spectra ,",
    "the sbl transition probabilities are given by the expressions ( [ 08 ] ) and ( [ 09 ] ) and the oscillation amplitudes are given by @xmath84 where the index @xmath85 runs over @xmath86 or @xmath87 . from the exclusion plots of the bugey , cdhs and ccfr disappearance experiments we have",
    "@xmath88    if we take into account the results of solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments , in the case of scheme a we have @xmath89 the corresponding inequalities in the scheme b can be obtained from eq.([24 ] ) with the change @xmath90 .",
    "now , for the amplitude of @xmath55 oscillations , from eqs.([22 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) , in both schemes we have the upper bound @xmath91 \\ , , \\label{25}\\ ] ] that is compatible with the lsnd result .",
    "thus , schemes a and b can accommodate all neutrino oscillation data .    the schemes a and b give different predictions for the neutrino mass @xmath92 measured in @xmath93-decay experiments , and for the effective majorana mass @xmath94 that enters into matrix element of neutrinoless double - beta decay . in the scheme",
    "a we have @xmath95 in the case of scheme b , the contribution to the beta - spectrum of the term that includes the heaviest masses @xmath96 is suppressed by the factor @xmath97 .    for the the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double - beta decay , in the schemes a and b we have @xmath98    thus , if the scheme a is realized in nature , the @xmath93-decay experiments on the direct measurement of neutrino mass and the experiments on the search for neutrinoless double - beta decay can see the effect of the `` lsnd neutrino mass '' .",
    "finally , we will consider neutrino oscillations in long - baseline ( lbl ) experiments in the framework of the schemes a and b. we will show that the data sbl experiments imply rather strong constrains on the lbl probabilities of @xmath99 and @xmath100 transitions @xcite . in the scheme a , for the probability of lbl @xmath28 transitions we have the following expression : @xmath101 the probability of the @xmath28 transitions in scheme b can be obtained from eq.([28 ] ) with the change @xmath90 .",
    "let us notice also that the probability of lbl @xmath102 transition can be obtained from eq.([28 ] ) with the change @xmath103 .",
    "two reactor experiments , chooz @xcite and palo verde @xcite , are the first long - baseline experiments . from eq.([28 ] ) , for the probabilities of @xmath99 transition in the schemes a and b we have the following lower bounds : @xmath104 now , taking into account the unitarity of the mixing matrix , we can conclude that the quantities in the right - hand sides of the two inequalities ( [ 29 ] ) are large .",
    "thus , on the basis of the existing neutrino oscillation data , we expect that the probability @xmath105 is close to one . indeed , from eq.([29 ] ) , for both schemes we have @xmath106 for the transition probability of @xmath107 into any other state , from eq.([30 ] ) we have the upper bound @xmath108 the value of @xmath58 depends on the sbl parameter @xmath3 . in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "we have drawn the curve corresponding to the upper bound ( [ 31 ] ) for @xmath3 in the interval ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "the minimum values of the probability @xmath109 that is planned to be reached in the chooz and palo verde experiments are also shown .",
    "the shadowed region in fig.[fig2 ] is the region that is allowed ( at 90% cl ) by the data of the lsnd experiment and of the other sbl experiments .",
    "thus , as it is seen from fig.[fig2 ] , in the framework of the schemes a and b , the existing data put rather severe constraints on the lbl transition probability of @xmath107 into any other state .",
    "taking into account the unitarity of the mixing matrix and the cpt - theorem , it easy to see that the lbl probability of @xmath100 transitions is also strongly suppressed .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath110 another upper bound on the lbl probability of @xmath100 transitions can be obtained from eqs.([24 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) . for both models we have @xmath111    the upper bound for the lbl probability of @xmath100 transitions , obtained with the help of eqs.([32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) ,",
    "is shown in fig.[fig3 ] by the short - dashed curve .",
    "the solid line presents the corresponding bound with matter corrections for the k2k experiment @xcite .",
    "the dash - dotted vertical line presents the expected minimal value of the probability @xmath112 that will be reached in the k2k experiment .",
    "notice that at all the considered values of @xmath3 this probability is larger than the upper bound with matter corrections .",
    "the solid line in fig.[fig4 ] shows the bound corresponding to eqs.([32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) with matter corrections for the minos @xcite and icarus @xcite experiments , whose expected sensitivities are represented , respectively , by the dash - dotted and dash - dot - dotted lines .",
    "one can see that these sensitivities are sufficient to explore the region allowed by the results of the lsnd and the other sbl experiments .",
    "the existing indications in favour of neutrino oscillations ( coming from solar , atmospheric and the lsnd experiments ) require schemes with mixing of four massive neutrinos .",
    "we have shown that only two possible schemes with two pairs of neutrinos with close masses separated by a gap of about 1 ev can accommodate all the existing neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we have discussed the possible implications of these schemes for the experiments on the direct measurement of the electron neutrino mass , on the search for neutrinoless double - beta decay and for long - baseline neutrino experiments transitions were found in this experiment .",
    "the upper bound for the probability @xmath113 found in the chooz experiment is in agreement with the bound obtained in @xcite and presented in fig.[fig2 ] . ] .",
