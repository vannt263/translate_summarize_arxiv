    "the comoving star - formation rate ( sfr ) of the universe is in decline . since @xmath1 it has dropped by a factor of 315 @xcite . at higher redshifts",
    "it may have been constant or declining from @xmath1 to @xmath11 but the evidence is that @xmath1 is a critical point for the universal average sfr @xcite .",
    "this is a very dramatic conclusion and worth tackling with a variety of complementary observational techniques .",
    "one must of course consider how sfr is measured at different redshifts : for @xmath12 the principal observational probe has been rest - frame ultraviolet emission since it is easily accessible in optical bandpasses . because the uv derives from young stellar populations ( @xmath13gyr for @xmath14 ) the uv flux _",
    "produced _ per galaxy will be proportional to the sfr .",
    "there are details to do with the contamination from older populations but for @xmath12 and @xmath15  these are minor @xcite .",
    "a very important issue though is dust extinction which can be many magnitudes in the uv and in fact represents the principal uncertainty in whether the sfr drops off again at high redshift ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a comprehensive discussion of uv dust extinction issues is given by @xcite .",
    "another important issue is the treatment of cosmological surface - brightness dimming which may result in surveys missing a dramatic increase in sfr at high redshift @xcite .    at lower redshifts , where the rest - frame optical spectrum is accessible ,",
    "alternative methods of calculating sfrs from line emission can be used .",
    "the simplest is h@xmath8 which traces the number of lyman continuum photons @xcite .",
    "this technique has the advantage of using radiation emitted at red wavelengths and is thus considerably less sensitive to dust extinction compared to the uv .",
    "other lines such as h@xmath2 @xcite and [ oii ] @xcite are used but their relationship to sfr is more complicated . for @xmath16",
    "some of these lines are accessible in the optical and near - infrared windows and can be used to measure sfrs .",
    "a review is given by @xcite  the vast majority of the surveys that have been carried out indicate considerable evolution in the sfr for @xmath17 although there is disagreement on the amount of evolution required .",
    "a complementary method has been to probe the far - infrared emission of galaxies ( @xmath18 ) where dust - processed uv is re - emitted thermally . at high redshifts",
    "this must be followed into the sub - mm radio wavelengths .",
    "the emission has been used to constrain sfr at low - redshift @xcite and at high redshift @xcite but this approach suffers from both uncertainty in the dust modeling and a lack of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the latter issue is addressed by fitting the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) with a series of templates in order to photometrically estimate the redshifts , however there are huge degeneracies between the photometric redshift estimate and the assumed temperature of the dust sed @xcite .",
    "all these approaches involve estimating a luminosity , either continuum or line , per galaxy and then multiplying by the space density in order to give a luminosity per comoving volume . at this point the scale factor , sfr / luminosity , which is where the main uncertainties arise , allows transformation to sfr per unit volume .",
    "the light budget per volume is a useful quantity because it allows the stellar emission history of the universe to be decoupled , in a sense , from its dynamical history ( i.e.  changes in the number of counted objects by processes such as galaxy formation and galaxy - galaxy merging ) .",
    "this use of luminosity density is a _ direct _",
    "method , in which an observed luminosity density at a given redshift is converted to a sfr density at the same redshift .",
    "an alternative approach is that of fossil cosmology where the past history of the universe is determined from its current contents .",
    "this can be done by examining the resolved stellar populations in the local group @xcite or in ensembles of galaxies , for example in early type galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our approach is to look at the ensemble of _ all _ galaxies ; the ` cosmic optical spectrum ' of the local universe .",
    "this represents the luminosity - scaled spectra summed over all galaxies .",
    "the cosmic spectrum can be thought of as the total emission from all the objects in a representative volume of the universe .",
    "objects contribute to the cosmic spectrum according to their luminosity . as in the case for an individual galaxy ,",
    "this spectrum contains a luminosity - weighted mix of features from both old and young stars and we can fit models of star - formation history to it . in particular because the cosmic spectrum represents an average , it will represent the end point of the average sfh .",
    "thus we can fit much simpler models to the cosmic spectrum than are required for the spectra of individual galaxies , since we expect the sfh history of the universe , as a whole . to vary smoothly with time .",
    "this ensemble approach was applied by @xcite ( 2002 , hereafter bg02 ) to the cosmic spectrum ( meaning the optical spectrum per unit volume ) of 166000 galaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and derived constraints on allowable star - formation histories ( sfh ) which agreed well with results derived from direct high redshift measurements via luminosity densities .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides many advantages over the 2dfgrs for this type of analysis : it is of higher spectral resolution ( though we are not yet able to exploit this in this paper ) and will be about four times larger upon completion .",
    "the spectral wavelength coverage is larger ( @xmath19 for 2dfgrs and @xmath20 for sdss ) .",
    "the photometric calibration is much better as each sdss multi - fiber observation contains numerous standard stars and can be individually calibrated , whereas for the 2dfgrs a mean calibration was applied to all the survey spectra .",
    "the excellent spectrophotometry is borne out by the good agreement between synthetic colors computed from the spectra and actual colors which agree , in average spectra to @xmath21% ( tremonti 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "also the accurate five - color photometry allows comparisons of photometric constraints with color constraints .",
    "in particular sdss is selected in the @xmath6 band ( @xmath22 ) , whereas 2dfgrs is selected in @xmath23   ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus one would expect sdss to be more biased toward old massive galaxies and 2dfgrs to be biased toward young , star - forming galaxies .",
    "the comparison between the two allows us to investigate the uncertainties in the determination of the sfh .    in this paper",
    "we compute the cosmic spectrum for the sdss local volume , we make a direct comparison with that derived from 2dfgrs by bg02 , and we derive new constraints on star - formation history models from the sdss spectrum .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the sdss data and our methods for combining the spectra to form cosmic spectra . in section  [ sec : results ] we describe our modeling and fitting procedure and the outcome of the comparison of best fitting sfhs between the sdss and 2dfgrs surveys .",
    "we also test the consistency of models of sfh which form a lot of stars at @xmath12 . in section",
    "[ sec : phys ] we generate an absolute cosmic spectrum which we show in physical units .",
    "we use this to estimate emission - line luminosity densities and the current sfr density .",
    "finally we give our summary and conclusions ( section  [ sec : summary ] ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we take @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for our cosmological quantities , and where appropriate , define @xmath28 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey is a digital ccd survey in 5 optical bands which intends to cover up to 10000 deg@xmath29 .",
    "an overview is given by @xcite .",
    "the imaging camera is described by @xcite , the @xmath30 photometric system and calibration by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of sdss data is currently available to the entire astronomical community @xcite .",
    "the coordinate system is defined to a precision of better than 0.1 arcsec @xcite .",
    "the main galaxy sample is essentially a magnitude limited spectroscopic sample .",
    "it is selected as virtually all galaxies in the photometric area with a petrosian magnitude @xmath31 .",
    "the overall targeting completeness is 92% @xcite",
    ". for galaxies in this magnitude range the petrosian magnitude is close to total , they are also close to ` model magnitudes ' ( which are obtained by profile fitting ) which represent an alternative method of trying to estimate total magnitudes .",
    "ninety - eight percent of the galaxies span a redshift range of @xmath32 with a median redshift of 0.10 .",
    "full details of the spectroscopic main galaxy sample are given by @xcite .",
    "the sample we consider in this paper uses a total of 153000 galaxies selected to @xmath33 ( magnitudes are from the photo v5.2 software corrected for milky way reddening ; see @xcite for details ) from the sdss spectroscopic data .",
    "the sample is data from 463 survey quality plates in the north galactic cap which were observed between mjd 51433 and 5235 and 86000 galaxies lie in the range @xmath34 , the principal range considered in this paper .",
    "only galaxies with secure redshifts were selected .",
    "the spectra are taken through 3.0-arcsec diameter fibers and have a wavelength range of 3800 - 9200  and a spectral resolution @xmath35 which is approximately constant across the spectrum .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath36 per pixel ( pixels width @xmath37 12  ) .",
    "we use ` smear ' corrected spectra reduced using spectro2d software v4.9 .",
    "the smear procedure uses dithered telescope pointings to make a low - order correction to allow for aperture effects , it changes the large scale spectral response at the @xmath38% level in the mean colors .",
    "following bg02 , the spectra are combined in redshift slices ( using the redshifts from the princeton 1d spectra pipeline , @xcite ) by scaling them to their @xmath6 luminosity and summing them .",
    "this scaling provides for a first - order aperture correction .",
    "thus in each slice we get a total luminosity spectrum for all galaxies down to the luminosity limit of the survey at that redshift . because of the good spectrophotometry of sdss it is not necessary to apply a correction as was done by bg02 .",
    "there are two important issues in using the cosmic spectrum to constrain star - formation histories , the first is luminosity bias and the second is aperture bias .",
    "these redshift surveys represent the spectra of all galaxies down to a fixed _ apparent _ magnitude .",
    "for low redshift galaxies the magnitude limit will correspond to a faint luminosity . since luminosity densities from typical galaxy luminosity functions ( approximately @xcite ( @xcite ) functions ) tend to converge for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the schechter ` break ' absolute magnitude",
    "; once we have sampled more than 23 mags below @xmath40 the observed cosmic spectrum would be very close to the total spectrum . to be quantitative , for a faint - end slope in the range @xmath41 @xcite , integrating down to @xmath42",
    "shows that between 8494% of the light has been sampled .",
    "thus we expect samples to be highly complete in _ luminosity _ at low redshift and give a similar result whether they are selected in @xmath6 or @xmath23 .    at high redshift",
    "we expect the blue / red sample selection to become most prominent in the luminosity bias .",
    "in particular for the redshift range we consider the sdss red selection does not sample below the 4000  break ( figure  [ fig : selection ] ) where the uv from young stellar populations dominates .",
    "thus we would expect the relative bias to run in favor of older sfhs in the sdss sample as we approach @xmath43 slices .",
    "in contrast , at low redshift we expect _ aperture effects _ to be most apparent since the fixed size in arcseconds of the spectroscopic fiber aperture corresponds to smaller physical scales in the galaxy . at high redshift",
    "the effects are reversed  the fiber apertures ought to sample most of the light of a galaxy , but we are only seeing the most luminous galaxies and red versus blue selection becomes more important .",
    "these sample biases are quantified in figure  [ fig : sample ] which compares the two surveys .",
    "the sdss data gives us an opportunity to test for aperture bias in a way which was not possible for the 2dfgrs work : because of the excellent sdss imaging and photometry we can use galaxy colors as a function of aperture size as a diagnostic of aperture bias .",
    "for comparison between the two samples at a common redshift , we define the redshift limits so that the surveys penetrate to the same relative depth below @xmath40 .",
    "for example in the low redshift volume we use @xmath44 for sdss and @xmath45 for 2dfgrs , the redshift upper limit corresponding to @xmath46 in both cases .",
    "the 2dfgrs cosmic spectra are taken from those published by bg02 . in table",
    "[ tab : redshift - ranges ] we define low , medium and high redshift ranges ( a , b and c ) for which sdss and 2dfgrs are approximately equivalent in luminosity range .",
    "because the 2dfgrs sample is slightly deeper than the sdss sample , this correction also works in the direction of minimizing the physical aperture difference , since sdss fibers are bigger ( in arcseconds ) than 2dfgrs fibers .",
    "this procedure reduces the difference in physical aperture diameter in ranges a , b , c from @xmath4750% to @xmath4725% ."
