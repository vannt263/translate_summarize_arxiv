    "analyze the isothermal expansion and compression of a single classical gas particle in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics and show how some of the obstacles hampering analytical progress can be overcome .",
    "analogous to lua and grosberg we consider the particle being inside a cylinder with a moveable piston and make no a - priori assumptions about the piston speed such that also strong deviations from equilibrium are possible .",
    "we determine the distribution of work performed by the gas particle as well as the statistics of the heat exchanged with the reservoir . as a test of our findings we check their consistency with the jarzynski equality and the crooks fluctuation theorem @xcite .",
    "we then consider a cyclic process of carnot type consisting of two adiabatic and two isothermal strokes .",
    "combining the results of lua and grosberg for the adiabatic parts and our own findings characterizing the isothermal changes we determine the joint distribution of work and exchanged heats for one cycle of the engine .",
    "we show that even in the quasi - static limit of slow piston speeds fluctuations prevail and that the properties differ from those of the classical carnot process . finally ,",

    "single _ particle , there remain substantial fluctuations of @xmath22 , @xmath154 , and @xmath153 .",
    "this seems surprising since both work and heat are transferred in infinitely many collisions of the particle with the piston and the bottom , respectively .",
    "in fact , in the isothermal strokes the work is equal to the difference in free energy and therefore does not fluctuate . in the adiabatic strokes ,",
    "however , the individual collisions with the piston are all correlated with each other , the law of large numbers does not apply , and fluctuations in the work remain .",
    "it is these fluctuations from the adiabatic strokes that entail the non - trivial structure of the distribution for the total work .",
    "the heats exchanged with the reservoirs during the isothermal strokes are equal to the difference between the kinetic energy of the particle and the work performed , cf . and . in the quasi - static limit",
    "the work in the isothermal strokes does not fluctuate and the heats therefore just depend on the two random velocities of the particle at the beginning and at the end of the respective stroke .",
    "the influence of these velocities on the heats is not diminished by @xmath177 and consequently the central limit theorem is again not applicable .",
    "therefore , the distributions of @xmath154 and @xmath153 are non - trivial as well .",
    "if there are many particles in the cylinder their independent contributions combine and the results of macroscopic thermodynamics are , of course , restored .",
    "also the correlations between heat and work are interesting . since @xmath22 and @xmath154 depend on the same random variables , namely @xmath155 and @xmath157 , they are proportional to each other as expressed by . note that this relation also implies that the fluctuation theorem for heat engines as derived in @xcite is trivially fulfilled ..    in contrast , @xmath153 depends in addition on @xmath15 and the correlation with @xmath22 is not as strong as for @xmath154 .",
    "we need to emphasize , however , that there is some arbitrariness to these statements since they depend on where we define the beginning of our cycle .",
    "so far we have chosen the isothermal compression at the lower temperature as the first stroke , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : cycle_variables ] .",
    "if , instead , we were starting with the isothermal expansion @xmath22 and @xmath153 were proportional to each other and @xmath22 and @xmath154 would show only weak correlations .",
    "this is also the general picture for the quasi - static case : irrespective of the starting point of the cycle there is always one heat that is proportional to the work and one that shows relative fluctuations .",
    "this dependence on the precise definition of the cycle is restricted to the correlations , however , the marginal distributions of work and heat remain unchanged .",
    "we now come to the general case of arbitrary @xmath137 and @xmath136 , where the tpss operation is of particular interest . by definition , for the tpss operation the relation @xmath178 must hold .",
    "it seems to be difficult to determine these distributions analytically .",
    "we therefore rely on numerical results to characterize the tpss . to this end",
    "we start simulations in thermal equilibrium and let them run , until the distributions @xmath179 , @xmath165 and @xmath164 no longer change .",
    "all numerical data discussed in this subsection were obtained after such a transient phase .",

    "in contrast to the quasi - static limit , for finite @xmath137 and @xmath136 , the relations @xmath180 and @xmath181 no longer hold . yet",
    ", if the piston speed is not too large the work is still transferred in many independent collisions the number of which decreases with increasing @xmath136 and @xmath137 . by virtue of the central limit theorem one would hence expect that for small piston speeds the work variables @xmath182 and @xmath183 become gaussian distributed with their width increasing with increasing piston speed .",
    "this broadening of the distributions @xmath179 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 can be clearly seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : quasi_stat ] with figs .",
    "[ fig : fast_piston](a - d ) .",
    "when the piston speed increases further the probability for the particle to neither reach piston nor bottom during an entire cycle becomes noticeable . these realizations do not transfer work or heat and give rise to @xmath184-peaks in the distributions of @xmath22 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , cf .",
    "[ fig : fast_piston](c - f ) . moreover",
    ", typical particle trajectories now involve a few collisions only and the distributions of work and heat exhibit a much more spiky structure than those from the case of slow driving , see figs .",
    "[ fig : fast_piston ] ( e ) and ( f )",
    ". nevertheless we again find exponential tails for the marginal heat distributions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fast_piston ] similar to the results of @xcite for a brownian particle in a moving parabolic potential .",
    "we can no longer test our results against the fluctuation theorem for heat engines @xcite since the latter is valid only for cycles starting in equilibrium .",
    "based on the average power @xmath185 delivered by the cycle and the average heat fluxes @xmath186 and @xmath187 we may distinguish three different regimes of operation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regimes ] .",
    "the mean power @xmath185 is defined as the total average work per cycle @xmath188 divided by the duration of one cycle and the heat fluxes @xmath186 and @xmath187 as the average total heat transfers per cycle divided by the duration . in ( a ) the piston moves slowly and the engine produces power .",
    "the efficiency @xmath189 starts from the carnot value @xmath190 in the quasi - static limit and decreases monotonically down to zero at the border of this regime where @xmath191 . in the intermediate range ( b ) of piston speeds",
    ", the engine consumes work and heat is transferred from the hot to the cold bath .",
    "here @xmath192 is negative . if the piston moves still faster , ( c ) , work is consumed and both reservoirs are heated up . in this regime , @xmath193 is formally larger than one , but the device is clearly useless as a heat engine .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emp ] together with the curzon - ahlborn efficiency @xmath205 @xcite and the bounds @xmath206 and @xmath207 derived in @xcite .",
    "our findings are consistent with these bounds and almost saturate the upper one .",
    "the deviation from the curzon - ahlborn efficiency is not surprising since these authors assumed a well defined temperature of the working medium whereas our simulations show that the velocity distribution @xmath208 at maximum power is markedly different from a maxwell distribution .",
    "we also note that the numerical results for the emp reported in @xcite are somewhat larger than ours thereby violating the upper bound @xmath196 .",
    "this might be due to the fact that in this study the optimization of the power was restricted to @xmath200 , a relation that our optimized values for @xmath137 and @xmath136 do not fulfill .",
    "in the present paper we gave a detailed analysis of the stochastic energetics of isothermal compressions and expansions of a classical ideal gas consisting of a single particle . in our model the volume of a one - dimensional cylinder is changed by a piston moving with constant speed @xmath1 .",
    "the enclosed particle performs work by elastic collisions with this piston and exchanges heat in inelastic collisions with the bottom of the cylinder .",
    "the kinetic energy of the particle is of the order of the average thermal energy per degree of freedom .",
    "accordingly , both work and heat are strongly fluctuating variables , and our focus was on the determination of their probability distributions .",
    "the piston speed is arbitrary , and in addition to quasi - static volume changes we were in particular interested in situations where @xmath1 is comparable to the typical velocity of the particle .",
    "we first analyzed isothermal compressions and expansions . introducing a logarithmic time scale we were able to disentangle correlations between successive collisions of the particle which had hampered analytical progress so far . using elements of",
    "renewal theory we then calculated the characteristic function of the work distribution analytically .",
    "the distribution itself was determined using a numerical implementation of the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the results agree very well with molecular dynamics simulations and fulfill the jarzynski equality as well as the crooks relation . in the quasi - static limit",
    "we recover the result that the work ceases to fluctuate and coincides with the difference in free energy between the final and the initial state . for increasing piston speed",
    "we first find a broadening of this @xmath184-distribution into a gaussian before at even larger values of @xmath1 the typical number of collisions becomes of order one and a multi - modal shape of the work distribution emerges .",
    "we then combined these findings with the results of lua and grosberg for adiabatic volume changes to analyze a carnot - like cycle involving two isothermal strokes at different temperatures and two adiabatic strokes connecting them .",
    "for the quasi - static limit we derived analytic results for the joint distribution of the total work and the heat exchanged with the hot reservoir , as well as for the characteristic function of the heat exchanged with the cold bath .",
    "again the results are in very good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "somewhat surprisingly strong fluctuations in work and heat remain even in the quasi - static limit : only when considering a large ensemble of independent particles the results of macroscopic thermodynamics are recovered .    of special interest are again situations beyond the quasi - static regime .",
    "unfortunately , it seems very hard to determine the invariant density for particle position and velocity of the time periodic steady state describing the stationary operation of the cycle .",
    "therefore we had to rely exclusively on numerical simulations to explore the non - equilibrium performance of the cycle . for increasing piston speed",
    "the strong correlations between work and heat observed in the quasi - static limit get weaker .",
    "the work delivered per time increases and at intermediate values of the piston speed there is a maximum of the power output .",
    "we determined the efficiency at maximum power for several values of the parameters and showed that they are consistent with recently derived bounds .",
    "when the piston speed increases further a complicated , spiky shape of the probability distributions emerges . at the same time the efficiency deteriorates until finally the cycle ceases to work as a heat engine altogether : on average it then consumes work and heats up both reservoirs .",
    "it should be interesting to extend our investigations to the case where the position of the piston is not deterministically prescribed but is itself a fluctuating variable .",
    "it would then be possible to analyze the influence of intermingled forward and backwards steps which are characteristic for nanoscopic machines ."
