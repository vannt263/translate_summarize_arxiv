    "financial markets dynamics is driven by forces that show their signatures ubiquitously through the complex behaviour of the price historical time series @xcite .",
    "a major challenge is to seek connections between different aspects of complexity and to come up with some common mechanism able to explain these aspects coherently .",
    "there are two main elements that define the complexity of financial time series : the first is multifractality @xcite , which is associated to the behavior of each single variable and the way it scales in time ; the second is the structure of dependency between time series @xcite , associated with the collective behavior of the whole set of variables . so far ,",
    "these two manifestation of complexity have been investigated separately . in this paper",
    "we point out that -in fact- they are related and we propose a model that can reproduce the observed relationship . in spite of their intrinsic complexity ,",
    "prices show remarkable regularities , which are commonly referred to as stylised facts @xcite .",
    "these empirical features are somehow the footprint of some underlying layout which distinguishes prices from purely random processes .",
    "indeed , researchers have been progressively stranding away from the hypothesis of brownian motion , originally proposed by bachelier in 1900 @xcite , as a realistic model for the price evolution and more complex dynamics along with more refined models and mechanisms have been proposed over the past twenty years @xcite . for instance , prices increments at low frequencies ( intra - day to weekly ) are known to show non - gaussian behaviour and other distributions , for example student - t with degrees of freedom in the range @xmath0 $ ] have been shown to better fit financial returns @xcite .",
    "another ubiquitous property not exhibited by random noise is the presence of persistence in the price increments , responsible for a phenomenon which is commonly referred to as volatility clustering @xcite .",
    "volatility tends to cluster particularly over turbulent periods , where large fluctuations are observed more frequently than in tranquil market periods .",
    "both fat tails and time persistence are captured by a more general behaviour widely observed in financial markets across different asset classes : multifractality .",
    "multifractality is a measure of the complexity of the process , but at the same time it reflects its regularities , mirroring some of the most relevant stylised facts .",
    "many studies have investigated the multifractal behaviour of financial time series @xcite and several models have been proposed in order to explain its phenomenology @xcite .",
    "further to the complex and regular properties of the single prices , financial markets also exhibit distinctive cross - dependency patterns , which are well captured in the framework of network theory @xcite .",
    "the complex dependency structure of a multivariate dataset can be mapped into a structure of nested hierarchies of correlations through clustering methods @xcite which extract a hierarchy of nested clusters of stocks .",
    "the hierarchical organisation provides a very useful display of the hidden dependency patterns governing a set of stocks : it reveals which prices are more strongly correlated with respect to the rest of the market and it has been shown to match the intuition of explaining market moves in terms of few hierarchical factors @xcite . in this article",
    "we investigate the interplay between two measures of complexity in the stock prices time series , namely their multifractality and their hierarchical order measured through the dbht clustering algorithm @xcite .",
    "the first measure reflects properties of the single time series and , as repeatedly shown in many works @xcite , is influenced by two main factors : ( a ) a broad unconditional distribution of the process increments and ( b ) the long - range non - linear time dependence of the increments .",
    "the second deals with the complex cross correlation structure of a multivariate set of time series and therefore necessarily reflects some forms of interaction between stock prices . here we show that these two measures of complexity , associated with the irregularities present in the prices , are remarkably intertwined and show cogent correlations , especially for certain classes of stocks belonging to specific sectors of the market and to the set of clusters which best express the corresponding sectors . starting from these observations",
    ", we postulate the existence of a hierarchical structure of risks which can be deemed responsible for both stock multivariate dependency structure and univariate multifractal behaviour .",
    "we then construct a model that reproduces these empirical observations , built on the hypothesis that a complex hierarchy of risk factors affects the stocks heterogeneously .",
    "we show that a simple assumption of nested multiplicative risks can explain the observed correlations between multifractality and hierarchical order , hence providing new insights into the underlying mechanism governing financial markets .",
    "the dbht identifies clusters of stocks and generates a hierarchical organisations both intra - clusters and inter - clusters , which can be visualised by means of a dendrogram . while the intra - cluster hierarchy reveals the dependence between the different clusters , the inter - cluster hierarchy provides additional information about the nested organisation of stocks inside each cluster .",
    "we will refer to the junctions in the dendrograms as dendrogram nodes ( or simply nodes ) and to the hierarchical structure above ( under ) the cluster level as super ( sub)-cluster hierarchy respectively .",
    "the hierarchical structure produced by the dbht provides a natural way to associate with each stock a hierarchical order , that is the number of nodes above each stock along the path from the stock at the bottom of the tree to the top of the dendrogram .",
    "we will denote with @xmath1 the generic order and with @xmath2 the hierarchical order of a specific stock @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , @xmath2 measures how deep down the hierarchical tree lies a certain stock @xmath3 .",
    "a schematic hierarchical structure is given in figure [ fighierarchy ] .",
    "the hierarchical tree @xmath5 is defined to be the set of nodes along the simple path @xmath5 from the stock to the top of the dendrogram , i.e. @xmath6 , where we denote by @xmath7 the set of positive numbers identifying the nodes above stock @xmath3 .",
    "note that there s only one such simple path for each stock @xmath3 .",
    "then the hierarchical order is defined as the cardinality of @xmath5 , @xmath8 . in the example reproduced in figure [ fighierarchy ] , for the stock labeled by @xmath3 , we have @xmath9 , @xmath10 , i.e. the set of nodes denoted by the red dots and @xmath11 .    , while the thick red bullets are the nodes @xmath12 , which correspond to the risks stock @xmath3 is exposed to .",
    "note that the risk @xmath13 is common to all stocks , while other risks affect groups of stocks only .",
    "the dashed branches of the dendrogram indicate an arbitrary hierarchy .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in this paper we conjecture that the hierarchical order @xmath2 can be actually viewed as a measure of the riskiness of stock @xmath3 , because of its positive dependence with multifractality .",
    "this entails that the cross - correlation properties of the multivariate dataset are somehow entangled with the stylised facts displayed by the univariate time series . in particular",
    "the hierarchical structure of correlation provides likewise a snapshot of the hierarchy of risks in the market . to the best of our knowledge , up to now no attempt to uncover this kind of underlying structure has been made in the literature .",
    "we have considered daily stock prices comprising the 342 most capitalised stocks continuously traded in the nyse in the period 2 - 01 - 1997 to 31 - 12 - 2012 .",
    "data have been provided by bloomberg .",
    "the dataset includes stocks from 9 different market sectors , according to the bloomberg classification .",
    "the taxonomy of the stocks in the respective sectors is given in the supplementary material ( sm ) , where we also report details on the clusters detected through dbht clustering algorithm .",
    "we have chosen to perform the clustering through dbht after having verified that it works better than other methods including the single linkage cluster analysis ( slca ) @xcite in recovering a well - diversified hierarchical structure : slca in fact tends to produce very large hubs of stocks that bias the correlation hierarchical order .",
    "we have looked at the correlation between the hierarchical order and the multifractal properties of the stocks . as an indicator of degree of multifractality",
    "we have considered , as in previous studies @xcite , the quantity @xmath14 where @xmath15 for @xmath16 is the generalised hurst exponent computed from the linear scaling of the empirical q - moments ( see methods section for more details ) .",
    "we have removed from the analysis all stocks whose multifractality can not be statistically distinguished from zero , which correspond to weak multifractal behaviour and hence would not be relevant in this context . the benchmark value for multifractal stocks has been set to @xmath17 ( see methods )",
    ".     averaged over the stocks sharing the same hierarchical order , against the hierarchical order @xmath1 .",
    "the blue solid line is the linear fit over the averages , while the orange horizontal dashed line marks the limit up to which the increasing trend is observed .",
    "the error bars are the standard errors computed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the standard deviation over the stocks having same hierarchical order .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we plot in figure [ figallstocks ] the mean value @xmath20 with standard error @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 the standard deviation on the mean ) for each observed hierarchical order on all stocks analysed ( see methods for details ) .",
    "we observe a positive dependence between the two variables up to @xmath21 , followed by some noisier flat trend .",
    "the positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath1 is also confirmed by performing a t - test on the correlation coefficient validated with p - value @xmath22 .",
    "all stocks with hierarchical order in the range @xmath23 $ ] ( which accounts for @xmath24 of all stocks ) exhibit multifractal properties increasing along with their depth in the hierarchy of correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "the apparent saturation observed for orders larger than @xmath25 suggests that the hierarchical structure of cross - correlations may be responsible for the multifractal properties of the stocks only up to a certain order .",
    "let us note in particular that the number of stocks found with hierarchical order @xmath26 is too small to allow any robust statistical conclusion , which is also the reason why standard errors in figure [ figallstocks ] are very large for @xmath26 .",
    "we have investigated this relationship for other markets as well , namely : london stock exchange ( lse ) , tokyo stock exchange ( tse ) and hong kong stock exchange ( hkse ) .",
    "results and details are reported in sections 2 - 3 of the sm .",
    "the interdependence between multifractality and hierarchical cross - correlation order has been confirmed on data from lse ( see figure 3 in sm ) .",
    "the two asian markets show a much wider range of hierarchical order due to the appearance of one very large hub in the correlation network , which includes most of the stocks .",
    "this hub biases the evaluation of the proper hierarchical order .",
    "however , by detrending the time series we can remove the large hubs and , at least for tse data and only for the small hierarchical orders , retrieve a similar behaviour to that observed in figure [ figallstocks ] ( see figure 5 in supplementary material ) . as explained in detail in the sm though , detrending the series seriously affects the scaling properties of the data and the overall trend in the plots @xmath20 @xmath27 @xmath1 is fundamentally flat .",
    "nonetheless we mention ( and report in figure 4 in sm ) that without detrending the series the positive dependence between @xmath28 and @xmath1 is observed ( for small @xmath1 ) in both tse and hkse data .",
    "we have also detected the same positive dependence between hierarchical order and multifractality on specific market sectors and on clusters found through dbht clustering algorithm .",
    "we show in the top of figure [ figfinind ] plots of the multifractality indicator versus the hierarchical order computed on stocks belonging to financial and industrial sectors .",
    "the black dots are values for single stocks whereas the red squares are the average multifractal indicators for each order .",
    "we also plot the best fit on the dots ( thick blue line ) .",
    "both sets of stocks show a very well defined positive correlation between the hierarchical order @xmath1 and the multifractality indicator @xmath28 , which is evident from the positive trend recovered in both examples .",
    "again , the dependence is found to be significant with p - value @xmath29 . in figure [ figfinind ]",
    "we also report the trends observed on two of the largest clusters found through the dbht . the same positive correlation between multifractality and hierarchical order",
    "is observed on the clusters best identifiable with the corresponding sectors : the financial sector has large components in clusters @xmath30 and @xmath31 , whereas a large component of stocks from the industrial sector is found in cluster @xmath32 ( table 2 in the sm ) .     against the hierarchical order @xmath1 for stocks in the financial ( top left ) and industrial ( top right ) sectors and",
    "cluster 2 ( bottom left ) and cluster 3 ( bottom right ) . in all plots",
    "the blue line is the best fit of the dots , while the red squares are the averages of @xmath28 for each fixed order .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    all stocks belonging to the largest clusters and the corresponding sectors that better match the clusters show a tendency to pair high multifractality with depth in the hierarchy of correlations ( for other examples see sm ) .",
    "moreover , the positive trends have been also observed when restricting the attention on sub clusters , i.e. groups of stocks below the cluster level in the hierarchy .",
    "more details about the analysis on sub clusters is reported in the sm .",
    "we also report in the sm a bootstrap study which retains only the stocks whose hierarchical order is validated after resampling with replacement the empirical time series .",
    "we find that the most robust hierarchical orders show even neater correlation with the corresponding multifractality indicators and this further analysis helps reinforcing the significance of the trends shown in figure [ figfinind ] .",
    "although in all cases shown multifractality is found to depend on the hierarchical order , this dependence is likely to be non - linear .",
    "let us consider for example the stocks in cluster @xmath33 : the trend is clearly increasing for @xmath34 $ ] , then there is some oscillation around somewhat less than the value of multifractality attained for @xmath21 similarly to what observed on the complete set of stocks in figure [ figallstocks ] .",
    "the correlation between multifractality and hierarchical order has been also detected dynamically in time .",
    "we have performed dbht clustering in time on 50 overlapping time windows of length @xmath35 days .",
    "the hierarchical structure evolves significantly in time revealing time varying topological properties of the dendrograms .",
    "in particular we tracked the number of clusters @xmath36 observed on the time window @xmath37 .",
    "this gives a measure of how compact the hierarchy is : a large number of clusters corresponds to a hierarchy sprawled horizontally , while a small number of clusters corresponds to a hierarchical tree narrow and deep and therefore compact .",
    "the observed behaviour of @xmath36 is reported in the left plot in figure [ figgammat ] .",
    "we observed a systematic decrease of @xmath36 with time , with the trend being steeper in the period preceding the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis .",
    "hence , the overall contraction of the market already reported in other studies @xcite corresponds to a contraction of the hierarchy , which reflects the fact that the market tends to show less heterogeneity in correlations .",
    "note that to the shrinkage of the hierarchical structure corresponds an increase of the average correlation @xmath38 in the market , as shown in the right plot in figure [ figgammat ] .",

    "the error bars are the standard mean error on the mean @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the standard deviation.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the increase in multifractality can be explained through the exposure of the prices to a larger set of risks , which seem to be well captured by the increase in the average hierarchical order .",
    "the observed trends strongly suggest a deep interplay between the cross dependence patterns of the market and the multifractal properties of the stock prices .",
    "a natural interpretation is then to consider the hierarchical order as the number of different risks affecting each stock together with all other stocks sharing the same hierarchical structure .",
    "these observations give in fact a new insight into the mechanism responsible for the heterogeneity of multifractality in stock prices . backed up by numerous empirical studies which have confirmed the prominent role of the fat tailed nature of the distribution of returns as the main source of observed multifractality @xcite , the observations presented here point in the direction of a mechanism of price formation where the _ measured _ multifractal behaviour emerges from the collective action of many different risks , which are in turn captured in the market hierarchical structure .",
    "the combined action of many risks has the effect of swelling the tails of the returns distribution , triggering an increase in the measured degree of multifractality @xcite .      in order to explain the mechanism underlying the observed link between multifractality and correlation hierarchy we introduce a dynamical hierarchical model ( dhm ) , whose main novelty with respect to standard multivariate models @xcite lies in the introduction of a perturbation term on the correlation matrix associated to its hierarchical structure .",
    "we model returns of stock @xmath3 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a stationary multivariate gaussian random variable , i.e. @xmath44 with @xmath45 the covariance matrix and @xmath46 is a volatility factor . differently from usual multivariate models , @xmath46 is not common to all stocks but depends explicitly on the hierarchical structure of the market .",
    "we suppose there is a volatility factor @xmath47 common to all stocks and then a latent hierarchical structure of risks @xmath48 with @xmath49 , associated with the nodes of the dendrogram . the process @xmath47 is chosen as a stationary log - normal stochastic process autocorrelated in time , with the autocovariance function decaying as a power law , i.e. @xmath50 , in line with a sweeping amount of studies on multi fractals in finance @xcite . for the arbitrary stock @xmath3 with hierarchical path @xmath51",
    "we define the volatility factor as @xmath52 where @xmath53 are bernoulli random variables with probabilities @xmath54 associated to the nodes @xmath48 along the hierarchical tree @xmath5 .",
    "returns therefore take the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "it is worth remarking that the hierarchical term @xmath57 introduces a richer structure of dependence , where the topology of the risk organisation plays a crucial role in creating heterogeneous dependence that can not be accounted for by standard multivariate models .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath58 of this model has entries @xmath59 , where ( see sm for proof ) @xmath60 in the last equation @xmath61 denotes the set of probabilities involved in the relevant dendrogram , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is therefore factorized into two contributions : the correlation coefficient of the multivariate random vector @xmath65 and the hierarchical factor @xmath66 .",
    "although the expression of the perturbation factor @xmath66 may look rather daunting , it has a very simple interpretation . in both limit cases",
    "where the probabilities associated with the risks are all zero or all one , one has @xmath67 , which corresponds to the hierarchy effect being turned off . for all other possible values of the probabilities one has @xmath68 .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath64 is therefore shrunk by a highly diversified hierarchical structure but increases when the hierarchy coalesces , which is exactly what has been observed empirically and reported in figure [ figgammat ] .",
    "note that both cases @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath70 correspond to the absence of a diversified hierarchical structure : in the first case indeed all nodes are switched off , leaving only the common factor to contribute to the volatility , in the second case all risks are active with probability one and thus there is no diversification in the hierarchical configurations of each stock .",
    "we show in the left plot in figure [ figdistrho ] the distribution of measured correlations on a multivariate synthetic dhm with probabilities @xmath72 uniformly distributed in the range @xmath73 $ ] compared to a multivariate log - normal model , which is recovered from the dhm when all @xmath54 s are one .",
    "one can see how the distribution in the case of @xmath74 is more skewed to the left .",
    "increasing the values of the probabilities progressively shifts the median to the right ( see sm ) .",
    "the limit @xmath75 corresponds to the case where the market is dominated by one single risk and the multi - branched hierarchical structure disappears .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the single factor log - normal volatility multivariate model , to which the dhm reduces when the correlation increases .",
    "the conjecture of this underlying hierarchical structure becomes even more appealing on account of a recent study @xcite about the inadequacy of elliptical distributions to describe the stock returns dependency structure .",
    "the authors have shown that the single factor volatility seems to work quite well when the correlation coefficient between two stocks is large , but performs poorly for small correlations .",
    "their observations fit well in the framework of our model , where the hierarchical factor is needed to explain small correlation .",

    "further to the time varying correlation patterns , the dhm is also capable of reproducing the observed correlation between hierarchical order and multifractality .",

    "this main empirical result has been also verified on a dataset from a different western market while it is less evident in markets showing very large hubs of correlated stocks ( see example of the japanese and hong kong market in sm ) .",
    "we have also shown that to the contraction of the market typically unfolding before a financial crisis corresponds a shrinkage of the hierarchical structure and an average increase of multifractality .",
    "starting from these observations we have proposed a model which incorporates explicitly a time varying hierarchical structure of risks into the volatility factor .",

    "the latter is recovered in the limit of no hierarchy of risks , which corresponds to a very compact market where one single risk is enough to explain all correlations .",
