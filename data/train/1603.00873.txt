    "when a star comes within a supermassive black hole s ( smbh ) tidal radius @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the stellar radius and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the black hole and stellar masses , respectively , the tidal shear due to the hole overcomes the self - gravity of the star .",
    "the tidal force subsequently tears the star apart , with half of the torn stellar debris bound to the black hole , the other half unbound @xcite .    these tidal disruption events ( tdes )",
    "have been studied analytically , numerically , and observationally for nearly forty years .",
    "the earliest analytic studies showed that the rate of return of the bound material , @xmath4 , should scale roughly as @xmath5 at late times @xcite , and early numerical simulations supported this scaling @xcite .",
    "dozens of putative tdes have now been discovered ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite for a review of the observational status of tdes ) , and the rates at which they have been discovered show tentative agreement with early estimates of the rate at which they should occur ( @xmath6 per galaxy per year ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recently demonstrated numerically that the streams of tidally - stripped debris were gravitationally unstable when the adiabatic index of the gas was set to @xmath7 , resulting in their fragmentation into bound clumps .",
    "these clumps , when accreted at discrete times , caused the late - time fallback rate to fluctuate about the @xmath8 average ( the minima being induced by the accretion of lower - density material in between clumps ) .",
    "@xcite then performed a more comprehensive numerical study of tdes in which the pericenter distance was comparable to the tidal radius , varying the polytropic index of the gas .",
    "they found that , for stiffer equations of state ( @xmath9 ) , collapse was induced sooner and was enhanced by a `` post - periapsis pancake '' that takes place soon after the disruption .",
    "here we construct a model of the stream of debris produced from a tde in an attempt to characterize its general properties .",
    "we first demonstrate the existence of a simple , self - similar solution for the radial velocity profile along the stream in section 2 , and we compare it to the results of past simulations and use it to determine the stream position as a function of radial distance and time . in section 3",
    "we show how the stream width varies with density and radial position .",
    "section 4 provides approximate , analytic solutions for the density along the stream and we compare these expressions to numerically - computed values .",
    "we analyze the rough scaling of the density with time in section 5 , and we also demonstrate that there is a critical adiabatic index that varies as a function of position along the stream and time at which the stream fragments . it is shown that , for an isentropic equation of state , the critical adiabatic index is equal to @xmath10 for the initial evolution of the stream , but at late times falls to as low as @xmath11 for the unbound portion of the stream .",
    "section 6 provides a discussion of our findings and considers the results of including other effects in our analytic treatment , and we summarize and conclude in section 7 .",
    "as was noted in @xcite , assuming that the tidal disruption takes place impulsively accurately approximates the radial positions of the gas parcels from a tde when the impact parameter of the star is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the pericenter distance of the star .",
    "this impulse approximation states that the star is able to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium until it reaches the tidal radius , at which point it is  destroyed , \" meaning that the self - gravity and pressure of the resultant gas become negligible at this location and for any moment in time thereafter .",
    "therefore , each gas parcel of the tidally - stripped debris moves solely under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "when one applies the impulse approximation to the smbhs we are considering here , the orbital eccentricities of the stream occupy a very narrow range of values centered around one .",
    "therefore , the velocity along the stream is very nearly radial for times not long after disruption .",
    "furthermore , as was also demonstrated in @xcite , the self - gravity of the stream keeps it narrowly confined in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions . as a first approximation we can thus let @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the velocity vector of the material in the stream and @xmath18 is the unit vector in the radial direction pointing away from the smbh .",
    "if we further neglect the influence of pressure gradients and self - gravity in the @xmath19-momentum equation , both of which should be small in comparison to the gravitational field exerted by the hole , then the radial component of the momentum equation is    @xmath20    where @xmath2 is the mass of the smbh .",
    "as we noted above , the eccentricities of the orbits are very nearly one for the entire stream .",
    "furthermore , the relevant timescale at any given distance @xmath19 from the hole is set by the local dynamical time , @xmath21 , so a reasonable assumption for the radial velocity is that it varies self - similarly according to    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    is time normalized to the dynamical time at radius @xmath19 .",
    "if we insert this ansatz into equation , we find the following self - similar equation to be solved for @xmath24 :    @xmath25    where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to this equation , one must also impose a boundary condition on @xmath24 in order to obtain the full solution for the velocity profile .",
    "to do so , recall that the specific energies of the stream are narrowly distributed about zero and are    @xmath27    which shows that @xmath24 is narrowly confined to 1 initially .",
    "investigating equation , the location at which @xmath28 will correspond to @xmath29 if @xmath30 ; however , if @xmath29 , then it is easy to see by taking more derivatives of equation that every higher derivative of @xmath24 is also zero , i.e. , @xmath31 is the solution if @xmath32 when @xmath28 .",
    "since we we require the energies of the gas parcels to be distributed about , but not exactly equal to , zero , we see that the point @xmath28 must coincide with @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , our boundary condition on @xmath24 is @xmath34 , which we note corresponds to a critical point in equation .. ]     ( blue , solid curve ) .",
    "the approximate solution given by @xmath35 , which matches the asymptotic limits of the true solution , is shown by the red , dashed , curve .",
    ", width=326 ]    in further support of the fact that @xmath34 is the only boundary condition that can describe the debris stream , we note that equation can be integrated exactly to give    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is a constant of integration .",
    "this equation can not be solved analytically to isolate @xmath38 ; however , if we set @xmath28 , the left - hand side of this equation is singular _ unless _ @xmath39 .",
    "the only solution for @xmath40 that smoothly passes through marginally - bound portion of the stream must therefore have @xmath41 . if we adopt this value of @xmath37 and use lhospital s rule to determine the limit of @xmath42 , we find , as we expect , that @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ fig : fexapp ] shows this critical solution by the blue , solid curve .",
    "for contrast , the red , dashed curve shows the approximate solution @xmath44 , which aids in seeing the asymptotic behavior of the true function .",

    "a solar - type star ( one with a solar mass and solar radius ) was destroyed by a @xmath46 smbh using the smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code @xcite with @xmath47 particles ; the pericenter distance of the stellar progenitor was equal to the tidal radius , the gas followed an adiabatic , @xmath7 equation of state , and pressure and self - gravity were included at all stages of the simulation ( we refer the interested reader to @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the different curves in figure [ fig : vcomps ] correspond to the stream of debris at different times , with the earliest ( farthest left on the plot ) being roughly two weeks after disruption , the latest ( occupying the largest radial extent ) at almost two years ( the figure caption gives the precise times ) .",

    "each set of points corresponds to the time chosen in figure [ fig : vcomps ] .",
    "the small differences illustrated by this plot may be due to the neglect of angular momentum in the self - similar solution ( see section 6.1 ) .",
    "with the function @xmath24 completely determined , the radial positions of the gas parcels comprising the stream can be found by solving the differential equation    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the radial position of gas parcel @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the self - similar variable of gas parcel @xmath54 , and dots denote differentiation with respect to time .    because @xmath24 is not analytic , this equation can not be integrated exactly to give @xmath53 .",
    "however , we note that there is an exact solution for the marginally - bound material :    @xmath56    as a check , differentiating this equation with respect to time gives @xmath57 , which , from equation , demands @xmath58 . on the other hand , @xmath59 , and",
    "since our boundary condition is @xmath34 , we see that equation does indeed solve equation .    to determine the remaining positions of the gas parcels",
    ", we will apply an argument similar to the impulse approximation : at some time @xmath60 , the stream is closely confined to the position of the marginally - bound segment of the stream , with its radial extent equal to the diameter of the disrupted star .",
    "we will thus let    @xmath61    where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , we know that the tidal force of the black hole imparts a spread of energies to the debris of @xcite    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the dimensionless distance of gas parcel @xmath54 from the center of mass of the star at the time of disruption . however , from equation we have that the energies of the gas parcels at time @xmath60 are    @xmath66    where the entire right - hand side is evaluated at @xmath60 , and since the stream is narrowly confined to the position of the marginally - bound parcel , we have    @xmath67    this equation is just a taylor expansion of @xmath24 about the point @xmath33 , and we used the fact that @xmath68 ( see footnote above ) .",
    "we therefore have that    @xmath69    and using equations and and keeping only first order terms in @xmath70 , we find that the positions of the gas parcels satisfy    @xmath71    setting @xmath72 , we see that the time at which the energies are  frozen in \" corresponds to @xmath73 in the self - similar approximation .",
    "this shows that , if we adopt our self - similar function for the velocities , we can not impose the impulse approximation exactly , which would amount to setting the center of the star at @xmath74 at @xmath75 with the radial extent of the stream equal to @xmath76 .",
    "this occurs because , by specifying the positions of the gas parcels at some time @xmath77 , we automatically know their velocities via equation and , consequently , their energies .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that the energies will automatically correspond to the correct values ( equation [ eps ] ) by enforcing @xmath78 , and indeed we see that we must have @xmath79 to correctly match the energies .    with the initial conditions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath60 given by equation with @xmath73",
    ", we can numerically integrate equation to solve for the positions of the gas parcels as a function of time .",
    "however , we can obtain an approximate expression for the initial evolution of the debris stream by letting    @xmath82    where we have let @xmath83 become a continuous variable and @xmath84 is a small correction ( on the order of @xmath85 ) to the marginally - bound orbit @xmath86 ( note that this is just a taylor expansion of @xmath87 about @xmath88 , truncated at first order ) .",
    "if we now insert equation into equation , use equation for the function @xmath24 , and keep only terms to first order in @xmath89 , performing a bit of algebra reveals that    @xmath90    this shows that the correction to the positions of the material from the marginally - bound orbit , during the initial evolution of the debris stream , scales as @xmath91 . using this expression for @xmath84 in equation , this also shows that    @xmath92    note that this result is exact , as all of the higher - order @xmath88 corrections are zero at @xmath93 . we will use this result in section 3.2",
    ".    finally , while equation is useful for the early evolution of the debris , it breaks down once the orbits of the material start to deviate from @xmath94 .",
    "we can obtain an approximate expression for the positions of the gas parcels , one that is roughly valid over the whole stream , by recalling that the function @xmath24 is reasonably well - approximated by the function    @xmath95    as depicted in figure [ fig : fexapp ] .",
    "if we use this approximate form for @xmath24 , then we can show that equation can be solved for @xmath53 to give    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is a constant of integration particular to gas parcel @xmath54 .",
    "we can determine these constants by , as above , requiring that the length of the stream is narrowly confined , initially , about the marginally - bound position , i.e. , @xmath98 , with @xmath72 .",
    "doing so gives    @xmath99    unfortunately , the value of @xmath100 can not be determined by requiring that the energies match those from the impulse approximation ; this is because the marginally - bound orbit from equation  where @xmath101  occurs at @xmath102 , while from equations and it occurs where @xmath103 .",
    "this discrepancy means that the energies do not correlate with the properties of the orbits , and arises ultimately from the fact that the boundary condition @xmath34 is not satisfied by equation .",
    "therefore , in this case we will simply let @xmath73  the same value found above when the correct form of @xmath24 is used  and note that the positions of the gas parcels from equation will differ from the true values because of the erroneous energies .",
    "we thus find that the approximate positions of the gas parcels are    @xmath104    where we defined    @xmath105",
    "the previous section exploited the fact that , to a very good approximation , the radial positions of the gas parcels can be found by considering them as non - interacting test particles in the gravitational field of the hole ; this notion is substantiated by figure [ fig : vcomps ] . however , this will not necessarily be the case for the transverse structure of the stream , as self - gravity and pressure can be important at both early and late times @xcite .",
    "if we account for self - gravity and pressure , the transverse momentum equation becomes    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the cylindrical distance from the stream center , @xmath108 is the velocity in the @xmath107-direction , @xmath109 is the force due to self - gravity in the @xmath107 direction , and @xmath110 is the gravitational force arising from the black hole in the @xmath107-direction .",
    "poisson s equation can be written    @xmath111    if we assume that the radial dependence of @xmath109 is small in comparison with its @xmath107-dependence , which should be a good approximation owing to the degree of symmetry of the stream about its center of mass and breaks down only near its radial extremities , then this equation can be integrated using gauss law to give    @xmath112    the perpendicular component of the gravitational field of the hole can also be written down as    @xmath113    substituting these equations into equation then gives    @xmath114      during the early evolution of the debris , the pressure and self - gravity of the material are high enough that the stream remains approximately in gravitational equilibrium in the transverse direction ( approximately because the density is evolving with time and the planar motions can cause the stream to be slightly over - pressured , resulting in oscillations ; @xcite ) . in this limit",
    "we can balance the pressure and self - gravity terms in equation , which gives    @xmath115    here we will assume that the pressure varies as    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is related to the entropy of the gas .",
    "a perfect polytrope is obtained by setting @xmath117 to a constant ; however , the stream of debris will cool radiatively as it evolves , and will do so increasingly as the material becomes optically thin to the radiation released during recombinations . also , recombinations can heat the gas when it is still optically thick @xcite , and shocks can likewise serve to heat the material if the star is on a deeply - plunging orbit . to model these thermodynamic aspects of the problem , we will therefore permit @xmath117 to be a function of @xmath19 and @xmath118 that could , in principle , be determined from the gas energy equation if all of the effects controlling the internal energy of the gas were known .",
    "the equilibrium width is thus    @xmath119    which is the same scaling found by @xcite .",
    "depending on the adiabatic index of the gas or the amount of heating and cooling , the density will fall off at such a rate that the tidal shear term on the right - hand side of equation will overcome the self - gravity @xcite .",
    "the pressure gradient will also be insufficient to balance the tidal compression when this happens , meaning that the advective terms on the left - hand side of equation must become non - negligible . in this limit equation",
    "becomes    @xmath120    we expect that the solution for @xmath108 will again scale self - similarly , as the dynamical time is the only relevant timescale and only the gravitational field of the hole serves to alter the velocity @xmath108 .",
    "we find that indeed there is a self - similar solution , and it is given by    @xmath121    where @xmath38 is the same function that appears in the distribution of the radial velocity . since @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the transverse position of gas parcel @xmath54 , and @xmath124 , we find that the transverse extent of the stream evolves as    @xmath125    where @xmath126 is the width of the stream at time @xmath77 .",
    "when the stream is dominated by the tidal shear of the hole , this equation shows that the width of the stream simply scales in proportion to its radial position and the entire evolution proceeds self - similarly .",
    "the above two restricted solutions demonstrate that , when the self - gravity of the stream dominates over the tidal shear of the black hole , the width of the stream is set by hydrostatic balance . on the other hand , when the tidal force of the black hole overwhelms self - gravity , @xmath127 and the entire stream evolves self - similarly .    along the full radial extent of the debris",
    ", the extremities will typically be shear - dominated , while the density in the central region is high enough to dominate over the shear of the hole @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect the scaling of @xmath128 to vary between the self - gravity - dominated limit and the shear - dominated limit as we traverse the extent of the stream . in between those two limits , both the shear terms and",
    "the self - gravity terms are important in equation , and as a result we do not expect a simple solution for the velocity @xmath108 .",
    "we can , however , obtain an approximate solution that interpolates between the self - gravity and shear - dominated extremes by simply letting @xmath128 be piecewise defined about the point where @xmath129 .",
    "we thus have    @xmath130    to ensure the continuity of the solution , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are given by the self - gravitating solution where @xmath129 . in the next section",
    "we will see how @xmath133 is related to @xmath128 .",
    "in addition to knowing the geometry of the stream , we would also like to be able to infer its density . to do so",
    ", we note that the mass contained in some segment of the stream is    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the volume of the stream segment that is , in general , time - dependent .",
    "the total mass contained in the segment is , however , time - independent , so the differential equation to be solved for @xmath133 is    @xmath136    when the limits of integration in this equation are functions of time , using the fundamental theorem of calculus results in the continuity equation .",
    "however , if we can transform to a specific set of coordinates in which the volume element is time-_independent _ , then the resulting equation can be immediately inverted to solve for @xmath133 .",
    "in particular , if we write the new set of coordinates collectively as @xmath137 , then the equation for @xmath133 is simply    @xmath138    where @xmath139 is the jacobian of the transformation between the physical ( @xmath140 ) and time - independent ( @xmath137 ) coordinates . here",
    "@xmath141 is the differential amount of mass contained in the volume element @xmath142 .",
    "we can achieve the transformation @xmath143 by choosing our physical coordinates as @xmath144 , where @xmath19 is the radial position of the center of the stream , @xmath107 is cylindrical distance measured perpendicular from @xmath19 , and @xmath145 is the angle swept out by @xmath107 as it revolves around @xmath19 . in terms of these coordinates , the mass contained in any segment of the stream is    @xmath146    if we further define the @xmath128-averaged density as    @xmath147    then the mass is given by    @xmath148    where we dropped the bar for ease of notation . by now transforming from @xmath149 , where @xmath88 is the dimensionless original position of the stream , we find",
    "( see also equation 2 of @xcite )    @xmath150    in order to make more progress with this equation , we must determine the quantities @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . as we saw in the previous section ,",
    "@xmath128 depends on @xmath133 and @xmath19 in a non - trivial way , and will behave differently depending on whether the stream is shear dominated or self - gravity dominated .",
    "however , we noted that a full , approximate solution can be obtained by assuming that @xmath128 switches between its hydrostatic equilibrium value and self - similar expansion at the point where @xmath129 , which gives equation for @xmath128 .    the most rigorous way of calculating @xmath152 is to do so numerically , i.e. , calculate the positions of the gas parcels comprising the stream , @xmath87 , via equation for a large number of @xmath88 and @xmath118 , and at a specific time @xmath118 interpolate over all of the @xmath88 to determine @xmath154 .",
    "however , we can also use equation , which gives an approximate solution for the positions of the gas parcels as functions of @xmath88 and @xmath118 , to obtain an analytic expression .",
    "doing so gives    @xmath155    which we note is approximately valid over the entire extent of the stream ( this expression , however , gives @xmath156 , in contrast to the exact value of @xmath157 ) .",
    "finally , the function @xmath158 can be determined by using the impulse approximation and considering the star at the time of disruption .",
    "this assumption then gives ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for details )    @xmath159    where @xmath160 is the solution to the lane - emden equation and @xmath26 is the dimensionless radius of the polytrope @xcite .",
    "a slight difficulty arises from the fact that , if the energies of the gas parcels using our self - similar prescription are to match those from the true impulse approximation ( the one that accounts for the finite angular momentum of the material ) , then the `` time of disruption ''  the point at which the energies are frozen in  corresponds to when the marginally - bound segment of the stream is at a distance of @xmath73 , not at @xmath74 ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "this means that using equation with the self - similar solution will overestimate the density , as we expect that the stream will have stretched by some factor by the time it reaches the distance @xmath161 and correspondingly decreased the density .    since the functions @xmath160 are only analytic for a select few values of @xmath162 , equation can not , in general , be simplified further .",
    "however , we can obtain an approximate solution by letting @xmath163 , which is valid in the inner regions of all polytropes .",
    "we can therefore write    @xmath164    because @xmath128 switches between its equilibrium value and self - similar expansion along the length of the stream , equation , even with the approximate , analytic expressions for @xmath152 and @xmath158 , can not be rearranged to write @xmath133 in closed - form over the entire extent of the stream . however , in the limit that self - gravity or the tidal shear dominates , we can solve the equation exactly .",
    "inserting equations and into equation and inverting the function to solve for @xmath165 , we find that these limits correspond to    @xmath166    @xmath167    where @xmath168 and @xmath169 refer to the density in the self - gravity and shear - dominated cases , respectively , and for compactness we defined    @xmath170    and    @xmath171    for the shear - dominated solution , we let @xmath172 when @xmath173 , which is consistent with the impulse approximation under our self - similar prescription as we saw in section 2.2 .",

    "interestingly , the density profile of the simulation in @xcite does not exhibit this up - turn in the density as the material approaches the black hole .",
    "this anomalous behavior is demonstrated by the red points in figure [ fig : rhocomps_particles ] , which is a particle plot of density versus @xmath19 from the simulation in @xcite .",
    "the black points in this figure , on the other hand , are from a simulation that is identical to that from @xcite except that , instead of @xmath47 particles , @xmath186 sph particles were used .",
    "the green , dashed line shows the curve @xmath182 .",
    "the fact that the black points show the upturn in the density as we approach the black hole , consistent with what we expect from the analytic arguments presented here , shows that the disagreement between the simulation in @xcite and our predictions arises from the resolution of the simulation .",
    "since the increase in the density arises from the tidal compression exerted by the black hole , which results from the differential gravitational force acting across the diameter of the stream , we see that the width of the incoming debris stream is underresolved when only @xmath47 particles are used .",
    "the most accurate way of determining how the density of the stellar debris stream produced from a tde varies with @xmath19 and @xmath118 is to solve equation numerically .",
    "however , this direct way does nt yield an obvious trend for how the density roughly scales with distance and time . even from equations and , which give approximate expressions for @xmath133 in the self - gravity and shear - dominated limits , respectively , it is not overly apparent how the density qualitatively behaves as the stream recedes from the black hole .",
    "we can , however , discern how certain _ parts _ of the stream behave by returning to equation and focusing only on certain energy , or @xmath88 , ranges .",
    "recall that the marginally - bound segment of the stream corresponds to @xmath93 , follows @xmath101 , and , from section 2.2 , satisfies @xmath187 .",
    "returning to equation , we thus find    @xmath188    where @xmath189 refers to the density at the marginally - bound part of the stream .",
    "if we now assume that the stream is self - gravity dominated , then using equation for @xmath128 shows    @xmath190    if the gas is isentropic , then , for adiabatic indices of @xmath191 5/3 , 1.8 , and 2 , we find that @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath8 , and @xmath194 , respectively , which is in good agreement with the scalings found by @xcite .",
    "equation holds when the self - gravity of the debris dominates over the tidal field of the hole ; however , if the density of the debris falls off at a rate steeper than @xmath193 , then even if it starts out as being self - gravitating , the tidal shear of the black hole will eventually dominate the self - gravity of the debris .",
    "as we saw above , the critical @xmath195 at which self - gravity and the tidal field of the hole balance one another at the marginally - bound portion of the stream , which we will denote @xmath196 , is given by    @xmath197    when the tidal shear dominates the self - gravity of the stream , the ability of the debris to collapse locally and fragment is seriously hindered .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath196 to represent the critical adiabatic index at which fragmentation is marginally possible : for @xmath198 , the stream can fragment , while for @xmath199 , the stream is stable to fragmentation .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the results of @xcite , who found that the stream fragmented vigorously for @xmath200 and 2 , fragmented at late times and due to numerical noise for @xmath7 , and did not exhibit any fragmentation for @xmath201 ( see also section 6 for a further discussion of this point ) .",
    "when the tidal shear of the black hole overwhelms the stream self - gravity , then using the fact that @xmath202 shows that the isentropic density scales as    @xmath203    this demonstrates that the density of the stream will not necessarily fall off as a single power - law throughout its entire evolution .",
    "for example , if the stream starts out self - gravitating and has an adiabatic index of @xmath201 , then it will initially follow @xmath204 before eventually transitioning to the shallower power - law @xmath205 .",
    "if we let the entropy scale as @xmath206 , which provides some insight into the ability of heating and cooling to affect the evolution of the stream density , then it is simple to show that the critical adiabatic index along the marginally - bound portion of the stream becomes    @xmath207    this illustrates that cooling does not need to be very efficient to significantly alter the fragmentation properties of the stream . alternatively ,",
    "if shocks play a significant role in heating the gas , then the ability of the stream to fragment will be correspondingly diminished . on the other hand ,",
    "once the gas temperature drops to about @xmath208k , the gas can start to recombine and heat the debris , stalling its temperature at @xmath208k and resulting in an adiabatic index of order unity .",
    "however , once the neutral fraction becomes significant , the optical depth decreases dramatically and recombinations will serve to cool the gas , corresponding to a larger effective @xmath195 @xcite .      for the material in the unbound portion of the stream , the gas parcels follow @xmath101 initially , but eventually transition to @xmath209 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath210 when the material recedes to large distances from the hole , and we find that equation becomes    @xmath211    where @xmath212 refers to the density in the unbound portion of the stream .",
    "if we now focus on the self - gravity dominated limit , using equation shows    @xmath213    from this expression we see that the density of the unbound material falls off at a _ shallower _ rate than the marginally - bound debris .",
    "specifically , for @xmath7 we find @xmath214 as compared to @xmath215 .",
    "furthermore , since the density of the black hole falls off as @xmath216 for the unbound debris as opposed to @xmath217 for the marginally - bound debris , the critical adiabatic index at which the black hole density equals the stream density is correspondingly smaller .",
    "in particular , if we set @xmath218 , we find that the critical adiabatic index in the unbound portion of the stream is @xmath219 .",
    "when the tidal shear of the hole dominates the self - gravity , using equation in equation gives    @xmath220    as was true for the marginally - bound case , this shows that the density of the unbound material will not necessarily fall off as a single power - law throughout its evolution if it passes from being self - gravity to being shear - dominated .",
    "furthermore , because the energies of the debris are greater than zero by only a small amount , the initial evolution of even the unbound debris will still follow approximately @xmath221 , and only at some time @xmath222 will the orbits transition to @xmath223 .",
    "if we rewrite equation as    @xmath224    where the second term in this equation comes from equation with the requirement that @xmath225 , then we see that the time at which this transition occurs is approximately    @xmath226    thus , if the unbound stream is self - gravitating , then at @xmath222 we expect the density to transition from @xmath227 to @xmath228 .",
    "equivalently , if we are following an unbound fluid parcel with a narrow range of specific energies , then we expect the density to transition from @xmath229 to @xmath230 at this time . for the disruption of a solar - type star by a @xmath46 smbh , this time corresponds to @xmath231 days post - disruption .",
    "the above two subsections show that the marginally - bound and unbound material behave quite differently in terms of their asymptotic scalings .",
    "as was true for the unbound material , the initial evolution of the bound material will follow approximately @xmath232 because the specific energies , while being negative , are very close to zero .",
    "since the bound material inevitably falls back to the origin no matter how close the energy is to zero , though , there is unfortunately no simple way of discerning the asymptotic behavior of this segment of the stream .",
    "one quantity that gives some insight into its behavior , however , is the number @xmath233 as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "when taking this logarithmic derivative , the quantities @xmath133 and @xmath19 are considered functions of @xmath88 and @xmath118 and @xmath88 is a constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath234 gives the power - law index of the ratio of the density along the stream relative to the density associated with the black hole tidal field as a function of time and as we move along with a fluid element .",
    "figure [ fig : qofmu ] shows a plot of @xmath235 for @xmath7 and the disruption of a solar - type star by a @xmath46 smbh ( @xmath236 was set to a constant ) .",
    "the left - hand panel gives the solution when the flow is dominated by self - gravity , while the right - hand panel shows the case when the flow is shear dominated .",
    "the different curves give different times since disruption , with the blue curve at @xmath237 days after disruption , the brown curve at @xmath238 days after disruption , and each curve differing from the next closest curve by @xmath239 days .",
    "as we mentioned , the quantity @xmath234 characterizes the instantaneous power law of the product @xmath240 , i.e. , the ratio of the density in the stream to that of the black hole scales instantaneously as @xmath241 .",
    "these plots show us what to expect when we consider lines of constant @xmath88  when we follow along a single fluid element .",
    "when @xmath242 , the specific energy of the gas parcel is greater than zero , and thus initially follow @xmath101 but eventually transition to @xmath243 for late times . we would thus expect that , at early times , the ratio of the density of the stream to that of the black hole should follow @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) for self - gravity dominated ( shear dominated ) streams , while at late times it should follow @xmath246 ( @xmath247 ) for self - gravity dominated ( shear dominated ) streams .",
    "this behavior is exactly shown in the left and right - hand panels of figure [ fig : qofmu ] , and specifically the rate at which this transition occurs .",
    "likewise , if the material is _ exactly _ at @xmath93 , it will always follow @xmath248 ( @xmath249 ) for self - gravity ( shear)-dominated streams , and this is seen in the figure .",
    "figure [ fig : qofmu ] also shows how the density of the bound material , fluid elements with @xmath250 , evolves with respect to the density of the smbh .",
    "as we mentioned , there is no asymptotic behavior for the bound material because it inevitably falls back to the black hole .",
    "however , we see that the ratio of the stream density to the black hole density always scales as some power of @xmath118 that is less than 1 , and in fact this power - law decreases as time increases .",
    "we thus expect that all material bound to the black hole , if it follows a @xmath7 equation of state , will eventually become shear - dominated .",
    "in the preceding sections we developed pseudo - analytical expressions for the velocity profile of the debris , the positions of the gas parcels comprising the debris stream , and the density of the debris stream . here we discuss how the angular momentum of the debris might alter these expressions , make comparisons to the previous work of @xcite on tidally - disrupted debris streams , consider the fate of the debris that satisfies the critical adiabatic index condition , and explore how the entropy of the gas should realistically behave .",
    "the solutions we have given here rely on the fact that the angular momentum of the material is small enough to be ignored when considering the evolution of the debris stream .",
    "since the @xmath14-component of the velocity is approximately given by @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the specific angular momentum of the material and @xmath253 is the pericenter distance of the star , we find that @xmath254 .",
    "thus , the neglect of angular momentum only breaks down for small radii , and should be increasingly accurate as the pericenter distance of the progenitor gets smaller .",
    "this argument also agrees with figure [ fig : deltavplots ] , which shows that the agreement between the self - similar solution and the numerical solution gets better as we proceed to larger distances from the hole ( and , as a consequence , the ratio of the angular velocity to the radial velocity gets smaller ) .",
    "one consequence of accounting for the finite angular momentum of the material is that the position of the center of the stream ( in terms of its width ) is not purely radial , but instead sweeps out some angle ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the extent of the stream is not exactly @xmath255 , but is instead given by    @xmath256    where @xmath14 is the in - plane angular position of the center of the stream ; this is the equation employed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , the overall length of the stream is slightly underestimated by ignoring the angular momentum of the gas .",
    "a more important consequence of the angular momentum of the material is that the orientation of the tidal force of the smbh will change as the bound material returns to the origin .",
    "specifically , by assuming that the motion of the gas parcels was radial with a transverse extent @xmath107 , the tidal field of the hole only served to compress material in the transverse direction ( viz .",
    "equation [ bhshear ] ) and increase the density of the stream .",
    "however , once the orientation of the cross - sectional width of the stream @xmath128 rotates to the point where it is aligned with the radial displacement of the center of the stream , the tidal compression will transition to a tidal shear that results in a decrease of the density .",
    "figure [ fig : tidal_compression ] shows a rough drawing , not to scale , of the cross - section of the returning debris stream that illustrates this point : the left side shows the current assumption about the nature of @xmath128 versus the position of the center of the stream , while the right side gives a more accurate picture that accounts for the finite angular momentum of the material . from this schematic",
    "we see that , under the current , radial approximation for the position of the center of the stream ( in terms of the transverse width ) , the tidal field of the black hole will only compress the stream and consequently enhance the density near the black hole .",
    "in actuality , however , the small amount of angular momentum possessed by the debris causes it to miss the black hole , changing the tidal compression of the hole into a tidal shear that actually decreases the density .",
    "@xcite also performed an analysis of the debris streams produced from tdes , in an attempt to discern the nature of the self - intersection that ensues when the bound material is swung through its general relativistic apsidal precession angle ( roughly ten degrees for a solar - like star disrupted by a @xmath45 smbh ; @xcite ) . here",
    "we make a brief comparison between his findings and ours .",
    "one important result of @xcite was that , if the impact parameter @xmath257 , where @xmath13 is the pericenter distance of the center of mass of the progenitor star , is large enough , then self - gravity will not be important for determining the evolution of the stream .",
    "here we find a similar trend : from figure [ fig : qofmu ] , shear - dominated streams always follow @xmath258 with @xmath259 . thus ,",
    "if the impact parameter is high enough such that the density everywhere satisfies @xmath260 , then the stream density will never be able to surmount the tidal shear of the smbh ( although the unbound material does asymptotically follow @xmath261 ) .",
    "@xcite also found that the width of the stream varies as @xmath262 for a @xmath7 equation of state .",
    "this result ultimately comes from the fact that the mass per unit length @xmath263 is assumed to be @xmath264 ( see also @xcite for the expression when general @xmath195 are used alongside this prescription ) .",
    "however , we found from our analysis that the early evolution of the stream  when all of the gas parcels are following approximately @xmath101 orbits",
    " is characterized by    @xmath265    where the last relation follows from the fact that @xmath101 . since @xmath266 , and @xmath267 during this phase ,",

    "the black , solid curve shows the solution from the same simulation performed in @xcite ( i.e. , a solar - like star destroyed by a @xmath45 smbh ) but with @xmath186 particles , while the red , dashed curve shows the analytic prediction @xmath270 ( the constant of proportionality was set to 0.33 ) .",
    ", width=326 ]    figure [ fig : hvsr ] shows @xmath271 at the marginally - bound portion of the stream as a function of @xmath272 , with the solid , black curve from the simulation in @xcite but using @xmath186 particles , and the red , dashed curve from the analytic prediction @xmath270 ( the proportionality constant was set to 0.33 , which provides a good by - eye fit ) .",
    "the width was calculated from the simulation by first determining the number of particles that had specific energies within a small range centered around zero ; for this plot , the absolute value of the maximum energy was @xmath273 ( as compared to the energy of the most energetic particles of @xmath274 ; see equation [ eps ] ) , which amounted to roughly @xmath275 particles and a total mass of @xmath276 contained within the zero - energy bin .",
    "the maximum and minimum radii , @xmath277 and @xmath278 , respectively , within that bin were computed , giving a radial extent @xmath279 of the marginally - bound portion of the stream .",
    "we then calculated the quantity @xmath280 , determined the average density , and used equation to calculate the width .",
    "this figure shows that the analytic prediction of @xmath281 fits the data well .",
    "the disagreement between the prediction and the numerical results at early times is likely because self - gravity is still acting to modify the specific energies in the radial direction .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that the number of particles in the marginally - bound energy bin goes from @xmath282 to @xmath283 during that initial transient phase , after which point it remains almost exactly constant .",
    "once the orbits of the unbound material transition to @xmath243 , which occurs around 50 days for the disruption of a solar - like star by a @xmath45 smbh , we recover the scaling @xmath284 . using the fact that @xmath285 during this phase , the relation @xmath286 yields @xmath262 , which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "@xcite also discussed how ionizations and recombinations , viscosity , and an ambient medium affect the evolution of the debris stream .",
    "we will return to these points in section 6.4 , where we reconsider the entropy of the gas .",
    "when the density of the black hole @xmath287 falls off at a rate that is steeper than the density of the debris stream , we expect that the self - gravity of the stream in the radial direction will eventually overcome the shear of the black hole .",
    "equivalently , if @xmath288 , the dynamical timescale @xmath289 , which is the time over which material is sheared in the radial direction , will be longer than the free - fall timescale @xmath290 .",
    "thus , in this case the material is able to aggregate faster than the rate at which it is being torn apart , and we expect the stream to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "conversely , when @xmath291 falls off more steeply than @xmath292 , the ordering of the timescales reverses , and overdensities are sheared apart faster than they can collapse .",
    "we thus expect the stream to be gravitationally stable when @xmath291 falls off faster than @xmath292 .",
    "these arguments are supported by @xcite , who investigated , from a numerical perspective , how the evolution of the debris stream from a tde depends on the adiabatic index of the gas .",
    "they found that , when @xmath200 and 2 , the stream fragmented early in its evolution ; from our analysis @xmath293 and @xmath194 when @xmath200 and 2 , respectively , and thus we expect the stream to fragment in these cases . on the other hand , @xcite found that the stream never fragmented  even after ten years post - disruption  when the adiabatic index of the gas was 1.5 . from equations and ,",
    "the density should fall off as @xmath294 for @xmath201 , which is significantly steeper than @xmath193 and we therefore expect , consistent with the numerical findings , that the stream is stable to fragmentation in this case .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also ran simulations in which the adiabatic index of the gas was set to @xmath7 . in this case , they found that the stream still fragmented , but the time at which fragmentation occurred depended on the resolution of the simulation .",
    "in particular , if the number of particles was increased , the stream fragmented later and vice versa . this finding then _ suggests _ that the stream is gravitationally unstable , but that the noise inherent in the numerical method is seeding the instability .",
    "is this finding and interpretation consistent with our analysis here ? as we saw above , @xmath7 marks the critical adiabatic index ( for an isentropic equation of state ) where @xmath295 during the early evolution of the debris . in this case , then , the freefall and collapse timescales are proportional to one another , and it is unclear whether or not the stream _ should _ fragment .    to answer this question , we note that a precisely analogous situation is encountered when one considers jeans collapse in the early universe : as primordial overdensities form and try to collapse , they are continuously stretched apart by the fact that the background density scales as @xmath295 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , p.  202 ) . in this case , then , the freefall and dynamical timescales are comparable , and the fate of the overdensities becomes unclear .",
    "however , one can show that there are still growing , unstable modes , but instead of evolving as exponentials they only scale as power - laws in time . to understand the origin of this result",
    ", we can argue somewhat heuristically that the relation    @xmath296    where @xmath297 is the growing mode of the instability and @xmath298 is the free - fall timescale , holds more generally than just when @xmath298 is time - independent ( and , as a consequence , the instability grows exponentially ) .",
    "thus , if we write @xmath299 , where @xmath77 is a characteristic timescale and @xmath300 is a characteristic density , then it follows immediately that @xmath301  the overdensities grow as power - laws .    for a star being disrupted by a smbh ,",
    "the characteristic timescale is the dynamical time at the tidal radius , so @xmath302 , while the characteristic density @xmath300 is the original stellar density .",
    "we thus expect that when @xmath7 , the growing modes should scale roughly as    @xmath303    where @xmath304 is the ratio of the stellar density , @xmath305 , to the density of the smbh at the time of disruption , @xmath306 .",
    "these arguments illustrate that when the density of the stream falls off as @xmath307  which occurs for the early evolution of the marginally - bound material when @xmath308 and @xmath7 , and also occurs for the shear - dominated portion of the unbound stream for any @xmath195  there are growing unstable modes",
    ". a more rigorous approach would be to perform a perturbation analysis on the fluid equations , and when this is done for jeans collapse in the early universe , the results of the heuristic argument are upheld @xcite . since the problem is identical here in terms of the scalings of the variables , it follows that the heuristic argument is also valid , and for completeness we have checked that equation is recovered if one performs a perturbation analysis .",
    "( technically , the result is that @xmath309 , where @xmath310 is a number of order unity . )",
    "we thus find that the results of @xcite and @xcite are consistent with our analytical arguments : when @xmath7 , the stream is unstable to fragmentation .",
    "however , because the dynamical timescale and collapse timescale are proportional in this case , the overdensities grow as power - laws instead of exponentials .",
    "this considerably weaker growth rate means that resolving the instability is much more difficult , and the noise in the density that is induced by the numerical method becomes the dominant contributor to the fluctuations that seed the instability .",
    "however , in the presence of a sufficiently dense ambient medium , the shear between the stream and that medium would provide a physical origin for the perturbations @xcite .    before moving on , we note that the simulations of @xcite and @xcite found that bound portions of the stream , specifically those very close to the marginally - bound orbit , also exhibited fragmentation . based on figure [ fig : qofmu ]",
    ", we would not expect this , as @xmath311 with @xmath234 less than zero for the bound material .",
    "however , our treatment here of the radial velocity ignored the effects of self - gravity in the radial direction ; it can be seen from figure [ fig : rhocomps_particles ] , though , that the denser material towards the marginally bound segment of the stream generates a gravitational force on the bound material that serves to counteract the gravitational pull of the smbh .",
    "this additional force will serve to reduce the amount of shear present within the flow , correspondingly lengthening the dynamical time and conceivably allowing some parts of the bound material to collapse .",
    "most of the examples we considered here assumed that the constant - entropy nature of the polytrope was preserved throughout the evolution of the debris .",
    "however , our equation permits a radially and temporally dependent entropy , which , through equation , would serve to alter the nature of the stream . in particular ,",
    "if the entropy decreases due to cooling , the density is correspondingly increased , making it easier for the stream to overcome the @xmath7 marginally - unstable condition ( equation [ gammacm ] ) ; likewise , if the internal energy of the gas increases , the width of the stream grows and results in the gravitational stability of the stream .",
    "when the stream initially starts to expand , any cooling is initially controlled by the fact that the surface radiates approximately as a blackbody :    @xmath312    where @xmath313 [ cgs ] , @xmath314 is the area of the emitting surface , and @xmath315 is the effective temperature that is , in general , dependent on time and position along the stream .",
    "the assumption of a blackbody is justified by the fact that the optical depth across the width of the stream is    @xmath316    where @xmath317 is the rosseland mean opacity and @xmath318 for solar - like progenitors ( @xmath319 and @xmath320 g / @xmath185 ) .",
    "the stream is therefore very optically thick when the stream is still highly ionized , which justifies the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( but see below for when recombinations start to change the opacity ) .",
    "the area of the stream is simply @xmath321 , @xmath322 being the infinitesimal distance along the stream . since the total amount of internal energy contained in the stream is comparable to the amount contained in the original star , @xmath323 ergs for a solar - like progenitor , any radiation escaping from the photosphere should decrease the internal energy on roughly the kelvin - helmholtz timescale ",
    "thousands to millions of years if the disrupted star is roughly solar .",
    "thus , the early evolution of the debris stream should be very nearly adiabatic .",
    "however , recombinations will start to occur as the temperature of the debris reaches roughly @xmath208 k. as recognized by @xcite and @xcite , this could have important consequences for the evolution of the debris stream , heating the material when it is optically thick and cooling it as it becomes optically thin . if the stream follows",
    "a @xmath7 adiabatic equation of state and is self - gravity dominated , then we can show , by returning to equation , using equations , and , and the ideal gas law , that the temperature evolves as    @xmath324    where the factor of @xmath325 resulted from evaluating equation numerically for n=1.5 ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath93 , @xmath326 g is the mean molecular mass in the stream , @xmath327 [ cgs ] is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath328 h for a solar - like progenitor and a @xmath329 smbh . solving this equation for @xmath330 , the time at which @xmath331 , gives    @xmath332    after disruption",
    ". this number could be slightly sooner or later depending on the mean molecular weight ( we adopted @xmath333 g ) and the initial temperature of the star .",
    "equation should really be interpreted as an average value over the entire extent of the stream . in particular , since the density , and hence the temperature , is maximized near the marginally - bound portion of the stream ( see figure [ fig : rhoplots ] ) , recombinations will start to occur at a later time than they will toward the radial extremities of the stream where the temperature is correspondingly lower . likewise , the stream is not an infinitely thin line , but has a finite width @xmath128 ; near @xmath128 the gas temperature is lower , generating an earlier recombination time .",
    "initially  when the gas is still largely ionized  the optical depth is quite high , as evidenced from equation , meaning that recombinations will heat the gas and keep it at a roughly constant temperature of @xmath208 k. once recombinations start to occur , however , the decrease in the ionized fraction will correspondingly lower the opacity of the gas and allow more of the stream to cool , generating a `` cooling front '' that moves inward from @xmath128 @xcite . thus",
    ", while recombinations will initially heat the gas and serve to increase the specific entropy @xmath236 , at later times the optical thinness of the stream means that continued recombinations will actually serve to decrease the specific entropy .",
    "the local shear within the stream could also serve to heat the gas .",
    "if we prescribe the coefficient of dynamic viscosity by @xmath334 , then viscous heating will modify the gas energy equation via @xcite    @xmath335    where @xmath336 is the gas pressure and @xmath337 is the entropy as we defined it for a polytrope .",
    "we see that the right - hand side of this equation falls off approximately as @xmath338 ( assuming that the temporal and spatial dependence of @xmath334 is not too large ) , and consequently the viscous heating of the gas should not play a large role in the overall evolution of the debris stream .",
    "finally , the background radiation field present in the circumnuclear medium will also alter the thermodynamical evolution of the stream .",
    "if the stream is optically thin , then the entire stream would be maintained at the temperature of the radiation field @xmath339 ( in the most extreme case , @xmath339 would be the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ) .",
    "when the stream is still optically thick , on the other hand , the radiation will be reprocessed by a thin , outer sheath @xcite .",
    "when the recombinations or radiation from background sources start to heat the gas , it will become over - pressured with respect to self - gravity . in this case , if we return to equation , we see that the cross - sectional width of the stream varies as    @xmath340    where    @xmath341    is the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "if we now use this expression for @xmath128 in equation and again assume that the evolution proceeds adiabatically ( @xmath342 , where this @xmath236 is a constant that is larger than the value before heating started ) , then we find    @xmath343    while the stream is still in the marginally - bound phase , @xmath344 , and we thus find    @xmath345    in this case , we see that @xmath7 still marks the critical @xmath195 at which @xmath267 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a semi - analytic analysis of the debris streams produced from tdes , showing that there is a simple , self - similar prescription for the radial velocity of the debris .",
    "specifically , we found that if one assumes that the radial velocity varies as @xmath346 , where @xmath24 is a function of the self - similar variable @xmath347 , then the function @xmath24 is given by the solution to the equation    @xmath348    with the boundary condition @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ fig : vcomps ] compares this velocity profile to the numerical solution of @xcite , and shows that the two agree very well ( see also figure [ fig : deltavplots ] ) .",
    "we also computed the cross - sectional radius of the stream , @xmath128 , as a function of time and density .",
    "we found that , when the density and pressure are high enough , the stream width varies in a quasi - hydrostatic manner as @xmath349 .",
    "however , if the shear of the black hole dominates self - gravity and pressure , then the entire stream evolves self - similarly with @xmath127 .    the self - similar velocity profile and the solution for the cross - sectional radius of the stream allowed us , in conjunction with equation , to solve for the density of the debris stream , @xmath133 , as a function of space and time .",
    "our approximate , analytical expressions ( equations [ rhosg ] and [ rhosh ] ) were shown to agree well with the more exact , numerical solutions that used the full forms for the quantities @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( see figures [ fig : rhoplots ] and [ fig : rhoplotsex ] ) .",
    "an inverted density profile  where the density increases as a function of @xmath19  is actualized when the material is self - gravitating , while the density decreases monotonically when the shear of the black hole dominates the stream self - gravity .",
    "we analyzed the general scaling of @xmath133 with time and distance from the black hole , and showed that , during the initial stage of evolution when the orbits of the gas parcels comprising the debris stream follow @xmath101 , the portions of the stream that are self - gravitating satisfy @xmath350 .",
    "this scaling demonstrates that @xmath7 marks the critical adiabatic index above which self - gravity always dominates the tidal shear of the black hole , below which the self - gravity of the stream becomes negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "the unbound portion of the stream eventually follows @xmath243 , which shows @xmath351 and the critical adiabatic index is @xmath352 . finally , when the stream falls below the self - gravitating limit ( when @xmath260 ) , the entire stream behaves self - similarly and @xmath353 . during this self - similar regime",
    ", the density falls off as @xmath354 when @xmath101 ( marginally - bound material , early evolution of the entire stream ) and @xmath292 when @xmath243 ( unbound material , late evolution ) .",
    "finally , we showed that the finite angular momentum of the debris , which was ignored in our self - similar models , should have a small but noticeable effect as material falls back to the black hole .",
    "comparisons between our results and those of @xcite were made , demonstrating that we agreed on many aspects of the evolution of the debris stream but disagreed on some ; in particular , our finding that the width of the stream scales as @xmath355 for a @xmath7 , self - gravitating stream contrasts the scaling @xmath262 found by @xcite .",
    "we showed that when @xmath7 , the stream of debris produced from a tde should be gravitationally unstable ; however , because the density of the stream scales as @xmath261 for early times , which is identical to that of the black hole , the perturbations grow only as power - laws in time ( specifically , @xmath356 , where @xmath357 is the ratio of the density of the stellar progenitor to the density of the black hole at the time of disruption ) .",
    "we also considered how the entropy of the debris stream might evolve more realistically , given that the gas will start to recombine after a certain time and that the ambient medium may serve to heat the gas .",
    "one of the important conclusions of this analysis is that larger adiabatic indices provide enhanced gravitational fragmentation of the debris streams from tdes , which is in agreement with numerical findings @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this trend is in disagreement with those encountered in star formation , where larger adiabatic indices _ prevent _ fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that , as a gas cloud collapses under its own self - gravity , the density at any radius within the cloud is an increasing function of time . for an adiabatic equation of state",
    ", this increase in the density then corresponds to an increase in pressure , with larger adiabatic indices generating correspondingly larger increases in pressure .",
    "this increase in pressure then resists collapse to smaller scales . on the other hand ,",
    "the density is a _ decreasing _ function of time as the debris stream generated from a tde recedes from the black hole , meaning that larger adiabatic indices generate more drastic decreases in pressure for the same decrease in density .",
    "it is due to this loss of pressure support that the trend of decreased stability for larger adiabatic indices is realized in tidally - disrupted debris streams",
    ".    the adiabatic indices of most main - sequence stars lie between 4/3 and 5/3 @xcite .",
    "based on the fact that our findings here suggest @xmath10 is the critical adiabatic index above which fragmentation is possible , one is led to the conclusion that most stars will not be susceptible to gravitational instability .",
    "however , it should be noted that the cooling front initiated by radiative recombination ( see section 6.4 ) could significantly alter the equation of state of the gas , causing the stream to transition from marginally - stable to unstable .",
    "furthermore , the critical adiabatic index that demarcates the stability threshold is itself a function of both position along the stream and time , and falls to as low as 4/3 for the unbound portion of the stream at late times ( see section 5 and figure [ fig : qofmu ] ) .",
    "thus , as long as the stream remains above the self - gravitating limit , the unbound portions of many tidally - disrupted debris streams should be gravitationally unstable . finally , even though adiabatic indices greater than 5/3 are difficult to realize for most stars , values of 2 and greater are thought to be obtained for planets @xcite and compact objects @xcite .",
    "planets tidally disrupted by their host stars and the remnants of compact object mergers should therefore be unstable to self - gravitational fragmentation .",
    "our investigations assumed that the density of the circumnuclear medium does not affect the propagation of the debris stream produced from a tde .",
    "because the original stellar density is so much higher than the densities near the centers of most galaxies , this assumption is justified , with the bulk dynamics of the material largely unaffected @xcite .",
    "however , the kelvin - helmholtz instability could be important for modifying the density profile of some portions of the returning debris stream @xcite , and could also provide a physical length scale over which density perturbations occur that cause the stream to fragment .",
    "also , once the stream propagates out to very large distances from the smbh , the stream density will become comparable to that of the ambient medium , and drag effects will start to alter its motion as the stream enters a sedov - taylor phase @xcite .    in order to make comparisons with past simulations",
    ", we only computed the explicit velocity profile ( the one that depends on both @xmath19 and @xmath118 ) and compared it to the numerical solution for the case when a solar - like star is destroyed by a @xmath45 smbh and the pericenter distance of the progenitor star was equal to the tidal radius .",
    "however , we expect that this self - similar solution is accurate over a very wide range of parameters ( smbh mass , stellar mass , impact parameter @xmath358 , etc . )",
    "because it depends only on the local velocity and the local dynamical time , and this concern only for local quantities should be true for most tdes ( i.e. , we expect that the specifics of the initial conditions of the encounter are rapidly forgotten as the stream recedes from the black hole ) . even for encounters in which",
    "the star is only partially destroyed or recollapses to form a bound core @xcite , this self - similar velocity profile should hold for the disrupted debris and only break down once we get very near to the surviving core .",
    "the analysis performed here was done with the specific application of stars disrupted by supermassive black holes in mind .",
    "however , we note that many of the results we obtained can be applied to other tidally - interacting systems .",
    "in particular , the self - similar velocity profile and the physical properties of the debris stream ( the width and density distributions ) described here are also applicable to compact object mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the disruptions of planets by stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and conceivably the tidal tails generated from galactic interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
