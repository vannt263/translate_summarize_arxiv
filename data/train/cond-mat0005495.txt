    "the multi - channel kondo effect@xcite has been the subject of intensive theoretical @xcite and experimental@xcite studies , which is characterized by unusual non - fermi liquid behaviors .",
    "its applications are now extended not only to standard dilute magnetic alloys , but also to quantum dots , etc . thus far",
    ", theoretical and experimental studies on the multi - channel kondo effect have been focused on a _ static _ kondo impurity , which has been related to the measurements of the specific heat , the spin susceptibility , the resistivity , etc .",
    "this naturally motivates us to address a question whether such a nontrivial phenomenon can be observed in dynamically generated situations .",
    "the photoemission and the inverse photoemission may be one of the key experiments to study non - fermi liquid behaviors , which reveal the dynamics of a single hole or electron suddenly created in the system .",
    "we here propose _ the dynamically induced multi - channel kondo effect _",
    ", when an electron is emitted from ( or added to ) the kondo impurity by the photoemission ( inverse photoemission ) .",
    "a remarkable point is that the ground state of the system is assumed to be a completely screened kondo singlet , and non - fermi liquid properties are generated by an electron or hole suddenly created .",
    "we study low - energy critical properties of the spectrum by using the exact solution of the multi - channel kondo model @xcite combined with boundary conformal field theory ( cft)@xcite .",
    "we analyze the one - particle green function for the impurity to show its typical non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "it is further demonstrated that this effect can be observed even in a homogeneous system without impurities . to show this explicitly , we apply the analysis to the photoemission spectrum in a quantum spin chain with spin @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly illustrate the idea of the dynamically induced multi - channel kondo effect , and derive low - energy scaling forms of the one - particle green function .",
    "we discuss non - fermi liquid properties in the spectrum by exactly evaluating the critical exponents . in ",
    "3 the analysis is then applied to the photoemission spectrum for a quantum spin chain .",
    "brief summary is given in  4 .",
    "we note that preliminary results on this issue have been reported in ref .",
    "let us consider the spin-@xmath1 kondo impurity which is _ completely screened _ by conduction electrons with @xmath2 channels .",
    "the impurity spin is assumed to be composed of @xmath3 electrons by the strong hund coupling . to study the core - electron photoemission spectrum , we start with spectral properties of the impurity green function , @xmath4 > \\cr     & & { \\qquad \\ }                         {                 \\displaystyle                   { \\quad }                 \\atop                  {                   \\displaystyle                     = g^{>}(t ) + g^{<}(t ) ,                  }               } \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the annihilation operator for one of core electrons which compose the impurity spin and t is the conventional time - ordered product . here , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the green function , which is restricted in @xmath8 . for the photoemission , we consider @xmath7 . to be specific , we discuss the case that a core electron is emitted as depicted in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , for which the binding energy @xmath9 ( measured from the fermi energy ) is assumed to be larger than the band width @xmath10 . then in the excited state the overscreening system is generated , which is referred to as _ the dynamically induced overscreening kondo effect_.@xcite at the low - energy regime around @xmath11 , we may express the operator as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the corresponding boundary operator@xcite in boundary cft , which characterizes the boundary critical phenomena .",
    "it is known that the fermi - edge singularity@xcite is reformulated by the boundary operator,@xcite in which nontrivial effects for the overscreening kondo effect are incorporated in @xmath14 .",
    "we write down the one - particle green function @xmath7 as , @xmath15 on the other hand , for the inverse photoemission , an added electron is combined with the local spin @xmath1 to form higher spin @xmath16 by the strong hund - coupling , as shown in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "then we may write @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy cost to make @xmath16 spin , and @xmath19 is another boundary operator which controls the undersreening kondo effect induced by the inverse photoemission .",
    "we have @xmath20 in order to evaluate the critical exponents , we now employ the idea of finite - size scaling@xcite in cft .",
    "the scaling form of the correlators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 in the long - time asymptotic region .",
    "according to the finite - size scaling , the boundary dimensions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are read from the lowest excitation energy @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 corresponds to the system size of one dimension in the radial direction .",
    "we thus end up with the relevant scaling forms as @xmath30 where @xmath31 that @xmath32 represents @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in both cases ,",
    "the spectral functions have power - law edge singularity due to the _ dynamically induced multi - channel kondo effect _ , which will be shown to exhibit non - fermi liquid properties .",
    "we now discuss low - energy critical properties by exactly evaluating @xmath24 and @xmath25 . to this end",
    ", we consider the multi - channel kondo model , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the creation operator for conduction electrons with spin @xmath37 and orbital indices , @xmath38 .",
    "the exact solution of this model@xcite is expressed in terms of the bethe equations for spin rapidities @xmath39 and charge rapidities @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of electrons and @xmath43 is the one - dimensional system size .",
    "it is assumed that the impurity with spin @xmath44 is completely screened in the ground state .",
    "then , the core - level photoemission suddenly reduces the impurity spin , thus inducing the overscreening kondo effect with @xmath45 . as for the underscreening effect induced by the inverse photoemission",
    ", the condition is replaced by @xmath46 . at zero temperature the ground - state properties",
    "are described by the @xmath47th order string solutions,@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 which is restricted by @xmath51 . here",
    ", @xmath3 represents the number of orbitals .",
    "it is well known that a naive application of finite - size techniques based on the string hypothesis turns out to fail for the overscreening case at zero magnetic field.@xcite this difficulty comes from an improper treatment of the @xmath52 symmetry sector in terms of the string solutions . however , as long as the finite magnetic field is concerned , we can use the bethe equations to describe its critical properties .",
    "we will separately discuss the case of zero - magnetic field , by incorporating @xmath52 sector correctly.@xcite by applying standard procedures to eq.([7 ] ) , it is straightforward to exactly evaluate the lowest excitation energy in magnetic fields , for which one of the impurity electrons is assumed to be removed from the system , @xmath53 although the above finite - size correction is apparently similar to that for 1d solvable systems with a static impurity or boundaries,@xcite _ the final - state interaction _ induced by photoemission is included in the present case.@xcite thus all the features which are governed by the dynamical kondo effect can be read from this quantity .    by applying the finite - size scaling in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , the critical exponent @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is now obtained as , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the charge scattering phase shift , which is caused by a created hole as in the ordinary fermi edge singularity.@xcite this term depends on the detail of potential scattering .",
    "it is mentioned that the second term with the phase shift @xmath57 is caused by the kondo effect , which is explicitly evaluated as , @xmath58 where @xmath59 here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined by @xmath62 the key quantity , @xmath57 , is obtained by using wiener - hopf method , @xcite @xmath63    in fig .",
    "2 we display the critical exponent @xmath64 for the overscreening case as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "note that the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath65 without @xmath66 is determined by the dynamical kondo effect , because the charge scattering phase shift @xmath56 does not depend on magnetic fields . particularly in weak magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath67 , the obtained exponent behaves as @xmath68 it is seen that the phase shift , @xmath57 , gives rise to the anomalous magnetic - field dependence of the exponent .",
    "this non - fermi liquid behavior is characteristic of the overscreening effect.@xcite another interesting feature in the overscreening effect appears at @xmath69 .",
    "we recall here that the symmetry is enhanced from u(1 ) to su(2 ) at @xmath69 , for which the boundary dimension @xmath70 for the spin sector is analytically obtained by employing fusion rules hypothesis proposed by affleck and ludwig , @xcite @xmath71 which is a typical conformal dimension for level-@xmath3 su(2 ) kac - moody algebra .",
    "note that the critical exponent shows a discontinuity at @xmath69 , @xmath72 which is caused by the fact that @xmath52 symmetric sector is massless only at @xmath69,@xcite as already mentioned .",
    "we now move to the underscreening case induced by the inverse photoemission .",
    "the calculated critical exponent @xmath73 is shown as a function of magnetic fields in fig .",
    "3 . for weak magnetic field , the obtained exponent @xmath74 behaves as @xmath75 which is characteristic of the underscreening system .",
    "in contrast to the overscreening case , there is no discontinuity in the exponent in this case , @xmath76 .",
    "this completes a general description of the dynamically induced kondo effect .",
    "an important point to be emphasized is that this kind of phenomenon may be observed not only for impurity systems but also for other related quantum systems , which will be explicitly discussed in the next section .",
    "we now wish to demonstrate that the dynamically induced kondo effect proposed here may be observed for gapless quantum spin systems _ which do not possess impurities_. as an example , we consider an integrable antiferromagnetic spin chain with spin @xmath0 , for which the exact solution is available even for the case with doped holes.@xcite the photoemission suddenly removes one electron from the spin system , and thus bears an _ impurity site _ with spin @xmath77 . in the final state , this impurity spin is screened by host spins , and as a result the overscreening kondo effect may be dynamically induced .",
    "it is remarkable that the induced impurity in this case can move through the lattice via the exchange interaction , and the edge singularity is thus governed by a _ mobile _",
    "multichannel kondo impurity.@xcite    let us consider the gapless @xmath78 spin chain with a mobile @xmath79 impurity as an example .",
    "although in more general situations including non - integrable models , the higher spin should be a half - odd integer , the present treatment can be straightforwardly extended to such cases .",
    "we here consider an integrable spin chain derived by the quantum inverse scattering method , @xcite @xmath80                            \\right )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spin @xmath81 with @xmath82 or 1/2 , and @xmath83 permutes the spin on sites @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in order to deal with the excited states when an electron is emitted from the spin chain , we write down the bethe equations for the spin-@xmath1 chain with _ one hole _",
    "being doped , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of down spins and @xmath88 are spin rapidities .",
    "note that the hole rapidity @xmath89 appears in the above equation , which characterizes a massive charge excitation suddenly created .",
    "thus , @xmath89 specifies the hole momentum @xmath90 .",
    "it is seen that the above spin - charge scattering term , which describes the final - state interaction , corresponds to the impurity term in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the manipulation illustrated in the previous section enables us to exactly calculate the scaling dimension for the one - particle green function via the finite - size corrections,@xcite @xmath91 the quantity @xmath92 often referred to as the dressed charge @xcite is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 and the cut - off parameter @xmath95 is related to the magnetization @xmath96 , @xmath97 the density function @xmath98 is determined by the following integral equation , @xmath99 we stress that two key quantities @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which contain the effect of a mobile impurity , are introduced in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , @xmath102 where @xmath103 here we have introduced the phase function , @xmath104 these quantities are alternatively represented in terms of the phase shifts @xmath105 and @xmath106 at the left and right fermi points in massless spin excitations : @xmath107 .",
    "we mention that the asymmetric phase shift @xmath101 is inherent in a _ mobile _ kondo impurity , different from a localized impurity in  2 .",
    "note that the scaling dimension @xmath108 depends on the hole momentum @xmath90 through the asymmetric phase shift .",
    "let us now discuss low - energy critical properties in the photoemission spectra .",
    "we write down the one - particle green function which depends on the momentum @xmath90 , @xmath109 with @xmath110 , where @xmath108 is the scaling dimension in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) and @xmath111 is the dispersion of the charge excitation generated by the photoemission . in fig .",
    "4 we show the obtained critical exponent as a function of the momentum @xmath90 for the @xmath78 case .    this anomalous power - law behavior and the momentum dependence of @xmath112",
    "are caused by a suddenly induced _ mobile",
    "_ kondo impurity .",
    "as we discussed in  2 , the discontinuity of the exponent @xmath113 at @xmath114 is caused by the @xmath52 symmetric sector.@xcite .    in this way",
    ", the dynamically induced kondo effect proposed here may be expected to be observed in photoemission experiments for quantum spin chains . in order for this phenomenon to be observed , there may be several problems to be resolved ; preparation of a proper 1d sample , experiments with high resolution , etc .",
    "anyway , it is desired to experimentally find or synthesize rather ideal spin chain systems without the magnetic order even at low temperatures .",
    "in summary we have proposed the multi - channel kondo effect dynamically induced by the photoemission and the inverse photoemission , for which the ground state is a completely screened kondo singlet . by studying low - energy critical properties in the photoemission spectra",
    ", it has been found that the anomalous behavior generated by this effect is indeed characteristic of the multi - channel kondo system . in particular , we have demonstrated that the idea proposed here can be directly applied to homogeneous quantum spin systems without any impurity . it has been shown in this case that a _ mobile _ kondo impurity suddenly created by the photoemission gives rise to the momentum - dependent anomalous exponent .",
    "although we have mainly focused on the photoemission spectra for magnetic impurity systems in this paper , it should be noted that the idea can be directly applied to the photoemission spectrum in quantum dot systems , for which a multilevel quantum dot with the hund coupling plays a role of the kondo impurity . in this connection , it is also interesting to apply a similar idea to the optical absorption spectra in a quantum dot , as recently demonstrated .",
    "@xcite in such cases , not only the linear but also the non - linear optics play an important role,@xcite which may provide interesting phenomena related to the dynamically induced kondo effect .",
