    "the studies of complex systems are widespread among the physical community@xcite and a large amount of these investigations deals with records of real numbers ordered in time or in space . based on these time series ,",
    "the aim of these works is to extract some features , patterns or laws which govern a given system .",
    "there is an extensive literature of statistical tools devoted to analyze time series .",
    "for instance , the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa)@xcite can be used to examine the presence of correlations in the data . however , many of these analysis are not focused on the original data but in sub - series like the absolute value , the return value or the volatility series@xcite .",
    "in particular , a time series can be converted into a symbolic sequence by using a discrete partition in the data domain and assigning a symbol to each site of partition , technique that is known as symbol statistics@xcite . a priori",
    ", any data set can be mapped into a symbolic sequence by using a specific rule ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a typical analysis performed for this symbolic sequence is to evaluate its block entropy .",
    "this approach measures the amount of information contained in the block or the average information necessary to predict subsequent symbols .",
    "this analysis was applied to a wide range of topics , including dna sequences@xcite . in this context ,",
    "buiatti _ _ et al.__@xcite introduced a numerical model which generates long - range correlations among the symbols of a symbolic sequence , leading to a slow growth of the usual block entropy .    motivated by this anomalous behavior in the block entropy , our main goal is to construct a diffusive process based on these sequences .",
    "the diffusive processes generated with these sequences are expected to be markovian or non - markovian depending on the conditions imposed on these sequences . for markovian processes or short - term memory systems",
    "the mean square displacement grows linearly in time . on the other hand ,",
    "non - markovian processes or long - term memory systems often display deviations of this linear behavior , being better described by a power law on time with the exponent @xmath1 .",
    "this is the fingerprint of the anomalous diffusion and depending on the @xmath1 value we may have superdiffusion ( @xmath2 ) or subdiffusion ( @xmath3 ) and for @xmath4 the usual spreading is recovered .",
    "several physical systems exhibit this power law pattern .",
    "for instance , porous substrate@xcite , diffusion of high molecular weight polyisopropylacrylamide in nanopores@xcite , highly confined hard disk fluid mixture@xcite , fluctuating particle fluxes@xcite , diffusion on fractals@xcite , ferrofluid@xcite , nanoporous material@xcite , and colloids@xcite .    in this context , the model proposed by buiatti _",
    "has an essential ingredient leading to anomalous diffusion : the long - term memory present in their symbolic sequences .",
    "we will show that a diffusive process based on these sequences lead to a rich diffusive picture , where ballistic diffusion , superdiffusion , subdiffusion , and also usual diffusion can emerge , depending on the model parameters and on the mode of construction of the process .",
    "in addition , we compare our numerical results with analytic models based on continuous - time random walk@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present and review some properties of the model .",
    "section 3 is devoted to define erratic trajectories from the sequences as well as to investigate their diffusive behavior .",
    "a comparative analysis of this diffusive aspect with continuous - time random walk viewpoint is performed in section 4 .",
    "finally , we end with a summary and some concluding comments .",
    "the original model@xcite is a numerical experiment that generates equally likely symbols which are repeated among the sequence following a power law probability density . in order to describe the model ,",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of symbols and @xmath6 represent a sequence where @xmath7 .",
    "to specify each @xmath8 , we initially select randomly one of the symbols of the alphabet @xmath9 and repeated it @xmath10 times inside the sequence , in such way that @xmath11 .",
    "the number @xmath10 is obtained from @xmath12 + 1 \\quad \\mbox{with } \\quad y = a\\left[\\frac{1}{(1-\\eta)^{1/(\\mu-1)}}-1\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are * real * parameters , @xmath15 is a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval [ 0,1 ] , and @xmath16 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath17 . by using this procedure , a typical symbolic sequence with @xmath18 and @xmath19 is @xmath20 + 1=3}\\underbrace{+1,+1,+1,+1,+1}_{[y]+1=5 }                       \\underbrace{-1,-1,}_{[y]+1=2 }   \\right\\rbrace\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] since @xmath15 is a random number uniformly distributed , @xmath17 will be a positive random number .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 can be calculated in a straightforward manner leading to @xmath22 therefore , the model basically consists in the repetitions of @xmath10 blocks of symbols with @xmath10 distributed according a power law of exponent @xmath23 in the asymptotic limit .",
    "furthermore , the first and the second moments of @xmath21 are given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 note that when @xmath26 both moments diverge and when @xmath27 the second moment diverges while the first one remains finite .",
    "thus , when @xmath23 is close to 2 , @xmath10 can be very large filling a significante part of the sequence @xmath28 with the same symbol .",
    "on the other hand , very large values of @xmath10 become rare for @xmath23 greater than 3 which makes the sequence highly alternating .",
    "it is well established that this method of building symbolic sequences generates long - range correlations between elements of the sequence characterized by a power law correlation function ( see the analytical development of buiatti _ et al . _",
    "it was also studied that correlations lead to a non - linear growth of the usual block entropy , i.e. , the usual entropy is not extensive for @xmath29 . in such context",
    ", these sequences were investigated in the framework of the so called non - extensive tsallis statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the tsallis block entropy @xmath30 can recover extensivity for a specific choice of the entropic index @xmath31@xcite .",
    "for three values of @xmath23 when considering the two symbol alphabet @xmath19 and @xmath32 . note that depending on the values of @xmath23 the trajectories are very different.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for three values of @xmath23 when considering the two symbol alphabet @xmath19 and @xmath32 . note that depending on the values of @xmath23 the trajectories are very different.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for three values of @xmath23 when considering the two symbol alphabet @xmath19 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that depending on the values of @xmath23 the trajectories are very different.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as we raised in the introduction , long - term correlations or non - markovian processes frequently present anomalous properties when investigated in the context of diffusion . in this direction , to construct erratic trajectories from these sequences may yield a rich diffusive scenario based on a simple model .",
    "this point has been noted by buiatti _",
    "_ and also briefly discussed by us in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a simple and direct way to obtain the trajectories is to consider that each symbol in a sequence represents the length of the jump of a particle in erratic movement .",
    "the position of the symbol plays the role of time . in this manner",
    ", the variable @xmath33 represents the position of the particle after a time @xmath0 , which is an integer because of the construction .",
    "let us start our investigation by considering the simplest symmetric case , i.e. , the two symbols alphabet @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the particle is equally likely to jump to the right or to the left according to whether @xmath34 or @xmath35 and the variable @xmath36 represents a random walk - like process where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and so on , with @xmath0 playing the role of _ time_. figure  [ fig : traj ] illustrates @xmath36 for three values of @xmath23 with @xmath32 .",
    "note that the trajectories are remarkably different depending on the values of @xmath23 . for small values of @xmath23 ( @xmath29 )",
    ", we can see that the trajectories are governed by two mechanisms : spatial localization and large jumps . when @xmath26 , larger is the jump , reflecting the fact that all moments of @xmath21 diverge for @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , the second moment of @xmath21 is finite for @xmath41 and the trajectories are very similar to usual random walks .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , when dealing with diffusive process , it is very common to investigate how the particles are spreading by evaluating the variance @xmath42 , where the angle brackets denote an ensemble average .",
    "the usual brownian motion@xcite is characterized by @xmath43 and by a gaussian propagator @xmath44 which is a direct consequence of the central limit theorem and the markovian nature of the underlying stochastic process . on the other hand , the anomalous diffusion behavior is usually distinguished by the value of the exponent @xmath1@xcite in @xmath45 we have subdiffusion when @xmath46 and superdiffusion when @xmath2 .",
    "the crossover between subdiffusion and superdiffusion corresponds to the usual brownian motion and the case @xmath47 is the ballistic regime .    in this direction",
    ", we evaluate the variance for several values of @xmath23 over an ensemble average of @xmath48 realizations as shown in figure  [ fig : var]a . in a log - log plot the slope of the curve @xmath49 versus @xmath0 is numerically equal to the exponent @xmath1 which is visibly changing with the parameter @xmath23 . in figure",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    next , we investigate the role of size of the symbol space by considering that more symbols are present in the alphabet @xmath9 .",
    "we consider first the presence of zeros , i.e. , @xmath63 where each symbol is equiprobable within the sequence .",
    "the zero symbol allows the particles to stay motionless for a certain time what could be related to subdiffusion .",
    "however , as we show in figure  [ fig : var2]a the presence of zeros in the sequence does not significantly change the profile of the relation @xmath23 versus @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , even if zero symbol becoming more probable within the sequence , i.e. , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is number of zero symbols in the alphabet , this result remains valid , as we also show in figure  [ fig : var2]a .",
    "second , we study larger alphabets from @xmath65 to @xmath66 and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : var2]a .",
    "we found that the relation @xmath23 versus @xmath1 does not depend on the size of the symbol space .",
    "this relation is also robust for variations of the parameter @xmath73 and for non - symmetric alphabets . in particular",
    ", the parameter @xmath73 only produces a multiplicative effect in the equation ( [ eq : anomalous ] ) and a non - symmetric alphabet produces a drift which does not affect the spreading of the system .    until now we were not able to generate subdiffusion , even adding the zero symbol more likely to occur .",
    "this result suggests that only superdiffusion can emerge when considering the same value of @xmath23 for the symbols that lead to jumps and for the zero symbol that lead to absence of motion .",
    "the reasons for this behavior are related to the fact that even the zero symbol being much more likely than other symbols , the number of repetitions @xmath10 is independent of the symbol .",
    "thus , the particles can remain at rest for a long time but the flights can be equally long , since for @xmath29 there is no characteristic scale for @xmath10 .    in this direction ,",
    "let us consider a sequence where the jumping symbols are related to @xmath74 value ( @xmath75 ) and the zero symbol is related other @xmath67 value . in this manner , the flights have a characteristic scale while the rest periods may or may not have this characteristic scale ( depending on the @xmath67 value ) .",
    "the results concerning this scenario are shown in figure  [ fig : var2]b where we show the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath67 for a fixed value of @xmath68 ( different values of @xmath75 does not affect this relation ) . from this figure",

    "( see also @xcite ) , the random walk process is fully specified by the function @xmath86 , the probability density to move a distance @xmath87 in time @xmath88 .",

    "there are two fundamental approaches to the ctrw : ( i ) the decoupled and ( ii ) the coupled formalisms . in ( i ) the function @xmath86 is supposed to factor in the form @xmath89 , i.e. , the jumping and the waiting time are independent random variables . for ( ii )",
    "both process are coupled , a jump of a certain length may involve a time cost or vice - versa .",
    "this coupled form commonly leads to more cumbersome calculations . here",
