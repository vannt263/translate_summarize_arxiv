    "the physical characteristics of superfluid @xmath3he can often be well described in terms of the elementary excitations from a coherent ground state , which acts as a vacuum state for the excitations .",
    "the elementary excitations are phonons at low temperatures and both phonons and rotons at higher temperatures . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the excitations form a gas of quasiparticles which behaves in a similar way to a gas of atoms . when the excitations are incident on an interface with a solid , they reflect and create a pressure .",
    "however there are differences from a gas of atoms ; the dispersion law is very different and there are excitations with a negative group velocity . also excitations in the liquid helium can create phonons in the solid , and vice versa . the vapour pressure due to phonons and rotons and quantum evaporation , was considered in @xcite .",
    "the dispersion curve of superfluid helium is non - monotonic and consists of three monotonic parts .",
    "because of this the gas of quasiparticles of superfluid helium has three quite distinct components , phonons , @xmath0 rotons and @xmath1 rotons , each component corresponding to a monotonic region of the curve , see fig.[fig1 ] and ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 rotons are described by the descending part of the dispersion curve and have negative group velocity , so that their momentum is directed opposite to the direction of propagation .",
    "there are many indirect experiments that verify the quasiparticle description of thermal fluctuations in he  ii .",
    "moreover , there are also experiments @xcite , in which phonons and rotons are directly detected .",
    "the @xmath0 rotons were shown to have a negative group velociy , relative to their momentum , in @xcite .        in this paper",
    "we obtain the pressure of superfluid helium quasiparticles on the boundary with another continuous medium .",
    "the processes that underly the interaction of the quasiparticles with an interface , their reflection , transmission and creation , are considered self - consistently in a general approach .",
    "we take into account the possibility of the conversion of quasiparticles into each other , on reflection from the interface , and derive the separate contributions of phonon , @xmath0 roton and @xmath1 roton modes to the full pressure of quasiparticles on the interface .",
    "we start with a short section on the thermodynamics of the gas of superfluid helium quasiparticles and derive an expression for the pressure . in the next section we consider momentum transfer to the interface due to different quasiparticles interacting with it .",
    "we derive the total pressure of quasiparticles on the interface , as well as the individual contributions of phonon , @xmath0 roton and @xmath1 roton modes to it .",
    "we show that no detailed expressions for the probabilities of the processes are necessary ; the principle of detailed balance is all that is needed to derive the pressure . the pressure can be expressed in the form for the pressure of a classical gas on an interface , although the meaning is different .",
    "the part of the pressure due to @xmath0 roton is shown to be negative .",
    "it is compensated by the positive part of @xmath1 rotons , and the total positive pressure is less than the absolute values of either the @xmath0 or @xmath1 rotons .    these results should be applicable for any two adjacent continuous media at low temperatures ; in particular we see that the resultant force , with which quasiparticles of both media are acting on the interface , is directed from the medium with lesser sound velocity to the medium with the greater one .",
    "we also show that the expression for the total pressure is the same as that derived from thermodynamics .",
    "we then discuss contributions to the pressure from the @xmath1 rotons and @xmath0 rotons as calculated by thermodynamics and kinematics .",
    "the two theories give very different results and it is clear that the kinematic approach is correct .",
    "hence it is impossible to calculate their separate contrbutions to the fountain pressure from their separate entropies .    in the last section we suggest an experiment that would measure the negative pressure that the @xmath0 rotons exert on the boundary with a solid",
    "the dispersion curve of superfluid helium @xmath4 has the maxon maximum @xmath5 at @xmath6 and roton minimum @xmath7 at @xmath8 , see fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "so for the range of energies @xmath9 there are three real roots of equation @xmath10 , which corresponding to phonons , @xmath0 rotons , and @xmath1 rotons .",
    "we number the roots in the ascending order of their absolute values @xmath11 : @xmath12 .",
    "thus @xmath13 corresponds to phonons , @xmath14 to @xmath0 rotons , and @xmath15 to @xmath1 rotons .",
    "the thermodynamics of he  ii quasiparticles starts from the helmholtz free energy , per unit volume , of superfluid helium ( see for example @xcite ) , which can be written as a sum @xmath16 , where @xmath17\\quad \\mbox{for}\\;i\\!=\\!1,2,3\\ ] ] are the phonons and @xmath18 rotons contributions to @xmath19 .",
    "here @xmath20 is the bose - einstein distribution and @xmath21 boltzmann constant .",
    "the integration domains of the integrals are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the analytical expressions are obtained with the help of the usual approximations of the dispersion relation : linear for phonons @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the sound velocity of liquid helium ) , and parabolic for rotons @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the so - called roton mass ) .",
    "usually the @xmath0 and @xmath1 roton s contributions are calculated together , and one obtains ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) @xmath29    the pressure @xmath30 of a system is given by @xmath31 so as eqs .",
    "( [ phononf ] ) and ( [ rotonf ] ) are the free energies per unit volume , they are the negative of the pressure . hence the total pressure @xmath30 due to phonons and rotons",
    "is : @xmath32    as this pressure is temperature dependent , it causes the fountain effect , which was observed by allen and jones @xcite .",
    "consider two reservoirs of liquid helium at temperatures @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and pressures @xmath30 and @xmath35 , respectively . hence    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the entropy per unit volume .",
    "the second term is the usual expression for the fountain pressure given by london @xcite .",
    "it can also be obtained from the equation for the superfluid velocity @xmath38 , in the two - fluid model , with @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "if we treat the phonons and rotons in a naive way , and consider them as a classical gas ( without any justification ) , the classical formula for the pressure of a gas of for each component , gives @xmath40 here @xmath41 are group velocities of quasiparticles .",
    "due to the negative dispersion of @xmath0 rotons , their contributions then should be negative .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ pclass ] ) is valid for classical particles , it is not justified for phonons and rotons which do not just reflect from the surface but have other possibilities such as a mode change .",
    "for example a phonon can change into @xmath1 roton .",
    "however , this classical approach suggests that the negative dispersion of @xmath0 rotons will lead to a negative presure contribution .    to calculate the negative pressure of the @xmath0 rotons we use a kinematic approach in the next section .",
    "we derive the contributions of phonons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 rotons to pressure by calculating the momentum transferred to the helium - solid interface when quasiparticles of different types are incident on it .",
    "we also calculate the pressure of a quasiparticle beam incident on an interface which can not be obtained from thermodynamics .",
    "let there be a flat boundary @xmath42 between superfluid helium and a solid .",
    "the solid has a monotonic dispersion relation and occupies the region @xmath43 , and superfluid helium with its non - monotonic dispersion relation @xmath4 fills the region @xmath44 . for simplicity",
    "we take into account only the longitudinal phonons in the solid , to which we assign index @xmath45 .",
    "generalising the problem , to take into account the presence of both longitudinal and transverse phonons , is trivial , as can be seen below , and actually does not affect the results .    when any quasiparticle , of energy @xmath46 , is incident on the interface it is destroyed , and a quasiparticle of one of the four types @xmath47 is created on the interface .",
    "there are three possibilities in the helium ( @xmath48 ) and one in the solid ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the analogous situation appears in ordinary acoustics , when the incident phonon with linear dispersion may with some probability be reflected ( i.e. it is destroyed and the reflected phonon is created ) , or with some probability may turn into the phonon of the other medium .",
    "our case is different because the dispersion relation of he  ii is nonlinear and nonmonotonic , so the quasiparticle created in helium can be of any of the three possible types .",
    "consider a quasiparticle of type @xmath49 with momentum @xmath50 and energy @xmath51 be incident on the interface with the solid and a quasiparticle of type @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is created with probability @xmath54 .",
    "two examples are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "energy is conserved in these processes . due to the translational invariance of the interface ,",
    "the transverse component of momentum @xmath55 is also conserved .",
    "so @xmath56 and @xmath55 are set by the incident quasiparticle ; the momenta of the other quasiparticles are @xmath11 , and the angles of propagation @xmath57 , measured from the normal , are found from @xmath58 for @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath59 is determined by the dispersion relation of the solid",

    "the created quasiparticles travel away from the interface , but the momentum of the @xmath0 roton is towards the interface .",

    ". it is found from momentum conservation @xmath65 on summing @xmath64 over the channels @xmath53 with their probabilities @xmath54 , taking into account that for the incident wave @xmath66 , and using the normalizing condition @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the average momentum transferred to the interface per one incident quasiparticle of type @xmath49 .",
    "let the incident quasiparticles be in thermodynamic equilibrium , with the bose - einstein distribution @xmath70 .",
    "then the momentum transferred to the interface , per unit time per unit area , by the incident quasiparticles of type @xmath49 is @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the group velocity of quasiparticle @xmath49 , @xmath73 for @xmath48 and @xmath74 , so that @xmath75 is the number of quasiparticles @xmath49 incident on the interface per unit time per unit area .",
    "the domain of integration is @xmath76 , and the probabilities @xmath54 are nonzero only when both @xmath62 and @xmath61 are real , so the momentum @xmath77 is real .",
    "the principle of detailed balance can be written in terms of probabilities as functions of the conserved quantities , @xmath56 and @xmath78 : @xmath79 it is convenient to change the variables of integration in eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) to the arguments of @xmath80 .",
    "then from eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) @xmath81 the integral of the sum should be treated as the sum of integrals , with domains of integration in which the integrands are real .",
    "the full momentum transferred to the interface per unit time per unit area by all the incident quasiparticles , @xmath82 , is the sum of eq .",
    "( [ pie - p ] ) over @xmath47 . with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ normalization ] ) and ( [ detbalance ] ) , we obtain @xmath83 so , on summing , we see that the total pressure does not depend on the probabilities @xmath54 and thus on the reflection properties of the interface .",
    "the terms that remain , @xmath62 , reflect the bulk properties of the two adjacent media , i.e. their dispersion relations .",
    "taking into account the signs of @xmath62 ( [ rot- ] ) , we have @xmath84 , and then on taking the interior integral , we obtain @xmath85      the quantity @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ p3d ] ) is the difference between the pressure of the phonons in the solid @xmath86 where @xmath43 and the pressure of the quasiparticles in the superfluid @xmath87 where @xmath44 : @xmath88 .",
    "the contributions from phonons ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath0 rotons ( @xmath14 ) , and @xmath1 rotons ( @xmath15 ) to the total pressure of the quasiparticles in the superfluid are @xmath89 the pressure of the longitudinal phonons of the solid @xmath90 is given by relation ( [ pi3d ] ) for @xmath45 , in which the signum is assumed value @xmath91 .",
    "the transverse phonons would give additional pressure @xmath92 , given also by relation ( [ pi3d ] ) with the corresponding dispersion relation and positive sign , but we shall see later that it is unnecessary to include them .",
    "changing the integration variables back to @xmath93 , we obtain that the expressions for each of the contributions of quasiparticles @xmath49 for @xmath47 take the universal form of the gas - kinetic equation for the pressure of a gas of classical particles ( [ pclass ] ) .",
    "we see that the contribution @xmath94 of the @xmath0 rotons is _ negative_. the reason is their negative group velocity @xmath95 , which determines the sign of @xmath96 in eqs .",
    "( [ rot- ] ) and ( [ pi3d ] ) and enters explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ pclass ] ) .",
    "the contribution @xmath94 is composed of the momentum that the incident @xmath0 rotons bring to the interface ( which is negative ) , as well as the negative momentum transferred to the interface on creation of the @xmath0 rotons by either phonons , or rotons , or phonons in the solid .",
    "the latter terms are proportional to coefficients @xmath97 and are summed up in such a way that the coefficients disappear , and the expression for the full pressure ( [ pi3d ] ) takes the form that could be obtained by considering ( wrongly ) that all the quasiparticles are just specularly reflected without mode change or transmission .",
    "hence we have proved the classical formula ( [ pclass ] ) to be applicable for the gas of quasiparticles , for which mode changes on interaction with the interface are allowed .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that one should distinguish the pressure of quasiparticles of type @xmath49 incident on the interface , which is given by @xmath77 of eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) and essentially depends on explicit functions @xmath54 , from the contribution of the mode @xmath49 to full pressure @xmath87 , given by definition by @xmath98 of eq .",
    "( [ pi3d ] ) or ( [ pclass ] ) , which does not depend on @xmath54 .    in order to obtain eq .",
    "( [ pi3d ] ) and ( [ pclass ] ) , we did not make any assumptions on the explicit forms of either dispersion relation @xmath99 or the probabilities @xmath54 , so the result ( [ pclass ] ) should be applicable to any two continuous media with a common boundary ( see for example @xcite ) . as a consequence , from eq .",
    "( [ pi3d ] ) we see that quasiparticles of the medium with lesser sound velocity act on the interface with greater pressure than those of the medium with greater sound velocity .",
    "if there is more than one type of quasiparticles in either of the media , the corresponding contributions to pressure from the branches are just summed up .",
    "the inbalance of pressure , due to the quasiparticles , is compensated by the elastic forces in the medium .",
    "the sound velocity of the solid is usually much greater than that of superfluid helium , so the pressure of phonons in the solid is negligibly small ( so the trivial extension of the model including transverse phonons is unnecessary ) .",
    "the partial pressures of the helium quasiparticles @xmath100 for @xmath48 can be calculated with the usual approximation of the dispersion relation : linear for phonons and parabolic for rotons ( as in ( [ phononf ] ) and ( [ rotonf ] ) ) .",
    "then for rotons we have @xmath101 , and considering the second term small , we obtain @xmath102 the upper sign ( minus ) here corresponds to the @xmath103 rotons ( @xmath14 ) , and the lower sign ( plus ) to the @xmath104 rotons ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the sum of the pressures in eqs .",
    "( [ p1appr ] ) and ( [ p23appr ] ) give the pressure deduced from thermodynamics in eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) .",
    "the contributions of phonons , @xmath103 and @xmath104 rotons to pressure are shown in fig.[fig3 ] . for temperatures",
    "@xmath105 k the second term in ( [ p23appr ] ) is about four times smaller than the first one .",
    "so the separate contributions of @xmath104 and @xmath103 rotons , that differ in sign , are much larger than their sum @xmath106 .        the measured saturated vapour pressure may be expressed to a good approximation as , @xcite , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the helium atom mass , @xmath109 k the binding energy of an atom in the liquid ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) . the eq .",
    "( [ svp ] ) describes well the experimental data for temperatures from @xmath110 k to @xmath111 k.    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ p23appr ] ) and ( [ svp ] ) , we get @xmath112 this ratio is at most @xmath113 at @xmath114 k and decreases exponentially at lower temperatures , where the phonon contribution to pressure becomes dominant .",
    "so in the full temperature range the saturated vapour pressure is at least an order of magnitude less than the pressure of quasiparticles ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "this means that the liquid is in tension at the saturated vapour pressure .",
    "the separate contributions of the @xmath1 rotons and the @xmath0 rotons can not be obtained from thermodynamics .",
    "the contributions to the free energy in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) for @xmath1 rotons and @xmath0 rotons , are approximately equal .",
    "they both give an approximately equal and positive contribution to the pressure .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the results of the kinematic analysis , which shows that the contributions to the pressure of the @xmath0 rotons and @xmath1 rotons are negative and positve respectively , and the modulus of the pressure due to the @xmath1 rotons is larger than that from the @xmath0 rotons .",
    "however , the separate contribution to the pressure from the phonons , is the same by thermodynamics and kinematics .",
    "for the same reason , the separate contributions of the @xmath1 rotons and the @xmath0 rotons to the fountain pressure , can not be calculated from their separate contributions to the entropy , which are both positive .",
    "however the contribution of the phonons and all the rotons can be separated .",
    "the increments of pressures @xmath115 and @xmath116 that are caused by the increment of temperature @xmath117 @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the entropies per unit of volume of a phonon gas @xmath119 and roton gas @xmath120 respectively , obtained from ( [ phononf ] ) and ( [ rotonf ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then the full increment of pressure @xmath121 that corresponds to @xmath117 is @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the entropy of superfluid helium .",
    "the partial fountain pressures @xmath124 can only be obtained from @xmath125 if a term is added and subtracted from @xmath126 .",
    "this term is the derivative of the leading term of eq .",
    "( [ p23appr ] ) .",
    "it is added to obtain @xmath127 and subtracted to obtain @xmath128 , thus giving @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the above reasoning might be an indication that in the general case , thermodynamics alone can not separate the contributions of different branches of a dispersion curve to the thermodynamic quantities , and in particular for the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 rotons .",
    "we now suggest a way to observe the negative momentum transfer from @xmath0 rotons to an interface , by measuring the pressure caused by a pulse of incident @xmath0 rotons .",
    "the beam of @xmath0 rotons could be created by having a pulse of high - energy helium phonons ( @xmath131-phonons , created in experiments @xcite ) , incident on the interface with another solid ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "it has been predicted , see @xcite , that the mode changing reflection can efficiently produce @xmath0 rotons .",
    "the beam of @xmath0 rotons then should be incident on , for example , a membrane at the optimum angle to specularly reflect the @xmath0 rotons , see fig.[fig4 ] , as this will give the largest momentum transfer .",
    "the force on the membrane should be outwards .",
    "the created @xmath0 rotons have the same energy as the @xmath131-phonons , about @xmath132 k. at @xmath133 50 mk both the @xmath131-phonons and the @xmath0 rotons propagate ballistically ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a fraction of the energy in the h - phonon beam is transferred to the @xmath0 rotons with probability @xmath134 .",
    "this is predicted ( see @xcite ) , to reach @xmath135 at normal incidence ( for @xmath136 ) , and decrease slowly with increasing angle , so that at @xmath137 it is still about @xmath138 .",
    "the concentration ratio of the rotons in the reflected beam @xmath139 to the phonons in the incident beam @xmath140 is given by @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the incidence and reflection angles , @xmath144 and @xmath145 group velocities of the quasiparticles at @xmath136 .",
    "the angles are related through a modification of snell s law @xmath146 , where @xmath147 are the phase velocities of phonons and @xmath0 roton at energy @xmath136 .",
    "the pressure @xmath148 , which is created by the @xmath0 roton pulse acting on the interface , when incident at angle @xmath149 to the normal @xmath150 , is determined by @xmath151 from eq .",

    "( [ pi3d ] ) , @xmath153 depends strongly on the explicit functions @xmath54 , as the reflection of other types of quasiparticles reduces the negative force .",
    "so the transfer of negative momentum reaches its maximum value when only @xmath0 rotons are reflected , with no phonons or @xmath1 rotons .",
    ". it appears ( see @xcite ) , that there is a range of incidence angles where @xmath155 is nearly unity , and @xmath156 nearly zero , see inset of fig.[fig4 ] .",

    "for @xmath164 we obtain from ( [ pexpq ] ) that @xmath165 . so due to the negative pressure of the @xmath103 rotons the membrane should bend in the direction towards the incident beam , and a sharp peak of the curvature exists around angles @xmath166 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "we have derived the pressure of the gas of superfluid helium quasiparticles on an interface immersed in helium .",
    "the processes of quasiparticles mode change on the interface are considered self - consistently in a general way .",
    "the contributions to the pressure , due to phonons , @xmath0 rotons , and @xmath1 rotons , in thermodynamic equilibrium ( [ pi3d ] ) are found .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath0 rotons is shown to be negative ( [ p23appr ] ) .",

    "can be expressed in the form of the pressure of a classical gas ( [ pclass ] ) , despite the fact that quasiparticles interact with the interface in a much more complex manner .",
    "this result should hold true for any two adjacent continuous media , as the explicit forms for the probabilities , of relevant processes , do not appear in the expression for the pressure .",
    "one of the consequences is that the net force , which the quasiparticles of both media exert on the interface , is directed towards the medium with the greater sound velocity of the two .",
    "this inbalance of pressure , due to the quasiparticles , is compensated by elastic forces which leads to the liquid being under tension at the saturated vapour pressure .",
    "it is shown that the pressure of quasiparticles is that which underlies the fountain effect in helium ( [ dp ] ) .",
    "so the fountain effect is due to the osmotic pressure of the quasiparticles that are  in solution \" in the superfluid .",
