    "transverse _ to the track , the @xmath50-coordinate , or _",
    "normal _ to the track , the @xmath51-coordinate .",
    "hence the basic model implies the existence of _ substeps _ , say , of magnitude @xmath52 between successive mechanochemical states  @xcite .",
    "however , the great majority of these mechanical displacements will be _ hidden _ by noise and so _",
    "unobservable_. this is the crucial issue .",
    "the evidence ( in particular for kinesin  @xcite ) reveals the existence of one principal or * major mechanical substep * of magnitude @xmath53 that corresponds to a specific transition @xmath54 for a _ forward _ or @xmath10 _ step_. such a unique forward - step is sometimes called a `` power stroke '' .",
    "then , clearly , within the basic model a back - step ( @xmath11 ) corresponds to the specific transition @xmath55 .",
    "for simplicity we will initially suppose that there is _ only one _ such single , well defined and observable principal mechanical transition in the processive reaction cycle : it will be referred to as a * major transition * while all other smaller , unobservable displacements , presumed `` hidden , '' will be termed _",
    "substeps_.    it is of interest , all the same , to analyze situations in which , within the full cycle , there are a number of _ visible _ ( or observable ) _ substeps_. indeed , an initial substep large enough to be readily observable was predicted for myosin v by kolomeisky and fisher  @xcite on the basis of dwell - time data obtained at different [ atp ] and force levels  @xcite ; it was later observed unambiguously by uemura et al  @xcite .",
    "thus , in sec .  [",
    "sec : level5 ] below , the case of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) distinct major substeps is considered explicitly  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since most of the forward and reverse transitions , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , are _ not _ observable , one does _ not _ know ( and _ can not _ tell ) the ( bio)chemical ( sub)state of the motor _ during an observed dwell time _ , @xmath60 , between steps @xmath61 and @xmath62 : see ( [ defdwelltimes ] ) .",
    "indeed , the biochemical state will change as time progresses and not necessarily in a uniform sense , e.g. , atp might bind and then be released ( or unbind ) without undergoing a hydrolysis step .",
    "for this _ crucial reason _ once the basic model has @xmath5 or more states the expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 in terms of the basic rates @xmath24 and @xmath25 _ can not be trivial _  and the same goes for the splitting or backwards and forwards probabilities @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the basic theoretical problem is thus to find _ explicit expressions _ for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and for the _ partial dwell times _ as well as for _ conditional _ or _ pairwise _ stepping fractions , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath27 , and dwell times , @xmath3 , @xmath65 , @xmath27 , that it is natural to introduce ( as seen below ) .",
    "indeed , it is clear that these general statistical concepts are not restricted to linear or translocational motors , on which we have focussed ; in fact , they apply equally to _",
    "rotary stepping motors _ like f@xmath66-atpase  @xcite , f@xmath66f@xmath67-atpase  @xcite , and bacterial flagellar motors  @xcite .",
    "however , since , in these respects , kinesin and myosin v have been studied more extensively , we will retain the language appropriate for processive motor proteins walking on linear tracks .    in previous theoretical studies",
    "@xcite splitting probabilities and conditional mean dwell times have been introduced in the context of molecular motors _ via _ the following definitions ( which are distinguished from those used in the discussion above by haceks ) specifically : @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the probabilities that a motor starting at a well defined physical site @xmath70 along the track in the binding state @xmath71 $ ] will arrive at the next site @xmath72 or back at the previous site @xmath73 ( in both cases in state @xmath71 $ ] ) without having undergone the opposite transition to complete a full backward or forward cycle , respectively .",
    "then , similarly , @xmath74 are the average times a motor spends at site @xmath70 ( starting at @xmath75 ) before completing a full forward or backward cycle to site @xmath76 ( in state @xmath71 $ ] ) . exact results for such statistics can be derived by mapping into a markov renewal process  @xcite .    with these definitions",
    "the explicit formulae obtained  @xcite for @xmath77 and @xmath78 correspond to a _ full mechanochemical cycle _ during which a complete forward or backward step is certainly taken .",
    "however , the resulting expressions can be applied to the analysis of experimental stepping data _ only if _",
    "these data allow one to identify each full cycle .",
    "if , instead , the observed noise hides one or more of the @xmath79 biochemical or mechanochemical substeps , while only major mechanical transitions are detectible , one _ can not _ in general decide unambiguously whether a motor executed the detectable steps ( or power strokes ) with or without completing a full cycle . in such cases , the previous expressions can not be applied to account for the observed step fractions and dwell times @xmath80 and @xmath81 . instead",
    ", the results must be modified to allow for the ambiguity arising from the hidden substeps .",
    "it transpires , as we show below , that this rather subtle and at first - sight inconsequential small difference actually leads to significant changes in the load dependence especially ( but not exclusively ) when the fractions of back - steps and forward - steps are similar in frequency , i.e. , on approaching stall conditions when the velocity , @xmath12 , becomes small relative to its load - free value  @xcite .        to clarify the issues involved ,",
    "suppose the cycle has four states ( @xmath82 ) and the major transition occurs between states @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) .",
    "then in stepping time series such as illustrated in figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , one can identify all the moments of time at which the motor leaves state @xmath83 and reaches state @xmath84 on moving forwards or when it leaves state @xmath84 for state @xmath83 on moving backwards .",
    "when successive forward steps are realized , as illustrated in  fig .",
    "1(a ) , one knows that the motor must pass through the remaining two states , @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 , at some points between the major transitions [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] because state @xmath86 can not otherwise be reached _ following _ state @xmath87 at the same site @xmath70 .",
    "thus in a sequence of three successive @xmath10 steps one can conclude that the middle step is associated with a complete ( forward ) cycle .",
    "the corresponding observations are equally true for successive back steps . on the other hand , when the overall stepping sequence encompasses _ both _ back - steps _ and _ forward - steps , which is the interesting ( and usual ) situation [ see fig .  1(b ) ] , it is _ impossible _",
    ", for example , to be sure that the motor has completed a full forward cycle when a ( detectable ) forward step is followed by a back step ; likewise , one can not tell if a full back cycle was completed .",
    "in such cases , the full - cycle assumption is not valid .",
    "the full - cycle assumption can be inadequate even when only a run of forward steps is seen , as in fig .",
    "1(a ) , in that back steps may merely be infrequent .",
    "this is somewhat counterintuitive since one might well argue that each @xmath10 step does then correspond to a full cycle .",
    "however , if the enzymatic cycle is reversible there is always the possibility of a completed back step ; thus explicit expressions in terms of the basic rates @xmath88 will differ when potentially hidden substeps are allowed for .",
    "never - the - less , as we demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : level4 ] , there are various cases in which the quantitative differences may be small .    to demonstrate further the consequences of different conceivable interpretations , consider an ( @xmath89)-state motor with two possible substeps .",
    "1(c ) illustrates a stepping series with a relatively high noise level so that only the major transitions , say @xmath90 for @xmath91 , at times @xmath92 ( with the corresponding dwell times @xmath93 ) can be measured . on the other hand , fig.1(d )",
    "shows _ exactly the same _ series of steps , but with a much lower noise level revealing the previously obscured small substeps , @xmath18_l\\rightleftharpoons(1)_l$ ] and @xmath94_{l+1}$ ] . in the latter case",
    ", one can determine the times @xmath95 when the motor reaches the bound state @xmath18_l$ ] for the first time ( i.e. , when a cycle is completed ) .",
    "and then one can reliably determine the number @xmath96 of full forward , and @xmath97 of full backward _ cycles_. in general , when both forward- and back - steps are present the mean values of the cycle times @xmath98 ( and so @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ) are quite different from the mean step - to - step dwell times @xmath102 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , that one can obtain from the noisy stepping series in fig.1(c ) .",
    "the difference between the splitting probabilities , @xmath103 and @xmath80 , is even more obvious .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "1(d ) one has _ only _",
    "one back cycle since one must not consider the major transitions at times @xmath104 and @xmath105 as indicating full stepping cycles because the motor never actually reached the next bound state @xmath18 $ ] : hence from this sequence one should estimate @xmath106 and @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "conversely in fig .",
    "1(c ) one would count 6 forward and 2 back steps ( or to be more precise , major transitions ) leading to the estimates @xmath109 and @xmath110 so that @xmath111 .    from a mathematical viewpoint , although most of the transitions and biomechanochemical states remain unseen , there is one bright spot !",
    "specifically , in light of the basic feature or model assumption embodied in eq .",
    "( [ basicmodel ] ) , at the instant of time before the moment , say @xmath92 , at which a @xmath10 step occurs , one can be _ sure _ the motor was in state ( @xmath112 ) while in the _ instant _ just _ after _ @xmath92 the motor is in state ( @xmath113 ) ; and , likewise , just _ before a backward _ ( @xmath11 ) _ step _ the state ( @xmath113 ) is occupied , while just _",
    "after _ a back - step the state ( @xmath112 ) is definitely occupied .",
    "together with the standard markovian premise of chemical kinetics , namely , that once in a well defined chemical state the subsequent departures are independent of the mode of arrival , this crucial observation enables the systematic calculation of splitting probabilities and conditional dwell times for general @xmath79 via the _ theory of first passage times : _ specifically , as we now explain , we may use the analysis as formulated by van kampen  @xcite .",
    "before undertaking explicit calculations to obtain expressions for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath1 , @xmath2 , in terms of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 for general @xmath0 and @xmath112 , we introduce some further statistical properties that are straightforward to observe experimentally and might prove mechanistically informative . at the same time , they enter naturally in to the first - passage analysis that is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : level3 ] .",
    "in addition to the prior dwell times defined in  ( [ priordwelltimes ] ) one may _ separately _ observe _ post dwell times _ by measuring intervals _ following after _ @xmath10 or @xmath11 major steps : we will label the corresponding mean dwell times @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where the subscript @xmath116 is read as ` diamond ' and denotes , here and below , a @xmath10 _ or _ a @xmath11 step . however , such dwell times may be _ truncated _ by _ detachments _ ( or dissociations or disconnections ) in which the motor leaves the track ( essentially irreversibly ) so ending a run .",
    "the _ rates of detachment from states _ @xmath48 , say @xmath117 , can certainly be included in the basic sequential kinetic model  @xcite ; but in the _ first instance _ they may be _ neglected _ provided , as we will suppose , only time intervals between observed @xmath10 or @xmath11 mechanical steps are considered .",
    "( their effects , however , would be significant if dwell times _ prior to detachments or immediately following attachments _ were considered which might , indeed , prove informative . )    neglecting such `` initial '' and `` final '' dwell times ( although the former have been examined by veigel _",
    "et al . _ for myosin",
    "v in seeking _",
    "observable _ mechanical substeps  @xcite ) one may still observe the _ four distinct conditional mean dwell times _ : @xmath118 defined , as in  ( [ priordwelltimes ] ) , in terms of the observed intervals @xmath119 , averaged over @xmath120 pairs of successive @xmath10 steps , and likewise for @xmath121 pairs of @xmath10 steps followed by @xmath11 steps , etc .",
    "another aspect is to note that for realistic runs of limited length , deviations of order @xmath122 will arise .",
    "thus , for example , for a run of length @xmath42 _ starting _ with a @xmath10 step the overall mean dwell time is given by @xmath123/(n-1),\\label{taucorrection1}\\ ] ] there being only @xmath124 measurable ( prior ) dwell times @xmath125 .",
    "using the definitions ( [ stepsplprob ] ) then yields @xmath126 in fitting asymptotic ( @xmath127 ) expressions to real data from finite runs such systematic deviations should be recognized . here",
    ", however , we will neglect such finite-@xmath36 or end - effects .    to proceed further",
    "it is also helpful to introduce the _ pairwise step probabilities _ @xmath128 and @xmath129 defined as the probability that a @xmath10 step is followed by a @xmath10 or , respectively , by a @xmath11 step , and likewise , @xmath64 and @xmath130 .",
    "these then satisfy @xmath131    again , in a finite run of @xmath36 steps one can divide the @xmath132 successive pairs into @xmath120 of @xmath10 steps followed by a @xmath10 step , and so on , and use @xmath133 , @xmath134 , etc . noting that in a given run one must have @xmath135 , and neglecting finite-@xmath36 corrections , leads to the valuable relation @xmath136 from this follows the connections @xmath137 @xmath138 together with  ( [ pairwisesplnorm ] ) these relations show that the pair @xmath129 and @xmath64 or , equivalently , @xmath63 and @xmath130 serve to determine all the back / forward or splitting probabilities .",
    "it is worthwhile to carry these considerations a stage further by recognizing the markovian character of the basic @xmath0-state model  ( [ basicmodel ] ) .",
    "thus , neglecting detachments , the four division or splitting probabilities @xmath63 , @xmath129 , @xmath64 , and @xmath130 satisfying  ( [ pairwisesplnorm ] ) can be regarded as the elements of a @xmath139 stepping matrix , @xmath140 $ ] , that stochastically determines the transitions from one ( major ) step , @xmath10 or @xmath11 , to the next . by virtue of the conservation of probability ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue is @xmath141 but the second eigenvalue , which determines the decay per step of step - step correlations , is just @xmath142 this vanishes when @xmath143 which corresponds to @xmath144 and hence , to _ stall conditions _ in which the mean velocity , @xmath12 , vanishes .",
    "counting arguments similar to those yielding  ( [ taucorrection1])-([valuablerelation ] ) also lead to relations for the conditional mean dwell times . for completeness and consistency with later expressions ,",

    "by observing such further independent statistical parameters one can test the basic theory more completely and hope to obtain more reliable and constrained fitting values for the rates determining the full mechanochemical cycle .    at a more detailed level it is also useful to define @xmath150 and @xmath151 with @xmath152 , as the mean number of hidden forward and backward transitions , possibly hidden , from states @xmath48 and @xmath153 , respectively , in the intervals between ( major ) steps _",
