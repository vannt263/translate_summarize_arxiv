    "accordingly , our so - called _ x - heuristic _ , estimates the gm - concurrence of an arbitrary @xmath0-qubit density matrix by applying a lu - transformation that minimizes the entries out of its main- and anti - diagonals and , subsequently , outputting the gm - concurrence of the associated x - density matrix ( obtained by neglecting any entry that may have remained out of the main- and anti - diagonals of the lu - transformed density matrix ) .    in order to illustrate the strengths and drawbacks of the x - heuristic",

    "our comparative analysis reveals the x - heuristic as a useful computational tool for gm - concurrence estimation in multiqubit systems .    as side results , while assessing the x - heuristic with the steady states of the driven dicke model at zero temperature , we provide the first characterization of multipartite entanglement in this model .",
    "in particular , we note that our estimates agree on that gm - entanglement is maximal for the parameter values corresponding roughly to a bifurcation of a fixed point in the corresponding semiclassical dynamics , reinforcing the long - standing ( and widely - accepted ) conjecture that multipartite entanglement must be maximal at quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",

    "detection of gm - entanglement has been intensely studied ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "for this reason , aiming to build the most efficient implementation of the two schemes , we employed the bfgs algorithm for both .    in order to compare the performance of the two schemes in producing reasonable estimates of gm - concurrence , we set a threshold equal to the x - estimates presented in figs .",

    "[ fig : time ] reveals a significant advantage of the x - heuristic over the optimal-@xmath1 scheme , especially for the larger values of @xmath0 . for @xmath110 , for example , the x - heuristic estimates were produced in roughly @xmath161  s , whereas the optimal-@xmath1 scheme was unable to reach the threshold once , even after a week ( approximately @xmath162  s ) of computation .",

[",
    "fig : time ] implies that we are much more likely to obtain a better estimate with the x - heuristic than with the optimal-@xmath1 scheme , which may have converged to a lesser estimate ( or even have not converged at all ) .",
    "naturally , time constraints like this become virtually more important as @xmath0 increases .",
    "in this paper we introduced a heuristic method for estimating the gm - concurrence of an @xmath0-qubit density matrix .",
    "it consists of evaluating the @xmath0-qubit x - state gm - concurrence formula for density matrices that are not of the x - form , but were previously brought `` as close as possible '' to it with a lu transformation .",
    "we have shown that the estimates thus produced are lower bounds on the gm - concurrence by demonstrating that they actually lower bound a standard lower bound on the gm - concurrence ( attainable via a numerical procedure which we refer to as the `` optimal-@xmath1 '' method ) .",
    "most importantly , by examining two prominent families of mixed @xmath0-qubit states , we found that our estimates are usually very close to those produced by the optimal-@xmath1 scheme and are significantly easier to be numerically computed and , in certain cases of high symmetry , can be analytically obtained .",
    "as for future directions , let us mention two possible extensions of the present work .",
    "first , it would be interesting to evaluate the performance of the x - heuristic in other well - established families of @xmath0-qubit mixed states such as reduced ground states of spin chain models . as a matter of fact , it is fair to say that the x - heuristic has already been successfully applied in this context , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the genuine tripartite concurrence of the reduced ground state of three spins symmetrically distributed in the cluster - ising model was exactly calculated thanks to the fact that such states can be turned into x - states via lu transformations .",
    "nevertheless , the application of our heuristic in alike models for which the x - form is not exactly attainable is yet to be explored and is likely to provide an efficient tool for gm - entanglement estimation in condensed matter systems .",
    "second , the requirement of approximating the x - form via lu transformations is unnecessarily strong for the goal of preserving gm - concurrence .",
    "in fact , it was recently conjectured that a generic two - qubit density matrix can always be turned into a x - density matrix of same entanglement via a unitary transformation that is not necessarily local  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this conjecture was rigourously proved for three entanglement measures and , moreover , a semi - analitic prescription for constructing the corresponding `` entanglement - preserving - unitaries '' was delineated . along the same lines",
    ", it would be interesting to characterize the most general family of `` gm - concurrence - preserving - unitaries '' and attempt to approximate the x - form via conjugation with elements of this less constrained family .",
    "in that case , better x - form approximations should be expected , presumably improving the quality of the resulting gm - concurrence estimates .",
    "of course , this new optimization problem may be less suitable for numerical implementation , in which case the trade - off between efficiency and accuracy should be carefully reconsidered .",
