    "in recent years there is a growing interest in the field of spin based electronic devices .",
    "there has been a lot of study in this field after the proposal of the spin field effect transistor by datta and das @xcite .",
    "the charge carriers carry spin in addition to their charges .",
    "the ultimate goal of this field is to control the spin degree of freedom of the charge carriers to produce and detect spin - polarized current in semiconductor nanostructures @xcite .",
    "one can develop device technology @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite in future on the basis of the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the coupling between intrinsic spin of an electron with its orbital angular momentum constitutes the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in low - dimensional semiconducting systems . particularly , there are two kind of soi present in low - dimensional semiconductor structures .",
    "one is the rashba @xcite spin - orbit interaction ( rsoi ) and another is the dresselhaus @xcite spin - orbit interaction ( dsoi ) .",
    "the rsoi arises mainly from the inversion asymmetry of the confining potential in semiconductor heterojunctions .",
    "the strength of rsoi is proportional to the electric field externally applied which can be tuned by an external bias @xcite or internally generated due to the crystal potentials . on the other hand dsoi",
    "is present in bulk materials and semiconductor heterostructures which lack bulk inversion symmetry .",
    "the form of dsoi term strongly depends on the growth direction of semiconductor quantum well ( qw ) @xcite .",
    "the strength of dsoi depends on properties of the material and the crystal structure .    in 1930",
    ", erwin schrodinger @xcite predicted that a free particle described by the relativistic dirac equation will perform an oscillatory motion which is known as the @xmath4 ( zb ) .",
    "the free relativistic dirac particle has two energy branches : @xmath5 .",
    "it is well understood that this oscillatory motion results from the interference between these two energy branches @xcite .",
    "the large oscillation frequency @xmath6 hz and the small oscillation amplitude @xmath7 m is not accessible to the modern experimental techniques .",
    "most of the studies on the zb of electrons used plane waves to describe the electrons .",
    "it was pointed out by lock @xcite that plane wave is not a localized state and therefore , rapid oscillations on the average position of a plane wave has some limitations .",
    "he also demonstrated that when an electron is described by a wave packet , the zb oscillation has a transient character .    in 2005 , zawadzki et al .",
    "@xcite studied zb in narrow gap semiconductor ( ngs ) by using the analogy between @xmath8 theory of the energy bands in ngs and the free dirac relativistic equation for electrons .",
    "they found much more favorable amplitude and frequency of the oscillation than those in a vacuum for a free electron . at the same time , schliemann et al .",
    "@xcite has studied the zb of an electron in iii - v zincblende semiconductor qws in the presence of the soi thoroughly .",
    "the above studies initiated intense theoretical research on the zb of electrons in various condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "the proposal of an experimental scheme for observing zb in ultra - cold @xcite atomic gases is also given .",
    "the trembling motion was proposed for photons in a two - dimensional photonic crystal and for ramsey interferometry @xcite .",
    "it was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that an acoustic analog of zb in a macroscopic two - dimensional sonic crystal was observed .",
    "a general theory of zb of a multi - band hamiltonian is studied by david and cserti @xcite .",
    "recently , vaseghi @xcite et al . studied the effect of an external perpendicular magnetic field on the zb for both quantum wire and quantum dot within the two - sub - band model .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath9 dictates whether the motion will be oscillatory or not .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "[ 14 ] that the motion will be oscillatory when @xmath10 .",
    "it was also shown that the zb vanishes when the strengths of the rsoi and dsoi are equal .",
    "this is due to an additional conserved quantity .    in this work we study effect of the in - plane magnetic field on the zb of electrons in a semiconductor qw and in a qd with the rashba and dresselhaus soi .",
    "we obtain an analytical expression of the time - evolution of the position vector of an electron in a qw by using the schrodinger picture .",
    "the advantage of using the schordinger picture is to see the direct relation between the amplitude of the oscillatory motion and the berry connection in momentum space .",
    "we find that in presence of the magnetic field the zb in a quantum well does not vanish even when the strengths of the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions are equal .",
    "the zb in a qw sustains even at very low value of @xmath1 due to the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the trembling motion of an electron in a semiconductor qw with high lande g - factor ( e.g. insb ) sustains over a long time , even at very low value of @xmath1 .",
    "the time - period of the oscillation decreases as the magnetic field strength is increased .",
    "next , we study the zb of an electron in a qd within the two sub - band model numerically .",
    "the trembling motion does not fade away in time even when the magnetic field is absent as well as when the strength of the sois is equal .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the hamiltonian and eigenstates of a 2deg with both type of soi in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field . in section iii , we derive time - evolution of the electron position vector in the schordinger picture .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are given in section v. section vi contains the calculation and result of zb of electrons in a gaas / algaas qd .",
    "the conclusion is presented in section vii .",
    "we consider a 2deg with the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions in presence of an in - plane magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian of this system is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the momentum and the effective mass of an electron , respectively . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are the strengths of the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian is the zeeman term due to the application of the in - plane magnetic field @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the effective lande - g factor and @xmath19 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of the system @xcite are , respectively , given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the spin eigenstates are @xmath23 with @xmath24 .    in absence of the magnetic field ,",
    "a new conserved quantity @xmath25 exists for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the spin eigenstates @xmath27 become independent of the wave vector @xmath28 and therefore the zb does not exist due to the absence of spin randomization @xcite .",
    "the situation is completely different when the in - plane magnetic field is present .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ spinstates ] ) that the spin states are always function of @xmath28 even at @xmath26 as long as @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , spin randomization occurs and we would expect to see the zb which is shown in the next section .",
    "we shall use the schordinger picture to analyze the time - evolution of the electron position vector .",
    "we represent the initial wave function of an electron by a gaussian wave packet with initial spin polarization along the @xmath30 axis as given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 . here",
    ", @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the initial width and the initial wave vector of the wave packet , respectively .",
    "the time - evolution of the initial wave packet in the schordinger representation can be obtained in the usual manner as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the time - evolution operator . after doing some straightforward algebra we obtain , @xmath37\\left(\\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\0 \\end{array}\\right)-e^{i\\theta_k}\\sin[\\omega({\\bf k})t]\\left(\\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\1 \\end{array}\\right)\\big\\},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38/(2\\hbar)$ ] .",

    "( [ zb ] ) indicates the zb .",
    "two important observations can be made by analyzing eq .",
    "( [ zb ] ) . first , the amplitude of the zb is directly proportional to the berry connection @xmath43 .",
    "second , for @xmath44 the amplitude ( or the berry connection ) of the oscillation does not vanish when the in - plane magnetic field is present .",
    "but it vanishes if the magnetic field is absent .    after substituting the expressions for @xmath45 , @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ zb ] ) and considering the initial velocity of the wave packet is along @xmath47-direction ( i.e. @xmath48 ) one can easily obtain the following expressions    @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ zb1 ] ) and ( [ zb2 ] ) one can infer that zb is absent in the limit @xmath56 . on the other hand , as @xmath57 the gaussian approaches to a delta function i.e. @xmath58 and in this limit we find an analytic expression for the zb as given by @xmath59\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath60\\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we also calculate the expectation values of the velocity of electron in @xmath61 and @xmath47 direction .",
    "they are given by    @xmath62    and    @xmath63    here , @xmath64 is the velocity corresponding to the rsoi .",
    "the corresponding currents are simply given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the electronic charge .",
    "( [ zb2 ] ) and ( [ vel2 ] ) tell us that the zb along @xmath47 direction vanishes when in - plane magnetic field and the dsoi are absent simultaneously @xcite because in this case @xmath68 .",
    "but when there is a finite in - plane magnetic field present the zb in @xmath47 direction does not vanish even at @xmath69 .",
    "so this is an effect of the in - plane magnetic field on zb .      in this sub - section",
    "we evaluate time - evolution of the observables position vector and current density for different values of the parameters like magnetic field , @xmath1 , @xmath70 etc . + * gaas / algaas qw * : we consider gaas / algaas quantum well for which the effective lande @xmath71-factor is @xmath72 .",
    "the value of the rashba coefficient is taken to be @xmath73 ev - m .",

    "( [ zb1 ] ) , ( [ zb2 ] ) , ( [ vel1 ] ) and ( [ vel2 ] ) .",
    "here it should be mentioned that eqs .",
    "( [ zb2 ] ) and ( [ zb4 ] ) contain two parts : the first depends linearly on time and the second one is oscillatory in time ( responsible for zb ) .",
    "the magnitude of the first term is very large compared to that of the second one .",
    "so if we plot this as a function of time we will get a straight line due to the dominating first term .",
    "we consider three cases corresponding to three different values of the parameter @xmath70 namely @xmath69 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "for each case we plot @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 for different values of magnetic field in figs .",

    "we define the quantity @xmath81 as @xmath82 . from fig .",
    "[ 1(a ) ] , one can see that the amplitude of the zb increases as the magnetic field increases from its zero value .",
    "it is also noticeable that the zb pattern is more oscillatory with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the current shows ( in figs . [ 1(b),1(c ) ] ) the similar behavior as the position but it oscillates about zero . from figs . [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] we can see that as we increase the value of @xmath70 , the amplitude of zb decreases . one important point is to be noted here that there is a definite phase difference between the currents in @xmath61 and @xmath47 direction when @xmath83 as evident from figs . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] .",
    "but the situation is different when @xmath76 .",
