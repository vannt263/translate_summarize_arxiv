    "perfect isolation of quantum systems is not possible since any realistic system is influenced by the coupling to an environment , which typically has a large number of degrees of freedom . a prototypical physical system illustrating this situation is given by an atom interacting with the surrounding radiation field @xcite .    in general ,",
    "a complete microscopic description of the degrees of freedom of the environment is too complicated .",
    "hence , one has to look for more simple descriptions of the dynamics of the open system . in principle , one should investigate the unitary dynamics of the total system , i.e. system and environment , to obtain informations about the reduced system of interest by averaging the appropriate observables over the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "this is the main concern of the theory of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "applications of the theory of open quantum systems are found in almost all areas of physics , ranging from quantum optics @xcite to solid state physics @xcite , from chemical physics @xcite to nanotechnology @xcite , from quantum information @xcite to spintronics @xcite . on a more fundamental level ,",
    "the theory of open quantum systems is relevant for quantum measurement theory @xcite and for decoherence and the emergence of classicality @xcite .",
    "usually , the dynamics of an open quantum system is described in terms of the reduced density operator which is obtained from the density operator of the total system by tracing over the variables of the environment . in order to eliminate the degrees of freedom of the environment various approximations",
    "are needed which lead to a closed equation of motion for the density matrix of the open system .",
    "the most famous one being the markov approximation which eventually leads to a so - called quantum master equation which , in turn , generates a quantum dynamical semi - group in the space of reduced density matrices @xcite .",
    "prominent representants of such equations are the quantum optical master equation , and , derived under slightly different assumptions , the quantum brownian motion master equation , with applications in condensed matter physics .    for stronger couplings between the system and the environment the finite relaxation time of the environment may significantly influence the dynamics of the open system , making necessary a non - markovian treatment of the reduced system dynamics .",
    "typical examples of such a behaviour arise in condensed matter physics at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "there are several strategies to go beyond a markovian description of open quantum systems .",
    "prominent approaches are provided by the influence functional technique @xcite , the cumulant expansion @xcite and projection operator techniques @xcite .    during the past decade",
    "another approach to the description of open quantum systems has emerged , essentially motivated by the experimental evidence for quantum jumps in simple three - level ions @xcite and similarly in the photon excitation number of a single mode of a high - q cavity @xcite .",
    "the common feature of these experiments is that they can be described within the theory of continuous measurements @xcite . under the condition that the information extracted from the system by the environment is recoverable",
    ", alternative measurement schemes give rise to different stochastic processes for the wave function of the open system @xcite . for example",
    ", the direct photon counting of the light emitted by an excited atom gives rise to a piecewise deterministic process for the wave function of the atom . on this _ selective _ level of description of open quantum systems the typical stochastic processes arising are markovian .",
    "the relation between the _ selective _ wave function approach and the _ non - selective _ density matrix approach is simply stated @xcite : the covariance of the stochastic wave function is the density matrix of the reduced system .",
    "the aim of the paper is to guide the reader in a systematic way through the different levels of description available for the investigation of the dynamics of open quantum systems : density matrix and wave function approaches , selective and non - selective measurements , markovian and non - markovian approximations , quantum optical and quantum brownian motion master equations , linear and non - linear semigroups , piecewise deterministic and diffusive processes for the wave function .",

    "in general terms , an open quantum system is a quantum mechanical system @xmath0 with hilbert space @xmath1 which is coupled to another quantum system @xmath2 , the environment , with hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is a subsystem of the total system @xmath4 living in the tensor product space @xmath5 . sometimes , the surroundings @xmath2 of the open system are termed reservoir to denote an environment with an infinite number of degrees of freedom . if the reservoir is in thermal equilibrium one speaks of a heat bath .",
    "let us denote by @xmath6 the hamiltonian of the open system , by @xmath7 the free hamiltonian of the environment , and by @xmath8 the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the system and the environment .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total system can then be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the identities in the hilbert spaces of the system and of the environment , respectively , and @xmath12 is a coupling constant .",

    "the corresponding differential form of the evolution is obtained from a partial trace over the environment of the von neumann equation , @xmath25.\\ ] ] in the following we will survey the most important approaches and approximations to the above exact equation of motion . to this end",
    "we will first describe the paths starting from the centre of the flow diagram fig .",

    "@xmath34 one immediately obtains an equation of motion for the reduced density matrix of the open system of the form @xmath35 such an equation is called a markovian quantum master equation .",
    "the most general form of the generator @xmath34 is provided by a theorem due to gorini , kossakowski and sudarshan @xcite and by a theorem of lindblad @xcite according to which @xmath36   + \\sum_i \\gamma_i \\left ( a_i \\rho_s a^{\\dagger}_i   - \\frac{1}{2 } a^{\\dagger}_i a_i \\rho_s - \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho_s   a^{\\dagger}_i a_i \\right).\\ ] ] here , @xmath37 is the generator of the coherent part of the evolution ( which need not be identical to the free hamiltonian of the system ) and the @xmath38 are system operators with corresponding relaxation times @xmath39 .",

    "the physical condition behind this approximation is the following one : the time scale @xmath41 of the systematic evolution of the reduced system is small compared to its relaxation time @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "unfortunately , this condition is violated in many physical applications involving stronger couplings and low temperatures .",
    "it occurs that the systematic dynamics of the reduced system may even by slow compared to the correlation time of the environment , that is @xmath45 .",

    "[ fig : microscopictheory ] .",
    "now we go back to the centre of the figure and will explain why it might be necessary to follow the clockwise path from the centre to the right .",
    "in order to extract information from a quantum system a measurement must be carried out .",
    "let us consider the situation that an open system is measured through an indirect measurement on its environment .",
    "thus , the open system is the quantum object to be measured , while the environment plays the role of the quantum probe .",
    "the latter is measured by means of a classical apparatus , once correlations between object and probe system are created as a result of their interaction .",
    "let us assume that the interaction between the open system and the environment begins at time @xmath21 . at this time",
    "the state of the system is characterized by the density matrix @xmath47 and the state of the environment , the quantum probe , is given by @xmath49 the initial density matrix of the total system is thus @xmath50 . at time",
    "@xmath51 a classical measurement apparatus measures the bath observable @xmath52 the spectrum of which is assumed to be discrete and non - degenerate , for simplicity .",
    "the application of the von neumann - lders projection postulate to the classical measuring device shows that the reduced system s state after the measurement is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 in these formulae @xmath57 is the time - development operator of the total system describing the coupled evolution of quantum system and quantum probe . the probability that the measurement outcome is @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 . under the condition that the outcome is @xmath58 , the corresponding transformation of the reduced system s density matrix from the initial state @xmath47 to the new state @xmath60 is provided by the map @xmath61 which is known as a quantum operation . like the dynamical map ( [ dynmap ] ) it represents a convex - linear and completely positive map .",
    "the representation ( [ eq : operation ] ) in terms of the operators @xmath62 takes on the general form required by the representation theorem of quantum operations @xcite .    when writing eq .",
    "( [ indirectselectivemeasure ] ) it is assumed that the measurement is a selective one , i.e. that after the measurement the information on the measurement outcomes is retained . therefore , the original ensemble described by @xmath47 is split into a number of sub - ensembles described by the various @xmath60 , each sub - ensemble being conditioned on a specific outcome @xmath58 . by contrast , in the case of a non - selective measurement the final state of the system after the measurement is given by @xmath63 which describes the ensemble obtained after re - mixing the sub - ensembles after the measurement .",
    "thus , the first important step in the description of an open quantum system is to make clarity about the type of measurement which is performed in order to obtain information about the system . in other words",
    ", we have to know whether the ( indirect ) measurement is selective or not .",
    "the microscopic theory of the total ( closed ) system has to be supplemented with this information as is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : microscopictheory ] .",
    "this important distinction has fundamental consequences on the choice of the formalism required to describe the open system .",
    "in fact , selective and non - selective measurements require different characterizations of the quantum statistical properties of the open system .",
    "let us now follow another important path through the flow diagram .",
    "again we start at the centre of fig .",
    "[ fig : microscopictheory ] and proceed clockwise to the right into the lower part of the diagram .",
    "the decisive aspect of this path is the indirect selective measurement of the open quantum system , which requires a particular characterization of the quantum statistical ensembles .",
    "a quantum statistical ensemble characterized in terms of a density matrix @xmath15 describes a disordered set of a large number of individual quantum systems , where each system has been prepared in one of a certain set of states @xmath64 .",
    "the preparation measurements could have been carried out , for example , through the measurements of complete sets of commuting observables .",
    "the various @xmath64 , however , need not be orthogonal .",
    "a mixture of these states with respective weights @xmath65 gives rise to an ensemble @xmath66 which is described by the density matrix @xmath67    a different kind of ensembles which is appropriate for the description of selective measurements and which will be denoted by @xmath68 is obtained as follows . consider a collection of pure quantum statistical ensembles @xmath69 describable by corresponding states @xmath64 .",
    "we want to keep , as required for a selective measurement , the information that a particular quantum system belongs to a particular ensemble @xmath69 . for this purpose",
    "we take @xmath70 identically prepared copies @xmath71 of @xmath69 for each @xmath72 .",

    "the formalism of probability densities on hilbert space now allows the description of the dynamics of an open system which is continuously monitored through its environment ( see the lower part of the flow diagram shown in fig .  [",

    "the probability density then becomes a time - dependent functional @xmath89 $ ] and the reduced system s state vector provides a stochastic process @xmath90 in hilbert space .",
    "physically , @xmath90 represents the state of the reduced system which is conditioned on a specific readout of the measurement carried out on the environment .",
    "consequently , the stochastic evolution depends on the measurement scheme used to monitor the environment . as an example we write a stochastic differential equation corresponding to the lindblad equation ( [ lindbald ] ) with generator ( [ lindblad - generator ] ) : @xmath91 a stochastic differential equation of this form is known as a piecewise deterministic process .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side describes the deterministic evolution periods given by the non - linear schrdinger equation @xmath92 the deterministic pieces of the motion are interrupted by instantaneous changes of the state vector according to @xmath93 .",
    "these so - called quantum jumps are described by the second term on the right - hand side of eq  ( [ pdp - sdgl ] ) which involves the random numbers @xmath94 .",

    "depending on the measurement scheme , it may be appropriate to perform a diffusion approximation of the above piecewise deterministic process .",
    "this leads to a diffusion process for the wave function of the reduced system involving real or complex wiener noise .",
    "an overview of the markov processes for the wave function of the open system related to a certain continuous measurement scheme is given in fig .",

    "we proceed counter clockwise as indicated in the upper half of the flow diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : microscopictheory ] .",
    "again , the starting point is provided by an underlying microscopic theory for the total system . unlike in the markovian case ,",
    "the first step consists in deriving an exact equation of motion for the reduced density matrix of the open system through an elimination of the dynamical variables of the environment .",
    "of course , a closed analytical expression for the reduced density matrix can be obtained only for a few analytically solvable models , such as for the damped harmonic oscillator and for free brownian motion @xcite . in many interesting cases , however , exact representations for the reduced density matrix serve as starting points of a perturbation expansion in the system - environment coupling and of the development of numerical integration schemes .    as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : microscopictheory ] and in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonmarkovianapproaches ] there are several possibilities to carry out this program .",
    "probably the most prominent one is to use the nakajima - zwanzig projection operator technique @xcite . in this approach one",
    "derives a formally exact equation for the reduced density matrix of the open system in the form of an integro - differential equation involving a certain memory kernel .",
    "the practical disadvantage of this approach is that the perturbation expansion of the memory kernel does not simplify the convolution structure of the equations whose numerical solution could be quite involved ( see also @xcite ) .    as far as a numerical and/or perturbation approach",
    "is concerned a more appropriate strategy is to derive a time - local master equation for the open system s density matrix @xmath28 which takes the form @xmath98 @xmath99 is a time - dependent generator , a super - operator in the reduced system s hilbert space @xmath79 . employing the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) projection operator technique @xcite one can show that a master equation of the form ( [ tcl - master ] ) indeed exists for small and intermediate couplings in the case of factorizing initial conditions .",
    "we remark that a similar method can also be used in the general case of a correlated initial state , in which case the time - local master equation contains an additional inhomogeneous term .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ tcl - master ] ) is local in time , i.  e. that it does not involve an integration over the past history of the reduced system . due to the explicit time - dependence of the tcl generator @xmath99 , however",
    ", it does not lead to a quantum dynamical semigroup and , therefore , the generator need not be in lindblad form .",
    "( [ tcl - master ] ) provides an appropriate starting point for a perturbation expansion with respect to some coupling parameter @xmath12 . to this end , one expands the time - local generator in powers of @xmath12 , @xmath100 and solves the corresponding equation of motion which is obtained in the desired order in @xmath12 either analytically or numerically .",
    "such an expansion may be found in two different ways .",
    "one way is to start from the formal solution of the von neumann equation of the total system and to use an expansion in terms of ordered cumulants @xcite .",
    "another way is to invoke the feynman - vernon influence functional representation of the reduced density matrix @xcite and to obtain an expansion of the generator directly in terms of the influence phase",
    ". both strategies , where applicable , yield identical expansions of the tcl generator @xcite .",
    "the different approaches to the description of the non - markovian dynamics of an open system are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonmarkovianapproaches ] .        in general",
    ", one expects that a time - local master equation whose generator consists of only the first few terms of the expansion provides a good description of the reduced dynamics for weak and moderate couplings .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that an expansion of the form ( [ tcl - expansion ] ) need not exist for strong couplings .",
    "what happens in these cases is that the initial state @xmath27 is not uniquely determined by the state @xmath28 at time @xmath31 .",
    "specific examples of the application of this technique to physical models and of the breakdown of the tcl expansion in the strong coupling regime are discussed in @xcite .    within any given order the time - local master equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath28 which results from the above procedure takes the following form , @xmath101 with some time - dependent linear operators @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this equation is linear in @xmath28 and local in time , but it needs not be in lindblad form .",
    "however , it is important to realize that a stochastic representation of the dynamics given by this equation is possible @xcite .",
    "the key point for a stochastic unraveling of the non - markovian master equation ( [ eq : rho_mo ] ) is the usage of a stochastic process in the doubled hilbert space @xmath106 .",
    "this means that we represent the dynamics through a pair of stochastic wave functions @xmath107 such that @xmath108 becomes a stochastic process in the doubled hilbert space .",
