    "<S> the _ on - shell _ brst is used to mean that the brst transformation is defined by eliminating the nakanishi - lautrup ( nl ) auxiliary field @xmath17 and the brst algebra is closed among the gauge field @xmath18 , ghost field @xmath19 and antighost field @xmath20 without the nl field @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to keep the fact in mind that the auxiliary field @xmath17 does not have the kinetic term .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we point out a transparent physical meaning of the ( on - shell ) brst - invariant composite operator @xmath3 of mass dimension two and its vacuum expectation value , @xmath21 , i.e. , the mixed vacuum condensate of mass dimension two . the on - shell is used to mean that the nl field @xmath17 is eliminated by using the equation of motion ( eom ) for @xmath17 or it is integrated out by gaussian integration in the functional integration . in the on - shell brst transformation @xmath22 , the eoms for the fields </S>",

    "<S> it is easy to show that the action obtained after eliminating the nl field @xmath17 is invariant under the on - shell brst transformation </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the on - shell brst transformation @xmath22 plays the same role in the @xmath17-eliminated action as the off - shell brst transformation @xmath24 in the @xmath17-included action . </S>",
    "<S> an inconvenience of the on - shell brst transformation lies in a fact that the nilpotency is not fully maintained , e.g. , the nilpotency of the on - shell brst transformation for ghost ( antighost ) is satisfied only when the eom for the antighost ( ghost ) is used .    </S>",
    "<S> an apparent advantage of @xmath3 is to be able to incorporate simultaneously two novel vacuum condensates , each of which has independently been proposed recently ; the gluon pair condensation @xmath25 in the lorentz covariant gauge @xcite ( see @xcite for the old works ) and the ghost  antighost condensation @xmath26 in the ma gauge @xcite where the index @xmath27 runs over the off - diagonal components only . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath21 seems to reduce to the gluon condensation @xmath28 in the limit @xmath29 of landau gauge .    </S>",
    "<S> quite recently , the physical meaning of @xmath3 was seriously re - examined @xcite based on the general theory of the brst cohomology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to answer some of the criticisms raised there without using the abstract theory of brst cohomology by pointing out a transparent physical meaning of @xmath3 .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we argue    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the requirement of on - shell brst invariance for @xmath3 , i.e , @xmath30 is equivalent to the gauge invariance for @xmath31 , i.e , @xmath32 . </S>",

    "<S> 3 .   the gauge invariant operator @xmath31 is nonlocal and can be non - linear in the non - abelian gauge theory .    by _ local _ , </S>",
    "<S> it is meant that the functional depends on the fields and a finite number of their derivatives all of which are evaluated at the same point in spacetime . in this sense , the transverse and longitudinal modes of the gauge field are nonlocal objects .    moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the operator @xmath3 is invariant under the sl(2,r ) transformation generated by the brst charge @xmath35 , the anti - brst charge @xmath36 and the ghost number charge @xmath37 which constitute the extended becchi - rouet - stora - nakanishi - ojima ( brsno ) algebra @xcite in the generalized lorentz gauge @xcite and the modified ma gauge @xcite .    in order to illustrate the validity of the above claims , we begin with the free abelian gauge theory . in the abelian gauge theory , </S>",

    "<S> the pair condensation does not occur , since there is no interaction between gauge bosons . in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , </S>",
    "<S> such interaction is provided by the fermion loop . in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) </S>",
    "<S> , the gluon self - interaction can do the same job . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the interaction can be incorporated by perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> in the asymptotic region , the above argument given for the abelian gauge theory can be extended to the non - abelian gauge theory simply by replacing the fields @xmath96 in the abelian gauge theory above with the asymptotic fields @xmath97 with an adjoint index @xmath98 in the non - abelian gauge theory , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this framework is sufficient to discuss the scattering process in which the initial two transverse gauge bosons are scattered into the final two transverse gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath99 are members of the quartet for each adjoint index @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> any quartet members can not be detected in the physical subspace @xmath100 of positive semi - definite , because they can appear there only in zero - norm combination ( quartet mechanism ) .    in the non - abelian case </S>",
    "<S> , however , the explicit construction of the transverse mode is rather difficult , although it was attempted in the framework of perturbation theory up to the order @xmath101 @xcite : @xmath102 which reduces to ( [ at ] ) in the abelian limit . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath103 is transverse @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be obtained in such a way that @xmath103 is both brst invariant , @xmath106 , and gauge invariant , @xmath107 , order by order of the coupling constant @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms are @xmath109 and @xmath110 + { 1 \\over 2}[\\partial^j v_{(1 ) } , v_{(1 ) } ]    $ ] where @xmath111 , see section 5 and appendix a of @xcite for more details . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can not prove the statement ( [ decomp ] ) in the non - abelian case , except for the asymptotic fields . </S>",
    "<S> rather , it will be rather difficult to perform this program beyond the perturbation theory because of the existence of the gribov horizon , see @xcite and references therein for related works .    according to the standard argument of brst cohomology </S>",
    "<S> , there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the brst cohomology at zero ghost number and the set of classical physical observables , i.e. , gauge invariant functional of the gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the classical physical observable to which the mixed vacuum condensate corresponds is the gauge - invariant dimension 2 operator , i.e. , the transverse gauge boson pair , which is however nonlocal . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an advantage of the mixed condensate proposed in @xcite is clear ; the local and on - shell brst invariant operator avoids the nonlocality and plays in the gauge - fixed formulation the same role as the gauge - invariant operator for any covariant gauge . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding classical observable is invariant not only for the residual set of gauge transformation preserving the lorentz condition , but also for the full gauge group @xmath7 , contrary to the claim @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the physical meaning of the vev @xmath21 is now clear ; the vev measures the transverse gluon pair condensation @xmath86 due to attractive force generated by gluon self - interactions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the ghost - antighost condensation is not brst invariant , but ghost and antighost are necessary to cancel the unphysical degrees of freedom corresponding to the longitudinal ( spacelike ) and scalar ( timelike ) modes of the gauge boson . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> ghost condensation is indispensable to convert the non - local operator @xmath31 to the local one @xmath3 by adding unphysical degrees of freedom , which is easier to deal with . </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , the operator @xmath31 is off - shell brst closed . </S>",
    "<S> but the operator @xmath3 can not be extendable to the off - shell brst closed alternative , in agreement with @xcite .    according to the theory of observables in yang - mills theory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath103 is the observable in the strongest sense , i.e. , @xmath112=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this implies @xmath113 , i.e. , @xmath114 for nonlocal operator @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the norm must be non - negative , i.e. , @xmath116 , which will lead to @xmath117 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the gluon pair condensation was measured on a lattice and it was found that the condensation was saturated by the contribution from the instanton configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the instanton is the solution of the self - dual equation and minimizes the euclidean action . </S>",
    "<S> it is a semi - classical configuration of the gauge field specified by the collective coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the solution obtained under the ansatz @xmath118 using the ( anti ) self - dual t hooft tensor @xmath119 is automatically transverse @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the numerical result @xcite is consistent with the claim in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> within the effective potential for the composite operator to three loop order , on the other hand , the mixed condensate in the landau gauge @xmath121 was calculated in the perturbation theory @xcite and it was attempted to extend to arbitrary @xmath13 @xcite , provided that the vacuum satisfies the translation invariance .    finally , it is straightforward to extend the above operator to the ma gauge @xcite and the general lorentz non - covariant gauges @xcite that include the coulomb gauge as a limiting cases @xcite . </S>"
