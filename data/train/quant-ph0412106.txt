    "the einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) paradox stems from a famous paper published in @xmath1  @xcite , which showed that local realism is not consistent with quantum mechanical completeness . a direct and feasible demonstration of the epr paradox with continuous variables",

    "generally , such a device may be considered as either a single nonlinear crystal pumped by two spatially separated lasers , or two waveguides with a @xmath0 component .",
    "we calculate phase - dependent correlations between the two low frequency outputs of the cavity in the below threshold regime , showing that this system exhibits a wide range of behaviour and is potentially an easily tunable source of single - mode squeezing , entangled states and states which exhibit the epr paradox .",
    "the spatial separation of the output modes means that they do not have to be separated by optical devices before measurements can be made , along with the unavoidable losses which would result from this procedure .",
    "the entangled beams produced can be degenerate in both frequency and polarisation , unlike those of the nondegenerate opo , and would exit the cavity at spatially separated locations .",
    "these correlations are tunable by controlling some of the operational degrees of freedom of the system , including the evanescent couplings between the two waveguides , the input power and the cavity detunings .",
    "the term nonlinear coupler was given to a system of two coupled waveguides without an optical cavity by perina _",

    "generically , the device consists of two parallel optical waveguides which are coupled by an evanescent overlap of the guided modes .",
    "the quantum statistical properties of this device when the nonlinearity is of the @xmath2 type have been theoretically investigated , predicting energy transfer between the waveguides  @xcite and the generation of correlated squeezing  @xcite .",
    "coupled @xmath0 downconversion processes in the travelling wave configuration have also been examined theoretically , predicting that light produced in one of the media can be controlled by light entering the other  @xcite , and that such a device can produce entanglement of the output beams  @xcite .",

    "additional potential advantages are the reductions in threshold pump power and phase noise , relative to current practise .",
    "another potential advantage as compared to the normal type ii polarisation nondegenerate opo lies in the difficulty of stabilising this device at frequency degeneracy  @xcite .",

    "we note here that , unlike the single opo case with a resonant cavity , the threshold pumping is not a constant for fixed cavity loss rates , but is a function of the coupling strengths between the two waveguides . using the below threshold solutions , we may calculate any desired time normally - ordered spectral correlations inside the cavity using the simple formula @xmath53 after which we use the standard input - output relations  @xcite to relate these to quantities which may be measured outside the cavity .",

    "our coupled system would be expected to exhibit the above values in the limit as @xmath64 , which provides a standard for comparison with the analytical results . in the general case , we find that @xmath65 , as expected .",
    "we also find that the coupling means that the intracavity high frequency field is no longer real , but has a phase given by @xmath66 .",

    "the choice of detunings shown has the possible disadvantage that , as the effective coupling is now only in the @xmath132 mode , which is moved away from resonance , the quantum correlations which depend on both the modes are slightly degraded .",

    "the tunability that exists because of the number of different parameters which can be experimentally accessed , such as the coupling strength , the pump intensity and the detunings , may make it interesting for a range of potential applications which would require the availability of states of the electromagnetic field with varying degrees of nonclassicality . since this type of system is compatible with integrated optics techniques , it may provide a more robust source of entanglement than interferometers that use discrete optical components .",
