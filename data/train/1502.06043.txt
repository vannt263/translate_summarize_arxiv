    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are the final products of many stars with masses below @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "this evolutionary stage occurs after the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , if the star reaches a temperature high enough to ionize the circumstellar gas ( the agb external envelope ejected through a stellar wind ) before it dilutes into the interstellar medium .",
    "the ionized gas contains valuable information on the nucleosynthesis processes occurring inside the agb stars ( because some elements are produced in the interior of these stars and then carried to the surface ) and on the chemical composition of the environment where the star was born ( since other elements remain unchanged during the life of the star ) .",
    "the chemical abundances in pne can be compared with the ones computed using the same techniques in h@xmath0ii regions in order to obtain information not only about the efficiency of stellar nucleosynthesis and dredge - up processes but also about the development of chemical evolution in different galaxies .",
    "the oxygen abundance has been traditionally used as a proxy for the metallicity in ionized nebulae because oxygen is the element for which more reliable abundances can be obtained .",
    "bright emission lines from two of its ionization states , @xmath4  and @xmath5 , can be easily measured in optical spectra , and the correction for the contribution of higher ionization states is large only for pne of very high excitation . however , agb stars can modify the oxygen abundance via two mechanisms .",
    "the third dredge - up ( tdu ) is a mixing event that transports to the stellar surface material created by he burning and the _ s_-process .",
    "the material is heavily enriched in carbon but also has some oxygen ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , hot bottom burning ( hbb ) occurs in the most massive progenitors and consists in the penetration of the bottom of the convective envelope into a region where the temperature is sufficient to activate the cno - cycle , which can destroy oxygen ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the products are then conveyed to the surface .",
    "the efficiencies of the tdu and hbb depend on the initial mass of the star and on its metallicity , and the predictions differ from model to model . for example ,",
    "standard nucleosynthesis models with no extra mixing processes , such as those of @xcite , do not predict a significant production of oxygen at solar or half solar metallicity .",
    "however , models that include diffusive convective overshooting , like those computed by @xcite and @xcite , predict a significant production of oxygen , even at solar metallicities .",
    "this mixing mechanism was first introduced by @xcite and causes the convective envelope to penetrate more deeply into the star and , in combination with an efficient third dredge up , leads to an increase of the oxygen abundance for stars between 1.5 m@xmath6  and 3 m@xmath6 .",
    "there are other mechanisms that can produce extra mixing , such as rotation , magnetic fields , and thermohaline mixing ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these mechanisms are not well understood , but reliable determinations of the chemical composition of ionized nebulae might help us to constrain their efficiencies .",
    "observationally , claims of oxygen production in low mass stars have been restricted to low metallicity pne ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found an overabundance of oxygen in nearby pne of near - solar metallicity when they compared them with local h@xmath0ii regions , but a detailed analysis of the clues provided by other elements is required in order to ascertain the cause of this overabundance .",
    "on the other hand , the agb models of @xcite and @xcite do not predict a significant destruction of oxygen for metallicities above @xmath7 , but the models of @xcite with @xmath8 show that o / h can decrease by @xmath90.2 dex for stars with masses @xmath10 m@xmath6 , and this effect could also be more important at lower metallicities ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "other elements whose abundances we can derive and use as proxies for nebular metallicities are sulfur , neon , chlorine and argon . however , these elements require corrections for the contribution of unobserved ions to their total abundances , the so - called ionization correction factors ( icfs ) . up until recently ,",
    "the available icfs were based on the similarities of ionization potentials of the ions involved or on the results provided by a small number of photoionization models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this problem is now alleviated by the new and more reliable icfs calculated by @xcite , which are based on large grids of models .",
    "these new icfs can be used to derive more reliable estimates of the chemical abundances , including those elements that are expected to be modified during the evolution of the stellar progenitors of pne , namely , helium , nitrogen , and carbon .    a very useful abundance ratio in the study of pne is c / o .",
    "its value is related to the initial mass and metallicity of the progenitor star since these parameters determine the efficiencies of the nucleosynthesis processes that change the relative abundances of c and o. stars are born with c / o  @xmath11 ( c / o  @xmath12 for solar metallicity ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lowest mass agb stars ( with initial masses below @xmath13 m@xmath6 ) , do not go through the tdu or hbb , and thus keep their c / o values below 1 .",
    "they are thus defined as o - rich stars .",
    "intermediate mass stars , with masses between @xmath132.0 m@xmath6  and @xmath145 m@xmath6  ( the mass range depends on metallicity and on the assumptions of the model calculations ) , suffer the tdu that increases the c abundance in the surface transforming the o - rich star into a c - rich star ; these stars have c / o  @xmath15 . in the most massive progenitors , with masses above @xmath16 m@xmath6 , hbb counteracts the effect of the tdu and prevents the formation of a c - rich star ; therefore , for these stars one gets again c / o  @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the value of c / o in the atmospheres of agb stars , which are among the most efficient sources of dust in the galaxy @xcite , defines the type of dust grains that are formed .",
    "when oxygen is more abundant than carbon , oxygen - rich grains , such as silicates and oxides , will be formed .",
    "if carbon is more abundant , other dust species are expected to form , such as sic , tic , and mgs .",
    "if we assume that the c / o abundance ratio ( where c and o are the total abundances of these elements present in dust grains and in the gas ) has not changed from the time when dust formation initiated , the type of grains found in pne will be related to the value of c / o in the atmosphere of the pn progenitor .",
    "therefore , using infrared spectra we can identify different dust grains in pne and thus classify them as c - rich ( c / o  @xmath15 ) or o - rich ( c / o  @xmath11 ) pne .",
    "this inference on whether the ejected atmosphere of the progenitor star has c / o above or below 1 can be better than the one obtained with the c / o abundance ratio derived using emission lines , since the latter can be affected by depletion of c or o into dust grains and by the uncertainties involved in its calculation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our aim here is to study the chemical abundances of a group of pne that have high quality optical and infrared spectra .",
    "the optical spectra are used to derive the element abundances and the infrared spectra are used to identify pne with either oxygen - rich dust ( ord ) or carbon - rich dust ( crd ) .",
    "we explore if the two groups of pne , characterized by different dust grains , show differences in their chemical content .",
    "the abundances of the pne are also compared with the predictions of recent nucleosynthesis models and with the chemical abundances derived for a group of galactic h@xmath0ii regions .",
    "for the purpose of the present study , we need a sample of pne with high quality spectra ( i.e. , with a high signal - to - noise ratio and spectral resolution better than 4  ) , allowing us to perform the usual plasma diagnostics with good precision , to derive accurate abundances of elements that show only weak lines , such as cl , and to determine ( in most cases ) the carbon - to - oxygen abundance ratio from very weak recombination lines .",
    "most of the 57 planetary nebulae compiled by @xcite meet these requirements . from this sample",
    ", @xcite extracted 33 pne with available infrared spectra . in this paper , we have selected the 20 pne that we can classify as oxygen - rich or carbon - rich , i.e. , objects that have in their infrared spectra either ord features ( amorphous or crystalline silicates ) or the broad features around 11 and 30 @xmath17 m associated with sic and mgs , respectively , that are expected to arise in carbon - rich environments @xcite .",
    "many of the objects in the sample also show features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , but since pahs are sometimes detected in pne with silicates , we do not use these features to classify the pne as carbon - rich or oxygen - rich .",
    "our selection criterion excludes ngc  2392 , that contains dust grains ( as can be inferred from the shape of its continuum ) , but shows no clear evidence of any of the previously mentioned dust features .",
    "we also excluded from the analysis pne like ngc  6884 and ngc  6741 that show pah emission , but whose available infrared spectra do not allow us to detect or to rule out the presence of silicates or the 11 and 30 @xmath17 m features .",
    "in summary , we use the above information to classify the sample in two groups : 1 ) ord pne are those with silicates and 2 ) crd pne are those with the broad features associated with sic and mgs .",
    "some of the pne with ord and crd also show emission from pahs .",
    "the so - called dual chemistry pne are those having pah emission and silicate dust features ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the compilation of dust features is taken from @xcite and is based on _ spitzer _ and _ iso _ spectra .",
    "the sample of pne includes objects from the galactic disc , bulge , and halo .",
    "dddm  1 , with a height above the galactic plane of @xmath18 kpc @xcite , is our only object from the halo .",
    "eight pne belong to the bulge : cn  1 - 5 , h  1 - 50 , m  1 - 42 , m  2 - 27 , m  2 - 31 , m  2 - 42 , ngc  6439 , and m  1 - 20 .",
    "these pne satisfy the three criteria used by @xcite to identify bulge pne , namely , they are located within 10@xmath19 in terms of latitude and longitude with respect to the galactic centre , their angular diameters are smaller than 20@xmath20 , and their radio fluxes at 6 cm are lower than 100 mjy .",
    "the remaining 11 pne belong to the disc , and a calculation using the distances provided by @xcite and adopting a solar galactocentric distance of 8.0 kpc indicates that they have galactocentric distances between 6 and 9 kpc , so that they can be loosely described as belonging to the solar neighbourhood",

    "we use the software pyneb @xcite to calculate the physical conditions , the ionic abundances from collisionally excited lines ( cels ) , and the ionic abundances of @xmath21  and @xmath22  from recombination lines ( rls ) .",
    "we have selected for our calculations the atomic data listed in table  [ tab:2 ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we determine two electron temperatures , @xmath23 , for each nebula using the diagnostic ratios [ o@xmath0iii ] @xmath244363/(@xmath244959+@xmath245007 ) and [ n@xmath0ii ] @xmath245755/(@xmath246548+@xmath246583 ) .",

    "we prefer to use the median since , in the low and high density limits , it is less affected than the mean by the large changes in the density caused by small variations in the intensity ratios .",

    "can be overestimated .",
    "@xcite derived an expression to calculate this contribution that depends on the n@xmath25 abundance , and also , to a small degree , on the value of @xmath23 .",
    "the n@xmath25 abundance can be determined using optical rls , ultraviolet cels , or infrared cels , with the choice of lines leading to very different results ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the size of the correction is somewhat uncertain , and we decided not to use it here .",
    "however , we estimate an upper limit to this effect by using the largest possible value for the n@xmath25 abundance , the one implied by rls .",
    "the most affected objects are the pne dddm  1 , ngc 3242 , and ngc  6826 . in the case of dddm  1 ,",
    "where @xcite estimate that recombination is the dominant contribution to the emission of [ n@xmath0ii ] @xmath245755 , we could use @xmath23([o@xmath0iii ] ) to derive all the chemical abundances , but we find very similar results .",
    "for ngc 3242 and ngc  6826 , the corrected values of @xmath23([n@xmath0ii ] ) increase the o / h and cl / o abundance ratios by @xmath260.6 dex . for the other objects , the corrections are much smaller , leading to changes in our abundance ratios lower than 0.1 dex .",

    "many studies still use icfs based on similarities of ionization potentials .",
    "those however ignore the fact that a small difference in the ionization potential may lead to a significant change in the ionization structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the ionization structure is not only governed by the spectral energy distribution of the stellar radiation field but also by the importance of recombination and charge exchange reactions .",
    "photoionization models allow a much better estimate of icfs . for pne ,",
    "the icfs proposed by @xcite have been used for two decades .",
    "however , there is no real documentation on how they were obtained and there is no estimate of their uncertainties .",
    "a set of formulae has been proposed recently by @xcite , based on an extensive grid of _ ab initio _ photoionization models aiming at representing the whole manifold of pne .",
    "the large set of considered photoionization models allowed , for the first time , an estimation of the error bars on icfs .",
    "they are computed using the analytical expressions provided by @xcite , which are based on the maximum dispersion of each icf obtained from the grid of photoionization models .",
    "those icfs were tested by applying them to a large sample of pne and checking that the derived abundance ratios did not depend on the degree of ionization of the objects .",
    "the sample of pne considered here is a specific sample excluding high density objects and objects ionized by very hot stars .",
    "we therefore checked if the icfs from @xcite , which were obtained by considering a wider sample of physical conditions , remain valid for the restricted subsample of photoionization models better representing our observational sample , i.e. , we discard the models with very high gas density or with ionizing stars of very high effective temperatures .",
    "we found that the icfs presented in delgado - inglada ( 2014 ) remain valid for the restricted subsample of models , both as regards the analytical formulae for the icfs and as regards the error estimates .",
    "we thus adopted the icfs derived by @xcite to calculate the abundance ratios ar / o , c / o , cl / o , ne / o , he / h , and o / h .",
    "the icf for o is based on he@xmath25/(he@xmath198+he@xmath25 ) , the icfs for ar , c , cl , and he are based on o@xmath25/(o@xmath198+o@xmath25 ) , and the icf for ne is based on both ratios . as for n ,",
    "we show here the results obtained with the icf derived by @xcite as well as those derived with the widely used icf , n / o = n@xmath198/o@xmath198 ( which are the ones listed in table  [ tab:5 ] ) .",
    "we will discuss the differences between both estimates of n / o in section  4.5 .",
    "for the h@xmath0ii regions we are considering in this paper , the situation is a priori worse .",
    "formulae for icfs based on photoionization models have been proposed by @xcite , but they were proposed and tested for giant extragalactic h@xmath0ii regions , and there is a priori no reason why they should apply to slit observations of nearby dense h@xmath0ii regions , some of them ionized by single stars .",
    "in fact , we find that they introduce a dependence of the total abundances of argon and neon on the degree of ionization for the h@xmath0ii regions in our sample . in absence of any adequate set of icfs , we used for our h@xmath0ii regions the same expressions that we used for our pne . in principle",
    ", we could trim the grid of models built for pne to retain only those that would be adequate for the h@xmath0ii regions we consider ( ie . remove the models with effective temperatures above 50000 k and all those that have a shell structure or are density bounded ) and use the trimmed grid to compute icfs that would be relevant for our sample of h@xmath0ii regions . in practise",
    ", we checked that the formulae given by @xcite actually fit the trimmed grid quite well ( except for the determination of ar / o in objects where o@xmath25/(o@xmath198+o@xmath25 ) is larger than 0.5 , where the resulting bias on ar / o can go up to @xmath2360.09 dex .",
    "one important advantage of the icfs used here to determine the cl and ar abundances is that they can be used when only lines of cl@xmath25 and ar@xmath25 , respectively , are observed .",
    "these ions can be analysed using relatively bright lines in the optical spectrum , which makes it easier to achieve a homogeneous calculation of the total abundances .",
    "other icfs in the literature include more ions that have relatively weak emission lines , such as the [ ar@xmath0iv ] @xmath237 lines in some objects , or that lie in a spectral range that it is not often observed , such as [ cl@xmath0ii ] @xmath238 .",
    "moreover , we found , from the grid of photoionization models computed in @xcite , that the other icfs in the literature for ar and cl introduce a higher dispersion in the derived abundances .",
    "as for the o / h values computed from rls , for the h@xmath0ii regions we adopt those provided by @xcite .",
    "they are based on the o@xmath200 and o@xmath25 abundances derived with o@xmath0i and o@xmath0ii rls for some objects ; for other objects o@xmath0i rls could not be measured properly and the o@xmath200 abundances are based on the abundances implied by cels corrected upwards to account for the possible presence of small temperature fluctuations within the nebulae .",
    "we note that the results of @xcite show that some of the dispersion in these values of o / h ( and in the corresponding values based on cels ) arises from the galactic abundance gradient .",
    "the assumption of small temperature fluctuations might not be right for the pne @xcite .",

    "we use the method described above when using the icf from @xcite , and we adopt a uniform distribution of errors of @xmath355 dex when using n / o = n@xmath198/o@xmath198 , which seems reasonable given the dispersion we get for abundance ratios like n / o and n / cl in the sample h@xmath0ii regions .    as for he , @xcite proposed that one should compute the total he abundance by adding the contributions of he@xmath198 and he@xmath25 , including the contribution of he@xmath356 in the uncertainties associated with he / h . there are four objects in the sample ( three h@xmath0ii regions and one pn ) with a very low degree of ionization , where the abundance of he@xmath356 is important and thus , the value of he / h is very uncertain .",

    "here we use the icfs from @xcite in all the objects , regardless of their degree of ionization , but we assign higher uncertainties in the icfs when the objects fall outside the range of validity . the low dispersion found in some of the abundance ratios , such as ar / cl , suggests that the adopted icfs are still valid outside the ranges proposed in @xcite , at least in some cases .    since the icfs for many elements",

    "the tight correlation between the cl / h and the ar / h values is in agreement with a lockstep evolution of both elements , at least for the metallicity range covered by our objects .",

    "six of the seven h@xmath0ii regions show similar metallicities , indicating that the interstellar medium in the solar neighbourhood is chemically well mixed .",
    "this is confirmed by the values we find for o / h for the seven h@xmath0ii regions ( see table  [ tab:5 ] and figure  [ fig : ocl ] below ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : necl ] shows the results for neon .",
    "neon can be produced in stars with initial masses in the range @xmath3714 m@xmath6  @xcite , and @xcite argue that there is evidence for neon enrichment in some galactic pne .",
    "our ne / cl abundance ratios show a large dispersion , and the fact that crd pne , h@xmath0ii regions , and ord pne cover similar ranges in ne / cl suggests that this dispersion arises from uncertainties in the icf for neon .",
    "our sample pne do not show clear evidence for ne enrichment , although we can not rule it out since it could be masked by the uncertainties in the derived ne / h abundance ratio .",
    "if we reject the high value of ne / cl in ngc  3576 , since it could be due to the too low value found for cl / h in this object , we can see that the other h@xmath0ii regions and several pne cluster around the solar value of ne / cl .",
    "the remaining pne might have some neon enrichment .",
    "our results for the o / cl abundance ratio as a function of o / h and cl / h are presented in figure  [ fig : ocl ] .",
    "note that the trend followed by the dots that show the results of our montecarlo propagation of errors in the right panel of figure  [ fig : ocl ] is caused by the correlation between the uncertainties in the values we derive for o / cl and cl / h .",
    "the trend is not present in our computed values for these abundance ratios .",
    "however , in order to check if the icf used to calculate the o / cl values is introducing a bias in our results , we plot in figure  [ fig : oclgio ] the o / cl abundance ratios as a function of the degree of ionization , given by @xmath372 ) , which is the parameter on which the icf is based : @xmath373 .",

    "the exception is ngc  6826 , the crd pn with the highest metallicity , according to its chlorine abundance .",
    "the straightforward explanation of this result is that the low - metallicity crd pne besides being c - rich are enriched in oxygen .    as we commented in section  1",
    ", canonical agb models like those of @xcite do not predict oxygen enrichment at the metallicities that characterize our sample pne , but models with diffusive convective overshooting like those of @xcite , predict that the ejecta of stars with initial masses of @xmath3713 m@xmath6  and metallicities @xmath375 and 0.02 will be enriched in both c and o ( with c / o  @xmath15 ) , with an increase in the o / h abundance ratio of up to @xmath376 dex .",
    "this agrees with the differences we find in the average values of @xmath357(o / cl ) for our objects : @xmath377 for the crd pne excluding ngc  6826 , @xmath378 for the ord pne , and @xmath379 for the h@xmath0ii regions .",
    "the fact that the crd pn with the highest metallicity , ngc  6826 , has a value of o / cl similar to the ones found for ord pne and h@xmath0ii regions suggests that o enrichment is no longer important at metallicities close to solar , but this should be confirmed by the analysis of other crd pne with similar metallicity .",
    "note that ngc  6826 is suspected to have a binary companion @xcite , which might be responsible for its carbon enrichment .",
    "we performed a rough estimation of the amount of oxygen produced by low - mass stars and high - mass stars using the yields calculated by @xcite . to do this , we integrated the net yields over the @xcite initial mass function in two mass ranges : 1.655 m@xmath6  and 1560 m@xmath6  for @xmath380 , 1.655 m@xmath6   and 1525 m@xmath6  for @xmath375 .",

    "these percentages are small , but they are likely to increase at lower metallicities , and detailed chemical evolution models will be needed to find out if low - mass stars are important producers of oxygen in different galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : ocl ] offers an explanation for the overabundance of oxygen in pne of the solar neighbourhood found by @xcite",

    "@xcite argues that if the bulge pne had progenitor masses above 4 m@xmath6 , we would observe in the bulge bright carbon stars arising from stars of 24 m@xmath6 , which is not the case .",
    "following the suggestion of @xcite that there is a population of helium - enhanced stars in the bulge , similar to those found in some globular clusters , @xcite constructs a set of agb models with masses between 1.2 and 1.8 m@xmath6 , @xmath385 , and pre - enriched in helium , finding that they can reproduce the observed abundance ratios .    since chlorine is a better proxy for the metallicity than oxygen , we display in figure  [ fig : ncl ] the results for the nitrogen abundances relative to chlorine .",
    "we also show the predictions from the nucleosynthesis models of @xcite and @xcite . as expected , the results for the ord pne are almost the same when compared to the values in h@xmath0ii regions because their oxygen abundance has not been modified , but the n / cl values obtained in the crd pne reveal that most of them are also significantly enriched in nitrogen .",
    "figure  [ fig : cohe ] shows the c / o values as a function of he / h , both derived from rls . for three of the ord",
    "we do not have an estimate of the c / o abundance ratio and they do not appear in this figure . in principle ,",
    "rls and cels might be tracing different nebular phases ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the values of c / o derived using rls and cels are similar in most cases @xcite .",
    "we can see that the value derived for c / o does not provide a direct indication of the type of dust grains present in a pn .",
    "this can be attributed to the uncertainties involved in its determination , since the c / o value is based on weak rls and requires an icf . in fact , the dispersion of our monte carlo error simulations shows that h@xmath0ii regions and ord pne have c / o values compatible with the expectation that c / o  @xmath11 in these objects and the values of crd pne are also compatible with c / o  @xmath15 , as expected from their dust features .",
    "the average value of c / o for crd pne is also higher than the one shown by the other objects , which cluster around the solar value .",
    "another effect that could affect the observed value of c / o is depletion of carbon or oxygen into dust grains .",
    "for these reasons , the dust features observed in the infrared spectra are likely to provide more reliable information on whether the value of c / o is below or above 1 in each object .",
    "if we now examine the values of he / h ( including those listed in table  [ tab:5 ] for the three ord pne that have no estimate of c / o ) , we can see that excluding the low - metallicity object from the halo , the ord pne have helium abundances which are systematically higher than those found for crd pne and h@xmath0ii regions .",
    "this is consistent with our conclusions above that they had massive ( or pre - enriched ) stellar progenitors , since agb models predict that helium enrichment takes place for the stars with the highest masses .",
    "this is illustrated in the right panel of the figure , where we plot the same models we used for figure  [ fig : no ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : coo ] , we also show the derived values of c / o but now as a function of the oxygen abundances implied by rls ( listed in table  [ tab:5 ] ) . since the correct values for the nebular oxygen abundances are likely to be intermediate between the ones implied by cels and rls ( or close to either one ) , the o / h values derived from rls complete our picture of the distribution in metallicity of the sample objects and their comparison with the sun .",
    "the o / h values for h@xmath0ii regions and ord pne should be corrected upward by 0.100.15 dex to take into account the presence of oxygen in silicates and oxides within dust grains @xcite . with this correction",
    ", the oxygen abundance in the h@xmath0ii regions would still be below solar for the results based on cels , but would agree both with the solar abundance and with the abundances found for nearby b stars @xcite for the results based on rls . on the other hand ,",
    "the oxygen abundances derived with cels imply that the ord pne of the solar neighbourhood have a chemical composition which is close to solar , whereas rls imply that these objects are significantly more metal - rich than the sun .",
    "both rls and cels imply that several nearby pne are more metal - rich than the h@xmath0ii regions , a result confirmed by the derived values of cl / h .",
    "figure  [ fig : coo ] also shows the predictions of the agb models of @xcite and @xcite . in both sets of models the results for the lower mass objects",
    "indicate the initial values of o / h . as we commented above",
    ", the models of @xcite for the most massive stars with @xmath383 predict significant oxygen destruction , whereas the models of @xcite with initial masses of 23 m@xmath6are enriched both in carbon and oxygen . as discussed above ,",
    "our results for the crd pne agree with the predictions of @xcite , at least for @xmath375 .",
    "an extended analysis of other crd pne might provide more information .",
    "we have studied the chemical composition of 20 galactic pne with high quality infrared and optical spectra .",
    "the sample includes one halo pn , eight bulge pne , and eleven disc pne .",
    "we have also selected from the literature seven h@xmath0ii regions from the solar neighbourhood with the best available optical spectra.using the infrared dust features we have classified the pne in two groups : pne with ord and pne with crd .",
    "the first ones show amorphous and/or crystalline silicates in their spectra whereas the second ones show the broad features at 11 and/or 30 @xmath17 m associated with sic and mgs .",
    "we have computed the physical conditions and the chemical abundances following the same procedure in all the objects .",
    "the abundances derived here are based on the best available icfs , mainly those derived by @xcite , and the uncertainties in the element abundances include the uncertainties introduced by the physical conditions , the ionic abundances , and the icfs .",
    "we find a tight correlation between the abundances of cl and ar , in agreement with a lockstep evolution of both elements .",
    "the metallicity in our sample , traced by cl / h , covers one order of magnitude , and there are significant differences in the cl / h ratio among the three groups of objects studied here . in general , the pne with crd have low metallicity , the h@xmath0ii regions have intermediate metallicities , and the pne with ord cover the whole range of metallicity ( with some of them showing the highest abundances , even higher than the solar ones ) .",
    "this result indicates that the progenitors of the pne with crd were formed in a sub - solar metallicity medium ( with the exception of ngc  6826 , with a value of cl / h similar to the h@xmath0ii regions ) whereas most of the pne with ord were formed in a near - solar metallicity medium ( with the exception of the halo pn dddm  1 ) .",
    "the neon abundances at a given metallicity show a relatively large dispersion",
    ". the dispersion could be due to uncertainties in the icf but we can not rule out that some of the pne are neon enriched .",
    "the oxygen abundances do not always trace the metallicities of the objects .",
    "the o / cl values in the sun , the pne with ord , and the h@xmath0ii regions are similar , but most of the pne with crd show o / cl values that are higher by a factor of two .",
    "the exception is ngc  6826 , the crd pn with higher metallicity in our sample .",
    "as we mentioned above , the progenitors of most of the pne with ord were formed in an environment with near - solar metallicity , where the nucleosynthesis process that can change the initial oxygen abundance are less efficient .",
    "this is in agreement with the similar values of o / cl found in these pne and in the h@xmath0ii regions .",
    "the low cl / h abundances and the high o / cl values found in all but one of the pne with crd provide evidence of oxygen production in the progenitor stars of pne with crd .",
    "non - standard nucleosynthesis models , such as those by @xcite , that include an extra mixing mechanism , predict a significant production of oxygen via the third dredge - up in stars with masses around @xmath3713 m@xmath6 , explaining our results .",
    "the relevance for galactic chemical evolution of oxygen production in low mass stars deserves further study using chemical evolution models .",
    "the comparison of the he / h , c / o , and n / o abundance ratios derived for the pne with the predictions of nucleosynthesis models , suggests that the pne with crd descend from stars with masses in the range 1.53 m@xmath6whereas the pne with ord and the highest abundances of nitrogen and helium would arise from stars with higher initial masses .",
    "the theoretical models indicate that they descend from stars with masses @xmath386 m@xmath6 , but this limit would be smaller with models that include stellar rotation , extra mixing processes or pre - enrichment .",
    "our results indicate that ar and cl are the best metallicity indicators for pne . at any metallicity",
    "their abundances reflect the composition of the interstellar medium where the pn progenitors were formed .",
    "moreover , the icfs adopted here for ar and cl can be used when only cl@xmath25 and ar@xmath25 lines are observed , making easier a homogeneous calculation of pn metallicities .",
    "high resolution and deep spectra are needed , especially of extragalactic pne , to delve in this issue and calculate , for example , metallicity gradients using cl or ar . besides",
    ", the obtention of high quality optical spectra in which we can measure cl and ar lines will provide more reliable estimates of the electron densities .",
    "the observed extragalactic pne are often the brightest ones , with high electron densities , where the commonly used density diagnostic ratio based on [ s@xmath0ii ] lines is not sensitive .",
