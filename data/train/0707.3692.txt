    "a semiconductor superlattice ( sl ) is a periodic heterostructure made of repeated layers of two host materials which are structurally similar but possess different electrical properties @xcite .",
    "the periodicity of the one  dimensional sl potential along the layer growth direction @xmath0 with the period @xmath1 [ composed of the quantum well ( qw ) width @xmath2 and the barrier thickness @xmath3 gives rise to the energy miniband structure within the conduction band of the host material .",
    "the sl thus provides a unique artificial system where the electron transport through the minibands can be controlled by selecting the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath4 and the effective barrier height .",
    "wider qws and/or thicker barriers characterize a weakly coupled sl with small or even negligible overlap of electron wave functions from adjacent wells .",
    "the corresponding electron system tends to be two - dimensional ( 2d ) with an open anisotropic fermi surface ( fs ) of cylindrical shape and sl minibands reduced to discrete energy levels .",
    "the wave function overlap grows upon decreasing the thickness of the layers that form the sl .",
    "it introduces a broadening of sl minibands and the electron system becomes effectively three - dimensional ( 3d ) . in the limiting case of strong",
    "inter - well coupling the fs transforms to a set of closed spheroids .",
    "we use magnetotransport measurements in strong magnetic fields tilted with respect to the qw planes to detect the sl dimensionality by reconstructing the fs in @xmath5-space @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally proved @xcite and theoretically supported ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) that a large in - plane magnetic field component @xmath6 suppresses the inter - well coupling and makes thus a 3d@xmath72d transition possible . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate another experimental possibility how to induce the 3d@xmath72d transition by illuminating a strongly coupled sl .",
    "two different mbe - grown sl structures have been employed in this study .",
    "both comprised 30 periods with @xmath8  nm ( sample _ a _ ) or @xmath9  nm ( sample _ b _ ) , each of them therefore consisted of 29 gaas qws separated by si - doped @xmath10 barriers .",
    "the parameters of the weakly coupled structure _ a _ were @xmath11  nm and @xmath12  nm , those of the strongly coupled structure _ b _ were @xmath13  nm and @xmath14  nm . all the barriers were composed of central si - doped parts of thickness 3.7  nm and 2.7  nm for structures _ a _ and _ b _ , respectively , surrounded by undoped spacer layers 0.65  nm thick .",
    "several samples in the hall bar geometry have been patterned by means of the optical lithography , equipped with evaporated augeni contacts and adjusted to ceramic chip carriers .",
    "the chip carrier has been attached to a rotatable plate in a @xmath15he insert . the plate allowed to rotate samples to any angle between the perpendicular ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and in - plane ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) magnetic field orientations .",
    "both the longitudinal ( @xmath20 ) and hall ( @xmath21 ) resistances were measured at @xmath22 = 0.4 k in magnetic fields up to 28 t ( sample _ a _ ) and @xmath22 = 0.3 k , up to 13 t ( sample _ b _ ) . the standard low - frequency ( @xmath23 = 13 hz ) lock - in technique has been employed for the measurement .",
    "a red led was installed close to the sample _ b _ to facilitate its `` in situ '' illumination in liquid @xmath15he .",
    "short current pulses ( @xmath24  msec ) were successively applied to the led while monitoring the decrease of the zero field resistance of the sample .",
    "a few such pulses were sufficient to reach the saturation of the resistance .",
    "all the curves reported below for the illuminated sample _ b _ refer to this saturated state .",
    "experimental curves for a set of tilt angles @xmath25 collected on the sample _ a _ are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "transversal and longitudinal magnetoresistance curves of the weakly coupled sl _ a _ at various tilt angles @xmath25 .",
    "the insert shows cross - sections of the fs for two limited configurations of the applied magnetic field , normal and parallel to the sample plane . ]",
    "c +    from the occurence of the quantum hall effect we may conclude that the sl _ a _ represents a nearly perfect 2d system with negligible coupling of the 2d electron layers confined in the qws . from the positions of the quantum hall electron plateaux ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are integer numbers and @xmath28 is the amount of qws in the sl ) we estimated that 28 qws are occupied by electrons , which is very close to the nominal value 29 .",
    "the electron concentration per layer @xmath29  @xmath30 extracted from the linear part of the hall magnetoresistance is in a good agreement with the value @xmath31",
    "@xmath30 obtained from the period of sdh oscillations at @xmath32",
    ". corresponding electron mobility per layer is @xmath33  @xmath34/v@xmath35sec .",
    "oscillations of @xmath20 are shifted to higher fields with tilting the angle , satisfying the cosine law .",
    "the fs of the sample _ a _ has a form of a smoothly corrugated ( almost flat ) cylinder ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) that was expected for the slightly coupled sl .",
    "it is difficult to detect the positions of `` belly '' ( at the center of the brillouin zone , @xmath36 ) and `` neck '' ( at the brillouin zone boundry , @xmath37 ) extremal cross - sections of the fs , as their areas are nearly the same .",
    "magnetotransport data measured on the sample _ b _ before and after illumination are presented in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "magnetoresistance curves of the sl `` in dark '' exhibit strong deviations from the 2d behavior seen in the sample _",
    "a_. the hall resistance grows almost linearly with increasing field .",
    "sdh oscillations can be seen for all slopes of the magnetic field even in the strictly in - plane orientation .",
    "these oscillations are found to be periodic in 1/b with a single period .",
    "thus , the fs of the sl _ b _",
    "`` in dark '' is formed by an ellipsoid [ see the inset in fig .  [ fig2 ] _",
    "( a ) _ ] that confirms the 3d nature of the strongly coupled sl sample .",
    "illumination of the sample _ b _ dramatically changed the magnetoresistance curves .",
    "hall plateaux appeared on @xmath21 curves .",
    "oscillations of @xmath20 acquired more complicated forms and exhibit two distinct periods originated from `` belly '' and `` neck '' orbits .",
    "oscillations weaken with increasing @xmath25 and disappear completely at @xmath18 .",
    "it means that the sl dimensionality has been reduced after illumination .",
    "the fs constructed from experimental periods of `` belly '' and `` neck '' sdh oscillations is another evidence .",
    "after illumination the fs of the sl _",
    "b _ has changed its shape to a corrugated cylinder [ see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] _ ( b ) _ ] characteristic for a system composed of weakly - coupled 2d electron layers .",
    "as expected , the carrier concentration per layer was enhanced after illumination from the value @xmath38",
    "@xmath30 to @xmath39  @xmath30 .",
    "the electron mobility per layer increased significantly from @xmath40  @xmath34/v@xmath35sec to @xmath41  @xmath34/v@xmath35sec .",
    "interpretation of the data in terms of the theory @xcite simultaneously leads to a conclusion , that the ground sl miniband shrinks after illumination and therefore the inter - well coupling becomes weaker .",
    "such a surprising behavior may be due to the presence of the metastable ionized deep donors within the barriers , which effectively increases their heights .",
