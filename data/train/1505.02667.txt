    "cold gases of rydberg atoms are currently receiving a growing attention in the communities of quantum optics  @xcite , quantum information  @xcite , and many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "this is rooted in the fact that they offer strong and long - ranged interactions and at the same time grant long coherent lifetimes",
    ". currently , considerable efforts are devoted to developing all - optical quantum information protocols  @xcite with the rydberg - atom - mediated interaction between individual photons  @xcite .",
    "fundamentally important optical devices that operate on the single photon level , such as phase shifters  @xcite , switches  @xcite and transistors  @xcite , have been demonstrated experimentally in rydberg gases .",
    "single photon switchs might form a central building block of an all - optical quantum information processor  @xcite .",
    "the prime function of such switches is to control the transmission of an incoming photon through a single gate photon .",
    "one promising way to realize this is to store the gate photon in form of a gate ( rydberg ) atom immersed in an atomic gas which is in a delocalized spinwave state  @xcite .",
    "the gate atom then prevents transmission of incident photons through the gas , while ideally the coherence of the rydberg spinwave state is preserved  @xcite .",
    "the latter property would permit the subsequent coherent conversion of the rydberg spinwave into a photon which would pave the way for gating the switch with superposition states that can also be subsequently retrieved .",
    "currently , there is only a basic understanding of how the coherence of the rydberg spinwave might be affected by the scattering of incoming photons and no systematic study of this important question exists .    ,",
    "excited state @xmath0 ( decay rate @xmath1 ) and rydberg state @xmath2 are resonantly coupled by a single photon field @xmath3 ( with collective coupling strength @xmath4 ) and a classical field of rabi frequency @xmath5 .",
    "initially a gate photon is stored as a spinwave in the rydberg state @xmath6 ( indicated by the green circle ) .",

    "( b ) for @xmath12 and @xmath13 the polarization profiles associated with the two gate atom positions are distinguishable .",
    "( c ) when @xmath14 the polarization profile is independent of the gate atom position which leads to enhanced coherence of the stored spinwave . ]    in this work we address this outstanding issue within a simple model system .",
    "we study the propagation of a single photon under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in a cold atomic gas in which a gate photon is stored as a rydberg spinwave .",
    "an incident photon subsequently experiences a rydberg mediated van der waals ( vdw ) interaction with this stored gate atom which lifts the eit condition and renders the atomic medium opaque . in this case",
    "the incident photon is scattered incoherently off the rydberg spinwave .",
    "we study the photon propagation and explore the dependence of rydberg spinwave coherence on the interaction strength ( parameterized by the blockade radius @xmath15 ) , the system length @xmath11 and bandwidth of the incident photon pulse .",
    "our findings confirm that strong absorption , i.e. high gain , can be achieved already for large systems ( @xmath12 ) while coherence of the spinwave is preserved only for sufficiently strong interactions , i.e. @xmath14 . intuitively ,",
    "this can be understood by regarding the scattering of the incoming photon as a measurement of the position of the gate atom . when @xmath14 this measurement is not able to resolve the position of the excitation and hence coherence of the rydberg spinwave is maintained .",
    "our study goes beyond this simple consideration by taking into account propagation effects , a realistic interaction potential and a finite photon band width .",
    "the results can therefore be considered as upper bounds for the fidelity with which a rydberg spinwave can be preserved and re - converted into a photon in an experimental realization of a coherent cold atom photon switch .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce a one - dimensional model system to study the propagation dynamics of single source photons in the atomic gas prepared in a rydberg spinwave state . in sec .",
    "iii , the model system is solved numerically with realistic parameters .",
    "we identify the working regime for a single photon switch where the source photon is scattered completely . in sec .",
    "iv , we numerically study the fidelity between the initial spinwave state and the final state after the source photon is scattered .",
    "our calculation shows that the coherence of the spinwave is preserved when @xmath16 while the final state becomes a mixed state when @xmath17 . in sec .",
    "v , we provide analytical results for a coherent single photon switch ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we reveal that the transmission and switch fidelity depend nontrvially on the optical depth and bandwidth of the source photon field .",
    "we summarize in sec . vi .",
    "our model system is a one - dimensional , homogeneous gas consisting of @xmath19 atoms , whose electronic levels are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration]a . the photon field @xmath20 and the eit control laser ( rabi frequency @xmath5 ) resonantly couple the groundstate @xmath21 with the excited state @xmath0 and @xmath0 with the rydberg state @xmath2 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use polarization operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 to describe the slowly varying and continuum coherence of the atomic medium @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",

    "[ fig : illustration]b , c ) .",
    "we assume furthermore that the interaction between atoms in state @xmath2 and the gate atom is infinite for distances smaller than the so - called blockade radius @xmath10 and zero otherwise . outside the blockade region , the photon propagates ( along the @xmath39 direction ) as a dark - state polariton by virtue of eit  @xcite . inside the blockade region",
    "the medium behaves like an ensemble of two - level system . here",
    "the incoming photon is building up a non - zero polarization @xmath37 , whose modulus square is the probability density distribution for finding an atom in the decaying state @xmath0 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] )  @xcite .",
    "eventually , this leads to the loss of the incoming photon and makes the medium opaque .",
    "in order to understand how such photon scattering affects the coherence of the properties of the spinwave one needs to analyze the shape of the polarization profile . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : illustration]b this in general depends on the position of the gate atom when the system length is larger than the blockade radius @xmath40 . here , since @xmath41 and @xmath13",
    ", it is possible to distinguish the profiles @xmath7 which are associated with the two possible positions of the gate atom .",
    "conversely , the polarization @xmath7 becomes independent of the gate atom position when @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration]c ) . in this case",
    " as discussed in detail later  the coherence of the spinwave will be preserved as one can not distinguish gate atoms from the scattered photon .",
    "let us now consider the actual photon propagation together with a realistic interaction potential .",

    "the solution of the master equation ( [ eq : masterequation ] ) is  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the first term on the rhs describes the unhindered photon propagation through the medium , while the second term accounts for the photon scattering , i.e. photon - loss from the medium .",
    "to calculate ( [ eq : densityevolution ] ) we first treat the dynamics under the effective hamiltonian in the heisenberg picture . to this end",
    "we obtain the equation of motion for the expectation values @xmath57 from the corresponding operator heisenberg equation  @xcite .",
    "note , that due to the linearity of the equations we can moreover calculate the expectation value for each component @xmath58 of the rydberg spinwave , i.e. each of the possible positions of the gate atom , separately .",

    ", we find that stronger couplings generally are accompanied by a lower transmission .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the transmission increases with decreasing pulse duration @xmath70 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pulse contains increasingly more weight on frequency components , which are outside the absorption window of the medium . for the purpose of complete photon scattering ,",
    "one thus has to utilize narrow frequency band pulses .     as a function of the pulse duration @xmath70 for @xmath76 ( squares ) and @xmath77 ( circles ) .",

    "these findings indicate that one reaches the strong scattering regime when @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is the working regime for the single photon switch where the medium becomes opaque for the incident photon .",
