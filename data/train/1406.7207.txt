    "presolar grains condensed in the ejecta of late - stage stellar objects such as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and type - ii supernovae ( sne ) prior to the formation of the solar system .",
    "these grains survived travel through the interstellar medium , incorporation into the protosolar nebula , the formation of the solar system , and entrainment in asteroids and comets .",
    "primitive meteorites preserved this stardust , from where the grains may be isolated and studied in the laboratory .",
    "each presolar grain is a stellar fossil of its progenitor star ; microstructural and isotopic study allows for inferences regarding the formation conditions and nucleosynthesis processes in the parent star .",
    "many different species of presolar minerals have been discovered @xcite including : nanodiamond @xcite , sic @xcite , graphite @xcite , silicates @xcite , oxides @xcite , and carbide subgrains @xcite , which form in various types and/or outflow regions of stars .",
    "presolar graphite grains are generally quasi - spherical @xcite ; their internal crystal structures range from highly - ordered concentric shells of graphite @xcite to more disrupted turbostratic graphite @xcite .",
    "presolar graphite spherules isolated from the murchison ( cm2 ) and orgueil ( ci1 ) carbonaceous chondrite meteorites have been divided into two major populations on the basis of density : high density ( hd ) ( @xmath0 2.05@xmath1 ; @xmath2 = 2.092.23 @xmath1  for pure graphite ) and low density ( ld ) ( @xmath2 = 1.602.05 @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "isotopic studies indicate that hd and ld grains generally formed in the outflows of agb stars and sne , respectively @xcite .",
    "a relatively small number of hd graphite grains have been identified as having a sn or a born - again agb star origin @xcite , though these grains will not be discussed further here .",
    "hd graphite spherules typically have an onion - like internal structure consisting of concentric sheets of well - ordered graphite @xcite .",
    "in contrast , ld graphite grains are typically comprised of turbostratic graphite , with shorter , curved , discontinuous sheets , where the average distance between stacked graphene sheets is up to 5% larger than in ideal graphite @xcite .",
    "increased disorder in presolar graphite grains has been found to correlate with increased o content @xcite .",
    "approximately one third of hd graphite grains have been found to contain nanocrystalline cores consisting of randomly oriented graphene sheets 34 nm in size that are surrounded by mantles of graphite @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that these nanocrystalline cores formed when c was highly supersaturated in the stellar outflows where they formed , and the transition to longer - range order ( e.g. , mantling graphite ) occurred when the number density of condensable c atoms diminished @xcite . since nanocrystalline cores are always found within mantles of well - graphitized carbon , and never vice versa or in an alternating pattern , these grains likely reflect monotonically changing physical and/or chemical environments in agb outflows .",
    "prior to the present work , there have been no reported findings of ld sn graphite grains containing nanocrystalline cores .",
    "or1d6 m , described in @xcite , is the sixth sample mount of ld presolar graphite grains from the or1d size / density fraction of the orgueil ci chondrite ( @xmath2 = 1.751.92@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "or1d6 m contains grains with likely sn origins based upon nano - scale secondary ion mass spectrometry ( nanosims ) isotopic measurements .",
    "one grain , or1d6m-6 ( @xmath36.5  in diameter , hereafter g6 ) , was selected for further microanalytical and isotopic study in the nanosims , transmission electron microscope ( tem ) , and scanning transmission x - ray microscope ( stxm ) .",
    "after bulk - grain nanosims analysis @xcite , g6 was electrostatically `` picked '' off the mount with an electro - chemically - sharpened w needle and deposited in a drop of lr white hard resin at the bottom of a polyethylene spi beem 1001 capsule .",
    "the capsule tapers pyramidally into a 1 mm @xmath4 1 mm square face . before picking ,",
    "the face was visually inspected under a microscope to ensure a minimal degree of roughness .",
    "carbon fibers ( 50  @xmath4 10 ) were deposited in the drop of resin and arranged around the grain to aid in locating g6 in the tem and stxm .",
    "the capsule s tapered space was then completely filled with resin and cured for 24 hours in a vacuum oven at 70@xmath5c . following the curing process",
    ", a steel screw was glued onto the base of the resin block with epoxy and the polyethylene capsule was removed .",
    "a glass knife was used to trim the square face of the resin block to a 250  @xmath4 250  square centered on the grain and fibers .",
    "the tip of the resin block was then ultramicrotomed into 70 nm - thick sections .",
    "the majority of microtomed sections were deposited on holey - c - coated cu tem grids for tem and stxm analyses , while the remainder sections were deposited on a si wafer for nanosims isotope imaging @xcite .",
    "the latter were chosen to be from the center region of g6 .",
    "isotopic images of the microtome sections on the si wafer were obtained with the cameca nanosims 50l at the department of terrestrial magnetism , carnegie institution of washington . under primary cs@xmath6 bombardment ,",
    "secondary ions of @xmath7@xmath8 , @xmath9@xmath8 , @xmath10@xmath10@xmath8 , @xmath10@xmath11@xmath8 , @xmath10@xmath12@xmath8 , @xmath10@xmath13@xmath8 , and @xmath14@xmath8 were collected in multicollection mode .",
    "c@xmath15 and cn signals were used to determine the @xmath10/@xmath11 and @xmath12/@xmath13 ratios , respectively .",
    "single ions and molecular ions have different energy distributions , so measuring c@xmath15 allows for better alignment with the cn secondary ions @xcite , which are commonly used for n - isotopic measurements by sims @xcite .",
    "additionally , carbonaceous materials often yield ion signals where c@xmath16/c@xmath8 @xmath17 1 , allowing for higher statistical precision .",
    "isotope images were obtained over 515  raster areas , depending on the cross section size , of 256 pixels @xmath4 256 pixels with a dwell time of 10 ms / px .",
    "typically 1020 image frames were gathered per measurement or until the microtome section was sputtered away .",
    "images were analyzed with the custom limage software ( l. r. nittler , carnegie institution ) .",
    "the carbon fibers and resin were measured as standards .",
    "microtome sections on tem grids were analyzed with a jeol high - resolution jem-2100f tem , and a jeol 2000fx tem equipped with a noran ultra - thin window energy dispersive x - ray spectrometer ( edxs ) .",
    "quantitative edxs analysis was performed on all internal subgrains using the cliff - lorimer method @xcite .",
    "electron diffraction patterns were obtained on film in the jem-2100f and were subsequently digitized .",
    "radial profiles across the digitized diffracted electron intensity images were obtained with a modified version of the open source diffraction ring profiler @xcite .",
    "the code was modified to use a polynomial + lorentzian profile of the form :    @xmath18    to model the background diffracted intensity from the central spot , where @xmath19 are polynomial coefficients , @xmath20 is the area under the lorentzian profile , @xmath21 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , and @xmath22 is the median / center position .",
    "the user selects points on the background profile , after which the background is fitted and subtracted .",
    "the polynomial - lorentzian model provides a near - perfect match to the background diffraction intensity , substantially better than the diffraction ring profiler s built - in pseudo - voigt and power - law profiles .",
    "individual diffraction peaks often are not symmetric , having tails toward higher reciprocal spacing .",
    "this characteristic is due both to instrumental broadening and to the fact that the patterns are obtained from finite , non - ideal crystals .",
    "individual diffraction peaks were therefore fitted to an asymmetric lorentzian profile ( eq .  [ lasym ] ) , utilizing nonlinear least - square minimization available through the python package lmfit @xcite , where the fwhm , @xmath21 , was allowed to vary sigmoidally according to an asymmetry parameter , @xmath23 ( eq . [ wx ] ) :    @xmath24    adapted from @xcite .",
    "note that when @xmath25 0 , the peak s median reciprocal space location is no longer identical with the location of the peak s maximum intensity .",
    "additionally , @xmath26 is the full width at half the intensity at the median reciprocal distance , which is larger than the fwhm . to obtain the fwhm",
    ", one must substitute the location of the peak maximum into eq .",
    "[ wx ] or calculate it numerically from the fit .",
    "when @xmath23 = 0 , @xmath21 becomes a constant and the lorentzian returns to its symmetric form ( eq . [ lsym ] ) .",
    "this form of asymmetric lorentzian is advantageous because it models peak tails very well and @xmath21 is constrained between the values 0 and 2@xmath26 .",
    "where two or more diffraction intensity peaks overlapped , all were fitted simultaneously , however only the largest peak was modeled as an asymmetric lorentzian ; the other peak(s ) were fitted to symmetric lorentzian profiles to reduce the number of fitting parameters .",
    "ceylon graphite was used as a calibration standard to determine instrumental broadening of electron diffraction peaks .",
    "flakes of ceylon graphite were ultrasonically dispersed in distilled water and the suspension was deposited on tem grids .",
    "the invariant in - plane ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) diffracted intensity peaks were fitted to symmetric lorentzian profiles to determine the fwhm and d - spacings . due to the ultrasonic dispersion , most of the deposited ceylon graphite was actually single- or few - layered graphene , i.e. there is little to no planar stacking .",
    "therefore , in electron diffraction patterns the ( 002 ) reflection is nearly nonexistent ; in figure  [ fig : ediff ] this ring profile is labeled as `` graphene '' .",
    "after tem analyses , sections of g6 were analyzed with the synchrotron - based stxm at beamline 5.3.2.2 of the advanced light source , lawrence - berkeley national laboratory @xcite .",
    "monochromatic x - rays are generated by electrons transmitted through a dedicated bending - magnet , followed by a spherical - grating monochromator that allows for selection of photon energy up to 800 ev in steps as small as 0.1 ev .",
    "the beam is focused by fresnel zone plate optics into a 2540 nm spot size at the sample .",
    "a three - dimensional data `` stack '' in x @xmath4 y @xmath4 ev was generated by using an interferometer - controlled piezoelectric stage to raster the sample across the beam , and by stepping the energy up after each frame .",
    "the photon energy was increased in steps of 0.1 ev between 283 ev and 296 ev , across the c k - edge , while 0.5 ev steps were used in the pre- and post - edge regions due to time constraints .",
    "the absorbance , or optical density ( od ) , of the sample was calculated as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 was the measured intensity through the sample and @xmath29 was the baseline intensity measured through a hole in the sample .",
    "each pixel within the stack contains an x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes ) spectrum .    within the c k - edge region",
    "there are three diagnostic absorption features for graphite and aromatic carbon : a peak at 285.2 ev , corresponding to the 1s@xmath302p @xmath31  transition ; a sharp peak at 291.5 ev , corresponding to the @xmath32  exciton ; and a broader @xmath32  peak at 292.5 ev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31  peaks were fitted using the same asymmetric lorentzian profile described above for tem diffraction patterns , which performs well in modeling the tail present above the peak absorption energy .",
    "prior to fitting the @xmath31  peaks , a linear fit to the pre - edge region between 270  282 ev was subtracted from the spectra .",
    "the @xmath31  peaks were fitted without modeling the c k - edge as an arctangent or step function . the aim was to compare the @xmath31  peaks by utilizing as few parameters as possible .",
    "additionally , ionization potentials for the relevant c bonds lie far enough above the aromatic @xmath31  peak @xcite , that they need not be subtracted from the spectrum to quantify the @xmath31  resonance .",
    "peak positions were calibrated using co@xmath15 gas prior to any measurements on g6 .",
    "spectra from organic carbonaceous materials often contain other minor peaks in the region between the aromatic @xmath31  and @xmath32  excitons , including those associated with 1s-@xmath31  transitions in ketones ( 286.5 ev ) , aliphatics ( 287.3  288.1 ev ) , and carboxyl ( 288.4  288.7 ev ) @xcite .",
    "to fully deconvolve the spectra and quantify any minor peaks , a continuum step ionization potential for aromatic carbon was subtracted from the spectra .",
    "the continuum step was modeled as an error function ( erf ) of the form :    @xmath33 \\label{eqn : step } \\eqnum{3}\\ ] ]    @xcite where @xmath34 is the energy , h is the height of the step , @xmath35 is the ionization potential ( 290.3 ev for aromatic carbon @xcite ) , and @xmath36 is the width of the step in ev . at energies higher than the ionization potential , the continuum step decays exponentially @xcite , however this does not affect the deconvolution of minor peaks below the ionization potential .",
    "@xmath36 is intrinsically linked to the instrumental resolution @xcite and has been chosen to be 1 ev in earlier work ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "deconvolutions of the nanocrystalline ( core ) and turbostratic graphite ( mantle ) spectra ( see section [ sec : nanocore ] ) are illustrated in figures [ fig : xanes]b - c , where the spectra have been normalized to the area under the @xmath32  peaks .",
    "the asymmetric lorentzian profiles described above ( dashed red in the online version ) and continuum steps located at 290.3 ev with widths of 1 ev ( dashed black ) are subtracted from the absorbance spectra ( solid green online ) .",
    "continuum step heights of 0.21 and 0.25 for the core and mantle , respectively , were chosen so that the residual spectrum ( solid blue online ) was minimized and non - negative .",
    "graphite is composed of conjugated c , so the @xmath37 molecular orbitals are delocalized above and below the graphene sheets , which results in a splitting of the main @xmath31  peak into a large component at 285.2 ev ( @xmath31@xmath38 ) and a smaller component ( @xmath31@xmath15 ) @xmath34 ev higher in energy @xcite .",
    "the insets of figures [ fig : xanes]b - c show a magnified view of the minor peak region where two gaussian profiles ( dotted green online ) were fitted simultaneously ( dashed red online ) to the residual spectrum . in both insets",
    "the smaller of the two peaks at higher energy is the @xmath31@xmath15 peak .",
    "given the contribution from the tail of the asymmetric lorentzian profile fit to @xmath31@xmath38 , the areas under the minor peaks can be assumed to be lower limits .",
    "the drawback of this method is that the @xmath31  peak and the minor peaks are not fitted simultaneously during the deconvolution , however we do not overestimate the ionization potential s contribution , given the asymmetric model of the @xmath31  peak .",

    "presolar grains from sne , including sic x grains , silicon nitride ( si@xmath46n@xmath47 ) grains , and ld graphite grains , often exhibit nucleosynthetic signatures from multiple zones , which implies that mixing in the ejecta must occur @xcite .",

    "are much closer to the ratios of the he / c zone in models of 1520 m@xmath56  sne @xcite than the ratios in the rest of the grain , which likely resulted from a mixture also including material from the overlying he / n zone .",
    "spatially - correlated hotspots of excesses in @xmath13 and @xmath9 have in some cases been found to be carried by internal tic subgrains @xcite , which are indicative of material from the inner portion of the he / c zone @xcite .",
    "in addition to excesses in @xmath13 and @xmath9 , excesses in @xmath10 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are also signatures of the he / c zone in models of 1520 m@xmath56  sne , though once more g6 s measured isotopic compositions are less anomalous than those predicted for pure he / c zone material ( table [ table : g6 ] and figure [ fig : cati ] ) .",

    "three different microtome sections ( g6a , 4.7 ; g6c , 5.7 ; g6i , 5.9 ) on the si wafer were isotopically imaged in the nanosims . as seen in the prior bulk grain measurement , g6i",
    "is highly enriched in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , however this section is only slightly enriched in @xmath13 .",
    "the average isotopic compositions of g6a and g6c are slightly less anomalous than those of g6i .",
    "all sections are more anomalous in their average c isotopic compositions than the bulk grain , however the reverse is true for their n and o isotopic compositions .",
    "g6a , g6c , and g6i also contain large heterogeneities in their c , n , and o isotopic compositions , including regions whose c and n compositions are much more anomalous than in the bulk - grain measurements .",
    "these heterogeneities include both radial gradients in the sections c and o isotopic compositions ( figures [ fig : isoimgs]d - e , [ fig : isoprofs]a - b ) , similar to those observed previously in other sn graphite grains @xcite , as well as small spatially - correlated hotspots of excesses in @xmath13 and @xmath9 likely corresponding to tic subgrains ( figures [ fig : isoimgs]b , c , f ) .",
    "g6a exhibits a smooth radial gradient in @xmath62 and a more irregular gradient in @xmath48 , with @xmath62 ranging from 162 to 147 and @xmath48 from 3000 to 510 ( @xmath53 from 125 to 330 ) moving from the section s center to its edge ( figure [ fig : isoprofs]b ) .",

    "@xcite showed that the surface of g6 was isotopically heterogeneous , with hotspots in @xmath13 and @xmath9 .",
    "these hotspots bias the original bulk grain measurement towards the composition of the presumed tic subgrains and away from the composition of the less - anomalous graphitic material .",
    "hence , the whole - grain n and o measurements closely match the isotopic composition of the tic subgrains identified in the microtome sections .",
    "the most striking feature of the microtome section isotopic images is the complex o - isotopic heterogeneities in g6c and g6i , notably an @xmath9-rich ring of material 2.7  @xmath4 3.3  in size ( figures [ fig : isoimgs]b , c , [ fig : isoprofs]a ) .",

    "since g6a is a smaller section than g6c and g6i , and therefore further from the center of the grain , it is likely that the gradient observed in @xmath53 in this section is simply a cross - section of the o - anomalous shell .",
    "the ring features in g6c and g6i cover 2.6 and 2.3 @xmath64 out of 25.7 and 27.0 @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the center of microtome section g6c , 1  @xmath4 1.5  in size , is also more @xmath9-enriched than the outer region of the grain ( figure [ fig : isoimgs]c ) with @xmath48 = 1585 @xmath63 17  ( @xmath53 = 193 @xmath63 1 ) .",
    "the dimensions of grain section g6c and of its o - anomalous center are similar to those of the tem sections which contain a cross section of the nanocrystalline core , though it can not be unambiguously determined whether the core is present in this particular section .",
    "the center of g6i contains a hole near the identified tic subgrain due to microtome damage , so the o isotopic composition of this region is unknown . it is unknown why the surface hotspots of excesses in @xmath13 and @xmath9 are so much more extreme than those found in g6 s interior .",
    "in addition , it is interesting that the most @xmath9-anomalous regions within g6 s interior are not carried by tic subgrains , but are intrinsic features of the graphite structure .",
    "radial gradients in isotopic composition have been attributed to secondary processes , such as isotopic equilibration with the grain s environment during its lifetime ( e.g. in the protosolar nebula or in the meteorite parent body ) @xcite , and to primary processes , such as the changing isotopic composition of the stellar ejecta during grain formation @xcite .",
    "changes in the grain s local formation environment could be due either to mixing in the stellar ejecta , and/or to the grain s trajectory through regions with varying isotopic composition @xcite . while isotopic equilibration of minor elements is a significant issue in hd presolar graphite grains @xcite",
    ", ld grains typically retain large anomalies in n and o @xcite .",
    "the observations of radial gradients in the c isotopic compositions of ld graphite grains suggest that isotopic equilibration is less prevalent than the minor isotope dilution observed in hd graphite grains @xcite .",
    "the turbostratic structure of ld graphite grains would presumably have to be disrupted in order to exchange a significant portion of the c with the surrounding environment .",
    "additionally , the complex structure of the o anomalies in g6 suggests that isotopic equilibration is not the root cause , as isotopic diffusion should produce a smooth radial gradient .",
    "if a changing local isotopic environment is the cause for the @xmath9-enriched ring , this would require that the isotopic composition changed non - monotonically .",
    "recent three - dimensional simulations of type - ii sn explosions , based upon observations of sn 1987a , provide evidence of the large - scale mixing ( fractions of au ) that occurs between inner and outer pre - sn zone material in the ejecta immediately following the explosion @xcite .",
    "in these models , material from inner zones is ejected asymmetrically through the outer zones , carrying with it a mix of heavy elements in addition to 5070% h and he .",
    "there are considerable spatial variations in composition within individual ejecta .",
    "ni - fe - si and o - ne - mg `` bullets '' of material are separately ejected through the c- , he- , and h - rich outer zones , with the heavier knots of fe - group materials , ne , and mg overtaking the o - rich knots , in effect partially inverting the pre - sn concentric shell structure .",
    "while such simulations can not yet provide the resolution required to argue for grain - size - scale mixing , they do provide evidence that stellar ejecta varies spatially in isotopic / chemical composition .",
    "the cassiopeia a sn remnant has also been identified as having resulted from an intrinsically asymmetric explosion , which caused the composition of ejecta to vary spatially @xcite .",
    "it has been shown for agb stars that grains are coupled to the radiation field of the star , which accelerates them through the gas via radiation pressure @xcite . in effect , the grains act as miniature sails , being propelled faster than the surrounding gas , causing collisions with the gas in front of them .",
    "this could also be achieved from the reverse shock wave from a sn .",
    "with further simulations and observations of sne , there exists the possibility for calculating grain condensation parameters - formation times , radii , velocities relative to gas - as done for agb stars .",
    "more simply , these models provide evidence for the mixing of material between adjacent and non - adjacent sn zones .",
    "we do , however , remain far from the goal of connecting the isotopic signatures of pre - sn zones with the composition of presolar grains via high - spatial - resolution mixing models .",
    "isotope ratio images of microtome sections of g6 reveal numerous isotopic heterogeneities .",
    "these heterogeneities include spatially - correlated hotspots of excesses in @xmath9 and @xmath13 , which are likely carried by internal tic subgrains @xcite .",
    "this isotopic signature is indicative of material from the inner he / c zone in type - ii sn @xcite , while the bulk grain isotopic composition is more similar to a mixture of material from the he / c and he / n zones @xcite .",
    "the presence of radial gradients in @xmath62 , and @xmath9-anomalous shell - like structures provide evidence for mixing in the sn ejecta .",

    "three sections were found to contain a 1.5 to 2  diameter core of nanocrystalline carbon surrounded by a mantle of turbostratic graphite .",
    "all other sections are comprised solely of turbostratic graphite .",
    "nanocrystalline cores have only been reported previously from hd onion - type graphite grains from agb stars @xcite.the nanocrystalline and turbostratic regions of g6 are visually distinct in the tem ( e.g. , figs . [",
    "fig : ediff]a ; [ fig : df]a , c , d ; [ fig : graphitesub]a  d ) . selected area",
    "electron diffraction ( saed ) patterns from the turbostratic graphite mantle ( figure [ fig : ediff]b ) closely match pure graphite .",
    "the dominant feature in the patterns is the ( 002 ) reflection ( d@xmath65 = 3.354  ) , which corresponds to planar stacking of graphene sheets . the measured ( 002 ) d - spacing for turbostratic graphite is 4.9% larger than that of an ideal crystal ( d@xmath66 = 3.52  ) , similar to previous observations of presolar graphite @xcite .",
    "this is corroborated by the measured d - spacing of the ( 004 ) reflection ( d@xmath67 = 1.677  ; d@xmath68 = 1.75  ) , which is 4.5% larger than ideal .",
    "the increase in bond length is partially due to the presence of o trapped between sheets , whose concentration has been shown to correlate with the degree of stacking disorder @xcite .",
    "turbostratic graphite in ld orgueil grains contains a higher concentration of o than their onion - like hd cousins , based upon edxs measurements @xcite . due to the difficulty of quantifying low - z elements ,",
    "however , edxs analysis can only elucidate relative differences in o abundances , not absolute concentrations .",
    "graphane , a hydrogenated form of graphene , is another possible cause of the larger interplanar spacings observed in g6 @xcite . in graphane ,",
    "sheets of c atoms are buckled as h bonds to the sheet surfaces , which pulls c atoms out of the plane .",
    "however , graphane also exhibits a 5% reduction in the hexagonal edge length relative to pure graphene because of sheet buckling .",
    "the other significant features in the saed patterns are diffracted intensity peaks from the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) reflections ( d@xmath69 = 2.131  , d@xmath70 = 1.231  ) , which correspond to the hexagonal planar structure of graphene sheets .",
    "the measured d - spacings for these reflections are within 1% of ideal graphene for both turbostratic and nanocrystalline regions .",
    "as we do not observe any edge - length contraction in the turbostratic or nanocrystalline planar structure , we therefore conclude that o , and not h , is most likely responsible for increased interplanar spacings .",
    "the orientation of a crystal structure relative to the electron beam direction will determine whether the bragg reflection conditions are satisfied , i.e. if the beam is parallel to the given crystal direction .",
    "when many crystals are randomly oriented about the beam axis , such as in powder diffraction , diffraction spots are distributed into rings .",
    "in microtomed sections of presolar graphite grains , graphite layers are oriented perpendicular to the section plane , so a saed pattern will exhibit ( 002 ) rings with most of the diffracted intensity oriented in the direction where crystal layers are parallel to the beam ( figure [ fig : ediff ] ) . since the ( 002 )",
    "crystal direction is orthogonal to both ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) , the direction along which the maximum diffracted intensity lies from these reflections is perpendicular to the maxima in the ( 002 ) ring .",
    "there is a clear planar stacking direction in the turbostratic graphite , visible upon inspection and inferred from the diffraction patterns .",
    "in contrast , the diffracted intensity in the core saed patterns is isotropic for all reflections ( see figures [ fig : ediff]c and [ fig : df]c , d ) , implying that the core consists of small randomly oriented graphene sheets .",
    "unlike hd onion - type graphite grains with sharp boundaries between graphitic and nanocrystalline regimes , the transition in g6 occurs over a distance of 0.25  0.5 .",
    "saed patterns obtained across this transition confirm a weakening ( 002 ) peak with decreasing radius .",
    "the ( 002 ) diffraction peak never disappears in the core , however , in contrast to what was observed in the cores of onion - type graphite grains @xcite , though it is less intense than the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) reflections ( figure [ fig : ediff]d ) .",
    "this implies that coherent planar stacking is present among some graphene sheets within the core .",
    "the measured ( 002 ) d - spacing is 4.9% larger than ideal , similar to that of turbostratic graphite .",
    "all three microtome sections containing nanocrystalline material show the same ( 002 ) reflection feature , so it is unlikely to be due to a contribution from layers of turbostratic graphite included in the nanocrystalline region . using the scherrer formula d = 1.84@xmath71/2@xmath72 , where d is the mass - weighted mean particle diameter , @xmath71 is the wavelength of the electrons ( 0.0025 nm at 200 kev ) , and 2@xmath72 is the angular fwhm of the diffraction peak , we estimate the lateral size of the nanocrystals to be 24 nm , similar to those obtained by @xcite , while the particle size predicted in the planar stacking direction ( 002 ) is @xmath34.5 nm . dark field ( df ) images generated by using the diffracted intensity from the ( 002 ) reflection from the turbostratic graphite ( figures [ fig : df]c - d ) confirm that there are no large - scale graphitic features within the core which might have contributed to the presence of the small observed ( 002 ) reflection .",
    "there are , however , small intense spots in the df images of the core , which may correspond to nanocrystals with planar stacking a few 10s of nm in size",
    ". these randomly - oriented `` larger '' nanocrystals may be responsible for the presence of the isotropic ( 002 ) reflection in saed patterns of the core .      in g6 ,",
    "numerous tic subgrains ( 125265 nm , 2550 ppm ) were observed , as well as fe and fe - ni subgrains ( 1575 nm , 75 ppm ) , and one sic subgrain ( 70 nm , 30 ppm ) .",
    "the tic subgrains have v / ti ratios between 0.098 and 0.104 , in general agreement with previous observations of tic subgrains in sn graphite grains @xcite .",
    "tic and vc are isostructural , allowing for v to exist in solid solution within the tic structure .",
    "si was the only other trace element observed in the tic subgrains , with concentrations varying between 0.5 and 6.9 at.% .",
    "the fe - ni subgrains have varying ni / fe ratios , between 0.023 and 0.253 .",
    "the largest fe - ni grain ( 75 nm ) is an intergrowth of two grains , the larger ( 65 nm ) grain with a ni / fe ratio of 0.038 , and the smaller ( 10 nm ) grain with a ni / fe ratio of 0.253 .",
    "the larger fe - ni grain also contains 1.3 @xmath63 0.2 at.% s , while the smaller grain does not contain any detectable s. the other fe - ni grains contain no detectable s , but do contain varying amounts of si .",
    "one 28 nm grain with strong o and si signals has a ni / fe ratio of 0.054 and a ( fe + ni)/si ratio of 1.9 , resembling fayalitic olivine containing ni in solid solution with fe , although we can not determine the stoichiometry without a quantified o concentration .",
    "this grain was too small to index with electron diffraction .",
    "notably , no subgrains were found within the nanocrystalline core ; the tic subgrain shown in figure [ fig : ediff]a lies at the core s edge .",
    "we also observed two graphite spherule subgrains in g6 .",
    "the larger one is nearly 1  in diameter , with its own distinct nucleation center apparent via visual inspection and in df images generated from ( 002 ) diffracted electron intensity ( figure [ fig : graphitesub ] ) .",
    "this graphite subgrain became stuck to the larger grain when g6 was only two  in size and was mostly nanocrystalline .",
    "turbostratic graphite layers continued to grow radially from the two different centers before the layers eventually unified around a common center . despite the great abundance of metal and carbide subgrains within presolar graphite spherules , agglomerations of individual graphite grains",
    "remain quite rare , perhaps due to a low sticking probability between two comparably sized spherules .",
    "the second , smaller ( 300 nm ) graphite subgrain is present at the surface of g6 and was clearly captured by the larger grain .",
    "this particular subgrain stands out in df images formed with diffracted electron intensity from the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) reflections ( figure [ fig : inclusions ] ) .",
    "the graphite layers of this subgrain are clearly misaligned with the concentric shells of turbostratic graphite which comprise this section of g6 .",
    "additionally , this graphite subgrain contains its own 40 nm @xmath4 20 nm tic subgrain at its center ( figure [ fig : inclusions]d ) .",
    "g6 contains a unique microstructure relative to other presolar graphite grains .",
    "to date it remains the only ld sn graphite grain to contain a nanocrystalline core surrounded by a mantle of turbostratic graphite .",
    "g6 s core is also unique vis -  - vis cores found in hd graphite grains , as it contains evidence for planar stacking of small , otherwise randomly - oriented 2 - 4 nm sheets of graphene .",
    "the microstructural heterogeneities within g6 provide further evidence for a complex and changing formation environment .",
    "the lack of subgrains within g6 s nanocrystalline core is potentially significant for our understanding of the grain s formation sequence , though it is not statistically rigorous .",
    "metal and carbide subgrains have been found within nanocrystalline cores of hd graphite grains ( k. croat , personal communication , december 2013 ) .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite and laboratory observations @xcite have shown that refractory carbide grains , particularly tic , can act as the nucleation point for graphite growth , which unambiguously imply that the tic formed before graphite .",
    "the majority of tic subgrains , however , have been found as inclusions , entrained as the graphite grain grew .",
    "the condensation temperatures , and therefore condensation sequence , for carbonaceous materials including graphite and metal carbides are highly sensitive to the ambient pressures and c / o ratios in stellar ejecta @xcite ( figure [ fig : condensation ] ) .",
    "as the formation of a nanocrystalline conglomerate in lieu of the formation of graphite purportedly requires a high supersaturation of c @xcite , the c partial pressure would also be high , yielding a large local c / o ratio .",
    "since the system was out of equilibrium , this does not necessarily translate to a higher formation temperature . instead",
    ", nanocrystalline conglomerates likely formed very quickly once nucleation points became available . as the saturation of c decreased , the system fell into thermodynamic equilibrium where the carbides were able to form , followed by the turbostratic graphite .",
    "recent laboratory investigations into the formation of carbon `` soot balls '' using pah seeds @xcite may be applicable to the formation of nanocrystalline conglomerates . using various carbonaceous seed molecules and extremely rapid cooling ( temperature gradient of 3000k to 100k over a distance of 1.52.5 mm ) , @xcite `` freeze '' the plasma of seed molecules into conglomerates , whose end products can range up to microns in size .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this particular setup may not be ideal for the formation of carbonaceous particles with long - range crystalline order ( 100 s of nm to 1 ) , which under stellar conditions can take months @xcite or years @xcite to form .",
    "graphitization of carbonaceous materials has been found to decrease progressively with increasing oxidation @xcite .",
    "therefore , turbostratic graphite in ld grains likely required a higher relative o content in the parent gas than graphite found in hd grains , and so the c / o ratio ought to be closer to one in the sn ejecta where g6 formed compared to the agb star ejecta that produced the hd grains .",
    "this is corroborated by recent studies of refractory metal nuggets ( rmns ) found within hd graphite grains @xcite , which show that hd graphite grains form at higher temperatures than ld grains , which therefore requires a larger c / o ratio ( see figure [ fig : condensation ] ) .",
    "this also implies a large temporal change in the ambient c / o ratio within the sn ejecta , from c supersaturation while the nanocrystalline core forms to c / o @xmath3 1 when the turbostratic graphite mantle forms .",
    "hd grains , with near - ideal onion - like graphite condensing over their nanocrystalline cores , would require higher c / o ratios in order to avoid the crystallographic disruption of entrained o. alternatively , co dissociation via uv radiation @xcite might potentially increase the amount of free o available even at larger bulk c / o ratios , which might contribute to the formation of turbostratic graphite in sn ejecta .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that uv dissociation of co molecules would simultaneously not also disrupt c - c bonds .",
    "additionally , the presence of a sic subgrain near the surface of g6 implies that c / o @xmath3 1 by the end of condensation .",
    "figure [ fig : condensation ] also shows pressure and temperature ( p - t ) profiles @xcite derived from observations of clumpy ejecta from sn1987a from 60 to 777 days post - explosion @xcite .",
    "the profiles were derived assuming equilibrium thermodynamics and an average atomic mass of 16 in the ejecta @xcite .",
    "the ejecta s p - t profile evolves from p @xmath3 10@xmath73 bar and t = 2000 k at day 60 to p = 8@xmath410@xmath74 bar and t = 500 k at day 777 ( not shown in figure [ fig : condensation ] ) . also plotted",
    "are p - t profiles for the ejecta with the pressure reduced by factors of 10 , 100 , and 1000 . for clumpy",
    "sn ejecta similar to those of sn1987a , tic would begin condensing at @xmath31715 k and would only do so prior to graphite if the c / o ratio were less than @xmath31.15 . for lower - density ejecta , this formation sequence would be even more constrained .",
    "based upon these observations and derived p - t profiles , it appears that presolar graphite grains from agb stars and sne may form under a similar set of physical conditions .",
    "these profiles do not take into account the specific mixture of gas and its effect upon the condensation temperature .",
    "based upon equilibrium condensation and observations of sn 1987a , sn graphite grains are constrained to form in the first few months to one year post explosion .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath75 excesses as originating from the decay of short - lived @xmath76 ( @xmath77 = 330 days ) in some sic x grains @xcite is in general agreement with this picture .",
    "therefore the ejecta s chemical and isotopic changes as recorded in g6 must also have occurred on this timescale .",
    "xanes spectra from both the turbostratic graphite and nanocrystalline core regions of g6 exhibit graphite - like features ( figure [ fig : xanes ] ) .",
    "the most dominant features include the @xmath31  absorption , located at 285.3 ev and 285.4 ev for the mantle and core , respectively ; and the @xmath32  absorption peaks located at 291.5 ev and 292.5 ev for both materials .",
    "the asymmetry parameters of the @xmath31  peak shapes between the mantle and the core are the same .",
    "the core fwhm is 1.7 ev and the mantle fwhm is 1.9 ev , while the median energies of the peaks are 285.7 ev and 285.8 ev , respectively .",
    "it has been shown for polyaromatic hydrocarbons that as the domain size grows , i.e. as rings are added , discrete @xmath31  resonances around 285 ev begin to overlap and combine to form a single peak such as that observed in graphite @xcite . additionally , decreasing domain size and amorphization of c smooth out the @xmath32  peaks and reduce the intensity of the @xmath31  absorption @xcite .",
    "the domain sizes of the core s nanocrystalline material , determined by electron diffraction , are large enough to retain strong @xmath31  and @xmath32  absorbances .",
    "the primary difference between spectra of the mantle and core is that the mantle spectrum contains a carboxyl peak ( 288.6 ev ) ( figure [ fig : xanes]a ) .",
    "this may be attributed to a higher concentration of o in the region where turbostratic graphite formed . from this",
    "we can also infer that some portion of the o in the turbostratic region is strongly bonded to the disrupted graphite . from comparison of the carboxyl feature in the turbostratic graphite , which is apparent in all cross sections , to o isotope images detailed above",
    ", we can be confident that this peak is not due to a contaminant , as the turbostratic graphite contains the most o - anomalous regions within g6 .",
    "the peaks at @xmath3288.6 ev from the deconvolved turbostratic and nanocrystalline spectra differ in magnitude by a factor of two , while the @xmath31@xmath15 peaks have the same height ( figures [ fig : xanes]b - c insets ) .",
    "correlated nanosims , tem , and xanes studies of the orgueil ld graphite grain g6 have revealed a wonderfully rich and unique sn graphite grain with a complex formation history .",
    "isotopic and structural heterogeneities throughout the grain imply that g6 s progenitor ejecta evolved chemically and isotopically over the timescale of months as the grain condensed .",
    "the magnitude and structure of isotopic and compositional heterogeneities leave little doubt that they are the product of primary formation and are not caused by secondary alteration or isotopic equilibration . to account for the observed o - anomalous shell",
    ", the o isotopic composition of g6 s local environment would have had to change by a factor of 34 non - monotonically during its formation .",
    "these observations may provide evidence for fine - scale mixing in sn ejecta or a mechanism for grain transport through more coarsely mixed ejecta .",
