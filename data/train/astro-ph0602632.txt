    "in a series of papers , de boer et al .  @xcite have put forward the idea that the well - known egret excess of diffuse galactic gamma rays @xcite could be well explained by dark matter annihilations .",
    "the idea that excess from the region near the galactic center may be due to dark matter annihilations has a long history ( at least @xcite ) but de boer et al .",
    "have extended this idea to claim that all the diffuse galactic gamma rays detected above 1 gev by the egret satellite , irrespective of the direction , has a sizeable dark matter contribution ( for a similar , but less explicit , proposal , see @xcite ) .",
    "de boer et al .",
    "propose specific supersymmetric models as examples of viable models with correct relic density , and the gamma - ray fluxes are made to fit the observations .",
    "the price they have to pay , however , is a rather peculiar dark matter halo of the milky way , containing massive , disc concentrated rings of dark matter besides the customary smooth halo .",
    "in addition , they have to crank up the predicted gamma - ray flux by considerable  boost factors \" .",
    "we will here examine these hypotheses a bit closer .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the astrophysical properties and possible inconsistencies of the model .",
    "we point out that , besides the strange features of the halo model ( that we judge difficult to achieve with non - dissipative dark matter ) , supersymmetric models with large gamma - ray flux are essentially always accompanied by a large antiproton flux ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we investigate what the antiproton fluxes would be in the same halo model , using model - by - model the same boost factors as needed to fit the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "we find that low - mass models ( masses less than 100 gev ) that have low boost factors tend to overproduce antiprotons by a factor of around ten .",
    "higher - mass models ( above a few hundred gev ) have a lower antiproton rate , so the overproduction is slightly less .",
    "however , they give hardly any improvements to the fits to the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "we will perform this analysis in a general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , but as the correlation between gamma rays and antiprotons is a general feature , our results will be more general .",
    "our conclusion is that the proposal of de boer et al .",
    "@xcite to explain the gamma excess in all sky directions is , at present , not viable . although  of course ",
    "we can not exclude a small contribution to the diffuse gamma - ray flux from dark matter annihilations .",
    "gamma rays have the advantage of pointing back directly to their sources in the galaxy and not to suffer from energy losses .",
    "this , together with known gamma - ray spectral shape from dark matter annihilation ( distinct from the conventional background ) , permit to extract the sky - projected dark matter distribution from the egret observations . taking this one step",
    "further de boer et al .",
    "propose a specific dark matter profile , with 18 free parameters , and do a best fit to the egret data ( for details , see @xcite ) . the density profile de boer et al .",
    "obtain consists of a dark matter halo with the following ingredients :    * a triaxial smooth halo , * an inner ring at about 4.15 kpc with a density falling off as @xmath0 , and * an outer ring at about 12.9 kpc with a density falling off as @xmath1 .    where @xmath2 is the height above the galactic plane .",
    "the triaxial halo is a modified isothermal sphere , but flattened in the direction of the earth and in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the inner ring is rather broad , but very closely located to the baryonic disc , with an exponential fall - off above the galactic plane .",
    "the outer ring is more massive and slightly narrower and also exhibits an exponential fall - off above the galactic plane .",
    "the outer ring is also taken to have a sharper fall - off on the inside than the outside .",
    "both rings are elliptic .",
    "the details of the parameterization of the dark matter model can be found in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deboer - density ] , we show the strong concentration of dark matter to the disc ( upper panel ) as well as the ring structure of the model ( lower panel ) . the steep exponential density fall - off away from the disc , originating from the two rings , can most clearly be seen in the upper - right plot .    since conventional models of the diffuse gamma - ray emission employ scattering of cosmic rays on gas and dust in the galactic disc",
    ", we may already note that this model will produce a gamma - ray flux that has an angular distribution very similar to the generally accepted cosmic ray contribution @xcite . in fact , besides the need for measurements with a better energy resolution such as will be given by glast , the desired spectral shape can also be obtained by adjusting the balance between the contributions from proton and electron cosmic rays ( whose intensity is very poorly constrained away from the solar neighborhood ) @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that one can get a good agreement with egret data by adjusting the electron and proton injection spectra ( without any need for a dark matter contribution ) .",
    "even though the dark matter halo profile by de boer et al",
    ".  explains the egret data very well , we will here go through some of the astrophysical objections to this model .",
    "first , one may notice that the model of the dark matter really is very close to the `` standard '' model for the baryons of the milky way , containing a thin and a thick disc and a central bulge ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the dark halo is much more massive than the baryonic one , one of the first things one should investigate is whether there is room to place as much unseen matter in the vicinity of the disc as de boer et al .",
    "do .      by observations of the dynamics and density fall - off of stars in the disc , one can get a measure of the gravitational pull perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "this in turn can be converted to an allowed disc surface mass density , a method pioneered by bahcall @xcite .",
    "recent analyses @xcite of the disc surface mass density at the solar system location have converged to a model with little room for a concentration of dark matter in the disc .",
    "observations are well described by a smooth dark matter halo and a disc of identified matter ( mainly containing stars , white and brown dwarfs and interstellar matter in form of cold and hot gases ) .    .measured local surface densities @xmath3 , within heights @xmath4 ,",
    "compared to the amount of dark matter in the model of de boer et al .",
    "the amount of dark matter exceeds the allowed span for unidentified gravitational matter in the inner part of the galactic disc ( i.e.  around @xmath5 ) . @xcite",
    "[ tab : density ] [ cols=\"^,>,<,^,>,<,^,^ \" , ]     let us now focus on the de boer et al .  profile .",
    "the most important parts for the antiproton signal are the rings that decay exponentially with the height above the galactic plane .",
    "hence , this source distribution is much more concentrated to the galactic disc than a smooth halo profile is .",
    "we therefore expect a more modest change of the fluxes with the extreme values of the diffusion parameters than found in @xcite . as a complement to our calculations with darksusy",
    ", we have derived the antiproton fluxes in the de boer model for the extreme diffusion parameters given in @xcite and which we recall in table  [ tab : propagation ] .",
    "this calculation has been done with the propagation code in @xcite .    for illustration",
    ", we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : pbar_prim_vs_sec ] the full yield of primary antiprotons for a selected supersymmetric configuration for which the agreement with the egret data is very good  @xmath6 of order 3 ( neutralino mass of 50.1 gev and derived boost factor of 69 ) . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we have taken into account tertiary antiprotons as in  @xcite and computed the effect of diffusive reacceleration with the help of the same crank - nicholson scheme as in  @xcite .",
    "solar modulation has been modeled with the simple force ",
    "field approximation where a fisk parameter of @xmath7 mv has been assumed .",
    "the red solid curve in fig .  [ fig : pbar_prim_vs_sec ] corresponds to the median cosmic ray configuration of table  [ tab : propagation ] .",
    "the yellow band is delimited by the extreme configurations and gives an indication on how well the flux of neutralino induced antiprotons can be derived in the case of the de boer et al .  dark matter distribution . for the maximal cosmic ray model",
    ", we observe an increase in the antiproton flux by a factor of 2.5 whereas for the minimal configuration , we find a decrease of a factor of 2.6  both at energies lying between 0.4 and 0.6 gev .",
    "the total width corresponds therefore to an overall factor of @xmath8 to be compared to a factor of @xmath9 in the case of an nfw dark matter halo .",
    "as expected , the uncertainties are much smaller in the de boer et al model compared to more conventional halo profile .",
    "again , the main reason for this is that the dark matter in the de boer model is located much closer to the galactic plane and its distribution is reminiscent of the gaseous disc of the milky way that is responsible for the conventional secondary background .",
    "the latter is featured in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbar_prim_vs_sec ] as the narrow green band that has been derived in  @xcite from the observed b / c ratio . from this calculation",
    "we also get an estimate of the possible uncertainties arising from different propagation codes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbar_prim_vs_sec ] , the long  dashed black curve has been computed with the darksusy package using a typical cosmic ray propagation ( as described in @xcite ) . because diffusive reacceleration has not been implemented in that case , the flux falls more steeply close the neutralino mass .",
    "notice however that it is fairly similar to the red solid line , calculate with the propagation code in @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that diffusive reacceleration does not substantially modify the shape of the antiproton spectrum  especially in the energy range of interest .",
    "we also note that the two different propagation codes , darksusy and the code of @xcite , gives very good agreement and should not constitute any additional theoretical error .    .",
    "predictions spread over the yellow band as the cosmic ray propagation parameters are varied from the minimal to maximal configurations .",
    "the long - dashed black curve is calculated with darksusy for a standard set of propagation parameters ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the narrow green band stands for the secondary component . as is evident from this figure , the antiproton fluxes for this example model clearly overshoots the data.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    -0.3 cm    notice finally that the primary yellow uncertainty band is at least an order of magnitude above the secondary green component .",
    "the latter alone can already account for the antiproton observations as is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbar_prim_vs_sec ] .",
    "we conclude that the supersymmetric model that has been selected here because it provides a good fit to the egret excess should be excluded as it by far overproduces antiprotons . in fig .  [",
    "fig : pbar_prim_vs_sec ] we also compare with the bess data at other energies than our previously selected energy bin .",
    "it should be evident from the figure that the model overproduces antiprotons at essentially every measured energy .",
    "we have here compared with one example model , but this argument can be made more general . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deboer - pbar]b we show with a solid line how far down we could shift the models down by going to the extreme minimal model .",
    "as can be seen , the antiprotons are still overproduced by a factor of 210 for the models with good fits to egret data .",
    "it is therefore difficult to see how the dark matter interpretation of the egret data could be compatible with the antiproton measurements .      above we mentioned the antiproton uncertainties coming from our lack of knowledge of the propagation model .",
    "we also have uncertainties arising from the assumptions in the approach of de boer et al .",
    "e.g. , the boost factor is assumed to be independent of position in the galaxy .",
    "this is probably not a very well - justified assumption as we would expect the boost factor to depend on the formation history of that particular region in the galaxy .",
    "if the boost factors do depend on the position in the galaxy , then the boost factors for the flux at _ reception _ at earth can be different for gamma rays and antiprotons since the signal in general come from different parts of the galaxy ( the gamma signal can e.g.  be dominated by annihilation at the galactic center , whereas the antiprotons could come from a more nearby structure ) .",
    "we will here investigate what the uncertainties on the boost of the antiproton flux _ as seen at the earth _ could be if we relax the assumption of space - independent boost factors .",
    "in particular , galactic tidal interactions should destroy clumps@xcite in the inner ( older ) parts of the milky way and especially in the inner ring , which is the most prominent feature in the de boer model when it comes to the fits to the gamma - ray fluxes . on the other hand ,",
    "the antiprotons that are detected at the earth originate from a broad region of the milky way halo .",
    "a significant portion is produced in the inner ring , but a substantial part comes also from the outskirts where clumps have survived . the correct _ effective _ boost factor which should have been implemented in the antiproton calculations should therefore probably be larger than the value derived from assuming a spatially constant boost factor .",
    "we can quantify these uncertainties though .",
    "if we take away the inner ring , the antiproton fluxes goes down a factor of 2.0 .",
    "if we take away the outer ring , the antiproton fluxes go down by a factor of 1.4 . and ,",
    "finally , if we would take away the smooth triaxial halo , the antiproton fluxes would go down by a factor of 2.2 .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the antiproton fluxes at the earth are dominated by annihilation in the inner ring and the smooth triaxial halo .",
    "since the antiprotons coming from the inner ring originate in the same place as the gamma rays that dominate the flux in region a , the boost factor derived from the gamma flux should be very close to the _ effective _ boost factor for these antiprotons .",
    "as noted above , this makes up half of the antiproton flux at earth . for the other half , coming mostly from the triaxial smooth halo , our use of the same _ effective _ boost factor as derived from gamma rays from region a is most likely not correct .",
    "however , as noted above , we would expect the boost factor to be larger in these less dense regions , so our ( and de boer s ) assumption of space independent boost factors would lead to an underestimate of the antiproton flux .    another argument ",
    "slightly more technical  points in the same direction .",
    "the _ local _ boost factor @xmath10 of a clump of mass @xmath11 is defined  @xcite with respect to some value of reference @xmath12 through the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dark matter density inside the substructure .",
    "if large boost factors are needed to explain the egret data , this means that the dark matter is tightly packed even inside the inner ring .",
    "that region is already fairly dense with a density of reference @xmath15 gev @xmath16 . on the contrary ,",
    "antiprotons originate from a larger domain where the neutralino density is certainly smaller on average than inside the inner ring . if the clumps have basically the same mass and density profile all over the milky way halo  which is probably correct in the case where very small substructures dominate , as they should have survived the galactic tides  the product @xmath17 remains constant . we are forced to the conclusion that the actual _ effective _ boost value which should be used for antiprotons is once again larger than in the case of the egret data . therefore assuming identical _ effective _ boost factors ( as seen at earth ) for the photon and antiproton flux is very conservative .",
    "the lower antiproton limit featured in fig .  [ fig : deboer - pbar]b should actually be shifted upwards , even further above the bess 98 stripes .",
    "with the enhanced dark matter densities in the de boer et al .",
    "model one may wonder if these models would nt have been seen already in direct detection experiments . to make a simple estimate of this , we plot the scattering cross section on protons versus mass in fig .  [ fig : deboer - dir ] .",
    "we compare with the latest cdms results @xcite , but since those results apply for a local dark matter density of @xmath18 gev/@xmath19 , we have rescaled the limits with the local density in the de boer et al .  model . to be more specific ,",
    "we have lowered the limits by @xmath20 , which is the ratio of the local dark matter density in the de boer et al .",
    "model and a ` standard ' halo model . as can be seen",
    ", most models would seem to be excluded by the latest cdms results @xcite .",
    "however , in deriving these limits , a standard gaussian velocity distribution has been assumed .",
    "this is most probably a reasonable approximation for the triaxial halo in the de boer et al .",
    "model , but most of the local density comes from the inner ring , where not much is known about the velocity . if the inner ring would rotate along with the galaxy , we expect lower rates than indicated in the figure since the relative velocity between the dark matter and us would be lower . however , if it counter - rotates , we would expect even higher rates .",
    "if we would be conservative and assume that the inner ring would produce no significant rates in direct detection experiments , the limits from cdms would be reduced by a factor of @xmath21 ( as the local density from the smooth halo is 0.5 gev/@xmath19 in the de boer et al .",
    "model ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deboer - dir ] we indicate this exclusion limit with a dashed line .",
    "as can be seen , some of the models of them would then fall below the exclusion limit , but some would still be above .    hence , one can conclude that the de boer et al .",
    "models produce significant rates in direct detection experiments , and some of the good models are already excluded even if uncertainties of the velocity distributions are taken into account .",
    "however , we can not exclude all of the good models , due to these uncertainties , but many of the models giving the best fits are well within reach with future improved direct detection experiments .",
    "we have here investigated the idea put forward by de boer et al.that the observed egret excess of diffuse gamma rays could be due to dark matter annihilation in the milky way .",
    "this is an interesting idea , but as far as we can see the model does not seem very plausible when other constraints are taken into account .",
    "the strongest constraint is probably the antiproton flux , which would be overproduced far above the flux measured by bess . even if the uncertainties of the antiproton flux are included , the antiproton flux is still more than a factor of 210 above the bess measurements . from the analysis in this paper one also find ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : deboer - pbar]b ) that models that would be compatible with the antiproton data would always have very bad fits to the egret data ( reduced @xmath22 @xmath23 60/6 ) .",
    "actually , the optimized background model in @xcite would produce a much better fit ( reduced @xmath22 @xmath24 22/6 ; which can also be read of at the high - mass end in fig .",
    "[ fig : deboer - boost]b , where the signal does not contribute much to the fits )",
    ". hence , the models with acceptable antiproton fluxes are not very interesting as they give worse fits to the gamma excess than the more conventional models .",
    "other objections to the model come from astrophysics .",
    "e.g. , the density in the disc in the de boer model is a little bit too high to be compatible with stellar motions in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this could of course be circumvented by adjusting the densities in the de boer et al .",
    "model to have a dip at our location in the solar system .",
    "such fine tunings are not very appealing though , especially as the model already as it stands has a local minimum at the solar neighborhood .",
    "one has to be careful interpreting these results on the disc surface density though as there are large uncertainties and model dependencies . to be conservative",
    ", we interpret these too high disc surface mass densities as a hint of problems with the model .",
    "the actual density profiles of the rings ( exponential fall - off away from the disc ) is also not what you expect from dark matter .",
    "in fact , we believe that the de boer et al .  model is most likely a fit of the _ baryonic _ matter distribution of the galaxy , and not the dark matter density .",
    "one could also wonder if the background models could be improved further and provide a even better fit to the egret data .",
    "in fact , the optimized background model in @xcite already gives a good fit to the egret data  especially when conventional / larger uncertainties of for egret s observed gamma fluxes are adopted ( reduced @xmath22 @xmath24 5/6 ) .",
    "this optimized model was accomplished by tuning the electron and proton injection spectrum without violating any of the cosmic ray constraints , such as b / c .",
    "hence , there is no real need for dark matter to explain the egret data .",
    "new experiments are on their way though with glast flying in 2007 and with new and better data , we will hopefully get a better understanding of the gamma - ray sky and if there are any ( clear ) signals of dark matter out there .",
