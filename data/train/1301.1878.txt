    "there are galaxies hiding a compact luminous source in their nuclei and is their local prototype . the extremely extinguished power source in this early - type disk galaxy",
    "was first recognized by @xcite who singled out the galaxy for its infrared brightness .",
    "they found very deep silicate absorption at 9.7  toward the infrared - bright nucleus and deduced that the source of the infrared luminosity ( @xmath0 ) is completely obscured by a dust shroud of  @xmath4 50 mag .",
    "they further inferred from the weakness of line features in the infrared and optical spectra that the luminosity source is an accreting massive black hole ( i.e. , active galactic nucleus or agn ) , although they also mentioned a nascent starburst embedded within a dusty cocoon as a possible alternative .",
    "subsequent observations to be reviewed in  [ s.n4418review ] have supported the presence of a deeply buried compact luminosity source , although its nature is still debated .",
    "ngc 4418 is the most absorption - dominated galaxy in the mid - infrared diagnostic diagram of @xcite .",
    "its location on the diagonal branch in the diagram suggests that the luminosity source is almost completely covered by opaque dust .",
    "usual spectroscopic signs of agn can be completely extinguished by this heavy absorption .",
    "hence , the main piece of evidence for a hidden agn , among other indirect ones , has been the compactness of the source inferred from the absorption depth .",
    "it has been argued that dust is unlikely to cover an extended starburst so completely as to cause the deep absorption features @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the arguments for very young starburst are based on the low radio to far infrared ratio and the detection of a warm molecular gas absorber toward the nucleus .",
    "the former ratio is lower than in radio - quiet agns and is consistent with a starburst in the pre - supernova age ( @xmath5 5 myr ) @xcite .",
    "the absorbing molecules appear to be in the region where x - rays would have destroyed them if the heating is due to an agn @xcite .",
    "the true nature of the luminous nucleus is important because this type of heavily extinguished nuclei could double the number of local agn @xcite or it could represent a young phase of unusually intense and compact starburst ( @xmath6 100 pc ) .",
    "luminous hidden nuclei of this kind are also important because they may be in a short transition phase to unobscured agns , i.e. , in the process of removing the obscuring gas ( e.g. , through an agn - driven outflow , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such feedback is regarded as a key process in galaxy evolution and hence requires detailed study @xcite .    a new approach to characterize and diagnose the compact , luminous , and extinguished nuclei of this kind is through submillimeter - wave observations at high spatial resolution .",
    "sub - mm observations directly probe the thermal dust emission that constitutes most of the bolometric luminosity of such a nucleus .",
    "unlike optical and infrared observations , one can look deep into the obscuring material since dust opacity decreases at longer wavelengths .",
    "radio interferometry is available in the sub - mm to achieve sub - arcsec resolution that is currently unavailable in far - ir where the radiation of such a nucleus peaks .",
    "it is possible to estimate the bolometric luminosity and luminosity density of the nucleus using the stefan - boltzmann law by measuring the source size and brightness temperature at a frequency where the nucleus has a photosphere .",
    "one can also probe the nucleus by measuring its mass from rotation of circumnuclear molecular gas , which can be observed using sub - mm molecular lines .",
    "the luminosity - to - mass ratio , / , so obtained will further constrain the nature of the nucleus since an agn can have a higher @xmath3 than stars .",
    "molecular lines can provide additional information on temperature , density , chemical composition of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and on the radial motion of the gas affecting the evolution of the dusty shroud .",
    "we had applied this approach to the ultraluminous infrared galaxy , which shares some of the above mentioned characteristics of ngc 4418 including the deep silicate absorption .",
    "we found that the brighter one of the twin nuclei of arp 220 has @xmath7  and /@xmath8",
    "/  in the central 80 pc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s08 ) and that each nucleus has a molecular outflow causing molecular p - cygni profiles @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the same approach to ngc 4418 to quantitatively constrain the nature of the deeply extinguished nucleus through sub - mm high - resolution observations .",
    "we made the first sub - arcsecond resolution imaging of the galaxy in the submillimeter band , observing 860  continuum and molecular lines including co(32 ) , hcn(43 ) , and ( 43 ) and also imaging the nucleus with 450  continuum .",
    "we also analyzed optical multi - color images to probe circumnuclear dust distribution for signs of disturbance and feedback .",
    "the obtained parameters of the nucleus are similar to the ones in arp 220 .",
    "they are consistent with any of the following being energetically dominant : an agn , a young and compact starburst , and an agn - compact starburst combination .",
    "our results support the previous studies using an independent method and indicate a possible path to break the degeneracy about the luminosity source with future observations of higher quality .",
    "we also found a sign of outflow from the nucleus in the optical data . in the following ,",
    "we briefly review properties of ngc 4418 and previous studies on the hidden nucleus in ",
    "[ s.n4418review ] .",
    "we describe our sma observations in  [ s.obs ] and present the results in  [ s.result ] , where we also report our examination of optical images of the galaxy .",

    "( 1 ) a high infrared - to - optical luminosity ratio @xmath9 @xcite and the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) suggest that most of the luminosity of the galaxy is absorbed and reradiated by dust as thermal emission @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) ngc 4418 has warm mid - ir and far - ir colors @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the former puts the galaxy in the ` warm ' population that often host active nuclei @xcite .",
    "the latter also suggests warm dust ( color temperature of 50 k ) indicative of reprocessed dust emission .",
    "( 3 ) the deep absorption has been confirmed by further spectroscopy and modeling ; the estimated opacity is @xmath12 or  100 mag @xcite .",
    "a radial gradient of temperature in the nucleus may also contribute to the deep 10  depression in the same way @xcite modeled for protostars @xcite .",
    "it is also suggested from a shallow sed slope in the fir that the dust has a high enough column density to be optically thick even at or beyond 100  @xcite .",
    "likely related to this is an unusually low ratio of the [ ] 158  line to far - ir luminosity in ngc 4418 @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the compactness of the infrared nucleus has been directly confirmed with mid - ir imaging at subarcsecond resolutions @xcite . according to the keck imaging by @xcite , the 10  size of the nucleus is 03 and the 25  size is less than 06 , which is the diffraction limit of the 10 m telescope .",
    "( 5 ) the nucleus is also compact ( 0104 ) and has a high brightness temperature ( @xmath13 k ) at 2 ghz ( @xcite ) . such a radio nucleus is either an active nucleus or a compact starburst or their hybrid @xcite . (",
    "6 ) chandra x - ray observations `` may imply the presence of a compton - thick agn '' although the identification is `` somewhat tentative '' because of the limited photon statistics @xcite . ( 7 ) ngc 4418 has far - ir excess compared to its radio strength , attributed either to a dust - enshrouded agn or to a young , compact starburst @xcite .",
    "( 8) molecular gas concentration to the central @xmath14 5  has been observed with interferometers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the mass of the molecular gas will be about @xmath15   if the average conversion factor in our galaxy @xcite applies to the observed co(10 ) flux of @xmath16 jy  @xcite .",
    "ngc 4418 has a high infrared luminosity - to - molecular gas mass ratio of @xmath17 for the above  @xcite .",
    "high - excitation molecular lines with excitation temperatures above 100 k have been detected toward the nucleus ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the last four publications report vibrationally excited molecules and the last three report lines involving energy levels as high as 1000 k. ( 9 ) redshifted absorption lines have been found toward the nucleus by @xcite in the mid - infrared and oh lines and by @xcite in the 21 cm line .",
    "these are attributed to a gas inflow .",
    "we observed ngc 4418 in 2009 , 2010 , and 2012 at around 350 ghz ( 860 ) using the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "we used the subcompact ( sc ) , extended ( ext ) , and very extended ( vex ) array configurations .",
    "observational parameters are in table [ t.obslog ] .",
    "the data from the sc configuration were already reported in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s10 ) and are combined here with the new data .",
    "the overall coverage of baseline lengths is 6509 m or 7590 k@xmath18 at 350 ghz for the galaxy .",
    "we simultaneously observed co(32 ) and ( 43 ) lines in 2009 and co(32 ) and hcn(43 ) in 2010 using 2 ghz of bandwidth .",
    "we used in the ext and sc configurations 4 ghz bandwidth to simultaneously observe co(32 ) , ( 43 ) , and hcn(43 ) .",
    "the sma primary beam covers about 34  ( 5.6 kpc ) in full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at our observing frequencies .",
    "the sma spectrocorrelator was configured to the resolution of 3.25 mhz ( about 3 ) and recorded data from both upper and lower sidebands ( usb and lsb ) .",
    "we used 3c273 for our gain , passband , and pointing calibrations .",
    "we also observed the quasar j1222 + 042 and titan in our 2010 vex observations for further calibration and its verification .",
    "flux calibration was made using titan and ganymede in 2009 , and titan in 2010 and 2012 .",
    "the angular distances from our gain calibrator 3c273 to ngc 4418 , j1222 + 042 , and titan in our 2010 observations , were only 3.0 , 2.7 , and 4.0 degrees , respectively .",
    "this mitigated calibration errors due to direction - dependent phase de - correlation , atmospheric transmission , and pointing offsets .",
    "we reduced our data using mir for calibration @xcite , miriad for imaging @xcite , and aips @xcite and stand - alone programs for further data analyses .",
    "the data were first imaged at 30  resolution for the entire bandwidths to identify lines . then the ` line - free ' channels were identified and integrated to create continuum data .",
    "that continuum is then subtracted from the original to make continuum - subtracted visibilities .",
    "the spectra and the identified lines are presented in  [ s.result.spectra ] .",
    "the line data were further analyzed after binning to 1030  resolutions .",
    "we did self - calibration of phase using the continuum data when making images from the vex data , although we did not do that when measuring the source position or fitting the visibilities to determine the size and flux density of the continuum source .",
    "table [ t.data ] summarizes the properties of the images and spectral data cubes used in this paper .",
    "we also observed the galaxy at 660 ghz ( 450 ) during our vex 350 ghz observations in 2009 and 2010 by allocating 2 ghz of correlator bandwidth to our high frequency receivers .",
    "only the 2010 run resulted in useable data from five antennas .",
    "atmospheric absorption was significant at our observing frequency even though the weather condition was excellent for mauna kea .",
    "the mean zenith opacity was 0.038 at 225 ghz and 0.89 at 350  during our observations according to the monitoring at the adjacent caltech submillimeter observatory .",
    "the opacity should be about the same at 450 and 350 .",
    "the median double sideband ( dsb ) system temperature was about 1200 k toward ngc 4418 .",
    "we used 3c273 for both passband and gain calibration .",
    "both 350 ghz and 660 ghz data were used for the gain calibration .",
    "we first applied the 350 ghz gain solution with its phase multiplied by the ratio of the observing frequencies , 1.9 , and then derived another gain solution using the 660 ghz data and applied it to improve the calibration .",
    "no strong line is in our passband and the data are treated as continuum . since titan is too heavily resolved , flux calibration at 660 ghz is based on the 350 ghz flux density of 3c273 scaled to 660 ghz using the spectral index of @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate our flux measurements at 660 ghz to be accurate only to 36% ( for @xmath20 = 0.3 and 30% error for other calibrations ) .",

    "both are from vibrationally excited .",
    "namely , ( @xmath25=@xmath26,j=3938 ) is at = 356.072 ghz and has its upper energy level at @xmath27 k. ( @xmath28=@xmath29,j=3938 ) is at = 355.278 ghz and has @xmath30 k. the doublet counterpart of the former line ( @xmath25=@xmath29,j=3938 ) was already identified at = 355.566 ghz in @xcite .",

    "although unidentified , there may be more lines , e.g. , at  343.4 and 357.5 ghz ; species having a line at the former frequency include h@xmath32cs and hoco@xmath33 .",
    "the 350 ghz continuum in each sideband was made by averaging the following channels .",
    "for the vex data we used channels outside of 19002300  for co(32 ) , hcn(43 ) , ( 43 ) , ( 43 ) , , ( 43 ) , cs(76 ) , and ( 3938 ) and ( 3837 ) .",
    "for the ext and sc data we excluded channels having velocities of 18502350  for the same lines plus ( @xmath25=@xmath26,j=3938 ) and ( @xmath25=@xmath29,j=3938 ) , channels between co(32 ) and its nearest band edge , and the same for hcn(43 ) .",

    "we show this below using maps , aperture photometry , and visibility fitting .",
    "figure [ f.cochan_subextvex ] shows co(32 ) channel maps to display faint extended emission at 06 resolution .",
    "the data cube was made by combining all our data .",
    "we detected here @xmath34 jy  or @xmath35 % of the single - dish co(32 ) flux observed in the central 14  of the galaxy by @xcite . despite the high recovery rate , the co(32 )",
    "emission was detected only in the central 6  ( 1 kpc ) of the galaxy , showing that the extent of the co(32 ) emission is intrinsically smaller than our 34  ( 5.6 kpc ) field of view .",
    "the co emission is not only compact but also strongly peaked toward the nucleus within the central kpc . in this data",
    "set more than half ( 58 % ) of the co(32 ) flux in the central kpc is in the central 165 pc ( 1 , fwhm ) .",
    "figures [ f.vexcochan ] and [ f.vexhcnchan ] respectively are co(32 ) and hcn(43 ) channel maps at 03 ( 50 pc ) resolutions showing that the line emission is strongly peaked at the nucleus at subarcsecond ( @xmath36100 pc ) scales .",
    "these data cubes were made from the vex data alone .",
    "this co(32 ) data cube contains about 50% of the co flux detected in our 06 resolution data .    our continuum and",
    "line moment maps are shown in figs .",
    "[ f.sevcomom ] and [ f.vexmaps ] .",
    "the spatial resolutions are about 06 and 03 for 350 ghz data and",
    "02 for 660 ghz continuum .",
    "in particular , fig . [ f.vexmaps ]",
    "( k ) and ( l ) show our detection of a compact continuum source at the galactic center .",
    "the continuum position is listed in table [ t.4418param ] and agrees to 03 with the optical and radio positions of the nucleus ; see the caption of table [ t.4418param ] for the optical position and @xcite for the radio position .",
    "the degree of central concentration , or compactness , is compared among various lines and continuum at 350 ghz in table [ t.param ] using the ratio of flux ( or flux density ) between the central 05 ( 80 pc ) and 6  ( 1 kpc ) .",
    "the former photometry is made using our data from the vex configuration and the latter data are from @xcite that used the sc configuration .",
    "the ratios for various emission components indicate their relative compactness . the relatively extended nature of co(32 ) emission is evident from its low ratio .",
    "only one third of the co(32 ) emission is from the central 05 .",
    "lines other than co have higher flux ratios , and hence are more concentrated toward the nucleus .",
    "the ratio for 860  continuum , @xmath37 , is the highest among the ratios with s / n @xmath38 3 in table [ t.param ] .",
    "thus 860  continuum emission is more compact than both the co and non - co high excitation lines . at the same time , the continuum emission in the vex data is slightly more extended than the 03 synthesized beam as seen in the last two panels of fig . [ f.vexcochan ] .",
    "the detected 450  continuum also looks compact but it has only a minor fraction of single - dish measurement .",
    "figure [ f.visfit ] ( a)(c ) show fits to the continuum visibilities of ngc 4418 , a test point source j1222042 , and titan whose subarcsecond size is known .",
    "the fit results are listed in table [ t.visfit ] . for ngc 4418 ,",
    "data from the three array configurations are combined .",
    "this can not be done for the calibrators because their flux densities and the apparent diameter of titan change with time .",
    "since the ngc 4418 data were taken in three different nights the three data sets should have independent flux calibration errors , which are typically about 1020% for the sma 350 ghz observations .",
    "however , we did not add the flux scaling error in the plot and in our fitting because doing so would make the reduced @xmath39 well below unity .",
    "it is most likely that we achieved better flux calibration than usual , presumably because we had accurate pointing from repeated pointing on the bright quasar 3c273 next to ngc 4418 , our primary flux calibrator titan was also close to 3c273 and ngc 4418 , and atmospheric absorption was low ( 225 ghz zenith opacity @xmath40 for all the three nights ) .",
    "the size of 850  continuum emission of ngc 4418 obtained from our data is 010 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we will use this for the source modeling in ",
    "[ s.param_cont_core ] .",
    "we verified our visibility fitting using the quasar j1222042 and titan .",
    "they were gain calibrated using 3c273 in the same way as ngc 4418 was calibrated .",
    "our fit of j1222042 using a gaussian shows that blurring of the point source was less than 50 milli arcsec ( mas ) in our observations .",
    "the diameter of titan at 860  is known to be 5230 km or 08425 for the distance of 8.5588 au .",
    "this size includes the 40 km altitude of the tropopause , around which is the sub - mm photosphere of titan .",
    "the distance at the time of our 2010 vex observations is from jpl - horizons .",
    "[ f.visfit ] ( c ) shows that our data match the expected visibility curve very well with only flux scaling .",
    "when the data were fit for both the source size and amplitude scaling , we obtained the size of the sub - arcsecond source with an accuracy better than 3% or to 20 mas .",
    "the flux density of titan sets the absolute amplitude scaling of all the visibility fitting .",
    "we adopt the continuum brightness temperature of 77 k as the planck temperature that gives the total flux density of titan for the solid - surface diameter ( 5150 km ) of the satellite ( m. gurwell , private communication ) .",
    "our titan data do not contain co(32 ) and hcn(43 ) lines , both of which are known to be bright .",
    "still , our imperfect knowledge of the atmosphere of titan may introduce a common amplitude error to our data even though the relative calibration using titan is precise and consistent among the three data sets .",
    "we therefore assign 5% to the overall flux scaling uncertainty of our ngc 4418 fit , even though the formal error in the fitting was about 1% .",
    "in addition to this , there is likely contamination of line emission to the ` line - free ' channels used for the usb continuum of the galaxy .",
    "we observed a sign of that in our sc configuration data in the form of an uncomfortably large spectral index @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) between the two sidebands ( @xcite ) .",
    "a similar sign was seen in our 2010 vex data too . since we used the usb continuum in the multi - configuration fitting as lsb data were noisier , the line contamination is likely in the fitted amplitude . its effect on the luminosity estimate is addressed in ",
    "[ s.tb_lbol ] .",
    "[ f.visfit ] also shows visibility amplitudes of line emission against baseline lengths .",
    "line visibilities were averaged over 19002300  after continuum subtraction , and then binned according to the baseline length .",
    "it is evident in the figure that the line visibility amplitudes decline faster than the continuum amplitudes .",
    "in other words , line emission is more extended than continuum .",
    "comparison of co , hcn , and  data tells us that the co emission is more extended than the latter two , confirming our observation using the aperture photometry .",
    "moreover , the co visibility plot shows that the data can not be fit with a single gaussian in the  domain .",
    "hence the spatial distribution of the co(32 ) emission is not a gaussian .",
    "the line emission distribution has at least a compact subarcsecond peak toward the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ f.vexmaps ] ) and an extended component with the total extent of 5  ( fig .",
    "[ f.sevcomom ] ) .",
    "the extended component is non - axisymmetric around the nucleus ( fig . [ f.sevcomom ] ) .",
    "the continuum sed has a power - law slope of @xmath43 ( @xmath42 ) between 1.3 mm and 0.85 mm .",
    "this is measured from the sma data in figure [ f.sed ] , namely from this work , @xcite , and the 1.3 and 1.1 mm observations used in the companion paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the sma continuum data were taken from line - free spectrometer channels in each dataset , none of the sma data is contaminated by strong emission lines such as co unlike wide - band bolometer data .",
    "the spectral slope that we obtained is shallower ( i.e. , @xmath44 is smaller ) than those of other local ir luminous galaxies but is consistent with the results of the fir - to - mm sed surveys of @xcite and @xcite , in each of which ngc 4418 has the shallowest spectral slope in about 15 galaxies .",
    "two simple models for the spectral index suggest that the @xmath44 measured at the nucleus is due to the dust opacity @xmath45 at @xmath46 mm . in the first model of a simple one - zone slab ,",
    "the spectral slope should be @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the index of power - law frequency dependence of the dust opacity and @xmath49 is the slab opacity at the wavelength of the @xmath44 measurement .",
    "here we used the rayleigh - jeans approximation because the brightness temperature of the 01 nucleus exceeds 100 k as we will see next (  [ s.tb_lbol ] ) . with optically thin emission",
    ", this model gives the familiar form of @xmath50 .",
    "the low @xmath44 observed in ngc 4418 means low @xmath48 or a moderate opacity of dust emission , i.e. , @xmath45 at @xmath46 mm .",
    "the dust opacity about 1 is favored , as was concluded by @xcite , because most infrared luminous galaxies have @xmath51@xmath52 @xcite . the observed @xmath44 corresponds to @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "for the second model , we note that the sed slope does not become 2 at shorter wavelengths as expected for @xmath57 .",
    "the shallower slope of the planck function compared to the rayleigh - jeans formula must partly be the reason .",
    "another likely reason is that the dust distribution is not just a 01 slab of uniform opacity but presumably has a low opacity halo as suggested by the larger extent of line emission than the 860  continuum .",
    "the spectral slope in the general multi - component case without mutual shielding is the flux - weighted mean of the spectral indexes , @xmath58 , where the @xmath59th component has the flux density @xmath60 and spectral index @xmath61 . for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "the observed @xmath44 corresponds to a fraction of the optically thick core of @xmath64 % .",
    "thus as long as we assume @xmath65 , we need an optically thick core ( @xmath66 ) that dominates the spectral energy distribution at @xmath46 mm .",
    "in addition to the two models , the high opacity is also supported by the high brightness temperature that sets a lower limit of about 0.1 to the 860  opacity from the constraint that opacity - corrected brightness temperature can not exceed dust sublimation temperature .",
    "there are other factors that depend on frequency and potentially affect the spectral index .",
    "they include the core size defined with the @xmath67 surface , the dust temperature at the photosphere , and absorption of the core emission by dust around it . the last one is addressed in  [ s.450cont ] .",
    "the dust continuum opacity @xmath68 of the core translates to a hydrogen column density @xmath69   for the dust opacity to column density relation @xmath70 h - atom @xcite . since the core has a size of 20 pc ( 01 in fwhm from ",
    "[ s.visfit_line ] ; see the next subsection for two models ) , we obtain @xmath71 for the mean gas density ( i.e. , number density of hydrogen molecules ) and @xmath72  for the total gas mass in the core assuming that the gas is mostly molecular there .",
    "the total mass depends on the density distribution .",
    "the estimate above is for a uniform density and is an upper limit if the gas density increases toward the center .",
    "table [ t.lbol ] lists the deconvolved ( peak ) brightness temperature and the bolometric luminosity of the nucleus .",
    "the luminosity is derived from the 860  core size and the temperature .",
    "here we use two different models to estimate the brightness temperature and the bolometric luminosity of the nucleus as we did in @xcite for arp 220 .",
    "one is the circular gaussian we used for the visibility fit above and the other is a circular disk with uniform brightness .",
    "the gaussian model describes dust that is not fully opaque across the nucleus and that may also have a radial temperature gradient .",

    "the errors here and in table [ t.lbol ] are random errors due to the 5% flux error and the 11% size uncertainty and do not include systematic error due to the models .",
    "there are two notable sources of systematic errors in the derived parameters in addition to the assumptions on the source shape and on the 860  opacity .",
    "( the underestimating effect of the latter is minor as noted in @xcite . )",
    "one is the absorption of the core emission by the surrounding dust and gas .",
    "it arises because the 01 ( 20 pc ) continuum core is embedded in an order of magnitude larger envelope as we saw in  [ s.gas_dust_concentration ] .",
    "the continuum emission from the core must suffer from extinction to some extent by the envelope through continuum self - absorption and line absorption by various molecules .",
    "our continuum brightness temperature derived without the extinction correction is therefore a lower limit of the true brightness temperature at the surface of the 01 core .",
    "the correction for it would increase the core luminosity .",
    "we will analyze this submillimeter extinction a little more in  [ s.450cont ] and find the extinction to be about 5% at 860 .",
    "the other source of systematic error is the possible contamination of the 860  continuum by molecular lines .",
    "this effect can be estimated to be about 10% assuming that the spectral index between lower and upper sidebands obtained in the sc configuration , @xmath78 (  [ s.visfit_cont ] ) , is due to line contamination to the usb data and that the true continuum spectral index is @xmath79 (  [ s.sed ] ) .",
    "the continuum brightness temperature of the core would be lower without the contamination .",

    "thermal lines can significantly add flux density to the 860  continuum only when the line and continuum opacities satisfy @xmath80 and @xmath81 , because no thermal line will be seen from a blackbody .",

    "the plausible gas motion mentioned here is opposite to that in arp 220 where p - cygni profiles of molecular lines suggested molecular outflows @xcite .",

    "first , the co(32 ) line has a peak brightness temperature of 90 k at 03 resolution ( table [ t.param ] ) , indicating warm molecular gas around the nucleus .",

    "meanwhile both hcn(43 ) and ( 43 ) have peak brightness temperatures of about 30 k at the same 03 resolution ( table [ t.param ] ) .",
    "their 3 times lower  than that of co must be largely due to beam dilution effects for these lines because they were found more compact than co(32 ) in  [ s.gas_dust_concentration ] .",
    "subthermal excitation and lower opacities of hcn and  may be additional reasons for the lower  of these lines .",
    "second , the detection of lines from vibrationally excited molecules is another indication of high temperatures in the nucleus .",
    "the hcn and  lines that we detected from their vibrationally excited states have upper energy levels 5101070 k above the ground level .",
    "vibrational temperatures of these molecules have been estimated to be around 300 k ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "infrared radiation has been suggested to play a significant role for the vibrational excitation in the 100200 k gas and dust that we inferred from brightness temperatures .",
    "our companion paper ( @xcite ) presents a more detailed analysis and discussion on the excitation .",
    "third , the mean gas density @xmath71  of the 20 pc core (  [ s.nh_mgass ] ) is high enough for co excitation to j=3 but not for hcn and  to j=4 .",
    "their critical densities for collisional excitation at 100 k are @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the mean density is also far short of the @xmath0  critical density to vibrationally excite hcn with  collisions .",
    "therefore the excitation of the lines with high critical densities are probably achieved through photon trapping , non - uniform density distribution to allow higher local densities than the mean , mid - infrared radiation , and/or electron collisions ( @xcite ) .",
    "fourth , the ratios between lines and between line and continuum vary with the area size of the measurements in the way expected when the interstellar medium is warmer and denser at smaller radii . this is a consequence of the size variation among various emission lines (  [ s.gas_dust_concentration ] ) . for example the hcn(43)/co(32 ) ratio of integrated brightness temperatures is @xmath112 and @xmath113 at 05 and 6  apertures , respectively .",
    "the ratio is expected to be higher when molecular gas is denser , warmer , or favorable for hcn line emission in other ways .",

    "the co(32 ) equivalent width changes by a factor of 3 , between @xmath114 and @xmath115 , from 05 to 6  scales .",

    "[ f.sevcomom ] .",
    "we interpret the red feature to be an outflow cone emanating from the galactic center along the rotation axis of the galaxy .",
    "the feature is very unlikely to be a structure on the galactic plane because such a feature would be torn by differential rotation and also because the feature is on the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "the minor axis is determined by our viewpoint while a radial feature in the galactic plane should have no preferred position angle with respect to us .",
    "the outflow cone model does not have this problem because any feature along the rotation axis of the galaxy is always projected onto the minor axis .",
    "also , the outflow can be bipolar in this model even though we only see half of it in the color index map .",
    "the fact that we see the red feature only on the northwestern side suggests the side to be the near side of the outflow and the far side of the galaxy disk , against which the outflow cone is visible as a red silhouette due to color - dependent extinction .",

    "the velocity shift suggests radial motion of the ionized gas along the polar axis .",
    "although we can not yet confirm an _ outward _ radial motion because the direction of the [ ] velocity shift was not given , the velocity shift along the red cone better fits the outflow interpretation . for this radial motion to be",
    "an inflow , gas and dust need to be falling in the u - shape cone toward the nucleus along the polar axis , which seems too much of a coincidence .",

    "the mass in the entire outflow is twice the last value on the assumption of a symmetric bipolar structure .",
    "this mass estimate assumes foreground - screen extinction .",
    "the 860  dust core mixed with stars in the galactic center does not contribute much to the reddening and , appropriately , to the mass estimated here .",
    "note that the reddening data ( and hence the outflow mass estimate from it ) is more sensitive than our co data in which the u - shaped cone is not detected .",
    "the cone would have a co line brightness temperature on the order of only 0.1 k when the outflow gas is 100% molecular , its co - to-  conversion factor is @xmath132 , and the line has a velocity width of 30  at each position .",

    "the parameter @xmath134 is the outflow velocity normalized by 200  and is about unity for the projected minor - axis velocity shear of 200  measured in [ ] .",
    "the age ( i.e. , crossing time ) of the outflow is the ratio between the de - projected size of the outflow cone , 2 kpc , and the outflow velocity .",
    "the mass outflow rate from the nucleus is from the gas mass above and the crossing time .",
    "we caution about the uncertainties in these parameters due to the unknown velocities of various outflow media , the poorly constrained extent of the flow , and the uncertain projection effect .",
    "for example , the ionized gas traced by [ ] and the dust causing the reddening may have different bulk velocities .",
    "also the opening angle of the outflow and the possible bend of the outflow direction add uncertainty to our outflow velocity and to the parameters dependent on it .",
    "for example , if the outflow velocity is as large as 1000  seen in some molecular outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the crossing time will be reduced to 2 myr and the outflow rate will be 20  .",
    "another caution is that , with the velocity information currently at hand , we can not tell whether the gas and dust blown out from the nucleus to @xmath135 kpc above the galactic plane will leave the galaxy or fall back to it . in the latter case , the mass loss rate of the galaxy is smaller than the outflow rate from the nucleus .",

    "the gas mass is not negligible since it was estimated to be about half of the dynamical mass (  [ s.nh_mgass ] ) .",
    "removing these from the denominator of the observed @xmath145  will increase the ratio to @xmath1461000 .",

    "the disk at the eddington limit is in the `` hot starburst '' regime and will have a surface brightness of @xmath161 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their equation 7 ) . according to our data and this model ,",
    "the nucleus of ngc 4418 has either an energetically - dominant agn or the hot starburst .",
    "our estimates of the masses in the central 30 pc of ngc 4418 are summarized in table [ t.massbudget ] .",

    "from the viewpoint of mass budget , agn dominance in luminosity would eliminate the need for young stars and help fit the sum of the component masses to the dynamical mass .",

    "this bolometric eddington ratio is high compared to the median ratio of @xmath169 among local type 1 seyferts @xcite . in this sense",
    "the agn mass accretion is rapid in ngc 4418 if the agn is the dominant luminosity source .",
    "the black hole should be growing at a higher rate than in most low luminosity agns",
    ". the mass accretion rate to the black hole would be 0.1  for a 10% radiative efficiency and the luminosity of @xmath148 ( i.e. , @xmath170 ) .",
    "the characteristic time scale for the black hole growth is @xmath111 yr at this rate .",
    "this agn gas consumption rate is much lower than the star formation rate required for the same luminosity because an agn is more fuel - efficient .    a compact young starburst that has a mass @xmath111 , size @xmath171 pc , age  a few myr , and @xmath172  is an alternative that has not been excluded with our observations . ( the age could be up to 10 myr as far as @xmath3 is concerned , but starbursts older than 3 myr are less favored because supernova explosions would be destructive to the dusty core as argued by @xcite . )",
    "while such a starburst would be at an edge of the parameter space allowed for starbursts , it is noteworthy that the massive concentration of dense molecular gas is a favorable environment for star formation .",
    "this is true even if there is a major agn .",
    "a combination of less luminous young starburst and a less luminous agn is also possible as long as their total luminosity is about @xmath0 .",
    "it remains to be seen with more accurate mass , luminosity , and size measurements and the constraints mentioned above whether the nucleus of ngc 4418 is in the parameter region where only a dominant agn is allowed .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether observations at radio wavelengths , which do not suffer from extinction by dust , are consistent with an energetically dominant starburst in the nucleus . as noted in ",
    "[ s.constraint_lm ] , a starburst consistent with our sma observations has a star formation rate of about 30  in the last 3.3 myr so that the starburst population has a stellar mass of @xmath111 , a luminosity to mass ratio of @xmath173 , and the observed luminosity of @xmath174 .",
    "a younger starburst needs higher sfr to achieve the luminosity .",
    "we note that the @xmath175sfr relation of @xcite and @xcite gives sfr @xmath176  for the @xmath148 . however , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ f.l_m ] ( b ) , a continuous starburst at that sfr will be about 10 myr old when achieving the luminosity and by that time the luminosity - to - mass ratio will drop by about 40% from its peak to 600 , assuming the standard kroupa imf . thus , unless the imf is truncated at low masses , our l / m constraint prefers higher sfrs than estimated from the standard @xmath175sfr relation .",
    "we estimate a lower limit of sfr @xmath177  using three constraints from the radio data and an sfr scaling relation of @xcite .",
    "the first constraint is the high brightness temperature of the nucleus , @xmath146@xmath178 k at 2 ghz as reviewed in  [ s.n4418review ] , at the compact nuclear source ( 0104 ) .",
    "this exceeds the temperature of regions ( @xmath179 k ) and hence suggests the dominance of non - thermal synchrotron emission .",
    "the second constraint is from the radio flux densities .",
    "the nucleus has 1.49 ghz ( 20 cm ) and 4.86 ghz ( 6 cm ) flux densities of 38.5 mjy and 26.1 mjy , respectively , from a source with a @xmath180 size @xcite ; the resolutions of these observations are about 04 and 015 , respectively .",
    "the 20 cm luminosity of the nucleus is @xmath181 w  assuming isotropy of the radio emission .",
    "the third constraint is the spectral index between 20 and 6 cm , @xmath182 ( for @xmath183 ) .",
    "it is closer to the spectral index of thermal free - free emission ( @xmath184 ) than to that of non - thermal emission ( @xmath185 ) both from optically thin star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent inconsistency between the first and third constraints can be reconciled if the radio emission is partly opaque , i.e. , if either synchrotron self - absorption or free - free absorption by thermal plasma is significant .",
    "we therefore re - derived the 20 cm flux density using the 6 cm data and a non - thermal spectral index of @xmath186 , while noting that this simplified correction will be insufficient if the 6 cm emission is also opaque .",
    "the corrected 20 cm flux density and luminosity are 67.2 mjy and @xmath187 w , respectively .",
    "the star formation rate of @xmath177  is from this 20 cm luminosity and the formula ( 14 ) of @xcite , which in our case is @xmath188 .",
    "this formula was derived using the proportionality of supernova rate to the star formation rate ( adopting the ratio between them from starburst99 ) and the empirical relation between the supernova rate and the non - thermal radio luminosity .",
    "a similar star formation rate was derived in @xcite from radio data albeit without the opacity correction .",
    "the radio - derived sfr is smaller than needed for the starburst model at the face value .",
    "this may be for the following ( at least ) two reasons _ if _ the starburst model is correct .",
    "first , the radio sfr is a lower limit and can be higher as mentioned above .",
    "second , the sfr may be underestimated because the starburst is very young and is still deficient of supernovae compared to older starbursts for which the sfr formula above was derived .",
    "this nascent starburst is what @xcite argued for from the relative weakness of radio emission compared to the infrared emission in this galaxy and by analyzing radio data in a way similar to ours except that they used lower - resolution data ( beam @xmath189 45 ) .",
    "an obvious weakness of this second explanation is that the dominance of non - thermal emission ( our first constraint ) does not accord with the very young starburst .",
    "the radio emission should be dominated by thermal emission from regions rather than by non - thermal emission from supernovae - induced cosmic rays as long as the nucleus is optically thin at radio wavelengths .",
    "one could still attribute the weak thermal emission to direct absorption of ionizing photons by dust and to high - opacity of the free - free emission .",
    "non - thermal synchrotron emission can be less affected by these owing to the higher penetrating power of cosmic rays than ionizing photons .",
    "these qualitative explanations are not particularly attractive because of their complexity , but we do not yet have a proof to rule them out .    in summary , the lower - limit sfr derived from radio data under the starburst - dominant model is about a factor of three smaller than the lower - limit sfr needed for the luminosity of the nucleus .",
    "although various uncertainties outlined above prevent us from excluding the starburst model , an energetically dominant starburst would need an elaborate model to explain the radio observations .",
    "we also note implications of our new observations to a previous study of this energy source problem .",
    "full reanalysis of all existing observations in light of our new data is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "@xcite used the presumed lack of shocks in the nucleus of this non - merging galaxy and the high hcn - to-  intensity ratio that they obtained toward the nucleus to infer that the warm  they observed in the nucleus is due to x - ray heating .",
    "they then estimated the agn luminosity from the  line luminosity and reached a conclusion that the agn is the dominant energy source in the nucleus .",
    "our discovery of the red cone that we attribute to an outflow from the nucleus , as well as the discovery by @xcite of the blue - shifted absorption presumably due to an inflow , raise the possibility of shock contribution to the infrared  lines .",
    "the hcn - to-  ratio does not give us the fraction of  luminosity due to an agn .",
    "regarding the hcn - to-  ratio itself , while its enhancement around agn gained support from more recent observations at kpc resolutions @xcite , it has been also found to vary within the center of a single galaxy from one giant molecular cloud to another in the range covered by the low - resolution observations of starbursts and agns @xcite .",
    "the latter authors suggested shock enhancement of hcn citing stronger enhancement of hcn than   in the molecular outflow from a protostar @xcite .",
    "in addition , for the particular case of ngc 4418 , our detection and analysis of rotational lines from vibrationally excited hcn toward the nucleus ( @xcite ) further complicate the line ratio analysis by introducing the excitation path through the vibrationally excited state . at present , no estimate exists for the fractional contributions of agn x - rays and other mechanisms to the observed high hcn/  ratio .",
    "thus these recent observations make the assumed 100% contribution of x - ray heating to the  line luminosity uncertain .",
    "therefore the agn luminosity estimated from the  line luminosity is more uncertain than it was at the time @xcite interpreted their data .",
    "this is not to say that the new observations are against the agn hypothesis because the agn dominance can probably still explain the observations and there are new observations that prefer an agn for molecular chemistry in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "as was the case in the radio analysis reviewed above , we have a problem that contributions of multiple ( possible ) mechanisms to observed properties make a conclusive data interpretation difficult .",
    "it seems that we still need to accumulate more constraints to obtain the breakdown of the luminosity sources in the nucleus .",
    "the shroud of the @xmath0  source is a 20 pc core having @xmath190 and the surrounding @xmath146100 pc gas concentration that is generally warmer and denser toward the center .",
    "the compton - thick core has a surface temperature 150 k and a mean density 5@xmath191  (  [ s.nh_mgass ] ) . the radial variation of gas properties is indicated by the emission size sequence of `` co @xmath38 hcn , @xmath38 dust continuum '' (  [ s.gas_dust_concentration ] ) , the continuum properties suggestive of `` dense core @xmath24 diffuse envelope '' structure (  [ s.sed ] and [ s.450cont ] ) , the larger velocity widths of lines with higher critical densities (  [ s.kinematics ] ) , and the dependence of line ratios and equivalent widths on area size (  [ ss.gas_dust_properties ] ) .",
    "the same emission size sequence was observed in arp 220 @xcite .",
    "the declining temperature gradient from the center to larger radii has been an explanation for the deep 9.7  depression in the mid - ir spectrum (  [ s.n4418review ] ) .",
    "our observations on the properties of the central gas concentration are generally consistent with those from the 1 mm observations in our companion paper ( @xcite ) . leaving the comparison between the 1 mm and sub - mm observations to that paper",
    ", we only mention that the deconvolved co(21 ) peak brightness temperature in @xcite is 80 k to agree with the co(32 ) peak  of 90 k and that @xcite also reports radial variation of gas properties .",
    "@xcite made a detailed analysis of the circumnuclear gas properties using herschel spectroscopy at 50200 .",
    "they detected dozens of high - excitation lines , mostly in absorption , from , oh , , hcn , , and their  isotopologues at 100300  resolutions . using these lines",
    ", they made a multi - component model in which the ism is warmer in more compact components .",
    "our observations are consistent with this trend .",
    "there are also agreements on the dust temperature around 150 k at @xmath192 pc and on the higher gas densities in more compact components down to the @xmath192 pc component ( according to ( @xmath193 ) in their table 1 ) .",
    "a difference between their model and our observations is that we detected about 0.2 jy of 860  continuum from a 01 ( 20 pc ) core whereas their model predicts a quarter of that from a component of the same size and about the same temperature ( 150 k ) . our larger flux density and brightness temperature lead us to a larger dust opacity for the core at 860 .",
    "in order for the 50200  and 860  observations to be consistent , it may be that the ism in and around the core is not uniform to allow more leakage of emission from the warmer inner region than expected in the case of uniform shells .",
    "another possibility is that the dust @xmath48 is smaller than 2 .",
    "@xcite also obtained an oxygen isotope abundance comparable to that in the solar neighborhood , [ / ] 500 .",
    "as they noted , the lack of  enhancement through stellar processing is in accord with the luminosity source being an agn and/or young pre - supernova starburst .",
    "the formation and evolution of the the hidden luminous nucleus must be closely linked to those of the massive gas concentration at the nucleus .",
    "it is because the concentrated gas affects the luminosity source and its appearance through fueling and shielding .",
    "the optical morphology of ngc 4418 ( fig .  [ f.sdss ] ) does not show significant disturbance or distortion to suggest a major merger .",
    "there is a blue companion at 3  southeast ( 30 kpc on the sky ) and at about the same redshift ( 2200 ) .",
    "although the two are probably physically associated with each other , the large separation is unlike that in arp 220 whose merger nuclei have a projected separation of only 0.3 kpc . for arp 220",
    "there is no doubt that the concentration of a large amount of gas to each nucleus was a consequence of the dynamical perturbation of the major merger .",
    "in contrast , ngc 4418 does not appear to have acquired its nuclear gas concentration , and hence the nuclear luminosity , through a major merger although some properties of the nucleus are similar to those in arp 220 .",
    "a stellar bar and minor merger are milder mechanisms for gas concentration than major merger and galaxy interaction .",
    "for example , stellar bars are known to transport cold gas in galaxy disks , sometimes as much as @xmath38@xmath111 , to the galactic centers @xcite .",
    "if the gas concentration in ngc 4418 were due to a stellar bar the situation may be similar to the one in the barred spiral galaxy that has a single - peaked concentration of molecular gas with a scale length of 220 pc and a mass of @xmath111   in the central 200 pc @xcite .",
    "the morphological classification of ngc 3504 , ( r)sab(s)ab , is very close to that of ngc 4418 ( table [ t.4418param ] ) including the same moderate bar - type distortion .",
    "currently our data of ngc 4418 show neither a kinematical sign of bar - driven gas dynamics nor any clear sign of recent minor merger , although such signs may be found in the future in the somewhat disorderly gas motion in the central kpc ( fig .",
    "[ f.sevcomom ] ) .",
    "the nuclear gas concentration may also be because most of the gas came from bulge stars .",
    "the gas originated from the galactic bulge through stellar winds and supernovae explosions would have little net angular momentum .",
    "therefore some of it will sink to the galactic center when cooled . a stellar population with a normal initial mass function returns about 30% of its mass to the interstellar space in @xmath194 yr @xcite .",
    "the current bulge mass of ngc 4418 is about @xmath195 , where we used the k band bulge luminosity in  [ s.kinematics ] and the same luminosity to mass ratio as in  [ s.massbudget ]",
    ". the cumulative mass loss from the bulge stars should be therefore about @xmath196 .",
    "stars formed from this gas should have small specific angular momentum and hence further mass loss from them should keep the low specific angular momentum .",
    "the @xmath197  molecular gas currently concentrated to the nucleus may be a fraction of the low angular momentum gas originated this way from the bulge stars .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein for the general molecular gas content in local early type galaxies and discussion on their origins . )",
    "we note two more galaxies that have been recently found to host a compact and massive concentration of molecular gas at their centers .",
    "is an isolated lenticular galaxy that shares infrared characteristics such as the deep 9.7  absorption with ngc 4418 .",
    "@xcite found a single - peaked 100 pc - scale concentration of molecular gas at the nucleus and estimated a total gas mass in the central 400 pc of @xmath111 .",
    "is another lenticular galaxy that has a strong concentration of molecular gas ( @xmath198 ) in the central 100 pc without a clear sign of external disturbance or bar - driven gas transport @xcite .",
    "there may be a common mechanism to cause the compact massive gas concentrations in these galaxies and ngc 4418",
    ". it may be the bulge - origin of the gas as mentioned above since these galaxies have large bulge fractions .",
    "our discovery of an outflow feature from the center of ngc 4418 makes the nucleus to have both an outflow and a previously known inflow .",
    "the inflow has been seen on our sightline near the galactic plane (  [ s.kinematics ] ) and the outflow is perpendicular to the galactic plane ( at least at @xmath38500 pc scales ) . such complex gas motion has been modeled around a galaxy nucleus hosting both starburst and an active nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also simulated an outflow@xmath24inflow system at a smaller scale around a black hole and showed that the system can achieve the eddington luminosity or higher .",
    "while we tentatively estimate the mass outflow rate to be 4  , @xcite estimated an inflow rate of @xmath199  from the redshifted absorption lines they found .",
    "the latter must be an overestimate because it assumed a spherically symmetric inflow without knowing the outflow .",
    "it is therefore possible that the net outflow rate is close to zero or even positive .",
    "the outflow from the deeply embedded nucleus may be driven at least at its root by the radiation pressure on dust from the luminous nucleus @xcite .",
    "the criterion for a radiation - driven outflow is given with the luminosity - to - mass ratio as @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the mass opacity coefficient , @xmath22 speed of light , and @xmath202 the gravitational constant .",
    "for fully ionized hydrogen plasma , @xmath201 is the ratio of the thomson cross section to the masses of proton and electron and is @xmath203 .",
    "the minimum @xmath3 for the outflow is thus the eddington limit , @xmath204 . for 3  mass opacity coefficient of 50  @xcite , where the opacity is due to dust",
    ", the minimum @xmath3 for the outflow is 300 . for 50  where the sed of ngc 4418 peaks",
    ", the mass opacity coefficient is @xmath205  @xcite and the minimum @xmath3 for the outflow is 5000 . from these",
    ", a radiation - driven outflow appears possible from the region where the peak of the sed is in near - ir ; the peak shifts to longer wavelength further from the central source . unlike the inner region where the radiation pressure may drive the outflow , the outer region of the outflow along the rotation axis of the galaxy",
    "may be driven by thermal pressure since the polar direction is the direction of the steepest pressure gradient .    with the inflow / outflow rates of several  the ongoing evolution of the circumnuclear gas concentration is rapid in the sense that most of the @xmath111  molecular gas in the central 20 pc will be replaced in 10 myr .",
    "although the presumed accreting disk @xmath24 outflow structure may stay longer with a continuous supply of gas from the larger gas reservoir outside the 20 pc core , the degree of nuclear obscuration may significantly vary in the gas - flow time scale .",
    "the currently high @xmath3 can also change by an order of magnitude in 10 my for the starburst case and by a larger factor in much shorter time in the agn case .",
    "these considerations suggest a rapid evolution and a short duration of the current state of the ngc 4418 nucleus .",
    "finally , ngc 4418 and the two galaxies mentioned in  [ s.gas_concentration_mechanism ] for their nuclear gas concentrations",
    "share an outflow of molecular gas and/or dust from each nucleus .",
    "the nuclear outflow from ngc 1377 is seen in co kinematics @xcite and , as in ngc 4418 , as a red cone on a semi - minor axis in an optical color - index image @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the outflow of ngc 1266 from observations of co , , and ionized gas and suggested it to be agn - driven .",
    "there may be a common evolutionary relation between the compact nuclear gas concentrations and the outflows in these galaxies because a gas concentration is generally expected to feed nuclear activities that can drive an outflow .",
    "we made high - resolution 860 and 450  observations of ngc 4418 , a luminous infrared galaxy having a deeply embedded nucleus .",
    "continuum and lines including co(32 ) , hcn(43 ) , ( 43 ) , and cs(76 ) in the 350 ghz band were imaged at resolutions from 03 to 1(=165 pc ) in the central 34   ( 5.6 kpc ) .",
    "continuum at 660 ghz ( 450 ) was imaged at 02 resolution .",
    "we also examined sdss optical images for circumnuclear features related to the luminous nucleus .",
    "our key results are the following :    \\1 .",
    "the interstellar medium traced by the submillimeter emission is found strongly concentrated toward the nucleus .",
    "co(32 ) emission is detected only in the central 1 kpc ( 6 ) of the galaxy with almost all the single - dish flux .",
    "more than half of the co flux in the central kpc is in the central 165 pc ( 1 ) .",
    "higher excitation lines other than co are more concentrated toward the nucleus ( fwhm   50 pc = 03 ) , and the 860  continuum emission is even more compact .    \\2 .",
    "the peak brightness temperature of co(32 ) in the nuclear gas concentration is as high as 90 k at 03 ( 50 pc ) resolution , indicating the presence of hot molecular gas in the nucleus .",
    "other indications of hot or highly excited molecular gas are lines from vibrationally excited hcn and  with upper energy levels at 6601070 k above the ground .",
    "the 860  continuum emission at the nucleus has a size of 01 ( 17 pc ) in fwhm and deconvolved peak brightness temperature ( ) of about 210 k for a gaussian model .",
    "the diameter is 27 pc and 120 k for a uniform disk ( sphere ) model .",
    "the 860  opacity of this core is on the order of 1 and therefore the core is compton thick ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of this dusty core is estimated from these parameters to be @xmath206 .",
    "most of the galaxy luminosity ( @xmath75 ) is from this core .",
    "its luminosity surface density is @xmath207 .",
    "continuum emission at 450  also peaks at the nucleus but its flux density in our 30 pc ( @xmath10602 ) resolution data is less than half of the total flux density from single - dish observations .",
    "a more extended region than the 01 core , presumably the region detected in co(32 ) , must have significant 450  emission .",
    "extinction of the core by this colder envelope is a likely additional reason for the small core contribution at 450 .",
    "\\5 . the dynamical mass within the central 30 pc is estimated to be @xmath208 from the molecular gas velocities in the central 05 .",
    "the nucleus thus has @xmath209 .",
    "also , higher excitation lines are found broader than lower excited ones in the nucleus .",
    "this is likely due to faster gas motion and higher gas excitation parameters ( e.g. , density and temperature ) toward the center .",

    "a dominant agn would have a high eddington ratio 0.3 for the black hole expected from the bulge luminosity .",
    "for star formation to achieve the observed @xmath3 and @xmath153 , there must be a compact concentration of @xmath212 myr old stars well within the central 20 pc with a total mass on the order of @xmath111 .",

    "<S> we have observed the nucleus of the nearby luminous infrared galaxy ngc 4418 with subarcsec resolution at 860 and 450  for the first time to characterize its hidden power source . a 20 pc ( 01 ) </S>",
    "<S> hot dusty core was found inside a 100 pc scale concentration of molecular gas at the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> the 860  continuum core has a deconvolved ( peak ) brightness temperature of 120210 k. the co(32 ) peak brightness temperature there is as high as 90 k at 50 pc resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the core has a bolometric luminosity of about @xmath0 , which accounts for most of the galaxy luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> it is compton thick ( @xmath1 ) and has a high luminosity - to - mass ratio 500   as well as a high luminosity surface density @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters are consistent with an agn to be the main luminosity source ( with an eddington ratio about 0.3 ) while they can be also due to a young starburst near its maximum @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also found an optical color ( reddening ) feature that we attribute to an outflow cone emanating from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the hidden hot nucleus thus shows evidence of both an inflow , previously seen with absorption lines , and the new outflow reported here in a different direction . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus must be rapidly evolving with these gas flows . </S>"
