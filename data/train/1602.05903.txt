    "the generation , evolution , and role of magnetic fields in low - mass galaxies are still poorly understood .",
    "massive late - type spiral galaxies are supposed to have suitable conditions to generate large - scale magnetic fields via the large - scale @xmath7@xmath8 dynamo ( beck et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the interstellar medium ( ism ) in these galaxies has sufficiently strong shearing motions , caused by a combination of differential rotation and the coriolis force acting on turbulent gas motions .",
    "low - mass , dwarf irregular galaxies have much more chaotic gas motions and slow rotation speeds with little rotational shear , which might be unsuitable for the generation of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the majority of massive spiral galaxies has spiral magnetic fields related to spiral density waves ( beck & wielebinski @xcite ) . in dwarf galaxies , without any coherent density wave structures , the magnetic field topology could potentially be very different and regulated by other processes .    in dwarfs with high star formation rates ( sfrs ) , magnetic fields could be strongly modified by stellar winds , which constitute the dominant feedback in galaxy formation and evolution ( veilleux et al .",
    "because low - mass objects have shallow gravitational potentials , they are easily subjected to large - scale ( galactic ) winds ( recchi & hensler @xcite ) .",
    "they are therefore suspected to potentially spread out magnetic fields and cosmic rays ( crs ) far away from star - forming disks that may even pervade the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "thus , they are among the best candidates for the cosmic magnetizers in the early universe , where primordial galaxies may resemble some nearby starbursting low - mass galaxies ( kronberg et  al .",
    "@xcite ; dubois & teyssier @xcite ) .",
    "still , we lack observational evidence that stellar feedback in starbursting dwarfs can indeed produce powerful galactic winds that are able to shape the global magnetic field structure .",
    "one of the most nearby dwarf irregular galaxies , the local group member ic10 , is a very favorable target to test our current knowledge of the generation and evolution of magnetic fields in low - mass objects .",
    "the galaxy has a small linear size of about @xmath9kpc in diameter from ned and the distance of 830kpc from sanna et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] and a low mass , for instance , the mass of neutral hydrogen of @xmath10 is more than four times lower than that of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; grebel et al .",
    "ic10 is remarkable for its high sfr and large number of regions ( hodge & lee 1990 ) .",
    "normalized to its h@xmath11 surface density , ic10 has a much higher rate of star formation than most observed spiral or dwarf galaxies ( mateo @xcite ; leroy et al .",
    "ic10 has also a large population of wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars and the highest surface density of w - r stars among all local group galaxies ( massey & armandroff @xcite ) .",
    "a high number of carbon - type w - r stars indicates that the galaxy experienced a brief , but intense , galaxy - wide burst of star formation within the last 10myr .",
    "the observed stellar population holds clues that the galaxy experienced another starburst in the past , @xmath12150500 myr ago ( vacca et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this galaxy shows a complex morphology and peculiar velocity field ( ashley at al .",
    "@xcite ) . while the optical disk is aligned at a position angle of @xmath13 and at an inclination angle of @xmath14 (",
    "according to the hyperleda database ) , the disk has a different orientation : @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( wilcots & miller @xcite ) .",
    "it shows that the ism in ic10 is highly disturbed and the galactic disk is only poorly defined .",
    "it is possible that ic10 has merged with another dwarf galaxy and is accreting intergalactic gas filaments , which are visible in data cubes at various radial velocities .",
    "both processes could have fed ic10 s disk and thereby triggered its current starburst .",
    "ic10 has also been investigated in the radio domain . in a polarization study by chyy",
    "et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , using high - frequency ( @xmath17ghz ) , low - resolution ( 73@xmath18 ) single - dish observations , a single polarized region in the southern part of the galaxy was found , close to the position where yang & skillman ( @xcite ) found a large nonthermal superbubble .",
    "the rest of the disk of ic10 was devoid of polarized signal .",
    "the studies of ic10 were recently followed up by the high - resolution c - band jvla observations of heesen et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which confirmed strong polarized emission in the region of the nonthermal superbubble .",
    "it was suggested that the ordered magnetic field can be enhanced by the gas compression of the expanding bubble .",
    "the superbubble can be powered by about 10 supernova explosions ( yang & skillman @xcite ) or one hypernova event ( lozinskaya & moiseev @xcite ) .",
    "it is only a few myr old and has yet to sweep up a shell of atomic hydrogen ( heesen et al .",
    "no other coherent polarized structures were found in ic10 so far .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the structure , origin , and evolution of the magnetic field in ic10 utilizing sensitive multiband polarimetric observations obtained with the vla and the 100-m effelsberg telescope .",
    "radio interferometers can not detect emission at large angular scales , resulting in the so - called `` missing spacings flux , '' which can be corrected for with single - dish observations .",
    "for instance , heesen et al .  ( @xcite ) found that in their jvla observations of ic10 at 6ghz the flux density was @xmath1230% lower compared with the single - dish data presented by chyy et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) . the study presented here",
    "is based on a combination of vla and effelsberg data at @xmath5 and @xmath19ghz , which allows us to study the largest angular scales found in weak , diffuse radio emission .",
    "together with the vla observations at @xmath0ghz , we are able to trace the synchrotron emission and magnetic fields not only in the galaxy s disk but also in its halo .    in sect .  2 we present our radio observations of ic10 and data reduction procedures",
    "we present our results and their analysis in sect .",
    "[ s : results ] , followed by a discussion of the magnetic field structure and galactic wind ( sect .",
    "[ s : discussion ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ s : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "ic10 was observed with the effelsberg 100-m telescope at @xmath20 and @xmath21ghz . at @xmath20ghz",
    "we used the dual - horn system ( at an angular horn separation of 8) and a correlation polarimeter in the backend .",
    "corrections to the telescope pointing model were made about every @xmath22hr by scanning a nearby strong unresolved radio source .",
    "the individual coverages were obtained in both azimuth and elevation directions . in order to establish a flux density scale , we observed the calibration source 3c286 and assumed its total flux as @xmath23jy , according to the flux scale established from vla observations by perley & butler @xcite ) .",
    "the data were reduced in the nod2 package ( haslam @xcite ) , which allowed us to combine the coverages using software beam - switching ( emerson et al .",
    "@xcite ) and spatial - frequency weighting methods ( emerson & grve  @xcite ) .",
    "the maps were then digitally filtered to remove the spatial frequencies corresponding to noisy structures smaller than the telescope beam of @xmath24 .",
    "the procedure of data reduction included masking of spurious emission of individual coverages and combining them into the final maps in stokes parameters i , q and u. details of observations and the obtained rms noise levels are given in table [ t : ic10eff ] .    at @xmath21ghz",
    "the single - horn receiver in the secondary focus was used .",
    "high sensitivity of the observations was obtained by using a frequency bandwidth of @xmath25ghz .",
    "the galaxy was mapped employing scans along r.a .  and",
    "dec orientations .",
    "the calibrator 3c286 was once again applied for the flux scale calibration , assuming @xmath26jy total flux according to the vla flux scale .",
    "we then combined individual coverages through a procedure similar as for @xmath20ghz , obtaining the final maps in stokes i , q and u with a resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "the final maps from both frequencies were converted to fits format and taken into the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "maps of the total - power radio continuum intensity ( tp ) , linearly polarized intensity ( pi ) , degree of polarization , and e - vector orientation angles were thus obtained , and rms noise levels were determined ( table [ t : ic10eff ] ) .",
    "the pi was corrected for the positive bias resulting from the ricean distribution of noise . if not stated otherwise in the text , we present the magnetic field orientation , projected on the sky plane , as apparent b - vectors , which are defined as the e - vectors rotated by @xmath28 , not corrected for faraday rotation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t : i10hsyn ]    the morphology of both the total power and pi , presented in section [ s : results ] , suggests that the magnetic field in ic10 is probably , at least partially , shaped by a global galactic wind .",
    "the galactic halo that is well visible at @xmath0ghz map is not seen in any other ism component .",
    "however , the expected hot gas in the halo ( of @xmath29k ) may exist but is not detected in soft x - rays owing to possible large absorption in the milky way ( see sect .",
    "[ s : thermal ] ) .",
    "therefore , the radio emission and magnetic field structure remain the main evidence for a galactic wind in ic10 .",
    "the detection of magnetic fields far from star - forming regions indicates that also a population of crs is delivered to distant regions in the halo of ic10 .",
    "crs can even drive thermal gas outflows with coupling facilitated by streaming instability ( e.g.  dorfi & breitschwerdt @xcite ) .    using the radio data , we will now attempt to estimate the bulk speed of the cr electrons , which are assumed to be transported convectively from the disk into the halo .",
    "we use the approach pioneered by heesen et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , in which the bulk speed @xmath30 of the wind can be approximated as the ratio of cr electrons scale length @xmath31 to the cr electron lifetime .",
    "the value of @xmath31 can be derived from the synchrotron scale length ( @xmath32 ) in case of energy equipartition according to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the nonthermal spectral index .",
    "for ic10 we have @xmath35 ( chyy et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the scale length @xmath32 is determined by fitting an exponential model to radial profiles , for which we integrated the radio emission in the sky plane in radial rings . because in ic10 the distributions of h@xmath7 and are very irregular and galactic disk orientation unclear ( sect .",
    "[ s : bfieldstructure ] ) , we performed the fitting in three cases .",
    "first , we integrated emission over all azimuthal angles in rings centered on the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "second , we included emission only from a sector with an opening angle of @xmath36 and a major - axis orientation at @xmath37 .",
    "this sector is free of star - forming regions far from the disk , contrary to , e.g. , the opposite ( southeastern ) direction , which shows the chain of regions ( sect .",
    "[ s : results ] ) . in the third approach we made a similar fit but with the tip of the sector shifted to the center of the northern giant complex .",
    "this case seems to be the most reasonable one to measure the advection of plasma as the complex is probably the place of sources of cr acceleration and the magnetic field amplification process .",
    "the profiles of radio emission at @xmath0 and @xmath5ghz and results of model fitting are given in fig .",
    "[ f : i10slices21 ] and table [ t : i10hsyn ] .",
    "the obtained scale lengths for ic10 of about @xmath38kpc at @xmath0ghz are significantly smaller than for massive spirals , e.g.  ngc253 , for which the scale is about @xmath39kpc at the same frequency ( heesen et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the estimation of the bulk speed of cr electrons",
    "we assume predominance of the synchrotron losses ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "as stated earlier , inverse compton scattering is neglected in our analysis , so that the actual electron lifetimes may be shorter .",
    "we also neglect adiabatic losses , which could further shorten the electron lifetimes and enlarge the derived velocity of the convective transport .",
    "the value of @xmath41 can be calculated from the formula @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the strength of the total magnetic field ( see sec .",
    "[ ss : ic10bfieldstrength ] ) and @xmath44 is the energy of the relativistic electrons derived at the frequency of observations @xmath45 : @xmath46 taking the scale lengths determined for various cases and using the above formula , we computed the bulk speed of cr electrons @xmath30 ( table [ t : i10hsyn ] ) .",
    "the obtained values range from 25 to 66kms@xmath6 .",
    "we approximate the escape velocity @xmath47 from the disk of ic10 by the maximum velocity of galactic rotation : @xmath48 .",
    "taking @xmath49 of 30kms@xmath6 ( wilcots & miller @xcite ) , one gets @xmath47 of 40kms@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the estimated cr bulk speed in the vivid star - forming complex of @xmath50kms@xmath6 ( a mean between @xmath0 and @xmath5ghz values ) is considerably higher than the escape velocity .",
    "the average values of @xmath30 calculated for the whole galaxy or for northeast direction are slightly smaller ( 2535kms@xmath6 ) than the escape velocity .",
    "these two cases assume weaker magnetic fields , which leads to less energetic outflows of plasma from the galaxy disk . however , even in these cases it is conceivable that the cr bulk speed exceeds the escape velocity , because of our conservative estimate of the cr energy losses .",
    "this corroborates our earlier suggestion that a magnetized galactic - scale wind exists in ic10 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn from a rough estimate of the wind speed from the radial slope of the spectral index profile ( see heesen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the northeastern direction from the northern complex",
    "the gradient of the spectral index between @xmath0 and @xmath5ghz is about @xmath51kpc@xmath6 . for a magnetic field strength of @xmath52 g",
    "we first derive the time derivative of the radio spectral index @xmath53 and then obtain the bulk speed @xmath54kms@xmath6 .",
    "this value agrees with the wind velocity obtained from the radio profiles .    in our approach",
    "we assumed that plasma is transported convectively from the disk into the halo .",
    "we can now justify this assumption observing that the vertical profiles of the 1.43ghz radio continuum emission shown in fig.[f : i10slices21 ] can be closely approximated by exponential functions , as expected for convection , whereas diffusion would lead to profiles resembling a gaussian function ( heesen et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this means that diffusion plays only a minor role , providing us with an upper limit of the diffusion coefficient as @xmath55 ( assuming @xmath56 and conditions given in table [ t : i10hsyn ] for 1.43ghz ) .",
    "this value is approximately a factor of 10 smaller than the milky way value ( strong et al .",
    "@xcite ) , probably caused by the very turbulent magnetic field structure ( sect .",
    "[ ss : ic10bfieldstrength ] ) .",
    "our estimate of the galactic outflow speed in ic10 is in agreement with the outflow speeds in dwarf galaxies measured from the d absorption line ( below 100kms@xmath6 ) , at least for those objects that have similar circular velocities and sfrs ( veilleux et al .",
    "thus , the observed extensive magnetic fields in the halo of ic10 are probably not produced `` in situ '' by a dynamo process , but are likely ejected from complexes and dragged along with the galactic wind .",
    "galactic outflows are also considered as one of the mechanisms to form large - scale x - shaped magnetic fields observed in edge - on spiral galaxies ( sect .",
    "[ s : bfieldstructure ] ) . with a velocity of about 60kms@xmath6 the crs and magnetic fields in ic10 ,",
    "if advected with winds , can reach the most distant observable regions in the radio halo within @xmath57yr .",
    "this corresponds well to the timescale of the currently ongoing starburst ( sect .",
    "[ s : intro ] ) .",
    "the vertical extent of the radial ( x - type ) structure in ic10 , when compared with the optical disk size , is , relatively speaking , even larger than in edge - on spiral galaxies , such as ngc4631 or ngc5775 . in typical late - type spiral galaxies ,",
    "the radio halo extends vertically only above star - forming regions , i.e. galaxies have `` sharp edges '' ( dahlem et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in ic10 , however , the magnetic structure fills the entire , almost spherical radio halo ( fig .  [",
    "f : i10_6_pi45 ] ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of cr - driven winds by uhlig et al .",
    "( @xcite ) indeed predict that dwarf galaxies can experience spherically symmetric outflows . to fully compare such models with ic10 ,",
    "the explicit treatment of magnetic fields is necessary .",
    "there is yet another impact of the proposed large - scale magnetized wind in ic10 : galactic winds are considered as a potential process that enable galaxies to magnetize the igm .",
    "dwarf galaxies , which have shallow gravitational potentials and burst - like star formation histories , could spread magnetic fields into areas very remote from the regions of magnetic field and cr generation ( kronberg et  al .",
    "@xcite ; dubois & teyssier @xcite ; chyy et  al .",
    "the radial topology of the ordered magnetic field in the halo of ic10 , which currently undergoes a starburst ( see fig .  [",
    "f : i10_bfielddirections ] ) , enables efficient transport of the magnetized plasma along the open field lines and nicely conforms with this picture .",
    "we trace the magnetic field in the halo of ic10 out to a distance of about @xmath58kpc from the galaxy s center at @xmath0ghz .",
    "if the magnetized halo freely expands to a stall radius of about 5kpc ( see analytic modeling of chyy et  al.@xcite ) , we expect still strong fields there of @xmath12@xmath59 g . such extensive fields could be detected by probing very low energy crs with low - frequency observations ( with wsrt , gmrt , or lofar ) , or by the method of rm grids toward background polarized sources .",
    "such observations would allow us to justify the role of starburst dwarf galaxies , such as ic10 , in the magnetization of the igm .",
    "local starbursting dwarf galaxies constitute the ideal laboratory for such studies , since they are , in the paradigm of the @xmath60cdm hierarchical structure formation , the closest analogs of the first galaxies in the universe .",
    "we present a multifrequency radio continuum polarimetry study ( @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath19ghz ) of ic10 , the nearest dwarf irregular galaxy in an ongoing starburst phase .",
    "we use a combination of interferometric observations with the vla and single - dish observations with the 100-m effelsberg telescope .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "sensitive vla observations at @xmath0ghz reveal a large radio envelope of ic10 in total intensity , extending up to @xmath58kpc away from the galaxy s center , thus almost two times further than the infrared - emitting galactic disk .",
    "the envelope is not seen at higher frequencies ( @xmath5 and @xmath19ghz ) , suggesting substantial aging of cr electrons , actually confirmed by a gradual steepening of the nonthermal spectral index with distance from the galactic disk .",
    "2 .   compared to the total radio emission , the polarized emission of ic10 at @xmath5 and @xmath19ghz is more clumpy , with the most pronounced polarized extension located in the southern part of the galaxy , partially corresponding to the nonthermal superbubble . at @xmath0ghz ,",
    "the polarized signal covers also a large fraction of the observed area around the galaxy , which we explain as the milky way s foreground signal , unrelated to ic10 .",
    "such a strong foreground polarized emission has not been found in any other external galaxy before .",
    "3 .   on the largest scales , the apparent b - vectors of the pi exhibit a",
    "global `` x - shaped '' morphology of magnetic fields , with a dominating radial component .",
    "the structure resembles the one observed in several nearby edge - on spiral galaxies with higher sfrs .",
    "no such structures have been observed in dwarf galaxies to date .",
    "the x - shaped magnetic structure can be caused by galactic winds pulling out magnetic fields , driven by stellar winds from young , massive stars and supernova explosions .",
    "4 .   at the northern edge of the nonthermal superbubble",
    ", the magnetic field orientation changes abruptly and is aligned with a prominent dust lane that can be seen in optical images .",
    "this reveals some external processes shaping the magnetic field , as infalling gas and/or tidal interactions , resulting in compressed or stretched magnetic field lines .",
    "5 .   in spite of the small size and mass of ic10",
    ", the magnetic field strength has a mean of 14@xmath1 g , similar to those found in massive spiral galaxies .",
    "what sets the magnetic field structure apart is the dominating random component with a degree of field order of only @xmath61 , so that the ordered component has a mean strength of merely @xmath62 g .",
    "locally , the field is strongest in the southern and northern bright complexes , where it reaches @xmath2 g and is almost entirely random .",
    "farther away from the star - forming sites , the magnetic field becomes gradually more ordered , while at the same time the field strength drops .",
    "the nonthermal superbubble and the `` tangle region '' have field strengths of 22 and @xmath63 g , respectively . in the centers of holes ,",
    "the field strength is about 7@xmath4 g and of various degrees of field order ( @xmath64@xmath65 ) . even in the most distant galaxy outskirts ( about 1.4kpc from the center )",
    ", the magnetic field is still strong ( with strength of @xmath12@xmath66 g ) and partly ordered ( with a degree of @xmath67@xmath38 ) .",
    "we detect faraday rotation of about @xmath68radm@xmath69 in the giant complex , which corresponds to a weak regular magnetic field of @xmath70 g .",
    "we rule out a scenario for global operation of the mean - field dynamo process in ic10 , as the calculated large - scale dynamo number is subcritical and the e - folding time for amplification of the regular field is relatively long ( @xmath71@xmath72yr , according to mhd simulations ) .",
    "therefore , the strong total magnetic fields in ic10 probably arise from the small - scale dynamo .",
    "the radio emission profiles at @xmath0ghz indicate a scale length of the radio halo in ic10 of about @xmath38kpc , several times smaller than found in massive spiral galaxies at the same frequency . in combination with the cr electron lifetime , this implies a cr bulk speed from regions dominated by a giant complex of about 60kms@xmath6 , exceeding the escape velocity .",
    "thus , galaxy - wide magnetized winds can induce x - shaped magnetic fields and blow up the extensive radio halo visible in total intensity at @xmath0ghz .",
    "moreover , the magnetized plasma escaping from the gravitational well of this dwarf irregular galaxy is able to seed random and ordered magnetic fields in the igm , in a similar fashion that posited for the first low - mass galaxies in the early universe .",
    "the radio picture of ic10 is complex and manifests some magnetic patterns , which were found previously only in massive spiral galaxies .",
    "therefore , this dwarf irregular galaxy , one of our cosmic next - door neighbors that form the local group , is a valuable laboratory for our understanding of the generation and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies in general . because of ic10 s close proximity , it can serve as one of the benchmarks at which realistic numerical mhd simulations of the ism and galactic outflows can be tested against .",
    "ic10 holds valuable clues as to how low - mass galaxies acquire gas for triggering starbursts and how they amplify magnetic fields and eventually spread them out into the igm . having a clumpy disk and an intense star - forming activity , which provides significant feedback to the magnetized plasma",
    ", it allows us to gain precious insight in processes that regulate the formation of protogalaxies in the early universe .",

    "<S> we aim to explore whether strong magnetic fields can be effectively generated in low - mass dwarf galaxies and , if so , whether such fields can be affected by galactic outflows and spread out into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a radio continuum polarimetry study of ic10 , the nearest starbursting dwarf galaxy , using a combination of multifrequency interferometric ( vla ) and single - dish ( effelsberg ) observations . </S>",
    "<S> vla observations at @xmath0ghz reveal an extensive and almost spherical radio halo of ic10 in total intensity , extending twice more than the infrared - emitting galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> the halo is magnetized with a magnetic field strength of 7@xmath1 g in the outermost parts . </S>",
    "<S> locally , the magnetic field reaches about @xmath2 g in complexes , becomes more ordered , and weakens to @xmath3 g in the synchrotron superbubble and to 7@xmath4 g within holes . at the higher frequency of @xmath5ghz </S>",
    "<S> , we found a large - scale magnetic field structure of x - shaped morphology , similar to that observed in several edge - on spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the x - shaped magnetic structure can be caused by the galactic wind , advecting magnetic fields injected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds and supernova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> the radio continuum scale heights at 1.43ghz indicate the bulk speed of cosmic - ray electrons outflowing from complexes of about 60kms@xmath6 , exceeding the escape velocity of 40kms@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the magnetized galactic wind in ic10 inflates the extensive radio halo visible at 1.43ghz and can seed the igm with both random and ordered magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> these are signatures of intense material feedback onto the igm , expected to be prevalent in the protogalaxies of the early universe . </S>"
