    "light element observations are used to determine their primordial abundances @xcite .",
    "these in turn , are convolved with bbn theory to determine the baryon density .",
    "the uncertainties in the theory lie entirely with the nuclear reaction cross sections that govern the formation of the light nuclei @xcite .",

    "current cmb measurements by dasi and boomerang @xcite tentatively agree with this baryon density , as shown by the vertical band .    with the advent of precision measurements of the anisotropies in the cmb by map and planck ,",
    "we are obliged to go out of our way to improve both theory and observations in order to make the best comparison between bbn and the cmb .",
    "the reactions listed in table 1 dominate the uncertainties in the light element abundance predictions from bbn .",
    "the uncertainties listed are from @xcite , see also @xcite for different and complimentary methods .",
    "it is important to measure these key reactions to less than 4% so that bbn theory s predictions are more precise , making bbn a sharper probe of nuclear and particle astrophysics @xcite .    besides improving the nuclear reaction uncertainties",

    "a large number of 4 and 7 observations exist from extragalactic hii regions and the atmospheres of population ii stars in the galactic halo , respectively .",
    "both of these abundance determinations suffer from large systematic uncertainties .",
    "improvements in theoretical models of these regions are needed to reduce these systematics , and possible new obervational stageties should be attempted .",
