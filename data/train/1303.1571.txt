    "adaptive beamforming technology is of paramount importance in numerous signal processing applications such as radar , wireless communications , and sonar @xcite , @xcite . among various beamforming techniques , the beamformers based on the constrained minimum variance ( cmv ) criterion @xcite",
    "are prevalent and minimize the contribution of the total output power while maintaining the gain along the direction of the signal of interest ( soi ) .",
    "another alternative beamformer design is performed according to the constrained constant modulus ( ccm ) @xcite criterion , which is a positive measure of the beamformer output deviating from a constant modulus condition .",
    "compared with the cmv , the ccm beamformers exhibit superior performance in many severe scenarios ( e.g. , steering vector mismatch ) .",
    "many adaptive algorithms @xcite have been developed according to the cmv and ccm criteria for implementation .",
    "a simple and popular one is the stochastic gradient ( sg ) method @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the performance of the sg - based algorithms is sensitive to the step size , the number of interferers and sensor elements , and the eigenvalue spread @xcite . for improving the performance ,",
    "reduced - rank filtering has been introduced into beamforming in order to project the received signal onto a lower dimension subspace and perform the filter optimization within this subspace .",
    "this technique shows a fast convergence rate and improves tracking ability in situations where the number of sensor elements is large @xcite .",
    "the multi - stage wiener filter ( mswf ) @xcite and the auxiliary - vector filtering ( avf ) @xcite are two excellent approaches in this area . employing these reduced - rank schemes , the cmv beamformers reach improved performance but suffer from the heavy computational cost and instability .",
    "a joint iterative optimization scheme @xcite was presented recently with a simple adaptive implementation for reducing the complexity and improving the tracking ability .",
    "considering the fact that the ccm - based beamformers outperform the cmv ones for constant modulus constellations , we propose two adaptive reduced - rank algorithms according to the ccm criterion by employing a proposed reduced - rank scheme , which is based on the constrained joint iterative optimization filters .",
    "the proposed algorithms are implemented according to the constant modulus ( cm ) criterion with different constraints .",
    "the first one is formulated as a constrained joint iterative optimization of a projection matrix and a reduced - rank filter with respect to the cm criterion subject to a constraint on the array response .",
    "the projection matrix projects the received signal onto a lower dimension , which is then processed by the reduced - rank filter for the array output .",
    "the ccm expressions for the projection matrix and the reduced - rank filter are derived , and a simple efficient algorithm is presented to jointly estimate them for implementation . the second proposed algorithm is extended from the first one and implemented according to the cm criterion subject to a constraint on the array response and an orthogonal constraint on the projection matrix .",
    "we employ the gram schmidt ( gs ) technique @xcite to achieve this orthogonal constraint for the projection matrix reformulation .",
    "the performance of the second algorithm outperforms the first one .",
    "simulation results are given to demonstrate the superior performance and stability achieved by the proposed algorithms versus the existing algorithms in typical scenarios .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : we outline a system model for beamforming in section 2 .",
    "based on this model , the problem statement is presented .",
