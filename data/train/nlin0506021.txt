    "a nonlinear dynamical system can be completely deterministic and its solution unique , yet two trajectories that begin close to one another may diverge significantly in a finite time .",

    "probabilistic descriptions , by contrast , avoid the details of time - evolution , and instead answer meaningful statistical questions . as a canonical example , experimental measurements of turbulent velocity fluctuations show disordered and unpredictable behavior yet reproducible statistical properties .",

    "finally , from a theoretical perspective it can be more enlightening to work directly with direct statistical approaches @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply a method pioneered by hopf @xcite to determine the exact characteristic functional of a simple dynamical system introduced by orszag @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the characteristic functional yields all of the equal - time moments and offers some advantage over the more common statistical description in terms of the probability density function ( pdf ) .",

    "exact solutions are invaluable as they both yield physical insight and provide important benchmarks against which approximate methods can be tested .",

    "in addition , for @xmath9 , all periodic orbits and fixed points are unstable @xcite .",
    "the system appears to be ergodic for all initial conditions except a set of measure zero .",
    "this also seems to be the case for other odd values of @xmath10 .",
    "finally we note that the dynamical system formally obeys liouville s theorem , despite being non - hamiltonian : @xmath11    the assumption of ergodicity combined with the energy constraint eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) has an important consequence .",
    "strikingly , the system exhibits continuous rotational symmetry in its statistics , despite the fact that the eom are invariant only under discrete rotations corresponding to the permutation of indices .",

    "we must integrate over all of the coordinates .",
