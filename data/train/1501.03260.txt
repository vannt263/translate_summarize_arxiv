    "perturbation around black holes has been an intriguing subject of discussions in the past three decades .",
    "this is mainly because that the study of black hole perturbations is a powerful tool to disclose the stability of the black hole spacetime .",
    "if the black hole is unstable against small perturbations , it will inevitably disappear or transform dynamically into another object .",
    "stability analysis of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional asymptotically flat black holes , such as schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) and kerr black holes , has been studied thoroughly against different kinds of perturbations including neutral scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations and all these black holes were found stable . considering that our universe may have a small positive cosmological constant , the perturbation analysis has been extended to ( 3 + 1)-dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter ( ds ) , rn - ds , and kerr - ds black holes and evidences for the stability of these more possible astrophysical black holes have been reported .",
    "recently , motivated by the discovery of the correspondence between physics in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and conformal field theory ( cft ) on its boundary ( ads / cft ) , the perturbations around four - dimensional ads black holes have been examined and ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ads black holes were found stable under neutral scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations . it was concluded that all of the considered four - dimensional black holes tested for stability are stable , except the string theory generalization of kerr - newman black holes whose stabilities have not been tested due to the difficulty in decoupling the angular variables in their perturbation equations . for a review on this topic , see @xcite for example and references therein .",
    "recently , the exploration of the black hole spacetime stability has been extended to examine the perturbation against the charged scalar field . in the ads",
    "spacetime , it was first observed that the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional rn - ads black hole can be destroyed and the four - dimensional ads hole can become unstable due to the condensation of the charged scalar hair onto the black hole .",
    "the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional rn - ads black hole will finally be transformed into another new hairy black hole under the small charged scalar field perturbation @xcite , see review for example @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to ask whether the observed instability only happens for the ads black holes because of their special spacetime properties , whether such dynamical instability can also appear in other four - dimensional black hole backgrounds . in @xcite ,",
    "a new instability in the four - dimensional rn - ds black holes against charged scalar perturbations was disclosed .",
    "this result was later confirmed in @xcite .",
    "can this instability be a general property ?",
    "in this paper , we would like to examine this problem further .",
    "we will extend the discussion of the charged scalar perturbation to the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional dilaton black hole obtained by garfinkle , horowitz and strominger  @xcite(ghs ) from the low energy effective action in string theory .",
    "its limiting case reduces to the four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole , see review  @xcite .",
    "the stability of this dilaton black hole has been proved by examining the perturbation against neutral scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "here we are going to test the stability of such black hole against charged scalar perturbation and try to answer whether the instability observed for the charged scalar perturbation can also happen in this stringy four - dimensional black hole background and its limiting schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we will concentrate on the frequency domain studies of the charged scalar perturbation around the stringy black hole .",
    "it is important to calculate the frequency of perturbations with very high accuracy because considerable changing of black hole parameters frequently changes perturbation frequency just by a few percent . with the nonzero charge of the scalar field",
    ", we will explain that not all available numerical methods for solving the eigenvalue problem of the perturbation can keep high accuracy .",
    "the continued fraction method ( cfm ) @xcite and the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) @xcite still win the accuracy and efficiency competition against the other numerical methods .",
    "the cfm method was argued as the most accurate in calculating the frequency of the perturbation @xcite .",
    "although this still holds when the charge of the scalar field is low , we will show that its accuracy and efficiency will be decreased and lower than that of the aim method when the scalar field is heavily charged .",
    "further comparison of the accuracy and efficiency of numerical methods in calculating the frequency of the perturbation is important , because this can help to choose the right numerical tool in obtaining the real physics on the stability of the black hole .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "in sec.2 we will introduce the background spacetime of the stringy black hole and derive the equation of motion for charged scalar perturbations . in sec.3 , we will first review the cfm and aim methods for numerical computations of the frequency of the perturbation .",
    "then we will compare the efficiency and accuracy of these two methods and also with other methods . in the following section , we we will give numerical results on the frequency of the charged scalar perturbations .",
    "we will present our summaries and discussions in the final section .",

    "( [ eq : action - e ] ) ( the background solution means the solution not taking into account the back - reaction of the perturbing field @xmath8 ) .",

    "the electric field and the background dilaton field are @xmath24 it is obvious that the electric charge and the dilaton are not independent .",
    "the ghs solution reduces to the schwarzschild black hole in the limit @xmath25 .    in the limit @xmath25 , the area of the sphere @xmath26 is zero so that this surface is singular . when @xmath27 , this singular surface is surrounded by the event horizon @xmath28 .",
    "as one increases @xmath23 , the singular surface can coincide with the horizon when @xmath29 and even moves outside the horizon and becomes timelike if @xmath30 . in our paper",
    ", we will consider the case when @xmath27 .",
    "ignoring the self - interaction term , the equation of motion of the perturbing charged scalar field is @xmath31 here @xmath32 plays the role of the effective mass square of @xmath8 .",
    "since the background spacetime is spherical symmetry , we can separate the radial and angular part of @xmath8 . using the ansatz @xmath33 and introducing the tortoise coordinate @xmath34 , we get the radial part of the perturbation equation @xmath35\\psi = 0 \\label{eq : radial_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath36 and the effective potential @xmath37 . here",

    "a practical tool for testing stability of black holes is the numerical investigation of the perturbations around black hole backgrounds .",
    "usually considerable changing of black hole parameters results in the change of just a few percent in the frequency of the perturbation .",
    "thus the high accuracy of the computation is the key factor in examining the perturbation around black holes .",
    "meanwhile the efficiency of the computation is also an important factor in solving the perturbation equations numerically .    in this work",
    ", we will concentrate on the frequency domain to disclose the property of the perturbation",
    ". we will refine different numerical methods and try to solve the eigenvalue problem of the perturbation equation with high accuracy and efficiency . comparing with other numerical methods , we find that the cfm and aim methods can meet requirements of the high accuracy and efficiency in the computation .",
