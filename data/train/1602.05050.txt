    "on september 14 , 2015 the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) detected a transient gravitational wave ( gw ) signal of a binary black hole ( bh ) merger @xcite .",
    "analysis of this event , gw150914 , showed that an energy of @xmath4 went into gws and that the luminosity distance to the source was @xmath5  mpc , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "ligo provided us with direct evidence for the existence of binary bh systems and existence of their merger .",
    "this is the beginning of gw astronomy .",
    "it is also surprising that the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) detected a possible gamma - ray counterpart 0.4  sec after the detection of gw150914 @xcite , while electromagnetic counterparts from binary bh mergers had hardly been expected before this event .",
    "the gamma - ray emission lasted for about 1  sec .",
    "the observed fluence between 10 and 1000  kev was 2@xmath7erg  @xmath8 , so that the isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray energy @xmath9 is @xmath10  erg , which is only a small fraction ( @xmath11 ) of the energy radiated by gw .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity in the 1  kev10  mev band is measured as @xmath12  erg  s@xmath13 , which is again a very tiny fraction of the peak gw luminosity of @xmath14  s@xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "a possible peak energy in the spectrum is a few mev , and there is no evidence of photons above @xmath16  mev .",
    "the spectrum seems hard considering its small @xmath9 , which makes the event an outlier of the relation for short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "so far , no other electromagnetic , including neutrino , counterpart has been reported @xcite .",
    "this surprise already triggered theoretical works @xcite .",
    "note that the significance of the gbm emission is not high , and that the observed gbm fluence contradicts the integral upper limit @xcite .",
    "hence , at present , the gamma - ray emission associated with binary bh merger event has not been firmly established .    in this paper",
    ", we point out that if the gbm detection of gamma - rays coincident with gw150914 is real , then the gamma - ray emission arises from relativistically expanding material with a bulk lorentz factor larger than 10 ( section  2 ) .",
    "then , we consider the afterglow emission which is the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons accelerated at a shock propagating into the ambient matter ( section  3 ) .",
    "finally , in section  4 , we compare our model prediction with current upper limits in the x - ray , optical , and infrared bands . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the `` tt+lowp+lensing+ext '' cosmological parameters from table  4 of @xcite .",
    "the horizon scale of the final bh , whose mass and spin are @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite , is @xmath19  cm .",
    "the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit is @xmath20 for @xmath18 .",
    "if the energy source of the gamma - ray emission is the gravitational energy of accreting matter , the required mass is @xmath21 for @xmath22 erg .",
    "the required mass is so tiny compared to @xmath23 that it is not surprising even if a small part of the circum - binary disk supplies such a small mass @xmath24 onto the bh .",
    "another possible mechanism for the energy release is the dissipation of the magnetic energy @xmath25 , which implies @xmath26 g. alternatively , the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process may extract the rotation energy of the bh @xcite and produce poynting - flux - dominated jets .",
    "the required magnetic field is @xmath27 g @xcite for @xmath28 erg  @xmath29 .",
    "first , let us consider the fireball model @xcite , which has been applied to grbs .",
    "a huge energy release in the localized region around the bh leads to an optically thick radiation - dominated plasma , whose components are photons , electrons and positrons .",
    "if the fireball energy is continuously injected into a volume of @xmath30 , the energy density is estimated as @xmath31 . in this case , the initial temperature is @xmath32  kev , which is too low compared to the observed photon energy ( here the boltzmann constant is taken as unity ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if an energy @xmath9 is promptly released , the energy density @xmath33 corresponds to an initial temperature of @xmath34  mev .",
    "the fireball starts to expand and is accelerated by its own pressure ; the lorentz factor grows with the radius as @xmath35 and the temperature drops as @xmath36 ( the photon energy density @xmath37 ) @xcite .",
    "the photon temperature for the observer @xmath38 is constant , and consistent with the observed spectrum . the number density of the electron ",
    "positron pairs in the complete thermal equilibrium decreases with temperature as @xmath39 . in the baryon - free limit , the photosphere radius at which @xmath40 is calculated as @xmath41 for the initial temperature @xmath42  mev , which means @xmath43 at the photosphere .",
    "the luminosity of the photospheric emission is @xmath44 erg  s@xmath13 , which is much higher than the observed value as a natural consequence of adjusting the temperature rather than the luminosity .",
    "therefore , the baryon - free photospheric model can not reconcile the temperature with the luminosity .",
    "in addition , the emission timescale @xmath45  msec is too short in this case . even for the trapped fireball model @xcite , in which the fireball is trapped in the magnetosphere of the bh ,",
    "the contradiction between the temperature and luminosity remains unsolved .",
    "therefore , the observed gamma - ray emission is not due to photospheric emission from the baryon - free fireball .",
    "the fireball may be contaminated by baryons .",
    "in such a case , the fireball expansion evolves to a relativistic outflow of baryons , which may emit gamma - rays at the outer radius via internal shock etc . @xcite or relic thermal photons at the baryonic photosphere .",
    "if the observed emission is coming from the baryonic photosphere , much more energy is required as the bulk kinetic energy of the baryons .",
    "the maximum gamma - ray energy is a few mev in the observation",
    ". if the bulk lorentz factor is higher than 10 , the energies of those photons are below @xmath46 in the comoving frame of the outflow . then , electron - positron pair production in the source can be avoided , so that gamma - rays can safely escape from the source . for a baryonic fireball with the final lorentz factor @xmath47 and total luminosity @xmath48 ,",
    "the photosphere is @xmath49 . to set the emission radius @xmath50 ( the time delay @xmath51 s between gamma - ray and gw ) outside the photosphere",
    ", @xmath52 is required . on the other hand ,",
    "the baryon amount in the poynting - flux - dominated jet model is not constrained well , so that the minimum lorentz factor required to avoid @xmath53 absorption may be @xmath54 .",
    "even after the gamma - ray emission , a significant amount of the kinetic energy ( @xmath55 erg ) may remain as an outflow , which plunges into the ambient medium . similarly to the model for binary neutron star merger @xcite , we can expect afterglow emission from the forward shock formed by the outflow .",
    "the bulk of gamma - ray emitting materials pushes the ambient medium to form a shock , generating high - energy electrons which produce synchrotron radiation .",
    "we calculate such afterglows in the same procedure as for grbs @xcite .",
    "initially the ejecta mass @xmath56 is injected at the origin @xmath57 with expanding bulk lorentz factor @xmath58 .",
    "the burst energy is then @xmath59 , with which the material expands outwards .",
    "as will be shown later , given the energy @xmath60 , the parameter @xmath58 only affects the very early stage of the afterglow .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath58 does not disturb the prediction of the late afterglow .",
    "we assume spherical expansion  jet collimation is not considered ( see section  4 for a discussion ) .",
    "the ambient matter is uniform with density @xmath61 . following the previous work of @xcite ,",
    "the dynamics of the shock is numerically computed . in deriving the observed flux density of the synchrotron emission @xmath62 at frequency @xmath63",
    ", we integrate the emissivity over the equal arrival time surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming a thin shell emission approximation . using the standard convention in the grb community , the power - law index of the electron distribution @xmath64 , together with the microphysics parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 , determines the emissivity profile in the comoving frame . here",
    ", we adopt the form of the electron distribution @xmath67 as given in @xcite . in calculating the radio synchrotron emission ,",
    "we take into account the effect of synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) .",
    "the optical depth @xmath68 to ssa was given by , for example , eq .",
    "( 52 ) of @xcite .",
    "the self - absorption frequency @xmath69 , at which @xmath70 , is generally below the radio band , so that the emission is optically thin .",
    "we adopt @xmath71  erg , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74  @xmath2 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 as fiducial parameters .",
    "the red curves in figure  1 show the afterglow light curves in the 1.4  ghz radio band for the fiducial parameters .",
    "the flux initially increases and there is a small bump at @xmath78  sec after the gw event . in our case , the observed @xmath62 spectrum has a maximum at @xmath79 , where the minimum frequency @xmath80 is the characteristic frequency of the synchrotron emission by electrons with the minimum lorentz factor @xmath81 .",
    "the frequency @xmath82 decreases with time , and crosses the observation frequency of 1.4  ghz around the observer time of the bump in the light curve . in our case ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath80 are comparable at that time .",
    "the peak flux and the peak time are consistent with the result in morsony  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , which appeared in arxiv just after the submission of this paper . at @xmath83  sec",
    ", the shock reaches the radius at which @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the shock velocity divided by the velocity of light and @xmath86 .",
    "after that , the expansion velocity becomes newtonian .",
    "furthermore , we can see @xmath87 if @xmath88  sec , where @xmath89 is the electron lorentz factor whose typical photon frequency corresponds to the absorption frequency , and @xmath90 is the electron lorentz factor above which synchrotron cooling is significant .",
    "the radio flux monotonically decreases after the peak .",
    "the shock dynamics is roughly approximated by the sedov scaling law , @xmath91 . in this case , the flux is given by @xmath92 @xcite , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the magnetic field strength in the comoving frame and the swept - up mass of ambient matter at the shock radius @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "using the non - relativistic sedov scalings , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , one can see @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which is the same as predicted for the binary neutron star merger event @xcite .",
    "this scaling explains the decline .",
    "one can see the parameter dependence from figure  1 .",
    "a change of @xmath58 only affects the flux at very early epochs .",
    "as seen in the left panel of figure  1 , the flux decays more rapidly for larger values of @xmath64 .",
    "the number density of the ambient matter is highly uncertain , so that we take a wide range of @xmath61 in the right panel of figure  1 .",
    "the radio emission is brighter for larger @xmath61 .",
    "figure  2 shows optical r - band light curves , similarly to figure  1 .",
    "the peak of the optical afterglow is earlier than for radio .",
    "the peak epoch roughly corresponds to the onset time of deceleration of the outflow @xcite , which is estimated as @xmath101  sec for our fiducial parameters . after the peak ,",

    "the possible gamma - ray detection with fermi may help localize the gw signal , while the localization with only gw detectors is pretty wide to follow up with electromagnetic telescopes @xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of binary neutron star merger , binary bh merger events can be followed by radio telescopes with sensitivity @xmath106jy , such as the very large array ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as we have shown , the predicted radio flux of the afterglow at the time when the gw detection was published ( 150  days after the event ) is too dim to be detected as a transient radio object .",
    "however , the event gw150914 encourages us to try follow - up with radio telescopes in future gw detections , even if the signal shows evidence of binary bh merger .",
    "if the radio survey for the entire error region is possible , the observations will be able to constrain the number density of the ambient matter ( see the right panel of figure  1 ) . in the case of gw150914 ,",
    "if the radio afterglow is not detected at @xmath107@xmath108  sec after the gw event , the ambient density @xmath61 may be smaller than @xmath1  @xmath2 .",
    "optical / infrared upper limits have also been given @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the typical survey depth is @xmath10922  mag , corresponding to @xmath11030  @xmath111jy , which is well above the prediction of our afterglow model .",
    "hence the reported optical / infrared upper limits at @xmath112  sec do not constrain our model parameters . if the initial lorentz factor @xmath58 is very high , @xmath113 , then the optical / infrared afterglow in the very early epoch ( @xmath114  sec ) is brighter than @xmath115jy ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "2 ) , so that early - time ( @xmath114  sec ) upper limits would have given the upper bound of @xmath58 .",
    "note that for @xmath116  @xmath2 , the optical afterglow was detectable until @xmath117  sec with large telescopes such as the subaru hyper suprime - cam .",
    "we briefly comment on the x - ray flux of the afterglow .",
    "our model predicts that the x - ray flux peaks at @xmath118 and the peak flux is below @xmath119  erg  s@xmath13@xmath8 for fiducial parameters .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ performed slew survey observations 2 hours and 2 weeks after the gw event @xcite , and the _ swift _ xrt started follow - up observations about 2 days after the gw trigger @xcite .",
    "however , no x - ray counterpart was detected .",
    "the flux upper limit is @xmath120@xmath121  erg  s@xmath13@xmath8 .",
    "the model prediction is then well below this upper limit , so that our afterglow model is not constrained .    in this paper , we have considered spherically symmetric outflow .",
    "data analysis of gw showed that inclination angle , which is the angle between the total angular momentum and the line of sight , may be large , although the uncertainty is large @xcite .",
    "hence , it seems unnatural that a collimated outflow is launched in the direction near the line of sight . on the other hand",
    ", it may be expected that a collimated jet with high bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath113 ) is launched along the total angular momentum .",
    "such a jet causes a ( short ) grb , if it is seen on - axis along the direction of the total angular momentum .",
    "however , the gamma - ray emission detected with fermi may not be the off - axis emission from such a short grb . as long as the angle between the jet axis and our line of sight is large , the observed typical photon energy ( that is , the peak photon energy in the @xmath122 spectrum ) becomes smaller than that observed in the on - axis direction due to the relativistic doppler effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the typical photon energy for an on - axis observer should be much higher than the actually observed value ( @xmath123  mev ) , which is atypical for short grbs ( e.g. , * ?",
    "so the gamma - ray emission may be emitted quasi - isotropically in this event .",
    "for the case of off - axis ultrarelativistic jet emission , the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy of the jet for an on - axis observer may be much higher than @xmath124  erg as seen in the usual short grbs . if the collimation - corrected kinetic energy of the jet is larger than @xmath124  erg , late - time ( @xmath125  sec ) radio afterglow emission is brighter than our present result for isotropic outflow with @xmath71  erg .",
    "this is because all the emission energy can be seen as the jet is decelerated to a non - relativistic regime at which the relativistic beaming effect becomes negligible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , morsony  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the off - axis afterglow in the case of an isotropic - equivalent jet kinetic energy of @xmath126  erg , a jet opening half - angle of 10  degree ( corresponding to a collimation - corrected kinetic energy of the jet of @xmath127  erg ) , and a viewing angle of the jet of 30  degree , and they obtained the 1.4  ghz peak flux of 30  mjy for @xmath74  @xmath2 at time @xmath128  sec .",
    "hence , the presence of the relativistic jet may be tested by late - time radio observations .",
