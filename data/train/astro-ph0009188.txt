    "in the standard model for an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , radiant energy is released through accretion onto a supermassive ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) black hole . however , until recently , there have been few mass estimates for nuclear black holes in agn .",
    "kinematic studies of nuclear gas disks ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and stellar dynamical studies , using high spatial resolution ground - based spectroscopy ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recently with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have produced numerous central mass estimates mostly for normal galaxies .",
    "however , in application to agn these techniques are severely limited . since roughly one galaxy in a hundred",
    "has a luminous active nucleus even the nearest examples are relatively distant reducing the effective spatial resolution .",
    "furthermore , stellar dynamical techniques require high signal - to - noise measurements of stellar absorption features which are often lost in the glare of a bright active nucleus .",
    "also emission lines from ionized gas at small radii can be influenced by relativistic jets or winds associated with the agn .",
    "these difficulties can be overcome , however , using reverberation mapping techniques ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "monitoring the variability of the continuum and emission line fluxes in broad line agn , shows that the two are highly correlated but that the emission lines lag behind the continuum by times ranging from days to months .",
    "the lag is best explained as a light travel time effect and can be used to estimate the size of the broad line region ( blr ) . if one further assumes that the blr kinematics are largely keplerian , one can use the line widths as a characteristic velocity and in turn determine the total mass contained within the blr .",
    "strong evidence for keplerian motion exists for at least one well - studied seyfert , ngc 5548 .",
    "results for several different emission lines , each with different lags and therefore spanning a range of distances from the nucleus , give consistent values for the central mass @xcite .",
    "reverberation studies have now yielded @xmath0  estimates for numerous seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "however , there have been some claims that the masses determined from these variability studies are systematically low @xcite .",
    "recent work has focused on the distributions of black hole properties and the relationship to their host galaxies . @xcite first found a correlation between @xmath0  and the mass of the spheroidal component , @xmath5 . in a comprehensive study using ground - based spectroscopy and hst imaging , @xcite , presented strong evidence in support of the the @xmath0  ",
    "@xmath5  relation .",
    "more recently , two studies @xcite reported relationships between @xmath0and @xmath6 , the stellar velocity dispersion obtained within a large aperture extending to the galaxy effective radius , thus insensitive to the influence of the black hole .",
    "the correlation between these two parameters is remarkably strong suggesting a link between the formation of the bulge and the development of the black hole .    in this paper",
    "we combine reverberation mapping measurements of @xmath0 in agn with narrow line region ( nlr ) gas and bulge stellar kinematic measurements corresponding to motion well beyond influence of the black hole to compare the nuclei of active and normal galaxies .",
    "we also investigate the possibility of a correlation between black hole mass and the radio luminosity in agn .",
    "section 2 describes the data collected from the literature .",
    "section 3 presents the @xmath0 @xmath1  relation for agn . in section 4",
    "we consider the relationship between @xmath0  and the radio luminosity and in section 5 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we start with all agn with black hole masses , measured by the reverberation mapping technique : 17 seyfert 1 galaxies ( as compiled by * ? ? ? * ) and 17 pg quasars @xcite . for most of the galaxies ,",
    "we use the black hole masses tabulated by @xcite evaluated using the mean h@xmath7 profile width .",
    "values for three galaxies ( mkn 279 , ngc 3516 , and ngc 4593 ) were taken from @xcite .",
    "for as many objects as possible we obtained published measurements of @xmath1 , @xmath8}$ ] , and the radio flux .",
    "the adopted values are presented in table [ tab : agnstuff ] . for the seyferts , @xmath8}$ ]",
    "is taken from @xcite .",
    "for the quasars @xmath8}$ ]  values were only adopted if the spectroscopy was of medium to high resolution ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xmath1  in agn host galaxies has been determined using spectral regions around both the ca  ii triplet  and mg@xmath10 .",
    "the values used here have been published in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for references on individual galaxies ) .",
    "radio luminosities are from @xcite for seyferts and from @xcite for pg quasars .",
    "we have scaled observations at 5ghz assuming a power - law index of 0.7 and assume @xmath11 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath12 , the ratio of the radio to optical flux , using the mean continuum luminosities from @xcite .",
    "we point out that the stellar and gas kinematic measurements are from small aperture observations typically covering @xmath13@xmath14 , somewhat smaller than the apertures used to measure @xmath6",
    ". nevertheless , we can be confident that these measurements are unaffected by the presence of the black hole .",
    "first , since the agn are at larger distances than the normal galaxies for which @xmath0  has been determined , the aperture typically corresponds to physical scales of a kpc or more , actually comparable to the bulge effective radius .",
    "second @xcite found that seyferts were offset from the faber - jackson relation ( @xmath15 ) for normal galaxies in the sense of having lower velocity dispersions than normal galaxies of the same @xmath5 .",
    "their interpretation was that seyfert bulges have lower @xmath16 ratios than normal spirals , exactly the opposite of what one would expect if the stellar kinematics were strongly influenced by a massive nuclear black hole .",
    "recently , @xcite included seyferts in their plot of @xmath1vs .",
    "@xmath0  ( in some cases choosing different values for @xmath1  than in table [ tab : agnstuff ] ) and conclude that agn show no significant difference from the overall relation . unfortunately , @xmath1  values are available in the literature for only a hand - full of the agn with reverberation mapping estimates for @xmath0 .",
    "therefore a definitive comparison of agn and normal galaxies is not possible with these data .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that for the majority of seyfert galaxies , a moderately strong correlation between @xmath8}$ ]  and @xmath1  exists indicating roughly equal absorption and emission line widths .",
    "thus the [ oiii ] @xmath25007  profiles are dominated by virial motion in the bulge potential . as might be expected , a fair amount of real ( _ i.e. _ not due to measurement error ) scatter does exist .",
    "@xcite used the deviation from purely virial gas motion to investigate possible secondary influences on the nlr kinematics .",
    "their results confirmed conclusions from previous studies ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the interaction of nlr gas with a relatively strong kiloparsec - scale linear radio source can produce non - virial gas acceleration .",
    "they also found a weak tendency for interacting systems and mergers to have broader emission lines than expected from purely virial motion , an issue that may be important in quasars which are more likely to be interacting systems @xcite .",
    "thus , keeping the issue of secondary influences on the nlr kinematics in mind , we can proceed with the idea that the primary influence on the forbidden line widths in agn is the bulge potential .",
    "[ tab : agnstuff ]    in figure [ fig : bhsig ] we plot @xmath8}$ ] /2.35  or @xmath1  vs. @xmath0 .",
    "filled symbols show the @xmath8}$ ] values  for the galaxies in table [ tab : agnstuff ] , @xmath17 for seyferts ,    ' '' ''    for the pg quasars , @xmath18 signs show agn for which @xmath1  measurements exist and triangles show @xmath0  and @xmath6  from @xcite . the similarity in the trends between the data from table 1 and the @xcite sample is striking .",
    "the long solid line is the relation determined by @xcite and the shorter dashed line is our fit to the agn , using the ordinary least - squares bisector @xcite which gives good results for large uncertainties in both variables .",
    "the correlation for the agn is moderately strong ( @xmath19 , @xmath20% ) with a slope @xmath21 and intercept @xmath22 .",
    "the agn relation is slightly shifted to larger widths for a given @xmath0  than the @xcite relation and is more scattered .",
    "also , there seems to be no statistical difference between the distributions of seyferts and quasars .",
    "the slope on the fit agrees well with that found by @xcite who derived a different value than @xcite ( 3.75 as opposed to 4.8 ) . @xcite",
    "discuss various explanations for the difference in the two values .",
    "although our result supports a shallower slope , an analysis using stellar velocity dispersion instead of emission line width would be more conclusive .",
    "we can be more quantitative about the similarity of the relation for elliptical galaxies and that for the agn , by considering the origin of the scatter .",
    "the mean @xmath23 error bar in log @xmath0 , plotted in the upper left , is @xmath24 while the r.m.s .",
    "deviation of the filled symbols in figure [ fig : bhsig ] , relative to the @xcite relation is 0.55 .",
    "since we expect that emission line widths can be determined to accuracies of @xmath25 10% for the spectral resolution of the observations , we expect that a large component of the scatter is not due to measurement error but reflects real deviations perhaps indicating secondary influences on nlr kinematics .",
    "if we calculate the difference from the @xcite relation , this time in log fwhm@xmath26}$ ] , we find a small offset , @xmath27 } = 0.06 $ ] , with a distribution of r.m.s .",
    "width 0.14 .",
    "@xcite used differences in emission and absorption line widths , @xmath28 } - log 2.35 \\sigma_*$ ] , to investigate non - virial influences on emission line kinematics . for their entire seyfert sample",
    "they found @xmath29 and an r.m.s .",
    "width of 0.2 . excluding interacting galaxies and objects with relatively luminous linear radio sources they found @xmath30 , thus slightly narrower emission lines than absorption lines , and an r.m.s .",
    "width of 0.13 .",
    "thus it is reasonable that the scatter and the small offset indicate non - virial contributions to the line widths in some objects .",
    "the fact that the r.m.s .",
    "deviation is comparable to that found in @xcite is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "unfortunately , the current sample includes no seyferts with strong linear radio sources and , due to their larger distances , the radio maps for the quasars are mostly unresolved on kpc scales ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , no strong statements regarding non - virial gas kinematics can be made .",
    "the relationship between @xmath0  and the @xmath8}$ ]  in agn is precisely what we would expect if agn follow the @xmath0  ",
    "@xmath1  relation and if the primary influence on nlr kinematics is the bulge gravitational potential .",
    "although one might point out that the agn plotted with @xmath1  do seem to lie systematically below the relation , the reality of such a shift based on only 7 objects is not compelling .",
    "our primary conclusion is that the relationship between the mass of the central dark object and the depth of the gravitational potential in agn is the same as for normal galaxies .",
    "clearly more velocity dispersion measurements for agn are needed .",
    "however , in fainter objects detailed studies of the [ oiii ] emission line profiles accounting for non - virial kinematic components could provide a valuable substitute .",
    "these results seem to conflict with previous reports that agn have lower black hole to bulge mass ratios than normal galaxies @xcite or alternatively that the reverberation mapping estimates of @xmath0  are systematically low @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : bhsig ] suggests that neither of these is correct and that the differences must lie in the values of @xmath5 .",
    "a number of factors may have contributed to this apparent disagreement .",
    "first , the @xmath0  ",
    "@xmath6  relation derived by @xcite has been evaluated using only stellar dynamical black hole mass estimates from three - integral modeling .",
    "the result is that the black hole masses are about a factor of 3 lower than the ones published by @xcite which were used in @xcite .",
    "second @xcite found that seyferts are offset from the faber - jackson relation for normal galaxies having brighter bulges by on average about 0@xmath31.6 at the same velocity dispersion .",
    "more generally bulge - disk decomposition is a difficult task even for normal , nearby galaxies .",
    "the problem is compounded in seyfert 1 galaxies by their smaller apparent bulge sizes , due to larger mean distances , and the bright point source component .",
    "thus , much of the discrepancy can be resolved by acknowledging that as much or greater uncertainty exists in the bulge luminosity of seyferts as exists in the estimates of @xmath0  by any of the available techniques .",
    "using reliable measurements of black hole mass in agn we can compare parameters related to the energetics of agn with the size of the central engine .",
    "for example @xcite found a strong correlation between the black hole mass and the mean optical continuum luminosity , with the dependence @xmath32 , suggesting that more luminous agn radiate at a larger fraction of the eddington luminosity . @xcite found a correlation between @xmath1  and the radio luminosity at 1415 mhz , l@xmath33 , in seyfert galaxies .",
    "this relation was linked to previously known correlations between radio power and absolute blue luminosity @xcite and between radio power and [ oiii ] line width ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "they speculated that the origin of such a correlation might result from the correlation of @xmath0  with bulge mass and that the radio sources associated with larger central engines might be correspondingly more luminous . in figure",
    "[ fig : bhsigrad ] we plot @xmath34 vs. @xmath0 , plotting different symbols for radio - loud ( @xmath35 ) , radio - intermediate(@xmath36 ) and radio - quiet agn(@xmath37 ) .",
    "the criteria are chosen rather arbitrarily , but nevertheless demonstrate some interesting differences .",
    "the solid line shows a fit to the most radio - quiet group .",
    "the correlation is quite strong ( @xmath38 , p(null)=0.003% ) with a slope @xmath39 .",
    "a fit including radio - intermediate data ( not shown ) is somewhat weaker ( @xmath40 , p(null)=0.1% ) and a fit to the entire sample weaker still ( @xmath41 , p(null)=2% ) . the results suggest that at least in radio - quiet agn the radio luminosity , emitted on kpc scales is linked to the mass of the nuclear black hole . @xcite noted other explanations for their result , including higher ambient pressure in larger bulges leading to increased radio emissivity .",
    "we can not distinguish between these possibilities and it is possible that both effects work together to produce the observed correlation .",
    "using the assumption that nlr kinematics are predominantly due to virial motion in the host galaxy potential , we find that agn follow a relation between @xmath0  and @xmath6  similar to normal galaxies .",
    "although the agn black hole masses are determined using reverberation mapping , we find no significant differences with results from studies using stellar dynamical techniques .",
    "satisfied that the black hole masses in agn are reliable we can begin to examine the relationship of black hole mass with other properties of agn . as an example , we have found that the radio luminosity in radio - quiet agn is correlated with black hole mass relating parameters determined on vastly different size scales .",
