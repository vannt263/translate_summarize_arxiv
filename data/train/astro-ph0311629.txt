    ", we investigate whether other stars possess kuiper belt objects ( kbo s ) similar to those found in the solar system .",
    "we assume that the hypothetical kbo s around other stars resemble those in our solar system and have a composition of ice and dust similar to that of comets ( see luu & jewitt 2002 ) . during the main sequence phase of the star s evolution , the kbo s quiescently remain in stable orbits .",
    "however , when the star becomes a red giant , the kbo s become sufficiently hot that ice sublimates and previously embedded dust particles are ejected into the surroundings . in @xmath62 , we sketch our argument , which is presented in full detail in @xmath63 , that sufficient dust may be released during this red giant phase that the star can display a detectable infrared excess .",
    "stern , shull & brandt ( 1990 ) and ford & neufeld ( 2001 ) computed the fate of ice sublimated from comets that have orbital radii greater than 100 au when the host star evolves onto the asymptotic giant branch and attains a luminosity near 10@xmath7 l@xmath2 .",
    "now that the kuiper belt in the solar system with most objects lying near 45 au from the sun is becoming better understood ( luu & jewitt 2002 ) , it is possible to imagine the response of such a system to a star s first ascent up the red giant branch when its luminosity exceeds 100 l@xmath2 .",
    "however , although progress is being made , there are still significant uncertainties about the kuiper belt in the solar system .",
    "recent estimates of its mass range from 0.01 m@xmath5 ( bernstein et al .",
    "2003 ) to 0.1 m@xmath5 ( luu & jewitt 2002 ) . therefore",
    ", although we describe a procedure to investigate kuiper belt - like systems around other stars , our own outer solar system is so poorly understood that an exact comparison is not yet possible .",
    "two current descriptions of the kbo s differ mainly but not exclusively in estimates of the numbers of objects with radii smaller than @xmath0200 km . with the expectation that short period comets originate in the kuiper belt , luu & jewitt ( 2002 ) propose a rapid rise in the numbers of such smaller kbo s .",
    "in contrast to this expectation , bernstein et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used the hubble space telescope to search for kbo s as faint as 28.3 mag , corresponding to radii of @xmath015 km , and found many fewer objects than expected from the model given by luu & jewitt ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , with this observational result of bernstein et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the origin of the short period comets becomes a mystery .",
    "perhaps there is a bimodal distribution of kbo s . in this paper ,",
    "given the uncertainties in current knowledge of the outer solar system , we consider models both with and without large numbers of kbo s smaller than 200 km in radius .",
    "most first ascent red giants do not show any evidence for circumstellar dust .",
    "the minority of first ascent red giants with infrared excesses ( judge , jordan & rowan - robinson 1987 , jura 1990 , 1999 , kim , zuckerman & silverstone 2001 , smith 1998 , zuckerman , kim & liu 1995 , plets et al .",
    "1997 ) do not seem to have sublimating kbo s , since the characteristic inferred dust temperature is less than 70 k instead of 170 k , as we predict in @xmath63 . here , we focus on the possibility of detecting relatively warm dust from disintegrating kbo s .",
    "because the details of our model are somewhat complicated , we first present a schematic overview of our analysis , while the complete description is presented in @xmath63 . using our own kuiper belt as a prototype",
    ", we assume that the kbo s orbit the host star near 45 au . at this orbital separation , we find that most of the kbo material survives in the solid phase as long as the temperature is less than @xmath0150 k which occurs as long as the star is less luminous than @xmath0170 l@xmath2 .",
    "however , once the star s luminosity exceeds this value , the kbo s become warm enough that relatively rapid ice sublimation occurs . in the time interval , approximately characterized by the parameter @xmath8 , during which the star increases in luminosity from @xmath0170 l@xmath2 to @xmath0300 l@xmath2 , most of the mass of the kbo s is lost into their surroundings . as the kbo s are sublimating , some dust particles are released that continue to orbit the star .",
    "if sufficient mass is released from the kbo s , these orbiting dust grains can absorb enough light to produce a detectable infrared excess .",
    "if @xmath9 denotes the total initial mass of the kbo s and @xmath10 denotes the fraction of this mass which is ejected as dust particles that are large enough to remain in orbit around the star and are not blown out of the system by radiation pressure , then the total amount of mass that can orbit the star is @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the dust particles are spheres of radius @xmath12 and density @xmath13 , and they orbit the star of luminosity , @xmath14 , at distance , @xmath15 . while this assumption is relaxed in @xmath63.7 , here , for simplicity , we assume that @xmath15 does not change during a dust particle s evolution . also ,",
    "while other factors are considered in @xmath63.7 , here , we assume that the lifetime of the orbiting dust particles is controlled simply by the poynting - robertson time , @xmath16 . following burns , lamy & soter ( 1979 ) , we write : @xmath17    since the poynting robertson lifetime is typically shorter than the the characteristic evolutionary time on the red giant branch , at any given moment during the star s evolutionary phase when grains are being released , the fraction of orbiting material contributing to the infrared excess is @xmath18",
    ". if the grains have opacity , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 g@xmath21 ) , and if the circumstellar dust cloud is optically thin , then the total luminosity of the circumstellar dust , @xmath22 is scaled from the fractional dust coverage of an imaginary sphere of surface area 4@xmath23 by the relationship : @xmath24 we use a simple model of the grain opacity where the geometric cross section ( @xmath25 ) equals the total absorption cross section . in this case , since each dust grain has mass ( @xmath26 ) , we may write that : @xmath27 combining equations ( 1)-(3 ) , we find : @xmath28 expression ( 4 ) captures the essence of our model .",
    "the infrared luminosity simply scales as the rate of production of dust grains which varies as @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath10 and @xmath9 are sufficiently large , then the infrared excess may be detectable .",
    "our estimate of l@xmath30 , which is computed more exactly in @xmath63 , is independent of the size of the kbo s as long as these objects are fully destroyed by sublimation .    in @xmath63",
    ", we find characteristic values of @xmath10 @xmath31 0.25 and @xmath8 @xmath31 14 myr .",
    "therefore , if @xmath9 @xmath0 0.1 m@xmath5 , then from equation ( 4 ) , @xmath22 @xmath31 0.02 l@xmath2 . because the kbo s mostly sublimate near 170 k , the spectrum of this excess luminosity peaks at wavelengths near 25 @xmath1 m . in @xmath64",
    ", we show that a 170 k black body with a luminosity of 0.02 l@xmath2 is just at the threshold of having been detected with iras data for red giants with total luminosities less than 300 l@xmath2 .",

    ", we simply assume that all red giants have the same stellar wind drag and adopt @xmath130 = 0.4 , a value for this ratio close to that in the solar system .",
    "to use equation ( 44 ) , we also need to estimate @xmath152 . in the absence of any other effects ,",

    "however , before they sublimate , the particles orbits might be disrupted as they drift inwards by grain - grain collisions .",
    "in such collisions , the grains may shatter into pieces , some of which are small enough to be driven away from the star by radiation pressure .",
    "shattering may also produce more smaller grains with a net increase in surface area of the particles .",
    "if the radial optical depth through the circumstellar dust is @xmath153 , then , depending upon the velocity dispersion of the grains and their size and spatial distributions , the probability during one orbital period , @xmath154 , of a grain - grain collision may also be of order @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the mean time between collisions is @xmath155 . with an orbital period at 45 au of 300 yr and @xmath153 = 10@xmath156 ,",

    "therefore , as a very simple first approximation , grain - grain collisions are assumed to occur when the dust particle s orbital decay from the poynting - robertson drift has significantly changed its distance from the star .",
    "although detailed calculations are required ( see , for example , wyatt et al . 1999 ,",
    "krivov , mann & krivova 2000 ) , we adopt @xmath136 = 0.5 @xmath82as a crude representation of the effects of grain - grain collisions .",

    "in @xmath63 , we have calculated the excess luminosity produced by a cloud of sublimating kbo s .",
    "we now show that this radiation may be detectable .",
    "to measure the amount of excess radiation that a red giant exhibits at 25 @xmath1 m , we need to determine its photospheric emission at this wavelength .",
    "previous studies of first ascent red giants have shown that the bulk of the detected flux at 12 @xmath1 m , f@xmath161(12 @xmath1 m ) , emerges from a star s photosphere ( see , for example , jura , webb & kahane 2001 , knauer , ivezic & knapp 2001 ) . here",

    "the sample of 66 stars from which the data are obtained has a mixture of surface gravities and abundances , and the intrinsic distribution of @xmath164 around its mean value may be skewed .",

    "these infrared excesses are so small that it is very difficult to infer a dust temperature , and this evidence is at best a weak hint that these stars possess sublimating kbo s .    from figure 3 , the we see that the data points usually lie below the theoretical curve for the regime where initially there are many kbo s smaller than 200 km in radius . therefore , we find that the production of dust from systems containing comet - like bodies can produce a detectable infrared excess if the total mass of the kbo s is at least 0.1 m@xmath5",
    ". we can also see from figure 3 that if initially there are only kbo s with a radius larger than 200 km , then a kbo system similar to that in own solar system would not produce a detectable infrared excess around most red giants .",
    "however , this calculation was performed with @xmath60 = 0.02 m@xmath5 .",
    "if , instead , we assume that @xmath60 @xmath31 0.1 m@xmath5 , then the predicted fluxes would be a factor of five larger than shown .",
    "in this case , the data points would then lie below the computed line and an infrared excess would be detectable .",
    "thus , as anticipated in our discussion in @xmath62 , regardless of the exact size distribution , we expect that an infrared excess might be detectable if the total mass of the kbo system lying at 45 au orbital radius is larger than 0.1 m@xmath5 .",
    "our main argument is that as a star evolves on the red giant phase , it is possible to constrain the mass of the kbo s of the system . here , we consider how our results compare with other investigations of the outer regions of our solar system and its analogs among other stars .",
    "while sublimation of kbo s at an orbital radius of 45 au might lead to a detectable infrared excess during a star s red giant evolution , our analysis does not provide strong constraints on the mass of kbo s much further than 50 au .",
    "melnick et al . ( 2001 ) , ford & neufeld ( 2001 ) and ford et al . ( 2003 ) have proposed that in order to account for the detected circumstellar h@xmath79o and oh around the mass - losing carbon star irc+10216 , there is a cloud of comets at @xmath0300 au with a mass of at least @xmath010 m@xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , our typical upper limit to the mass in comet - like objects is @xmath00.1 m@xmath5 at @xmath0 45 au .",
    "this apparent mass gradient of kbo s is remarkable and deserves further study .",
    "main sequence stars often possess from 0.01 m@xmath5 to 0.1 m@xmath5 of dust at orbital separations of typically between 10 au and 100 au ( see zuckerman 2001 ) .",
    "our results for evolving red giants are consistent with the hypothesis that there may be as much as an additional @xmath0 0.1 m@xmath5 in icy comets closer than @xmath050 au around most main sequence stars .",
    "however , it appears that macroscopic kbo s with radii greater than 1 km do not overwhelmingly dominate the mass budgets of solid material orbiting beyond 10 au around those main sequence stars with measured amounts of dust .",
    "the total mass of the kbo s in orbit around our sun is somewhere between 0.01 m@xmath5 and 0.1 m@xmath5 .",
    "even the larger value is much less mass than predicted by extrapolations from the inner solar system for the initial solar nebula ( luu & jewitt 2002 ) .",
    "our upper limits for the mass of systems of kbo s around red giants shows that the analogs to the kuiper belt also have similarly  low \" masses at orbital radii less than 50 au .",
    "very precise measurements of the fluxes from red giants in comparison with model atmospheres may allow for a more reliable determination of whether they possess infrared excesses .",
    "if the photospheric flux could be estimated to within 1% , instead of 10% , it would be possible to improve estimates of the masses of the kbo systems by a factor of 10 .",
    "with such a capability , we could determine whether the hint in the data of some stars having kbo s of @xmath00.1 m@xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we have focused on the production of an infrared excess by sublimation of comets .",
    "our calculations do not pertain to those red giants where an infrared excess with a characteristic dust temperature of @xmath070 k is measured that is produced by @xmath00.1 m@xmath5 of dust at @xmath0200 au from the star ( jura 1999 ) .",
    "the origin of this dust is uncertain ; at least in some cases , confusion with interstellar cirrus is possible .",
    "further work is required to understand the nature of this material .",
    "we have computed the evolution of a system of kbo s when a star becomes a red giant . for kbo s at 45 au from the host star , we find that the dust released during the sublimation of ice from these objects might produce a detectable infrared excess around red giants of luminosities in the range 200 l@xmath2 to 300 l@xmath2 if the mass of the kbo s is at least 0.1 m@xmath5 . to date",
