    "the diffuse x - ray background of the milky way has been studied for over 30 years and yet relatively little is known about the distribution of its emission in the galactic plane .",
    "most diffuse galactic emission arises from @xmath3k plasma @xcite , but the origin and distribution of this plasma are still debated .",
    "two factors are responsible for the difficulty in determining the distribution of this plasma : confusion and absorption .",
    "confusion arises because one can not determine the origin of an individual x - ray .",
    "even though most x - rays contributing to the diffuse background of the milky way are thermal in origin and the spectra of this plasma show strong line emission , the available x - ray detector energy resolution is insufficient to provide velocity ( and therefore distance ) information .",
    "thus it is very difficult to determine the true distribution of x - ray emitting plasma along a given line of sight .",
    "shadowing experiments are the only way to determine the distribution of hot plasma in the plane of the milky way .",
    "to date , they have been used primarily in the @xmath4  kev  band to study the distribution of 0.1  kev plasma within the local hot bubble and in the lower halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . a few shadowing experiments at higher energy ( @xmath0  kev  and 1.5  kev ) using _ rosat _ data ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown evidence for the existence of an extensive distribution of hot plasma well within the solar circle .",
    "this emission has been linked to the milky way x - ray bulge which has a scale height of @xmath5  kpc and a radial extent of @xmath6  kpc @xcite , but there are likely additional components distributed throughout the galactic disk .",
    "most studies of the x - ray background have focused on the local hot bubble ( lhb ) .",
    "the lhb is a region of about 100pc in radius , surrounding the sun filled with a hot , rarefied @xmath7k plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "beginning with @xcite , many groups have effectively mapped the distribution of this gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have shown the utility of x - ray shadowing in mapping a large region of the sky at higher galactic latitudes . here",
    "we utilize similar techniques but extend the analysis to larger distances in the galactic plane using dense molecular clouds .",
    "infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) are very dense molecular clouds that appear dark at infrared wavelengths .",
    "they are seen in absorption against the mid - ir background .",
    "irdcs were first identified as a significant population in the _ midcourse space experiment _ ( _ msx _ ) mid - infrared data @xcite , and are a ubiquitous feature of the higher resolution galactic legacy infrared survey extraordinaire ( glimpse : * ? ? ?",
    "irdcs have very high column densities of @xmath8 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s06 ) , and possibly as high as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "they exist at a wide range of distances and are most easily seen in the plane of the galaxy ( s06 ) .",
    "s06 found distances to 313 irdcs using the galactic ring survey of @xmath10  emission ( grs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to establish a morphological match between the @xmath10  gas and the mid - infrared extinction . using the rotation curve of @xcite , s06 converted the velocity of the associated @xmath10  gas into a distance to the irdc . in the inner galaxy ( the focus of the present study ) , every velocity has two possible distance solutions .",
    "irdcs , however , are seen in absorption against the galactic plane and therefore the near distance can be assumed .",
    "irdcs make ideal x - ray shadowing candidates .",
    "their high column densities make them effective absorbers of background x - ray photons ; x - ray emission from the direction of the irdc must originate in the foreground .",
    "thus , using irdc absorption , one can separate foreground and background x - ray components .",
    "the distribution of irdcs also spans a wide range of distances ( see s06 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with enough x - ray absorption measurements of irdcs along different lines of sight ,",
    "an accurate map of the hot ism may be created .",
    "the present study includes two clouds from the catalog of s06 that have high column densities , large angular sizes , and are closely grouped on the sky . our goal is to select clouds that would cause complete absorption of x - ray photons originating behind the cloud .",
    "the models given in @xcite predict that a total column density of @xmath11 will absorb @xmath12 of incident photons at @xmath0  kev .",
    "column densities of @xmath13 are frequently found for irdcs ( see s06 ) . to ensure sufficient counts in both the on and off  cloud directions , the target irdcs should cover approximately half the _ xmm - newton_detector .",
    "our ideal situation is one in which there are multiple large clouds closely grouped on the sky but at various distances .",
    "the close grouping allows one to disentangle the emission components along a given line of sight .",
    "the properties of the two irdcs observed by _ xmm - newton _  are summarized in table  [ tab : prop ] . listed",
    "are the irdc name , the galactic longitude and latitude , the angular size , and the molecular column density .",
    "all parameters in table  [ tab : prop ] are reproduced from s06 .",
    "the two target clouds have high column densities , large angular sizes , and are near @xmath14 .",
    "the mid - infrared emission of the two irdc fields is shown in figure  [ fig : clouds ] .",
    "the background image in this figure is from the glimpse 8  survey @xcite and the contours are @xmath10  integrated intensity from the grs .",
    "we have created the integrated intensity map using the lsr velocity and line width from the s06 catalog .",
    "tick - marks on the contours indicate the direction of decreasing @xmath10  integrated intensity .",
    "the large circle in this figure is approximately the _ xmm - newton _  field of view ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "immediately evident in this figure is the excellent morphological match between the grs @xmath10  contours and the strong mid - infrared extinction .",
    "the molecular clouds associated with the irdcs take up a significant fraction of the _ xmm - newton _  field of view .",
    "irdc g28.37 + 0.07  is located at the center of a large , dense molecular cloud which is roughly ellipsoidal in projection .",
    "the two clouds are at very different distances , g28.37 + 0.07  lies @xmath16 kpc from the sun and g36.67@xmath170.11  lies @xmath18 kpc from the sun ( s06 ) .",
    "our clouds were observed by _ xmm - newton _  on 2006 april 11 for 25 ks each ( irdc g28.37 + 0.07  with _ xmm - newton _  obsid 0302970301 and irdc g36.67@xmath170.11   with obsid 0302970201 ) .",
    "one of us ( sls ) has developed a powerful suite of _ perl _ and _ fortran _ scripts to analyze _ xmm - newton _  extended source data called xmm - esas @xcite .",
    "this software is based on the background modeling described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the software currently only operates on the mos detector data and subsequent to this analysis has been incorporated into the _ xmm - newton_mission standard analysis software ( sas ) package .",
    "to remove intervals of high soft proton contamination , we must first temporally filter and clean the events file .",
    "the signature of soft proton contamination is a fluctuating light curve .",
    "the xmm - esas software creates a count rate histogram and fits a gaussian to the peak of the histogram . in observations with minimal contamination",
    ", this histogram would appear gaussian ; a non - gaussian shape to the distribution is also indicative of soft - proton contamination .",
    "the software defines count - rate intervals within @xmath19 of the median count rate as acceptable , and filters the events file to remove intervals that do not satisfy this criterion .",
    "while effective at removing intermittent contamination , this process does not remove consistent low - level contamination that is also likely present .",
    "the light - curve for g28.37 + 0.07  is quite steady and almost all the data are useable .",
    "the light - curve of g36.67@xmath170.11 , however , indicates a high level of soft proton contamination and only @xmath20 of the observation time is usable .",
    "an estimate of the total column density to each irdc can drastically improve the reliability and accuracy of the x - ray spectral fitting . above 0.5 kev , the most significant source of x - ray absorption is metals . with normal abundances ,",
    "the total x - ray opacity should be proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we estimate the molecular column density using the @xmath10  emission from the grs , and estimate the atomic column density using the 21 cm hi  vla galactic plane survey ( vgps : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our spectral fitting procedure treats the on and off  cloud spectra separately ( as do all x - ray shadowing experiments ) .",
    "this is the only way one can separate components of the x - ray background that originate in front of the cloud from those that originate behind it .",
    "one must therefore compute on and off  cloud column densities separately .",
    "we do this by first defining the on and off  cloud regions .",
    "one of us ( lda ) has developed an astronomical software program in idl .",
    "this software allows one to define regions of interest in an image using a threshold selection tool . the user can vary the threshold upwards or downwards to define smaller or larger regions .",
    "the output of this thresholding selection , the _ x _ and _ y _ positions of the data points on the threshold boundary in sky coordinates , can then be converted to detector coordinates within the software , as is appropriate for analysis in the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis software ( sas ) .",
    "this conversion employs the sas program _ edet2sky _",
    "repeatedly for each coordinate pair to convert from a region in sky coordinates to a region in detector coordinates .",
    "using our idl software , we define the on  cloud region as the sky positions possessing both high mid - infrared extinction and high @xmath10column density .",
    "our goal is to create a region large enough to have sufficient counts in the on  cloud region for good statistics .",
    "ideally , the on and off  cloud regions would each cover half the _ xmm - newton _  field of view .",
    "the off  cloud region encompasses all locations in the _ xmm - newton _  field of view not including the on  cloud region .",
    "the on  cloud region roughly corresponds to the largest contour in figure  [ fig : clouds ] .",
    "we must separate the total molecular column density into a component foreground to the irdc and a component beyond the irdc .",
    "we therefore must estimate the distances to the molecular gas clumps that contribute to the column density in the _ xmm - newton _  field of view . in the first galactic quadrant ( where the target irdcs lie ) , each radial velocity has two possible distance solutions , a `` near '' and a `` far '' distance .",
    "this problem is known as the kinematic distance ambiguity ( kda ) .",
    "gas along the same line of sight as an irdc could lie either in front of or behind the cloud .",
    "this problem is illustrated in figure  [ fig : kda ] for irdc g28.37 + 0.07 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kda ] shows the loci of distances from the sun corresponding to a particular velocity , assuming the galactic rotation curve of @xcite .",
    "the two - fold distance degeneracy is clearly shown .",
    "because irdcs are seen in absorption , we assume they lie at the near distance .",
    "the cloud velocity of 78.6 @xmath22  places g28.37 + 0.07  at a distance of 4.8 @xmath2  from the sun .",
    "any gas with a velocity greater than 78.6 @xmath22  must lie beyond the cloud .",
    "molecular gas at velocities less than 78.6 @xmath22 , however , could lie at either the near or the far distance .",
    "hi  self - absorption ( hi sa ) can remove the distance ambiguity of the molecular gas clumps in the _ xmm - newton _  field of view .",
    "this technique relies on cold foreground hi  absorbing the emission of warm background hi  at the same velocity .",
    "warm hi  is ubiquitous in our galaxy and emits at all allowed velocities .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that molecular clouds must contain hi , a result which has been confirmed in numerous subsequent observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this small population of cold neutral hi  atoms inside molecular clouds is maintained by interactions with cosmic rays .",
    "the hi  inside molecular clouds at the near distance will produce an absorption signal because there is ample warm hi  emitting at the same velocity at the far distance .",
    "any cloud at the far distance should not show hi sa  because there is no background hi  emitting at the same velocity .",
    "hi sa  is therefore a general technique for finding distances to molecular clouds .",
    "this technique was shown by @xcite to be effective at resolving the kda for a dense molecular cloud , by @xcite for resolving the kda for young stellar objects , and by @xcite for resolving the kda for the molecular gas associated with hii  regions , and by @xcite for resolving the kda for grs molecular clouds .",
    "we utilize the procedure outlined in @xcite to convert from grs @xmath10  emission line parameters into an estimate of column density .",
    "this procedure assumes a standard co excitation temperature of 10k .",
    "the conversion equation is : @xmath23\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the main beam line intensity in degrees kelvin and @xmath25 is the line width in @xmath22 .",
    "the column density found using this procedure is accurate to within a factor of @xmath18 due to uncertainties in the conversion from @xmath10  to @xmath26 .    to find the molecular column densities for both on and off  cloud directions , we calculate the column density of all significant @xmath10  molecular clumps in the _ xmm - newton _  field of view by first fitting gaussians to the average on and off cloud grs spectra .",
    "we transform the line parameters derived from these gaussians into column densities using equation  [ eqn : n_co ] .",
    "the application of equation  [ eqn : n_co ] computes the total column density along each line of sight , but gives no information about whether the components lie at the near or the far distance . by examining the average @xmath10  and hi  spectrum of each molecular clump in the _ xmm - newton _  field of view for hi sa , we determine whether the near or the far distance is appropriate for each molecular clump .",
    "we assign the column densities of the molecular clumps found to lie in front of the target cloud to the foreground component , and the column densities of the molecular clumps found to lie behind to the target cloud to the background component .",
    "we use a similar procedure to calculate the hi  column density using the vgps .",
    "the conversion to hi  column density employs the equation : @xmath27\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the hi  spin temperature in degrees kelvin , and @xmath29 is given in @xmath22 . for hi ,",
    "the spin temperature is much less well constrained compared to the excitation temperature of @xmath10 .",
    "a good average value between the hot and cool hi  components is 150k ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "equation  [ eqn : n_hi ] , requires an estimate of the optical depth for the hi  line using the equation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the optical depth of hi , @xmath32 is the hi  line intensity , @xmath28 is the hi  spin temperature , and @xmath33 is the intensity from background sources . the largest source of background emission is the cosmic microwave background ; because it produces a negligible effect at 21 cm , we ignore its contribution here . assuming a spin temperature of 40k",
    "lowers our calculated column densities by a factor of @xmath18 .    for hi",
    "there is less information about whether the gas originates in front of or behind the cloud compared to co. as we did for @xmath10 , we compute average on and off  cloud spectra .",
    "a typical hi  spectrum does not show distinct , clean lines .",
    "we therefore compute the area under the curve directly , instead of fitting gaussians , and convert this to hi  column density using equations  [ eqn : n_hi ] and [ eqn : tau_hi ] .",
    "we assume that the hi  is uniformly distributed along the line of sight to a distance of 15kpc from the sun and split the column density distribution into foreground and background components , weighted by the distance to the cloud .",
    "for example , we assume g28.37 + 0.07  ( at a distance of 5kpc ) has 33% of the total hi  along the line of sight in the foreground component , and 67% in the background component .",
    "our values for the total hi  column density are in very good agreement with those in the the leiden / argentine / bonn hi  survey @xcite and the hi  survey of @xcite as found using the heasarc online tool .",
    "figure  [ fig : hisa ] shows the average on ( solid curves ) and off  cloud ( dashed curves ) spectra of @xmath10  ( black curves ) and hi  ( gray curves ) for figure  [ fig : hisa ] . for g28.37 + 0.07 , hi  absorption is seen at the velocity of all @xmath10  components with velocities less than the cloud velocity of 78.6 @xmath22(this is clearer when analyzing each clump individually ) .",
    "therefore , we assign all @xmath10  emission not associated with g28.37 + 0.07  that has velocities less than 76.6@xmath22  to the near component .",
    "we assign all @xmath10  features with velocities greater than 78.6@xmath22  to the far component .",
    "also evident in figure  [ fig : hisa ] is the strong hi  absorption at the cloud velocity , which shows clearly that the cloud is at the near distance .",
    "the hi  emission is less strongly peaked than the @xmath10  emission .",
    "the results of our column density modeling are summarized in table  [ tab : column ] .",
    "this table gives the column density of atomic hydrogen , @xmath34 , molecular hydrogen @xmath35 , and the total column density , @xmath36 in units of @xmath37@xmath38  for g28.37 + 0.07  and g36.67@xmath170.11 .",
    "the contributions to the column density are given for the foreground and background components for the on and off  cloud directions .",
    "the background component includes the contributions from the irdcs themselves .",
    "using our cleaned events files , we extract the x - ray spectra for both the on and off  cloud regions in preparation for spectral fitting .",
    "our on and off  cloud regions are defined as before and correspond to high infrared extinction and high @xmath10  column density .",
    "we extract spectra from both mos detectors and create auxiliary response files ( arfs ) , redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) , and background spectra .",
    "we increase the signal to noise by binning these spectra so there are at least 20 counts per spectral channel .",
    "we use xspec v11.3.2 @xcite for the spectral analysis .    for the spectral fits , we assume the emission can be described as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the measured x - ray flux , @xmath41 is the contribution from soft proton contamination , @xmath42 is the emission from the lhb , @xmath43 is the galactic x - ray emission foreground to the cloud , @xmath44 is the galactic x - ray emission background to the cloud , @xmath45 is the emission from the galactic ridge , and @xmath46 is the x - ray background from unresolved active galactic nuclei .",
    "there are three column density parameters in our models , one associated with @xmath43 , one with @xmath44 , and one with both @xmath45 and @xmath47 the fitted column density associated with @xmath44 is poorly constrained ( see below ) , which is why we do not treat the column density associated with @xmath45 and @xmath46 as the sum of that affecting @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "below we describe in more detail the various model components we use to model the x - ray background and to separate foreground from background emission .",
    "there are two main sources of contamination in our spectra .",
    "first , there is residual soft proton contamination not removed through time filtering ( @xmath41 in equation  [ eq : compts ] ) .",
    "this component should have a power law distribution of energies , so we model its emission using the xspec model pow / b .",
    "this xspec component models a power - law noise distribution not folded through the instrument response . secondly , there are two fluorescent instrumental lines of al k@xmath48 and si k@xmath48 near 1.6 kev .",
    "we assume a gaussian shape for these lines and fit them explicitly .",
    "our models include three components for the x - ray background , as in @xcite . along each line of sight , first there is @xmath49 kev  emission from the lhb @xcite , @xmath42 .",
    "we fit the the lhb emission with the xspec model apec @xcite , which represents collisionally - ionized diffuse plasma .",
    "next , we assume that there are two components of the x - ray background emission in the galactic plane : one soft ( @xmath50 1 kev ) and one hard ( few kev ) , @xmath45 . for these components",
    "we use the xspec model wabs @xmath51 apec , which represents collisionally - ionized diffuse plasma attenuated by material along the line of sight .",
    "the soft component itself can be divided into two sources : emission in front of the irdc , @xmath43 , and emission from beyond the irdc , @xmath44 . finally , there is extragalactic emission from unresolved agn in the field , @xmath46 .",
    "we model the contribution from agn using a power law model with absorption , wabs @xmath51 pow , where the power law index is set to @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be the dominant component above 1 kev  @xcite .",

    "the same shadow that appears in the 0.351.25 band also appears in the 2.08.0 kev  band .",
    "as there should not be strong absorption in the 2.08.0 kev  band , this indicates that the `` shadow '' is a product of the detector , and not of the cloud itself .",
    "we conclude that the imaging analysis supports the spectral analysis and finds no x - ray shadow of the cooler component to the x - ray background .",
    "we have conducted x - ray shadowing experiments on two infrared dark clouds near @xmath96 at distances of 2 and 5 kpc from the sun to determine the spatial distribution of the x - ray background .",
