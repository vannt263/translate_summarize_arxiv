    "the original motivation for the study of kaon - pair production in the @xmath8 reaction near threshold was the investigation of the structure of the scalar mesons @xmath9 or @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "such measurements were initially performed by the cosy-11 collaboration at several different excess energies below the @xmath1-meson production threshold  @xcite .",
    "however , their results showed that scalar meson production can not in fact be the dominant driving mechanism in kaon pair production  @xcite and that the data can be explained without the explicit inclusion of the @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , they showed that the @xmath4 and @xmath12 invariant mass spectra were strongly distorted , presumably by the @xmath4 final state interaction ( fsi )  @xcite .",
    "this was most apparent in the ratio of the differential cross sections in terms of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 invariant masses .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction was also investigated with higher statistics above the threshold for the production of the @xmath1 meson , mainly with the aim of investigating the properties of that meson  @xcite . after removing the @xmath1 contribution in the spectra",
    ", it was clear that the @xmath4 and @xmath12 distributions in the non-@xmath1 data were both strongly influenced by the @xmath4 interaction  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this is connected with the production of the @xmath14 excited hyperon  @xcite , which might be treated as a @xmath15 quasi - bound state with a width that overlaps the @xmath15 threshold  @xcite .",
    "this idea was put on a quantitative footing by assuming that the @xmath14 was formed through the decay @xmath16  @xcite . the strength and details of the @xmath15 interaction are clearly important elements in the interpretation of possible kaon nuclear systems , such as the deeply bound @xmath12 states  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath4 fsi , and one between the two protons , the data also showed an enhancement at low @xmath5 invariant masses with some possible structure at the @xmath6 threshold  @xcite .",
    "though the effects are small , they might be influenced by the @xmath9 or @xmath10 scalar mesons .",
    "however , the investigation of this region was hampered by the need to separate the non-@xmath1 from the @xmath1 contribution and the fact that the data were spread over a very wide range of @xmath5 invariant masses .",
    "measurements below the @xmath1 threshold can provide useful information on these interesting fsi effects without suffering the distortion of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "however , the limited statistics in the low - energy cosy-11 data  @xcite are insufficient for detailed studies .",
    "previous measurements of the @xmath0 reaction were carried out at the cosy - anke magnetic spectrometer at @xmath17 , 67 , and 108  mev  @xcite , where the @xmath1 threshold is at @xmath18  mev . here",
    "the excess energy is defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total center - of - mass energy and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the particle masses in the final state . because of the limited acceptance of this spectrometer , an ansatz has to be made regarding the distribution of events over the four - body phase space in order to convert count rates into cross sections .",
    "this was done assuming that the distortions were the products of those present in the two - particle subsystems .",
    "all the anke non-@xmath1 data seemed to be consistent with an _ effective _ scattering length of @xmath23  fm with no obvious influence of an energy dependence associated with an effective range term .",
    "the dominance of the imaginary part is not unexpected because of the strong couplings to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels but , due to the presence of two other final - state particles , this parameter is not necessarily an intrinsic feature of the isolated @xmath4 system .",
    "the anke measurements at three excess energies also showed some enhancement at low @xmath5 invariant masses but with at least a break of slope at the @xmath6 threshold . a combined analysis of all the results in this region  @xcite shows that the data can be understood in terms of a final state interaction involving both @xmath5 elastic scattering plus a contribution from the @xmath26 charge exchange .",
    "although suggestive , the data are not sufficient to draw firm conclusions .",
    "in this paper we present much more precise @xmath0 differential cross section data at a beam energy of @xmath27  gev ( @xmath28  mev ) obtained using the cosy - anke spectrometer . with high statistics on the reaction below the @xmath1-meson threshold",
    ", we can study the effects of the final state interactions in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 systems in greater details .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the experimental setup and data analysis in sec  [ experiment ] . given that the procedures involved are similar to those employed at higher energies  @xcite",
    ", this can be quite brief .",
    "the fitting of the phenomenological parametrization to the raw @xmath0 data in order to make acceptance corrections is also described here .",
    "the resulting differential cross sections and total cross section for the @xmath0 reaction are presented in sec  [ results ] , followed by our conclusions in sec  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0 reaction was performed at an internal target station of the cooler synchrotron ( cosy ) of the forschungszentrum jlich  @xcite .",
    "the anke spectrometer  @xcite , which consists of three dipole magnets , registers positively and negatively charged ejectiles in the side detection systems , with the fast positively charged particles being detected in the forward detector .",
    "particle identification relies on time - of - flight measurements  @xcite from start and stop counters , and momentum information obtained from the multiwire proportional chambers .",
    "missing - mass distribution in the @xmath29 reaction at @xmath27  gev .",
    "the hatched histogram shows the cuts imposed for the selection of the non - detected proton .",
    "the solid line , which is a second - order polynomial fit , was used to estimate the background contribution under the proton peak . ]    in close - to - threshold production experiments , the total cross section changes very rapidly with small changes in the excess energy .",
    "the proton beam energy , @xmath30  gev , was therefore determined very precisely through a careful monitoring of the schottky spectra  @xcite .",
    "the resulting value of the excess energy with respect to the @xmath31 production threshold , @xmath28  mev , is well below the nominal @xmath1 threshold .",
    "however it should be noted that this is an average value , since the beam energy decreases by up to 4.6  mev through the course of a machine cycle due to the interaction with the target .",
    "this effect was also investigated in the simulation .",
    "the experiment relied on a triple - coincidence , involving the observation of a @xmath5 pair in the side detectors and a fast proton in the forward detector .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction was then identified by requiring that the missing mass of the @xmath32 system be consistent with that of a proton . in the analysis , a @xmath33 ( @xmath34  mev/@xmath35 )",
    "cut was applied on the missing - mass distribution of the selected @xmath32 events , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mm2.57 ] .",
    "the fraction of misidentified events inside the cut window around the proton mass was estimated to be about 5% , which was subtracted from the peak using weighted data from the side bands , as parameterized by the solid line .",
    "any ambiguity in this procedure , which is less than 3% , is one source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "reaction at @xmath28  mev .",
    "vertical bars represent the statistical uncertainties and horizontal ones the bin widths .",
    "the individual panels are ( a ) the cosine of the polar angle of the @xmath36 in the @xmath5 reference frame , ( b ) the polar angle of the kaon pairs in the overall c.m .",
    "frame , ( c ) the polar angle of the emitted proton in the @xmath37 reference frame relative to the beam direction , ( d ) the polar angle of the proton in the @xmath37 reference frame relative to the direction of the kaon pair , ( e ) the proton momentum in the @xmath37 reference frame , and ( f ) the @xmath32 invariant mass distribution . ]    after identifying clean @xmath0 events in anke , acceptance corrections must be performed in order to evaluate differential cross sections .",
    "the simple ansatz used on data taken above the @xmath1 meson production threshold tried to take into account the influence of final state interactions in the various two - particle subsystems  @xcite .",
    "this ansatz , which is also the basis for the current simulation , assumes that the overall enhancement factor @xmath38 is the product of enhancements in the @xmath37 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 systems : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the magnitudes of the relative momenta in the @xmath37 , the two @xmath4 , and the @xmath5 system , respectively .",
    "it is believed that the @xmath13 interaction might be weakly repulsive and , if so , its neglect would be interpreted as extra attraction in the @xmath4 system .",
    "the fsi enhancement in the @xmath4 case was calculated in the scattering length approximation , @xmath44 and the best fit to the higher energy data  @xcite was found with a purely imaginary effective scattering length , @xmath45  fm .",
    "the proton - proton enhancement factor was derived from the jost function  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement factor in the @xmath5 system takes into account elastic @xmath5 scattering plus the charge - exchange @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the seven degrees of freedom required to describe the unpolarized @xmath31 final state were chosen to be four angles , the @xmath46 and @xmath47 invariant masses , and the relative momentum of the protons in the @xmath37 system  @xcite .",
    "distributions in these seven variables were generated inside the anke acceptance and compared with the experimental data , some of which are shown in fig .",
    "the best fit to the data was achieved with @xmath48  fm , which is significantly larger in magnitude than the starting value of @xmath49  fm .",
    "the uncertainty in the real part is large and strongly correlated with the imaginary part . to allow easy comparison with the analysis of the higher energy data  @xcite ,",
    "the effective scattering length was taken to be purely imaginary .",
    "the @xmath50 scattering lengths for isospin - one and zero were taken as in our previous work  @xcite and the ratio of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 production amplitudes of @xmath53-wave @xmath54 pairs was parameterized as @xmath55 .",
    "the best fit was obtained with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are consistent with our earlier evaluation  @xcite based on the above @xmath1 threshold data .",
    "the resulting descriptions of the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ raw ] are very good and certainly sufficient for evaluating the acceptance corrections .",
    "the luminosity needed in the analysis was determined with an overall systematic uncertainty of 9% by measuring @xmath37 elastic scattering in the forward detector  @xcite .",
    "this was checked by simultaneous studies of the beam current and schottky spectra  @xcite , which could fix the absolute luminosity with a systematic uncertainty of 6% . within these uncertainties",
    "the two methods agreed but , in order to be coherent with our previous work , the luminosity extracted from the @xmath37 elastic scattering data was used in the final analysis .",
    "invariant mass distribution for the @xmath0 reaction at @xmath28  mev .",
    "the dotted curve shows the four - body phase space simulation whereas the inclusion of the final state interactions through eq .   gives the dashed curve for @xmath49  fm and the red solid curve @xmath58  fm .",

    "this was done separately with effective scattering lengths of @xmath49  fm and @xmath58  fm .",
    "the most striking features in the data are the strength near the @xmath5 threshold and the dip at @xmath59  gev/@xmath35 , which corresponds precisely to the @xmath60 production threshold  @xcite .",
    "this is compelling evidence for a cusp effect coming from the @xmath61 transitions . to investigate this phenomenon in greater detail ,",
    "the @xmath5 invariant mass distribution was divided by a simulation where only the final state interactions in the @xmath37 and @xmath4 , with @xmath58  fm , were considered .",
    "the best fit to the data shown in fig .  [ enhance ] is achieved with a contribution from the isospin - zero channel that is about three times stronger than the isospin - one .",

    "the low mass enhancements in figs .",
    "[ ratio_pk]c and [ ratio_ppk]c clearly indicate once again that the @xmath0 reaction can not be dominated by the undistorted production of a single scalar resonance @xmath68 or @xmath69 . within a four - body phase space simulation",
    "both ratios should be constant and equal to one and such a simulation also fails to describe the individual @xmath70 and @xmath71 distributions . whereas the inclusion of a @xmath4 fsi with an effective scattering length @xmath49  fm improves the situation , it overestimates the data in the high invariant mass regions for both @xmath65 and @xmath67 . with the larger effective scattering length @xmath58  fm , these ratios , as well as the individual distributions , can be well reproduced . within the product ansatz of eq .",
    "the @xmath4 final state interaction effectively becomes stronger at lower excess energies .",

    "[ ratio_pk]b at low invariant masses .",
    "since the @xmath7 threshold is at 1437.2  gev/@xmath35 , this suggests that the data in this region might also be influenced by @xmath72 channel coupling .    due to the low statistics , the cosy-11 data at 10 and 28  mev  @xcite can not distinguish between predictions based on effective scattering lengths of @xmath49  fm and @xmath58  fm .",

    "the total cross section result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ txs ] along with previous measurements from disto  @xcite , cosy-11  @xcite , and anke  @xcite .",
    "the new point seems high compared to the cosy-11 result at @xmath76  mev but it should be noted that this value was already increased by 50% compared to that originally quoted .",
    "this was achieved through a re - analysis of the data that included @xmath37 and @xmath4 final state interactions with @xmath49  fm  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that a further increase might follow if the @xmath5 final state interaction were included in the evaluation of the acceptance corrections as well as an effective scattering length of @xmath58  fm was used instead .",

    "the predictions of a one - boson exchange model are represented by the dashed line  @xcite . ]",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ txs ] that the four - body phase space can not reproduce the energy dependence of the total cross section . with the inclusion of the @xmath37 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 fsi , with an effective scattering length of @xmath49  fm , the data above the @xmath1 threshold can be described well but those at lower energy are significantly underestimated .",
    "an increase in the value of @xmath78 might help in this region but the coincidence of strong effects in different two- or even three - body channels must also bring the factorization assumption of eq .   into question .",
    "the dashed line , which represents a calculation within a one - boson exchange model  @xcite , also underestimates the near - threshold data .",
    "this model includes energy dependent input derived from fits to the @xmath79 total cross sections , though it does not include the @xmath37 final state interaction .",
    "the production of @xmath5 pairs has been measured in the @xmath0 reaction channel at an excess energy of @xmath28  mev .",
    "even taking its 4.3  mev/@xmath35 width into account , this is well below the central @xmath1-meson threshold at 32.1  mev .",
    "the reaction was identified in anke through a triple coincidence of a @xmath5 pair and a forward - going proton , with an additional cut on the @xmath32 missing - mass spectrum .",
    "the high statistics and low excess energy allow us to produce a detailed @xmath5 invariant mass distribution below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "the distortion of both the @xmath4 and @xmath12 spectra , which are even stronger than in our higher energy data , can be explained quantitatively within the product ansatz of eq .   with an effective @xmath4 scattering length @xmath80  fm .",
    "this is to be compared with the @xmath74  fm obtained from the analysis of data measured above the @xmath1 production threshold .",
    "a full treatment of the dynamics of the four - body @xmath31 channel is currently impractical . as a consequence ,",
    "an energy dependence of @xmath78 is possible because this is merely an effective parameter within a very simplistic description of the four - body final state interaction .",
    "the strong @xmath4 final state interaction may be connected with the @xmath14 in the production process and it has been suggested  @xcite that the production of non-@xmath1 kaon pairs proceeds mainly through the associated production @xmath81 .",
    "this would also lead to deviations from the simple product ansatz for the final state interactions , not least because an attraction between the @xmath14 and the proton would involve three final particles .",
    "our results show a very strong preference for low @xmath12 masses and this effect seems to be even more marked than in the higher energy data  @xcite .",
    "although this might be connected with the ideas of a @xmath12 deeply bound state  @xcite , it must be stressed that our data were measured far above threshold .",
    "they should not therefore be taken as necessarily implying that the @xmath82 will bind with two protons .",
    "there is strong evidence for a cusp effect arising from the @xmath83 transitions .",
    "our analysis within a coupled - channel description suggests that , with the values of the @xmath54 scattering lengths used , the production of isospin - zero @xmath54 pairs dominates .",
    "though this is consistent with results extracted from data taken above the @xmath1 threshold  @xcite , there is clearly room for some refinement in the model . on the other hand , the structure of the @xmath4 invariant mass distribution of fig .",
    "[ ratio_pk ] in the 1437  mev/@xmath35 region suggests that there might be important coupling also between the @xmath4 and @xmath7 systems .",
    "it is evident that the interactions in the four - body @xmath31 final state are extremely complex .",
    "nevertheless , the energy dependence of the total cross section can be well described above the @xmath1 threshold by introducing the effects of the @xmath37 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 final state interaction with an effective scattering length of @xmath49  fm . this would , however , have to be increased to have any hope of fitting the lower energy data .",
    "further theoretical work is required to clarify the reaction mechanisms .",
