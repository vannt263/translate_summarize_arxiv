    "a large number of molecular solids made from organic molecules containing magnetic ions have come to be known as single - molecule magnets ( smm s ) , and their magnetization dynamics has been studied intensively for over a decade now  @xcite .",
    "the designation smm comes about because the intermolecular magnetic interactions are much weaker than the intramolecular ones , yet one sees hystersis @xcite , a phenomenon generally associated with ferromagnets in which the spins are strongly interacting .",
    "of special interest , and the subject of this paper , is the study of low - temperature quantum tunneling between the two lowest zeeman sublevels of one molecular spin ( ms ) , since , then , processes such as phonon induced excitation or relaxation do not come into play @xcite , and the dynamics is , a priori , purely quantum mechanical .",
    "the above conclusion is strongly reinforced by experiments in which the magnetization relaxes in the presence of a time - dependent magnetic field which is swept through the value where the two zeeman levels are degenerate  @xcite . at first sight , this constitutes a classic landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) process  , and the data appear to confirm this idea , especially in 8 .",
    "the strongest check comes from the fact that the transition probability depends on the sweep rate over two and a half orders of magnitude in agreement with the lzs formula .",
    "further , the tunneling amplitude extracted by fitting to this formula agrees with direct numerical diagonalization of the single ms hamiltonian .",
    "most importantly , the matrix element so deduced varies with a static _ transverse _ magnetic field in oscillatory fashion  , as required by the model hamiltonian  .",
    "it is , however , surprising that the lzs formula should be so well obeyed , since it is derived for isolated , noninteracting spins .",
    "the ms s in smm s interact with many other degrees of freedom , and anything in the environment that can distiguish between the two tunneling states of the system will tend to suppress quantum tunneling and act as a source of decoherence .",
    "phonons are an obvious such environment , but can be excluded by working at low enough temperatures .",
    "the remaining environment is that of the nuclear spins . these have been previously studied in connection with magnetization tunneling in small magnetic particles  , and in smm",
    "s  @xcite .",
    "in addition , one must also consider the other ms s .",
    "the general picture that emerges from refs .",
    "is that nuclear spins give rise to incoherent transitions and the other ms s spin give rise to an additional magnetic field that must be added on to the applied field in determining whether a given ms is at degeneracy or not .",
    "other authors have adopted this point of view and studied these systems via monte carlo simulations  .",
    "chapter 9 of ref .   contains a good discussion of these and related points .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to reexamine the decoherence from nuclear and molecular spins , especially the latter . in 8 ,",
    "the dipole field from other ms s is about ten times larger than that due to the nuclear spins , so a priori , they should be a significant source of decoherence .",
    "it may at first sight be puzzling that the ms s which form the  system \" , can also behave as an  environment \" .",
    "the situation is analogous to how the electron - electron interaction in metals contributes to the electrical resistivity . in a model in which the ms s",
    "are coupled to each other , but not to any other degrees of freedom , the _ many - body _ ( or many - spin ) wave function of the ms s evolves coherently , yet the off - diagonal elements of the _ one - body _",
    "( one - spin ) density matrix can still decohere , i.e. , decay with time . since the magnetization is a sum of one - spin operators ,",
    "such decay is relevant to its dynamics .",
    "whether the model is adequate is a quantitative question depending on whether the omitted degrees of freedom are stronger or weaker decoherers than the ones considered .",
    "thus , in metals at room temperature , phonon and impurity scattering are greater contributors to the resistivity than electron - electron scattering , and should not be omitted in a good model .",
    "the converse is true at very low temperatures in very pure samples ( less than @xmath0 in potassium , for example ) .",
    "the model we study is the following .",
    "each magnetic molecule is taken to have a total spin @xmath1 in its ground manifold , and to have two easy directions , @xmath2 , separated by a barrier , @xmath3 .",
    "it is assumed that other spin multiplets can be ignored at low temperatures , so that each molecule can be treated as a single spin of magntiude @xmath1 . in zero external field",
    ", an isolated ms can tunnel between the @xmath4 states .",
    "the corresponding energy splitting is denoted @xmath5 .    next , the ms s",
    "are coupled to the nuclear spins ( ns ) .",
    "two broadly different types of couplings may be distinguished .",
    "if the magnetic ions have nuclei with nonzero magnetic moments , the contact hyperfine interaction between an ion and its own nucleus must be considered .",
    "the corresponding energy scale is 110 mk .",
    "the second is the dipolar coupling between the ms s and other nuclear spins , with an energy scale @xmath6  mk for close by nuclei .",
    "( the suffixes ` d ' and ` n ' stand for ` dipole ' and ` nuclear ' , respectively . )",
    "we shall assume that @xmath7 , as is the case in 8 .",
    "in addition , different ms s are coupled via the dipole - dipole interaction , which is taken to have a scale @xmath8 for nearest neighbours .",
    "( the suffixes ` d ' and ` m ' stand for ` dipole ' and ` molecular ' , respectively .",
    ") there is clear separation of energy scales : @xmath9 .",
    "this is a good description of many smm s . in 8 , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath10  k , @xmath11  k , and @xmath12@xmath13  k. stray and dipolar magnetic fields along @xmath14 and @xmath15 are unimportant since they are not large enough to give any significant mixing of the @xmath16 states with the higher zeeman states , and they affect @xmath5 only weakly . along @xmath17 on the other hand , such fields are very important , since they move ms s off resonance . under these conditions , each ms may be replaced by a pseudospin with spin-1/2 with the @xmath18 states representing the @xmath4 states of the true spin .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we calculate the decoherence from nuclear and molecular spins in secs .",
    "[ mod1 ] and [ mod2 ] , respectively , pushing various details of the calculations to the appendices . in , we consider the two environments together . in",
    "we consider the implications of the decoherence for the lzs process .",
    "we find that although the tunneling is indeed incoherent , the net spin - flip probability in a single lzs sweep is remarkably insensitive to the details of the decoherence mechanism . in a simple model where the dipole field due to the other ms s is omitted",
    ", the probability turns out to be given exactly by kayanuma s formula for a spin coupled to an oscillator bath in the strong damping limit  . in the limit of high field sweep rate this formula agrees precisely with the lzs formula .",
    "this explains why the experiments appear to be in accord with the lzs scenario .",
    "we also consider a better approximation where the dipole field is included in a macroscopically averaged way .",
    "this approximation improves the agreement with the experiments by wernsdorfer et al .  .",
    "as our first model , we consider a single molecular spin interacting with the nuclear spins via the dipolar coupling .",
    "hyperfine and transferred hyperfine interactions are not explicitly included , although in the end they are unlikely to have qualitatively different effects , and only to lead to a modification of the parameter @xmath19 introduced below .",
    "we assume that all nuclear spins have spin 1/2 , and neglect the local magnetic field @xmath20 at the nuclear site .",
    "this is a good assumption if @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the nuclear magnetic moment .",
    "this is indeed so since @xmath23  t at 10 mk .",
    "the dipolar coupling between nuclear spins can be neglected for the same reason . with these assumptions ,",
    "our hamiltonian is _",
    "mn = ( _ 0x + _",
    "0z ) + _ i e_dn a^3 r^3_0i [ _ 0z_iz - 3_0z _ 0i _ i_0i ] .",

    "further , @xmath30 is the characteristic distance from the ms to the nearest ns .",
    "we expect @xmath31 1 - 2    for any smm .",
    "finally , we have included an energy bias @xmath32 between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 states of the ms , which could arise from an external magnetic field .",
    "the suffixes in @xmath35 stand for ` molecular ' and ` nuclear ' .",
    "we now suppose that at time @xmath36 the ms is in the state @xmath37 , and that every ns is in a completely disordered state described by the density matrix @xmath38 .",
    "again , this assumption is well justified at the temperatures at which experiments have been carried out so far . the quantity of interest is the probability , @xmath39 , that the ms will be in the state @xmath40 irrespective of the ns state .    even for this simple model , an exact calculation of @xmath39 is not possible ( but see below ) .",
    "we therefore turn to the approximate methods described in sec .",
    "d of ref .  .",
    "we can not assume that the damping is weak , or that the ns s are fast compared to the ms s .",
    "golden rule \" approach is still fruitful , however , as @xmath5 is the smallest energy scale in the problem . moreover , the validity of this approach can be self - consistently checked .",

    "we first create a set of sites on a nearly cubic lattice .",
    "that is , each site is offset from a perfect cubic lattice by a small random amount equal to @xmath281 times the lattice constant in each of the three cartesian directions .",
    "( the reason for adding the offsets was to avoid exact cancellations of the dipole field from an aligned shell of nearest neighbor spins . we do not believe that this step is essential , but it does not invalidate the calculation either . ) we",
    "next place a spin on each site with the orientation @xmath67 randomly chosen to be @xmath282 with equal probability , and choose a particular value of @xmath283 .",
    "next , at each site we select an energy bias @xmath90 by sampling a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath284 in units such that @xmath285 .",
    "( in 8 the ratio @xmath286 is @xmath287 .",

    "the dipole field @xmath96 at each site due to the central spin is computed using with @xmath85 also equal to @xmath290 .",
    "that is , we do not take @xmath291 and @xmath85 to be different . with these values of @xmath96 and @xmath90 , we can then find ( all energies are computed in units of @xmath5 ) _ i = _ i k_i,^2 = _ i^2+^2 .",
    "it is now possible to calculate the expression ( [ mis ] ) for @xmath106 for any @xmath53 and @xmath283 .",
    "the dependence on two time variables is inconvenient , however , so instead we calculate the lower and upper bounds with respect to @xmath53 , which are given by _",
