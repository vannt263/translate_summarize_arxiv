    "* for all non - negative integers @xmath22 , the functions @xmath276 are quasi - polynomials modulo 2 that are odd in @xmath277 and even in @xmath278 of degree @xmath279 .",
    "by the previous example , the base cases @xmath280 and @xmath261 are indeed even quasi - polynomials modulo 2 of degrees 0 and 1 , respectively . now consider @xmath228 satisfying @xmath281 and suppose that the proposition is true for all @xmath228 of lesser complexity .",
