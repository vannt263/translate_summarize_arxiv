    "the inclusion of the coulomb interaction in the description of the three - particle scattering is a challenging task in theoretical few - body nuclear physics . due to its long range",
    ", the coulomb potential @xmath0 does not satisfy the mathematical properties required for the formulation of the standard scattering theory .",
    "there is a number of suggestions how to overcome this difficulty ; most of them are based on the configuration - space framework@xcite and are limited to energies below three - body breakup threshold ( 3bbt ) , while the others@xcite have not matured yet into practical applications . up to now",
    "only few approaches led to the results above 3bbt .",
    "those are configuration - space calculations for proton - deuteron ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) elastic scattering using the kohn variational principle@xcite and the screening and renormalization approach in the framework of momentum - space integral equations;@xcite the latter method will be discussed in more details .",
    "very recently @xmath1-@xmath2 results above 3bbt were also obtained using modified faddeev equation in configuration space together with the dumping ( screening ) of particular coulomb contributions.@xcite",
    "our treatment of the coulomb interaction is based on the idea of screening and renormalization proposed in refs .   for the scattering of two charged particles .",
    "the standard scattering theory is formally applicable to the screened coulomb potential which , in the @xmath3-space representation , we choose as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the screening radius , and @xmath6 controls the smoothness of the screening . in 1974",
    "taylor@xcite suggested that even for the description of systems with the coulomb interaction the standard scattering theory may be useful , since in nature the coulomb potential is always screened .",
    "the study of the two - particle system with the screened coulomb interaction revealed that , as expected , the physical observables become insensitive to screening provided it takes place at sufficiently large distances @xmath5 and , in the @xmath7 limit , coincide with the corresponding quantities known from the analytical solution of the two - particle coulomb problem : though the on - shell screened coulomb transition matrix @xmath8 with energy @xmath9 and momenta @xmath10 diverges in the @xmath7 limit , after renormalization by ( an equally ) diverging phase factor @xmath11 it converges as a distribution to the well known proper coulomb amplitude @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 renormalization by @xmath14 in the @xmath7 limit relates also the screened and proper coulomb wave functions.@xcite the convergence of the scattering amplitude as a distribution corresponds to the physical conditions in a real experiment where the incoming beam is not a plane wave but a wave packet and the forward scattering can not be measured.@xcite this justifies the replacement ( [ eq : tc ] ) in practical calculations . we emphasize that the renormalization ( [ eq : tc ] ) relates only the scattering amplitudes ; its application to the off - shell transition matrices@xcite in unjustified .",
    "however , for the calculation of observables , only the renormalization of the on - shell transition matrix and wave function is needed .",
    "the screening and renormalization approach can be applied to more complicated systems.@xcite here we briefly recall the procedure which is described in details in refs .  .",
    "in the multichannel on - shell transition matrix @xmath15 between initial and final channel states @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , derived from nuclear plus screened coulomb potentials , one has to isolate the diverging screened coulomb contributions in the form of a two - body on - shell transition matrix and two - body wave function with known renormalization properties .",
    "this can be achieved using the two - potential formalism as long as in the initial / final states there are no more than two charged bodies ( clusters ) .",
    "this also enables to decompose @xmath15 into contributions with different range properties .",
    "the long - range part , the two - body on - shell transition matrix @xmath19 , derived from the screened coulomb potential of the form ( [ eq : wr ] ) between the centers of mass ( c.m . ) of the two charged bodies in the initial state , is present in the elastic scattering only .",
    "after renormalization by the diverging phase factor @xmath20 , this contribution converges towards its @xmath7 limit very slowly , and , in general , as a distribution only , but the result @xmath21 , the pure coulomb amplitude of two - body nature , is known analytically .",
    "the remaining part of the elastic scattering amplitude as well as the amplitudes for transfer and breakup are short - range operators that are externally distorted by coulomb . due to their short - range nature , convergence with @xmath5 after the renormalization by the corresponding phase factors is fast and , therefore , the @xmath7 limit can be calculated numerically with high accuracy at finite @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the physical scattering amplitudes are obtained after renormalization of @xmath15 in the @xmath7 limit as @xmath22              |i \\rangle z_{ir}^{-\\frac12 } \\}.",
    "\\end{split}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    one can use standard scattering theory to calculate the multichannel transition operators @xmath23 at finite screening radius @xmath5 and make sure that @xmath5 is large enough for the convergence of the results .",
    "we solve alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) equations for three- and four - particle scattering@xcite which are equivalent to faddeev and yakubovsky equations.@xcite we employ momentum - space partial - wave representation as described in detail in refs .   for three- and four - nucleon scattering without the coulomb force .",
    "however , the screened coulomb interaction , due to its longer range , compared to the nuclear interaction , brings additional difficulties : quasisingular nature of the potential and slow convergence of the partial - wave expansion .",
    "the right choice of the parameter @xmath6 controlling the smoothness of the screening ( [ eq : wr ] ) is essential in resolving those difficulties as we demonstrated in ref .  .",
    "we work with a sharper screening than the yukawa screening @xmath24 of refs .  .",
    "we want to ensure that the screened coulomb potential @xmath25 approximates well the true coulomb one @xmath0 for distances @xmath26 and simultaneously vanishes rapidly for @xmath27 , providing a comparatively fast convergence of the partial - wave expansion and less pronounced quasisingularities .",
    "in contrast , the sharp cutoff @xmath28 yields an unpleasant oscillatory behavior in the momentum - space representation , leading to convergence problems . depending on the reaction we found the values @xmath29 to provide a sufficiently smooth , but at the same time a sufficiently rapid screening around @xmath30 . in any case",
    "the screening radius @xmath5 needed for convergence in eq .",
    "is considerably larger than the range of the nuclear interaction and , therefore , the calculation of @xmath23 requires the inclusion of partial waves with angular momentum much higher than needed for the nuclear potential alone .",
    "this problem can be solved in an efficient and reliable way either by using the perturbative approach for high two - particle partial waves , developed in ref .  , or even without it as discussed in ref .  .",
    "the internal criterion for the reliability of our method is the convergence of the observables with screening radius @xmath5 used to calculate the coulomb - distorted short - range part of the amplitudes in eq .  .",
    "numerous examples for three - nucleon hadronic and electromagnetic reactions , @xmath31-@xmath2 and @xmath32 scattering can be found in refs .  .",
    "in most cases the convergence is impressively fast ; the screening radius @xmath33 to 30 fm is sufficient .",
    "the exceptions requiring larger screening radii are the observables at very low energies and the breakup differential cross section in kinematical situations characterized by very low relative energy @xmath34 between the two charged particles , e.g. , @xmath1-@xmath2 breakup or photodisintegration of @xmath35 close to the @xmath36 final - state interaction ( @xmath36-fsi ) regime.@xcite in there , the coulomb repulsion is responsible for decreasing the cross section , converting the fsi peak obtained in the absence of coulomb into a minimum with zero cross section at @xmath37 .",
    "such a behavior is seen in the experimental data as well.@xcite the slow convergence under those conditions is not surprising , since the renormalization factor itself as well as the coulomb parameter become ill - defined , indicating that the screening and renormalization procedure can not be applied at @xmath37 .",
    "therefore an extrapolation has to be used to calculate the observables at @xmath37 , which works pretty well since the observables vary smoothly with @xmath34 .",
    "it has been claimed@xcite that the method of screening and renormalization ceases to work even for @xmath36 scattering below 0.1 mev c.m . energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] we prove that this is not so by getting well converged results at 0.01 mev .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] also shows that the screening radius indeed has to be increased with decreased energy and at some point would become too large for reliable numerical calculation .",
    "phase shifts of @xmath36 scattering at 0.01 , 0.1 and 1 mev c.m",
    "results obtained using screening and renormalization method are shown as function of the screening radius @xmath5 ( solid curves ) .",
    "dashed lines are the exact results .",
    "[ fig : pp ] ]",
    "we have discussed how the coulomb interaction between the charged particles can be included into the description of few - body reactions using the old idea of screening and renormalization.@xcite the calculations are done in the framework of ags integral equations@xcite in momentum - space . the screening and renormalization approach has already been used for @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering@xcite but with limited success : those calculations were based on quasiparticle equations with rank-1 separable potentials and , in addition , the screened coulomb transition matrix was approximated by the screened coulomb potential ; none of these approximations is used by us .",
    "it is the new screening function that allows us to avoid these approximations and obtain fully converged results .",
    "furthermore , the results for @xmath1-@xmath2 elastic scattering obtained by the present technique were compared@xcite with those of ref",
    ".   obtained from the variational solution of the three - nucleon schrdinger equation in configuration space with the inclusion of an _ unscreened _ coulomb potential between the protons and imposing the proper coulomb boundary conditions explicitly .",
    "good agreement over a wide energy range was found indicating that both techniques for including the coulomb interaction are reliable . at very low energies",
    "the coordinate - space treatments remain favored since there the method of screening and renormalization converges slowly and therefore becomes technically too demanding , but at higher energies and for three - body breakup reactions it is more efficient .",
    "a detailed comparison still has to be done but it seems that there is a reasonable agreement between momentum- and coordinate - space results also in the case of @xmath1-@xmath2 breakup@xcite and @xmath1-@xmath35 scattering.@xcite    the present method was used to study @xmath1-@xmath2 elastic scattering and breakup in refs .",
    ", @xmath1-@xmath2 radiative capture in refs .   and photo- and electrodisintegration of @xmath35 in refs .",
    "furthermore , it was applied to the nuclear reactions dominated by three - body degrees of freedom , i.e. , deuteron scattering on stable nuclei or proton scattering on one - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "examples are low - energy @xmath31-@xmath2 elastic scattering and breakup@xcite and @xmath38 and @xmath39 elastic , transfer , and breakup reactions@xcite where also the accuracy of traditional approximate nuclear reaction approaches like continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) method , glauber , and distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) could be tested .",
    "finally , all elastic and transfer four - nucleon reactions below three - body breakup threshold , i.e. , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , have been studied in refs .  .",
    "the conclusion is that the coulomb effect is important at low energies for all kinematic regimes , but gets confined to the forward direction in elastic scattering at higher energies . in @xmath1-@xmath2 breakup and in three - body e.m .",
    "disintegration of @xmath35 the coulomb effect is extremely important in kinematical regimes close to @xmath36-fsi .",
    "there the @xmath36 repulsion converts the @xmath36-fsi peak obtained in the absence of coulomb into a minimum with zero cross section.@xcite this significant change of the cross section behavior has important consequences in nearby configurations where one may observe instead an increase of the cross section due to coulomb.@xcite however , some of the long - standing discrepancies between experiment and theory like the space star anomaly in @xmath1-@xmath2 breakup are not resolved by the inclusion of the coulomb interaction.@xcite a very strong coulomb effect is found in @xmath31-@xmath2 breakup where the shift of @xmath45 @xmath46-wave resonance position leads to the corresponding shifts of the differential cross section peaks.@xcite",
