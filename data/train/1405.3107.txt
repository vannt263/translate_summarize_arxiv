    "simple expressions for these ratios are commonly used , but while the standard limiting formula for the first ratio has been derived long ago ( e.g. , schlickeiser 2002 ) , there seems to be no derivation ( to our best knowledge ) of a similar expression for the p / e energy density ratio .",
    "due to the basic interest in the latter ratio ( e.g. , in the estimation of the proton energy density from the more readily measured electron energy density ) , it is useful to have a convenient expression also for this ratio .",
    "this can be easily obtained when the total number of energetic protons very closely equals that of energetic electrons .",
