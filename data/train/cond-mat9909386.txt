    "recently , small metallic grains , with sizes down to 5 - 10 nm , became available for experimental study@xcite .",
    "superconducting transition in such grains manifests itself through the _ parity effect _ , namely dependence of electronic properties of the grain on whether the number of electrons in the grain is even or odd .",
    "tinkham , hergenrother and lu@xcite showed that in a single - electron tunneling ( set ) transistor@xcite with a superconducting island , conductance channels open below a certain temperature @xmath9 only for an odd number of electrons on the superconducting grain , whereas above @xmath10 they open symmetrically at odd and even number of electrons .",
    "this means that energy of the state with odd number of electrons shifts up by an amount @xmath6@xcite , so called _ parity effect parameter _",
    "@xmath11    several authors @xcite developed theories attempting to calculate properties of superconducting state of the grain with discrete electronic levels .",
    "it was assumed that the level degeneracy is totally removed , and the only parameter distinguishing the small grain from the bulk sample is the ratio of the average level spacing @xmath12 in a sample to the bulk superconducting gap @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "there are two main motivations for studying the effect of degeneracy .",
    "first , small superconducting particles can in principle be prepared in a perfect symmetric shape @xcite in which case the mesoscopic superconductivity parity effect will show novel features due to level degeneracy .",
    "the second and more important is the necessity of distinguishing between the level spacing due to size effect @xmath15 , and the average level spacing @xmath16 which is much smaller than @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is total number of conduction electrons in metallic grain ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath19 is of the order @xmath20 , which is very large for a typical mesoscopic particle of size @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "the realistic energy structure of small grain is therefore not equidistant spectrum with level spacing @xmath17 , adopted in most papers on mesoscopic superconductivity , but rather peaks in the density of states with characteristic distance @xmath17 accompanied by finer structure with smaller energy separation @xmath23 . to understand which effects such finer structure may have on superconductivity in mesoscopic particles , we adopt a model of @xmath17-spaced levels with the degeneracy @xmath0 ( in the rest of our work we drop the index and denote level spacing by @xmath12 ) .",
    "calculation of superconducting condensation energy @xcite shows that energy binding per particle is _ not _",
    "@xmath13 , as may be expected from a naive picture of particle binding resulting in energy decrease @xmath24 , but rather of order @xmath25 .",
    "adding extra two electrons to superconductor decreases energy by @xmath24 but at the same time provides a ( small ) shift of the chemical potential in such a way that the net energy change per particle is only @xmath26 .",
    "a realistic calculation of the parity effect must treat system of interacting electrons self - consistently as it is done in the standard bcs theory of bulk superconductors @xcite .",
    "in the theory of superconductivity of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer@xcite , the coupling hamiltonian is introduced in the form @xmath27 where operator @xmath28 creates an electron in a state with momentum @xmath29 and spin projection @xmath30 . @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath31 states are selected in expense of all other states ( such as @xmath29 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 ) , because only these two time - reversed states lead to singularity which results in cooper instability identified by logarithmic divergence of the scattering amplitude @xmath34 as @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "pairing of non - time reversed states can be treated perturbatively , or can be included as a renormalization in the fermi liquid picture .",
    "assume that the single electron states @xmath36 in metal are decomposed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are plane waves .",
    "we are going to denote the time reversal state corresponding to @xmath36 by @xmath39 which is given by the complex conjugate of @xmath36 .",
    "in general @xmath36 and @xmath39 are different states .",
    "let us introduce the operators @xmath40 these are fermi operators since @xmath28 and @xmath41 obey the fermi statistics .",
    "let us consider the sum @xmath42 , which can be represented as @xmath43 if we form an interaction hamiltonian using @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath46 , @xmath47 contains a singular part which is identical to eq .",
    "[ bcs ] because of the identities @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( for real @xmath36 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 turn out to be the same state and if there is no further degeneracy due to other symmetries @xmath52 reduces to the  toy model \" of superconductivity which has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the interaction hamiltonian in a grain can in general be written as @xmath53 we will further split index @xmath54 into @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the energy levels and @xmath57 denotes the degenerate states for this level .",
    "the only symmetry expected to hold in an irregularly shaped ultrasmall grain is the time - reversal symmetry which may lead to double degeneracy for the energy levels , for example current carrying states . on the other hand , for certain energy spectra and more generally for lattice symmetries",
    ", energy levels are strongly degenerate near the fermi energy . for very small particles ,",
    "splitting due to weak disorder or asymmetry is much smaller than the splitting due to size effect . in this case",
    "the system can be modeled as almost degenerate with two dimensionless parameters governing superconducting transition , namely @xmath14 , the ratio of level spacing to bulk gap , and @xmath0 , the degeneracy of split levels .",
    "in our study , for simplicity , we assume all energy levels are @xmath0-fold degenerate and levels are equally spaced with level spacing being equal to @xmath12 . we start with the following pair interaction hamiltonian which is properly modified to take the degeneracy into account @xmath58 where second sum is over the set of levels @xmath59 which are lying within the @xmath60 shell centered at fermi level , that is @xmath61 with @xmath62 being equal to integer part of @xmath63 , and @xmath64 runs over all the degenerate states for a given energy level . here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are time reversed states for which the matrix elements are much larger then all others@xcite .",
    "for example , for a grain where eigenstates are labeled by crystal momentum @xmath29 , the two states are @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note that there is another similar but different pair formed by @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in usual bcs problem , since there is a summation over @xmath29 , both pairs are properly taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , when we sum over energy levels rather than individual states we must be careful in including both pairs .",
    "however , the model without double degeneracy can still be used to describe the superconductivity in systems with real wave functions @xcite .",
    "next , we introduce the boson operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 it is easy to verify that @xmath73 and @xmath74 satisfy  boson \" commutation relations @xmath75= \\delta_{jj'}\\delta_{\\alpha\\alpha'}(1 - 2n_{j\\alpha}).\\ ] ] presence of the number operator on the right hand side is direct consequence of the pauli principle . with these new operators ,",
    "the pairing hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath76 this hamiltonian can be split into two parts as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and the sum in @xmath79 is over non - interacting particles while in @xmath80 both of the sums are over interacting particles .",
    "interacting particles are those which occupy levels inside @xmath60 shell about the fermi level except the singly occupied level . since the interaction is only between pairs , this singly occupied level is removed form the set @xmath59 .",
    "this is the so called  blocking effect \" . as @xmath79 and @xmath80 commute ,",
    "eigenstates of @xmath81 are product of eigenstates of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and eigenvalues of @xmath81 are sums of corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath79 simply represents non - interacting particles in a potential , thus determining the ground state energy of @xmath81 reduces to solving for @xmath80 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath80 has been studied with exact diagonalization methods by mastellone , falci , and fazio ( mff)@xcite , and by berger and halperin ( bh ) @xcite for the non - degenerate case and with relatively small number of levels taken into account ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "however , there exists an exact solution for @xmath80 due to richardson and sherman ( rs ) @xcite .",
    "this long forgotten exact solution has been re - introduced to condensed matter community by braun and von delft @xcite in the context of ultrasmall superconducting grains .",
    "here , we briefly review the richardson - sherman solution .",
    "first , @xmath80 is treated without the pauli exclusion principle , that is hardcore bose particles are treated as normal bose particles .",
    "after diagonalizing that hamiltonian for normal bosons by a canonical transformation , the following boson wave function is obtained @xmath83 where @xmath18 is the total number of bosons , and in @xmath84 , @xmath85 means summing over @xmath86 permutations of indices @xmath87 , and the corresponding energy is @xmath88 next , pauli exclusion principle is imposed with the condition that @xmath89 if any two @xmath90 are not distinct .",
    "this restriction is introduced by writing the wave function as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is equal to 1 if all @xmath90 s are distinct , and is equal to 0 otherwise .",
    "then , after some calculation an effective schrdinger equation for @xmath93 is obtained @xcite @xmath94 for a multiply degenerate single level , ground state energy is given by @xmath95 where @xmath0 is the pair degeneracy of the level .",
    "next we focus on degenerate levels in the @xmath60 interacting shell leading to a set of coupled equations for @xmath18 pairs and @xmath96 levels which are @xmath0-fold degenerate : @xmath97 where @xmath98 the ground state wave function is given by ( [ wave ] ) up to a normalization constant and the corresponding ground state energy is calculated from ( [ groundenergy ] ) .    at some values of @xmath99 , depending upon the state under consideration , eq .

    "this form of @xmath100 preserves the reality of the ground state energy @xmath105 ( eq . [ groundenergy ] ) , and also the reality of the ground state wave function @xcite . at a singular point ,",

    "however it is not possible to generalize that method to degenerate case . in this case roots",
    "are complex for all values of @xmath104 ( if @xmath18 is odd , one root remains real for all @xmath104 ) .",
    "[ roots ] shows typical behavior of roots for the double degenerate case ( see richardson @xcite for the behavior of roots in the non - degenerate case ) .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath110 for a given number of electrons @xmath111 allows us to calculate the parity effect parameters @xmath112 where @xmath113 . here by @xmath111 we mean the number of electrons in the thin shell around the fermi level participating the pairing interaction .",
    "we assume that the shell is composed of @xmath62 levels below and above the fermi energy .",
    "note that with this definition @xmath110 can take @xmath114 different values and that is why @xmath115 index running from 1 to @xmath114 exhausts all possible values of the right hand side .    in principle , to study the effect of finite energy level spacing",

    "the motivation from physical point of view is the expectation that number parity effect , if it exists , should mainly be a function of dimensionless parameter @xmath14 .",
    "our numerical results support our alternative approach , as well . given a @xmath14 ratio ,",
    "if we repeat our calculations for increasing values of @xmath62 , we observe that @xmath120 ratios do not change very much .",
    "exact diagonalization approach of mff @xcite and bh @xcite for the non - degenerate case showed that both ground state properties and excitation gap are parity dependent and functions of the ratio of level spacing to the bcs gap , @xmath14 .",
    "however systems addressed by mff and bh are limited to relatively small number of levels , @xmath62 , taken around fermi level .",

    "[ non - deg ] we reproduce the dependence of parity gap parameter , @xmath122 , upon level spacing @xmath12 .",
    "here our aim in reproducing these results , which are obtained by using much larger values of @xmath62 ( such as @xmath123 ) for the non - degenerate case , is to compare them with those of mff and bh .",
    "when @xmath62 increases we obtain a different behavior of @xmath124 which was not observed by mff and bh . as the number of levels @xmath62 increases , instead of a monotonic behavior , @xmath125 curve exhibits a minimum at @xmath126 , which can not be observed with smaller @xmath62 values ( see fig . [ non - deg](a ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the dependence of @xmath127 upon @xmath12 we observe the same behavior as mff and bh , that is a minimum at @xmath128 ( see fig .",

    "von delft and braun @xcite show similar results for @xmath127 in the non - degenerate case in order to compare rs exact solution to earlier approaches to the problem of mesoscopic superconductivity .",

    "[ deg ] we present the results for doubly degenerate case ( @xmath130 ) which show that parity effect is still there .",

    "some important conclusions can be drawn by comparing fig .",
    "[ non - deg ] and fig .",
    "[ deg ] , immediately .",
    "firstly , @xmath122s repeat themselves with a periodicity of two for the non - degenerate case , whereas they have a periodicity of four for the doubly degenerate case , that is the parity effect parameters repeat themselves with a period of @xmath114 .",
    "secondly , one can immediately observe that there is a remarkable difference between the ratios of two different @xmath122s for the degenerate and non - degenerate case .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ non - deg](a ) and ( b ) ) at a fixed @xmath14 value ( @xmath133 ) , is about 5 , while @xmath134 for doubly degenerate case ( fig .",
    "[ deg](b ) and ( c ) ) is about 1.5 for the same value of @xmath14 .",
    "we will come to a rough estimation of these values in a short while .",
    "as it has been mentioned earlier , for certain energy spectra and more generally for lattice symmetries , energy levels are degenerate near the fermi energy . in case of a d - fold degenerate single level with our notation @xmath135 , and the ground state energy ( [ single ] ) measured from the fermi level",

    "parity effect appears in the second term on the right hand side . depending upon whether @xmath111 is odd or even ,",
    "the factor in front of @xmath18 becomes @xmath0 or @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "this is nothing but the blocking effect of the single electron .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath0 becomes larger , this effect will become less important . by substituting eq .",
    "[ onelevel ] into eq .",
    "[ parity ] we obtain @xmath139 where @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) stands for @xmath115 odd ( even ) in eq . [ parity ] . note that we consider a fixed chemical potential @xmath142 in derivation of ( [ ratio ] )",
    ". therefore this ratio ( [ ratio ] ) is valid for a parity effect parameter @xmath122 for which all ground state energies , @xmath110 , used in eq .",

    "moreover , for @xmath145 , we find @xmath146 which is even closer to the ratio above . for 4-fold degeneracy , where @xmath147 , we obtain similar ratios .",
    "for example @xmath148 at @xmath149 , and @xmath150 at @xmath151 .",
    "these results are not unexpected since as @xmath14 increases , contribution of electrons at the fermi level to the ground state energy becomes dominant which lets single level result become a better approximation . on the other hand",
    "when @xmath142 shifts , eq .",
    "[ ratio ] is not valid anymore and the ratio @xmath152 becomes very different from 1 .",
    "for example , @xmath153 for non - degenerate case and @xmath154 for doubly degenerate case at @xmath145 .",
    "we supplement the investigation of a parity effect  from above \" ( from macroscopic sizes down to mesoscopic sizes ) by an investigation  from below \" , that is , starting from small clusters of atoms coupled at sites by some interaction energy @xcite . unlike eq .",

    "this above hamiltonian will reduce to a bcs hamiltonian ( [ bcs ] ) in the limit of large number of sites and small @xmath8 with the difference that the interaction ( [ hubbard ] ) is a non - retarding one , and the interaction shell ( the cut - off energy ) at fermi energy is increased up to the value of the order of fermi energy itself . in the absence of interactions for energy levels of cubic cluster , we find @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are triply degenerate , and hence level spacing @xmath12 is given by @xmath163 .",
    "an exact solution of hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) in a cubic cluster allowing for maximum of 16 electrons has been studied earlier @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix corresponding to eq .",
    "[ hubbard ] has a maximum dimension of @xmath164 after reduction of the size with symmetry consideration , and ground state eigenvalue is calculated by an exact diagonalization method ( of non - lanczos type)@xcite .",

    ", we change the bulk energy gap @xmath13 which we calculate by using bcs gap equation . for @xmath171 ,",
    "approximating the density of states by @xmath172 , we see that the coupling parameter @xmath173 changes between 0.08 and 0.83 . therefore , at least for small @xmath174 values , we are in the weak - coupling bcs regime where approximate solution of the gap equation can be written as @xmath175 .",
    "non - zero parity effect parameter , @xmath6 , is directly seen from the energy versus electron number plot ( see fig .",
    "we observe that @xmath110 is not a monotonic function of @xmath111 .",
    "the ground state energy exhibits dips for even number of electrons .",
    "this is an unambiguous indication of the parity effect , which is a direct manifestation of cooper pairing .",
    "the inset in fig .",

    "we find , on contrary , that @xmath178 at @xmath179 and hence conclude that repulsive hubbard model does not lead to superconductivity .",
    "nevertheless in principle this result does not exclude the possibility of superconductivity in a larger system with @xmath179 .",
    "presence of parity effect for negative-@xmath8 hubbard hamiltonian is important since it shows that dependence of superconducting properties on whether there are even or odd number of electrons is not specific to bcs hamiltonian .",

    "figure [ fig5 ] shows three different parity effect parameters , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 as a function of level spacing @xmath192 .",
    "it is remarkable that curves are very similar to those obtained for bcs hamiltonian .",
    "again , due to degeneracy , @xmath189 which involves the jump @xmath193 exhibit a slightly different behavior in comparison to @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied the effect of degeneracy of discrete energy levels on superconducting properties of a small metallic grain .",
    "we observe that parity effect parameter , which is a measure of the dependence of energy on whether the number of electrons in the grain is even or odd , exhibits a behavior similar to the non - degenerate case for small @xmath0 .",
    "we reproduced the behavior of parity effect parameter in the well studied non - degenerate case in order to compare our exact results with previous work . in that case the parity effect parameter exhibits a minimum instead of a monotonic behavior . for",
    "d - fold degenerate states it turns out that there are 2d different parity gaps and furthermore both approximate analytic solutions and exact numerical results suggest that ratio of two successive parity effect parameters is nearly @xmath7",
    ". therefore careful measurements of parity parameters can be used to determine the degeneracy of energy levels . with increasing degeneracy ,",
    "the pairing effect is suppressed .",
    "although there is no direct evidence for existence of set transistors with a metallic grain of perfect crystal structure , observation of perfect geometries in small grains prepared by vapor condensation technique opens a possibility for having highly symmetric structures . as we discussed above smallness of the average level spacing in comparison to the level spacing due to finite size effect leads to a nearly degenerate energy spectrum .",
    "convergence of the ratio of two successive parity effect parameters to @xmath7 as the level spacing increases , can be used to detect the degeneracy .",
    "we also show that parity effect is not specific to bcs hamiltonian by solving negative-@xmath8 hubbard model for a small atomic cluster exactly .",
    "we can say that this is the most rigorous way to treat the problem since it does not involve any approximation like pairing assumption .",
    "our results clearly show that parity effect exists and hence we conclude that it is model independent and a general property of small fermi systems with attractive interaction .",
    "furthermore , @xmath120 curves exhibit a behavior which is very similar to bcs case .",

    "<S> recently , it has been possible to construct single - electron transistors to study electronic properties , including superconductivity , in metallic grains of nanometer size . among several theoretical results </S>",
    "<S> are suppression of superconductivity with decreasing grain size and parity effect , i.e. dependence on the parity of the number of electrons on the grain . </S>",
    "<S> we study how these results are affected by degeneracy of energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the time - reversal symmetry , for certain energy spectra and more generally for lattice symmetries , energy levels are strongly degenerate near the fermi energy . for a parabolic dispersion , </S>",
    "<S> degeneracy @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath1 while the typical distance between the levels is of the order of @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fermi wave vector and energy , respectively , and @xmath5 is the particle size . </S>",
    "<S> first , using an exact solution method for bcs hamiltonian with finite number of energy levels , for the well studied non - degenerate case we find a new feature . in that case , </S>",
    "<S> parity effect exhibits a minimum instead of a monotonic behavior . for @xmath0-fold degenerate states </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ratio of two successive parity effect parameters @xmath6 is nearly @xmath7 . our numerical solutions for the exact ground state energy of negative @xmath8 hubbard model on a cubic cluster also give very similar results . </S>",
    "<S> hence we conclude that parity effect is a general property of small fermi systems with attractive interaction , and it is closely related to degeneracy of energy levels . </S>"
