    "@xmath24 is the fluctuating potential averaged over the fast gyro - motion .",
    "note that the fluctuating electrostatic potential is associated with the fluctuating distribution function through the poisson equation , therefore , the vlasov - poisson system is a nonlinear complex system .",

    "we shall make four basic assumptions for the plasma turbulence as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the turbulence is stationary and homogeneous .",
    "\\(2 ) the characteristic scale length of the turbulent fluctuation , @xmath32 , is much smaller than the characteristic scale length of the macroscopic thermodynamic variables ( such as the averaged density and pressure ) , @xmath33 ; @xmath34 .",
    "the characteristic time scale of the turbulence , @xmath35 , is much shorter than the characteristic time scale of the macroscopic observables , @xmath36 . in detail",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath37 , and by assuming that @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 ( here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the fluctuating part and the average part of distribution function , respectively ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the ensemble - averaged distribution function that determines the entropy of the system can be found by taken the time - average on the time scale longer than @xmath35 but shorter than @xmath36 , with @xmath1 the phase - space point fixed .",
    "\\(4 ) the local entropy production rate is positive when the ensemble - averaged distribution is inhomogeneous .",
    "since there is no present experimental observations inconsistent with this statement , it may be raised as a principle ; hereafter , it may be referred to as the entropy principle , which can be taken as an extension of the second law of thermodynamics to a nonlinear turbulent system .",
    "assumption ( 3 ) indicates that the ensemble - averaged distribution function @xmath42 can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is used to emphasize that it is a `` eulerian '' integral ; @xmath1 in the kernel should be understood as a constant .",
    "clearly , one has @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . using eq .",

    "we point out that dropping this @xmath57 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp0 ] ) is consistent with assumption ( 2 ) and assumption ( 1 ) .",
    "the reason is as follows .    comparing this term with the diffusion term , one has @xmath58 where assumption ( 2 ) on the scale separation was used , therefore , the @xmath57 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp0 ] ) shall be dropped .    to proceed , we prove the symmetry relation of the phase - space diffusion tensor .",

    "the production rate of the entropy density @xmath84 is given by a quadratic form , @xmath85 with the inhomogeneity of the averaged distribution denoted by @xmath86 .",

    "average ( black points , @xmath1 fixed ) , and the @xmath94 ( ensemble ) average ( open circles , @xmath31 fixed ) .",
    "for a stochastic system , the trajectory may be similar to the orbit of a brownian particle , and the open circles should be randomly distributed along the vertical line .",

    "can be used to describe the nonlinear turbulent dissipation .",
    "although the quasilinear transport theory @xcite can also gives a fokker - planck equation with a symmetric kinetic diffusion tensor obtained by integrating along the unperturbed orbit , it is based on the perturbation theory ; therefore , the quasilinear theory is not applicable in the nonlinear turbulence saturation stage .",
    "note that the diffusion tensor , eq .",
    "( [ eq : d0 ] or [ eq : d1 ] ) , used in the fokker - planck equation derived here [ eq . ( [ eq : fp ] ) ] , is obtained by integrating along the full orbit ; therefore , it does not depend on the perturbation method and applies in the nonlinear regime .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the kinetic diffusion coefficient defined here agrees with the previous results in the limits of the random - walk model and the quasilinear transport model .",

    "( [ eq : fp ] ) , one can find the particle flux and the heat flux .",
    "the detailed derivation is similar to refs . , and",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .",
    "@xmath100    with @xmath101 and @xmath102 the particle flux and heat flux , respectively ; @xmath103 the equilibrium pressure ; @xmath104 the mean electric field .",
    "the transport matrix is given by @xmath105 which clearly satisfies onsager s reciprocal relation @xcite , @xmath106    the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - e ] ) is related to the celebrated stokes - einstein relation @xcite .",
    "it is due to the kinetic diffusion coefficient @xmath107 which reflects a cross - correlation induced by the mean electric field .",
    "this term indicates that a perpendicular mean electric field in a turbulent magnetized plasma should drive a perpendicular particle flux .",
    "note that this assertion does not depend on the details of the turbulence .",
    "the point is that @xmath108 , with @xmath109 and @xmath110 the fluctuations of particle kinetic energy and position , respectively .",

    "in summary , we have shown a first - principle derivation of the fokker - planck equation with a symmetric diffusion tensor from the nonlinear vlasov equation , by introducing 4 physical assumptions .",
    "assumption ( 1 ) restricts our discussion within the scope of stationary - homogeneous turbulence , as is widely adopted in fluid turbulence @xcite and plasma turbulence @xcite .",
    "assumption ( 2 ) is essentially the usual transport ansatz @xcite based on which a local transport theory is established due to the separation of scales .",
    "assumption ( 3 ) states that the ensemble average , whose classical definition makes it difficult to tract mathematically , can be evaluated by taking the time - average , which is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics ; we have discussed the equivalence of the @xmath79 average and the @xmath94 ( ensemble ) average based on the g - path mapping [ eq . ( [ eq : g - path - mapping ] ) ] shown in fig .",
    "1 and the specific discrete form of the @xmath94 average in eq . ( [ eq : z - avf ] ) ; note that in usual statistical mechanics @xcite the @xmath79 average is asserted to be equivalent to the ensemble ( @xmath94 ) average by introducing the ergodicity hypothesis , however , there is not a mathematically tractable form of the @xmath94 average given out .",
    "assumption ( 4 ) is the most important physical point of the deduction , which demonstrates that the fokker - planck equation is a natural result of the nonlinear vlasov equation in view of the entropy principle . as an application of the present theory ,",
    "we have shown that the onsager symmetry relation and the general stokes - einstein relation hold for a magnetic confinement plasma in a general stationary - homogeneous nonlinear turbulence ; in particular , a perpendicular mean electric filed can drive a perpendicular particle flux through the stokes - einstein relation , independent of the details of the assumed stationary - homogeneous turbulence , be it electrostatic or electromagnetic , ion - temperature - gradient driven or electron - temperature - gradient driven .",
    "further discussions on the stokes - einstein relation and the perpendicular electric field shall be left for future publications .",
    "to end this paper , we point out that the large - scale massive computer gyro - kinetic vlasov - poisson simulation has become one of the most powerful tools in investigating the nonlinear turbulence in plasmas , these tools include the particle - in - cell scheme @xcite and the semi - lagrangian continuum scheme @xcite .",
    "the transport fluxes , such as the particle flux and the heat flux , can be found from the simulation data by computing the moments of numerical distribution function ; however , the full transport matrix including the onsager relation and the stokes - einstein relation predicted by the conventional transport theory based on various reduced models of turbulence @xcite , can hardly be obtained from these simulation data .",
    "clearly , there is a serious lack of bridge between the nonlinear turbulence simulation and the transport theory .",
    "dupree has introduced the renormalization method in deriving a fokker - planck equation to describe the slow - evolution of the averaged distribution function @xcite .",
    "detailed discussions relating dupree s perturbation theory to the direct - interaction - approximation method can be found in chap . 8.11 and chap .",
    "9.1 of ref . ;",
    "briefly , this method is based on `` a set of equations for the two - point two - time correlation function '' `` that is beyond any possibilities of solution , be it analytical or numerical '' .",
    "the present work may suggest a step toward solving this outstanding problem in understanding the nonlinear turbulent transport , since all the macroscopic transport properties , such as the onsager relation and the stokes - einstein relation , are represented by the kinetic diffusion tensor , @xmath112 , which can be evaluated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : d0 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : d1 ] ) ; the ensemble average in these equations can be carried out in a straightforward way in nonlinear turbulence simulation , which only involves evaluating a 2-dimensional integral , a numerically tractable problem .",
    "the key point is that the previous two - point ( @xmath1 in phase space ) two - time correlation problem is reduced here to a one - point ( @xmath1 ) two - time correlation problem , which is accomplished by introducing the g - path mapping [ eq . ( [ eq : g - path - mapping ] ) ] .",
    "the method proposed here may also be useful in studying other fluctuating systems in statistical physics , turbulence , biologies , and financial system ."
