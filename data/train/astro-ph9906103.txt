    "in current models of galaxy formation the sfr of the universe is tightly related to the amount of cold and hot gas ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) contained in the dark matter ( dm ) halos where the galaxies are located . as a consequence",
    ", we expect the history of the sfr to be related to the x - ray properties of groups and clusters of galaxies , since these host most of the hot baryons emitting by thermal bremsstrahlung luminosities @xmath7 erg / s .",
    "in particular , the process of ster formation is expected to affect the x - ray properties of _ small _ galactic systems , since the `` stellar '' temperature @xmath8 kev ( @xmath9 being the supernova energy ) which measures the thermal energy provided by the supernovae ( sn ) is close to the virial temperature @xmath10 of small galaxy groups ( dm masses @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , in x - rays the connection with the sfr should show up mainly at faint luminosities .",
    "since the behaviour of the cosmic sfr at @xmath12 is still plagued by observational uncertainties in the o - ir bands , we explore here the above connection with the x - ray data , and show that such observations are within the reach of forthcoming x - ray observatories like axaf .",
    "these observations can discriminate between a declining sfr for @xmath12 ( as initially proposed ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) and a flat sfr for @xmath12 ( as indicated by recent observations ; see , e.g. , pettini 1997 ; meurer et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the result may have relevant implications for all sides of the current theories of galaxy formation , including the cosmogony of dm halos .",
    "in fact in these theories the sfr is strongly coupled to the dynamical history of the dm halos , whose hierarchical growth is thought to proceed through merging and accretion events .",
    "the baryonic processes inside dynamically evolving dm halos are usually treated using semi - analytic models ( sam ) in the framework of hierarchical clustering ( for a comprehensive account see somerville & primack 1998 ) . according to the sams ,",
    "the baryons gravitationally bound to a dm halo are assumed to be exchanged among three phases : the _ cold _ phase produced by radiative cooling ; the resulting _ condensed _ phase into stars ; the _ hot _ phase constituted by gas preheated by sn explosions and further raised to the virial temperature of the potential well . besides , a fraction of the hot gas may be expelled by sn winds ; this depends on the key paremeter @xmath13 , defining the fraction of sn energy going into kinetic energy .",
    "the sams also include coalescence of baryons following halo merging and the luminosity - colour evolution due to rise and fall of successive star generations . in the end",
    ", the statistics of the baryonic phases are related to the statistics of the dm halos , usually characterized in terms of their circular velocity @xmath14 .",
    "we developed an analytic version of the sams ( based on the extended press & schechter theory , see lacey & cole 1993 ) , to describe the above baryonic phases and the exchanges among them ( we refer to menci & cavaliere 1999 for an extended description of the model and of its results ) .",
    "the parametrizations we adopt are the same as in the sams .",
    "the star formation time scale and the sn feedback are related to @xmath14 by scaling laws depending on a set of four global parameters which , as described in cole et al .",
    "1994 , are related to the detailed parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we focus on two particular sets of parameters .",
    "the first ( model a ) is characterized by a relatively large value of @xmath15 . with this , the sn winds are effective in expelling hot gas from small halos . correspondingly , the resulting sfr we find ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is peaked at @xmath3 and then declines considerably for larger @xmath16 .",
    "the second set ( model b ) is characterized by a small @xmath17 ; in this case the sn are not effective in expelling baryons from the halos , but they heat them to somewhat larger temperatures compared with model a.",
    "the different conditions described by models a and b lead to different amounts and physical states for the hot baryons which are contained in the dm potential wells and emit in x - rays .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of groups or clusters may be written in the form ( cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1998 ) @xmath18    here the normalization is adjusted ( as usually ) so as to match the height of the observed _ local _",
    "@xmath4 relation at @xmath19 kev ; @xmath20 is the dm density of the halo ; the shape factor @xmath21 describes the internal icm distribution .",
    "in addition , @xmath22 denotes the density jump across the shock induced by the infalling gas , averaged over the merging histories , that is , over the probability to merge clumps @xmath23 onto @xmath24 ; @xmath22 is governed by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the temperature of infalling gas .",
    "the overall effect of @xmath27 is to depress the @xmath4 relation at the scale of groups , bending it down from the self - similar behaviour @xmath28 , which applies to very rich clusters ponman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the different amounts of hot baryons retained in small halos in model a and model b affect the @xmath16-evolution of the @xmath4 relation ( see fig .",
    "2 ) ; the considerable _ increase _ with @xmath16 at the faint end of @xmath29 found in model b reflects the larger amount of emitting baryons in the smaller halos , which dominate the statistics at @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , the larger amount of expelled diffuse baryons marking model a , together with the corresponding lower sn - induced temperature , make the shocks more effective in this case . correspondingly , the factor @xmath27 in eq .",
    "1 is more effective in bending down the @xmath4 relation from its self - similar shape .",
    "such effects of different sfr on the x - ray emission at the groups scale interestingly affect the deep source counts , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . note that at fluxes @xmath31 erg / s @xmath2 ( reachable , e.g. , by axaf ) a flat sfr implies counts larger by a factor @xmath32 with respect to a sfr declining for @xmath12 .",
