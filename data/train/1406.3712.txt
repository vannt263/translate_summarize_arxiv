    "in 1995 , jacobson @xcite derived einstein equations by demanding fundamental clausius relations @xmath0 for all the local rindler horizon through each spacetime point , with @xmath1 and t interpreted as the energy flux and uunruh temperature seen by the accelerated observer . in the frw universe , it is shown @xcite that the friedmann equation which describes the dynamics of the universe can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics associated with apparent horizon by assuming a temperature @xmath2 and an entropy @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and a are the radius and area of the apparent horizon , respectively . recently",
    ", it has been proposed that the expansion of the universe is attributed to the difference between the number of degrees of freedom on a holographic surface and the number of freedom in the bulk . in this paradigm ,",
    "the dynamic equation of a frw universe can be successfully derived .",
    "it has also been argued that for a pure de sitter universe with the hubble constant h , the holographic principle can be expressed as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the number of degrees of freedom on the spherical surface with the hubble radius @xmath7 for a flat frw universe and @xmath8 is the bulk degrees of freedom obeying the equipartition law , @xmath9 .",
    "our universe is not exactly de sitter but there is considerable evidence that it is asymptotically de sitter .",
    "this would suggest that the emergence of space should be related with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "+ an improved expansion law has been suggested for a non - flat frw universe in @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the expansion law is not yet well understood and there is not a general method to obtain the expansion law for a flat or non - flat universe . in this paper",
    ", attempts will be made to show that the first law of thermodynamics can be considered as the origin of the expansion law of the universe , or alternatively , that we can exploit the first law of thermodynamic as a convenient method to obtain the expansion law of the universe .",
    "we can derive the expansion law of the universe for a dynamic kodama observer . in this case , we use the unified first law of thermodynamics to obtain a correct form of the expansion law of the universe . a new gravity theory at a lifshitz point proposed by horava that referred as the horava - lifshitz theory .",
    "in this gravity due to the thermal fluctuations and quantum fluctuations , we should apply the quantum corrections to the horizon area @xcite . for f(r ) and the scalar tensor gravity , due to the non - equilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime , an additional entropy production term has to be added to the clausius relation @xcite , while this is not the case for einstein gravity . unlike einstein gravity , we should consider a generalized misner - sharp energy in these modified gravities @xcite .",
    "the dynamic equation of frw universe for the horava- lifshitz gravity and friedmann equations for f(r ) and scalar tensor gravities can be obtained based on the above considerations . + it is known that einstein s field equations can be obtained from the first law of thermodynamics , so we may represent the relationship between the first law of thermodynamics , einstein s field equations , and the expansion law of the universe on a triangle as in fig . [ figure 1 ] .",
    "it is interesting that by using only one of these relations , the two others can be derived .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will review and illustrate the first law of thermodynamics as the origin of the expansion law of the universe . in section 3",
    ", the unified first law of thermodynamics will be used to obtain the the expansion law of the universe for a dynamic kodama observer and we use the expansion law for kodama observer to obtain the dynamic equation of frw universe for deformed horava - lifshitz gravity . in section 4 , we will investigate f(r ) and scalar tensor gravities using our approach .",
    "in this part , we are going to review and explain how to derive the expansion law of the universe from the first law of thermodynamics so that we may interpret the first law of thermodynamic as the origin of the expansion law of the universe .",
    "it is a rather difficult task to define energy for a gravitational field in general relativity . due to the absence of the local energy density of gravitational field , it is tempting to define some meaningful quasi - local energy so that on the boundary of a given region in spacetime .",
    "indeed , it is possible to properly define such quasi - local energies as the misner - sharp energy @xcite .",
    "various properties of the misner - sharp energy are discussed in some detail by hayward in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the misner sharp energy surrounded by the apparent horizon @xmath11 of the frw universe is nothing but the total energy @xmath12 of matter inside the apparent horizon where , @xmath13 is the matter density and @xmath14 is the volume of the sphere with radius @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the hubble parameter and k is the spatial curvature of the universe . on the apparent horizon of a frw universe ,",
    "the energy crossing the apparent horizon within the time interval @xmath17 is given by : @xmath18 where , @xmath19 is the matter pressure , @xmath20 is the surface of the sphere with radius @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the hawking temperature @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we have used an approximate form of the unified first law of thermodynamics @xmath24 i.e. we assumed that the apparent horizon radius is constant @xmath25 and so @xmath23 and the first law of thermodynamic can be written as @xmath26 , for more details see @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 using equations ( [ form-2 ] ) and @xmath28 , the above equation can be rewritten as follows @xmath29    now , we want to obtain the expansion law for a non - flat frw universe by using the first law of thermodynamics . at first step , we have to define the bulk degrees of freedom .",
    "padmanabhan @xcite suggested that the bulk degrees of freedom @xmath8 is related to the komar energy @xcite by @xmath30 .",
    "it should be noted that we can not prove this relation and it is just postulated in @xcite .",
    "we also assume the same relation for definition of the bulk degrees of freedom .",
    "now by replacing @xmath31 in equation ( [ form-5 ] ) we obtain    @xmath32    it is interesting that the second term in equation ( [ form-63 ] ) can be related to the surface degrees of freedom ( @xmath33 ) . to illustrate , we use equation ( [ form-4 ] ) to obtain :    @xmath34    therefore , @xmath35 using eq .",
    "( [ form-4 ] ) , the last term in equation ( [ form-63 ] ) leads to an increase in volume @xmath36 ( the relation holding between volume v and area a with a radius @xmath4 is @xmath37 . )",
    "therefore , it is easily seen that the expansion law of universe , can be derived as follows    @xmath38    thus , we have shown that the expansion law of the universe can be obtained from the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "equation ( [ form-13 ] ) has already been obtained in @xcite by considering @xmath23 i.e. when the changing in apparent horizon is infinitesimal . in the next section",
    ", we are going to obtain the expansion law of the universe for a dynamic kodama observer by using the unified first law of thermodynamics @xmath24 .",
    "also we will obtain the modified dynamic equation of frw universe in a horava - lifshits gravity .",
    "there is no timelike killing vector in the dynamic spacetime .",
    "the kodama vector generates a preferred flow of time and is a dynamic analogue of a stationary killing vector @xcite . for a kodama observer ,",
    "we use the unified first law of thermodynamics and the hawking temperature detected by a kodama observer and defined as follows @xcite @xmath39 where , @xmath40 we assume that @xmath41 . in other words , we are dealing with an `` inner '' trapping horizon rather than an `` outer '' trapping one ( with a positive temperature ) .",
    "now , we investigate the expansion law for the asymptotic de sitter universe in view of the unified first law of thermodynamics . the unified first law of thermodynamics is expressed as follows @xcite @xmath42 where , @xmath43 the energy crossing the apparent horizon within the interval @xmath17 for this unified first law is @xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 therefore , the unified first law of thermodynamics can be written as follows @xmath47 using equations ( [ form-19 ] ) and ( [ form-20 ] ) , the above equation can be rewritten as follows @xmath48 therefore , by considering the misner - sharp energy , @xmath28 , we have @xmath49 using ( [ form-23 ] ) , the expansion law of universe for kodama observer can be obtained .",
    "reorganizing equation ( [ form-23 ] ) with the help of equations ( [ form-14]),([form-18 ] ) , and ( [ form-19 ] ) , we have @xmath50 the misner - sharp energy for the first law of thermodynamics can be obtained as follows @xcite @xmath51 with the help of equation ( [ form-17 ] ) and considering @xmath52 we get ( [ form-26 ] ) below : @xmath53 the above relation can be rewritten as the expansion law of the universe for a dynamic kodama observer as follows @xmath54 thus , it is shown that to obtain the expansion law for a kodama observer , we have to use the unified first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we , therefore , suggest the application of this fundamental relation of thermodynamics as the correct method for obtaining the expansion law and its generalized versions . for another approach see @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that equation ( [ form-30 ] ) is obtained for a kodama observer where the hawking temperature is defined in eq .",
    "( [ form-14 ] ) . we can not obtain ( [ form-13 ] ) just by replacing @xmath22 by @xmath55 in ( [ form-30 ] ) . for obtaining equation ( [ form-13 ] ) , we have to put @xmath56 in ( [ form-14 ] ) , ( [ form-19 ] ) and ( [ form-20 ] ) , and then do the rest of calculations .",
    "it is interesting that different observers use similar but distinct forms of the expansion law of the universe .",
    "we may argue that origin of this difference may go back to different forms of the first law of thermodynamics for different observers . in the following",
    "we will obtain modified dynamic equation of frw universe in a deformed horava - lifshitz gravity for a kodama observer .",
    "one of the quantum corrections applied to the horizon area is logarithmic correction that arises from loop quantum gravity due to thermal equilibrium fluctuations and quantum fluctuations . as a result",
    ", the entropy for deformed horava - lifshitz gravity is written as @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 is a dimensionless constant parameter of the theory .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom on the apparent horizon @xmath59 can be written as follows @xmath60 for a kodama observer the hawking temperature defined as follows @xmath61 by considering @xmath62 @xcite we can arrive to following relation @xmath63 substituting the above relations in equation ( [ form-30 ] ) we find the dynamic equation of frw universe for deformed horava - lifshitz gravity @xmath64 as expected , setting @xmath65 , the standard dynamic equation of frw universe can be obtained .",
    "the hawking temperature together with the black hole entropy is connected through the identity @xmath66 and is usually called the first law of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "it should be noted that the usual clausius relation @xmath67 holds for neither f(r ) nor scalar tensor gravities .",
    "hence , an internal entropy needs to be produced to balance the energy conservation , @xmath68 with @xcite @xmath69 where , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the horizon entropy of the black hole .",
    "we further define @xmath72 as an effective entropy associated with the apparent horizon of the frw universe .",
    "so , the field equation of f(r ) gravity can be rewritten as @xmath73 , where @xmath23 .",
    "+ unlike einstein gravity , the existence of the generalized misner - sharp energy depends on a constraint that should be satisfied in f(r ) gravity . for f(r )",
    "gravity , the generalized misner - sharp energy @xmath74 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath75    where , @xmath76 is related to @xmath77 as follows @xmath78 using equations ( 10 ) and ( 32 ) , we obtain the effective area as follows @xmath79    the effective number of degrees of freedom on the apparent horizon is @xmath80 and the cosmic volume is @xmath81 . by considering @xmath52 , we can also obtain the bulk degrees of freedom @xmath82 substituting the above relations into ( [ form-13 ] ) , we obtain the dynamic equation for f(r ) gravity @xmath83 where , @xmath84    @xmath85    integrating ( [ form-36 ] ) and using the continuity equation , @xmath86 , we get the familiar form of freidmann equations of the friedmann - robertson - walker universe for f(r ) gravity .    @xmath87    @xmath88    the above friedmann equations was obtained from the expansion law of the universe .    for a different approach to f(r ) gravity",
    "we will adopt the assumption @xmath89 , without the term that relates to the non - equilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime , therefore @xmath90 is as follows @xmath91 the number of degrees of freedom on the apparent horizon for this entropy is @xmath92    where @xmath93 in this way the effective terms relating to the non - equilibrium thermodynamics can be obtain by the energy - momentum tensor , therefore the komar energy is as follows @xmath94 where @xmath95    @xmath96    then the bulk degrees of freedon is given by @xmath97    it should be noted that additional terms due to the non- equilibrium thermodynamics can be apear into the energy- momentom tensor . with the above considerations we can derive the friedmann equation for this gravity @xmath98 in the first method , we obtain friedmann equation by using generalized entropy that is equivalente to its effect on the energy - momentum tensor .    also friedmann equation can be obtained by assuming @xmath3 @xcite . in this way",
    "the additional terms can be obtaion from the komar energy @xmath99 with the above definitions friedmann equation can be easilly derived .",
    "the same strategy may be applied to the scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "the entropy s of this gravity is of the form @xcite @xmath100 and , the clausius relation for this gravity is given by @xmath101 where , @xmath102 the generalized misner - sharp energy @xmath103 in this case can be explicitly expressed by @xmath104 following the same procedure as the one used for f(r ) gravity , we obtain @xmath76 that is related to @xmath77 for the scalar tensor gravity @xmath105 and the effective area is given by @xmath106    using the above equation , we can define the effective number of degrees of freedom on the apparent horizon",
    ". the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk will be the same as that in ( [ form-35 ] ) . substituting the above relations into the generalized expansion law ( [ form-13 ] ) , we arrive at the dynamic equation for scalar tensor gravity for the frw universe @xmath107 where , @xmath108 @xmath109 integrating on the above equations and using the continuity equation , we can obtain the friedmann equations as follows @xmath110    @xmath111    that is the familiar forms of the friedmann equations for scalar tensor gravity .",
    "in this paper , we suggest that using the first law of thermodynamics is a convenient method for obtaining the expansion law of the universe . it was shown that we can use the unified first law of thermodynamics to obtain the expansion law for the kodama observer .",
    "it is known that the first law of thermodynamics is equivalent to einstein field equations .",
    "so , we expect a relationship to exist between the first law of thermodynamics , einstein field equations , and the expansion law of the universe .",
    "we obtain the dynamic equation of frw universe for the horava - lifshitz gravity by using the expansion law for kodama observer .",
    "we have also obtained the friedmann equations for f(r ) and scalar tensor gravities by this approach .",
    "our method might be used as a general and simple approach for investigating other modified gravities ."
