    "astrophysical black holes are characterized by just two properties , their mass and angular momentum , since they will typically have zero charge @xcite . the angular momentum , @xmath2 , of a kerr black hole of mass @xmath3 ,",
    "can be defined in terms of a dimensionless spin @xmath4 which must lie in the range @xmath5 .",
    "there is mounting evidence that astrophysical black holes are rotating and that the corresponding spin is a critical variable in establishing the observed properties of the accreting black hole systems ( see discussion in ) as well as the magnitude and the impact that the outflows from these systems will have on their surroundings  see and references therein .",
    "the energy associated with this spin can be up to 30% of the gravitational mass in an extreme kerr black hole @xcite and is , in principle , available for extraction @xcite and so is a likely power source for phenomena such as jets from active galactic nuclei , microquasars and gamma ray bursts .",
    "understanding how black holes acquire their spins and , in the cosmological context , what the distribution of spins is , is therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "black holes can gain angular momentum either via mergers with other black holes or from the material that they accrete . in this paper , we restrict our discussion to accretion . was the first to consider the issue .",
    "assuming that the accretion proceeded via a cold disk and that the angular momentum of the accreting material was always aligned with the spin of the black hole , he noted that an accreting black hole would spin up to its maximal rate in a finite time ( i.e. after accreting around 1.5 times the initial black hole mass ) .",
    "recognized that thin disks radiate and as a result , the black hole spin would be limited to @xmath6 because the black hole would preferentially swallow negative angular momentum photons emitted by the accretion flow .",
    "a number of studies since then have suggested that this limit may not hold ( or that the limiting spin may be higher ) if accretion takes place via a geometrically thick flow .",
    ", who numerically solved the equations describing the steady state radial structure of hot , geometrically thick , relativistic , optically thin , advection - dominated accretion flow , found that the equilibrium spin can be as high as @xmath7 or as low as @xmath8 , depending on the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the flow ; they did not , however , take into account radiation swallowing . in the case of",
    "pure advection flows where none of the energy dissipated in the flow is radiated away , this is not an issue . finally ,",
    "as noted by j.  m.  bardeen ( related by ) , the effects of magnetic fields could potentially limit the spin to a significantly lower value by exerting torques on the accreting material .",
    "the potential role of magnetic fields has received increasing attention in the past decade , beginning with the works of and , who demonstrated that the magnetic fields expected on the basis of flux freezing should have order unity effects on the accretion flow and therefore , on the amount of energy released in that flow .",
    "the effects of magnetic fields have been studied further with the general consensus that magnetic stresses can significantly alter the spin - up of the black hole @xcite .",
    "in particular , used the second law of black hole thermodynamics to place constraints on the maximum accretion efficiency for a given black hole spin .",
    "they found a maximum efficiency of 0.36 , which would be attained if the equilibrium spin was 0.94 .    in recent years",
    ", the use of sophisticated general relativistic , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical simulations ( e.g. , ) have yielded considerable insights into the role of magnetic fields in accretion flows , and especially the efficacy of magnetic stresses at extracting rotational energy from a black hole - accretion flow system . in the specific simulations presented by and ,",
    "stresses associated with magnetic fields in the accretion flow resulted in the black hole evolving towards an equilibrium spin ( i.e. @xmath9 ) of @xmath10 ( specifically equilibrium occurs somewhere between their @xmath11 and @xmath12 simulations ) .",
    "note that this equilibrium value is relevant only to geometrically thick accretion flows .",
    "too reach a similar conclusion ( i.e. that there is an equilibrium spin at approximately @xmath13 ) by analyzing the mhd simulations of .",
    "a more in - depth review of these studies can be found in .",
    "to summarize , current mhd simulations of spinning black holes accreting from a geometrically thick accretion flow predict an equilibrium spin somewhere in the range @xmath13@xmath14 , the exact value being uncertain due to numerical limitations and the small number of simulations available . at higher values of @xmath15 , the black hole is spun - down .    a key feature of all of these mhd simulations is the emergence of unbounded outflows .",
    "these outflows can occur in the form of a highly collimated , poynting - flux dominated component generated both by the magnetized , rapidly rotating accretion flow as well as the rotation of the black hole @xcite , and as a broad , mildly relativistic , typically matter - dominated , component that originates in the accretion flow . in the present paper , we will use the generic label `` jet '' to refer to the outflows , regardless of whether they be broad or narrow , matter or poynting - flux dominated , and instead we will distinguish between outflow engendered by the magnetic fields anchored in the rotating flow ( hereafter referred to as the `` disk '' jet ) and that due to field lines anchored on the black hole event horizon ( the `` black hole '' jet ) .",
    "the black hole jet is primarily electromagnetic and the disk jet is hydromagnetic , where the energy ( and the angular momentum ) is carried by an electromagnetic flux as well as a kinetic flux of matter .",
    "while a detailed , universally accepted , description of the mechanisms underlying the origin and power of these jets remains elusive , the combination of the results from simulations with different parameters and analysis of simplified analytic models , suggests the following tentative picture that we use as a basis for our model for the jets ( see appendix  [ app : jet ] ) :    as a starting point , we are interested in black holes situated at centres of galaxies and clusters of galaxies . in such systems , the gas accreting onto the black hole will have originally flowed in from kiloparsecs - scale via a cooling flow and a quasi - spherical accretion flow . during the latter stage",
    ", the magnetothermal instability is expected to organize the existing weak magnetic fields into primarily radial fields ( e.g.  ) .",
    "we will therefore assume that there is a weak , large - scale poloidal component present in the accretion flow onto the black hole . although the detailed geometric structure of the flow as it converges onto the black hole will depend on whether the gas is able to radiate away its thermal energy , generically the flow will be rotating and axisymmetric in character .",
    "in the present paper , we will focus primarily on geometrically thick , advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) .",
    "several mhd processes are expected to arise in the flow : the shearing of the poloidal field within the rotating fluid will give rise to a toroidal field and the flow will be subject to mhd turbulence .",
    "these features have been confirmed by the various simulations .",
    "the magnetic fields anchored in the rotating flow will give rise to a combination of outflow of material from the disk and its surroundings , and an electromagnetic flux , with the former dominating if the black hole is spinning relatively slowly .",
    "as recognized by (; see also ) , if the black hole is spinning , the frame - dragging of the inflowing gas within the ergosphere will enhance the magnitude of the outflow .",
    "in fact , according to , not only do the numerical simulations by confirm that the power of the hydromagnetic disk jet indeed grows with black hole spin , but that the rise in power is very steep at high black hole spin rates and that this steep increase is primarily due to growth in the power of the electromagnetic component of the disk jet .",
    "finally , when the accretion flow reaches the black hole event horizon , the gas is expected to drain off the field lines . in the case of a non - rotating black hole",
    ", the magnetic pressure will cause the field lines , which for all intents and purposes can be thought of as being anchored on the black hole s event horizon , to establish a nearly radial configuration in the polar regions similar to the split - monopole structure first described by . in the event that the black hole is spinning ,",
    "the winding of the magnetic field lines in the ergosphere will drive helical twists along the magnetic tower that manifests as highly collimated , poynting - flux dominated jets .    in the picture outlined above , the combined disk+black hole jet therefore draws its energy from the gravitational energy released by the accretion flow as well as the rotational energy of the black hole itself .",
    "consequently , the jet power does not vanish in the case of a schwarzchild black hole .",
    "this is consistent with simulation results in that studies exploring the relationship between the outflow structure and power , and the spin of the black hole ( e.g. ) all find that disk winds persist even when the black hole is not rotating .",
    "however , in cases where the magnetic field lines are appropriately orientated , the presence of a rapidly spinning black hole can greatly enhance the outflow power .",
    "this link between black hole spin and outflow power has long been indicated from theoretical considerations ( c.f .",
    ".    given that the jets gain a fraction of their power by tapping the rotational energy of the black hole , we can estimate the braking torque exerted on the black hole and consequently , the maximum spin attainable by an accreting black hole driving powerful jets . utilizing the understanding of jet production developed by these simulations ,",
    "we construct a simple , analytical model for the maximum spin attainable through accretion . to do this ,",
    "we assume an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) onto a spinning black hole whose global structure resembles the numerical solutions of , and we examine how the accretion - driven spin - up of a black hole is modified when jets are produced as a consequence of that accretion . using a simple model for the jet power , where a fraction of the jet power is extracted from the rotational energy of the black hole , we derive a modified spin - up function and thereby predict the equilibrium value of the black hole spin . in the process",
    ", we also determine the dependence of jet efficiency as a function of black hole spin .",
    "we wish to compute the rate of spin - up for a black hole accreting from a geometrically thick , advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) that also engenders powerful jets .",
    "we will begin by examining the classical calculation of the spin up of a black hole accreting from a thin disk and with no jet production .",
    "we will then proceed to modify this calculation to describe accretion from an adaf and finally , quantify how jet production alters this spin - up .      as stated above",
    ", we quantify the angular momentum of a kerr black hole by the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "we follow the notation of and define a dimensionless spin - up function @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rate of rest mass accretion . for a standard ,",
    "relativistic , keplerian thin - disk accretion flow with no magnetic fields , we will denote the expected spin - up function due to accretion by @xmath20 .",
    "gives @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the ( dimensionless ) specific angular momentum and specific energy of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the black hole respectively .",
    "this relationship implicitly assumes that ( a ) the inner edge of the disk coincides approximately with the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit , inside of which the centrifugal force is unable to balance gravity and the gas begins to free - fall inward , and ( b ) that the torque at this inner boundary is negligible since the gas in the plunging region will quickly accelerate to supersonic speeds and lose causal contact with the material upstream .",
    "this `` no - torque '' boundary condition has been a subject of some debate but both and have independently shown that in the case of thin disks , the assumption is reasonable .",
    "moreover , recent simulations @xcite confirm that the torque is negligible ( at least for @xmath23 ) .",

    "the net spin - up rate in the case of thin disk accretion is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the spin - down rate due to radiation swallowing as given by .",

    "thin disks are expected to be features of radiatively efficient accretion flows and therefore , typically associated with optically luminous active galactic nuclei .",
    "the black hole systems that are of particular interest to us , i.e. , supermassive black holes that reside at the centres of massive elliptical galaxies , are typically optically - dim . in the inner regions , these systems",
    "are thought to be accreting in an optically thin , advection - dominated mode , in which the density of the accreting gas is sufficiently low that the gas can not radiate efficiently ; the energy dissipated during the accretion remains in the flow in the form of thermal energy and is eventually carried across the horizon @xcite .    whether the accretion flow is geometrically thin and radiatively efficient , or geometrically thick , optically thin , low luminosity and advection - dominated , or for that matter , geometrically thick , optically thick , luminous but yet advection - dominated , depends largely on the mass accretion rate .",
    "estimates of mass accretion rates onto the supermassive black holes in massive elliptical galaxies ( c.f . , ) yield very low values and at low mass accretion rates , the flow is expected to be an optically thin , low - luminosity adaf .",
    "the physical structure of an adaf is very different from that of a thin disk .",
    "consequently , the thin - disk expression for @xmath31 is unlikely to be correct for an adaf .",
    "a priori , one would expect both the specific angular momentum and the specific energy of the accreted material to differ from the thin - disk expectations .",
    "we therefore write the spin - up rate for adafs as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are normally evaluated at the horizon .    in the case of an ideal , unmagnetized adaf , in which the gas starts out cold at large radii and all dissipated energy is advected along with the flow , the ( dimensionless ) specific energy of the accreted material is @xmath35 @xcite , while the specific angular momentum of the accreted gas is typically sub - keplerian @xcite .",
    "recent simulations , which include the effects of magnetic fields and allow for the exploration of less constrained flow structures , confirm the expectation for the angular momentum , that it is typically less than the thin - disk result , but suggest that the energy of the accreted material is in fact close to the thin - disk value ( see figure  5 of and also ) . in this paper",
    ", we will show results for both values for the specific energy of the accreting material , the thin - disk value as indicated by the simulations as well as the ideal adaf value .    to quantify the accreted angular momentum ( and , as described in the next section , to estimate jet power ) , we need a model for the adaf accretion flow . to this end , we make use of the results of , who numerically solved the equations describing the radial structure of steady state , optically thin , advection - dominated accretion flow in a kerr metric ( see also , ) .",
    "though more cumbersome to use than the simple , easy - to - manipulate , self - similar solutions of , they offer one key advantage over the latter : an improved treatment of the flow in the innermost regions of the adaf where the self - similar results break down .",
    "the resulting adaf model includes the effects of magnetic fields to the extent that the flow is treated as a mixture of a frozen - in , isotropically tangled , turbulent magnetic fields and ionized plasma .",
    "it does not , however , account for large - scale magnetic fields or mhd effects , like the amplification of magnetic fields by dynamo - like processes and mhd winds . on the other hand",
    ", explicitly illustrate how the flow structure depends on the black hole spin @xmath15 , the adiabatic index @xmath36 quantifying the strength of the turbulent magnetic fields in the flow , the viscosity parameter @xmath37 governing the transport of angular momentum in the flow , and the advected fraction of the dissipated energy @xmath38 .    for the purposes at hand ,",
    "we adopt their @xmath39 ( pure advection flow ) results and to facilitate the use of these solutions in this ( and future ) work , we have derived analytic fits to key adaf structural quantities , from which additional properties of the flow can be derived .",
    "these simple fitting functions are listed in appendix  [ app : adaf ] . for simplicity s sake",
    ", we shall assume that the rate of angular momentum accretion by the black hole per unit rest mass accreted , @xmath33 , is equal to the value of the specific angular momentum of the accreting fluid near the horizon .",
    "this is tantamount to assuming a `` no - torque '' boundary condition at the horizon . strictly speaking",
    ", this condition does not apply to geometrically thick flows but in the model under consideration , the rate of angular momentum transport is very small near the horizon and the two quantities agree to within @xmath4020% .    in popham and gammie s treatment ,",
    "the viscous stress is assumed to result from the combined effect of correlated , large - scale , time - averaged reynolds and maxwell stresses that they associate with mhd turbulence .",
    "they model this stress using a modified form of the @xmath37-viscosity prescription designed to ensure causal behaviour and their @xmath37 parameter is defined in terms of the total pressure , which includes the contribution of the turbulent magnetic field pressure .",
    "assume that @xmath37 , as well as all other parameters mentioned above , are constant over the radial extent of the flow .",
    "mhd simulation studies of magnetized accretion flows suggest that this approach does not do justice to the rich dynamics involved .",
    "for one , mhd simulations of accretion flows around black holes have long indicated that the effective value of @xmath37 is a strong function of radius in the inner regions of the flow @xcite , rising from @xmath41 over the bulk of the flow to @xmath42 in the plunging region ( see , for example , fig .  4 in and fig .  12 in )",
    ", with the large value of @xmath37 corresponding to a non - negligible flux of angular momentum being carried out from inside the isco as a result of the presence of magnetic fields . in the present work , we recognize these limitations of the @xmath37-viscosity formalism and use @xmath37 merely as a parameter characterizing the structure of the accretion flow .",
    "we choose its value so that the spin - up function that includes the effects of outflows ( see  [ sec : spinup ] ) is comparable to the results seen in mhd simulations .    allowing @xmath37 to vary as a function of black hole spin @xmath15",

    "[ eq : varalpha ]    this dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath15 makes qualitative sense if one expects that the angular momentum transport is facilitated by magnetic fields and that the amplitude of these fields ought to grow as the black hole spin is increased .",
    "such a correlation between magnetic field strength and black hole spin has been noted in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as we shall show below , the resulting flow structure , when combined with our jet power model , leads to jet efficiencies comparable to those seen in complex mhd simulations , suggesting that our model may be useful for calculating global properties of agn systems that are required as input in theories of galaxy , group and cluster formation .",
    "we note that given our usage , our @xmath37-parameter values can not be directly compared to physical quantities such as the effective magnetic @xmath37 of and .",
    "in fact , the very concept of @xmath37-viscosity is not central to our argument .",
    "any accretion flow with similar structural properties in the inner regions should yield similar results .",
    "the net spin - up function , @xmath43 , for our adaf model is shown in figure  [ fig : spineq ] as cyan curves .",
    "the solid curves show the spin - up function for an ideal adaf ( @xmath44 ) while the dashed curves show the spin - up function for the case @xmath45 , as suggested by numerical simulations .",
    "the curves in the left plot are computed using @xmath46 while those in the right plot make use of @xmath47 .",
    "we note that in calculating the spin - up rate for an adaf , we do not include a spin - down term due to radiation swallowing since radiation is not a factor in the case of pure advection flows .",
    "however , we computed the @xmath27 term out of curiosity and found it to be small for all @xmath15 ; including it makes no noticeable difference to our results . for the case",
    "@xmath45 ( @xmath44 ) , the spin - up curve is positive for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and slowly spinning black holes will be spun up as accretion proceeds . for higher values of @xmath15 ,",
    "the spin - up curve is negative and the accretion from the adaf will spin down rapidly whirling black holes . the cross - over point between these two regimes demarcates the equilibrium black hole spin value for accretion via an adaf .",
    "specifically , the equilibrium spin is @xmath50 for @xmath45 and @xmath51 for @xmath44 .",
    "the lower equilibrium spin value relative to the thin disk case is the consequence of the accreting fluid s specific angular momentum being sub - keplerian .",
    "we now consider what happens when a jet is launched in conjunction with accretion onto a black hole .",
    "there is a considerable body of work indicating that the launching of jets is most efficient when the accretion flow is advection - dominated ( e.g. ) and that jet production is suppressed in thin disks @xcite .",
    "we will therefore use the adaf model described previously as our working platform .",
    "jets are , however , inherently magnetohydrodynamic phenomena @xcite and our adaf model does not treat such effects . as a workaround",
    ", we follow the approach outlined by in developing a model for jet power and graft it onto our adaf model .",
    "this approach implicitly assumes the basic structure of the accretion flow will not be significantly altered by the implied presence of strongly ordered magnetic fields in the inner regions .",
    "recent numerical simulation results of seem to support this .    the jet model that we use is described in appendix  [ app : jet ] .",
    "the basic physical idea underlying our model is that the electromagnetic flux and plasma outflow that comprise the jet are due to a rotating helical tower of magnetic field lines engendered by the differential frame dragging of a preferentially poloidal field anchored on the event horizon , as well as the combined effect of differential rotation of the plasma in the body of the disk and differential frame - dragging of the plasma inside the black hole s ergosphere on the poloidal field lines anchored in the accretion flow ( see ) . in this model",
    ", the jet therefore draws its energy from the energy released by accretion as well as the rotational energy of the black hole itself , with the contribution from the latter dominating when the black hole is spinning close to its maximal rate .",

    "however , we would expect this efficiency to be relevant to an accretion system that has been spun up by an adaf and then transitions to a radiatively efficient thin - disk mode but has not yet been in this new state long enough to alter the black hole spin . for completeness",
    ", we note that in general , the radiative efficiency of an agn can be modeled approximately as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the eddington - scaled mass accretion rate and @xmath104 is the rate above which the accretion flow becomes radiatively efficient @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_jet ] , we show the jet efficiency as a function of @xmath15 for our fiducial @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( solid and dashed blue lines ) , and compare these to the available results from numerical simulations .",
    "the magenta curves show the black hole jet efficiency , which vanishes at zero black hole spin ; the cyan curves show the disk jet efficiency , which asymptotes to @xmath105 as @xmath15 vanishes ; and the blue curves show the efficiency factor for the total jet power .",
    "the simulation results are shown as green and red circles .",
    "the filled circles show the efficiency of the combined power in electromagnetic and matter outflows , and the open circles show the efficiency associated with the electromagnetic jet . while there remain significant differences between the various numerical calculations of @xmath106 ( e.g.",
    "there is an order of magnitude difference in the jet power at @xmath107 as determined by the two different calculations ) , there is a clear and rapid increase in jet efficiency with rising @xmath15 .",
    "this is reproduced by our model , which is in reasonably good agreement with the simulation results .",
    "specifically , the simulation results indicate that even at @xmath78 , there are outflows from accretion flow - black hole system .",
    "our model reproduces this non - zero jet efficiency at zero spin and indicates that it is powered entirely by the rotation of the accreting plasma . at intermediate spins ( @xmath1080.8 ) ,",
    "the black hole jet dominates . at high spins ( @xmath109 ) ,",
    "the simulation results show a rapid rise in power .",
    "our black hole jet model , which is based on the blandford - znajek model @xcite , does not rise as rapidly and this has been one of the many criticisms of this particular model .",
    "our total jet power , however , does show a steep rise and the results are consistent with the simulation results .",
    "the steep rise is driven by a sharp increase in the disk jet power . in our model",
    ", we can not distinguish whether this steep rise in the disk jet power is due to increase in the kinetic flux of the matter outflow , the electromagnetic flux , or both .",
    "however , an analysis of the numerical simulations has led to conclude that for high spins , the effects of frame - dragging can not only result in disk jet that is poynting - flux dominated but also enhance its power so that it dwarfs the black hole jet .",
    "jets appear to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in accreting black hole systems , with both the accretion flow as well as the black hole s rotational energy contributing to the jet power .",
    "the question of how much energy can be extracted from an accretion flow - rotating black hole system has been addressed previously by a number of groups , the most recent being .",
    "the jets , however , also carry away angular momentum from the system and most of these studies have not considered the implications of this angular momentum extraction . since jets emitted by systems with rotating black holes derive a fraction of their power from the spin of the accreting black hole @xcite , they must exert a braking torque on the black hole .",
    "jets , therefore , must play a central role in limiting the spin - up of black holes .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the spin equilibrium is the result of the coupling between the black hole , the accretion disk and the jet outflows mediated by magnetic fields .",
    "the detailed mechanism through which the magnetic fields couple the rotational energy of the black hole to the outflows is a topic of a number of on - going analytic and numerical investigations , and we presented a summary of some of the recent insights and thinking about the origin of the jet phenomenon in  1 . in this paper , we have described a simple calculation that attempts to capture some of the aspects of the complex process summarized above in the form of a highly simplified model .",
    "the resulting calculation , based on the adaf model summarized in appendix  [ app : adaf ] and jet model summarized in appendix  [ app : jet ] , indicates that any black hole which has undergone significant accretion ( i.e. more than doubling its mass ) from an adaf - type flow will have a spin of approximately @xmath94 providing it remains undisturbed afterwards ( i.e. no mergers or subsequent accretion by other means ) .",
    "moreover , the predicted equilibrium spin should be independent of the initial spin state .",
    "for example , a black hole that begins accreting from an adaf with an initial @xmath110 ( where the jet power is very large ) will be rapidly spun - down to the equilibrium value . essentially , any black hole driving a sufficiently powerful jet will reach an equilibrium spin @xmath111 .",
    "this fundamental result  that black holes driving powerful jets must experience a braking torque which plays a central role in limiting their spin  is independent of the details of the model that we employ .",
    "the calculation we present is in excellent agreement with results from mhd simulations of accreting black hole systems .",
    "specifically , we show that by using a model that matches the spin - up function measured in the numerical mhd simulations , we are able to self - consistently explain the jet efficiencies measured in the same simulations .",
    "this dual agreement is a pleasant surprise , given the simplifications and approximations inherent in our quasi - analytic approach and suggests that our model represents a convenient useful description of adaf inflow ",
    "jet outflow that can be easily incorporated in semi - analytic modeling as well as numerical simulations focusing on the formation and evolution of galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "numerous studies have shown that agn feedback , both kinetic and radiative , is critical for preventing the formation of overluminous , much too blue , massive galaxies @xcite and for tempering massive cooling flows that ought to have been present in at least 30% of galaxy clusters @xcite , but which the observations suggest are much weaker @xcite .",
    "the nominal explanation is that radiative energy loss that underlies the cooling flow phenomena is being partially offset by heating by outflows from supermassive agns in cluster galaxies .",
    "recently , analyzed x - ray and optical data from set of nine nearby , x - ray luminous giant elliptical galaxies that show evidence of jet outflow - related activity and found a remarkably tight correlation between the estimated bondi accretion rate , where @xmath112 is the accretion radius , @xmath113 is the gravitational constant , @xmath114 is the black hole mass , @xmath115 is the sound speed of the gas at @xmath116 , @xmath117 is the density of gas at @xmath116 and @xmath118 is a numerical coefficient that depends on the adiabatic index of the gas . ] and the estimated jet powers in these systems of the form : @xmath119 , where @xmath120",
    ". the results are consistent with those expected from the adaf - jet model of the kind presented in the paper especially if one allows for the fact that not all of the mass flow at the bondi radius will actually accrete onto the black hole .",
    "for example , if @xmath121 where @xmath122 , then the jet efficiency factor , as defined and used in this paper , is @xmath123 . a careful analysis of the constraints on @xmath106 imposed by the trend found by led to conclude that the resulting black holes must be spinning rapidly ( i.e. @xmath124 ) .",
    "an examination of fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_jet ] shows that the use of our model leads to very similar conclusions .",
    "more importantly , though , fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_jet ] shows that jet efficiency is a strong function of the black hole spin . over the range , @xmath125 , @xmath106 varies by approximately two orders of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that if the spin of the black holes in massive elliptical galaxies is unconstrained and any value between 0.8 and 1 is equally likely , then one would expect to find @xmath126 varying by as much as two orders of magnitude for a given value of @xmath127 and therefore , the plot should have resembled a scatterplot .",
    "the fact that it does not indicates that the black hole spins are not unconstrained but rather , span a tight distribution .",
    "we argue , based on the findings presented in this paper , that the most natural value for the black hole spins to cluster about is the equilibrium spin value of @xmath94 .    constraining the black hole spins to @xmath94 , with the corresponding jet efficiency of @xmath128",
    ", further implies that @xmath129% of the material bondi flow accretes on the black hole .",
    "this surprisingly large fraction indicates that the black hole is very efficient at capturing material within its bondi radius , which for the systems in question is approximately @xmath130-@xmath131 parsecs .    finally , we emphasize that the calculation arguing for the existence of a spin equilibrium at @xmath132 is predicated on the accretion disk - black hole system driving powerful outflows from an adaf .",
    "black holes accreting via thin accretion disks will behave very differently .",
    "the jet power produced by a thin disk is around three to four orders of magnitude smaller than that from an adaf for @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "the maximum @xmath134 for a standard thin disk occurs at @xmath12 .",
    "this is much less than @xmath135 which is approximately @xmath136 at the same @xmath15 .",
    "the jet will have little impact on the black hole spin and our model predicts that a black hole spun up by accretion from a thin disk should reach the limiting spin of @xmath137 found by .",

    "we will assume that these two jets arise from the same physical mechanism , differing primarily in the radii from which they originate .",
    "there is a considerable body of work indicating that the launching of jets is most efficient when the accretion flow is geometrically thick , advection - dominated flow ( e.g. , ) and least efficient when it proceeds via a geometrically thin accretion disk normally associated with radiatively efficient agns @xcite .",
    "while a detailed understanding of the extragalactic agn jet phenomena remains elusive , the combination of physically insightful analytic studies by a number of authors over the past three decades and recent sophisticated general relativistic , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical simulations are beginning to yield important insights .",
    "there is now a general consensus that jets are fundamentally mhd events . since our adaf model described in appendix  [ app : adaf ]",
    "does not treat mhd effects , we will develop a separate model for jet power that can then be coupled to our adaf model .",

    ", we will assume a characteristic radius equal to the static limit ( i.e. the edge of the ergosphere ) in the disk plane , @xmath179 , i.e.  @xmath180 in gravitational units .",
    "for the disk jet , we identify the characteristic radius with @xmath181 under the assumption that the jet originates from the region interior to the inner edge of the adaf and that this inner edge coincides with @xmath181 .",
    "we acknowledge that there is an ambiguity associated with this identification .",
    "as discussed by and , there is no reason for the inner edge to occur precisely at the isco and , furthermore , the location of the `` inner edge '' will depend on the physical property that defines that edge .",
    "the various simulation studies suggest that the launch region could be a factor of 23 inside the isco . under our scheme",
    ", a smaller characteristic radius would lead to slightly higher jet power .",
    "for example , at @xmath13 , the jet power is enhanced by a factor of two if the innermost edge occurs half - way between the isco and the event horizon .",

    "[ eq : framedrag ] ) and @xmath185 is angular frequency of the rotating fluid with respect to the local inertial observer , also often referred to as the zero angular momentum observer ( zamo ) .",

    "refer to this observer s reference frame as the locally non - rotating frame .    to complete our calculation of the jet power , we need to estimate the magnitude of the large - scale poloidal component of the magnetic field , as seen by the observer at infinity in the boyer - lindquist coordinate system .",
    "this field is related to that in the fluid rest frame by a boost factor @xmath186 : @xmath187 where @xcite : @xmath188    in our adaf model , we assumed that the magnetic field is isotropically tangled .",
    "the field in an accreting flow , however , is unlikely to be isotropic due to the presence of weak , ordered magnetic fields , and the results of mhd dynamo effects induced by turbulence as well as large - scale shearing motions .",
    "( see also references therein ) suggest that under such circumstances , the relationship between the toroidal and the poloidal components of the magnetic field can be approximated as @xmath189 .",
    "the resulting magnetic energy density is @xmath190 . identifying this with the magnetic field energy density in our adaf ( i.e. , @xmath191 ) and noting that @xmath192 at @xmath181 @xcite",
    ", we can estimate @xmath193 .",
    "the approach described here is based on the implicit assumption that the basic structure of the accretion flow will not change significantly by the implied presence of strongly ordered magnetic fields in the inner regions .",
    "recent numerical simulation results of suggest that this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "additionally , has argued that in the inner regions of the adaf , the shear associated the differential dragging of reference frames will drive a dynamo that will draw on the poloidal component of the magnetic field to generate and amplify the toroidal component at the expense of the black hole s rotational energy .",
    "this effect too has been tentatively observed in recent mhd numerical simulations @xcite . denoting the corresponding field enhancement factor as @xmath194 , @xmath195    the amplitude of this enhancement factor depends on the black hole spin through the angular velocity of spacetime rotation , @xmath70 . in the case of a non - rotating black hole ,",
    "@xmath196 and @xmath74 ( i.e. , no field enhancement ) . the enhancement factor also depends on the characteristic timescale , @xmath71 , over which the field amplification would occur .",
    "the timescale typically associated with mhd processes is the orbital period of the rotating fluid as determined by the local inertial observer , @xmath197 , but doing so involves an implicit assumption that that radial motion of the fluid is negligible .",
    "such an approximation is reasonable if the characteristic radius of the jet is sufficiently far from the horizon ; however , in the case of the black hole jet , the static limit is always close to the horizon . for the disk jet ,",
    "as the black hole spin parameter tends towards unity , @xmath181 approaches the horizon , the radial velocity grows rapidly and the flow becomes increasingly radial in character .",
    "the rapid inflow will decrease the amount of time available for field enhancement .",
