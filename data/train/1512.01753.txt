    "\\iii ) we have also provided experimental evidence of the suppression of the spinon confinement by large transverse field , which is manifested by the collapse of the spinon hierarchy .",
    "this , however , does not result in deconfined spinons , but leads to the emergent - fermion excitations of the 1d transverse - field ising class , because the transverse field is too strong to be treated as perturbation and even a phase transition from the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase is induced .",
    "the evolution of emergent fermions in high transverse fields has been revealed by the terahertz spectroscopy and by studying low - energy spin dynamics of the 1d ising - like xxz model using the method of infinite time evolving block decimation . a quantum critical point of transverse - field ising class",
