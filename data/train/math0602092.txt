    "an unknotting operation is a local operation that allows us to untie every knot in finitely many steps .",
    "the most popular unknotting operation is a simple crossing change .",
    "every unknotting operation gives rise to a measure of complexity for knots , called an unknotting number .",
    "an effective lower bound for the usual unknotting number was introduced by rasmussen ( @xcite ) .",
    "his invariant led to an easy computation of the genera and unknotting numbers of torus knots . in this paper",
    ", we study the sharp unknotting operation via rasmussen s invariant  @xmath0 .    the sharp unknotting operation is a local move that acts on link diagrams , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "it has been introduced by murakami ( @xcite ) and gives rise to the unknotting number @xmath1 . the usual unknotting number is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3    our main result involves a special sharp operation , called a positive sharp operation .",
    "a positive sharp operation introduces eight positive crossings to a link diagram , as shown in figure  2 .",
    "@xmath4    for a diagram @xmath5 of a knot @xmath6 , we denote by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the writhe of @xmath5 ( i.e. the algebraic crossing number of @xmath5 ) , the number of seifert circles of @xmath5 , and the genus of @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath5 be any knot diagram , and suppose @xmath10 is obtained from @xmath5 by the application of  @xmath11 positive sharp operations . if @xmath12 then @xmath10 represents a non - alternating knot .",
    "the quantity on the right hand side of the inequality in theorem  1 is always positive , as follows from bennequin s inequality ( @xcite ) . for positive knot diagrams , it is actually zero",
    ".    let @xmath5 be a positive knot diagram , and suppose @xmath10 is obtained from @xmath5 by the application of one positive sharp operation .",
    "then @xmath10 represents a non - alternating knot .    1 .   the closure of the braid @xmath13 represents the trivial knot @xmath14 . for the corresponding knot diagram @xmath5 ( see figure  3 , on the left hand side )",
    ", bennequin s inequality is an equality : @xmath15 therefore , if we apply one positive sharp operation at the top of this braid diagram , we obtain a non - alternating knot .",
    "it is a 2-cable of the positive trefoil knot .",
    "the closure of the braid @xmath16 represents the trivial knot , too ( see figure  3 , on the right hand side ) . by corollary  1 , the application of one positive sharp operation at the top of that braid diagram yields a non - alternating knot .",
    "this time , we obtain the knot @xmath17 , in rolfsen s notation ( @xcite ) .",

    "the diagram @xmath5 of the 2-cable knot @xmath6 we constructed above has 4 seifert circles and writhe 11 , whence @xmath22 .",

    "the diagram @xmath5 of the knot @xmath17 we constructed above has 4 seifert circles and writhe 11 .",
    "again , we conclude @xmath25 . +",
    "the proofs of theorems  1 and  2 are based upon the following three properties of rasmussen s invariant  @xmath0 :      the first two properties were proved by rasmussen ( @xcite ) , whereas the third inequality was proved by shumakovitch ( @xcite ) . the main argument in the proof of  ( 3 ) is rudolph s reduction to the case of positive diagrams ( @xcite ) .",
    "as we remarked after theorem  2 , the usual unknotting number  @xmath2 can not exceed @xmath18 .",
    "together with the inequality  ( 1 ) , this immediately proves the first statement of theorem  2 : @xmath30 in @xcite , murakami proved the following estimate for @xmath1 , in terms of the signature @xmath31 of a knot : @xmath32 this implies the second statement of theorem  2 :    let @xmath6 be a knot with @xmath21 .",
    "murakami s inequality tells us that @xmath33 if , in addition , @xmath6 is alternating , then @xmath27 , by  ( 2 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath6 is the trivial knot . in any case",
    ", @xmath36 holds .    in order to prove theorem  1",
    ", we have to study the behaviour of the numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 under a positive sharp operation : a positive sharp operation increases the writhe by 8 and leaves the number of seifert circles invariant .",
    "now , let @xmath5 be any knot diagram of a knot @xmath6 .",
    "further , suppose @xmath10 is obtained from @xmath5 by the application of  @xmath11 positive sharp operations .",
    "@xmath10 represents a knot @xmath37 . using  ( 3 ) , we find the following lower bound for @xmath38 : @xmath39 on the other hand , we have the following upper bound for the signature @xmath40 : @xmath41 the first inequality is due to murakami ( @xcite ) : the signature of a knot can not increase by more than 6 under a sharp operation .",
    "the second inequality is obvious , since the signature of a knot @xmath6 is the signature of a seifert matrix of size @xmath42 .",
    "now , if @xmath12 then @xmath43 whence @xmath37 is non - alternating .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  1 .    throughout this paper",
    ", we could replace rasmussen s invariant @xmath0 by the concordance invariant @xmath44 coming from knot floer homology , since the three properties ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are also valid for @xmath44 . a list of properties that are shared by @xmath0 and @xmath44 is contained in @xcite . in the same paper , m.  hedden and ph .",
