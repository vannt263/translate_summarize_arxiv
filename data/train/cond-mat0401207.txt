    "laughlin  @xcite has shown that for strongly interacting electrons in a magnetic field at certain fractional fillings @xmath3 of the landau levels , the maxima in the pair correlation function correspond to the equilibrium positions in a classical one dimensional plasma where the electrons interact via a repulsive logarithmic potential .",
    "the idea was extended to quantum dots  @xcite with few electrons as well as bosons and to rings  @xcite with a few electrons .",
    "it was shown that the electrons actually get localized at the positions where the pair correlation function peaks and the excitations of the system can be understood as rotational modes of the center of mass and vibrational modes .",
    "the eigenenergies of the system can be easily determined from the frequencies of the classical normal modes to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "in this paper we consider systems with various confinement potentials containing particles interacting through a repulsive _ logarithmic _ interaction .",
    "as the solution of the 2d poisson equation yields a logarithmic potential , one can say that the coulomb potential in a 2d world is logarithmic .",
    "vortices in a film of liquid helium interact through a logarithmic potential  @xcite .",
    "also vortices in a type ii superconducting 2d film , for a low concentration of vortices , is expected to interact through a logarithmic potential  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic interaction between vortices was used to study the stable vortex configurations in a disk shaped superconductor  @xcite .",
    "since the vortices are infinitely long in the @xmath4-direction , the symmetry makes it effectively 2d .",
    "hence the model may have some experimental realizations and it may be possible to verify experimentally the predictions made here .    in section",
    "ii we describe our model systems .",
    "the results for the ground state configurations are shown in section iii , and for the spectra in section iv .",
    "section v tests the sensitivity of the results by looking at the spectrum of vortices in a type ii superconductor , which interact through a logarithmic potential for a large penetration depth .",
    "our conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the hamitonian of a 2d system of @xmath5 charged particles in a @xmath0 confinement potential and interacting through a repulsive logarithmic potential is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the particle , @xmath8 the radial confinement frequency , and @xmath9 the position of the @xmath10th particle with @xmath11 .",
    "a hard wall confinement is obtained for @xmath12 and in this case @xmath13 equals the radius of the hard wall .",
    "the interaction potential is taken to be logarithmic : @xmath14    we can write the hamiltonian in a dimensionless form if we express the coordinates and energy in the following units : @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "the dimensionless hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 in the limit of a hard wall confinement , the lengthunit becomes @xmath18 .",
    "we also present results for the actual interaction potential for vortices in a type ii superconductor for @xmath19 as well as for smaller values of @xmath20 ( with @xmath20 the penetration depth ) .",
    "vortices in a type ii superconductor interact with a potential  @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 the zero - order hankel function with imaginary argument , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the flux quantum . in the limit of @xmath25 ,",
    "this potential becomes logarithmic : @xmath26 with the above units , the dimensionless form of this interaction potential is @xmath27 where now also @xmath20 is expressed in the unit @xmath28 .",
    "the numerical method to obtain the ground state configuration is based on the monte carlo simulation technique supplemented with the newton method in order to increase the accuracy of the energy .",
    "the latter technique is outlined and compared with the monte carlo technique in ref .",
    "the eigenmode frequencies are obtained from the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ground state configuration .",
    "the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix are the squared eigenfrequencies of the system .",
    "the eigenfrequencies are expressed in the unit @xmath31 .",
    "in this section we will discuss the numerically obtained ground state configurations for different powers of the confinement potential and show how they can be understood from earnshaw s theorem .",
    "[ groundstate ] shows as an example the ground state configurations for 40 particles for ( a ) a hard wall confinement ( i.e. @xmath32 ) , ( b ) a confinement with @xmath33 and finally ( c ) a parabolic confinement ( i.e. @xmath1 ) .",
    "one can see that in the case of hard wall confinement all particles are situated on one ring at the boundary of the potential .",
    "this is true for any number of particles in the system , also for clusters with many particles .",
    "when the confinement differs from the hard wall confinement , particles can be situated in the central region .",
    "notice that the density of particles for @xmath33 is much larger at the edge than in the central region , while for the parabolic confinement the density is uniform .     and ( c ) for a parabolic confinement .",
    "the scale is different in each figure , but the distance between the ticks is always one length unit.,width=325 ]     confinement potential and ( b ) a parabolic confinement potential.,width=309 ]    these observations can be understood from earnshaw s theorem  @xcite in two dimensions . since in the present case",
    "the inter - particle potential is logarithmic we can apply the 2d version of gauss s theorem @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the surface enclosed by @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the enclosed charge . now it is easy to show that charged particles on a 2d surface can not have a stable static equilibrium when they interact through a logarithmic potential ( i.e. the 2d coulomb potential ) .",
    "if we take a small circle anywhere in the 2d region with no enclosed charges , then , since the line integral of the field along the circle has to be zero , the number of outgoing lines of force are equal to the number of incoming ones .",
    "as long as there are outgoing lines of force , a charge left inside this circle can lower its energy by moving along it .",
    "thus in case of hard wall confinement , particles can not be in a stable static equilibrium if they are not in contact with the hard wall potential .",
    "our simulations indeed show that all particles are pushed on one ring situated at the boundary of the hard wall .",
    "this is different from the system with a hard wall confinement in which the particles interact through a @xmath2 potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that stable multiple ring structures can be found if a sufficiently large number of particles are present in the 2d system .",
    "as shown above the logarithmic interaction potential alone can not result in a stable multi - ring configuration .",
    "it is only possible if the hard wall confinement is changed into some soft wall @xmath0 confinement potential ( as shown in figs .",
    "[ groundstate](b ) and ( c ) ) . in this case , when a particle in the central region is moved in the outward radial direction , the restoring force is given by the confinement potential alone .",
    "this must balance the nonrestoring forces provided by the coulomb repulsion with the other particles . for the parabolic confinement case , this results in a uniform density as the restoring force is everywhere the same .",
    "corresponding to the highest frequency for @xmath33 . the breathing modes for @xmath38 in the case of a parabolic confinement.,width=325 ]    also",
    "the eigenmode spectrum for systems with a logarithmic interaction potential differs from all the previously studied cases .",
    "again the results can be understood from earnshaw s theorem .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of the system with logarithmic interaction for a @xmath33 confinement potential are , as an example for a soft wall confinement , shown in fig .",
    "[ freqs](a ) for @xmath39 up to 50 .",
    "notice that there is a pronounced highest frequency branch .",
    "we checked the corresponding eigenmodes and they all show the same behaviour : all outer particles move in the radial direction and have a large amplitude .",
    "an example of these breathing - like modes is shown in fig .",
    "[ modes](a ) for @xmath38 .",
    "it is interesting to look now at the eigenfrequencies in the case of a parabolic confinement potential , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ freqs](b ) .",
    "again the mode corresponding to the highest frequency is the breathing mode ( shown in fig .",
    "[ modes](b ) for @xmath38 ) .",
    "but , as the frequency of the breathing mode in the parabolic case is independent of the number of particles ( and given by @xmath40  @xcite ) , there is an upper bound for the frequencies .    for confinement potentials with @xmath41",
    "the potential is steeper than the parabolic confinement at large distances from the center .",
    "so for the confinement with @xmath41 a mode with larger velocities at the boundary than at the center overtakes the breathing mode to be the highest mode .",
    "but in all these modes there is a simultaneous contraction of a large number of particles so we can speak of breathing - like modes .",
    "normal modes are effectively a motion of free particles moving in a resultant potential created by the other particles and the confinement potential .",
    "so whenever we try to move a particle from its static equilibrium position , there are restoring forces that bring it back .",
    "then , addition of extra particles complicates the effective potential in which the individual particles are moving and creates higher normal modes . this potential can become steeper and steeper as more particles are added .",
    "this results in higher and higher normal modes . but this argument breaks down for the logarithmic interaction for which gauss s theorem can be applied : as already shown in previous section , the confinement potential is the only restoring force in the outward radial direction and forms an upper bound to the restoring force .",
    "addition of new particles does not create a more complicated effective potential but it can only result in a slight increase in the frequency of the breathing - like mode due to the increase of the nonrestoring coulomb force on the outer particles .",
    "as a function of the number of particles @xmath5 for a ) @xmath42 , b ) @xmath43 and c ) @xmath44.,width=325 ]     for a ) @xmath42 , b ) @xmath43 and c ) @xmath44.,width=476 ]     for a ) @xmath42 , b ) @xmath43 and c ) @xmath44 , and corresponding to the highest but one frequency for d ) @xmath42 , e ) @xmath43 and f ) @xmath44.,width=476 ]    as mentioned in the introduction , the logarithmic potential is sometimes a good model for the interaction between vortices in a type ii superconductor . in order to check how important small deviations from this logarithmic potential are",
    ", we also studied the spectrum of vortices in a type ii superconductor for a more generally valid interaction potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the interaction potential between vortices in a type ii superconductor is given by eq .",
    "( [ vs ] ) if the penetration length @xmath45 the coherence length . in the limit of @xmath46 , this potential reduces to the logarithmic potential studied in the previous sections .    the spectrum for the parabolically confined system is shown in fig  [ freqsvs ] for penetration lengths @xmath47 and 50 .",
    "one can clearly see that for @xmath42 no upper bound frequency is found , while it is for @xmath44 . that the logarithmic limit is not at all reached for @xmath42",
    "is also seen in fig .",
    "[ modesvs10 ] which shows the eigenmode corresponding to the largest frequency for @xmath48 .",
    "as shown above , this eigenmode corresponds with the breathing mode in case of a logarithmic interaction .",
    "this is not at all the case for @xmath42 and 10 ( see figs.[modesvs10](a ) and ( b ) ) , but for @xmath44 it does .",
    "therefore , transition to the logarithmic - type of interaction takes place between @xmath43 and 50 .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the eigenmodes corresponding to the highest frequency for @xmath49 ( see figs .  [ modesvs20](a - c ) ) .",
    "now the modes for @xmath47 and 50 look all similar .",
    "however , they differ from the breathing mode : the middle and outer ring move in the opposite direction . from the spectrum one can observe that for @xmath50 there are two highest frequencies which lie very close together . these highest but one frequencies are therefore plot in fig .",
    "[ modesvs20](d - f ) .",
    "notice that for @xmath43 and 50 this mode indeed corresponds with the breathing mode .",
    "we investigated the ground state structure and the spectral properties of a classical 2d cluster with a finite number of particles interacting through a repulsive logarithmic potential .",
    "the logarithmic potential is the coulomb potential in a 2d world .",
    "it was shown that for a hard wall confinement all particles are situated on one ring at the boundary of the potential , as a consequence of earnshaw s theorem in 2d .",
    "multi - ring configurations exist for soft confinement potentials in which case only the external confinement delivers the restoring force .",
    "the particles are uniformly distributed for a parabolic confinement .",
    "we also found that , independently of the number of particles in the cluster , all eigenfrequencies lie below the frequency of a particular mode , namely the breathing - like mode .",
    "this is again a consequence of earnshaw s theorem because adding extra particles does not create extra minima in the potential nor makes it more complex . in the case of a parabolic confinement",
    "the frequency of this breathing mode is independent from @xmath5 , which results in an upper bound for the frequencies .",
    "it is also shown that for vortices in a type ii superconductor ( for which the penetration length @xmath51 coherence length ) the transition to the logarithmic - type of interaction takes place between @xmath52 .",
    "it is not always the highest mode anymore which corresponds with the breathing mode , it can also be the highest but one mode ."
