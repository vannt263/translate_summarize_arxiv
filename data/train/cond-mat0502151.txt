    "the study of time series plays an important role in science due to their ubiquity in both natural and artificial systems .",

    "they comprise a sequentially ordered set of random variables , correlated or not , following a certain probability function . for the uncorrelated case ,",
    "the most perceptive is to consider the time series as a succession of values that are associated to the same probability distribution , like it occurs for the ordinary random walk , where probability of a certain jump value is constant in time .",
    "this kind of process is defined as _",
    "homoskedastic_. however , there are phenomena for which the probability distribution associated to the stochastic variable at some time step @xmath17 depends explicitly on @xmath17 and these are named _",
    "heteroskedastic_. a simple way to obtain a heteroskedastic process is to consider the same probability functional for all times , but with a varying second - order moment ( or width ) . in this sort of stochasticity",
    "we can include financial time series , namely return time series , where second - order moment time dependence is a feature more than well - known @xcite .",
    "aiming to mimic this type of systems , engle introduced in @xmath18 the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( @xmath19 ) ( @xmath20 will be defined later on ) process @xcite , which is considered a landmark in finance , comparable to the black - scholes equation @xcite , because of its wide use @xcite .",
    "albeit its extraordinary importance , engle s model presents , in some situations , implementation difficulties and above that , is not able to fully satisfactorily reproduce the empirically observed power - law like correlation decay of volatility .",
    "these failures lead t. bollerslev to generalise it defining the @xmath21 @xcite ( @xmath22 stands for _ generalised _ ) . due to its financial cradle",
    "these models are not well - known in physics , nevertheless they can be very useful to illustrate many traditional physical problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this manuscript",
    "we give sequence to the ansatz presented by us in a previous work @xcite for the @xmath23 process , generalising it to the @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , we detail the physical justification for why these models ( which present time dependent variance ) , accommodate well within the current nonextensive statistical mechanical theory",
    ". we also present an analytical form for the distribution for the ( squared ) volatility and analyse the degree of dependence between successive _ returns_.",
