    "discrete kinetic theory [ 1 - 2 ] with the thermostat assumption or diffuse scattering boundary condition [ 3 ] have been adopted to _ ad hoc _ model the many - particle scattering situation along the gas - surface interacting interface in a plane channel [ 1 ] .",
    "specific orientations relevant to different rarefaction parameters were identified therein [ 1 ] .",
    "motivated by the recent interests in the quantum boltzmann approach [ 4 ] and the relevant studies [ 5 - 8 ] , we continue our previous studies [ 1 ] by examining the related velocity and vorticity fields corresponding to those specific @xmath1 and kn we obtained and checking the special case @xmath2 .",
    "many interesting problems have been successfully solved [ 9 - 17 ] by using the discrete kinetic theory .",
    "carleman ( 1957 ) developed 2-velocity models which are defined by abstract properties in order to produce only mathematical purposes .",
    "that model was not constructed on the basis of detailed analysis of the collision mechanics [ 9 ] .",
    "broadwell ( 1964 ) devised a 6-velocity model to handle the simple shock wave problem [ 10 ] . at first mathematicians",
    "have been interested in the discrete boltzmann equation with the hope to provide , thanks to the relatively simpler structure of the equation as compared with that of the full boltzmann equation , stronger results than those available for the boltzmann equation or mathematical results suitable to be technically generalized to the full boltzmann equation in the analysis of initial and initial - boundary value problems .",
    "however , the analysis over recent years has shown that this is not the case [ 5,7 - 8 ] .",
    "these have been reviewed considering mainly the mathematical aspects of the initial and initial - boundary value problems in order to provide a `` more detailed '' analysis in a `` more specialized '' field .",
    "in fact the consistency of the mathematical results depends on the structure of the mathematical problems : in some cases it is possible to obtain for the discrete boltzmann equation `` stronger '' results than the corresponding ones for the boltzmann equation , and in other case `` weaker '' results .",
    "kawashima has proved the global existence of solutions to the initial - boundary value problems ( i .- b.v.p . ) for the discrete boltzmann equation in the 1d - region @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( cf [ 11 ] ) .",
    "cornille obtained some transient or stationary family of solutions for certain ( fixed - orientation ) discrete velocity models without considering the boundary conditions [ 12 ] . in this short paper , we plan to reconstruct the macroscopic velocity field of many dilute particles by the verified 4-velocity model [ 18 ] ( the free orientation is fixed to be @xmath5 ) considering a simple test problem : many molecules or particles flowing along the bounded - plane channel and finally reaching a steady state .",
    "the verification of our approaches has been done in [ 1,6 ] ( cf .",
    "chu ) , the argues about the differences between different discrete velocity models included . for @xmath2 case , using a completely different solving procedure , we obtained velocity fields which have a v - shaped or chevron - structure .",
    "this short note is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the general orientation - free [ 5,6 ] 4-velocity model in section 2 , and simplify it to a system of four equations for associated unknown functions .",
    "the general boundary conditions will be briefly introduced , too .",
    "then , we define some macroscopic variables ( like @xmath6 ) to suit our interest which is to find a class of steady ( and parallel ) non - boundary - driven solutions or flows for particles flowing along a microslab with bounded ( flat - plane ) walls . the orientation will be fixed as @xmath0 here when we solve the time - independent system of equations with relevant boundary conditions for the test case . as reported in",
    "[ 18 ] , there will be no dispersion or absorption when we implement the model with this orientation so that we can resolve sharp velocity profiles .",
    "these kinds of solutions , @xmath7 , which collect the main results of the present paper , are given in explicit form , and are functions of 1d coordinate : @xmath8 or @xmath9 and are also dependent on certain integration constants or parameters due to the purely diffuse reflection boundary conditions .",
    "finally , we analyze the solutions ( v - shaped fields ) and make some physical comments or discussions in comparison with the other flow - pattern selection due to the relative orientation effect upon binary encounter of many particles or unusual entropy production along the confined boundaries .",
    "considering a simple fluid of particles with mass @xmath10 and cross - sectional area @xmath11 , the first step of the modelling procedures consists in discretizing the velocity directions in a finite number of unit vectors @xmath12 , @xmath13 . one or more moduli are then associated to each direction .",
    "the ratio of the moduli has , however , to be properly chosen , so that collisions between particles with different velocity moduli are possible . for one velocity moduli case , @xmath14= @xmath15 , @xmath13 ; @xmath16 in general .",
    "normally @xmath17 is determined by the equilibrium distribution . the particles ( hard -",
    "sphere ) move in the whole space and collide by simple elastic collisions locally in space .",
    "the mathematical model is an evolutional equation for the number densities @xmath18 linked to the finite set of velocities @xmath14 .",
    "we write a balance equation for the number density of particles `` i '' in the form @xmath19 n_i = g_i -l_i\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the loss and the gain of the particles `` i '' due to collisions . in case of binary collisions",
    "an exact balance may be obtained , and is expressed with the transitional probabilities and the number densities .",
    "this model has the structure of a system of semi - linear partial differential equations of hyperbolic type . above equation",
    "could also be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 ; here , by definition , an @xmath24-collision ( @xmath25 ) involves @xmath24 particles .",
    "@xmath26=(@xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 = ( @xmath29 ) are two elements of @xmath30 , which is the set of @xmath24-not arranged numbers ( considering the combinations instead of the order they appear ) taken in the set @xmath31 .",
    "a `` transitional '' probability denoted by @xmath32 is associated to each @xmath24-collision @xmath33 . in the case of binary collisions ,",
    "this term ( also is called as the _ transition rates _ )",
    "is referred to the collisions @xmath34",

    "@xmath43 is ( positive or zero ) the number of indices @xmath45 present in the @xmath24-set .",
    "if only nonlinear binary collisions are considered and considering the evolution of @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 are admissible sets of collisions .",
    "we may then define the right - hand - side of above equation as @xmath49 with @xmath50 @xmath51 = @xmath31 , and the summation is taken over all @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are nonnegative constants satisfying @xmath54 : @xmath55 , @xmath56 : @xmath57 , @xmath58 : microreversibility condition .",
    "the conditions defined for the discrete velocity above requires that elastic , binary collisions , such that momentum and energy are preserved @xmath59 , @xmath60 , are possible for @xmath61 .",
    "the collision operator is now simply obtained by joining @xmath62 to the corresponding transition probability densities @xmath63 through @xmath64 = @xmath65 @xmath63 , where , @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the effective collisional cross - section . if all @xmath38 ( @xmath68 ) outputs are assumed to be equally probable , then @xmath63=@xmath69 for all @xmath70 and @xmath71 , otherwise @xmath63= 0 .",
    "the term @xmath72 is the volume spanned by the particle with @xmath14 in the relative motion w.r.t . the particle with @xmath73 in the time interval @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 @xmath76 is the number of @xmath77-particles involved by the collision in unit time .",
    "collisions which satisfy the conservation and reversibility conditions which have been stated above are defined as admissible collisions .",

    "there is no macroscopic flow [ 20 ] for many particles once the boundary conditions are selected above .",
    "otherwise , the velocity field ( from equation ( 11 ) ) as shown in figure 2 is qualitatively similar to the v - shaped or _ chevron_-like structure or pattern [ 21 ] reported before in other physical systems .",
    "the velocity field is tuned mainly by the kn and weakly by @xmath145 and @xmath146 with the latter due to the boundary conditions .",
    "we note that @xmath145 might depend on the physical properties of fluids and the geometry of the solid - wall as it comes from the gas - solid interaction or reflection .",
    "the flow - pattern selection mechanism is yet open to the best knowledge of the authors but might be partially linked to that reported in ref .",
    "[ 1,6 ] ( cf .",
    "chu ) since there will be an essential singularity when integrating equation ( 1 ) for @xmath2 case .",
    "in short , as kn increases , the chevron front becomes more flat .",

    "in fact , @xmath150 should depend on the detailed interactions of the gas - solid interface , like a kind of ( known ) molecules colliding with specific walls made of ( already ) specified material .",
    "it is bounded above but difficult to be fixed even for specific model and boundary value problem [ 11].our results for the vorticity field , at least , qualitatively matches with the hydrodynamic two - dimensional solution @xcite when the weakly compressible ( incompressible ) particles flow along a static flat - plane channel and finally reach a fully developed state even though the particles are initially driven by a constant pressure - gradient or unit forcing .",
    "interestingly , similar sharp flow fields of solitary wave profiles ( the highest one , cf . figs . 9 and 10 by wu _",
    "et al . _ in [ 22 ] ) and constant - v vortex was reported recently [ 22 ] in other physical system dealing with confined flow transports . to further interpret the mechanism , we propose that the complicated rate of entropy production along the boundaries ( cf . [ 23 - 24 ] )",
    "might favor the smearing of viscous diffusion ( toward the away - from - wall regions ) so that the sharp and strange pattern could form and then there is no significant smoothing of the profiles along the cross - section .",
    "note that , the approach here : firstly tracing or obtaining ( solving the corresponding equation in ( 3 ) ) each individual discrete number density ( @xmath151 ) then by summing up the corresponding projection to obtain @xmath7 , is different from that in [ 6 ] ( by chu ) : directly construct the macroscopic solutions from the relevant governing equation for macroscopic variables ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the boundary treatment which is relevant to the entropy production there is thus entirely different . the corresponding non - equilibrium states ( due to different rates of entropy production and their decay ) approaching to the final equilibrium states which are used as our boundary conditions",
    "might then be different .",
    "in fact , as we noticed , the argument raised in [ 24 ] could be applicable to present approach as evidenced in the boundary operator as expressed in equation ( 2 ) ( could be represented as similar divergence form ) .",
