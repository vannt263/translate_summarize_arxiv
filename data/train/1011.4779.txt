    "actually this kind of inequality has been used as a tentative _ definition _ of positive ricci curvature on more general , non - smooth spaces .",
    "the idea is that , in positive curvature , `` midpoints spread out '' so that the set of midpoints of two given sets is larger than in the reference euclidean case ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this led to the notion of _ displacement convexity of entropy _ for riemannian manifolds @xcite , later developed by sturm @xcite and lott and the second author @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how this fares for discrete spaces @xcite .",
    "another approach to define the ricci curvature of discrete spaces is _ coarse ricci curvature _ , developed by the first author @xcite .",

    "equivalently , @xmath67 with @xmath56 the uniform probability measure on @xmath0 .    here",
    "we use the _ @xmath68 wasserstein distance _ @xmath69 where the infimum is taken over all measures @xmath70 on @xmath71 such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 , i.e. , all couplings of @xmath52 and @xmath74 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more background on this topic .",
    "note that @xmath75 is always at least @xmath51 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 supported in sets @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; in particular , if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are taken uniform in @xmath30 and @xmath31 , theorem  [ thm : entropicbm ] is really a refinement of theorem  [ thm : bmcube ] .",
    "a first limitation of these results is the necessity to take @xmath45 .",
    "this comes from the combinatorial nature of our proof , which , for the most basic situation @xmath76 , consists in building an injection from @xmath77 into @xmath78 .",
    "this can probably be circumvented if we assume that the sets @xmath30 and @xmath31 are convex ( i.e.  the midpoint of two points in @xmath30 lies in @xmath30 , and likewise for @xmath31 ) : then , we can describe @xmath6-midpoints of @xmath30 and @xmath31 as iterated @xmath79-midpoints .",
    "( if @xmath30 or @xmath31 are not convex , iterating only yields midpoints of several points in @xmath30 and several points in @xmath31 , which is not what we want . )",
    "the injection from @xmath77 into @xmath78 used in our proof very naturally extends to an injection from @xmath77 into @xmath80 , with @xmath81 the set of @xmath6-midpoints .",
    "this leads to a lower bound for @xmath82 in terms of @xmath83 plus a curvature term .",
    "this also holds in the riemannian case ( by adding the brunn  minkowski inequality for @xmath6 and for @xmath84 ) .",
    "we do not know if there is a particular interpretation of this inequality .",
    "our initial goal was to prove that the discrete hypercube has positive ricci curvature in the sense of lott , sturm and the second author , i.e. , that the hypercube satisfies displacement convexity of entropy ( see below ) .",
    "the main difference with our result is that , in the brunn  minkowski inequality , we consider all midpoints of all pairs of points @xmath85 with law @xmath86 ; whereas for displacement convexity , one should first choose an optimal coupling between @xmath59 and @xmath60 and then only consider the midpoints of those pairs @xmath85 that make up the optimal coupling .",
    "the two properties coincide only when @xmath59 is a dirac measure , in which case our result is related to sturm s _ measure contraction property _ @xcite .",
    "so as far as we know , the problem of computing the ricci curvature of the hypercube using the displacement convexity approach is still open .",
    "we now present in more detail the two known approaches for ricci curvature on discrete spaces .",
    "this is not necessary to understand our results and proofs , but provides the original motivation .",
    "the basic idea of coarse ricci curvature is to take two small balls and compute the transportation distance between them .",
    "if this distance is smaller than the distance between the centers of the balls , then coarse ricci curvature is positive .",
    "this is formalized as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath87 be a metric space equipped with a measure @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath88 be a discretization parameter ( we take @xmath89 for a graph ) and assume that all @xmath88-balls in @xmath11 have finite and non - zero measure . for @xmath90 define the measure @xmath91 by restricting @xmath52 to the closed @xmath88-ball around @xmath92 : @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath92 and @xmath95 are two points in @xmath11 , then the _ coarse ricci curvature along @xmath96 _ is the number @xmath97 defined by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the @xmath68 wasserstein distance as defined earlier . if this is applied to a riemannian manifold , this gives back the ordinary ricci curvature when @xmath100 , up to scaling by @xmath101 .",
    "let us apply this to the discrete hypercube @xmath22 equipped with the uniform measure .",
    "the measure @xmath91 is uniform on the @xmath102 neighbors of @xmath92 ( counting @xmath92 itself ) . when @xmath92 and @xmath95 are neighbors , it is very easy to compute the curvature @xmath97 , as illustrated on figure  [ fig : riccicube ] .",
    "indeed , we have to move the @xmath102 neighbors of @xmath92 to the @xmath102 neighbors of @xmath95 ; out of these @xmath102 points , two are already in place ( @xmath92 and @xmath95 themselves ) and do not need to move , and the others have to move by a distance @xmath103 .",
    "so @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath92 and @xmath95 are not neighbors , we use a locality property of coarse ricci curvature .",
    "namely , if the space @xmath11 is @xmath106-geodesic ( i.e.  if the distance between two points is realized by a sequence of points with jumps at most @xmath106 ) , then it is enough to compute @xmath97 for @xmath107 ( exercise  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "a graph is @xmath103-geodesic by definition of the graph metric , so it is enough to work with neighbors .",
    "a lower bound on coarse ricci curvature comes with a number of consequences @xcite . for the discrete hypercube equipped with the uniform measure",
    "these properties were already known ( but not on the hypercube with e.g.  @xmath108 measures @xcite ) .    in general ,",
    "one may directly choose an arbitrary markov kernel @xmath91 ( without using a global measure @xmath52 ) ; this leads to interesting applications @xcite .      in @xcite ( following ideas from @xcite ) , renesse and sturm present a characterization of ricci curvature on riemannian manifolds , based on the idea that in positive curvature , `` midpoints spread out '' .",
    "let @xmath11 be a smooth , complete riemannian manifold .",
    "let @xmath109 be the riemannian volume measure on @xmath11 . given a probability measure @xmath52 on @xmath11 ,",
    "define its relative entropy as @xmath110 if the integral makes sense , or @xmath111 otherwise .",
    "let @xmath112 be the set of probability measures on @xmath11 with finite second moment , i.e.  those probability measures @xmath52 such that @xmath113 for some ( hence any ) point @xmath114 .",
    "on @xmath112 , the wasserstein distance @xmath115 is well - defined .",
    "moreover , @xmath112 equipped with the metric @xmath115 is a geodesic space : given any two probability measures @xmath116 , there exists a curve @xmath117 in @xmath112 with @xmath118 for @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "such a curve is called a _ displacement interpolation _ between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we refer to chapter  7 of @xcite for more details .",
    "theorem  1.1 in @xcite asserts that the riemannian manifold @xmath11 has ricci curvature at least @xmath120 if and only if the following inequality is satisfied : for any two measures @xmath121 , for any @xmath115-geodesic @xmath117 joining them , we have @xmath122 a property called _ displacement convexity _ of the entropy function .    for any probability measure",
    "@xmath52 we have @xmath123 , with equality when @xmath52 is uniform on its support .",
    "taking @xmath59 and @xmath60 to be uniform probability distributions on sets @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , we see that displacement convexity of entropy implies an inequality between the logarithms of the volumes of the support of @xmath124 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this inequality is very similar to the brunn  minkowski inequality mentioned earlier . actually , an important property of displacement interpolation is that the measure @xmath124 will charge only @xmath6-midpoints between the supports of @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( corollary  7.22 in @xcite , basically due to brenier and mccann ) , and so the brunn  minkowski inequality in a riemannian manifold really follows from convexity of entropy .",
    "displacement convexity of entropy makes sense in an arbitrary geodesic space . in @xcite , it is taken as the basis for a notion of ricci curvature in such spaces .",
    "the definition depends on two parameters @xmath12 ( the curvature ) and @xmath47 ( a `` dimension '' ) .",
    "displacement convexity of entropy as written here corresponds to @xmath125 , the simplest and weakest case .",
    "interestingly , this approach applies to spaces with positive curvature in the sense of alexandrov @xcite .",
    "application to discrete spaces requires some changes : for instance , in the case of the hypercube considered in this article , clearly if two points are at odd distance they do not have an exact midpoint , but they have an approximate midpoint up to an error term @xmath126 .",
    "such an approach is used in @xcite to define the brunn  minkowski inequality on discrete spaces . in @xcite , bonciocat and sturm use approximate midpoints in the space of probability measures to extend the definition of displacement convexity of entropy to discrete spaces , and",
    "provide examples of planar graphs satisfying this property . to our knowledge , these planar graphs are the only discrete examples so far .",
    "to make the idea clearer and introduce necessary concepts , we begin with a simplified version of theorem  [ thm : bmcube ] , namely the same statement with @xmath76 .",
    "so let @xmath127 be two nonempty subsets of the hypercube @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the set of midpoints of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we want to prove that @xmath128 or equivalently @xmath129    let @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "a midpoint @xmath132 of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a sequence of bits such that @xmath133 whenever @xmath134 and such that half the remaining bits coincide with those of @xmath33 and the other half with those of @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath135 be the number of distinct bits between @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for fixed @xmath33 and @xmath34 ,",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the midpoints @xmath35 of @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the subsets @xmath136 with cardinality @xmath137 ( if @xmath138 is even ) or @xmath139 ( @xmath138 odd ) : among the @xmath138 distinct bits between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the set @xmath140 describes those picked from @xmath33 in the construction of @xmath35 .",
    "we shall call _ @xmath138-crossover _ such a @xmath136 with @xmath141 .",

    "if @xmath140 is a crossover , we shall denote by @xmath143 its complement , which is also a crossover .",
    "note that , given a fixed @xmath38-crossover @xmath140 , the pair @xmath144 allows to recover @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , the identical bits in @xmath35 and @xmath145 are the same as in @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; the bits that differ between @xmath35 and @xmath145 also differ between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and knowledge of the crossover @xmath140 tells us exactly which of those come from @xmath33 or @xmath34 .    in particular , for each @xmath146 , let us define the @xmath138-crossover @xmath147 .",
    "then the map @xmath148 is an injection from @xmath77 to @xmath78 where @xmath42 is the set of midpoints of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "corollary  [ cor : crossoverseparation ] then states that the cardinality of @xmath234 is at most @xmath246 .",
    "since the cardinality of @xmath234 is also the cardinality of the fiber @xmath229 , this shows that the map @xmath247 is at most @xmath248-to - one .",
    "consequently , @xmath249 .",
    "setting @xmath250 , we have @xmath251 so that @xmath252 finally , summing over @xmath138 from @xmath103 to @xmath47 we find @xmath253 which proves theorem  [ thm : bmcube ] .",
    "we now turn to the proof of theorem  [ thm : entropicbm ] .",
    "remember that , given @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the hypercube @xmath11 , the midpoint measure @xmath61 is the uniform probability measure on all midpoints of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the midpoint measure of two probability measures @xmath254 and @xmath255 is defined as @xmath256 that is , the average of @xmath61 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are taken _ independently _ at random under @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "the proof follows the same lines as in the deterministic case , using probability measures instead of sets .",
    "the reader should think of the probability measures below as being nothing but weighted sets , and their shannon entropy as being the logarithm of their cardinality .",
    "the main differences are as follows :    * in the set - theoretic version , a key point was an estimation of the cardinality of the fibers of the map @xmath257 .",
    "the lower bound on the cardinality of the set @xmath258 followed . here",
    ", we will use the associativity of shannon entropy to express the same relationship , yielding a lower bound on the entropy of @xmath228 if the entropy of the fibers is known . *",
    "the final result involves @xmath259 instead of @xmath51 . in the set - theoretic version ,",
    "we used the map @xmath260 and the fact that @xmath261 to conclude that , if @xmath262 then @xmath263",
    ". then corollary  [ cor : crossoverseparation ] was used to bound the cardinality of the set @xmath234 of such crossovers @xmath140 in a fiber .",
    "the refined version uses the relation @xmath264 to turn any coupling between @xmath234 and @xmath265 , into a coupling between @xmath30 and @xmath31 with the same transportation distance .",
    "then , corollary  [ cor : crossoverw1sep ] is used as a refined version of corollary  [ cor : crossoverseparation ] and yields a bound on the entropy of the crossovers @xmath140 in a fiber .",
    "so let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be independent random variables with law @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "let as above @xmath155 be the set of @xmath138-crossovers .",
    "let @xmath140 be a random variable uniformly distributed on @xmath266 , independent of @xmath33 and @xmath34 conditionally to @xmath38 .",
    "let us define the random variables @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "thus the law of @xmath35 is @xmath269 , as is the law of @xmath145 .",
    "let us slightly abuse notation and denote by @xmath270 the shannon entropy of the law of a random variable @xmath95 .",
    "we have @xmath271 but since @xmath35 and @xmath145 have the same law @xmath269 , we get @xmath272    consider as above the map @xmath273 sending @xmath274 to @xmath152 .",
    "let @xmath275 be the law of @xmath274 knowing @xmath228 . by the associativity of entropy ,",
    "the shannon entropy of the law of @xmath228 is the entropy of the law of @xmath274 minus the average entropy of fibers of @xmath273 , namely : @xmath276    the first term is computed as follows .",
    "the random variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 are independent , and , conditionally to @xmath38 , the variable @xmath140 is independent of @xmath33 and @xmath34 with law the uniform distribution @xmath277 on @xmath266 .",
    "so @xmath278      let @xmath280 be the law of @xmath140 knowing @xmath228 ( i.e. , the third marginal of @xmath275 ) .",
    "given @xmath228 , the value of @xmath140 determines @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and so , @xmath281 i.e.   @xmath282 so that @xmath283      as in the set - theoretic case , we will show that @xmath280 has small shannon entropy by using concentration properties in the set of crossovers .",
    "corollary  [ cor : crossoverw1sep ] tells us that @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the image of @xmath280 by @xmath290 .",
    "thus , we need to evaluate the distance between @xmath280 and @xmath291 , as in the deterministic case .",
    "indeed , let us fix @xmath228 for now , and let @xmath293 and @xmath294 be the laws of @xmath33 and @xmath34 knowing @xmath228 , respectively . since @xmath153 and @xmath295 , any coupling between @xmath280 and @xmath291 determines a coupling between @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "moreover , since decoding is isometric by proposition  [ prop : codingmetric ] , these couplings will define the same transportation distance .",
    "so we get @xmath296 .",
    "if for each @xmath228 we are given a coupling between @xmath293 and @xmath294 , by summation this defines a coupling between @xmath254 and @xmath255 and so @xmath297 .",
    "thus @xmath298 . then , by convexity we get @xmath299 as announced .    putting everything together and using that @xmath300",
