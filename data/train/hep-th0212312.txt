    "superstring is the most promising candidate to describe a unified theory of all interactions , gravity included .",
    "there are five consistent superstring theories in 10 dimensions , which are connected among themselves through duality transformations .",
    "to each superstring theory , there is a corresponding supergravity theory in 10 dimensions .",
    "all of them can be obtained from the 11 dimensional supergravity theory .",
    "this indicates that those superstring theories are different manifestations of a unique 11 dimensional framework , that has been named @xmath2 theory  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the superstring type - iib can be recast in a more geometrical form in a 12 dimensional model , suggesting that perhaps a yet more fundamental framework may exist in 12 dimensions , which has been called @xmath1 theory  @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of superstring theories become relevant at energy scales comparable with the planck scale .",
    "this renders very improbable that superstring phenomenology may be tested in the near future in some laboratory experiment ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite in which the planck mass is lowered to tev scale by accounting for large extra dimensions ) .",
    "according to the hot big bang scenario , however , energy scales even as high as the usual planck scale ( @xmath3gev ) may have been reached in the very early universe .",
    "hence , for the moment , cosmology seems to be the most natural arena where the consequences of superstring theories may be tested .",
    "the pre - big bang paradigm  @xcite was one of the first ideas to implement superstring theories in this framework .",
    "some relics of a cosmological string phase may also be identified  @xcite , opening perhaps the possibility of testing superstring models .",
    "furthermore , superstring theories open the possibility that some typical drawbacks of the standard cosmological model , such as the existence of an initial singularity , may be solved in the context of superstring cosmological models .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show that , under certain conditions , it is possible to obtain completely regular bouncing cosmological models in the context of effective actions constructed from superstring theories ( not involving , in particular , negative energies  @xcite ) , for which , moreover , the dilaton is strictly positive ( nonvanishing ) at all times and never diverges .",
    "string cosmology is based on the low energy limit of string or superstring theories . in the most general case of the supersymmetric string theory , there are two sectors , related with the choice of periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions on the spinor fields , namely the ramond and neveu - schwarz ( ns ) sectors  @xcite",
    ". since fermions can be either left or right moving , this leads to four possible combinations of these sectors .",
    "the bosonic fields arise both from the ns - ns and ramond - ramond ( rr ) sectors .",
    "the ns - ns sector provides the einstein - hilbert term , as well as a three - form , called the axionic field , and the dilaton .",
    "the latter is directly related with the string perturbative expansion parameter and takes the form of a brans - dicke - like scalar field , nonminimally coupled to both the einstein - hilbert and the axionic fields . in the rr sector ,",
    "@xmath4 forms appear , which are minimally coupled to the dilaton field .",
    "the dimensions of the @xmath4 forms depend on the specific superstring theory which is under consideration . in cosmological applications ,",
    "we are interested in scalar fields that emerge from these different @xmath4 forms .",
    "they differ by the way they couple with the dilatonic field and between themselves .    out of the many different possibilities stemming from string theory",
    ", one can construct in general an effective action suitable for cosmological applications with two main features : scalar fields coming from the ns - ns sector and nonminimally coupled to the dilaton , and scalar fields from the rr sector which are minimally coupled to the dilaton .",
    "all the possibilities are not exhausted by these two frameworks , but they summarize the general aspects of what has been proposed in the literature as far as effective actions coming from string theory are concerned .",
    "one can also obtain phenomenological matter fields by averaging on some components of those original @xmath4 forms .",
    "this brief description explicits the great richness of the string effective action procedure , which implies a large variety of possible cosmological models .",
    "notice that these effective actions exhibit great similarities with those that can be obtained from multidimensional and supergravity theories . to select one cosmological model that could be a candidate to describe the physical world , two possible prescriptions",
    "are : either the cosmological model is completely regular , with no curvature or expansion parameter singularity , or it is compatible with observation ; ultimately , both criteria should be satisfied . in the present work we will concentrate on the first .",
    "the second criterion , which presents some specific challenges , will be treated in the future  @xcite .",
    "the search for singularity free cosmology in string theories is not a new subject  @xcite .",
    "the string action at tree level does not lead in general to singularity free cosmological solutions , at least when the strict string case ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the dilatonic coupling parameter ) is considered .",
    "the pre - big bang model  @xcite , which is an example of a string cosmology , requires the introduction of nonlinear curvature terms in order to achieve a smooth transition from a curvature growing phase to a curvature decreasing phase .",
    "if large negative values of the dilatonic coupling parameter @xmath6 are allowed , it is possible , in some cases , to obtain completely regular models , including in the dilatonic sector  @xcite .",
    "this may be achieved mainly in models with spatial sections with negative curvature .    here",
    ", it will be shown that regular cosmological models may also be obtained if a radiation fluid is coupled to the string action at the tree level .",
    "such a radiation fluid can have a fundamental motivation , for example , in the case of the superstring type iib theory , where a 5-form appears in the rr sector .",
    "truncation and dimensional reduction of this 5-form lead to a maxwell term in four dimensions with the desired features  @xcite .",
    "hence , the model to be studied here is totally based on superstring theories .",
    "the string motivated phenomenological term included under the form of a radiation fluid makes it possible to connect smoothly such string cosmological models to the radiation phase of the standard cosmological model before nucleosynthesis .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , models motivated by string theory similarly including a radiation fluid have been studied , restricted to flat spatial sections and @xmath7 . in such cases ,",
    "bouncing solutions have been obtained only for @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , for these solutions , the dilaton vanishes in the infinite past , raising doubts on the validity of the tree level action in such a region . in the present paper , the curvature of the spatial sections and the value of @xmath6",
    "are kept arbitrary .",
    "new bouncing regular solutions are then obtained , for which , as mentioned above , the dilaton remains finite and nonvanishing at all times .",
    "when @xmath9 , which includes the strict string case ( @xmath10 ) , the solutions can only be bouncing provided the spatial sections have negative curvature and if the dilaton is always negative , which is not consistent with the higher dimensional framework of stringlike theories , and implies a repulsive gravity .",
    "we shall henceforth disregard such solutions .",
    "when @xmath11 , the bouncing solutions are obtained for models with flat or negative curvature , and the dilaton is strictly positive at all times .    in the following section ,",
    "we derive effective string motivated actions in four dimensions .",
    "in particular , we show how to obtain an effective string action in four dimensions with @xmath11 in the context of the so - called @xmath1 theory in twelve dimensions . in sec .",
    "iii we derive nonsingular cosmological solutions from these effective theories , which are thoroughly discussed in sec .",
    "iv from the point of view of violation of energy conditions .",
    "we end up with the conclusions in sec . v.",
    "our analysis is based on the following effective action at tree level : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dilatonic field , @xmath14 is the axionic field , and @xmath6 is the dilatonic coupling constant .",
    "the two last terms come from the rr sector of superstring type iib .",
    "the tildes indicate that all quantities are considered in a @xmath15-dimensional spacetime , @xmath16 in the pure superstring context .    the dilatonic coupling constant is @xmath17 for usual superstring theory",
    ". however , this may not necessarily be the case for some ten dimensional theories stemming from a more fundamental one in higher dimensions . in some specific situations",
    ", the value of @xmath6 can be found to be even less than @xmath18 . as an example",
    ", the superstring type iib action may be reformulated in 12 dimensions , in the context of the so - called @xmath1 theory .",
    "a low energy limit of the @xmath1 theory has been studied by  @xcite , where an action in 12 dimensions has been established , which was shown to lead to the low energy limit of the superstring type iib in 10 dimensions through truncation and dimensional reduction .",
    "let us consider this twelve dimensional action , given by  @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 being a coupling parameter for the chern - simons type term involving the potentials of the five and four - forms . writing the metric as @xmath23 with greek indices @xmath24 running from 0 to 9 and latin indices @xmath25 $ ] , and setting the five - form equal to zero , we obtain the following lagrangian @xmath26 where we have retained just the two and three - forms coming from the four - form in the original action .",
    "the term originating the three - form was made purely imaginary in 12 dimensions .",

    "this is a remarkable example of how an effective string action with @xmath31 ( in this case , @xmath32 ) can be realized .",

    "we shall also call @xmath41 the rr - scalar as it originates from the same sector .    the lagrangian described by eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) may cover theories others than pure string theory .",

    "this less restrictive coupling contains the string case if one sets @xmath44 , but general multidimensional theories and supergravity theories in higher dimensions are examples where the parameter @xmath43 may take different values . as was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the final results depend very weakly on the parameter @xmath43 and one may thus expect that this generalized effective action will give results that are essentially similar to those obtained in the pure string case .",
    "hence , the results presented below are of a quite general nature , and should not be understood as statements restricted to string cosmology only , even though they were derived in this specific framework .    from eq .",

    "the bouncing solutions with @xmath239 and positive dilaton still present some sort of trans - planckian problem as long as the string expansion parameter diverges initially and one must go beyond the tree level action in such cases .",
    "notice that , in the cases where the dilaton is strictly positive , the initial value of the dilatonic field can be made smaller than its final value .",
