    "of all high @xmath3 processes at a hadron collider , qcd processes have the largest cross - section .",
    "large data samples accumulated by the cdf and d0 detectors in runii allow precise measurements of the shapes of the observables that describe standard model qcd processes .",
    "therefore deviations from the standard model could be easily detected .",
    "the top quark , due to its large mass , that is not yet understood , may have a special connection with the electroweak symmetry breaking and new physics . at tevatron",
    "the @xmath0 pairs are predominantly produced via the s - channel gluon annihilation .",
    "however this may not be the only production mechanism .",
    "a new neutral heavy particle produced in a proton - antiproton collision would decay into @xmath0 , adding a resonant component to the standard model spectrum .",

    ", cdf looked for a bump in the invariant mass spectrum with 1.13 fb@xmath1 , while d0 exploited the shapes of dijet angular distributions with 0.7 fb@xmath1 . in the @xmath0 final state",
    "there is one analyses by d0 with 2.1 fb@xmath1 , and three analyses by cdf with 0.96  @xcite , 0.68  @xcite , and 1.9 fb@xmath1 respectively .",
    "important aspect of the @xmath0 analyses is the reconstruction of top - antitop invariant mass .",
    "d0 uses direct mass reconstruction , without constraint fit .",
    "cdf analyses employ tempate method , matrix method , and dynamic likelihood method , respectively .",
    "analyses by both cdf and d0 @xmath0 use lepton+jets final state .",

    "events with dijet masses above 180 gev are selected .",
