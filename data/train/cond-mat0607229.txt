    "the dynamics of elastic objects driven by an external force in disordered media has attracted considerable theoretical and experimental interest during the last years @xcite .",
    "the reason is twofold . on one hand , elastic objects in disordered media",
    "exhibit the rich behavior of glassy systems and thus their study can help us to understand the physics of more complex systems such as spin glasses  @xcite or random field systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the motion of elastic objects in disordered media is an adequate description of many experimental systems .",
    "one can divide these systems into two classes .",
    "the first class comprises periodic systems , the most prominent examples being charge density waves ( cdw ) in solids .",
    "these start sliding when the applied electric field becomes large enough @xcite .",
    "vortex lines in disordered superconductors form a quasi - ordered periodic brag glass phase @xcite .",
    "the second class includes propagating interfaces such as domain walls in magnetically or structurally ordered systems @xcite , interfaces between inmiscible fluids in porous media @xcite or dislocation lines in metals @xcite . to unify the mathematical description of these different systems",
    "one uses the notion of `` manifolds '' . in all these systems the interplay between quenched disorder and elasticity leads to a complicated response of the system to an applied external force . at zero temperature",
    ", a driving force @xmath0 exceeding a certain threshold value @xmath1 is required to set the elastic manifold into motion .",
    "this depinning transition shares many features with critical phenomena @xcite : characteristic lengths diverge close to the transition as @xmath2 and the system becomes extremely sensitive to small perturbations . following the description of standard critical phenomena , one can identify the ordered phase with the moving phase with force @xmath3 , and the order parameter with the velocity @xmath4 which vanishes as @xmath5 at the transition .",
    "one also introduces the dynamic exponent @xmath6 which relates time and space by @xmath7 .",
    "the critical force @xmath1 , which must be tuned to reach the scale - invariant regime , plays a role similar to the critical temperature in thermal phase transitions .",
    "there are many subtleties however within this analogy , since depinning is a non - equilibrium transition at zero temperature , where quenched disorder dominates . as the corresponding static problem of elastic manifolds in disordered media @xcite , the depinning problem suffers from two peculiarities , when compared to standard critical phenomena : first an infinite set of operators becomes relevant simultaneously below the internal upper critical dimension @xmath8 .",
    "second , their study is more difficult due to the dimensional reduction phenomenon , which renders naive zero - temperature perturbation theory trivial , hence useless .",
    "the way out involves first parameterizing the set of relevant operators into a function , @xmath9 , the second cumulant of the random pinning force .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the corresponding functional renormalization group ( frg ) provides an adequate description of the depinning transition if one considers the non - analytic renormalized function @xmath9 .",
    "it was shown only recently that the frg can be unambiguously extended to higher loop order and that the underlying non - analytic field theory is renormalizable @xcite .",
    "the frg equation for @xmath9 has two main non - trivial stable fixed points which describe periodic and interface universality classes .",
    "both of them exhibit a cusp singularity of the form @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding critical exponents have been computed to second order in @xmath11 @xcite .    despite this progress",
    "many open questions remain . among them",
    "is the problem of sample - to - sample fluctuations , i.e.  the probability distributions of a given observable and their relation to extreme value statistics .",
    "these were studied mostly for static quantities .",
    "the distribution of the energy of pinned manifolds was analyzed in ref .",
    "the distribution of the mean squared width of an interface at the depinning transition was calculated using a gaussian approximation for the displacement field , yielding a result quite close to numerics @xcite .",
    "it was shown how systematic corrections can be computed in the field theory of depinning within an @xmath12 expansion @xcite .",
    "one expects sample - to - sample fluctuations to play an important role in the dynamics too , leading to a broad distribution of time scales .",
    "the divergence of the typical energy barrier with scale , responsible for the ultraslow creep motion , is predicted by phenomenological arguments @xcite . a numerical study in ref .",
    "@xcite of the distribution of barriers confirms that the typical barrier scales as the energy minima , as predicted by 1-loop frg studies @xcite .",
    "the more difficult question of predicting the distribution of energy barriers was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the frg , and in ref .",
    "@xcite using extreme value statistics .",
    "an important and debated question is to characterize the finite - size fluctuations of the critical force and whether they obey finite - size scaling ( fss ) .",
    "similar questions were investigated recently in the context of heteropolymer unbinding transitions ( the role of critical force being played there by critical temperature ) where violation of fss was found @xcite . in the depinning problem ,",
    "one difficulty is to define properly the critical force and its fluctuations in the limit of large interface ( internal ) size @xmath13 .",
    "a recent and efficient algorithm @xcite allows to obtain exactly the critical force @xmath1 of an interface in a periodic medium of period @xmath14 ( i.e.  a cylinder ) , as well as the so - called critical configuration .",
    "the latter is defined as the last blocking configuration as @xmath0 is increased up to @xmath1 , which also defines @xmath15 .",
    "one can refer to this definition as an extremal configuration in a given sample .",
    "the finite - size sample - to - sample distribution of @xmath16 was computed numerically @xcite and found to depend on the aspect ratio @xmath17 of the cylinder .",
    "this should be expected since for large @xmath18 one recovers a zero - dimensional problem and the interface will be blocked by rare disorder configurations , hence dominated by extremal statistics .",
    "however this results seems to depend on the precise definition and one may ask whether a more fundamental definition exists , with no need to specify a value for @xmath18 .",
    "an alternative approach is to define the observables at the depinning transition as the time average in the moving state at fixed velocity @xmath4 , in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "this definition , to which we refer as the quasi - static depinning limit , is usually associated to the frg approach of the depinning transition .",
    "observables calculated in this approach must , a priori , be distinguished from those computed in the critical configuration . since the time average",
    "is usually performed in a steady state , to avoid dominance by history dependence , it also requires specifying boundary conditions .",
    "it is widely believed that both approaches give the same result , at least for ( @xmath20 component ) interfaces , since in the limit of infinite systems ( @xmath21 ) all quasi - static configurations should have the same statistical properties and the critical force @xmath1 should be self - averaging .",
    "however it is less clear how these approaches compare when applied to finite - size fluctuations where the dispersion in local pinning forces becomes important .    in the present paper",
    "we study the distribution of the threshold forces by means of the functional renormalization group . within the field theory",
    "we propose two definitions of the critical force @xmath22 in finite size @xmath13 and show that they are identical to one loop in the renormalized theory .",
    "we compute the cumulants of @xmath22 and extract the distribution which is found to be universal , up to a shift in @xmath0 ( the critcal force @xmath23 ) and one scale - parameter ( the width of the distribution ) . all results are valid within the @xmath12 expansion and extrapolations to low dimension are discussed . the critical force studied here",
    "is defined from a fixed center of mass ensemble .",
    "as we point out it can be , in principle , obtained in numerics .",
    "since it does not refer to any transverse size @xmath14 , it is more fundamental than the one used in the numerical studies on a cylinder . we discuss how the latter one can in principle be recovered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec1 ] introduces the model and the frg treatment of the depinning transition . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we compute the bare distribution of threshold forces to one - loop order using an improved perturbation theory , and renormalize it for the case of an elastic interface . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss the renormalization for periodic systems . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss the relation between the distribution of critical forces , in the quasi - static limit , and in the critical configuration .",

    "the configuration of the manifold can be described by a scalar displacement field @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the @xmath26 dimensional internal coordinate of the manifold .",
    "we study the over - damped dynamics of a manifold in the disordered medium which obeys the following equation of motion @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the bare friction and @xmath29 the elasticity .",
    "the quenched random force @xmath30 can be chosen gaussian with zero mean and variance @xmath31 for periodic systems the function @xmath9 is periodic , while for interfaces it decays exponentially for large @xmath32 . in the latter case , in contrast to the statics , at depinning both random bond ( rb ) and random field ( rf ) microscopic disorder renormalize to the same fixed point , which has rf characteristics , so that we can restrict ourselves to the latter case .",
    "@xmath33 is the width of the function @xmath9 . to make the problem well - defined we imply an uv cutoff at scale @xmath34 .",
    "we consider a finite system of size @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the size @xmath13 serves as an ir cutoff i.e.   it plays the role of the mass in the corresponding field theory .",
    "one can easily see that due to the tilt symmetry the elastic constant remains uncorrected to all orders so that we are free to fix @xmath35 .",
    "below , starting in section [ sec2 ] we will find it convenient to work in the comoving frame . to that end",

    "it is known that naive perturbation theory , obtained by taking for @xmath55 an analytic function exhibits the property of dimensional reduction and fails to describe the physics , giving for example an incorrect roughness exponent .",
    "the physical reason for this is the existence of a large number of metastable states .",
    "let us briefly sketch the frg analysis of the system under consideration .",
    "power counting shows that the whole function @xmath9 becomes relevant below @xmath56 and thus one has to renormalize the whole function . to extract the scaling behavior one has to study the flow of the renormalized function @xmath55 under changing the ir cutoff towards infinity .",
    "various choices for the ir cutoff were discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "a convenient choice is to add a small mass @xmath57 , so that the scaling behavior can be extracted from the effective action @xmath58 $ ] of the theory as @xmath57 decreases to zero .",

    "the renormalized correlator is singular and perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "nevertheless , the flow tends to a non - trivial fixed - point ( fp ) solution @xmath70 with a new value for the roughness exponent which controls the large - scale behavior .",
    "there are two fps which describe interfaces and periodic systems correspondingly .",

    "this term is analogous to the critical temperature shift in the @xmath78 theory , and gives the critical threshold force @xmath79 .",
    "it is zero in the bare theory .",
    "we expect that in the limit of an infinite system @xmath21 , the critical force becomes sample independent if there is the same distribution of disorder in each sample and thus @xmath80 .",
