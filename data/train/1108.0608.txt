    "the question whether and how a given function can be expressed approximately by polynomials are of great importance in theory as well as in practice . for example , by definition , an explicit , finite formula is unavailable for transcendental functions , and instead , an appropriate polynomial approximation is chosen to replace the function . because polynomials , particularly the ones of low order , are easy to manipulate , this approach provides computational speed with minimal penalty in accuracy .    a natural candidate for polynomial approximation",
    "is a truncated taylor expansion , typically at the midpoint of the interval where the approximation is most accurate .",
    "taylor s theorem and the weierstrass approximation theorem @xcite asserts the possibility of local approximation of an arbitrary function @xmath0",
    ". moreover , the approximation accuracy improves as the degree of the polynomial increases .",
    "however , this improvement comes at the expense of complexity and computational speed .",
    "this expense can be substantially reduced if the function can be approximated to the same accuracy with a lower degree polynomial .    here",
    ", we show analytically that an arbitrary function can be approximated via legendre polynomials using _ non - uniformly _ spaced points on an interval as the input , and that at least for some functions , approximation with legendre polynomials yields a substantially higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to taylor expansion of the same order ( i.e. , with the same number of non  zero coefficients ) .",
    "we further demonstrate the improvement in accuracy over taylor expansion numerically , using the sine , exponential , and entropy functions .",

    "the formula for the slope in a linear regression @xmath2 for uniformly spaced continuous points @xmath3 over the interval @xmath4 $ ] is given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes the expectation of @xmath3 . because @xmath3 is uniform in",

    "equation  [ eq : slope-2 ] allows estimation of the instantaneous slope over not just the points that are uniformly spaced , but all points in the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "this result for estimation of the slope is far more general .",
    "it provides a least squares polynomial approximation to an arbitrary function on the interval @xmath4 $ ] . to see this , consider the shifted legendre polynomials of order @xmath15 , defined by rodrigues formula @xcite :    @xmath16}(x ) & = & \\dfrac{1}{2^{n}n!}\\dfrac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}}\\left(1-\\left[\\dfrac{2x - a - b}{b - a}\\right]^2\\right)^{n}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\dfrac{1}{n!(b - a)^{n}}\\dfrac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}}\\left[\\left(b - x\\right)(x - a)\\right]^{n } \\label{eq : rodrigues}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which are orthogonal functions with respect to the @xmath17 inner product    @xmath18},p_{m,[b , a]}>=\\dfrac{b - a}{2n+1}\\delta_{nm}\\label{eq : innerprod}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 denotes the kronecker delta , equal to @xmath20 if @xmath21 and to @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "furthermore , legendre polynomials of order @xmath20 to @xmath15 are the same as the orthogonal polynomials obtained by the gram - schmidt process on the polynomials @xmath23 with respect to the inner product given by equation  [ eq : innerprod ] up to a constant multiplication factor @xcite .",
    "therefore , by adding the basis functions @xmath24 , we obtain the @xmath25order polynomial fit to an arbitrary function @xmath26 on the interval @xmath4 $ ] as    @xmath27}>}{<p_{n,[b , a]},p_{n,[b , a]}>}p_{n,[b , a]}\\label{eq : polyfit}\\ ] ]    by completing the sum of squares , the expected integrated squared residual error for equation  [ eq : polyfit ] can be written as    @xmath28}>^{2}}{\\left\\|p_{n,[b , a]}\\right\\|^{2}}\\right)\\label{eq : isre}\\ ] ]    the term @xmath29}>}{<p_{n,[b , a]},p_{n,[b , a]}>}$ ] in equation  [ eq : polyfit ] has a simple and telling interpretation .",

    "the integral in equation  [ eq : legendre ] can be solved using integration by parts , and none of the boundary terms appear in the solution because @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . moreover ,    @xmath34 } > = \\dfrac{(b - a)^{n}(-1)^{n}n!}{(2n+1)!}e_{\\beta(n+1,n+1;a , b)}\\left[\\dfrac{d^{n}y}{dx^{n}}\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is a beta probability distribution with @xmath36 degrees of freedom , shifted and scaled so that it lies on the interval @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath38 is the expected value with respect to this distribution .",
    "therefore , the contribution of each of the @xmath39order legendre polynomial to the residual error for equation  [ eq : polyfit ] ( shown in equation  [ eq : isre ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath40}>^{2}}{\\left\\|p_{n,[b , a]}\\right\\|^{2}}=\\left[\\dfrac{(b - a)^{2n-1}}{(2n+1)!{2n \\choose n}}\\right]\\left(e_{\\beta(n+1,n+1;a , b)}\\left[\\dfrac{d^{n}y}{dx^{n}}\\right]\\right)^{2}\\label{eq : legendre-2}\\ ] ]    equation  [ eq : legendre-2 ] is analogous to the taylor expansion , and uses a scaled value of the expected value of the @xmath25 derivative in the expansion .",
    "note that the distribution @xmath41 is a parabola raised to the @xmath25 power and scaled to integrate to 1 ,",
    "so it rapidly approximates @xmath42 . the mean and the variance of the distribution @xmath43 is given by @xmath44    and the entire series ( equation  [ eq : polyfit ] ) takes the form    @xmath45}{n!{2n \\choose n}}(b - a)^{n-1}\\right]p_{n,[b , a]}\\label{eq : legendre_series}\\ ] ]    the series in equation  [ eq : legendre_series ] converges much more rapidly than the taylor series because the coefficient @xmath46 converges to zero much more rapidly than the analogous term @xmath47 in taylor series .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath48 for arbitrary constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 , it is easy to show ( by stirlings formula and by the nature of legendre functions ) that the squared norm of the @xmath25 term is bounded above by    @xmath51^{2}!}^{2}\\approxeq\\dfrac{k^{2}\\alpha^{2n}e^{2n}(b - a)^{2n-1}}{16^{n}n^{4n}}=\\dfrac{k^{2}}{(b - a)}\\left(\\dfrac{\\alpha^{2}e^{2}(b - a)^{2}}{16n^{4}}\\right)^{n}\\label{eq : conv_bound}\\ ] ]    note that the multiplier of the numerator , but not that of the denominator , of equation  [ eq : conv_bound ] is bounded .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the first term of the series in equation  [ eq : legendre_series ] .",
    "if we choose its order , @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 , then the squared norm of each successive term @xmath55 has a norm    @xmath56    for @xmath57 .",
    "this shows that the sum of squares of the terms after the @xmath58 term is at most twice the size of the previous term , and the series is dominated by a geometric sequence with a decay constant @xmath59 . because one can start with any arbitrary @xmath60",
    ", the upper bound of the absolute value of @xmath61 term ( equation  [ eq : conv_bound ] ) can be reduced arbitrarily by simply increasing the number of terms , @xmath15 .",
    "demonstrating convergence in absolute value is also simple because the legendre polynomials are normalized so that they are bounded by one .",
    "the bound , equivalent to that in equation  [ eq : conv_bound ] , for the maximum of the @xmath25 term is given as :    @xmath62!}\\approxeq\\dfrac{k\\alpha^{n}(b - a)^{n-1}e^{n}}{\\sqrt{2}(4)^{n}n^{2n}}=\\dfrac{k}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\dfrac{\\alpha(b - a)e}{(4)n^{2}}\\right)^{n}\\ ] ]    this bound also indicates that for the same @xmath63 ( as above ) , the maximum norm of each successive term is again less than @xmath64 .",
    "similar to above , for large @xmath63 , the absolute value of the terms @xmath65 is less than twice the absolute value of the term @xmath63 , which can be arbitrarily small .",
    "thus , the legendre polynomial expansion converges at a very rapid rate .",
    "there is no simple computable remainder ( corresponding to the one in taylor series expansion ) in legendre polynomial approximation , but only bounds ( see above ) .",
    "therefore , we demonstrate the improvement in accuracy via an empirical approach using three representative transcendental functions : the sine function ( @xmath66 ) , the exponential function ( @xmath67 ) , and the entropy of a bernoulli trial ( @xmath68 ) in the interval @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "note that all three functions satisfy the boundedness condition @xmath48 above .",
    "for comparison , we approximate the functions with taylor and legendre polynomials using at most six non - zero coefficients ( figure  [ fig : tayvslagfit ] ) .",
    "because the sine function has odd symmetry about @xmath70 and the entropy function @xmath71 is odd , the expansions of these function involve , respectively , polynomial degrees of 11 and 10 of even and odd order .",
    "we estimate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr , in decibels ) for approximations as    @xmath72    to quantify the accuracy in approximation ( table  [ tab : impr ] ) .",
    ".signal - to - noise ratios ( in decibels ) for the taylor ( t ) and legendre ( l ) polynomial approximations .",
    "note the higher snr for the legendre polynomial approximation .",
    "the accuracy of legendre polynomial approximation is significantly greater than that of taylor approximation of equal order . [",
    "tab : impr ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     consistent with the theoretical considerations in above , these results show a rapid convergence of legendre polynomials for increasing number of polynomial coefficients , and an improved accuracy compared to taylor polynomials of the same order .",
    "note that using six coefficients , even the least improvement ( in the case of the exponential function ) is 21.59 decibels ( which amounts to an average error for the legendre approximation 0.087 times the error for the taylor approximation ) .",
    "the approximation for the sine function leads to an improvement of 63.18 decibels ( that is , the error the legendre approximation is 0.0007 times as that for the taylor approximation on average ) .",
    "note in figure  [ fig : tayvslagfit ] that while the taylor polynomial approximation has maximum accuracy at the midpoint , legendre polynomial approximation distributes the error more uniformly throughout the entire interval . as a result ,",
    "the squared error of is smaller and the snr is larger in case of legendre polynomials .",
    "our analytical and numerical results show that legendre polynomials can substantially improve the speed and accuracy of function approximation compared to taylor polynomials of the same order .",
    "the fast convergence of legendre polynomials was noted in a prior study @xcite , but the geometric convergence in norm has not been shown analytically before .",
    "the geometric convergence rate is consistent with the general result of srivastava @xcite on the relation of the generalized rate of growth of an entire function to the rate of uniform convergence of a polynomial approximation on an arbitrary infinite compact set . and",
    ", it should be noted that the geometric convergence is not possible in general for @xmath73 approximants if @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "thus , approximation using legendre polynomials can provide significant performance improvements in practical applications .",
    "we also showed that legendre polynomials has the additional advantage that an arbitrary function can be approximated using _ non - uniformly _ spaced points on a given interval .",
    "importantly , its accuracy of approximation is substantially higher than that of the taylor expansion with the same order of polynomials , with a uniform error distribution across the entire interval .",
    "therefore , legendre expansion , instead of taylor expansion , should be used when global accuracy is important .",
