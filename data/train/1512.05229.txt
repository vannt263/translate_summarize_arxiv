    "historically , the investigation of su(2 ) quantum spin chains has been a great source of inspiration for theoretical physics .",
    "besides bethe s solution of the @xmath3 spin chain , one of the most notable achievements in this context was haldane s discovery that the physical properties of the su(2 ) heisenberg model in one dimension depend crucially on the type of spin that is used.@xcite for half - integer spins the system can easily be shown to be gapless@xcite while for integer spins it has been conjectured to develop a gap , the so - called haldane gap , while preserving translation invariance.@xcite this conjecture triggered a tremendous amount of work before it could be confirmed for various values of the spin using analytical and numerical approaches , or even in experiment.@xcite    the gapped phase of su(2 ) spin chains with unique translation invariant ground state which arises for integer spin representations is nowadays commonly called the haldane phase . as has been understood only recently",
    ", it provides a paradigmatic example of a symmetry protected topological phase.@xcite this means that its ground state can not be transformed into a trivial product state except if either the relevant symmetry is broken or the system undergoes a phase transition .",
    "the symmetries that qualify for the protection of the haldane phase are @xmath4 , its dihedral subgroup @xmath5 , time - reversal or space inversion .",
    "the prototypical example for a hamiltonian and a ground state which reside in the haldane phase is provided by the aklt construction , named after its protagonists affleck , kennedy , lieb and tasaki.@xcite it provides the first realization of what these days is commonly referred to as a matrix product state .",
    "the study of haldane phases reaches a new level of complexity for spin systems with higher rank symmetries such as su(n ) .",
    "in contrast to su(2 ) there are now up to @xmath2 haldane phases.@xcite in each of them the ground state , which is assumed to be unique , is characterized by a distinct @xmath6-valued non - zero topological quantum number .",
    "the latter can be measured in terms of a non - local string order parameter@xcite and it is also reflected in the nature of emergent fractionalized boundary spins which arise if the system is studied with open boundary conditions.@xcite information about the topological class of the system can also be inferred by looking at certain berry phases@xcite or at the behavior of specific @xmath7 subgroups of @xmath0.@xcite    since the classification of su(n ) haldane phases and the proof of existence in ref .   were based on abstract principles , the article did not give a detailed prescription for how to realize them in the phase diagram of concrete spin models with specific physical su(n ) spins . the first systematic attempt to overcome this deficiency took place in ref .   where a one - dimensional cut through the phase diagram of a su(3)-invariant system with spins transforming in the eight - dimensional adjoint representation was studied .",
    "along this line of interpolation a topological phase transition was observed which connects the two distinct su(3 ) haldane phases with topological quantum number @xmath8\\in{\\mathbb{z}}_3 $ ] .",
    "the phase diagram of this model was then further explored in ref .  .",
    "another concrete proposal , now with su(n ) spins transforming in the so - called `` self - conjugate '' representation , was provided in ref .  .",
    "the definition of this representation is bound to even values of @xmath1 and the associated haldane phase is characterized by the topological quantum number @xmath9\\in{\\mathbb{z}}_n$ ] .",
    "further investigations illuminated various complementary aspects of this model.@xcite however , what is still lacking to date is a systematic construction of su(n ) haldane phases which is valid for general values of @xmath1 .    the main goal of our current paper is to close this gap and to provide explicit realizations of the four elementary non - trivial haldane phases with topological quantum numbers @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] ( regarded as elements of @xmath6 ) . following the ideas of ref .",
    "we choose to work with physical su(n ) spins transforming in the adjoint representation .",
    "we then construct aklt states whose auxiliary spins transform in either the ( anti-)fundamental or the rank-2 anti - symmetric representation and we determine the associated parent hamiltonians .",
    "moreover , we also confirm the existence of a mass gap . for the special case su(4 ) , our construction leads to a realization of the complete set of three haldane phases in a single phase diagram .",
    "aklt models for su(n ) attracted some attention@xcite even before realizing the intimate connection to the developing field of symmetry protected topological phases . which is based on auxiliary @xmath11 spins .",
    "] also our current setup with an aklt state based on the adjoint representation and with auxiliary spins in the ( anti-)fundamental representation already received a thorough treatment in the past .",
    "however , the authors of ref .",
    "( and later also those of ref .  ) have been satisfied with writing down a hamiltonian which exhibits spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking . in this case",
    ", there are two ground states which both possess a simple aklt form .",
    "the two states are related by an exchange of auxiliary spins and correspondingly space inversion maps one into the other .    from the perspective of the general classification@xcite these systems , however ,",
    "do not reside in a well - defined pure haldane phase but rather in a superposition of two different ones which are distinguished by their topological quantum numbers .",
    "our current analysis resolves this degeneracy by incorporating suitable terms in the hamiltonian which explicitly break inversion symmetry while preserving su(n ) .",
    "the precise form of the desired hamiltonian is derived using a powerful diagrammatic method called `` birdtracks''.@xcite the same technique also gives straightforward access to the eigenvalues of the ground states transfer matrix which , in turn , determine entanglement spectrum , spin - spin correlation functions and correlation length .    another important outcome of our diagrammatic approach is a new type of universal parent hamiltonian . while not a projector in general , it has the great advantage of having an extremely simple graphical ( tensor ) form .",
    "our analysis paves the way to a more detailed study of the phase diagram of su(n ) spin chains , including topological phase transitions . according to a recent proposal by furuya and oshikawa , the notion of symmetry protection",
    "is not only restricted to gapped phases but can also be used to characterize critical points.@xcite specifically it leads to selection rules which impose restrictions to the existence of potential renormalization group flows between conformal field theories . while initially analyzed for su(2 ) , this statement was recently extended to su(n ) by lecheminant.@xcite we will add a further layer of insight to this analysis by showing that topological phase transitions between symmetry protected topological phases may generally be forced to be described by multicritical points , just by symmetry considerations .    deeply intertwined with the study of haldane phases is the investigation of a potential generalization of haldane s conjecture to su(n ) spin systems , see ref .   for the original conjecture , ref .   for a review and refs .   for more recent studies and proposals .",
    "as suggested in ref .  , the su(n ) heisenberg model should generally lead to a gapped phase if and only if the physical spin permits the construction of a symmetry protected topological phase .",
    "otherwise it should be gapless .",
    "our current analysis leads us to our own version of haldane s conjecture and to an educated guess about the nature of the phase realized by the su(4 ) heisenberg hamiltonian for adjoint representation .",
    "last but not least , our analysis should also be seen in connection with recent experimental progress on the realization of su(n ) magnetism in ultra - cold gases of fermionic alkaline - earth atoms.@xcite the adjoint representation we are using to realize our haldane phases is considerably smaller than the self - conjugate representation suggested in ref .  .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that it enjoys a better stability when realized in terms of elementary fermionic degrees of freedom and better experimental addressability .",
    "for a general discussion of one - dimensional su(n ) spin systems and their realization in the strong coupling limit of fermi - hubbard models we refer to a recent review.@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sc : setup ]",
    "we introduce the physical setup , i.e.  we specify the physical su(n ) spin we would like to study and we classify the terms which may enter a general su(n)-invariant hamiltonian with nearest neighbor interactions . the technical foundations of the paper",
    "are presented in section  [ sc : haldane ] . after outlining the general philosophy of the aklt construction we discuss in detail which auxiliary spins are permitted if the physical spin is to transform in the adjoint representation .",
    "we then provide an exhaustive discussion of su(n)-invariant two - site operators , with a particular focus on higher order spin - spin couplings . in order to discuss the properties of these operators we then introduce birdtracks , a convenient graphical calculus , which provides a simple way to determine their eigenvalues .",
    "our main results are contained in section  [ sc : hamiltonians ] . here",
    "we explicitly state the aklt hamiltonians which give rise to chiral haldane phases with topological quantum number @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "this is followed by a brief discussion of the special cases su(3 ) and su(4 ) .    in section  [ sc : correlations ] we show how the graphical calculus may be used to determine the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix , resulting in a proof of the gapfulness of our aklt states .",
    "a more detailed exploration of the phase diagram is provided in section  [ sc : phasediagram ] , with a particular focus on critical phases . in this context",
    "we also discuss the nature of potential topological phase transitions and the implications of symmetries for the occurrence of multicritical points .",
    "in section  [ sc : parenthamiltonian ] we present our idea of a universal parent hamiltonian .",
    "this is then adapted to compute the precise form of the aklt hamiltonians under consideration .",
    "our approach leads to some thoughts on haldane s conjecture for su(n ) quantum spin models which are presented in section [ sc : conjecture ] .",

    "the occurrence of this non - trivial multiplicity will play a crucial role later on , both technically and physically .",
    "as will become clear below , these two adjoint representations are associated with the completely symmetric tensor @xmath23 and the structure constants @xmath24 , respectively .    from the decomposition",
    "we infer that there are nine linearly independent su(n ) invariant operators which act on the two - site hilbert space . out of these ,",
    "seven are associated with projectors @xmath25 onto the individual irreducible components appearing in the decomposition .",

    "we shall now investigate whether the phase diagram under consideration permits the construction of non - trivial haldane phases . with a haldane phase we mean a gapped spin liquid phase of a 1d quantum spin system which exhibits non - trivial symmetry protected topological order . as was shown in ref .",
    ", su(n ) spin systems can exhibit up to @xmath2 distinct haldane phases . in principle , all of them can be realized by using the ideas of the original aklt construction.@xcite based on this philosophy , examples of generalized aklt hamiltonians for su(n ) have been worked out in refs .  .",
    "the essential difference and technical complication of the present case as compared to previous investigations in the literature is the non - trivial multiplicity of the adjoint representation in the decomposition  .",
    "as we will shortly review , the aklt recipe for the construction of a parent hamiltonian requires one to embed the tensor product of two auxiliary spins into the tensor product of two physical spins . since the former includes the adjoint representation",
    "_ once _ , we encounter the mathematical problem of identifying the proper one - dimensional subspace of this two - dimensional space and of constructing the corresponding projection operator ( or rather its orthogonal complement ) . if we choose the wrong embedding , the corresponding aklt state fails to have the desired properties , e.g.  it might be degenerate .",

    ".   for the particular case of an su(3 ) spin chain . in",
    "what follows , we will generalize the construction of ref .   from su(3 ) to su(n ) , and we will also construct aklt states based on the auxiliary spin @xmath37 and its dual .    before entering the technical details let us briefly outline the main ingredients of a general aklt construction for a symmetry group  @xmath38 .    1 .",
    "the physical spins transform in a representation @xmath12 which is assumed to be self - dual , @xmath39 .",
    "self - duality of the physical spin @xmath12 is required for the construction of a translation invariant aklt state .",
    "each physical spin @xmath12 is thought to be made up from two auxiliary spins @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in other words , @xmath40 arises from a suitable projection on the tensor product of the two auxiliary spins .",
    "3 .   for technical reasons",
    "we also demand that @xmath41 .",
    "this should be thought of as a kind of non - degeneracy condition .",
    "these structures allow to write down an aklt state @xmath42 in matrix product form which is constructed from the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the embedding @xmath40 , see figure  [ fig : vbs ] for an illustration .",
    "the state will be unique for an infinite system or if periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "in contrast , with open boundary conditions on both sides it will be parametrized in terms of two boundary spins @xmath13 and @xmath14 whose states are elements of @xmath43 .",
    "the representation type of the boundary spins will , moreover , determine the topological quantum number characterizing the aklt state ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "in addition to the state , the aklt recipe also introduces a natural @xmath38-symmetric and translation invariant hamiltonian .",
    "for two physical sites this hamiltonian is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the projection onto the subspace @xmath43 inside of @xmath46 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath47 is then simply a projection onto its orthogonal complement .",

    "since this turns @xmath42 into a ground state of @xmath48 the latter is usually called a parent hamiltonian .",
    "frequently , @xmath42 is actually the unique ground state , at least modulo the freedom of specifying the internal state of potentially existing boundary spins .",
    "since it will be of great importance for our study , we would like to emphasize a subtle point that arises if the representation @xmath13 is not self - dual , i.e.  if @xmath51 . in this case",
    ", the aklt construction will generally lead to two different aklt states @xmath52 and @xmath53 which are distinguished by the order of the factors in the tensor product @xmath43 . while this tensor product is obviously invariant under the exchange of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the 1d arrangement with the presence of singlet bonds between neighboring physical sites implies the presence of a natural orientation and a distinction in the associated aklt states .",
    "mathematically speaking , the swap modifies the embedding of @xmath43 into @xmath46 .",
    "all our statements can easily be illustrated with figure  [ fig : vbs ] , where the exchange of @xmath13 and @xmath14 leads to the inversion of the whole picture .",
    "this also means that the state @xmath42 and the associated hamiltonian @xmath48 as defined from eq .   will necessarily be _ chiral",
    "_ whenever @xmath51 .",
    "turning this argument around , this also implies the following statement : if one has an inversion symmetric hamiltonian which has one of the aklt states @xmath52 or @xmath53 as its ground state , then its image under inversion will also automatically be a ground state . in other words : there is a non - trivial ground state degeneracy and spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking .",
    "this mechanism provides a general explanation for the observations in the papers .      from now on we will assume the physical spin @xmath54 to transform in the adjoint representation of su(n ) . on the other hand",
    ", we will explore the possibility to employ different types of auxiliary spins @xmath13 for the aklt construction , notably those of the form @xmath55 the representation @xmath56 corresponds to the anti - symmetric part of the @xmath57-fold tensor product of the fundamental representation with itself .",
    "for this type of auxiliary spin , the dual representation is given by @xmath58 , i.e.  it belongs to the same family of representations . for symmetry reasons we can thus restrict our attention to cases with @xmath59 .",

    "we need to know the tensor product decomposition of auxiliary spins which , in this case , reads ( for @xmath60 ) @xmath61 where the symbols @xmath62 and @xmath63 both refer to the trivial one - dimensional representation and the representations @xmath64 are described by the young tableaux @xmath65\\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] formally , we can identify @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "we note that the tensor product decomposition   has @xmath69 contributions . in general it",
    "will thus not be possible to satisfy requirement  3 , i.e.@xmath41 , since the right hand side only features up to seven representations .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that condition  3 is satisfied if and only if @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",

    "the arguments of ref .   can easily be generalized to other symmetry groups using the general classification of orbifold wzw theories.@xcite for the group of interest for us , namely su(n ) , the corresponding analysis has been carried out in ref .  . in that case , the discrete symmetry which needs to be gauged is the group @xmath6 , the center of su(n ) .",
    "this effectively turns the group su(n ) into the group @xmath0 .",
    "let us now try a change of perspective .",
    "so far , the discussion in the literature was solely concerned with the stability of gapless phases and with selection rules on renormalization group flows between conformal field theories . here",
    ", we would like to point out that the same arguments also have strong implications for the nature of topological phase transitions .",
    "more precisely , we will argue that the phase transitions between symmetry protected topological phases of su(n ) lattice models may correspond to multicritical points , i.e.  to higher level su(n ) wzw models , under specific circumstances .    to explain the basic philosophy underlying our claim we first look at the familiar example of the spin-1 haldane phase for su(2 ) .",
    "since the spins transform in the spin-1 representation , the subgroup @xmath227 is acting trivially , turning the actual symmetry into @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , the model has an additional @xmath224 symmetry ( or rather redundancy ) which needs to be present everywhere in the phase diagram as long as no extra degrees of freedom with half - integer spin are added .",
    "this @xmath224-invariance then of course should also exist in the cft describing the topological phase transition from the haldane phase to the dimerized phase . and",
    "indeed , this transition is coinciding with the integrable babujian - takhtajan model which is well - known to be described by an @xmath226 wzw model ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "in the previous argument we silently skipped over a subtle point .",
    "in fact , as explained in ref .  , the @xmath224 symmetry is only present in the lattice model if the hamiltonian is translation invariant .",
    "if it is broken , the transition from the haldane phase to the dimerized phase is actually described by means of a @xmath228 wzw model .    in our present paper",
    "we deal with a translation invariant su(n ) spin chain with physical spins in the adjoint representation .",
    "since the associated young tableau has @xmath1 boxes , the central subgroup @xmath229 is actually acting trivially and the actual symmetry group is @xmath0 ( see ) .",
    "this means that the group @xmath6 should be anomaly free in the su(n ) wzw model describing potential phase transitions .",
    "a careful inspection of these models shows that this is the case for all @xmath222 if @xmath1 is odd while @xmath222 is required to be even if @xmath1 is even.@xcite we are immediately led to the conjecture that the 2nd order phase transitions in the phase diagram of our model are generically described by @xmath230 ( for odd @xmath1 ) and @xmath231 ( for even @xmath1 ) , respectively .",
    "larger values of @xmath222 can be imagined if the microscopic system by chance does not feature certain relevant operators .",
    "the latter can not be excluded solely based on symmetry considerations .",
    "the same kind of argument also predicts a value of @xmath225 for topological phase transitions in translation invariant su(n ) spin systems which are based on the self - conjugate representation of ref .   since the definition of the latter requires @xmath1 to be even .",
    "of course , the idea just presented may be generalized to other continuous symmetry groups  @xmath38 beyond su(n ) . in order to fully appreciate the generality of our claims",
    "it is important to note that the existence of symmetry protected topological phases crucially relies on ( part of ) the central subgroup of  @xmath38 acting trivially on the physical representation.@xcite it is remarkable that the mathematical structures governing potential anomalies in critical theories with continuous symmetry group and the classification of symmetry protected topological phases are related in such a deep fashion .",
    "let us finally reiterate that considerations very similar to the ones above have already appeared before in the literature.@xcite the focus of these works , however , was the stability of gapless phases",
    ". to our knowledge the connection to gapped symmetry protected topological phases and ( topological ) phase transitions has not been stressed so far .      in order to obtain unique ground states we deliberately chose to add inversion symmetry breaking terms to our aklt hamiltonians . of course one could also simply follow the alternative recipe of refs .   where inversion symmetry in the hamiltonian is restored at the cost of having a two - fold degenerate ground state .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonians should be of the form @xmath232     & = { \\mathbbm{1}}-3\\gamma n(5n^2 - 4)\\bigl[4\\,\\vec{s}_1\\cdot\\vec{s}_2-(\\vec{s}_1\\cdot\\vec{s}_2)^3\\bigr]\\\\[2 mm ]     & \\qquad-\\gamma(7n^2 - 4)\\bigl[4\\,(\\vec{s}_1\\cdot\\vec{s}_2)^2-(\\vec{s}_1\\cdot\\vec{s}_2)^4\\bigr ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] for an auxiliary spin in the ( anti-)fundamental representation and , similarly , @xmath233     & = { \\mathbbm{1}}+4n\\delta(n^3 + 6 n^2 + 18 n+12)\\,\\vec{s}_1\\cdot\\vec{s}_2\\\\[2 mm ]     & \\qquad-2\\delta(n^4 + 3 n^3 - 12 n-8)\\,(\\vec{s}_1\\cdot\\vec{s}_2)^2\\\\[2 mm ]     & \\qquad-\\delta n(3n^2 + 16n+12)\\,(\\vec{s}_1\\cdot\\vec{s}_2)^3\\\\[2 mm ]     & \\qquad-\\delta(n^2 + 6 n+4)\\,(\\vec{s}_1\\cdot\\vec{s}_2)^4 \\end{split}\\ ] ] for an auxiliary spin in the anti - symmetric representation .",

    "we specialize to the case of interest for us .",

    "note that only requires knowledge of the ` gluon vertex ' @xmath244{figs / appeq0h.pdf } \\end{array } } $ ] , which encodes how the physical spin can be written in terms of the boundary spins .",
    "let us discuss the properties of the operator .",
    "first , we note that @xmath245 as defined in is not necessarily a projector .",
    "this property , usually deemed necessary , of aklt hamiltonians may indeed be lost during the embedding of the physical space @xmath12 into @xmath43 . to be precise",
    ", @xmath245 is a sum of projectors into the constituent representations of @xmath46 , with non - negative but ( generally ) distinct coefficients .",
    "nevertheless , taken on a finite chain we find the same ground state which along with a gap , indicates that we are in the same topological phase .",
    "a way of ` renormalizing ' the projectors coefficients back to their standard value  @xmath143 will be outlined after the next paragraph .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian is generally _ not self - conjugate_. conjugation amounts to reversing each arrow and physically leads to a parent hamiltonian for another aklt state which can be thought of as the image under inversion or time - reversal .",
    "only if the auxiliary representation @xmath246 is self - dual , will the associated aklt state be invariant under these transformations .",
    "this is the case for example , in the original aklt state for su(2 ) and for the aklt states suggested in ref .  .",
    "in contrast , the hamiltonians considered in the present paper are all chiral , with the sole exception of su(4 ) , as discussed below .    as the bulk of the paper deals with the hamiltonians written in terms of projectors we do the same for . as before , the hilbert space for two physical sites as @xmath247 where we distinguish the irreducible representation that are also in @xmath43 from the ` rest ' .",
    "if the @xmath248 were distinct then we could write @xmath249 and normalizing each of the @xmath202 to @xmath143 gives a true projector if needed .",
    "indeed , this is nothing but the usual prescription of projecting out the boundary spins from the space of two physical spins .",
    "however , for the cases that are of chief interest in our paper , i.e.when @xmath12 is the adjoint representation , we have a non - trivial multiplicity and the right hand side of is a block matrix where the diagonal contains projectors and the off - diagonal entries permute different copies of the degenerate representation .",

    "assuming isotropy and in the limit of infinite length , we have a gapped phase with a unique ground state while the latter is gapless .",
    "this conjecture is well - supported by numerical evidence and may be arguable considered proven , in the large @xmath278 limit.@xcite    for su(n ) , there are two obvious directions in which to generalize .",
    "first , we may ask which representations realize a gapless phase .",
    "one result by affleck and lieb @xcite states that rectangular young tableaux where the total number of boxes has no common factors with @xmath1 , are gapless .",
    "greiter and rachel suggested to extend this to non - rectangular tableau with the same divisibility condition.@xcite here we would like to point out that this non - divisibility condition exactly _ rules out _ a non - trivial topological phase which is protected by any of the groups @xmath279 where @xmath217 divides @xmath1.@xcite in other words , from symmetry considerations alone , the phase must either be gapless or topologically trivial .    the second direction concerns the gapped phases  for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath1 divides the number of boxes in the tableau . assuming the heisenberg model is indeed gapped , what is the topological class ( the protected boundary spins if any ) ? for su(2 ) it is well known that the spin @xmath143 chain has protected spin @xmath280 modes at the boundary .",
    "since the heisenberg hamiltonian is inversion symmetric , a unique ground state implies the boundary spin to be self - conjugate too .",
    "this is indeed possible for su(4 ) if the boundary states are in a six - dimensional @xmath197 multiplet .    * conjecture * : the heisenberg chain for su(4 ) in the adjoint representation is in the same phase as the aklt hamiltonian of eq .  .",
    "when the physical spin is in the representation @xmath281 , the analogous statement has been convincingly shown in refs .  .",
    "finally we turn to the chiral phases which break inversion symmetry , and occupy most of this paper .",
    "a natural question is whether the heisenberg model flows to such a chiral gapped phase when perturbed by a small inversion breaking term e.g.  @xmath109 .",
    "both this question and the above conjecture are within the scope of present dmrg numerical methods .",
    "in this paper we have provided a systematic analysis of haldane phases in su(n ) spin chains with physical spins transforming in the adjoint representation . with the help of birdtracks we succeeded in constructing aklt hamiltonians for auxiliary spins transforming in the fundamental @xmath131 or the rank-2 anti - symmetric representation @xmath37 . it should be emphasized that our hamiltonians have _ unique _ ground states which , by construction , reside in topological sectors characterized by the @xmath6 quantum numbers @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath10$].@xcite this is in stark contrast to earlier investigations@xcite where only hamiltonians leading to a two - fold ground state degeneracy and an associated spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking have been considered . for su(4 ) our analysis gives the first complete account of all existing haldane phases.@xcite    on the way we had to overcome a number of technical complications .",
    "the main problem arose from the fact that the decomposition of the physical two - site hilbert space into irreducible representations of su(n ) features a non - trivial multiplicity . in this space we had to identify a specific one - dimensional subspace and we showed how this can be achieved transparently using birdtracks . besides helping us with the construction of the aklt states and their associated hamiltonians this method also gave access to the eigenvalues of the ground states transfer matrix .",
    "as a consequence , we have been able to confirm the existence of a spectral gap , partially reproducing earlier results in the literature .",
    "it should be clear that our method can easily be extended to the determination of spin - spin correlation functions ( see ref .",
    "for an algebraic derivation for the first of our two cases ) .    in a first and rather sketchy attempt to characterize the phase diagram of our spin chains we focused on the potential presence of special integrable and/or critical points . as one of the remarkable features the phase diagram shows the existence of an integrable point with enhanced @xmath282 symmetry and an effective description in terms of a @xmath282 wzw model at level @xmath212 .",
    "at least one other integrable point is likely to exist but the explicit construction of its hamiltonian requires the fusion procedure for integrable models@xcite and has not been attempted here .",
    "let us stress that our paper also contains two results which are of rather general importance beyond the specific setup we have been investigating .",
    "the first one concerns a proposal for a universal parent hamiltonian in section  [ sc : parenthamiltonian ] which may function as a convenient replacement for the standard aklt construction , also in the case of other symmetry groups and/or representations .",
    "secondly , we found an intimate relation between the classification of symmetry protected topological phases with continuous symmetry groups@xcite and a potential multicriticality of topological phase transitions .",
    "specifically , we have been led to conjecture that the critical points in the phase diagram of our model for even values of @xmath1 should all be described by su(n ) wzw models with level @xmath225 ( except at fine - tuned points where @xmath222 may be even larger ) .",
    "this , as well as our conjecture about the nature of the phase realized in the su(4 ) heisenberg chain , certainly deserve future study .",
    "of course there are also a few important issues that we did not touch upon in the present article .",
    "one concerns the nature of the excitations above the ground state which may lead to a similar interpretation as in ref .  .",
    "it is expected that our precise knowledge of the hamiltonians for general values of @xmath1 will facilitate future large-@xmath1 analyses .",
    "another direction of research would be to enlarge the phase diagram by admitting terms in the hamiltonian which break the su(n ) symmetry but still preserve the subgroup @xmath283 . as was discussed in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  )",
    "this symmetry protects the same type of haldane phases which are hence stable against such deformations .",
    "some studies in this direction have been performed in refs .  , albeit mostly for @xmath22 or a different physical representation .",
    "finally , in view of the experimental progress in the realization of systems exhibiting su(n ) magnetism it is a pressing question to which extent the phases we have been discussing can actually be realized in a variant of the fermi - hubbard model or even in experiment.@xcite    we would like to thank kasper duivenvoorden , philippe lecheminant , frederic mila , pierre nataf , michael stone and martin zirnbauer for useful discussions .",
