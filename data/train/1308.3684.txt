    "<S> despite water is the most studied substance in the earth , it is not completely understood why its structural and dynamical properties give rise to some anomalous behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> interesting properties emerge when experiments at low temperatures and/or high pressures , are performed . here </S>",
    "<S> we report dielectric measurements of cold water under constrained conditions , i.e. water that below the melting point can not freeze . </S>",
    "<S> the inner pressure shifts the @xmath0 relaxation peak to similar frequencies as seen in ice ih . also , when we reach the triple point at 251 k , ice iii seems to form . </S>",
    "<S> as far as we know , this via to obtain such crystalline phase has not been observed .    since the seminal works of canton _ et al _ in the eighteen century @xcite , water has been extensively studied to understand its structure and dynamical behavior . due to its small molecular size , its polarity , and most importantly </S>",
    "<S> , the interaction through hydrogen bonds , water exhibits many special properties . </S>",
    "<S> most authors agree to call such properties as anomalous @xcite , and a sophisticated phase diagram is an evidence of it @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> water has eleven stable triple points and a remarkable versatility in crystalline structure forming , like no other known substance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature decreases at atmospheric or hyperbaric pressures , water molecules rearrange themselves to occupy either less volume or more , changing their length and angle of the hydrogen bonds . </S>",
    "<S> different paths exists to form the crystalline structures .    below @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> k , water can exist in a liquid state in precarious equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> when it is cooled around @xmath2 k / s , freezing can be avoided and water remains in a supercooled state , until it turns into glass @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> crystalline phases are usually obtained by pressurization produced by a piston and gasses at low temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , ice iii is generally obtained by three different ways : cooling the liquid at about 300 mpa , warming ice ii at about 300 mpa , or decompressing ice v at about 247 k @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> dielectric spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful technique to investigate the molecular behavior of water . particularly because the relaxation times provide information about the cooperative processes , proton mobility , viscosity of the medium and , in general , structural properties of the molecular network @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the technique we use in work reported in the present letter , where dielectric measurements of water at low temperatures and constant volume are performed . at these conditions , as we decrease the temperature the pressure diverges . </S>",
    "<S> this internal pressure shifts the debye relaxation to lower frequencies , the very same than ice ih . at temperatures below 251 k , </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation times deviate and slightly increase , possibly due to the formation of a thin shell of ice iii and ih .    </S>",
    "<S> our experimental measurements were carried out in a tight and long cylindrical capacitor able to endure inner pressures as high as 200 mpa . </S>",
    "<S> the results here reported were obtained using pure water ( mili - q , @xmath3 m@xmath4 cm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the setup is similar to the one employed in a previous paper @xcite , with the following modifications : the cylindrical stainless steel capacitor is 15 cm long , surrounded by an aluminium block with channels where dynalene flows through in order to regulate the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> two different samples were studied . </S>",
    "<S> first , the capacitor was totally filled with 6.87 ml of water and sealed with two rigid nylon caps that are screwed to the outer electrode . </S>",
    "<S> second , @xmath5 of the above volume was poured inside the capacitor , cool it down to freeze and then closed . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric properties , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , were measured using a lcr meter ( hp 4284a ) in the interval of frequency @xmath9 - 3x@xmath10 hz . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the device was controlled by a polysciences circulating bath from 277 to 239 k in steps of 2 k , with a thermal stability of @xmath11 k. after each temperature is reached , we waited approximately 60 min to get thermal equilibrium in the whole capacitor .            </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] shows the relative permittivity as a function of frequency for water ( a ) and ice ih ( b ) at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the main aim of this work was to study the behavior of the first , but we show the results of ice ih ( a phase well studied before @xcite ) only for comparative purposes </S>",
    "<S> . it can be observed in ( a ) the usual dielectric response of water from 277 to 269 k , composed by a region of a very high relative permittivity at the lowest frequencies , caused by a maxwell - wagner - sillars ( mws ) polarization , and a second region where the dipole response gives a flat contribution . from 267 to 239 </S>",
    "<S> k the debye relaxation moves to lower frequencies as the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> note that an intriguing response occurs at 267 k : the whole spectrum separates notoriously from the rest of the curves ( this result will be later discussed ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although the dielectric loss signal is normally given by the imaginary part of complex dielectric function , we prefer to plot the @xmath7 in order to highlight the details of the main relaxation peak , see fig . [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> again , there is a clear distinction between the response obtained at 267 k from those found at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while the maximum amplitudes of ice ih are quite the same regardless the temperature , for water they increase as the temperature decreases .            </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric spectra of figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] were fitted to an expression that takes into account the @xmath0 relaxation , the mws electrode polarization and the dc - conductivity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] shows the dielectric relaxation times obtained from such fits versus the reciprocal temperature for water and ice ih . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation times for water are similar to the ones reported for ice ih @xcite but they start to separate at 251 k. in order to understand this behavior , let us see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , which depicts the water phase diagram for pressures below @xmath12 mpa @xcite in the temperature range of this work . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that , as the liquid is cooled below 273 k , the thermodynamic path follows the coexistence line where the pressure climbs to very high values . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , according to the clausius - clapeyron equation @xmath13 ( where p , t , h and v are the pressure , temperature , enthalpy and volume , respectively ) , the pressure augments considerably due to the fact the volume is not allowed to increase . </S>",
    "<S> this inner pressure acts against the electrodes and when it reaches approximately @xmath14 mpa ( at 251 k ) , a shell of ice iii starts to nucleate on the electrode surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , due to the fact ice iii is denser than water , as soon as it appears , it leaves space for a thin layer of ice ih to form . in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we show a schematic of this situation . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , liquid water must necessarily remain in the interior because neither ice ih nor ice iii can completely fill its volume . </S>",
    "<S> it is enthralling to think that ice iii can not fill the volume because , in the absence of external pressure , who else would exert the pressure it needs to exist ?    the relaxation times shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] have an arrhenius behavior , but it is unexpected that they are of the same order . </S>",
    "<S> one could think that this is natural due to the fact both phases coexist . however , it is not at all easy to see how the relaxation times of water are around 8 orders of magnitude greater than normal water @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible to explain such outcome if we draw up on previous works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , it is stated that when water is compressed at very high pressures the molecules increase the number of near neighbours and the tetrahedrality force field of the network is broken . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the energy landscape is less partitioned and molecules rotate easily . under these conditions </S>",
    "<S> the applied electric field can not align the water dipoles as easily unless the frequency of the field is low . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the relaxation times are large . in other words , in ice ih the dipoles are fixed , in water under pressure are free . </S>",
    "<S> it is fascinating to find that the relaxation times are similar .    </S>",
    "<S> last but not least , we now go back to fig . [ fig1 ] </S>",
    "<S> where the curve corresponding to 267 k is puzzling . as we previously mentioned , the high pressure increases molecular rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this event requires that at least two hydrogen bonds break @xcite . coincidentally , such reorganization of the hydrogen bonds propel grotthus mechanism , which is related to a fast transport of protons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we believe this is the only way to explain a very high value of @xmath6 ( note that at frequencies where the electric polarization is normally not existing , @xmath15 hz , @xmath6 is much greater than 100 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as far as we know , this is the first time a dielectric signature of grotthus mechanism has been observed .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , we have found a subtle but clear signal of ice iii formed when water is cooled below its melting point in a constrained volume . with it , we believe ice ih is also formed . </S>",
    "<S> we must emphasize that this water - ice iii - ice ih coexistence occurs at complete equilibrium , in contrast to the metastable state of supercooled water . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inner pressure shifts the @xmath0 peak of normal water to low frequencies ( khz ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we found an intriguing dielectric signal at 267 k probably caused by a fast ionic transport . </S>",
    "<S> our results may have important implications in the understanding of water dynamics under pressure . </S>"
