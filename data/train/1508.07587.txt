    "hamiltonian systems describing 1-dimensional ( 1d ) particle chains characterized by interactions of various ranges constitute an active area of research with increasing interest due to their applicability in many scientific fields . in particular , the relevance of long ( vs. short ) range interactions has been extensively studied and intensely debated in a wide variety of problems of statistical mechanics , mean field theories , active matter , dynamical networks , etc . regarding the various degrees of chaos involved in their time evolution .",
    "in statistical physics for example , the classical boltzmann framework for the appropriate entropy functional at thermal equilibrium is not adequate for describing systems with long range interactions , as remarked already by j. w. gibbs @xcite .    in the past 25 years",
    ", a great number of researchers @xcite have shown that there exist long lasting quasi  stationary states ( qss ) in a variety of physical and biological systems characterized as _",
    "non  additive _ , i.e. that can not be decomposed in entirely independent parts . in such cases , a different entropy functional ( the so  called tsallis entropy ) appears to be more suitable for their thermodynamic description , while the associated probability distribution functions are of the @xmath6gaussian type with @xmath7 .",
    "this divergence from the classical boltzmann ",
    "gibbs maxwellian distributions of @xmath8 , raises new questions regarding the statistical and dynamical behavior of such systems in the thermodynamic limit of very large @xmath9 and total energy @xmath10 , with @xmath11 constant .",
    "as we have demonstrated in recent publications @xcite , systems with long range interactions ( lri ) have significant advantages , since they often exhibit _ a weaker chaos _ than those with interactions only between nearest neighbors .",
    "for example , in active matter systems consisting of self - propelled particles ( like birds ) it has been observed that nonlocal communication acts as a counterbalance against external threats or attacks .",
    "this is the case , for instance with flocks of starlings described by the so  called topological model introduced by the starflag group @xcite .",
    "their observations on groups of starlings in rome revealed that synchronized movements are based on a fixed number of interacting neighbors , independent of the distance between them .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that the number @xmath12 of interacting particles in the topological model is crucial for the coherence of the group : @xmath12 needs to be large enough to overcome random perturbations as well as maintain cohesion .",
    "on the other hand , the study of lri in the classical framework of dynamical systems is of great interest .",
    "spatially localized oscillations called breathers , well  known as simple periodic solutions of lattices with nearest neighbor interactions , make their appearance also in hamiltonian systems with lri ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "another interesting type of collective behavior occurs in the form of long - living qss of the type mentioned above , while in a system of @xmath9 coupled planar rotators that interact via long - range forces critical regions were found where these states appear @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite a systematic study of the largest lyapunov exponent showed that it decays as a power - law with @xmath9 , making the system quasi ",
    "integrable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "such qss were also studied in a generalized mean field system , where interactions decay with distance according to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the fermi - pasta - ulam-@xmath13 model ( fpu-@xmath13 ) with lri was studied in @xcite and opened a new branch of research in this field . in @xcite for example , the authors explore instability regimes for the low frequency modes of an fpu-@xmath13 chain in relation to the long  standing question of the relaxation times required to reach energy equipartition among all modes .    in the present paper we focus on two topics : ( i )",
    "first we extend recent studies of nearest - neighbor hamiltonian lattices to analogous models involving lri , and ( ii ) we employ numerical integration schemes to compute the tangent dynamics needed for the calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows : in section [ lri ] we discuss in detail the transition to lri for different boundary conditions , while in section [ ve ] we solve the associated variational equations for specific chaotic states .",
    "subsection [ 2si ] gives the basic properties and definitions of symplectic integrators and discusses in subsection [ tmm ] the so ",
    "called tangent map method .",
    "finally , in section [ nr ] we apply these techniques to two different hamiltonian systems : the mean field model of planar rotors and the fpu-@xmath13 chain , both with interactions modulated by the factor @xmath0 .",
    "we end with our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "let us consider a 1d hamiltonian chain with quadratic kinetic energy in the generalized momenta and a potential that depends purely on the generalized positions and contains nearest neighbor interactions together with an on - site potential .",
    "this system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are canonical conjugate pairs of positions and momenta and boundary conditions are chosen arbitrarily .    ) on the left are converted into long range systems on the right . in our paper the strength of this interaction decays with distance as @xmath0 , for finite @xmath1 .",

    "[ transition ] ) .",
    "then , of course , one can apply interactions which depend on the topological distance and decay with distance as @xmath0 , with @xmath20 , as in @xcite .",
    "next , ( [ hamgen ] ) is converted to a hamiltonian with lri :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 defines the topological distance , i.e. the minimum connection between the particles @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the rescaling factor necessary for making the hamiltonian ( [ hamlri ] ) extensive , which means that the potential function @xmath26 is proportional to the system size and would converge faster to infinity than the other two sums of ( [ hamlri ] ) in the thermodynamic limit . ] . in particular , when the chain has fixed or open boundary conditions , we set @xmath27 and when it has periodic boundary conditions we write : @xmath28    the role of the parameter @xmath29 which controls the range of interaction is essential .",
    "the two extreme cases are : ( i ) @xmath30 , where only interactions between first neighbors apply and ( ii ) @xmath31 , which corresponds to the mean field model ( hmf ) , where all particles interact equally and independently of their distance , as in a fully connected graph .",
    "it appears that the implementation of lri in a hamiltonian particle chain strongly affects the system s dynamics and statistics .",
    "the excitation of a single site results in an almost immediate reaction of all the particles .",
    "the reaction time is significantly longer in simple chains .",
    "there is a number of physically interesting models whose dynamics can be extended to long range and thoroughly studied to provide representative examples for the lri effect : ( i ) the klein - gordon chain for @xmath32 and @xmath33 in ( [ hamlri ] ) , ( ii ) a system consisting of coupled planar rotators with @xmath34 ( and @xmath35 ) and ( iii ) the fermi - pasta - ulam-@xmath13 ( fpu-@xmath13 ) model with @xmath36 in ( [ hamlri ] ) .",
    "systems ( ii ) and ( iii ) are the ones treated in the present paper , while extensions of the kg model ( i ) will be dealt with in a future publication .",
    "the equations of motion for the hamiltonian system ( [ hamlri ] ) with lri read : @xmath37    the tangent dynamics ( or variational equations ) of a dynamical system is of great importance in uncovering the local properties of its solutions that lead to the estimation of chaotic indicators such as lyapunov and gali exponents @xcite . in the case of a mechanical system",
    "the variational equations are defined on the tangent space of the configuration space , constituting a 4@xmath9 dimensional phase space . in particular , the variational equations of the system ( [ hamlri ] ) can be written in the following form : @xmath38 where each element of the matrix @xmath39 is given by the second partial derivatives @xmath40 calculated along the orbit @xmath41 , while @xmath42 are the zero and identity @xmath43 matrices respectively .",
    "now the equations of motion ( [ hameq ] ) together with their variations ( [ vandw ] ) constitute a time - dependent hamiltonian system defined on the tangent space of the system ( [ hamlri ] ) and expressed by : @xmath44      symplectic integration schemes are designed to conserve the symplectic structure of a hamiltonian system exactly , but not its total energy . during the computations , neither the orbit nor the hamiltonian @xmath45 itself",
    "are precisely followed .",
    "even though these are not desirable properties for an integration method , symplectic integration still has great advantages compared with other methods @xcite : ( i ) there exists an analytic autonomous hamiltonian system @xmath46 which is followed exactly @xcite and provides the so  called backward error analysis .",
    "( ii ) energy errors are bounded and hence do not increase for exponentially long times .    for reasons of self  consistency and in order to help the reader who is not familiar with symplectic integration theory , we give here some notations in the spirit of lie algebras @xcite .",
    "a symplectic integrator approximates the solution @xmath47 of the system by splitting the kinetic and potential terms of the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the kinetic and @xmath50 the potential operator , which do not commute in general .",
    "if we denote by @xmath51 the time step of the algorithm , the truncation in the taylor expansion of @xmath52 determines the order of precision in terms of @xmath51 .",
    "the standard 2nd order symmetric exponential splitting @xcite , is : @xmath53[split ] with truncation errors of order @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , yoshida has shown @xcite that the symplectic integrators for @xmath55 and @xmath12 even are constructed by the composition of 2nd order ones .",
    "more specifically , he proved that the constants satisfying a 4th order symplectic scheme : @xmath56 are the solutions of the algebraic equations : @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ ve ] , the variational equations of ( [ hamlri ] ) constitute a time - dependent hamiltonian system and therefore admit a symplectic integration scheme ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the extended hamiltonian ( [ hamvar2 ] ) is defined on the tangent space of the phase space solutions and consequently the operator @xmath59 acts on the extended position momentum vector @xmath60 . in particular",
    ", @xmath59 decomposes again into the kinetic - potential operators : @xmath61 and @xmath62 through which we can now proceed to solve the variational equations of the problem .",
    "the 1d xy model is a chain of @xmath9 planar rotators , describing a system of spins coupled by nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the implementation of lri to this model has already been studied in various interesting papers @xcite in connection with its statistical and dynamical properties .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system reads : @xmath63 where for @xmath30 the classical nearest - neighbor rotators are recovered , while for @xmath64 ( [ prham ] ) reduces to the so  called hmf model . regarding this model , latora et al .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath64 case , while anteneodo and tsallis @xcite explored the more general @xmath65 system .    the variational equations for this model are easily derived from ( [ prham ] ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67    the system ( [ vareq ] ) is used for the calculation of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath68 .",
    "after a careful study of the behavior of the lyapunov exponents in the hmf model , latora et al .",
    "@xcite established how they depend on the specific energy @xmath69 and the system size . more specifically , in a graph of @xmath70 versus the specific energy ,",
    "all data show a peak around @xmath71 , which weakly depends on the system size .",
    "furthermore , @xmath70 exhibits a decreasing level of chaos with increasing @xmath9 as it decays as @xmath72 . in the same spirit ,",
    "anteneodo et al . in @xcite also demonstrated a power law decay of @xmath68 vs. @xmath9 for the system ( [ prham ] ) and any @xmath2 .",
    "as we discuss below , the fpu model under lri exhibits a power - law decay of the maximal lyapunov exponent with increasing @xmath9 similar to the coupled rotators system .",
    "however , remarkably enough in the fpu case @xmath68 does not decay as the specific energy increases , but continues to grow as a power law .      in the case of the fpu-@xmath13 chain",
    ", lri can be implemented in various ways since the system has a potential with two distinct nearest neighbor parts , a quadratic and a quartic one @xcite @xmath73 clearly , the most general approach would be to add lri with different @xmath74 exponents to each part of the potential as follows : @xmath75 providing thus the system with two independent ranges , an @xmath76 controlling the quadratic part of the potential and an @xmath77 controlling the quartic part .",
    "one can then focus on the computation of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath68 , as @xmath9 increases at fixed specific energy @xmath69 . to this end",
    "we need to integrate the variational equations : @xmath78 with @xmath79 using the tangent map method of section [ tmm ] , with @xmath80 .",
    "the specific symplectic scheme we have employed is the yoshida 4th order exponential splitting ( [ 4si ] ) , while the method for calculating the lyapunov exponent is based on benettin et al .",
    "@xcite . in fig.[lemax ] we plot the results of the model with lri imposed only on the quartic potential , i.e. @xmath81 and @xmath82 , so that only the long range interactions involved in ( [ lrifpu ] ) are nonlinear .",
    "furthermore , in all computations of this section we apply fixed boundary conditions , while periodic boundaries give very similar results .",
    "the initial conditions correspond to all positions equal to zero and momenta drawn randomly from a uniform distribution .    the evolution of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath68 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ lemax](a ) versus the system size @xmath9 in double logarithmic scale for several nonlinear ranges @xmath74 and energies that vary proportionally to @xmath9 , keeping the specific energy @xmath83 fixed .",
    "as pointed out in previous studies , we also find here that for @xmath2 the lyapunov exponent decays as @xmath9 increases by a power - law of the form @xmath84 , @xmath85 implying thus that the system tends to become less chaotic as the degrees of freedom grow . instead for @xmath86 the lyapunov exponents tend to stabilize at a constant value .",
    "the higher is the @xmath29 value , the larger the @xmath68 .",
    "finally , for @xmath87 we practically recover the classical fpu-@xmath13 model and as can be seen in fig.[lemax](a ) the symbols of these two cases superpose perfectly . plotting then in fig .",
    "[ lemax](b ) @xmath68 as a function of time for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 we compute these decreasing values of @xmath68 at @xmath91 where they appear to stabilize for times greater than @xmath92 .",
    "the challenging question , therefore , is whether @xmath70 continues to decrease in the thermodynamic limit , where both @xmath9 and @xmath93 increase indefinitely .",
    "this would be quite surprising since it would imply that the system would show signs of integrability in that limit ! a more plausible alternative , of course , is that the dynamics tends to an `` edge of chaos '' state where it continues to be chaotic , albeit very weakly so , with a maximal lyapunov exponent equal to zero . since our computational capacity does not allow us to shed more light on this question , we shall have to postpone its investigation to a future analysis .",
    "we have also studied the dependence of the maximal lyapunov exponent on the specific energy of the system . recall that in subsection [ nr1 ] we mentioned that @xmath68 has been found in the planar rotators model to peak at a specific @xmath94-value .",
    "to probing further this possibility , we studied in fig.[levenergy ] the behavior of @xmath68 versus @xmath94 of the fpu@xmath95 model with @xmath96 .",
    "in contrast to the case of planar rotators , we observe that in the fpu system there is a monotonic increase of the maximal lyapunov exponent with specific energy .",
    "in particular , @xmath68 increases with the specific energy as @xmath97 .",
    "the same behavior is conjectured for all @xmath29 values , since similar results have emerged for the classical fpu@xmath95 model as well .",
    "nevertheless , the precise scaling laws depending on @xmath29 will be studied in a future publication .    ,",
    "calculated at @xmath91 for various ranges of nonlinear interaction @xmath29 ( @xmath98 , @xmath90 and fpu-@xmath95 means @xmath99 ) .",
    "( b ) evolution of the maximal lyapunov exponent for @xmath96 , @xmath98 and @xmath90 for various system sizes @xmath9.,title=\"fig : \" ] , calculated at @xmath91 for various ranges of nonlinear interaction @xmath29 ( @xmath98 , @xmath90 and fpu-@xmath95 means @xmath99 ) .",
    "( b ) evolution of the maximal lyapunov exponent for @xmath96 , @xmath98 and @xmath90 for various system sizes @xmath9.,title=\"fig : \" ]    , @xmath96 and @xmath100 .",
    "the red line corresponds to @xmath97 .",
    "[ levenergy ] ]    finally , as a test for the accuracy of our calculations , we compute the relative errors @xmath101 where @xmath102 represents the total energy of the solutions as a function of time .",
    "[ error](a ) shows the relative errors of the hamiltonian ( [ fpuham ] ) for the lri data of fig.[lemax](b ) , while fig.[error](b ) refers to relative errors in the fpu-@xmath13 model with only nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "our results verify in each case that the integrated hamiltonian @xmath46 remains within the same accuracy ( nearly 4 significant digits ) close to the desired hamiltonian @xmath45 for a time step @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the energy fluctuations become smaller and smaller in both cases when @xmath9 increases .",
    "this is interesting because it implies that @xmath103 fluctuations are independent of the behavior of the maximal lyapunov exponent , which is known to increase as a function of @xmath9 for the classical nearest - neighbor fpu system ( fig.[error](b ) ) , while it decreases for the fpu with lri ( fig.[error](a ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have no explanation why the energy fluctations are more pronounced in systems with long range interactions compared to nearest neighbor systems like fpu .     with lri and ( b ) the classical fpu-@xmath13 hamiltonian .",
    "different system sizes have been considered and same time step @xmath3.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with lri and ( b ) the classical fpu-@xmath13 hamiltonian .",
    "different system sizes have been considered and same time step @xmath3.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the study of the range of interactions in dynamical systems describing large numbers of particles is of great interest in many branches of science . in statistical physics , for instance , where the particles are modeled by nonlinear mechanical oscillators it is very important to understand the effect of mutual interactions on the dynamics and statistics of 1dimensional hamiltonian lattices in the so  called thermodynamic limit , where the number of particles @xmath9 and their total energy @xmath10 tend to infinity with @xmath104 constant . for example , in a system of @xmath9 coupled planar rotators that interact via long  range forces critical regions have been found in connection with long - living quasi  stationary states . on the other hand ,",
    "such states were also studied in a generalized mean field system , where mutual interactions decay with distance according to @xmath0 , and it was found that the largest lyapunov exponent decays as a power - law with @xmath9 .    in the present paper we have used advanced numerical techniques to extend previous studies of nearest - neighbor hamiltonian lattices to analogous models involving long range interactions . to achieve this",
    ", we have employed symplectic integrator schemes and have computed the tangent dynamics needed to calculate the largest lyapunov exponent of two different hamiltonian systems : the mean field model of planar rotors and the fpu-@xmath13 chain , both involving interactions whose range is modulated by the factor @xmath0 .",
    "we have thus been able to identify in these systems a continuous transition from strongly to weakly chaotic dynamics in the thermodynamic limit , as the parameter @xmath29 varies from infinity to zero .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath105 appears to constitute a critical crossover value where a qualitative change occurs in the dynamics and statistics of such systems . as a chaotic index",
    "we have focused on the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath70 calculated efficiently and accurately using yoshida s 4th order symplectic integrator scheme . for both models treated in this paper we found that the lyapunov exponent gives the same results : ( i ) for @xmath86 , @xmath70 tends to stabilize at a positive value as @xmath9 increases , ( ii ) for @xmath2 @xmath70 _ _ d__ecreases with system size as @xmath106 , for some positive constant @xmath107 that depends on @xmath29 . on the other hand , unlike the mean field rotator model , the @xmath70 of the fpu-@xmath13 chain increases monotonically as the specific energy @xmath104 is increased .",
    "it is certainly somewhat intriguing that when long range interactions are applied _ _",
    "o__nly to the harmonic part of the potential no crossover is observed at @xmath105 , as the dynamics remains strongly chaotic and the statistics is always of the boltzmann  gibbs type @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "all the studies carried out so far regarding long range interactions have been performed on hamiltonian systems involving only mutual interactions and no on site potential .",
    "it would , therefore , be very interesting to study these cases also in a future publication to complete our understanding of the effect of the range of interactions in 1dimensional hamiltonian lattices .",
