    "the potential of static heavy quarks illuminates the most important features of qcd dynamics : the asymptotic freedom and confinement . trying to study subtle electroweak phenomena in the heavy quark sector of standard model , we need quite an accurate quantitative understanding of effects caused by the strong interactions .",
    "in addition to the perturbative calculations for hard contributions , at present there are three general approaches to get a systematic description of how the heavy quarks are bound into the hadrons and what are the relations between the measured properties of such the hadrons and the characteristics of heavy quarks as relevant to the electroweak interactions and qcd .",
    "these approaches are the operator product expansion ( ope ) in the inverse powers of heavy quark mass , the sum rules ( sr ) of qcd and the potential models ( pm ) for the systems containing the heavy quarks by exploring various approximations of bethe - salpeter equation with the static potential treated in the framework of effective theory with a power counting in terms of powers of the inverse heavy quark mass . the first method is usually exploited in the inclusive estimates , while the second and third techniques are the frameworks of exclusive calculations .",
    "the important challenge is a consistency of evaluations obtained in such the ways , that requires the comparative analysis of calculations .",
    "a wide variety of systems and processes for the analysis provides a more complete qualitative and quantitative understanding of heavy quark dynamics .    in the leading order of perturbative qcd at short distances and with a linear confining term in the infrared region ,",
    "the potential of static heavy quarks was considered in the cornell model @xcite , incorporating the simple superposition of both asymptotic limits ( the effective coulomb and string - like interactions ) .",
    "the observed heavy quarkonia posed in the intermediate distances , where both terms are important for the determination of mass spectra .",
    "so , the phenomenological approximations of potential ( logarithmic one @xcite and power law @xcite ) , taking into account the regularities of such the spectra , were quite successful @xcite , while the quantities more sensitive to the global properties of potential are the wave functions at the origin as related to the leptonic constants and production rates .",
    "so , the potentials consistent with the asymptotic freedom to one and two loops as well as the linear confinement were proposed by richardson @xcite , buchmller and tye @xcite , respectively . technically , using a given scheme of regularization ,",
    "say , @xmath0 , one has to calculate the perturbative expansion for the potential of static quarks .",
    "this potential can be written down as the coulomb one with the running coupling constant in the so - called v scheme .",
    "thus , the perturbative calculations provide us with the matching of @xmath0 scheme with v - one .",
    "the @xmath1 loop running of @xmath2 requires the @xmath3 loop matching to @xmath4 .",
    "note , that initial two coefficients of corresponding @xmath5 functions are scheme and gauge independent , while others generally depend . with the dynamical fields integrated out",
    ", the v scheme is defined in terms of the action depending on the static sources ( the distance @xmath6 ) , so that its @xmath5 function is gauge invariant . the motivation by buchmller and tye was to write down the @xmath5 function of @xmath4 consistent with two known asymptotic regimes at short and long distances .",
    "they proposed the function , which results in the effective charge determined by two parameters , only : the perturbative parameter is the scale in the running of coupling constant at large virtualities and the nonperturbative parameter is the string tension .",
    "the necessary inputs are the coefficients of @xmath5 function .",
    "two loop results and the one loop matching condition were available to the moment . recently , the progress in calculations has provided us with the two loop matching of v and @xmath0 schemes @xcite , that can be combined with the three loop running of @xmath2 .",
    "so , the modification of buchmller  tye ( bt ) potential of static quarks as dictated by the current status of perturbative calculations is of great interest .",
    "moreover , to the moment two peculiar questions become open .",
    "first , the asymptotic perturbative expansion of bt @xmath5 function to the third order results in the three loop coefficient , which is wrong even in its sign .",
    "second , the elaborated @xmath7 parameter by bt is in a deep contradiction with the measured value @xcite .",
    "to clarify the situation , we are tending to derive the static quark potential consistent with the state of the art .",
    "thus , our motivation is to combine high order multi - loop calculations of the perturbative static potential @xcite with the string tension ansatz .",
    "so , we improve the perturbative input for the potential model in order to remove the contradiction between the modern high energy data on the qcd coupling constant and the description of heavy quark potential in the framework of one - loop buchmller  tye model , which accepts extremely high value of coupling constant evolved to the @xmath8 mass scale . in other words , if we accept the current normalization of coupling constant and introduce its value into the buchmller  tye approach to the one - loop potential , then we get the contradiction of such the potential with the heavy quarkonium mass spectra , certainly , since we find about 200 mev smaller splitting between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 levels in comparison with experimental 580 mev .",
    "this discrepancy can not be removed by the modification of nonperturbative part in the potential with no contradiction with the data on the slope of regge trajectories .",
    "therefore , the modification of perturbative input for the model of static potential in qcd is meaningful in this sense even when the nonperturbative contribution is conserved in the old string tension form .",
    "so , the significant improvement of perturbative @xmath5 function for the charge in the coulomb potential is combined with the consequent evolution from high virtualities to low ones with taking into account the influence of nonperturbative term on the evolution , that becomes essential numerically below the scale of 4 gev .",
    "we have to emphasize that to the moment of paper by buchmller and tye @xcite a theory for the heavy nonrelativistic @xmath11 pair did not exist .",
    "so , the phenomenological derivation of the static potential including perturbative short - distance and non - perturbative long - distance elements made by bt was all one could do . at present , at least for very heavy quarks , such a theory does exist in the form of pnrqcd @xcite and vnrqcd @xcite , and we address the comparison of static potential model developed in this work with these sound theoretical approaches in qcd to the physics of heavy quarkonium .",
    "another aspect of this work is devoted to the heavy quark masses .",
    "after the potential is given , the heavy quark masses incorporated in the corresponding schrdinger equation determine the heavy quarkonium spectra with no ambiguity .",
    "these masses involved in the potential model are denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "such the mass should be distinguished from the pole mass which is a purely perturbative concept defined unambiguously at each order of perturbation theory through the pole of the perturbative heavy quark propagator .",
    "thus , we need to test the consistency of estimates for the masses in the qcd potential of static quarks and in sr , say .    in section 2",
    "we generalize the bt approach to three loops and derive the static potential of heavy quarks .",
    "the numerical values of potential parameters and their consistency with the relevant quantities are considered .",
    "the implications for the heavy quark masses , spectra of heavy quarkonia and leptonic constants are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in conclusion .",
    "in this section , first , we discuss two regimes for the qcd forces between the static heavy quarks : the asymptotic freedom and confinement .",
    "second , we formulate how they can be combined in a unified @xmath5 function obeyed both limits of small and large qcd couplings .",
    "the static potential is defined in a manifestly gauge invariant way by means of the vacuum expectation value of a wilson loop @xcite , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is taken as a rectangular loop with time extension @xmath15 and spatial extension @xmath6 .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath16 are path - ordered along the loop , while the color trace is normalized according to @xmath17 .    generally , one introduces the v scheme of qcd coupling constant by the definition of qcd potential of static quarks in momentum space as follows : @xmath18 while @xmath4 can be matched with @xmath19 @xmath20 at present , our knowledge of this expansion is restricted by @xmath21 which is the well - known one - loop result , and the recent two - loop calculations @xcite , which gave @xmath22 we have used here the ordinary notations for the su(@xmath23 ) gauge group : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . the number of active flavors is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "after the introduction of @xmath28 , the @xmath5 function is actually defined by @xmath29 so that @xmath30 and @xmath31 the coefficients of @xmath5 function , calculated in the @xmath0 scheme @xcite are given by @xmath32 the fourier transform results in the position - space potential @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 . defining the new running coupling constant , depending on the distance , @xmath35",
    "we can calculate its @xmath5-function from ( [ vr ] ) , so that @xcite @xmath36 and the minor coefficients @xmath37 are equal to the scheme - independent values given above .    to normalize the couplings , we use ( [ vms ] ) at @xmath38 .",
    "the nonperturbative behaviour of qcd forces between the static heavy quarks at long distances @xmath6 is usually represented by the linear potential ( see discussion in ref.@xcite ) @xmath39 which corresponds to the square - law limit for the wilson loop .",
    "we can represent this potential in terms of constant chromoelectric field between the sources posed in the fundamental representation of su(@xmath23 ) .",
    "so , in the fock - schwinger gauge of fixed point @xmath40 we can represent the gluon field by means of strength tensor @xcite @xmath41 so that for the static quarks separated by the distance @xmath42 @xmath43 where the heavy quark fields are normalized to unit",
    ". then , the confining potential is written down as @xmath44 supposing , that the same strength of the field is responsible for the forming of gluon condensate , and introducing the colored sources @xmath45 , which have to be averaged in the vacuum , we can easily find @xcite @xmath46 where we have supposed the relation @xmath47 which ensures that the sources conserve the massless of the gluon , and , hence , the gauge invariance$ ] , so that the averaging of sources yields zero , if we suppose ( [ aver ] ) . ] .",
    "further , it is evident that @xmath48 then , we conclude that the relation between the strength @xmath49 and the string tension depends on the normalization of vacuum sources @xmath45 .",
    "we put @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the number of light flavors , which is the free parameter of such the representation .",
    "of course , the value of @xmath51 should be finite even in the case of pure gluodynamics with no light quarks in the infrared region .",
    "moreover , the light quark loops could cause the breaking of gluon string , i.e. the strong decays of higher excitations .",
    "we assume that @xmath51 is basically determined by the gluon dynamics ( i.e. the number of colors ) , and it slightly correlates with the number of quark flavors .",
    "after a simple consideration of potential strength between two colored sources in the fundamental and adjoint representations , i.e. the color factors in front of single gluon coulomb potential , we assume that in the pure gluodynamics the number of stochastic sources substituting for the vacuum gluons can be accepted in the form @xmath52 where the factor @xmath53 normalizes the source to unit , and @xmath54 is the appropriate ratio of color charges . to the moment ,",
    "the shift of @xmath51 in qcd with light quarks is not explicitly fixed , while the lattice calculations shown that the dependence of string tension on the number of light quarks is weak @xcite .",
    "finally , we find for the linear term of the potential @xmath55 the @xmath56 term is usually represented through a parameter @xmath57 as @xmath58 buchmller and tye put @xmath59 gev@xmath60 , which we use throughout of this paper .",
    "this value of tension , that is related with a slope of regge trajectories , can be compared with the estimate following from ( [ cond ] ) . at @xmath61",
    "gev@xmath62 @xcite we have found @xmath63 which is in a good agreement with the fixed value can change the appropriate value of gluon condensate . ]",
    ".    the form of ( [ conf ] ) corresponds to the limit , when at low virtualities @xmath64 the coupling @xmath4 tends to @xmath65 so that @xmath66 which gives the confinement asymptotics for the @xmath67 function .",
    "a special comment should be done on the role of linear term in the potential .",
    "considering the power corrections , which can be attributed to various sources such as the renormalon , topological effects caused by monopoles and vorteces , deviations from the operator product expansion , the authors of @xcite argued that this term responsible for the quark confinement can contribute at short distances , too .",
    "this conclusion is essentially different from the point of view based on the notion about a low energy phase transition leading to the condensation of gluons and quarks .",
    "this condensation provides the forming of chromoelectric string between the static quarks .",
    "thus , at short distances ( or high virtualities @xmath68 ) one could expect the decomposition of condensates , that means the scale of confinement ( or the string tension ) should disappear from the physical quantities at large @xmath68 . in contrast , the nonperturbative scale can contribute as the factor in front of power corrections @xmath69 even at @xmath70 .",
    "so , in @xcite several indications of linear term contribution at small distances were considered .",
    "we repeat the items relevant to the question on the static potential here .",
    "first , the lattice simulation @xcite does not show any change in the slope of the full @xmath71 potential as the distances are changed from the largest to the smallest ones where the coulombic part becomes dominant .",
    "hence , no rapid energy jump , characteristic for the phase transition , is found on the lattice .",
    "an explicit subtraction of the perturbative corrections at small distances from the potential in the lattice gluodynamics was performed in @xcite .",
    "this procedure gives an essential nonzero linear term at very small distances .",
    "second , there are the lattice measurements @xcite of the fine splitting in the heavy quarkonium levels as a function of the heavy quark mass .",
    "the approach by voloshin and leutwyler @xcite predicts a particular pattern of such the dependence .",
    "indeed , the multipole expansion of heavy quarkonium interaction with the external gluon field leads to the dominant contribution by the second order of chromoelectric dipole .",
    "therefore , the quark distance squared appears as the leading term in the perturbation due to soft gluons at short distances .",
    "these predictions are very different from the evaluations based on the static quark potential with the linear term , such as the potential by buchmller and tye @xcite .",
    "the numerical results from the lattice simulations favor the linear correction to the potential at short distances .",
    "third , an interesting manifestation of short strings might be the power corrections to current correlation functions @xmath72 .",
    "calculations of a relevant coefficient in front of the @xmath69 terms involve the model assumptions .",
    "so , in @xcite it was suggested to simulate this power correction by a tachyonic gluon mass .",
    "the tachyonic mass can imitate the stringy piece in the potential at short distances .",
    "rather unexpectedly , the use of the tachyonic gluon mass ( @xmath73 ) explains well the behavior of @xmath72 in various channels .",
    "this fact implies again we see the confirmation of short distance linear term in the potential .",
    "thus , we do not involve any additional assumptions on the possible scale and properties of quark - gluon condensate decomposition at short distances in the description of static potential in qcd .",
    "buchmller and tye supposed the following procedure for the reconstruction of @xmath5 function in the whole region of charge variation by the known limits of asymptotic freedom to a given order in @xmath74 and confinement regime .",
    "so , in the framework of asymptotic perturbative theory ( pt ) to one loop , the @xmath75 is transformed to the richardson one , @xmath76\\right)}. \\label{rich}\\ ] ] the richardson function has the essential peculiarity at @xmath77 , so that the expansion is the asymptotic series in @xmath78 . at @xmath79",
    "the @xmath5 function tends to the confinement limit represented in ( [ lim - c ] ) .    to the two loop accuracy , following in the same way results in the @xmath5 function by buchmller ",

    "remember , that at @xmath100 the perturbative expression ( [ 3pt ] ) becomes valid as the limit of effective charge ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "to the moment we are ready to discuss the numerical values of parameters .",
    "as we have already mentioned the slope of regge trajectories , determining the linear part of potential , is fixed as @xmath101 we use also the measured value of qcd coupling constant @xcite and pose @xmath102 as the basic input of the potential .    at the given choice of normalization value for the qcd coupling constant",
    "we get the scale @xmath103 mev , which certainly differs from the world average value resulted in the analysis of pdg @xcite , where @xmath104 mev , that corresponds to the coupling constant @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "however , this average value including various data is generally determined by the most precise measurements : the data on the hadronic events in the peak of @xmath8 boson at lep ( the hadronic width ) , the decays of @xmath106 lepton , the data on the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) for leptons off nucleons and the lattice simulations for the systems of heavy quarkonia . in this set of estimates ,",
    "the high energy measurements at lep for @xmath8 and at hera for the evolution of nucleon structure functions give the average values @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively , while the evolution of structure functions at low virtualities , where an ambiguity in the description of nonperturbative effects and contributions of higher twists are essential , as well as the energy - dependent sum rules for the structure functions at low energies significantly displace down the common average value for the coupling constant extracted from the dis data .",
    "thus , we argue that the methodical uncertainty for such the averaging is underestimated , since the low - energy data have got some little calculated sources of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the analysis of data on the decays of @xmath106 lepton resulting in @xmath109 , is based on the sum rules , where the control of nonperturbative corrections is much better than in dis , though there are some theoretical problems on the formulation of sum rules in the region of physical states in contrast with the classic variant of sum rules in the deep euclidean region .",
    "finally , the lattice simulations investigate the splitting between the states of heavy quarkonia , i.e. they operate with the low - energy data and rely on the approximation with the zero number of light quarks @xmath110 or @xmath111 under the extrapolation to both the real number of @xmath112 and the region of high virtualities due to the evolution .",
    "a high accuracy of such lattice estimates is announced .",
    "as we have seen the spectroscopic characteristics for the systems of heavy quarks need an extremely careful interpretation , since the evolution of potential parameters from the region of bound states to the high virtualities is affected by the nonperturbative factors .",
    "thus , we see that the normalization value of qcd coupling constant accepted above agrees with the direct high - energy measurements , while the data obtained at low energies allow the agreement , if we take into account their systematic uncertainties , which are not well estimated .",
    "note that the decrease of normalization value to @xmath113 , for example , leads to the discrepancy with the data on the splitting of heavy quarkonium masses between the levels of @xmath9 and @xmath10 states , which is very sensitive to the normalization of qcd coupling constant , so that instead of @xmath114 mev we get the value which is less by about @xmath115 mev . in this respect",
    ", the variation of other dimensional parameter , the regge trajectory slope , from the accepted value of @xmath116 gev@xmath60 to @xmath117 gev@xmath60 leads to unessential change in both the splitting and the corresponding value for the scale in the coupling constant evolved to low virtualities .",
    "then , we evaluate @xmath118 and put it as the normalization point for @xmath119 .",
    "further , we find the following values of @xmath87 for the effective charge , depending on the number of active flavors : @xmath120 where we set the threshold values for the switching the number of flavors to be equal to @xmath121 gev and @xmath122 gev .",
    "after such the fixing the momentum space dependence of the charge , we perform the fourier transform to get @xmath123 with @xmath124 which is calculated numerically at @xmath125 fm and represented in the mathematica file in the format of notebook at the site http://www.ihep.su/@xmath126kiselev/potential.nb .",
    "note , that at short distances the potential behaviour is purely perturbative , so that at @xmath127 fm we put @xmath128 where the running @xmath129 is given by eq.([3pt ] ) with the appropriate value of @xmath130 at @xmath131 , and with the matching with the potential ( [ r < ] ) at @xmath132 fm , where we have found @xmath133 which implies @xmath134 mev .",

    "the visual deviation between the qcd potential derived and the cornell model at long distances is caused by a numerical difference in the choice of string tension : we adopt the value given by buchmller and tye , while in the cornell model the tension is slightly greater than that of we have used .",
    "a more essential point is the deviation between the potentials at short distances ( see fig .",

    "the contributions related with the confinement regime are essential .",
    "two comments are to the point .",
    "first , the resulting potential is obtained by the perturbative normalization to the measured value of @xmath142 as combined with the three - loop evolution to the lower virtualities .",
    "second , the running of coupling constant is modified ( numerically the deviation from the perturbative regime begins at @xmath143 gev ) to reach the confinement limit at @xmath144 , so that the perturbative connection between the scales @xmath87 and @xmath145 is broken at virtualities under touch by the charmed and bottom quarks , that was the reason for the error in the assignment of @xmath145 by buchmller and tye .",
    "considering the characteristics of heavy quark bound states we should emphasize a significant necessity to certainly separate two distinct theoretical problems .",
    "the first problem is the calculation of heavy quark potential , where the leading approximation is the static limit of @xmath146 in the operator product expansion over the powers of inverse heavy quark mass .",
    "we have considered this problem in the previous section .",
    "the other problem is the calculation of bound state masses . in the heavy quarkonium",
    "the kinetic energy of quark motion is comparable with the potential energy .",
    "so , the leading approximation for the effective lagrangian in the operator product expansion over the inverse heavy quark mass is the sum of nonrelativistic kinetic term and the static potential , which give the dominant contribution in the schrdinger equation for the bound states .",
    "corrections are relativistic terms in the kinetic energy and perturbations of the static potential in the form of operators suppressed by the inverse powers of heavy quark mass , as well as nonpotential retardation effects . the magnitude of such the corrections can be restricted numerically , that leads to a systematic uncertainty in the calculations of mass spectra for the heavy quarkonia in the framework of potential approach with the static potential .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ excit ]    finally , we present the ratios of leptonic constants for the excited @xmath151-levels of @xmath164 and @xmath165 in table [ excit ] in comparison with the experimental data . we see that the predictions are in a good agreement with the measured values . for completeness , we predict also the constant of @xmath10-level in the @xmath166 system @xmath167 which agrees with the scaling relation @xcite .",
    "thus , we have analyzed the estimates following from the potential of static quarks in qcd for the masses of quarks and heavy quarkonia as well as for the leptonic constants , and found both the good agreement with the experimental data available and the consistency with the qcd sum rules .",
    "we have derived the potential of static heavy quarks in qcd on the base of known limits at short and long distances : the asymptotic freedom to the three loop accuracy and the confinement regime .",
    "the inputs of potential are the coefficients of perturbative @xmath5 function , the matching of @xmath168 scheme with the v scheme of potential , the normalization of running coupling constant of qcd at @xmath169 and the slope of regge trajectories , determining the linear term in the potential .",
    "thus , the approach by buchmller and tye has been modified in accordance with the current status of perturbative calculations .    in the static limit the two - loop improvement of coulomb potential results in the significant correction to the @xmath5 function for the effective charge , @xmath170 as shown in fig .",
    "this correction is important for the determination of critical values of charge , i.e. the value in the intermediate region between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes .",
    "moreover , the two - loop matching condition and the three - loop running of coupling constant normalized by the data at the high energy of @xmath171 determine the region of energetic scale for changing the regimes mentioned above .",
    "this scale strongly correlates with the data on the mass spectra of heavy quarkonia .",
    "so , it is connected with the splitting of masses between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 levels .",
    "we stress that the consistent consideration of two - loop improvement gives the appropriate value of effective coulomb coupling constant as it was fitted in the cornell model of potential .",
    "this is achieved in the present paper in contrast to the one - loop consideration by buchmller and tye , who found the value of @xmath172 inconsistent with the current normalization at high energies .",
    "so , the two - loop improvement gives the correct normalization of effective coulomb exchange at the distances characteristic for the average separation between the heavy quarks inside the heavy quarkonium and determines the deviations at short distances @xmath173 fm ( see fig .",
    "[ diffcornell ] ) , that is important in the calculations of leptonic constants related with the wave functions at the origin .",
    "other corrections to the potential of heavy quarks are connected with the finite mass effects and can not be treated in the framework of static approximation .",
    "for example , the spin - dependent forces , relativistic corrections and specific non - abelian potential terms with the factor given by the inverse heavy quark masses .",
    "] in the heavy quarkonium should be taken in the analysis of mass spectra .",
    "a magnitude of leading nonstatic corrections can be evaluated by the characteristic shifts of levels due to the hyper - fine splitting of @xmath174-wave levels in the heavy quarkonia .",
    "so , we conservatively evaluate the uncertainty of heavy quark mass analysis @xmath175 mev .",
    "thus , the non - abelian term of potential @xmath176 , say , has the factors in the form of @xmath177 , and it is equal to zero in the static limit @xmath178 , while the uncertainty in the heavy quark masses due to the omission of such the terms is estimated in the paragraph above . formally , if we consider the perturbation theory for the calculation of bound state levels in the heavy quarkonium with the coulomb functions taken as the leading approximation , which is not a scope of our consideration , then the mentioned non - abelian potential contributes in the same order in @xmath74 as the two - loop corrections to the matching of perturbative static potential @xmath179 , since the averaging of @xmath180 results in @xmath181 factor .",
    "however , the two - loop effects are important for the consistent consideration of static potential and the high energy normalization , i.e. these corrections are significant in the running of effective charge in the potential from the high energies to the scale relevant to the heavy quark bound states even in the static limit , while the nonstatic contributions can be consistently neglected in the numerical analysis .",
    "we see that our consideration is consistent in the static approximation , which we have addressed in the present paper .",
    "the matching of two loop perturbative potential with the qcd potential of static quarks has been performed to get estimates of heavy quark masses , which can be compared with the results of qcd sum rules .",
    "a good agreement between two approaches has been found .",
    "the recent determinations of heavy quark masses in refs . @xcite were done in the framework of qcd sum rules , which is a systematic approach , indeed .",
    "it is based on the separation of short - distance region from the nonperturbative effects at some values of parameters defining the scheme of calculations in the sum rules .",
    "in this approach the nonperturbative terms are given in the form of quark - gluon condensates contributing with corresponding short - distance wilson coefficients , so that as was shown in @xcite , a numerical contribution of gluon condensate term in the sum rules is negligibly small in comparison with the perturbative part .",
    "however , it would be incorrect to think that these explicit contributions suppressed in some region of parameters are the only terms caused by the nonperturbative infrared dynamics of qcd . indeed , neglecting the condensate terms , we find that the perturbative correlators suffer from the renormalon ambiguity , which implies that the perturbative expansion in series of @xmath74 is asymptotic , and the summation of series depends on a method used .",
    "the physical reason for such the divergency and ambiguity is the infrared singularity in the qcd coupling constant .",
    "this singularity is regularized by introducing the threshold mass parameters free of renormalon .",
    "such the approach is independent of any assumptions on the gluon condensate , since , generally the pole mass renormalon and the gluon condensates are different issues .",
    "so , the perturbative pole mass used in the qcd sum rules is not well defined quantity , and some relevant quantities are introduced in refs .",
    "these quantities are constructed from the perturbative pole mass of heavy quark with specific infrared subtractions , which are treated independently of the quark - gluon condensates .",
    "these constructions are author - dependent . though the authors of subtracted masses gave some physical motivations , which are more or less strict , but justified .",
    "these infrared subtractions imply the introduction of infrared regulators .    in the present paper the unified @xmath5 function for the effective charge in the potential",
    "is considered , and its definition supposes the infrared stability .",
    "thus , we see that the analysis of heavy quark masses in both the qcd sum rules and potential approach involves the consideration of relevant effects caused by the infrared dynamics of qcd , though the explicit constructive procedures are certainly different , but they have similar inherent uncertainties .    the calculated mass spectra of heavy quarkonia and the leptonic constants of vector @xmath151-levels are in agreement with the measured values .",
    "the characteristics of @xmath182 meson have been predicted .",
    "the authors are grateful to prof .",
    "a.k.likhoded and a.l.kataev for stimulating discussions and a.a.pivovarov for clarifying the results of qcd sum rules on the @xmath183-quark mass .",
