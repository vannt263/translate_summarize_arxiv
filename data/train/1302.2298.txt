    "currently , there is much effort devoted to finding efficient numerical techniques for strongly correlated electrons . amongst several approaches , the density matrix renormalization group (",
    "dmrg)@xcite has provided many new insights in challenging systems . in recent years",
    ", efficient dmrg implementations have also appeared for quantum chemistry.@xcite originally , the dmrg was formulated as an algorithm in the language of wilson s numerical renormalization group .",
    "however , more recently , attention has expanded to the underlying class of wavefunctions optimized by the dmrg , which are the matrix product states ( mps ) .",
    "mps provide a compact description of entanglement in 1d systems , thus dmrg calculations for chain - like molecules are very efficient.@xcite however , when used in 2d and 3d systems , much larger bond - dimensions , usually denoted by @xmath1 and referred to as the number of renormalized states in dmrg calculations , must be used to reach a target accuracy .",
    "the need for larger @xmath1 reflects the sub - optimal representation of 2d and 3d entanglement by the mps wavefunction structure .",
    "the generalization of mps to tensor network states ( tns ) provides a natural way to compactly describe 2d and 3d entanglement .",
    "there are several families of tns that differ in the way the entanglement is encoded , and a brief overview of the classes of tns is given in refs .",
    ". while the formal properties of general tns are appealing , efficient computation with these states lags far behind computation with mps . in this work ,",
    "we explore efficient computation for quantum chemistry with tree tensor network states ( ttns),@xcite one of the simplest families of tns .",
    "ttns encode a tree entanglement structure , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bethe_tree ] .",
    "a tree of maximal degree @xmath2 has at most @xmath2 neighbours at any site .",
    "mps are a special case of ttns with @xmath3 .",
    "the absence of cycles in a ttns simplifies many algorithms .",
    "in particular , the variational minimization of ttns wavefunctions can be carried out by generalizing the dmrg algorithm used for mps , from a two - block formulation , to a @xmath2-block formulation .",
    "multi - block dmrg algorithms have been studied for some time,@xcite although to the best of our knowledge , their interpretation in terms of the underlying class of ttns variational states first appeared in ref .  .",
    "thus , ref .   can be considered as a starting point for the current work .    in ref .",
    "the authors considered a prototype application of ttns to quantum chemistry with a minimal basis beryllium atom calculation .",
    "although this provided evidence that for a given @xmath1 , ttns of degree @xmath4 capture more entanglement than the corresponding mps with the same @xmath1 , for practical computation many questions were left unanswered .",
    "for example , although ttns are more flexible than mps for describing entanglement , there is an implicit trade - off of higher computational scaling with @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the calculation in ref .",
    "used an unrealistically small @xmath5 , whereas typical dmrg calculations use @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the relevance of ttns for quantum chemistry calculations remains to be established .",
    "in the current work , we address this question by describing and implementing an efficient ttns algorithm that can be used for realistic calculations .",
    "our algorithm is formulated to have an optimal computational scaling for quantum chemistry hamiltonians .",
    "we achieve a much lower cost than earlier formulations through a `` half''-renormalization transformation which exactly maps the multi - block dmrg to a conventional , efficient , two - block dmrg .",
    "we also address the issue of orbital ordering on trees which is necessary to use ttns in chemistry . using our efficient implementation",
    ", we assess the performance of ttns relative to mps used in quantum chemistry dmrg calculations .",
    "we compare ttns and mps on several benchmark molecular systems , including ideal hydrogen trees and chains , and benchmark molecules such as the nitrogen and chromium dimers .",
    "finally , to demonstrate the power of ttns , we carry out complete active space calculations in @xmath0-conjugated dendrimer molecules , correlating up to 110 electrons in 110 orbitals",
    ".     examples of trees .",
    "the left panel shows a tree with degree @xmath7 and depth @xmath8 , and the right panel shows a tree with degree @xmath9 and depth @xmath10 . ]",
    "we first present a brief overview of mps wavefunctions and the dmrg algorithm that optimizes their energy . this will allow us to establish basic notation which will be used to discuss ttns in the next section .",
    "however , as the presentation is not entirely self - contained , for further details we refer to additional articles and reviews.@xcite    we use the following notation for mps : @xmath11 is the many - body basis at site _",
    "i _ , _ k _ is number of sites , and _",
    "m _ is the number of renormalized states .",
    "the ( one - site ) mps wavefunction is obtained by expressing the coefficient of the determinant @xmath12 as a product of matrices for each occupancy @xmath13 , @xmath14 for an mps with @xmath1 renormalized states , the matrices are of maximum dimension @xmath15 , except for the first and last , which are of maximum dimension @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "note that the mps is invariant to a number of transformations of the matrices.@xcite we remove this invariance by choosing an mps _",
    "canonical form_. in the canonical form at site @xmath18 , the rotation matrices to the left of site @xmath18 are constrained to satisfy orthonormality conditions @xmath19 , while those to the right of site @xmath18 are constrained to satisfy @xmath20 .",
    "the left and right rotation matrices allow us to define left and right renormalized many - body states , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "these renormalized representations are used to construct the computational intermediates ( renormalized operators ) in the dmrg algorithm . carrying out the matrix multiplications from @xmath23 through @xmath24 , and from @xmath25 through @xmath26",
    ", we obtain @xmath27 the orthonormality conditions on the rotation matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 imply that the renormalized bases are orthonormal @xmath30    the dmrg ( canonical ) form of the mps wavefunction is obtained by rewriting the mps wavefunction ( [ eq : dmrg_wfu_mps ] ) in terms of the renormalized many - body bases @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath31 in this interpretation , @xmath32 is viewed as a wavefunction coefficient vector in a hilbert space spanned by the renormalized product states , @xmath33 .",
    "computations using mps involve tensor - tensor contractions . to express such operations , it is helpful to use a graphical representation , shown in figure  [ fig : mps_graph_rep ] .",
    "each vertex is a tensor and the number of edges connected to the vertex determines the tensor rank . in the case of an mps , each @xmath34 or @xmath35 is a rank-3 tensor , represented by a vertex with three edges . here",
    ", we always choose the vertical index to represent @xmath11 .",
    "the mps wavefunction is obtained by contracting the horizontal edges of all the tensors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mps_graph_rep ] ( b ) ) , leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmrg_wfu_mps ] ) .",
    "the computation of the overlap of two mps is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mps_graph_rep ] ( c ) .",
    "we optimize the mps energy , by minimizing the lagrangian @xmath36 with respect to the tensors in the mps . in the ( one - site )",
    "dmrg sweep algorithm , this minimization is carried out with respect to a single tensor at a time . in step @xmath18 of the dmrg sweep ,",
    "the mps is expressed in the dmrg form ( [ eq : dmrg_wfu_i ] ) , and the coefficient vector @xmath37 is optimized , holding the rotation matrices to the left and right of the site which define the bases @xmath21 , @xmath38 , fixed .",
    "because the energy is a quadratic form in @xmath37 , minimization leads to a standard eigenvalue problem , @xmath39 in subsequent steps of the sweep , the mps is transformed to the dmrg form at successive sites , and the coefficient vectors at these sites are optimized .",
    "the most expensive operation in the sweep is computing @xmath40 and performing @xmath41 to solve the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : eig ] ) .",
    "this is because the second - quantized hamiltonian contains a large number of terms , @xmath42 and for each term we need its matrix representation in the basis @xmath43 .",
    "there are two generic strategies to handle the large number of terms .",
    "the first , used in existing quantum chemistry dmrg implementations , is through _ complementary operators_.@xcite the second uses the more recent concept of _ matrix product operators_.@xcite        complementary operators are a way to maximize the reuse of intermediates . for example , there are @xmath44 terms in the summation ( [ eq : ham2nd ] ) , and each expectation value individually is of @xmath45 cost , leading to a naive scaling of @xmath46 for the energy .",
    "however , much information can be reused between terms .",
    "for example , the two terms @xmath47 and @xmath48 involve the same partial expectation value over @xmath49 .",
    "complementary operators reuse and combine such partial traces . at site @xmath18 in the dmrg sweep",
    ", we partition the hilbert space into two subspaces : a , containing the left block of sites ( sites @xmath50 ) and site @xmath18 , spanned by renormalized states @xmath51 , and b , containing the right block of sites @xmath52 , and spanned by renormalized states @xmath38 .",

    "@xmath57 describes the interactions between a and b , and is given by a sum of products acting separately on the two spaces @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the _ complementary operators _ , @xmath62 using complementary operators , the total complexity of evaluating @xmath63 and performing @xmath64 is reduced to @xmath65 per sweep , including the cost of constructing the components of @xmath53 in the partitioned form ( renormalization).@xcite this is the standard procedure to evaluate the energy in the dmrg algorithm .        an alternative approach to handle complicated hamiltonians is through _ matrix product operators _ ( mpo ) .",
    "mpo s provide a convenient way to reason about operators in mps algorithms and have been employed extensively in time - dependent mps simulations.@xcite here we provide a brief analysis of this approach for quantum chemistry .",
    "the basic idea in an mpo is extend the matrix product like representation to operators .",

    "to decompose @xmath53 exactly , the dimension of the horizontal edge of @xmath68}$ ] needs to be exactly the same as the number of complementary operators , that is @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , the cost of computing the expectation value @xmath63 with an mpo representation becomes @xmath70 .",
    "note that this cost is _ larger _ than in the complementary operator approach .",
    "the difference arises because we have not considered the sparsity of the individual @xmath68}$ ] tensors that arise in the hamiltonian decomposition .",
    "however , incorporating element - wise sparsity into an mpo algorithm eliminates much of the conceptual and algorithmic simplicity of the mpo approach .",
    "consequently , in our view , the complementary operator algorithm is a more practical and efficient route for mps computations with quantum chemistry hamiltonians .",
    "the relative benefit of using complementary operators versus tensor product operators ( tpo s ) is even greater for ttns than for mps , thus we focus on the complementary operator approach when considering trees .",
    "tensor network states ( tns ) are mathematical generalizations of the mps that can code more general entanglement networks .",
    "the form of a tns wavefunction is directly analogous to an mps wavefunction , @xmath71 \\ket{n_{1} ... n_{k}},\\ ] ] the only difference being that @xmath72 is now a tensor , rather than a rotation matrix as in the mps , and the multiplication operator @xmath73 together with @xmath74 denotes a general contraction over tensor indices .",
    "the flexibility of tns wavefunctions arises from the fact that whereas the matrices in an mps can only be contracted along a 1d - lattice , there are many different ways to connect general tensors together to form a network of entanglement .    ) , and right panel shows the one - site wavefunction spanned by the renormalized basis , as described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttns_1site ] ) . note that physical indices ( vertical bonds ) are omitted in the right panel . ]",
    "_ tree tensor network states ( ttns ) _ are a special class of tns where the tensors are connected as a tree as shown in figure  [ fig : ttns_graph_rep ] .",
    "a tree is a graph that has no loops , which leads to many simplifying mathematical properties that parallel those of a mps ( indeed , an mps is simply a tree with @xmath3 legs ) . for example , at a given site @xmath18 in the tree , we can define renormalized bases for each of the @xmath2 legs connected to the site .",
    "this allows use to rewrite ( [ eq : ttns ] ) as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the renormalized basis in the @xmath77-th branch of site @xmath18 .",
    "this basis is defined by recursively contracting tensors in the branch from the leaves up to site @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath76 is obtained as @xmath78 where sites @xmath79 are adjacent to @xmath18 in the branch .",
    "note that for a @xmath2 degree ttns with @xmath1 renormalized states , the tensor @xmath80 has @xmath81 elements .",
    "analogous to the rotation matrices in mps , the tensors @xmath72 in a given branch around site @xmath18 can be chosen to satisfy orthonormality constraints , rendering the ttns in canonical form , @xmath82 as a result , the renormalized basis states @xmath76 are orthonormal .",
    "the above mathematical properties make a dmrg energy optimization algorithm for ttns very similar to that for mps .",
    "similarly to the dmrg algorithm for mps , we optimize one site at a time .",
    "the ttns is expressed in canonical form around site @xmath18 , then the coefficient tensor @xmath32 is optimized , and the sites of the tree are traversed during the sweep .",
    "the computational challenge is once again how to efficiently compute the representation of the hamiltonian in the renormalized bases , namely @xmath83 , and its action on the coefficient vector @xmath32 , @xmath41 . as we discussed for the case of mps , for quantum chemistry",
    "hamiltonians the complementary operator approach is most natural .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian in complementary operator form by partitioning into @xmath84 blocks , a , b , c , d , and so on , corresponding to the @xmath2 branches around site @xmath18 , and site @xmath18 itself .",
    "the hamiltonian is re - expressed in terms of operators acting on each of the blocks separately , @xmath85 where ,          as in the case of mps , the full matrix representation of @xmath53 is never built explicitly as the storage requirements would be immense . instead",
    "only @xmath41 is computed in the davidson algorithm .",
    "note that when computing @xmath41 the order of multiplication of the various terms in the complementary operator decomposition of @xmath53 is important .",
    "for example , the term @xmath89 in which a and c are large blocks with @xmath90 sites and _ m _ renormalized states ( indices @xmath91 and @xmath92 below ) and b is the site being optimized , with 4 states ( index @xmath11 below ) should be computed as    @xmath93 \\otimes [ \\hat{a}_{j}^{b } ] \\otimes [ \\hat{p}_{ij}^{c\\dag } ] \\boldsymbol{\\psi}^{n_{i } }   = \\sum_{i\\in{a},b_{1 } } [ \\hat{a}_{i}^{a}]^{b'_{1}b_{1 } }   \\left(\\sum_{b_{2},n_{i } } \\psi_{b_{1}b_{2} ... b_{z}}^{n_{i } }   \\left(\\sum_{j\\in{b } } [ \\hat{a}_{j}^{b}]^{n'_{i}n_{i } } [ \\hat{p}_{ij}^{c\\dag}]^{b'_{2}b_{2}}\\right)\\right).\\ ] ]                                          . legeza , t. rohwedder and r. schneider , _ numerical approaches for high - dimensional pde s for quantum chemistry _ in _ encyclopedia of applied and computational mathematics _ , b. engquist ( ed . ) , springer ( 2012 )"
