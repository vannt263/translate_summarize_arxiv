    "investigating the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the important topics in the modern astrophysics .",
    "especially , it is interesting to study how cold gas is converted to stars in galaxies at the very early phase of evolution . to investigate the very early phase of the galaxy evolution",
    ", we focus on two populations that are thought to be gas - rich young systems , the damped ly@xmath0 absorption system ( dla ) and the ly@xmath0 emitter ( lae ) .",
    "the dla is a class of quasar absorption - line systems , which has a column density of @xmath12 @xmath2 ( wolfe et al .",
    "the dla provides a powerful tool to investigate the nature of the cold gas at high-@xmath13 because they trace the intervening gas along the line - of - sight to quasars and can be detected as a strong ly@xmath0 absorption line on quasar spectra regardless of the luminosity of their stellar component . since dlas dominate the neutral - gas content in a wide redshift range ( storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2005 ) , they are thought to be gas reservoirs for the star - formation in the high-@xmath13 universe .",
    "though the dla is such an important population , their nature is still under the debate ( e.g. , prochaska & wolfe 1997 ; taniguchi & shioya 2000 ; 2001 ; kacprzak et al .",
    "2010 ) because it is often difficult to identify their optical counterparts due to their faintness , especially at high redshift ( see for recent identifications at @xmath14 , fynbo et al . 2010 ; 2011 ; 2013 ; proux et al . 2011 ; 2012 ; bouch et al .",
    "2013 ; krogager et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 , kashikawa et al .",
    "2014 , srianand et al . 2016 ; sommer - larsen & fynbo 2017 and references therein ) .",
    "in many cases , counterparts of high-@xmath13 dlas have been found as laes .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the nature of dlas is young gas - rich galaxy .",
    "the lae is a population of galaxies selected by their strong ly@xmath0 emission . since typical laes show faint uv continuum and large ly@xmath0 equivalent width ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "it is considered that they are young galaxies ( e.g. , malhotra & rhoads 2002 , taniguchi et al .",
    "2005 ; shimasaku et al . 2005 ; kashikawa et al . 2006 ; gawiser et al . 2007 ; nilsson et al . 2007 ; ono et al .",
    "2010b ; 2012 ) .",
    "so far , various researches to understand properties of laes have been conducted and found that their typical stellar mass is @xmath16 and the age is in order of 100  myr ( e.g. , gawiser et al . 2006 ; 2007 ; nilsson et al . 2009",
    "; ono et al .",
    "note that recently , some laes with more evolved stellar populations have been found ( e.g. , ono et al . 2010a ; taniguchi et al . 2015 ) .",
    "in addition , some sensitive radio observations of co molecular lines in high-@xmath13 galaxies suggest that the gas fraction is larger at higher redshifts , and sometimes the gas mass fraction reaches up to @xmath80.5 or even more ( e.g. , carilli & walter 2013 ; troncoso et al .",
    "therefore the lae as well as the dla at high @xmath13 is a key population to understand the early phase of the galaxy evolution .",
    "however , the relation between these two populations is still unclear .",
    "as we mention above , although most of dla counterparts at high @xmath13 show the ly@xmath0 emission , only few counterparts of high-@xmath13 dlas have been identified so far .",
    "given the idea that dlas are neutral gas reservoir for the star formation , the relation of the dlas and young galaxies ( i.e. , laes ) is interesting .",
    "it should be noted that dlas can be recognized only when they have a background quasar ( bgqso ) .",
    "the number density of such quasars had been too low to investigate grouping or clustering properties of dlas .",
    "however , such a situation has been recently changed after the data release of baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2011 ; dawson et al .",
    "the quasar catalog based on the boss data ( data release 9 of the sloan digital sky survey [ sdss dr9 ] ; ahn et al .",
    "2012 ) includes 87,822 quasars mainly at @xmath17 ( p^ aris et al .",
    "2012 ) . by utilizing the boss quasar sample , noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found 12,801 absorbers with @xmath18 ( partly including sub - dlas which are absorption - line systems with @xmath19 ; proux et al .",
    "this new and large absorber sample enables us to study the spatial distribution of dlas .    here , we focus on regions where some absorbers with a narrow redshift range are concentrated in a narrow area .",
    "such a region is interesting for following two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) such a region may harbor large amount of neutral gas and thus it may correspond to the region where galaxies are rapidly evolving , and ( 2 ) to observe such a region , we can effectively search for counterparts of absorbers . by observing laes around such a region , we can investigate the relation of gas - rich systems and young galaxies .",
    "for this purpose , wide - field narrow - band ( nb ) observations are very useful . by combining nb filters and imaging instruments with a wide field - of - view",
    ", we can effectively observe laes in a wide area .    in this paper",
    ", we report our observational trial for studying properties of laes around a concentrated region of strong ly@xmath0 absorbers to investigate very early stage of the galaxy evolution based on the nb imaging observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the target field selection and imaging observations of laes .",
    "the results are given in section 3 .",
    "we discuss interpretations of the absorber concentrated region in section 4 .",
    "we present our conclusion in section 5 .",
    "we use a @xmath20 cdm cosmology with @xmath21  mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , throughout this paper .",
    "magnitudes are all given in the ab system .",
    "in this study , we focus on the j1230 + 34 field , where there are 2 dlas and 2 sub - dlas at @xmath25 within a cubic region of @xmath26 .",
    "table [ tab : info_j1230 ] shows the basic data of four absorbers , and figure [ fig : map_j1230 ] shows the sky distribution of the absorbers and quasars in the j1230 + 34 field .",
    "the boss spectra of quasars with a strong absorption in the target field is shown in figure [ fig : spdla ] .",
    "we selected this region from the catalog of strong ( @xmath18 ) ly@xmath0 absorbers based on the boss quasars ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "2012 ) .    here",
    ", we describe the selection process of the target field .",
    "first , we define the sample of absorbers and their bgqsos .",
    "the redshift distribution of the absorbers in the catalog shows its peak at @xmath272.2 ( figure [ fig : zdla ] ) .",
    "fortunately , there is a suitable narrow - band ( nb ) filter of suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al . 2002 ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope , @xmath5 , to observe the ly@xmath0 emission from objects around that redshift .",
    "@xmath5 is a custom - made nb filter whose central wavelength and width in full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) are 4003    and 92   , respectively .",
    "this wavelength coverage corresponds to the redshift range of @xmath28 for the ly@xmath0 emission ( 1216    in the rest frame ) .",
    "therefore , throughout this paper , we define the absorber sample as those at @xmath29 . as for the bgqsos , we set their redshift range to @xmath30",
    ". the lower limit of the redshift range for bgqsos is the same as that for absorbers , taking also into account of proximity dlas ( pdlas ; prochaska et al .",
    "the pdla is a population of dlas at a velocity separation of @xmath31 3,000 km  s@xmath22 from the bgqso ( prochaska et al .",
    "we determine the upper limit of the redshift of bgqsos by considering the lyman limit of bgqsos .",
    "since the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of a quasar spectrum is very low at the wavelength range shorter than the lyman limit ( 912    in the rest frame ) , it is difficult to find absorbers at this wavelength range",
    ". therefore we focus only on quasars at the redshift where their lyman limit locates at shorter wavelength than the @xmath5 coverage .",
    "we remove quasars with the balnicity index ( bi ; weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) @xmath321,000 km  s@xmath22 from the bgqso sample , because it is hard to distinguish ly@xmath0 absorbers from broad absorption lines ( bals ) in the intrinsic spectra of such bal quasars ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "2012 ) . among the boss quasar sample ( 87,822 quasars at the time of dr9 )",
    ", we regard 47,376 quasars as bgqsos for absorbers at @xmath28 . the number of absorbers at @xmath28 whose bgqsos satisfy the criteria is 824 .",
    "then we search for concentrated regions of strong ly@xmath0 absorbers based on this sample . here , we define the concentrated region as the region where there are three or more absorbers within a cubic space of @xmath33 .",
    "this definition is based on the typical size of galaxy proroclusters .",
    "overzier ( 2016 ) shows the redshift distribution of galaxies in several protoclusters which are confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "the width of redshift distribution of galaxies in protoclusters at @xmath34 is typically @xmath35 ( corresponding to @xmath36 mpc in the comoving scale ) .",
    "chiang et al . ( 2013 ) also summarized properties of observed protoclusters and most of them show @xmath37 ( corresponding to @xmath38 mpc in the comoving scale ) . as for the spatial extent of protoclusters",
    ", it is known that they could be extended up to dozens of mpc ( e.g. , hayashino et al .",
    "2004 ; prescott et al . 2008 ; lee et al .",
    "recently , franck and mcgaugh ( 2016 ) search for clusters and protoclusters over a wide redshift range ( @xmath39 ) , showing that almost all members of a cluster are covered with the circular region whose radius is @xmath820  mpc in the comoving scale .",
    "in addition , muldrew et al .",
    "( 2015 ) studied to define the high-@xmath13 protoclusters and found that 90% of a protocluster mass is extended across 50 comoving mpc at @xmath34 .",
    "taking considerations given above into account , we decide the search scale of ( 50  mpc)@xmath4 in this work , and define the concentrated regions of strong ly@xmath0 absorbers as the region with 3 or more absorbers within ( 50  mpc)@xmath4 .    as a result",
    ", we have found 6 absorber - concentrated regions in which there are at least 3 strong ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "table [ tab : concentration ] shows the basic data of absorbers in each region and figure [ fig : all_map ] shows the sky distribution of absorbers .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : concentration ] ( and also figure [ fig : all_map ] ) , all of selected fields have 3 absorbers .",
    "interestingly , there is one more absorber which is located at very close to 3 absorbers in the j1230 + 34 field .",
    "this absorber ( no . 4 in table [ tab : info_j1230 ] , figure [ fig : map_j1230 ] and [ fig : all_map ] ) is located within the 50 mpc @xmath40 50 mpc box on the sky . furthermore , the comoving distance along the line of sight from absorber no .",
    "4 to the nearest absorber ( no .",
    "2 ) is only 7.7 mpc and that between no . 4 and farthest absorber ( no .",
    "1 ) is 53.5 mpc . if considering also this absorber , there are more absorbers in the j1230 + 34 field than the other 5 fields , and thus this j1230 + 34 field is more interesting as an absorber - concentrated region than the other fields .",

    "one possible scenario is that the j1230 + 34 field harbors many young galaxies intrinsically , that are made from plenty of gas suggested by the concentration of strong absorbers .",
    "however , since there is a large amount of h  i gas around absorbers , the effect of the resonant scattering is serious .",

    "consequently , we may underestimate the ly@xmath0 @xmath9 and miss a large fraction of laes around absorbers . on the other hand , as we show in section 4.1 , we find a possible overdensity of laes around a dla with the highest @xmath11 in the target field while no overdensity is found around absorbers with smaller @xmath11 . at a glance",

    "however , we may explain both of the existence of lae overdensity around the dla with the highest @xmath11 and the lack of the number excess of laes around absorbers with lower @xmath11 as follows : ( 1 ) around high @xmath11 absorber , there are enough number of laes to detect the overdensity even though the effect of the resonant scattering is serious , and ( 2 ) around lower @xmath11 , although there are intrinsic number excess of laes , it is not enough to defeat the effect of resonant scattering . to examine this scenario , further h@xmath0",

    "if this scenario is the case , we will find the number excess of h@xmath0 emitters ( haes ) around absorbers .",
    "an alternative idea is that there are not so many galaxies in the target field even though there are many neutral gas .",
    "h  i gas is not converted stars directly but goes through the molecular clouds .",
    "thus , a large fraction of h  i gas may not be converted to stars . to discuss the star - formation process in the absorber - concentrated region , observations of molecular gas",
    "are required as well as h  i gas and galaxies .    furthermore , if we follow the idea that the origin of absorbers is the disk of galaxies , gas may not extend so widely . in this case",
    ", an absorber corresponds just to a galaxy and thus the absorber - concentrated region may not be a gas - rich region . although the fact that bgqsos ( a and b ) near absorber no.2 do not have absorbers at @xmath25 may support this idea , bgqso - a is at @xmath48 and thought to be a member of @xmath25 objects and we can not recognize absorbers @xmath25 on the spectra of bgqso - b .",
    "therefore , we can not discuss this possibility only with our current data .",

    "2015 ) and the subaru prime focus spectrograph ( pfs ) survey ( takada et al . 2014 ) will be available , the surface number density of bgqsos will increase significantly and accordingly we can tackle this problem .",

    "<S> in order to investigate the physical relationship between strong ly@xmath0 absorbers ( log@xmath1  @xmath2 ) such as damped ly@xmath0 absorption systems ( dlas ) and young star - forming galaxies at high redshift , we have conducted narrow - band observations of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) in a concentrated region of strong ly@xmath0 absorbers at @xmath3 , the j1230 + 34 field . using a catalog of ly@xmath0 absorbers with </S>",
    "<S> log@xmath1  @xmath2 based on the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , we found 6 fields where 3 or more absorbers are concentrated within a ( 50  mpc)@xmath4 cubic box in the comoving scale . among them , we focus on the j1230 + 34 field , where 2 dlas and 2 sub - dlas present . </S>",
    "<S> our narrow - band imaging observations with subaru / suprime - cam using a custom - made filter , @xmath5 ( @xmath6    and fwhm@xmath7   ) yield a sample of 149 laes in this field . in the large scale ( @xmath850 mpc ) </S>",
    "<S> , we have found no differences between the obtained ly@xmath0 luminosity function and those in the blank fields at similar redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the frequency distribution of the ly@xmath0 rest - frame equivalent width ( @xmath9 ) in the target field and other fields including both overdensity region and blank field , but find no differences . on the other hand , in the small scale ( @xmath810 mpc ) , we have found a possible overdensity of laes around a dla with the highest h  i column density ( @xmath10  @xmath2 ) in the target field while there are no density excess around the other absorbers with a lower @xmath11 . </S>"
