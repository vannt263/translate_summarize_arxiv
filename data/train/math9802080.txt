    "this is the case , for example , of the so called _ path bundle _ of a manifold ( cf .",
    "it is well known that this topological principal bundle plays the role of a universal bundle for the reconstruction of principal bundles and their connections .",
    "the path bundle is canonically endowed with a parallel transport and various important types of derivatives have been considered by several authors : the mandelstam derivative , the connection derivative and the loop derivative ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present article",
    "we shall give a unified viewpoint for all these derivatives by developing a differentiable calculus on the path bundle which is inspired on the work of chen @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we shall recall the definition of the path bundle , the loop group and the canonically defined parallel transport on the path bundle . in section 3 we shall define the notion of differentiable space and analyze its different aspects .",
    "in particular we discus what are the differentiable functions a notion that we will use to define differential operators .",
    "notions of differentiable structures on the path bundle have been considered in @xcite , but the purpose in these articles was to show that it is possible to reconstruct a principal bundle with a connection from the path bundle and the holonomy morphism .",
    "our objective here is different as it will be clear below . using the notion of differentiable function mentioned before we can attach to each point in the path bundle or the loop group a  tangent space \" simply by considering the space derivations acting on smooth functions .",
    "this will in turn allow us to define the tangent bundle and therefore vector fields as sections of it , differential forms and exterior derivatives .",
    "in section 4 we shall recall the definition of the mandelstam derivative . in section 5",
    "we shall define the _ universal connection one form_. this will be a differential one form in the sense of section 3 and we shall be able to express the connection derivative in terms of this universal connection .",
    "section 6 contains our main result .",
    "we shall prove that the loop derivative considered in @xcite is nothing but the curvature of the universal connection one form . as a consequence we obtain the bianchi identities in @xcite as the usual bianchi identities associated with the universal connection one form . finally in section 7",
    "we shall see how to represent a particular gauge theory using the results we obtained in the previous sections .",
    "finally we would like to mention that it might be possible to apply our approach to the extended group of loops studied in @xcite .",

    "in this section we define differentiable functions , tangent vectors , vector fields and differential forms for the loop group and the path bundle .",
    "we will use the multiindex notation .",
