    "the study of elliptic quantum algebras , defined with the help of elliptic @xmath4-matrices , has yielded a number of algebraic structures relevant to certain integrable systems in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics ( noticeably the @xmath5 model @xcite , rsos models @xcite and sine  gordon theory @xcite ) .",
    "more recently the definition and construction of some scaling limits has led to the notion of deformed double yangian algebras .",
    "we will investigate and develop here in great detail the occurrence of these and other limit algebraic structures and the pattern of connection in between , in the simplest case of an underlying @xmath0 algebra .",
    "two classes of elliptic solutions to the yang ",
    "baxter equation have been identified , respectively associated with the vertex statistical models @xcite and the face - type statistical models @xcite .",
    "the vertex elliptic @xmath4-matrix for @xmath0 was first used by sklyanin @xcite to construct a two - parameter deformation of the enveloping algebra @xmath6 .",
    "the central extension of this structure was proposed in @xcite for @xmath0 , and later extended to @xmath7 in @xcite .",
    "its connection to @xmath8-deformed virasoro and @xmath9 algebras @xcite was established in @xcite .",
    "the face - type @xmath4-matrices , depending on the extra parameters @xmath10 belonging to the dual of the cartan algebra in the underlying algebra , were first used by felder @xcite to define the algebra @xmath11 in the @xmath4-matrix approach .",
    "enriquez and felder @xcite and konno @xcite introduced a current representation , although differences arise in the treatment of the central extension .",
    "a slightly different structure , also based upon face - type @xmath4-matrices but incorporating extra , heisenberg algebra generators , was introduced as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this structure is relevant to the resolution of the quantum calogero  moser and ruijsenaar  schneider models @xcite .",
    "another dynamical elliptic algebra , denoted @xmath13 , was also defined and studied in @xcite .",
    "it was then interpreted , at the level of representation , as a twist of @xmath14 .",
    "particular limits of the @xmath15-type algebras were subsequently defined and compared with previously known structures .",
    "the limit @xmath16 together with the renormalization of the generators by suitable powers of @xmath17 _ before _ taking the limit , leads to the quantum algebra @xmath18 such as presented in @xcite .",
    "it differs from the presentation in @xcite by a scalar factor in the @xmath4-matrix .",
    "the scaling limit of the algebra @xmath13 was also defined in @xcite .",
    "a second limit was considered in @xcite ( @xmath4-matrix formulation ) and @xcite ( current algebra formulation ) .",
    "it is defined by taking @xmath19 ( elliptic nome ) and @xmath20 ( spectral parameter ) with @xmath21 .",
    "this algebra , denoted @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 , is relevant to the study of the @xmath26 model in its gapless regime @xcite .",
    "it admits a further limit @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) where its @xmath4-matrix becomes identical to the @xmath4-matrix defining the double yangian @xmath29 ( centrally extended ) , defined in @xcite ( yangian double ) , @xcite ( central extension ) ; alternative versions with a different normalization are given in @xcite ( for @xmath0 ) and @xcite ( for @xmath30 ) .",
    "this difference in the normalization factors of the @xmath4-matrix , crucial in confronting the centrally extended versions , is the exact counterpart of the difference between the presentation of @xmath18 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one must however be careful in this identification in terms of @xmath4-matrix structure since the generating functionals ( lax matrices ) of these algebras admit different interpretations in terms of modes ( generators of the enveloping algebra ) . in the context of @xmath31",
    "the expansion is done in terms of continuous - index fourier modes of the spectral parameter ( see @xcite ) ; in the context of @xmath29 the expansion is done in terms of powers of the spectral parameter ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown recently that both vertex algebras @xmath32 and face - type algebras @xmath33 were in fact drinfeld twists @xcite of the quantum group @xmath34 . originating with the proposition of @xcite on face - type algebras ,",
    "the construction of the twist operators was undertaken in both cases by frnsdal @xcite and finally achieved at the level of formal universal twists in @xcite . in @xcite , the universal twist is obtained by solving a linear equation introduced in @xcite , this equation playing a fundamental rle for complex continuation of @xmath35 symbols .",
    "moreover in the case of finite ( super)algebras , the convergence of the infinite products defining the twists was also proved in @xcite .",
    "this led to a formal construction of universal @xmath4-matrices for the elliptic algebras @xmath15 and @xmath36 , of which the bb and abf @xmath37 matrices are respectively ( spin @xmath38 ) evaluation representations .",
    "our strategy is to combine in as many patterns as possible the different limit procedures introduced previously in the literature ; to apply them to cases not already considered , in particular the face type algebras @xmath11 ; and thus to achieve as large as possible a self - contained network of algebraic structures extending from the elliptic quantum affine algebras to the affine lie algebra @xmath39 .    before summarizing our investigations , we must first of all define precisely the concepts which we will use throughout this paper , so that no ambiguity arises in our statements",
    ".    we shall deal with formal algebraic structures defined by @xmath4-matrix exchange relations between formal @xmath40 matrix - valued generating functionals denoted lax operators , using the well - known @xmath41 formalism @xcite .",
    "explicit @xmath4-matrices here are interpreted as evaluation representations of universal objects whenever they are known to exist , or conjectural universal objects when not .",
    "we shall not give any precise definition of the individual generators themselves , i.e. the specific expression of the individual generators in terms of spectral parameter dependent lax operators .",
    "these definitions would eventually give rise to the fully explicit algebraic structure .",
    "for instance we shall not distinguish here between the double yangian @xmath29 and the scaled algebra @xmath31 .",
    "definition of , and identification between algebraic structures will therefore be understood at the sole level of their @xmath4-matrix presentation , except in explicitly specified cases where we are able to state relations between the full ( generator - described ) exchange structures , or even the hopf or quasi - hopf algebraic structures .",
    "we consider that the existence of such relations is in any case an indication that similar connections exist at the level of universal algebras , to be explicitly formulated once the explicit algebra generators are defined .",
    "similarly we shall manipulate @xmath4-matrices at the level of their evaluation representation of spin @xmath38 ( @xmath42 matrices ) .",
    "only when we shall use the term `` universal '' , will it mean the abstract algebraic object known as universal @xmath4-matrix .",
    "the same will apply to twist operators connecting ( quasi)-hopf algebraic structures @xcite , and the @xmath4-matrices of the algebras .",
    "we recall that a twist operator @xmath43 lives in the square @xmath44 of an algebraic structure ; it connects two coproducts in @xmath45 as @xmath46 , and two universal @xmath4-matrices as @xmath47 .",
    "its evaluation representation acts similarly on the evaluation representation of the universal @xmath4-matrices : @xmath48    as in the previous case of identifications of algebras , we conjecture that occurrence of a relation of this form at the level of evaluated @xmath4-matrices is an indication that a similar relation exists at the level of universal algebras",
    ". we shall therefore denote any such relation between evaluated @xmath4-matrices as a `` twist - like action '' between two algebraic structures respectively characterized by @xmath4 and @xmath49 , even when we do not have explicit proof that a universal twist exists between the universal @xmath4-matrices , or the respective coproduct structures .",
    "a connection of the form ( [ eq : twist_intro ] ) where @xmath43 will not depend on any parameter ( spectral ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 , elliptic ( @xmath17 or @xmath52 ) or dynamical ( @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) ) will be termed `` rigid twist action '' .",
    "we must also introduce the notion of homothetical twist - like connection , whereby we mean the existence of an invertible matrix @xmath55 such that two @xmath4-matrices are connected by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a @xmath58-number function .",
    "+ at this point , we do not have an interpretation of this kind of relation between algebraic structure .",
    "we shall come back to this point in the conclusion .",

    "we now recall the following contingent properties of evaluated @xmath4-matrices .    * unitarity : @xmath66 * crossing - symmetry : @xmath67    depending upon the multiplicative or additive nature of the spectral parameter .",
    "the unitarity relation is not satisfied in most cases : the already known evaluated @xmath4-matrices for @xmath14 , @xmath11 , @xmath68 only obey the crossing relation ( [ eq : crossing ] ) @xcite .",
    "we shall meet with @xmath4-matrices obeying unitarity relations at the end of the paper , but we have no proof that they do correspond to evaluations of universal objects",
    ". we shall comment on this in the conclusion .",
    "we have indicated that universal twist operators @xmath69 transform a coproduct @xmath70 into another one @xmath71 and the @xmath72 matrix into @xmath73 .",
    "if now @xmath74 defines a quasi - triangular hopf algebra and @xmath75 satisfies the cocycle condition @xmath76 @xmath77 defines again a quasi - triangular hopf algebra .",
    "if however @xmath75 satisfies no particular cocycle - like relation , @xmath78 defines a : @xmath79 satisfies then the yb - type equation ( [ eq : quasiybe ] ) . an interesting intermediate structure arises when @xmath75 satisfies a so - called shifted cocycle condition , depending upon a parameter @xmath10 such that @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 . in this case",
    ", @xmath79 satisfies the dynamical yang  baxter equation ( [ eq : dybe ] ) .",
    "our paper is divided into two parts .",
    "we shall first of all describe the limit procedures whereby the number of parameters in the @xmath4-matrix description of the algebra ( hence including the spectral parameter ) is decreased , starting from either @xmath14 or @xmath11 ; we shall define the limit algebraic structures in both cases .",
    "these limit procedures may go in three ( for @xmath14 ) or four ( for @xmath11 ) directions :    * _ non elliptic limit : _ one sends @xmath17 to 0 ; * _ scaling limit : _ one sends @xmath8 to 1 , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the face case , where @xmath53 is related to @xmath10 , see below ) ; * _ factorization : _ one `` eliminates '' the spectral parameter by a sklyanin - type factorization . at the level of the universal algebra",
    "this corresponds to a degeneracy homomorphism ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure is only known for vertex algebras at this point .",
    "finite face type algebras however are known and shall be considered here , albeit without an established connection with the affine structures . * _ non dynamical limit : _ in the face case the dynamical parameter @xmath10 can also be eliminated by a procedure which we shall detail in the main body of the text .",
    "these limit procedures , and combinations thereof , lead to the set of objects described by figure  [ fig : rcube ] .",
    "-matrix network ]    already known structures are of course present in the diagram : @xmath11 is the face elliptic , centrally extended algebra ; @xmath14 is the vertex elliptic , centrally extended algebra ; @xmath84 and @xmath85 are two presentations @xcite of the quantum group @xmath18 @xcite connected by a conjugation and a twist - like action ; @xmath86 is the deformed double yangian algebra @xmath22 in @xcite with @xmath87 and @xmath88 ; @xmath89 is the deformed double yangian algebra defined in @xcite , connected to the previous one by a rigid twist ; @xmath29 is the double yangian defined in @xcite ; @xmath90 is the @xmath8-deformed @xmath0 algebra ; @xmath91 is sklyanin s elliptic `` degenerate '' algebra , and @xmath92 is the `` degenerate '' trigonometric algebra identified with @xmath90 by @xmath93 .    new algebraic structures also appear in this diagram , mostly due to the systematic application of the limit procedures to the face algebra @xmath11 : @xmath94 is the scaling limit of @xmath11 ; @xmath95 is its @xmath96 limit where the periodic behaviour in @xmath54 is nevertheless retained ; @xmath97 is a dynamical deformation of the double yangian ; @xmath98 and @xmath99 are dynamical deformations of @xmath18 , respectively homothetical to @xmath95 and @xmath94 by a suitable redefinition of the parameters ; @xmath100 is an `` elliptic '' non dynamical deformation of the double yangian , connected to @xmath101 by a twist - like action and homothetical to @xmath18 by the same redefinition of the parameters .",
    "finally @xmath102 and @xmath103 are dynamical deformations of the factorized structures  la sklyanin , although they themselves are not yet understood as originating from such a factorization .",
    "in addition , we also compare the structures resulting from @xmath11 and the structures derived @xcite in the analysis of @xmath104 .",
    "these structures are in in fact connected by a tla which we shall describe .    in order to avoid fastidious repetitions in the body of the text , we state immediately that _ all _ these new @xmath4-matrices have been explicitly checked to obey the yang  baxter equation ( [ eq : ybe])([eq : ybe2 ] ) or dynamical yang ",
    "baxter equation ( [ eq : dybe])([eq : dybe2 ] ) .",
    "such checks are indeed required since the computational procedures which yield these @xmath4-matrices may entail regularizations of infinite products .",
    "this fact in turn potentially invalidates a direct application of these computational procedures to the yang  baxter equation originally satisfied by the elliptic @xmath4-matrices .",
    "in the second part we describe the connections which implement the _ addition _ of supplementary parameters . to be precise :    * implementation of the elliptic nome @xmath17 ( or @xmath52 ) ; * implementation of the dynamical parameter @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) ; * implementation of the quantum parameter @xmath8 along the scaling limit connections .",

    "we have now constructed several @xmath4-matrix representations for algebraic structures , deduced from vertex or face elliptic quantum @xmath0 algebras by suitable limit procedures .",
    "we have shown that these structures exhibited associativity properties characterized by ( dynamical ) yang ",
    "baxter equations for their evaluated @xmath4-matrices .",
    "finally , we have constructed a reciprocal set of twist - like transformations , acting on the evaluated @xmath4-matrices canonically as @xmath397 .",
    "the next step is now to try to get explicit universal formulae for these @xmath4-matrices and twist operators .",
    "this in turn requires to specify the exact form under which individual generators are encapsulated in the lax matrices , and obtain thus the full description of the associative algebras which we wish to study .",
    "let us immediately indicate that we need in particular to separate ( as is explained in @xcite ) the two algebraic structures contained in the single @xmath4-matrix formulations labelled here as ( deformed ) ( dynamical ) double yangians @xmath398 .",
    "expansion of the lax matrix in terms of integer labelled generators will lead to the ( deformed ) ( dynamical ) versions of the genuine double yangian @xcite ; expansion in terms of fourier modes by a contour integral will lead to the `` scaled elliptic '' algebras @xcite more correctly labelled @xmath22 .",
    "once this is done , we can then start to investigate the following issues          universal @xmath4-matrices are known for @xmath18 @xcite ; @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite ; @xmath103 @xcite .",

    "universal twists have been constructed in the finite - algebra case from @xmath402 to @xmath403 @xcite ; and in the affine case from @xmath18 to @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that universal @xmath4-matrices and twist operators may be obtained for the complete set of algebraic structures represented by figure  [ fig : twv ] in the vertex case and figure  [ fig : twf ] in the face case .",
    "the structures @xmath398 are here to be interpreted as genuine , integer - labelled double yangians .",
    "the explicit construction of universal objects in this frame seems achievable , along the lines followed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the problem of constructing universal objects associated with the continuous - labelled algebras of @xmath404-type is more delicate , since one needs in particular to contrive a direct universal connection between continuous - labelled generators in @xmath404 and discrete - labelled generators in @xmath405 , or between @xmath406 and @xmath18 .",
    "we have described in section  [ sect : homothetical ] homothetical twist - like connections between @xmath407 , interpreted as the evaluated @xmath4-matrix @xmath223 for the centrally extended algebra @xmath39 , and unitary @xmath4-matrices realizing a @xmath41-structure `` proportional '' to @xmath18 .",
    "interpretation of this @xmath41-structure , and its derived relations at elliptic level , remains obscure .",
    "the canonical construction of universal @xmath4-matrices for @xmath18 @xcite and their subsequent evaluation @xcite leaves open the possibility of an alternative construction of universal @xmath408 evaluated @xmath4-matrix which lead to unitary ( and crossing - symmetrical ) @xmath4-matrices ; it may arise either by dropping the triangularity requirement @xmath409 , or by relaxing analyticity constraints on the evaluated @xmath4-matrix .",
    "+ homothetical tlas also appear between double yangian - like structures and their antecedent structures through the scaling procedure .",
    "the same possibilities hold for the differently normalized @xmath4-matrix structures obtained by applications of these homothetical tlas .",
    "finally let us briefly comment on the notion of `` dynamical '' algebraic structure .",
    "this notion was applied throughout this paper to algebras incorporating an extra parameter @xmath10 belonging to the cartan algebra , subsequently shifted along a general cartan algebra direction .",
    "this shift is therefore retained in the yang - baxter equation for evaluated @xmath4-matrices of face type ( but _ not _ of vertex type , for which the extra parameter is simply a @xmath58-number and the shift takes place along the central charge direction , set to zero in the evaluation representation ) .",
    "a particular illustration of this fact arises in the case of classical and quantum @xmath4-matrix for calogero ",
    "moser models @xcite where @xmath10 is identified with the momentum of the calogero  moser particles , hence the denomination `` dynamical '' for the @xmath4-matrices . in the algebraic structures described here however ,",
    "@xmath10 is not yet promoted to the rle of generator , hence this denomination is slightly abusive .",
    "there exists however at least one example of algebraic structure , @xmath410 @xcite , where @xmath10 and its conjugate @xmath411 are `` added '' to the algebra @xmath11 ; however @xmath410 is not a hopf , even quasi - hopf , algebra .",
    "we expect therefore that similar genuinely dynamical algebraic structures may be associated in the same way to all `` dynamical '' algebras described here , and may play important rle in solving the models where such algebras arise .",
