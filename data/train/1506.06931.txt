    "the important ingredient for quantum computation and information processing is the presence of coherent superpositions .",
    "a single isolated two - level system can be prepared in a coherent superposition of @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , and the manipulation of such states leads to new possibilities for storage and processing of information @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the ideal isolated case , the interactions of real quantum systems with their environment lead to the loss of these coherent superpositions , in other words , decoherence .",
    "however , the more realistic case would be manipulation of many qubits",
    ". coherent superposition of such states leads to the concept of entanglement , which forms a precious resource for quantum computation and information .",
    "the fragility of entanglement is due to the coupling between a quantum system and its environment ; such a coupling leads to decoherence , the process by which information is degraded @xcite .",
    "in fact , decoherence is one of the main obstacles for the preparation , observation , and implementation of multi - qubit entangled states .",
    "the intensive work on quantum information and computing in recent years has tremendously increased the interest in exploring and controlling decoherence effects @xcite . in this work",
    "we address the problem where each of the two qubits are dissipatively coupled to a local bosonic bath ; in quantum optical sense it would mean that both the two - level systems are subject to spontaneous emission and would imply there exist relaxation between the excited state to ground state .",
    "dissipation can assist the generation of entanglement @xcite that can be used for various quantum information processing .",
    "for example , f. verstraete _ et al _ @xcite have shown that dissipation can be used as a resource for the universal quantum computation without any coherent dynamics needed to implement it .",
    "contrary to other methods , entanglement generation by dissipation does not require the preparation of a system in a particular input state and exists , in principle , for an arbitrary long time .",
    "these features make dissipative methods inherently stable against weak random perturbations , with the dissipative dynamics stabilizing the entanglement .",
    "the effects on system due to environment can be classified into the process with memory ( non - markovian ) and without memory ( markovian ) effects @xcite . in case of markovian processes ,",
    "the environment acts as a sink for the system information ; the system of interest loses information into the environment and this lost information plays no role in the dynamics of the system .",
    "however , due to memory effects in case of non - markovian dynamics , the information lost by the system during the interaction with the environment will return back to the system at later time .",
    "this makes the non - markovian dynamics complicated .",
    "understanding the nature of non - markovian dynamics is naturally a very important topic for quantum information science , where the aim is to control a quantum system for use in technological applications @xcite . in general , three time scales in an open system",
    "exist to characterize non - markovian dynamics : ( i ) the time scale of the system ( ii ) the time scale of the bath given by the bandwidth of bath spectral density ( iii ) the mutual time scale arising from the coupling between the system and the bath .",
    "it is usually believed that non - markovian effects strongly rely on the relations among these different time scales @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive a quantum master equation for interacting qubits with local dissipation .",
    "the equation is derived utilizing the completeness of the eigen basis of the hamiltonian representing the interacting qubits .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix turns out to be the sum of the time evolution corresponding to individual qubits with no cross terms .",
    "next we solve this master equation for @xmath0-type states with the assumption that individual baths have the same properties .",
    "the main content of this paper will remain however the same as for other kind of states and assuming different bath correlation functions for each bath .",
    "the different bath correlation functions can give rise to different time scales in the dynamics and is treated separately .",
    "next we identify different regimes of dynamics ( markovian and non - markovian ) and show that under non - markovian regimes of the dynamics , there exists finite entanglement in an initially unentangled state .",
    "this entanglement decay in the same way as the pure state entanglement and we find that the decay rate of entanglement is strongly modified by the non - markovian behavior .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the model hamiltonian and derive the quantum master equation . in the past related works",
    "@xcite , non - interacting qubits have been considered .",
    "these qubits are then coupled to a common bath . however , in this paper , we consider qubits interacting through isotropic heisenberg interaction which is a general kind of interaction in condensed matter physics . in section iii , we solve the quantum master equation in the eigen - basis of the system hamiltonian for a general class of initial quantum states under the assumption that the bath correlation function decay in the same way.in section iv we give the decay of entanglement of certain @xmath0-type state .",
    "finally we conclude in section v with the remarks of wider context of our results .",
    "in this section we will first derive master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system which govern the dynamics of the system .",
    "we consider two qubits represented by spin-@xmath3 particles or two level atoms coupled to each other via isotropic heisenberg interaction .",
