    "are followed by more robust and controllable implementations @xcite .",
    "superiority of a qw algorithm @xcite is experimentally demonstrated very recently @xcite . in a latest experiment @xcite ,",
    "the effect of absorbing boundaries on the quantum walk is examined .",
    "the qw on a line segment with absorbing boundaries @xcite is a special case of a more general situation of qw in the presence of absorbing traps .    a qw on a trapped lattice exhibits transition to crw @xcite ; therefore traps can be characterized as a quantum decoherence mechanism @xcite , similar to broken links @xcite or environmental noise @xcite .",
    "controlling trap density in the lattice allows for tunable decoherence mechanism , which is beneficial for fundamental investigations of quantum decoherence and for efficient implementation and speeding up quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "in addition to their role as a source of quantum decoherence , traps can play another role on the dynamics of qw .",
    "it is known that their presence causes different dynamical regimes on the evolution of crw .",
    "our aim is to explore if such distinct dynamical regimes can emerge in qw without changing its quantum nature .",
    "earlier occurrences of such a crossover between different dynamical regimes than quantum to classical transition should be taken into account potential applications of trapped qw .",
    "trapped crw was extensively explored @xcite .",
    "a practical quantity of interest is the survival probability of diffusing particles , which is the mean probability that a walker can still be found on the lattice after some time @xmath0 .",
    "it can be analytically calculated for a one - dimensional crw @xcite .",
    "in the early times of crw on a one - dimensional lattice with low trap concentration , survival probability decays exponentially with the square root of time , @xmath1 , which is known as rosenstock ( rs ) @xcite behavior . at",
    "asymptotically large times , this behavior makes a crossover @xcite to a qualitatively different scaling form , which is called donkser and varadhan ( dv ) regime @xcite , in which the survival probability exponentially decays with @xmath2 .",
    "similar scaling forms also appear in the closely related problem of lifshitz tail or griffiths singularity of the density of states at the band edge for a quantum electron in random potential @xcite .",
    "it is neither intuitively nor quantitatively obvious to extend the classical results to characterize the survival probability of quantum walkers on a trapped land , because of the curious role of quantum coherence and path interference played in a qw which is associated with the characteristic strong de - localization of quantum walkers .",
    "this paper specifically addresses the question of quantum diffusion dynamics on a trapped chain , in particular investigates the quantum analogs of the rs and dv dynamical regimes of the classical diffusion problem .",
    "it is difficult to observe the rs - to - dv crossover in crw .",
    "time dependence of classical survival probability makes the crossover only after a long time , though it can happen relatively earlier for larger trap concentrations or for larger diffusive constants @xcite .",
    "motivated by the role of the diffusive constant in shortening the crossover time in crw , we predict that highly de - localized quantum walkers can enter the dv regime earlier than the classical walkers . furthermore , the qualitatively different dv scaling form in crw is attributed to the existence of large voids , or absorber - free regions , which are exponentially rare among the possible configurations @xcite .",
    "their contribution can dominate the time dependence of the survival probability only at large times , after the more common smaller voids lost their walkers . in qw",
    ", we expect that , due to the larger spread of the walkers , such voids should be larger , and hence more rare .",
    "an average over such clusters , with their corresponding large decay times , would lead to slower decay of quantum walkers than their classical counterparts .",
    "indeed , for a continuous time one - dimensional quantum transport problem , it is found that the survival probability exponentially decays with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this asymptotically slower decay of quantum coherent particles than the diffusive classical particles is explained by the existence of slowly - decaying asymptotically large trap - free segments @xcite .",
    "in qw - based search algorithms with multi - agents , such slowing down of quantum coherent dynamics would cause an additional limitation of the quantum speeding up even for small target ( or trap ) concentrations .",
    "it should be taken into account in addition to the usual quantum - to - classical decoherence problem .",
    "we perform detailed numerical simulations for settings relevant to current experimental efforts . as such ,",
    "our discussion is limited to the one - dimensional coined discrete - time qw .",
    "comparative studies of signatures of coherent and incoherent transport in the case of continuous - time quantum walk are recently reported @xcite .",
    "we give particular attention to the practical case of small , finite size lattices and small number of time steps .",
    "similar to the classical prototype system of disordered media , randomly distributed static traps are assumed .",
    "the trapping process is supposed to be a quenched , instantaneous and perfect absorption of walkers . in a typical scenario of interest",
    "there would be few traps , and dynamics would be limited to short times ; but the cases of long time behavior as well as densely trapped lattices are also analyzed to comprehend differences in both rs and dv regimes , in addition to dynamics of quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "we explain our numerical results by the flory - type heuristic arguments @xcite used in polymer chemistry .",
    "spatial arrangements of macromolecules , or conformations of polymers , are closely related to the diffusion and the random walk problem . in the early 1930s ,",
    "structural chemistry descriptions of long - chain molecules were based upon unconstrained random walks , where the skeletal bonds of the molecule are represented by the uncorrelated steps of random walkers .",
    "this analogy yields scaling relations for the root mean square ( rms ) distance of the chain ( squared radius of gyration ) depending on the bond length and the number of the bonds . in 1949 , p. j. florry has provided a seminal work which takes into account volume exclusion effect ( no segments of a molecule can overlap in space ) , in formation of polymers .",
    "this allows for description of polymer growth in terms of the self - avoiding or repulsive random walks . in self - avoiding walks ,",
    "the walker would stop or become trapped if there are no more unvisited neighboring sites .",
    "our trapped lattice model is in that sense is closely related to such random walk models of polymer growth and size distribution .",
    "the movement of a single walker to a nearest neighbor site can be imagined as initiating formation of an unsaturated bifunctional monomer , while trapping would give polymers of different sizes .",

    "we consider a coined discrete - time qw on a finite linear lattice segment with periodic boundary conditions . denoting the total number of sites on the lattice by @xmath4 ,",
