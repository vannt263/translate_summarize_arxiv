    "recently , the zeus and h1 experiments at hera have reported the first evidence for diffractive deeply inelastic electron scattering @xcite , @xmath0 this is an example of a more general phenomenon , diffractive hard scattering , in which a high energy incident hadron participates in a hard interaction , involving very large momentum transfers , but nevertheless the hadron itself is diffractively scattered , emerging with a small transverse momentum and the loss of a rather small fraction of its longitudinal momentum .",

    "the original paper of ingelman and schlein did not mention the function ( [ fdiff ] ) but instead introduced a related function , the `` distribution of partons in the pomeron . ''",

    "the reader may wonder why we concentrate on the theoretical diffractive parton distributions rather than on the physical quantity @xmath58 .",
    "the reasons are the same as in ordinary hard scattering : 1 ) the diffractive parton distributions are process independent and 2 ) the factorization ( [ factor ] ) allows one to include perturbative corrections to the hard scattering .",

    "these operator products are ultraviolet divergent , and are renormalized at scale @xmath10 using the @xmath77 prescription , as described in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for these definitions is that in qcd canonically quantized on null surfaces @xmath78 using @xmath79 gauge , the operators measure the probability to find a quark and gluon respectively carrying plus component of momentum equal to @xmath80 .",

    ". then @xmath77 renormalization removes divergences .",
    "the line integrals of the color potential have a physical interpretation . whenever a parton is measured by a short distance probe , the color carried by that parton has to go somewhere .",
    "for instance , in deeply inelastic scattering , the color is carried away by the recoiling struck quark . in the definition of the parton distribution function ,",
    "the recoil color flow is idealized as an infinitely narrow jet moving with the speed of light along the path @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",

    "this introduces a renormalization scale @xmath10 into the functions . in applications ,",
    "one sets @xmath10 to be the same order of magnitude as the hard scale of the physical process .",

    "in sec .  [ diffdis ] , we presented the hypothesis of diffractive factorization for diffractive deeply inelastic scattering , as represented by eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) : @xmath96 this is an example of the more general hypothesis of factorization for other kinds of diffractive hard scattering .",

    "this general diffractive factorization hypothesis was put forward by veneziano and trentadue in their paper @xcite on fracture functions . the ingelman - schlein model @xcite demands diffractive factorization plus the regge structure of the diffractive parton distributions .",
    "thus , in a strict interpretation , the validity of the ingelman - schlein model logically implies the validity of diffractive factorization . on the other hand , one might interpret the ingelman - schlein model as being valid if corrections to it , while not vanishing in the limit of large @xmath114 , were nevertheless _ numerically _ small .",
    "thus , for instance , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite speculated that the factorization inherent in the ingelman - schlein model was not likely to be exact up to @xmath111 corrections but might have the same status as regge factorization , which has proven to be a useful approximation even if it is not exact .",
    "the hypothesis of diffractive factorization appears to us to be correct in the case of deeply inelastic scattering .",
    "a detailed proof of this statement is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we can briefly sketch how such a proof would go , following the ideas of refs .",
    "the singularities of the cut feynman graphs for diffractive deeply inelastic scattering are such that the leading integration regions involve 1 ) a beam jet in the direction of the initial hadron @xmath2 ( which includes the final state diffracted hadron @xmath24 ) , 2 ) a hard interaction , 3 ) one or more final state jets that are _ not _ in the direction of hadron @xmath2 , and 4 ) possible soft gluons ( sometimes with soft quark loops ) that may communicate between the beam jet and the final state jets .",
    "factorization would be more or less kinematic were it not for the possibility of the soft gluons linking the beam jet with the final state jets .",
    "one must use gauge invariance to show that the soft gluons do nt really `` see '' the details of the final state jets , so that the connections to the final state jets can be replaced by connections to the idealized jet that is embodied in the line integral of the field operator @xmath115 in the definitions of the diffractive parton distribution functions , eqs .",

    "the proof of _ ordinary _ factorization is much more delicate .",
    "the problem is that low momentum gluons can communicate between the partons of the two beam jets .",
    "this can happen even before the hard scattering takes place , as in fig .",
    "[ diffjetbad ] .",
    "when one looks for the hard process inclusively , such effects cancel @xcite .",
    "but the cancellation requires a sum over final states .",
    "collins , frankfurt , and strikman @xcite have argued that the demand that the final state include a diffractively scattered hadron destroys the factorization . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we looked at this problem in the context of a simple perturbative model .",
    "we found that the diffractive factorization hypothesis is , indeed , not valid .",
    "new terms proportional to @xmath118 appear in eq .",

    "the simplest version of this expectation is that @xmath125 is the same as in soft pomeron physics , @xmath128 @xcite .",

    "the hera results @xcite , together with the earlier ua8 results @xcite , have confirmed the basic features of the ingelman - schlein picture of diffractive deeply inelastic scattering .",
    "the experiments have shown that diffractive scattering is related to exchanges of quanta that , when examined with a hard probe , appear to be the pointlike quarks and gluons of qcd .",
    "much more remains to be done , but already we are challenged to connect the theory of pointlike gluons to the soft color dynamics that is presumably responsible for diffractive scattering .",
    "we thank g.  j.  van oldenborgh for explicitly rechecking his algorithms in some of the sensitive low @xmath7 regions investigated in appendix [ appendix : model ] .",
    "we thank j.  c.  collins , g.  ingelman , j.  bartels and many members of the h1 and zeus collaborations for helpful conversations .",
    "in this appendix we investigate the structure of the hard subgraph for the diffractive distribution of gluons in hadron in the limit @xmath388 . recall that the hard subgraph is a function of momenta @xmath389 , and @xmath17 , where @xmath190 and @xmath191 are the momenta of the gluons exchanged with the soft subgraph and @xmath17",
    "is the momentum of the gluon that goes into the final state . since @xmath390 we will consider the hard subgraph to be a function of @xmath181 and @xmath188 , replacing @xmath391 by @xmath392 . the momentum of the detected gluon is @xmath393 .    in sec .",
    "[ tauquark ] , we studied the hard subgraph in the limit that applies when @xmath388 .",
    "this limit is really a dual limit .",
    "we take @xmath394 but @xmath395 we also recall the definition ( [ calr ] ) of the integration region considered for @xmath181 , @xmath396 that is , @xmath397 . we combine this with the assumption that , in the effective integration region for @xmath201 , @xmath208 , @xmath203 and @xmath207 , these variables have values typical for slow gluons : @xmath398 then @xmath399 we claimed in sec .",
    "[ decompose ] that in this limit , the hard subgraph is independent of the variables @xmath201 , @xmath208 , @xmath203 , and @xmath207 .",
    "we also claimed that the transverse components of the hard subgraph dominate over other components in the limit considered , as in eq .",
    "( [ hardsoftindices ] ) . in this appendix , we substantiate these claims .",
    "we consider first the question of the independence on the variables @xmath201 , @xmath208 , @xmath203 , and @xmath207 , taking , for the moment , only the transverse components of the hard scattering subgraph .",
    "this is the same as multiplying the hard subgraph by purely transverse polarization vectors for the two gluons exchanged with the soft subgraph .",
    "we consider the hard amplitude @xmath222 , defined as in sec .",
    "thus @xmath222 does not include the propagator for the detected gluon with momentum @xmath189 , but does include an @xmath230 gauge polarization vector for this gluon .",
    "it also includes an @xmath400 gauge polarization vector for the gluon with momentum @xmath17 that enters the final state .    as a matter of convenience",
    ", we will analyze the first graph in fig .",
    "[ hardfig ] .",
    "essentially the same argument covers the second graph , while the third graph , with a four gluon interaction , is quite trivial .",
    "the feynman rules give @xmath222 as a rational function of the components of @xmath389 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we are interested in particular in the behavior of @xmath222 for small values of @xmath203 , @xmath207 , @xmath201 , @xmath208 and @xmath181 as specified in eqs .",
    "( [ limitqplus ] ) and ( [ limitqminus ] ) . for this reason ,",
    "we need to know if there are any factors of the small variables in the denominator of @xmath222 .",
    "the gluon propagator in fig .",
    "[ hardfig ] is @xmath401 } % \\ ] ] setting @xmath402 , the denominator becomes @xmath403 then using eqs .",
    "( [ limitqplus ] ) and ( [ limitqminus ] ) ( in either order ) , the denominator becomes @xmath404 that is , the denominator does not contain factors of the small variables , so that it has a finite limit as the small variables tend to zero",
    ".    we can write @xmath222 as a product @xmath405 the transverse components of the polarization vectors have the form @xmath406 for @xmath407 stands for any of the momenta @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath17 or @xmath189 . for @xmath408 or @xmath191 we are ( temporarily ) defining @xmath409 .",
    "the polarization vector for the detected gluon has @xmath410 but has a non - zero minus component @xmath411 the polarization vector for the final - state gluon , which we take to be in @xmath400 gauge according to eq .",
    "( [ aminusgauge ] ) , has a non - zero plus component @xmath412 thus neither the gluon propagator nor any of the polarization vectors contains a factor of a small variable in the denominator .",
    "we now consider the transverse tensor @xmath413 as a function of the variables @xmath414 @xmath415 is a rational function of these arguments and has dimension @xmath416 and boost dimension @xmath417 , where @xmath97 gives the scaling under boosts in the @xmath418 direction .",
    "that is , for any four - vector @xmath407 , @xmath419 since @xmath415 has @xmath420 and @xmath416 , it can be written as a function of a reduced number of arguments , each of which has @xmath421 : @xmath422 we are interested in the limit in which the last five arguments are small , and we know that none of these arguments occur as factors in the denominators .",
    "thus when eqs .",
    "( [ limitqplus ] ) and ( [ limitqminus ] ) hold , @xmath415 approaches the limiting value @xmath423 we thus confirm the claim made in sec .  [ decompose ] that we can neglect @xmath201 , @xmath208 , @xmath203 , and @xmath207 in @xmath222 .",
    "furthermore , since the limiting function is covariant under rotations about the @xmath418 axis , it must be a linear combination of the tensors @xmath424 , @xmath425 and @xmath426 .",
    "each of these tensors multiplies a rational function of @xmath427 .",
    "that is , the coefficient functions are rational functions of @xmath194 .",
    "this is , of course , just the structure given in eq .",
    "( [ calmresult ] ) .",
    "the argument given above does not establish that the limiting function is nonzero , but this is what we found by calculation .",
    "we now return to the issue of whether the transverse components of the hard subgraph dominate over other components , as claimed in sec .",
    "[ decompose ] .",
    "we consider @xmath428 and choose values other than @xmath429 for @xmath384 or @xmath12 or both .",
    "now @xmath430 or @xmath431 are not possible : @xmath432 multiplies the soft subgraph with corresponding indices , call it @xmath433 , which vanishes for @xmath430 or @xmath431 because of the gauge condition @xmath434 ( that is , @xmath435 ) .",
    "thus we should consider @xmath436 or @xmath437 .",
    "let us consider @xmath436 with @xmath438 as an example that illustrates the general argument .",
    "thus we wish to investigate whether @xmath439 is dominated by @xmath440 in the limit specified by eqs .",
    "( [ limitqplus ] ) and ( [ limitqminus ] ) .",
    "we need an order of magnitude estimate for the ratio of @xmath441 to @xmath442 .",
    "an analysis of lowest order graphs indicates that this is the same as the ratio of the corresponding components of the polarization vectors for a typical slow gluon , @xmath443 .",
    "we write this as @xmath444 and compare @xmath445 to @xmath446 .",
    "the analysis is simple .",
    "@xmath447 has dimension @xmath416 and boost dimension @xmath448 .",
    "thus it can be written as @xmath449 times a function @xmath450 that has dimension @xmath416 and boost dimension @xmath451 and , like @xmath452 , has no factors of the small variables in its denominator .",
    "as our previous analysis shows , @xmath450 has a finite limit as the the small variables tend to zero .",
    "( actually , @xmath450 vanishes in this limit because of its spin structure , but we will not need to use this fact . ) we note that the factor that multiplies @xmath450 @xmath453 vanishes in the limit specified by eq .",
    "( [ limitqminus ] ) .",
    "this establishes the claim .",
    "in this appendix we compute the diffractive gluon distribution @xmath454 in a simple model . as we will see , this model does not exhibit the pomeron behavior @xmath455 with @xmath456 .",
    "nevertheless , the model provides a check that @xmath457 can have a finite limit as @xmath458 in an exact numerical evaluation of the graphs to a given order of perturbation theory .",
    "the model we will use is scalar - quark qcd , given by the lagrangian , @xmath459 this model has soft and collinear singularities just as in qcd .",
    "as one further simplification , we model the diffractively scattered particle by the scalar @xmath460 field with a @xmath461 interaction to the quarks . then the perturbative @xmath462 interaction plays the role of the nonperturbative bethe - salpeter wave function of a real qcd meson . the probability for finding a @xmath463-pair inside the meson in this model falls of as @xmath464 in the ultraviolet , where @xmath465 is the transverse momentum of the quark .",
    "this good behavior in the ultraviolet is due to the fact that g carries the dimension of mass .",
    "thus the model allows for a simple treatment that approximately simulates properties of bound quarks inside a hadron .    using this model , we compute the diffractive gluon distribution function within a meson , @xmath466 , as given in eq .",
    "( [ fdifftog ] ) , to the lowest nontrivial order in @xmath467 , order @xmath468 .",
    "one of the order @xmath468 diagrams for the function @xmath469 in eq .",
    "( [ fdifftog ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmod ] .",
    "one gluon is detected , and a single gluon is exchanged between the two quark loops on opposite sides of the final state cut .",
    "this gluon carries that portion of the momentum transfer from the meson that is lost to the detected gluon ( and in a physical process would be lost to the hard interaction ) .",
    "the heavy bar ending with gluon lines represents the gluon density operator in eq .",
    "( [ fdiff1 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the graph shown , at each loop the gluons can also attach to the lower quark line . also in both cases there is a graph where the gluon lines are crossed .",
    "in addition one gluon can attach on each of the quark lines .",
    "finally there are the two - gluon two - quark contact interaction graphs . in total",

    "we have evaluated the loop integrals in eq .",
    "( [ pertdist ] ) in terms of their explicit spence function expressions . for this",
    "we have used the computer code of g.  j.  van oldenborgh and j.  a.  m.vermaseren @xcite .",

    "it was for small @xmath7 , one external line was massless , and one had to integrate over a large region in the transverse space of the variable @xmath181 . due to gauge invariance , several constraints are placed on @xmath476 which we have numerically checked to hold .",
