    "the interactions between atoms and surfaces are important in many areas of physics .",

    "i will focus primarily on the long - range atom - surface interactions relevant to the atomic , molecular , and optical physics of cold atoms near surfaces .",
    "i will introduce the short - range lennard - jones potential and the long - range retarded casimir - polder potential , discuss the accurate calculation of the interaction coefficients and the calculation of the potentials for distances that are not too close to the surfaces , and the inclusion of real surface properties , such as dielectric response and temperature .",

    "the interaction between polarizable systems is mediated by the exchange of virtual photons and as the separation of the systems increases there is a characteristic change in the interaction energy between them . in 1948 ,",
    "casimir and polder showed with quantum electrodynamics that for an atom interacting with a perfectly conducting wall the potential is  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the static electric dipole polarizability of the atom .",

    "the appearance of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the weaker interaction ( higher inverse power of @xmath1 ) are signatures of the casimir - polder potential . to understand the interaction potential  ( [ cp ] ) it is convenient to begin with a simple derivation of the retarded potential between two finite , polarizable systems that gives the correct expressions up to numerical constants .",
