    "a particular perturbative approach is the so - called hard scattering formalism  @xcite , where the transition amplitude of a process is written in factorized form as the convolution of a hard scattering amplitude , specifying a partonic subprocess at large scale , and a universal , i.e. , process independent , hadronic distribution amplitude . while the hard scattering amplitude is perturbatively calculable",
    ", distribution amplitudes describe the soft transition from partons to hadrons and thus can not be calculated from first principles as yet .",
    "therefore , in order to make reliable predictions for exclusive reactions , it is crucial to obtain information about the shape of distribution amplitudes from other sources .",

    "the gegenbauer coefficients contain non - perturbative information and are largely unknown .",
    "the topic of this talk is an investigation of the photon - to - meson transition form factor for virtual photons . in particular , we address the question whether we can obtain additional information on the gegenbauer coefficients @xmath14 of @xmath6 from the measurement of the form factor at current and planned @xmath0 colliders .",

    "it is interesting to note that the dominant effects come from @xmath72-corrections to the hard scattering amplitude ; the sudakov corrections amount to less than about 1.5% in the kinematics considered here .",
    "we see that the transverse momentum corrections rapidly decrease as one goes away from @xmath73 .",
