    "in any search , the presence of standard model background will degrade the sensitivity of the analysis because it is impossible to unambiguously seperate events originating from the signal process from the expected background events .",
    "although it is possible , when setting a limit on a signal hypothesis , to assume that all observed events come from the signal , a search analyzed in this way will only be able to exclude signals which are significantly larger than the background expectation of the analysis .",
    "background subtraction is a method of incorporating knowledge of the background expectation into the interpretation of search results in order to reduce the impact of standard model processes on the sensitivity of the search .",
    "the end result of an unsuccessful search is an exclusion confidence for a given signal hypothesis based on the experimental observation .",
    "this confidence level @xmath1 is associated with a signal and background expectation and an observation , and is required to be conservative .",
    "a conservative confidence level is one in which the false exclusion rate , or probability that an experiment with signal will be excluded , must be less than or equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is called the confidence coefficient .",
    "the classical frequentist confidence level is defined such that this probability is equal to @xmath2 . in the presence of a sufficiently large downward fluctuation in the background observation ,",
    "however , the classical confidence level can exclude arbitrarily small signals .",
    "specifically , for sufficiently large background expectations , it is possible for an observation to exclude the background hypothesis , in which case , the classical confidence level will also exclude a signal to which the search is completely insensitive . in order to prevent this kind of exclusion , and because there is no ambiguity when zero events are observed , it is required that all methods must default to a confidence level @xmath3 in order to be `` deontologically correct . ''",
    "when no events are observed , one should not perform any background subtraction , and @xmath2 , the probability of observing zero signal events should be just @xmath0 .",
    "further , any observation of one or more candidate events should yield a larger value of @xmath2 .",
    "this correctness requirement can be easily verified for any method , and any method which is not deontologically correct should be considered too optimistic .",
    "a common method of background subtraction@xcite , based on computing a bayesian upper limit on the size of an observed signal given a flat prior distribution , calculates the confidence level @xmath1 in terms of the probabilities that a random repetition of the experiment with the same expectations would yield a lower number of candidates than the current observation , which observes @xmath4 .",
    "this method computes the background subtracted confidence to be @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the probability that an experiment with signal expectation @xmath7 and background expectation @xmath8 yields an equal or lower number of candidates than the current observation , and @xmath9 is the probability that an experiment with background expectation @xmath8 yields an equal or lower number of candidates than the current observation .",
    "when @xmath10 is zero , this method reduces to @xmath0 , demonstrating that it is deontologically correct .",
    "further , the probability of observing @xmath4 events or fewer is equal to @xmath6 , and the confidence coefficient for that observation is strictly larger than the probability of observing the result , so this method is conservative .    the method can be extended@xcite to incorporate discriminating variables such as the reconstructed mass or neural network output values by constructing a test - statistic @xmath11 for the experiment which is some function of those discriminating variables , and constructing the confidence level as the ratio of probabilities @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability that an independent experiment with signal expectation @xmath7 , background expectation @xmath8 , and some given distributions of discriminating variables yields a value of @xmath11 less than or equal to @xmath14 seen in the current experiment , and @xmath15 is the probability that an independent experiment with background expectation @xmath8 and some given distributions of discriminating variables yields a value of @xmath11 less than @xmath14 seen in the current experiment . if the test - statistic is the number of observed events , this method reduces to the method described above , though the test - statistic can be constructed as a likelihood ratio or in some other appropriate way such that larger values of @xmath11 are more consistent with the observation of a signal than lower values .",
    "for an observation of zero events the probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath15 are simply the poisson probabilities of observing zero events in the two cases . because a correctly defined test - statistic has its smallest value when and only when there are no events observed , the confidence level for the generalized version of this method then reduces to the same value as the number counting method when there are no events observed , and it is deontologically correct .",
    "similarly , the probability of observing a more signal - like test - statistic value is equal to @xmath13 , and as @xmath16 , @xmath2 is always greater than or equal to this value , so the method is conservative .",
    "though the bayesian method described in section  2 satisfies the criteria set out in section  1 , it is not the only background subtraction method which is both conservative and deontologically correct .",
    "the signal estimator method satisfies both of these criteria using @xmath13 and a boundary condition to calculate the confidence level .",
    "the boundary condition imposes the correctness requirement on the confidence level , while also making the result conservative .",
    "we wish to determine if a given signal hypothesis @xmath7 is excluded .",
    "if we could know the observed test - statistic based on events truly from signal only , which we refer to as the signal estimator @xmath17 , the confidence level would be rigorously defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the probability that an experiment with signal expectation @xmath7 yields a value of the signal estimator less than or equal to @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not directly know @xmath17 from an experiment as it is not possible to unambiguously determine if an event comes from signal or background . we can",
    "only directly know a test - statistic value based on the total observation @xmath20 although it is not possible to know @xmath17 directly , it is still possible to produce an estimate of it , with which we can calculate eq .",
    "this is most straightforward for test - statistics of the form @xmath21 where ` @xmath22 ' represents a sum or product .",
    "for example , in simple event counting , @xmath23 in this case , we can use a monte carlo simulation of the background expectation to remove the background contribution in the observed test - statistic @xmath24 , i.e. , to estimate @xmath17 , and to calculate eq .",
    "3 . in each monte carlo experiment ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath17 is defined as @xmath25 where ` @xmath26 ' represents difference or division , and @xmath27 is the minimum possible value of the signal estimator , which corresponds to the physical boundary ( zero signal events ) .",
    "the confidence level can be computed with monte carlo methods in the following way for an observed test - statistic @xmath14 .",
    "first , generate a set a monte carlo experiments with test - statistic values distributed as for experiments with the expected background but no signal to determine a distribution of possible signal estimator values for the observation according to eq .",
    "next , using a sample of monte carlo with test - statistics distributed as for experiments with signal only , and for each possible signal estimator value , calculate @xmath28).\\ ] ] the value of @xmath29 averaged over all of the signal estimator values determined with background monte carlo forms an estimate of @xmath30 , or @xmath31    the monte carlo procedure described above is very slow , and without generalization , it can only be used for the class of test - statistics which satisfy eq .",
    "the method can be generalized into a much simpler mathematical format which can be used for any kind of test - statistic .",
    "the generalization can best be illustrated with an example . in the case of simple event counting",
    ", the boundary condition for the signal estimator can be understood intuitively . for an observation of @xmath10 events ,",
    "the confidence level is computed by allowing the background to vary freely , and according to eq .",
    "8 , the signal estimator will be    @xmath32    using eq .",
    "10 , one can easily compute the confidence coefficient to be    @xmath33 \\\\           & +    \\mathcal{p}(n_{b}\\ge n_{obs } ) \\times \\mathcal{p}(n_{s } \\leq 0 )   \\\\           & =    \\mathcal{p}(n_{s+b } \\leq n_{obs } ) +              [ 1-\\mathcal{p}(n_{b}\\leq n_{obs } ) ] \\times e^{-s}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    this probability reduces to @xmath34 when one observes no candidates , so it is deontologically correct , and because the confidence level is always strictly greater than @xmath6 , it is conservative .    in order to compare the performances of this method with the bayesian method , the confidence levels for a simple experiment are analyzed in fig .  1 .",
    "for this example , the analysis is assumed to expect three events from a possible signal , and three events from standard model background processes .",
    "for both methods , when zero events are observed , the confidence level reduces to @xmath0 while for observations of more events , the signal estimator method yields a lower confidence coefficient , and thus a better exclusion confidence level . for large numbers of events , @xmath35 approaches one , meaning that both methods approach the classical confidence level and give very similar results .",
    "this method can then be generalized , as the method described in section  2 was generalized , to include discriminating variables .",
    "the natural generalization takes the form    @xmath36\\times e^{-s}.\\ ] ]    for an observation of zero events , the generalized method continues to give a confidence level @xmath0 , and the confidence level computed with this method is always conservative , with @xmath2 strictly greater than @xmath13 .",
    "generating monte carlo experiments based on a simplified higgs analysis , one can compare the performances of the generalized bayesian method described in section  2 and the signal estimator method .",
    "for the comparison it is assumed that there are three events expected from background processes , with mass distributed uniformly between 70 and 90 gev/@xmath37 , and that the signal process would yield three events , with mass distributed according to a single gaussian whose width is 2.5 gev/@xmath37 centered at 80 gev/@xmath37 . using the test - statistic described in ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .  [ comp ] shows the relative improvement in confidence level for this experiment .",
    "the signal estimator method is seen to never a worse confidence level than the generalized bayesian method .",
    "for an observation of zero candidates , and for very signal - like observations ( as @xmath15 approaches one ) the methods converge . in the region in between these extremes , the signal estimator method gives confidence levels up to 20% better than the generalized bayesian method while remaining conservative .",
    "more than one method of calculating background subtraction confidence levels which is conservative and deontologically correct exist .",
    "the signal estimator method proposed here yields less conservative limits than the bayesian method , which should result in an increase in search senstitivity , giving better limits in unsuccessful searches ."
