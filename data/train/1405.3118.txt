    "the speeds of hereditary properties and their asymptotic structure have been extensively studied , originally in the special case of a single forbidden subgraph @xcite , and more recently in general @xcite .",
    "these studies showed , in particular , that there is a certain relationship between the speed of a property  @xmath2 and the structure of graphs in  @xmath2 , and that the rates of the speed growth constitute discrete layers .",
    "the first four lower layers have been distinguished in  @xcite : these are constant , polynomial , exponential , and factorial layers . in other words ,",
    "the authors of  @xcite showed that some classes of functions do not appear as the speed of any hereditary property , and that there are discrete jumps , for example , from polynomial to exponential speeds .",
    "independently , similar results were obtained by alekseev in  @xcite . moreover",
    ", alekseev provided the first four layers with the description of all minimal classes , that is , he identified in each layer the family of all classes every proper hereditary subclass of which belongs to a lower layer ( see also  @xcite for some more involved results ) . in each of the first four lower layers",
    "the set of minimal classes is finite and each of them is defined by finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs .",
    "this provides an efficient way of determining whether a property  @xmath2 belongs to one of the first three layers .",
    "one more jump in the speed of hereditary properties was identified in  @xcite and it separates   within the factorial layer   the properties with speeds strictly below the bell number  @xmath0 from those whose speed is at least  @xmath0 . with a slight abuse of terminology we will refer to these two families of graph properties as properties below and above the bell number , respectively .",
    "the importance of this jump is due to the fact that all the properties below the bell number are well - structured . in particular , all of them have bounded clique - width  @xcite and all of them are well - quasi - ordered by the induced subgraph relation  @xcite . from the results in",
    "@xcite it follows that every hereditary property below the bell number can be characterised by finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs and hence the membership problem for each of them can be decided in polynomial time .",
    "even so , very little is known about the boundary separating the two families , that is , very little is known about the _",
    "minimal _ classes above the bell number .",
    "paper  @xcite distinguishes two cases in the study of this question : the case where a certain parameter associated with each class of graphs is finite and the case where this parameter is infinite . in the present paper",
    ", we call this parameter _ distinguishing number_. for the case where the distinguishing number is infinite , @xcite  provides a complete description of minimal classes , of which there are precisely  13 . for the case where the distinguishing number is finite ,",
    "@xcite  mentions only one minimal class above the bell number ( linear forests ) and leaves the question of characterising other minimal classes open .    in the present paper",
    ", we give a complete answer to the above open question : we provide a structural characterisation of all minimal classes above the bell number with a finite distinguishing number .",
    "this family of minimal classes is infinite , which makes the problem of deciding whether a hereditary class is above or below the bell number questionable . nevertheless , for properties defined by _",
    "finitely many _ forbidden induced subgraphs , our characterisation allows us to prove decidability of this problem : we show that there exists an algorithm which , given a finite set  @xmath1 of graphs , decides whether the class @xmath5 is above or below the bell number .",
    "all preliminary information related to the topic of the paper can be found in section  [ sec : prelim ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "structure ] , we describe the minimal classes above the bell number . finally , in section  [ sec : decid ] we present our decidability result . section  [ sec : con ] concludes the paper with an open problem .",
    "all graphs we consider are undirected without multiple edges .",
    "the graphs in our hereditary classes have no loops ; however , we allow loops in some auxiliary graphs , called `` density graphs '' and denoted usually by  @xmath7 , that are used to represent the global structure of our hereditary classes",
