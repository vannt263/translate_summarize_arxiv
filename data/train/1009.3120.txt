    "in the past two decades , microcavity polaritons  @xcite have attracted considerable interest because of the possibility of strongly coupling light and matter , leading to an easy manipulation and detection of the non - linear properties of matter via light  see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , in light of their out - of - equilibrium nature , there has been a growing interest in studying polariton superfluid properties  @xcite .",
    "in fact , polaritons have very short lifetimes ( around @xmath0  ps even in the best available samples  @xcite ) , therefore any polariton fluid is the result of a steady state balance between pumping and decay .",
    "the effects of pump and decay in polariton systems are the subject of several recent theoretical and experimental work .    for condensates in local thermal equilibrium , such as superfluid @xmath1he and the ultracold atom bose - einstein condensates , the concept of superfluidity is strongly linked to several paradigmatical properties , such as the landau criterion , quantised circulation of velocity , and metastable persistent flow . in particular",
    ", the landau criterion connects the frictionless motion of a defect at velocities smaller than a critical one , with the shape of the spectrum of elementary excitations  @xcite . for weakly interacting bose gases and a microscopic weak defect , such that a perturbative linear response theory can be applied , the phonon - like dispersion of the bogoliubov spectrum demands that the critical velocity for dissipationless flow coincides with the velocity of sound  @xcite .",
    "however , for macroscopic defects , the critical velocity for the onset of drag is smaller than the speed of sound and most likely related to vortex nucleation  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the relevance of the landau criterion for out - of - equilibrium condensates is questionable , not least because the spectrum of excitations is now complex rather than real . for polariton fluids",
    ", one has to singularly assess the system properties in the three different pumping schemes available : i ) non - resonant pumping ; ii ) parametric drive in the optical - parametric - oscillator ( opo ) regime ; iii ) coherent drive in the pump - only configuration .",
    "as far as the spectrum of quasi - particle excitations and the landau criterion are concerned , the cases of non - resonantly pumped polaritons  @xcite and parametrically driven polaritons in the opo regime  @xcite are similar : in both cases , there is a @xmath2 phase symmetry which is spontaneously broken above a pump power threshold .",
    "this leads to the appearance of a gapless ( goldstone ) mode in the spectrum of excitations  gapless means that both real and imaginary part of the excitation energy go to zero at zero momentum .",
    "however , in both cases , the effects of pump and decay are such that the real part of the goldstone mode energy is zero also in a finite interval at small momenta , i.e. the spectrum becomes diffusive  @xcite .",
    "this means that a strict application of the landau criterion would lead to a zero critical velocity , where quasi - particles can be excited at any value of the fluid speed . therefore , if one would define superfluid properties through a strict application of the landau criterion , neither non - resonantly pumped polaritons nor parametrically driven polaritons in the opo regime behave as superfluids .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases there have been evidences for superfluid behaviour . for",
    "non - resonantly pumped polaritons , it has been recently shown  @xcite that , even though strictly speaking there can not be superfluid behaviour , there are regimes close to equilibrium , where the drag force exerted on a small moving defect shows a sharp threshold at velocities close to the speed of sound .",
    "otherwise , for shorter polariton lifetimes , the threshold - like behaviour of the drag force is replaced by a smooth crossover .",
    "moreover , metastability of supercurrents in non - resonantly pumped microcavities has been theoretically demonstrated  @xcite . for polaritons in the opo regime",
    ", superfluidity has instead been tested through frictionless flow of polariton bullets  @xcite , through metastability of quantum vortices and persistence of currents  @xcite .",
    "the case of coherently driven polaritons in the pump - only configuration strongly differs from the two schemes previously described : here , there is no phase freedom any longer , because the polariton phase locks to the one of the driving pump . as a consequence",
    ", the quasi - particle excitation spectrum is always gapped  i.e. , even when the real part of the spectrum energy goes to zero at the pump momentum , the corresponding imaginary part is non zero .",
    "for coherently driven polaritons in the pump - only configuration , by making use of a linearised bogoliubov - like theory , it has been predicted that the landau criterion can instead be satisfied at either strong enough pump powers or small flow velocities  @xcite , regimes where polaritons display a dramatic reduction in the intensity of resonant rayleigh scattering . for values of the parameters",
    "where instead the spectrum allows the excitation of quasi - particles , cherenkov - like waves were predicted  @xcite , and recently observed in the density profile  @xcite .",
    "consequently , experiments in this configuration have been analysed in terms of the same theoretical description which is valid for equilibrium superfluids .    in this work ,",
    "we show that , despite the fact coherently driven polaritons in the pump - only configuration do satisfy the landau criterion at large enough densities or small flow velocities , because of the polariton lifetime being finite , the fluid always experiences a residual drag force even in the limit of asymptotically large densities .",
    "we show that , only in the limit of perfect microcavities ( i.e. infinitely long polariton lifetimes ) , the residual drag force at large enough densities goes to zero , recovering therefore the equilibrium limit . otherwise , for finite polariton lifetimes close to the current experimental values , we find that , similarly to the case of incoherently driven polaritons , both the drag force exerted on the polariton fluid by a defect , as well as the height of cherenkov radiation , and the percentage of particles scattered by the defect show a smooth crossover rather than a sharp threshold - like behaviour which is typical of superfluids which obey the landau criterion .",

    "cherenkov radiation is generated in the supersonic regime , when the fluid is passing a defect at a velocity higher than the phase velocity of the fluid elementary excitations .",
    "as mentioned later , a simple analysis of cherenkov radiation can be carried on by making use of perturbative bogoliubov - like analysis : here , in agreement with the landau criterion , in the supersonic regime , the kinetic energy of the fluid can be dissipated radiating bogoliubov modes , giving rise to perturbations which propagate radially from the defect , with a characteristic unperturbed region inside a cherenkov cone which is related to the singularity of the bogoliubov mode dispersion evaluated in the reference frame of the moving fluid  @xcite . in our numerical non - perturbative analysis",

    "the spectrum of the quasi - particle excitations can be found by introducing particle - like @xmath80 and hole - like @xmath81 excitations in both the exciton and photon fluctuation fields : @xmath82 and by solving the eigenvalue equation : @xmath83 \\begin{pmatrix } u_{x;{{\\mathbf k } } } & u_{c;{{\\mathbf k } } }      & v_{x;{{\\mathbf k } } } & v_{c;{{\\mathbf k}}}\\end{pmatrix}^t = 0 \\ ; , \\label{eq : spect}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is a @xmath85 matrix given by :    @xmath86    eq .   admits four complex eigenvalues for each @xmath87 which we indicate as @xmath88 .",
    "note that the spectrum obtained this way is already evaluated in the polariton flow moving frame .",
    "this becomes evident in the limit where the pump momentum @xmath36 is small enough so that the lp dispersion can be approximated as parabolic , and the up dispersion can be neglected .",

    "the two main results to be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : dragf ] are the existence of a cross - over instead of an abrupt transition and the appearance of the residual drag force .",
    "since these results have been obtained with a practically infinite barrier ( @xmath42  mev ) , one can wonder to what extend they remain valid for actual potential barriers which are much lower .",

    "the origin of the residual drag force for asymptotically large values of @xmath59 at finite polariton lifetimes can be understood in terms of the asymmetry of the perturbation generated by the defect in the ( e.g. , photonic ) wave - function , @xmath104  see fig .",
    "[ fig : peaks ] .",
    "while , as explained later , we observe the disappearance of the cherenkov waves for large enough polariton densities , even at asymptotically large polariton densities we always observe two small perturbations in the fluid wave - function around the defect , one just in front and one just behind the defect in the @xmath49-direction , i.e. , in the polariton flow direction .",

    "it is clear from the definition   that , in this limit , the drag force measures the degree of asymmetry of such two perturbations . as the perturbation becomes symmetric around the defect in the limit of large polariton lifetimes , the drag force vanishes .",
    "we find that the shorter the polariton lifetime the smoother is the crossover observed in the drag force from supersonic to superfluid behaviour . instead ,",

    "we find that , while eventually the cherenkov waves disappear at large enough densities , the persistence of asymmetric perturbations around the defect , which we ascribe to finite lifetime effects , contributes to give a finite drag force .",

    "in particular , the angle formed between the waves and the propagation direction increases by increasing the polariton density . note also that , while qualitatively the phenomenology of the cherenkov waves seems to be well described by the linear approximation theory , the transition from the supersonic to the subsonic superfluid regime is not . in particular , we find a value range of the pump power ( like the one shown in the third row of fig .

    "@xcite , we have found that , the disappearance of the cherenkov waves , characterising the transition from a supersonic to a subsonic superfluid behaviour , is not well described by the linear theory . in addition , we have found that non - equilibrium effects which go beyond the linear approximation cause a finite residual drag force even at asymptotically large polariton densities , where the landau criterion predicts that no elementary excitation can be emitted by the defect . only in the limit of infinitely long polariton lifetimes , the residual drag force at large enough densities goes to zero , recovering the equilibrium limit .",
    "the drag force exerted on the polariton fluid by a defect , as well as the height of cherenkov radiation , and the percentage of particles scattered by the defect show a smooth crossover rather then a sharp threshold - like behaviour which is typical of superfluids obeying the landau criterion .",

    "alternatively , the defect can be switched on and off externally by an additional laser  @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that , even in the limit of asymptotically large densities , where in linear response approximation the system satisfies the landau criterion , the fluid always experiences a residual drag force when flowing through the defect . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the result in terms of the polariton lifetime being finite , finding that the equilibrium limit of zero drag can only be recovered in the case of perfect microcavities . in general , both the drag force exerted by the defect on the fluid , as well as the height of cherenkov radiation , and the percentage of particles scattered by the defect , </S>",
