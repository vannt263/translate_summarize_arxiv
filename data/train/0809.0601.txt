    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are the best known cosmological distance indicators at high redshifts .",
    "their use led to the discovery of the currently accelerating expansion of the universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) ; see filippenko ( 2005 ) for a review .",
    "they were also used to reveal an early era of deceleration , up through about 9 billion years after the big bang ( riess et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "larger , higher - quality samples of sne  ia , together with other data , are now providing increasingly accurate and precise measurements of the dark energy equation - of - state parameter , @xmath7 ( e.g. , astier et al .",

    "2007 ; wood - vasey et al . 2007 ; kowalski et al . 2008 ) .",
    "though the increase in the empirical knowledge of sne  ia has led to an enormous advance in their cosmological use , the understanding of the explosion mechanism still requires careful evaluation ( e.g. , hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ; wheeler 2007 ) . while in type ii sne we have the advantage that the explosion leaves a compact star to which surviving companions ( if they exist ) often remain bound , thus enabling a large number of studies ( e.g. , martn et al .",

    "1999 ) , in sne  ia the explosion almost certainly does not produce any compact object .    to investigate how the explosion takes place",
    ", we examine the rates of sne  ia at high redshifts , or we can take a more direct approach and survey the field of historical sne ia . the latter strategy has been followed since 1997 in a collaboration that used the observatories at la palma , lick , and keck ( ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "2004 ) . the stars appearing within the 15@xmath8 innermost area of the remnant of sn 1572 ( @xmath9 ) were observed both photometrically and spectroscopically at multiple epochs over seven years .",
    "the proper motions of these stars were measured as well using images obtained with the wfpc2 on board the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ ( go9729 ) .",
    "the results revealed that many properties of any surviving companion star of sn 1572 were unlike those predicted by hydrodynamical models .",
    "for example , the surviving companion star ( if present ) could not be an overluminous object nor a blue star , as there were none in that field .",
    "red giants and he stars were also discarded as possible companions .    a subgiant star ( g2  iv ) with metallicity close to solar and moving at high speed for its distance was suggested as the likely surviving companion of the exploding white dwarf ( wd ) that produced sn 1572 ( ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "this star , denoted tycho g , has coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "comparisons with a galactic model showed that the probability of finding a rapidly moving subgiant with solar metallicity at a location compatible with the distance of sn 1572 was very low . a viable scenario for",
    "the tycho sn 1572 progenitor would be a system resembling the recurrent nova u  scorpii .",
    "this system contains a white dwarf of @xmath12  and a secondary star with @xmath13  orbiting with a period @xmath14  d ( thoroughgood et al . 2001 ) .    on the other hand , based on analysis of low - resolution spectra , ihara et al .",
    "( 2007 ) recently claimed that the spectral type of tycho g is not g2  iv as found by ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but rather f8  v. in addition , ihara et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested the star tycho  e as the companion star of the tycho sn 1572 , but we consider their conclusion to be unjustified .",
    "they base it on a single feature at 3720   in a spectrum having a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of only @xmath15 .",
    "the short spectral range of their data ( 36004200   ) and the low resolution ( @xmath16 , with a dispersion of 5   / pixel ) add to our concern .",
    "the present work resolves questions regarding the metallicity and spectral classification of tycho g. we concentrate on providing both the chemical composition of the star and the stellar parameters as derived from new data .",
    "in addition , we present a detailed chemical analysis of tycho g aimed at examining the possible pollution of the companion star by the supernova . although more data are still required to definitively settle this issue , the overall properties of this star remain consistent with being the surviving companion of sn 1572 .",
    "in order to perform an abundance analysis of tycho g , spectra of it were obtained with the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) on the keck  i 10-m telescope ( mauna kea , hawaii ) .",
    "nine spectra ( with individual exposure times of 1200  s and 1800  s ) were obtained on 10 september 2006 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) and four spectra ( with exposure times of 1800  s ) on 11 october 2006 , covering the spectral regions 39305330   , 53806920   , and 69808560   at resolving power @xmath17 .    the spectra were reduced in a standard manner using the makee package .",
    "we checked in each individual spectrum the accuracy of the wavelength calibration using the [ ] @xmath186300.3 and @xmath185577.4 night - sky lines and found it to be within 0.2 . after putting each individual spectrum into the heliocentric frame , we combined all of the spectra from each night .",
    "then , each night s final spectrum was cross - correlated with the solar spectrum ( kurucz et al .",
    "1984 ) properly broadened with the instrumental resolution of @xmath19  .",
    "the final hires spectrum of tycho g has a snr of @xmath20 at 5200   , @xmath21 at 6500   , and @xmath22 at 7800   .",
    "this spectrum was not corrected from telluric lines since it was unnecessary for the chemical analysis ( see   [ seciron ] ) .        with the aim of determining",
    "the spectral classification of several targets in the tycho sn 1572 field , on 12 december 2007 we obtained spectra with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck  i telescope .",
    "we used the 400/3400 grism , the 400/8500 grating , and the d560 dichroic , covering the range 31809150   .",
    "the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) resolution was 6.4   in the red part ( @xmath23   ) and 6.3   in the blue , with respective dispersions of 1.86   pixel@xmath24 and 1.09   pixel@xmath24 .",
    "tycho e , f , g , and d were observed in single exposures of 700 , 200 , 400 , and 450  s , respectively ; see ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for star identifications .",
    "the snr of the individual spectra is 21 , 37 , 31 , and 25 at 4600   for tycho  e , f , g , and d , respectively .",
    "these spectra were reduced using standard techniques ( e.g. , foley et al .",
    "2003 ) , including removal of telluric absorption lines .",
    "the spectrum of tycho  g is shown in figure 1 ; spectra and classifications of the other stars are available in appendix  [ ap1 ] .",
    "in general , our results do not support the spectral classifications suggested by ihara et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which are based on low - resolution ( @xmath25 ) , low - snr spectra obtained with the instrument focas at the subaru telescope over a short spectral range ( 36004200   ) . moreover , their relative flux calibrations are questionable since they apply a correction to the slope of each spectrum that is fitted when comparing with a template .",
    "thus , we consider their spectral classifications to be unreliable .",
    "the blue and red parts of the lris spectra were merged and then rebinned at a scale of 2   pixel@xmath24 . we compared the spectra of the four targets with a library of low - resolution stellar spectra from jacoby , hunter , & christian ( 1984 ) .",
    "we chose this library because the spectra have a similar resolution ( @xmath264.5   ) , with a dispersion of 1.4   pixel@xmath24 , and cover a similar spectral region ( 35107427   ) as our lris observations .",
    "the low - resolution comparison with template spectra depends on the color excess applied to the lris spectra .",
    "we dereddened the calibrated spectra according to the parameterization of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , including the update for the near - ultraviolet given by odonnell ( 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , there is uncertainty in the spectral classification of each template .",
    "thus , the spectral classification of stars using low - resolution spectra must always be considered only as an initial guess .",
    "the best fit is found for a reddening @xmath27 mag , with @xmath28 ( see below for details ) .",
    "this value of reddening was used in the comparison shown in figure  [ lrtg ] . in the library of jacoby et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , there are not many spectra with luminosity class iv ( only f0 , f3 , g2 , g5  iv ) , whereas luminosity class v is very well sampled with several templates for each spectral type .",
    "if only low - resolution spectra are used to derive the spectral and luminosity classes , the results may be erroneous , since they depend on reddening and on the flux calibration of the observed spectra .        nonetheless , as a first step , we compare the lris spectrum of tycho g with the low - resolution spectra of three template stars having different spectral types ( fig .",
    "[ lrtg ] ) . to evaluate the goodness of fit",
    ", we employ a reduced @xmath29 statistic , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of wavelength points , @xmath32 is the number of free parameters ( here one ) , @xmath33 is the template flux , @xmath34 is the target flux ( in this case , tycho g ) , and @xmath35 .",
    "the snr was estimated as a constant average value in the continuum over the range 46104630   ; this region was also used to normalize both target and template spectra .",
    "the spectral regions used to evaluate @xmath29 are 38506800   and 70007400   , avoiding strong telluric lines near 6900   present only in the template spectra .",
    "the best fit is found for the g2  iv template with @xmath28 , whereas the f8  i and f6  v templates provide @xmath36 and 9.66 , respectively .",
    "ihara et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have claimed that the spectral type of tycho g could be either f8  i , f8  v , or f6  v , rather than g2  iv as found by ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "however , our analysis shows that those other spectral types provide worse fits than the g2  iv template .        in the following sections we use more accurate classification methods , which are independent of reddening , to derive not only the spectral type of tycho g but actually the effective temperature and surface gravity , using a high - resolution spectrum .",
    "the wings of h@xmath37 are a very good temperature indicator ( e.g. , barklem et al .",
    "2002 ) . adopting the theory of ali & griem ( 1965 , 1966 ) for resonance broadening and griem ( 1960 ) for stark broadening , we computed h@xmath37 profiles for several effective temperatures , using the code synthe ( kurucz et al .",

    "2005 ) . for further details on the computations of hydrogen lines in synthe , see castelli & kurucz ( 2001 ) and cowley & castelli ( 2002 ) .",
    "figure  [ halpha ] compares these synthetic h@xmath37 profiles with the observed profile for several temperatures . to evaluate the goodness of fit",
    ", we employ the same method as in the previous section . however , in this case @xmath38 ( the effective temperature @xmath39 ) , @xmath33 is the synthetic normalized flux , @xmath34 is the observed normalized flux , and @xmath40 .",
    "the snr was estimated as a constant average value in continuum regions close to the observed h@xmath37 profile .",
    "the fitting regions are indicated in figure  [ halpha ] , which contains all of the spectral regions close the center of the h@xmath37 profile where there are no stellar lines and where the normalized flux is greater than @xmath41 .",
    "the best fit provided a temperature of @xmath42@xmath43 k , with the error bars estimated from the best fits after displacing the observed continuum up and down by @xmath44 .    in the following section ,",
    "we adopt the currently most reliable method for the determination of the stellar parameters .",
    "the best determination of the atmospheric parameters of can be obtained from the ionization equilibrium of iron .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths of 32 and 10 isolated lines using an automatic line - fitting procedure which performs both line detection and gaussian fits to unblended lines ( franois et al .",
    "the analysis was done using the 2002 version of the code moog ( sneden 1973 ) and a grid of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) model atmospheres ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "we adopted the atomic data from santos , israelian , & mayor ( 2004 ) , where the @xmath45 values are adjusted until the solar atlas ( kurucz et al .",
    "1984 ) is reproduced with a kurucz model for the sun having @xmath42@xmath46 k , @xmath1  @xmath47 dex , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 dex .",
    "this line list was designed to determine stellar parameters of planet - host stars with roughly the same atmospheric parameters and metallicity as tycho g ; it provides a compilation of 42 completely unblended fe lines ideal for the determination of stellar atmospheric parameters . note that none of the stellar lines used in this work for chemical analysis is affected by telluric lines .",
    "the atmospheric parameters were determined by iterating until correlation coefficients between @xmath50 ( ) and @xmath51 , as well as between @xmath50 ( ) and @xmath52 , were zero , and the mean abundances from and lines were the same ( see left panels of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the derived parameters were @xmath53 k , @xmath1@xmath54 dex , @xmath55 , and @xmath3 } = -0.05 \\pm 0.09 $ ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the stellar parameters were estimated as described by gonzalez & vanture ( 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the uncertainties in @xmath56 and @xmath42take into account the standard deviation of the slope of the least - squares fits , @xmath57 ( ) versus @xmath52 and @xmath50 ( ) versus @xmath51 . the uncertainty in @xmath58considers the uncertainty on @xmath42 in addition to the scatter of the abundances .",
    "finally , the uncertainty in fe abundance is estimated from a combination of the uncertainties in @xmath56 and @xmath42 , in addition to the scatter of the abundances , all added in quadrature .        in figure [ fig1 ] , we also show two set of stellar parameters , @xmath42@xmath59 k and @xmath1  @xmath60 dex ( middle panels ) , and @xmath42@xmath61 k and @xmath1  @xmath62 dex ( right panels ) , corresponding to the spectral types f8  i and f6 - 7  v ( gray 1992 ) . the lower - middle and upper - middle panels show inconsistent abundances between and , whereas the upper - right panel shows a negative slope for iron abundance versus excitation potential @xmath51 of the spectral lines",
    ". therefore , these two sets of parameters can not be the stellar parameters of tycho g. according to the spectral classification provided by gray ( 1992 ) , the stellar parameters of tycho g correspond to a spectral type of g0 - 1  iv .",
    "non - lte ( nlte ) corrections for stars with similar stellar parameters and metallicity have been estimated at @xmath63 dex for lines , while seems to be insensitive to nlte effects ( thvenin & idiart 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , santos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) compared spectroscopic surface gravities with @xmath64 using hipparcos parallaxes and found an average difference of @xmath65 dex , which might in fact reflect nlte effects on lines .",
    "our assumption of lte seems to be accurate enough to determine the surface gravity of the star within the error bars .",
    "note that ionization equilibrium also holds for si and cr ( see   [ secabun ] ) .",
    "this determination of effective temperature is consistent within the error bars with that derived from the h@xmath37 profile ( @xmath42@xmath43 k ) .",
    "however , echelle spectrographs are not ideally suited for measuring the shape of broad features such as the wings of balmer lines ( allende prieto et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the snr of @xmath2630 is not high enough for the determination of effective temperature from the h@xmath37 profile with great accuracy . for this reason , we will adopt the @xmath42@xmath66 k value for the determination of the chemical abundances .",
    "using the derived stellar parameters , we determine the element abundances from the absorption - line equivalent width ( ew ) measurements of the elements given in table  [ tblb ] , except for lithium and sulfur for which we use a @xmath29 procedure to find the best fit to the observed features ( e.g. , gonzlez hernndez et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the atomic data for o , c , s , and zn are taken from ecuvillon , israelian , & santos ( 2004 , 2006 ) , those of na , mg , al , si , ca , sc , ti , v , cr , mn , co , and ni are from gilli , israelian , & ecuvillon ( 2006 ) , and those for sr , y , and ba are from reddy et al .",

    "we display several spectral regions of the observed spectrum of in comparison with synthetic spectra computed using the derived element abundances .",
    "uncertainties in the abundances of all elements were then determined , adding in quadrature the errors due to the sensitivities of the resulting abundances to changes in assumed atmospheric parameters and the dispersion of the abundances from individual lines of each element .    in table  [ tbl2 ] we provide the average abundance of each element together with the errors .",
    "the errors in the element abundances show their sensitivity to the uncertainties in the effective temperature ( @xmath67 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath68 ) , microturbulence ( @xmath69 ) , and the dispersion of the measurements from different spectral features ( @xmath70 ) .",

    "moreover , the orbital elements just before the explosion are also different ; in particular , the separations are larger . given the orbital history up to the explosion , it is reasonable to find fast rotators around black holes and neutron stars ( gonzlez hernndez et al .",

    "[ toomrefig ] we display galactic velocity of tycho g in comparison with the galactic velocities of thick - disk and thin - disk stars .",
    "although the galactic velocity of tycho g is comparable to that of thick - disk stars , its metallicity is more common in thin - disk stars . in the lower panel of figure  [ toomrefig ] ,",
    "we display only those stars with metallicity equal to or greater than the metallicity of tycho g. the number of thick - disk stars is reduced considerably , but there are still a few thick - disk stars with the same metallicity and galactic velocity as tycho g. on the other hand , the high ni abundance of tycho g would be very unusual for a thick - disk star . we therefore conclude that while a thick - disk origin may be consistent with the data , this possibility is not favored because it provides no explanation for the anomalous ni abundance .    although the position of tycho g in the sky does not coincide with the proposed geometrical center of the x - ray and radio remnants of sn 1572 , the offset of the position is within the uncertainties due to the asymmetry resulting from interaction of the expanding remnant with the circumstellar medium . indeed , there is @xmath192 displacement along the e  w axis between the radio emission and the high - energy continuum observed by xmm - newton , in the position of the western rim ( decourchelle et al .",
    "such asymmetry amounts to a 14% offset along the e  w axis .",
    "it appears to be due to the ejecta having encountered a dense h cloud at the eastern edge , giving rise to brighter emission and lower expansion velocity of the ejecta there , while interacting with a lower - density medium in the western rim .",
    "it was precisely owing to those considerations that we studied all of the 23 stars with @xmath193 mag within a circle of radius @xmath9 around the geometrical center of the x - ray emission as given by the chandra observations ( hughes 2000 ) .",

    "these companions , which remain bound to the black hole or neutron star created by the explosion , are main - sequence stars and subgiants with a high li abundance .",
    "the companions of core - collapse sne are polluted with @xmath37 elements , but tycho g has an overabundance of ni ( and co at lower significance level ) with respect to fe .",
    "the overabundance is well above the scatter for this ratio in galactic disk stars , suggesting that tycho g could have captured the low - velocity tail of the sn 1572 ejecta .",
    "we use sn  ia yields to model the possible contamination of the star from the sn ejecta and we find reasonable agreement with the observed abundances of tycho g.    thus , although the current evidence is not fully compelling , it remains consistent with tycho g being the surviving companion star of the white dwarf that exploded to form sn 1572 , as originally proposed by ruiz - lapuente et al .",
