    "non radial oscillations of compact stars can be excited in several astrophysical events .",
    "for instance , after a neutron star ( ns ) is formed in a gravitational collapse , or in processes that may occur during its subsequent evolution ; these include starquakes , glitches , interactions with a stellar companion , or phase transitions to quark matter or to a kaon and/or pion condensate , that may arise in the inner core of a ns if the density exceeds some critical value .",
    "all these phenomena induce perturbations which set the star in oscillation and , according to general relativity , gravitational waves ( gws ) are one of the channels through which energy is dissipated .",
    "in addition , due to rotation some modes may grow unstable through the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz mechanism ( cfs instability ) @xcite ; these instabilities may have important effects on the subsequent evolution of the star , and they may be associated to a further emission of gws , the amount of which would depend on when and whether the growing modes are saturated by non - linear couplings or dissipative processes .",
    "it is therefore important to know at which frequencies a star pulsates emitting gravitational waves , and to study under which conditions the corresponding modes become unstable .",
    "if one assumes that the star does not rotate , the mode frequencies can easily be computed by solving the equations of stellar perturbations , which have been formulated in the sixties @xcite and further developed in later years @xcite .",
    "these equations have been integrated for a large variety of equations of state proposed to describe matter in a ns @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the identification of the frequency corresponding to the excitation of a stellar mode ( for instance the fundamental mode which is likely to be the most energetic ) in a detected gravitational signal , would allow to infer interesting information on the composition of the inner core of a ns and on the equation of state of matter at supranuclear densities",
    ".    however , all stars rotate , and our present knowledge of the quasi - normal mode ( qnm ) spectrum of rotating stars is far to be complete . the perturbative approach which works so fine in the non rotating case , when generalized to include rotation shows a high degree of complexity , even if the star is only slowly rotating @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty arises because , when using the standard spherical harmonics decomposition of the perturbed tensors , modes with different harmonic indexes couple , giving rise to an infinite set of dynamical , coupled equations .",
    "for this reason , in all studies based on this approach simplifying assumptions are introduced : either the couplings between oscillations with different values of the harmonic index @xmath1 are neglected , or cowling s approximation is used ( i.e. spacetime perturbations are neglected ) @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only place where the oscillations of a slowly rotating star are studied without making use of any of these restrictive assumptions is in @xcite where , however , only @xmath2-modes have been considered .",
    "an alternative approach consists in solving the equations describing a rotating and oscillating star in full general relativity , in time domain .",
    "however , current studies based on this approach also make use of strong simplifying assumptions , or restrict to particular cases . for instance",
    ", the cowling approximation has been used in several papers @xcite ; in @xcite only quasi - radial modes ( @xmath3 ) have been considered ; in @xcite only the neutral mode ( zero - frequency mode in the rotating frame ) has been studied ; in @xcite only axisymmetric ( @xmath4 ) modes have been analysed , using the conformal flatness condition . in @xcite ,",
    "the frequencies of axisymmetric modes ( @xmath4 ) with @xmath3 to @xmath5 have been computed for rapidly rotating relativistic polytropes , using the cowling approximation ; a comparison of the results for @xmath3 obtained in the cowling approximation in @xcite , with those found in full gr in @xcite , shows that cowling s approximation introduces large errors in the determination of the fundamental mode frequency .    in this article",
    "we develop a general method to find the quasi - normal mode frequencies of a rotating star .",
    "we perturb einstein s equations about a stationary , axisymmetric background describing a rotating star .",
    "the perturbed quantities are expanded in circular harmonics @xmath6 .",
    "as we are looking for quasi - normal modes , we assume a time dependence @xmath7 , with @xmath8 complex . due to the background symmetry ,",
    "perturbations with different values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are decoupled ; thus , for assigned values of @xmath10 , the perturbed equations to solve are a 2d - system of linear , differential equations in @xmath2 and @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we do not derive explicitly the perturbed equations in the general case of rapidly rotating stars , since they will be studied in a subsequent paper .",
    "our goal here is to describe the general method .",
    "two are the main ingredients on which our method is based : i ) the perturbed equations are integrated using spectral methods ; ii ) the boundary conditions at the center of the star and at radial infinity are implemented by suitably generalizing the standing wave approach which has been used to find the qnm frequencies of non - rotating stars @xcite .",
    "these points will be described in section [ method ] . to test our approach , in section [ slowly ]",
    "we find the frequency of the fundamental mode of a slowly rotating , constant density star , as a function of the rotation rate .",
    "concluding remarks are in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the metric which we consider as a background is stationary and axially symmetric .",
    "it can be cast in the general form @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are functions of the coordinates @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in ( [ rotmet1 ] )",
    "there is still some gauge freedom , which allows to write the metric in a simpler form , like @xmath19 as in @xcite , or like @xmath20 as in @xcite , @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall not specify explicitly the gauge , but we will require that some properties are satisfied ; in particular we require : i ) that the spacetime is described by the coordinates @xmath21 , ii ) that @xmath22 , @xmath23 are killing vectors associated with stationarity and axisymmetry respectively , and iii ) that @xmath24 are polar coordinates on spheres , i.e. that the surfaces @xmath25 , @xmath26 are diffeomorphic ( but not isomorphic ) to @xmath27-spheres . as a consequence of these assumptions ( that are fulfilled by ( [ rotmet2 ] ) and ( [ rotmet3 ] ) ) any tensor field defined on one of these surfaces can formally be expanded in tensor spherical harmonics , even if the spacetime is not spherically symmetric ; this property will be useful in section [ standingrot ] .",
    "the metric and fluid velocity perturbations can be considered as tensor fields in this background ; they are expanded in circular harmonics @xmath6 , and fourier - transformed in time . since perturbations belonging to different @xmath9 and different frequency @xmath8 do not couple , in what follows @xmath9 and @xmath8 will be considered as fixed , and perturbed quantities will be decomposed as follows @xmath28 the frequency @xmath8 is , in general , complex .    by fixing the gauge , imposing @xmath29 and assigning an equation of state which relates @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,",
    "the sixteen quantities @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 reduce to ten @xmath36 . a possible gauge choice , which we call _ generalized regge - wheeler gauge _",
    ", is described in appendix [ genrw ] ; however , other gauges can be considered ( see for instance @xcite ) . for simplicity of notation , to hereafter we shall assume that the quantities @xmath37 are scalars with respect to rotation ( as they are , indeed , in the generalized regge - wheeler gauge , see appendix [ genrw ] ) ; however , every step of the approach we will describe can be applied also to tensorial quantities by a suitable generalization .",
    "einstein s equations , linearized about our stationary axisymmetric background , reduce to a system of partial differential equations ( pde ) for the functions @xmath37 in @xmath2 and @xmath11 . to find the qnm frequencies , for assigned values of @xmath9 and @xmath8",
    ", we solve these equations by imposing that all metric functions are regular near the center of the star , that the lagrangian perturbation of the pressure vanishes on the stellar surface , and that the solution at infinity behaves as a pure outgoing wave .",
    "the conditions at the center and at the surface of the star can be fulfilled for every value of @xmath8 , but the outgoing wave condition at infinity is only consistent with a discrete set of ( complex ) frequencies @xmath38 ; such frequencies are the qnm .",
    "we will now describe how to implement the boundary condition at infinity , and the numerical approach we use to solve the perturbed equations .",
    "in this section we shall generalize to the rotating case the _ standing wave _ approach @xcite used to find the qnm frequencies of non rotating stars . to this purpose , it is useful to remind how this method works .",
    "first of all it is worth stressing that by this approach @xcite one can only determine the qnm frequencies of slowly damped modes , like the @xmath39- , @xmath40- , and @xmath2-modes ; it can not be applied to highly damped modes , like stellar @xmath41-modes or black hole s qnm .",
    "it is known that the equations describing the perturbations of a non rotating , spherical star can be separated by expanding the perturbed tensors in tensorial spherical harmonics ; outside the star these equations reduce to those describing schwarzschild perturbations , and they can be reduced to the regge - wheeler @xcite and the zerilli @xcite equations , for two suitably defined functions which we both indicate as @xmath42 .",
    "the two wave equations have the following form @xmath43 z^{lm}(r,\\omega)=0,\\qquad\\quad l\\ge 2~ , \\label{rwzer}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the usual tortoise coordinate and @xmath45 is a short range potential .",
    "the qnm frequencies are the values of the complex frequency @xmath8 for which the solutions of equation ( [ rwzer ] ) , found by imposing appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the star , behave as pure outgoing waves at radial infinity , i.e. @xmath46 the standing wave approach consists in the following .",
    "let us assume that @xmath42 is an analytic function of the complex variable @xmath47 , and be @xmath48 the frequency of a qnm , with @xmath49 . in general , at radial infinity the solution of equation ( [ rwzer ] ) is a superposition of ingoing and outgoing waves , i.e. @xmath50 if @xmath51 , by definition @xmath52 ; since @xmath53 is analytic and since @xmath49 , we can expand @xmath54 near the real @xmath55 as follows @xmath56 where `` @xmath57 '' indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath58 ; then , by imposing @xmath59 we find @xmath60 using this relation the function @xmath54 , near @xmath61 ( with @xmath58 and @xmath55 real ) , can be written as @xmath62\\ , , \\label{parcompl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which it follows @xmath63~ , \\label{stanwav}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is a constant which does not depend on @xmath58 .",
    "thus , to find the frequencies of the qnm it is sufficient to integrate the wave equation ( [ rwzer ] ) for _ real _ values of the frequency @xmath58 , and find the values @xmath65 for which the amplitude of the standing wave ( [ stanwav ] ) has a minimum : these are the qnm frequencies .",
    "the corresponding damping times @xmath66 can be found through a quadratic fit of @xmath67 .",
    "let us now consider a rotating star . as discussed above , with a suitable choice of the gauge the relevant perturbed quantities reduce to a set of quantities which behave as scalars with respect to rotation : @xmath36 ( @xmath8 complex ) .",
    "they must satisfy a set of pde , obtained by linearizing einstein s equation , which can be integrated once the values of these quantities are assigned at the center of the star , i.e. on a sphere of radius @xmath68 ( hereafter @xmath69 is the stellar radius ) @xmath70 the @xmath71 are subject to constraints , which arise from the analytical expansion in powers of @xmath2 of the perturbed equations , from the assumption of regularity of the spacetime as @xmath72 , and from the requirement that the lagrangian pressure perturbation must vanish on the surface of the star .",
    "these constraints reduce the number of independent quantities from the ten @xmath71 to a smaller number , say @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 .",
    "being these quantities defined on a sphere @xmath75 , they can formally be decomposed in spherical harmonics @xmath76 where the expansion is truncated at @xmath77 .",
    "therefore the independent solutions of the perturbed equations correspond to the following set of @xmath78 $ ] constants @xmath79 given these constants , the perturbed equations for the functions @xmath80 can be integrated for @xmath81 .    in the wave zone , far away from the star , the far field limit expansion of the metric describing a rotating star shows that the metric reduces to the schwarzschild solution ( see for instance @xcite , chap .",
    "this occurs because terms due to rotation decrease faster than the `` schwarzschild - like '' components .",
    "therefore , as when dealing with schwarzschild perturbations , in this asymptotic region we can define the gauge invariant zerilli and regge - wheeler functions , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , in terms of the perturbed metric tensor , expanded in tensorial spherical harmonics with @xmath84 .",
    "this tensor is found by integrating the equations describing the perturbed spacetime outside the rotating star .",
    "the well known asymptotic behaviour of @xmath82 and @xmath83 is @xmath85 a ( complex ) frequency @xmath86 belongs to a quasi - normal mode if , for an assigned value of @xmath9 , the following condition is satisfied for _ any _ @xmath1 : @xmath87",
    "i.e. if the set of @xmath88 $ ] constants @xmath89 vanishes .",
    "it should be stressed that this is a big difference with respect to the non rotating case : in that case each mode belongs to a single , assigned value of @xmath1 , and there is degeneracy in @xmath9 .    for each assigned value of @xmath9",
    ", we define the vectors @xmath90 the dimensionality of which is @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] , respectively . since the perturbed equations are linear , these vectors are related by the matrix equation @xmath91 the constants @xmath92 do not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "the coefficients of the complex matrix @xmath93 have to be evaluated by integrating the perturbed equations .    equation ( [ eqmoderot0 ] ) , which identifies the qnm eigenfrequencies , can be written as @xmath94 a discrete set of qnm s exists if the matrix @xmath95 is square , i.e. if @xmath96 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eigeneqn ] ) is equivalent to impose @xmath97 as we will show in the appendices , by counting the number of independent equations in the cases of spherical stars and of slowly rotating stars we find indeed @xmath96 .",
    "we expect the same to hold also for rapidly rotating stars .",
    "we now summarize the procedure to solve the 2d - perturbed equations using _",
    "spectral methods_. they are , indeed , very powerful to solve 2d - differential equations , and particularly useful to implement boundary conditions . for a general discussion on spectral methods",

    "this is the asymptotic behaviour of any function of @xmath11 which is regular on the @xmath141-axis .",

    "the boundary conditions needed to solve equation ( [ zpvz ] ) can be implemented using the so - called @xmath168-_method _ : we cut the last row of ( [ dva ] ) , i.e. we set @xmath169 and replace the row with the boundary condition ; for instance , if we know that @xmath170 , the last row of the matrix equation will be replaced with @xmath171 the differential equation ( [ zpvz ] ) , with the boundary condition @xmath170 , thus reduces to a matrix equation which can be solved by @xmath172 decomposition @xcite .",
    "this approach can easily be generalized to higher order differential equations ( by replacing more rows for the associated boundary conditions ) , to systems of coupled differential equations , and to partial differential equations in @xmath173 .",
    "in this case , each function is expanded in the basis @xmath174 as follows @xmath175 where sums over chebyshev s and associated legendre s polynomials are truncated to the orders @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively ; the coefficients @xmath178 can be organized as the components of a vector , defining the collective index @xmath179(k+1)+n+1=1,2,\\dots,\\left[l-|m|+1\\right](k+1)\\ ] ] and setting @xmath180 in terms of the expansion ( [ doubleexp ] ) , pdes in @xmath173 ( in our case , the equations which describe the perturbations of rotating stars ) transform into an algebraic equation . as an example of the double expansion ( [ doubleexp ] ) , in appendix [ rwspher2d ]",
    "we show how to solve the regge - wheeler equation as a partial differential equation in @xmath173 .",
    "as a test of our method , we have solved the equations which describe the perturbations of a slowly rotating stars . following @xcite , in this case",
    "the metric and fluid velocity of the unperturbed star are @xmath181 where @xmath182 describes the dragging of the inertial frames , and all quantities are expanded at first order in the angular velocity of the star , @xmath183 .",
    "we introduce a rotation parameter @xmath184 defined by @xmath185 in the metric ( [ slowstar ] ) spherical symmetry is broken only by the term @xmath8 ; when einstein s equations are perturbed about ( [ slowstar ] ) , only terms which are linear in @xmath8 are retained , i.e. we keep terms up to order @xmath186 . as a consequence , perturbations with index @xmath1 are coupled with perturbations with indexes @xmath187 through terms that are of order @xmath186 , the analytical form of which can explicitly be derived .",
    "therefore , when we transform the perturbed equations using the double spectral decomposition described in section [ spectral ] , the resulting algebraic equations have a particularly simple form : the relevant matrix is `` almost - block - diagonal '' , each block corresponding to one value of @xmath1 ; the off - diagonal blocks couple @xmath188 .",
    "these equations can also be obtained in a different way , i.e. by expanding in chebyshev polynomials the system of ordinary differential equations in @xmath2 derived by kojima in @xcite ( hereafter , k1 ) .",

    "these equations have been integrated numerically in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) using a very strong simplification : the couplings @xmath198 were neglected ( i.e. @xmath194 and @xmath199 were set to zero ) .",
