    "kondo @xcite showed that multiple scattering of conduction electrons by a magnetic impurity yields a divergent contribution to the resistance in perturbation theory . in the following three decades a large number of sophisticated methods were applied to better understand and solve the kondo and friedel - anderson model , and it was shown that at zero temperature a friedel - anderson impurity is in a non - magnetic state . to name a few of these methods : scaling @xcite , renormalization @xcite , @xcite , fermi - liquid theory @xcite , @xcite , slave - bosons ( see for example @xcite ) , large - spin limit @xcite , @xcite , and the bethe - ansatz @xcite , @xcite . for a review see @xcite .",
    "after decades of research exact solutions of the kondo and friedel - anderson problems were derived @xcite , @xcite representing a magnificent theoretical achievement .",
    "the exact solution does not solve all questions .",

    "furthermore it is such a complex solution that only a limited number of parameters can be calculated and many non - critical or non - divergent contributions are neglected . for the majority of practical problems one uses approximate solutions .",
