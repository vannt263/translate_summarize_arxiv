    "this transition is accompanied with the appearance of a dynamical scenario , whose qualitative features can be understood by asymptotic solution of the equations for long times and control parameters close to the critical values .",
    "the asymptotic formulas establish the universal features of the glassy dynamics described by mct . on the basis of this understanding",
    ", one can construct schematic models .",
    "these are based on equations of motion which have the same general form as those derived within the microscopic theory of liquids , but use the number @xmath8 of correlators and the coupling coefficients as model parameters .",

    "the ideal liquid - glass transition described by mct is a fold bifurcation exhibited by the equations of motion .",

    "such system is specified conveniently by three control parameters : the packing fraction @xmath24 , the dimensionless attraction strength @xmath25 or the dimensionless effective temperature @xmath26 , and the relative attraction width @xmath27 .",

    "the mentioned line terminates at the critical packing fraction @xmath34 for the vitrification of the hard - sphere system .",
    "the decrease of @xmath30 with increasing @xmath29 expresses the intuitive fact that cooling stabilizes the glass state . if @xmath28 is sufficiently small , however , there appear two new phenomena .",

    "the latter continues into the glass state as glass - glass - transition line , which has an @xmath0-singularity as endpoint .",
    "these two phenomena have been found by using baxter s model for the structure factor as input of the mct equations @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the wave - vector cutoff @xmath36 used in the mct model defines the range parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the generic possibility for a transition from small-@xmath28 states with @xmath0-singularity to large-@xmath28 states without @xmath0-singularity is the appearance of an @xmath1-singularity for some critical value @xmath38 . since the @xmath16 bifurcations deal with topological singularities , the indicated scenarios are robust , i.e.",

    "near the corner formed by large-@xmath31 and the small-@xmath31 transition lines , there should occur an almost logarithmic decay of the density correlations @xmath11 , which is followed by a von - schweidler - law decay as beginning of an @xmath41-relaxation process @xcite .",

    "one concludes that the cited mct results on simple systems with short - ranged attraction reproduce some subtle features of glassy dynamics so that further studies of these systems within that theory seem worthwhile .",
    "if one shifts control parameters towards the ones specifying a higher - order singularity , the time interval for logarithmic decay expands .",
    "but , simultaneously , also the beginning of the time interval shifts to larger values .",
    "consequently , there opens a time interval of increasing length between the end of the transient and the beginning of the logarithmic decay . within this interval",
    ", the correlators are close to the critical ones @xmath43 , i.e. , to the correlators calculated for control parameters at the singularity .",

    "<S> within the mode - coupling theory for the evolution of structural relaxation in glass - forming systems , it is shown that the correlation functions for density fluctuations for states at @xmath0- and @xmath1-glass - transition singularities can be presented as an asymptotic series in increasing inverse powers of the logarithm of the time @xmath2 : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting some polynomial and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are demonstrated for schematic models describing the system by solely one or two correlators and also for a colloid model with a square - well - interaction potential . </S>"
