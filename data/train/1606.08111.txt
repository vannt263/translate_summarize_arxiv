    "the mathematician leo moser asked  @xcite the following curious question , which came to be known as the * moving sofa problem * :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what is the planar shape of maximal area that can be moved around a right - angled corner in a hallway of unit width ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    fifty years later , the problem is still unsolved .",
    "thanks to its whimsical nature and the surprising contrast between the ease of stating and explaining the problem and the apparent difficulty of solving it , it has been mentioned in several books @xcite , has dedicated pages describing it on wikipedia @xcite and wolfram mathworld @xcite , and , especially in recent years , has been a popular topic for discussion online in math - themed blogs @xcite and online communities @xcite .",
    "( as further illustrations of its popular appeal , the moving sofa problem is the first of three open problems mentioned on the back cover of croft , falconer and guy s book @xcite on @xmath5 unsolved problems in geometry , and is currently the third - highest - voted open problem from among a list of 99 `` not especially famous , long - open problems which anyone can understand '' compiled by participants of the online math research community  @xcite . ) however , as those who have studied it can appreciate , and as we hope this paper will convince you , the problem is far more than just a curiosity , and hides behind its simple statement a remarkable amount of mathematical structure and depth .",

    "<S> the moving sofa problem , posed by l.  moser in 1966 , asks for the planar shape of maximal area that can move around a right - angled corner in a hallway of unit width , and is conjectured to have as its solution a complicated shape derived by gerver in 1992 . </S>",
    "<S> we extend gerver s techniques by deriving a family of six differential equations arising from the area - maximization property . </S>",
    "<S> we then use this result to derive a new shape that we propose as a possible solution to the _ ambidextrous moving sofa problem _ , a variant of the problem previously studied by conway and others in which the shape is required to be able to negotiate a right - angle turn both to the left and to the right . unlike gerver s construction , our new shape can be expressed in closed form , and its boundary is a piecewise algebraic curve . </S>",
    "<S> its area is equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are solutions to the cubic equations @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>"
