    "the theoretically cleanest way of determining the angle @xmath6 is to utilize the interference between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 decay amplitudes @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig - interf ] .",
    "the salient feature of these transitions is that they involve only distinct quark flavors and therefore do not receive any penguin contributions . in the original idea by gronau and wyler ( gw ) @xcite the @xmath9 decay modes",
    "are used , where @xmath10 represents a @xmath2 meson which decays into a cp eigenstate .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 arises from the interference between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decay amplitudes .",
    "the main advantage of the gw method is that , in principle , the hadronic parameters can be cleanly extracted from data , by measuring the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decay rates .        in practice , however , measuring @xmath0 in this way is not an easy task . due to the values of the ckm coefficients and color suppression , the ratio between the two interfering amplitudes , @xmath13 [ see eq .",
    "( [ weakphase ] ) ] , is expected to be small , of order @xmath14 .",
    "this reduces the sensitivity to @xmath0 , which is roughly proportional to the magnitude of the smaller amplitude .",
    "it also leads to experimental difficulties in measuring the color suppressed @xmath15 mode ( and its charge conjugate ) preventing a straightforward application of the gw method @xcite .",
    "there exist a number of extensions of the original gw proposal which avoid the problem by not relying on the measurement of @xmath16 amplitude @xcite .",
    "instead several different decay modes of @xmath2 mesons such as quasi two - body @xmath2 decays with one particle a resonance ( e.g. @xmath17 @xcite ) are used .",
    "since these are really three body decays ( for instance in the example mentioned , @xmath18 decays strongly to @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) one can pose the following questions :    * can one use the complete phase space of such three - body @xmath2 decays for @xmath0 extraction ? *",
    "is it possible to avoid fits to breit - wigner forms in doing the dalitz plot analysis ?",
    "as we show in the following , the answer to both of these questions is positive .",
    "the first question was raised already in @xcite , however , most of the results and applications we present are new . for the sake of concreteness , we concentrate on the @xmath21 decay mode , while an extension to a larger set of the decay modes can be found in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the chosen decay chain is threefold .",
    "first , one expects large strong phases due to the presence of resonances .",
    "second , only cabibbo allowed @xmath2 decay modes are needed .",
    "third , the final state involves only charged particles , which have a higher reconstruction efficiency and lower background than neutrals .",
    "the price one has to pay is that a dalitz plot analysis of the data is needed .",
    "we describe how to do the dalitz plot analysis in a model - independent way , and explore the advantages gained by introducing verifiable model - dependence .",
    "the final balance between the advantages and disadvantages depends on yet - to - be - determined hadronic parameters and experimental considerations",
    ". finally , we mention that an equivalent formalism to the one we present below has been independently developed by atwood and soni in @xcite .",
    "let us focus on the following cascade decay mixing , which is a good approximation in the context of the standard model , for more details see app .",
    "a of @xcite . ] @xmath22 and define the amplitudes @xmath23 the same definitions apply to the amplitudes for the cp conjugate cascade @xmath24 , with the change of weak phase sign @xmath25 in ( [ weakphase ] ) .",
    "we have set the strong phase of @xmath26 to zero by convention , so that @xmath27 is the difference of strong phases between the two amplitudes . for the ckm elements ,",
    "the usual convention of the weak phases has been used .",
    "the value of @xmath28 is known from the measurement of the @xmath29 decay width using flavor specific decays of @xmath30 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath31 is color suppressed and can not be determined from experiment in this way @xcite . the color suppression together with the experimental values of the ratio of the relevant ckm elements leads to the theoretical expectation @xmath32 ( see recent discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "for the three - body @xmath2 meson decay we define @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the momenta of the @xmath36 respectively .",
    "we also set the magnitude @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 can vary between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the last equality the cp symmetry of the strong interaction together with the fact that the final state is a spin",
    "zero state has been used . with the above definitions ,",
    "the amplitude for the cascade decay is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath2 meson propagator .",
    "next , we write down the expression for the reduced partial decay width @xmath43\\big ) dp , \\label{decay - width } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the phase space variables , and we used the extremely accurate narrow width approximation for the @xmath2 meson propagator .",
    "the moduli of the @xmath2 decay amplitude @xmath45 can be measured from the dalitz plot of the @xmath46 decay . to perform this measurement",
    "the flavor of the decaying neutral @xmath2 meson has to be tagged .",
    "this can be best achieved by using the charge of the soft pion in the decay @xmath47 . however , the phase @xmath38 of the @xmath2 meson decay amplitude is not measurable in b - factories without further model dependent assumptions .",
    "if the three - body decay @xmath46 is assumed to be resonance dominated , the dalitz plot can be fit to a sum of breit - wigner functions , determining also the relative phases of the resonant amplitudes .",
    "this is further discussed in section [ breit - wigner ] .",
    "the other option is to use data from charm factory , where weighted averages of the sine and the cosine of the relevant phase difference may be measured ( see section  [ improving ] ) . here we assume that no charm factory data is available and develop the formalism without any model dependent assumptions .    obviously , to compare with the data , an integration over at least some part of the dalitz plot has to be performed .",
    "we therefore partition the dalitz plot into @xmath48 bins and define    [ defvar ] @xmath49    where the integrals are done over the phase space of the @xmath50-th bin . the variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 contain differences of strong phases and are therefore unknowns in the analysis . the variables @xmath53 , on the other hand , can be measured from the flavor tagged @xmath2 decays as discussed above , and are assumed to be known inputs into the analysis .    due to the symmetry of the interference term , it is convenient to use pairs of bins that are placed symmetrically about the @xmath54 line , as shown in fig .",

    "degeneracy also occurs if @xmath71 . in this case , @xmath0 can still be extracted if some of the @xmath51 and/or @xmath52 are independently measured , as discussed in the following sections .",
    "so far , we have used the @xmath72 decay sample to obtain all the unknowns , including @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are parameters of the charm system .",
    "we now show that the @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be independently measured at a charm factory  @xcite .",
    "this is done by running the machine at the @xmath73 resonance , which decays into a @xmath74 pair .",
    "if one @xmath2 meson is detected in a cp eigenstate decay mode , it tags the other @xmath2 as an eigenstate of the opposite cp eigenvalue .",

    "stated above , obtaining these independent measurements reduces the error in the measurement of @xmath0 by removing @xmath56 of the @xmath77 unknowns .    in addition , if one of the @xmath2 mesons decays into a non - cp eigenstate , we are sensitive to the @xmath52 variables as well .",
    "consider for instance a @xmath78 decaying into a @xmath79 pair , of which one decays into @xmath80 and the other decays into some general state @xmath81 .",
    "the partial decay width corresponding to the @xmath82th bin of the @xmath80 dalitz plot and the @xmath83th bin of the @xmath81 final state s phase space is @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 are defined as in . in particular , if one chooses @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) one measures @xmath91 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath81 is a cp even ( odd ) eigenstate , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and equation reduces to .",
    "if the functional dependence of both the moduli and the phases of the @xmath30 meson decay amplitudes @xmath94 were known , then the analysis would be simplified",
    ". there would be only three variables , @xmath95 , and @xmath0 , that need to be fit to the reduced partial decay widths in eq .  .",
    "a plausible assumption about their forms is that a significant part of the three - body @xmath96 decay proceeds via resonances .",
    "these include decay transitions of the form @xmath97 or @xmath98 , as well as decays through higher resonances , e.g. , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "an important feature is that there exists an overlap region of cabibbo allowed @xmath103 , @xmath104 decays , where the variation of strong phase will be large , allowing for the extraction of @xmath0 .",
    "the decay amplitude can then be fit to a sum of breit - wigner functions and a constant term .",
    "following the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite we write @xmath105 where the first term corresponds to the non - resonant term and the second to the resonant contributions with @xmath106 denoting a specific resonance .",
    "the functions @xmath107 are products of breit - wigner functions and appropriate legendre polynomials that account for the fact that @xmath2 meson is a spin @xmath39 particle .",
    "explicit expressions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the strong phases @xmath108 in the ansatz can be put to zero , while others are fit to the experimental data together with the amplitudes @xmath109 .",

    ", we expect the strong phase to be large",
    ". therefore , it may be that direct cp violation can be established in this mode even before the full analysis to measure @xmath0 is conducted . with more data , @xmath0 can be extracted assuming breit - wigner resonances ( cf .",
    "section [ breit - wigner ] ) . eventually , a model independent extraction of @xmath0 can be done ( cf . section  [ model - indep ] and  [ improving ] ) .",
    "the above proposed method for the model independent measurement of @xmath0 involves a four - fold ambiguity in the extracted value .",
    "the set of equations is invariant under each of the two discrete transformations @xmath114 the discrete transformation @xmath115 is a symmetry of the amplitude and is thus an irreducible uncertainty of the method .",
    "it can be lifted if the sign of either @xmath116 or @xmath117 is known .",
    "the ambiguity due to @xmath118 can be resolved if the sign of @xmath117 is known or if the sign of @xmath52 can be determined in at least some part of the dalitz plot for instance by fitting a part of the dalitz plot to breit - wigner functions .",
    "the @xmath13 suppression present in the scheme outlined above can be somewhat lifted if the cascade decay @xmath119 is used @xcite .",
    "here @xmath120 is a multibody hadronic state with an odd number of kaons ( for instance @xmath121 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 ) .",
    "the same formalism as outlined above applies also to this case with trivial changes @xcite .",
    "in addition to using different @xmath72 modes , statistics may be increased by employing various @xmath2 decay modes as well .",
    "an interesting possibility are cabibbo allowed , @xmath124 ,  @xmath125 , and cabibbo suppressed , @xmath126 ,  @xmath127 ,  @xmath128 decay modes , to which our formalism applies with very minor changes @xcite .    in conclusion , we have shown that the angle @xmath0 can be determined from the cascade decays @xmath129 .",
    "the reason for the applicability of the proposed method lies in the presence of resonances in the three - body @xmath2 meson decays that provide a necessary variation of both the phase and the magnitude of the decay amplitude across the phase space .",
    "the fact that no cabibbo suppressed @xmath2 decay amplitudes are used in the analysis is another advantage of the method and leads to a sensitivity on @xmath0 at order @xmath130 .",
    "however , it does involve a dalitz plot analysis with possibly only parts of the dalitz plot being practically useful for the extraction of @xmath0 . in reality , many methods have to be combined in order to achieve the required statistics for a precise determination of @xmath0 @xcite .",
