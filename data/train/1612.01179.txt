    "@xcite considered an elementary model of a reservoir , in which the thermodynamic entropy production due to the application of an external field equals to the change of the informatic entropy .",
    "let us recapitulate the main ideas of this model .",
    "it has been assumed that this reservoir is composed by @xmath0 distinguishable particles with finite energy levels .",
    "the time evolution of these particles is governed by the non - interacting hamilton operator @xmath1 each particle is considered to be in a gibbs state with a fixed inverse temperature @xmath2 and the state of the reservoir is assumed to be completely uncorrelated : @xmath3 an external field is applied instantaneously on the reservoir , i.e a unitary evolution takes place on a much smaller time scale than the time scale of the reservoir s evolution , and it is assumed that only one of the particles changes its state to @xmath4 : @xmath5 \\neq 0 , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a unitary operator .",
    "this results in @xmath0 possible reservoir states @xmath7 @xmath8 depending which particle changed its state .",
    "the reservoir changes its mean energy by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the relative entropy and we used the relation @xmath11(see eq . ) together with the fact that the von neumann entropy is unitarily invariant : @xmath12 if this mean energy is dissipated in the reservoir , then the thermodynamic entropy production is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "but the informatic entropy production is zero : @xmath13 the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite needed a new state @xmath14 instead of @xmath7 such that @xmath15 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath16 .",
    "it was conjectured that for @xmath17 the informatic entropy production rate is equal to the relative entropy @xmath18 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this conjecture was proved by csiszr _",
    "the proof generalizes the conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite for arbitrary density matrices @xmath4 and @xmath19 , which are not related any more by a unitary transformation , i.e. possibly @xmath20 , and shows that @xmath21    this whole problem can be viewed from a different angle .",
    "let us consider the approach of m. j. donald @xcite and calculate the helmholtz free energy @xmath22 of the reservoir in the state @xmath14 and @xmath23 .",
    "the difference between them is given by @xmath24 one can simply compute @xmath25 thus eq . is equivalent to @xmath26 which yields @xmath27    this means that in the thermodynamic limit the reservoir changed its equilibrium state to another equilibrium state .",
    "a natural question is to find all these thermodynamically equivalent states . in case when only one particle changed its gibbs state @xmath19 to an arbitrary state @xmath4 ,",
    "the proof in @xcite shows that the state @xmath14  where the randomization is uniform , i.e. each individual state has the same probability to change to state @xmath4  is an equilibrium state equivalent to the inital state @xmath28 .    in this paper we consider a general case",
    ": we suppose that the randomization is not uniform , hence we consider the state @xmath29 where the matrix @xmath30 contains the changing weights for all @xmath0 , such that @xmath31 $ ] when @xmath32 otherwise @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this construction allows us to study the thermodynamic limit @xmath16 .",
    "the main question is about the properties of this matrix that assure the following limit : @xmath35    a matrix @xmath30 is regular or t - matrix ( see @xcite ) , if the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath36 it is strongly regular if it is regular and ( see @xcite ) @xmath37    we are going to give an analytical proof of the following statement :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath19 be a gibbs state and @xmath4 a state such that @xmath38 .",
    "then for every strongly regular matrix @xmath30 and @xmath39 we have @xmath40    the entries of the strongly regular matrix @xmath30 must be restricted to the interval @xmath41 $ ] in order for the state in to be a real physical state of the reservoir .",
    "thus , theorem [ thm1 ] is capable to identify a large class of states for which the helmholtz free energy in the thermodynamic limit is the same as for the equilibrium state @xmath28 , where @xmath42 .",
    "the presented proof combines the idea that comes from ref .",
    "@xcite with results from ergodic theory @xcite .",
    "let us start with eq . : applying the same idea that was used in @xcite we can rewrite @xmath43 in a more suitable form .",
    "let @xmath44 , where @xmath19 is invertible ( see definition in )",
    ". then we have @xmath45    here , we can not use directly the mean ergodic theorem that was applied in @xcite or @xcite ( see proposition 1.17 in there ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will follow a very similar path to that which was given in the proof of the aforementioned proposition .",
    "the algebra underlying our problem is the same as the proposition s and hence we are going to adopt the notation used in @xcite . as we have already stated , the reservoir consists of particles with finite energy levels , and we denote by @xmath46 the dimension of the hilbert space underlying their quantum mechanical description .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the set of all @xmath48 complex matrices acting on this hilbert space . since @xmath47 is a @xmath49-algebra with identity",
    ", we consider the family of @xmath49-algebras @xmath50 the @xmath0-fold algebraic tensor products of @xmath47 .",
    "suppose that for @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , there exists a @xmath53-homomorphism @xmath54 which is embedding @xmath55 into @xmath56 such that @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the identities of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "an example would be @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "the inductive limit @xmath64 is defined by the family of @xmath53-homomorphisms @xmath65 and satisfies all the axioms of a @xmath49-algebra except that of completeness .",
    "denote by @xmath66 the completion of @xmath67 ( for the details see ref .",
    "@xcite , section 1.23 ) .",
    "the family of faithful states ( see eq . ) @xmath68 , are functionals on the particular @xmath49-algebras , which extend to a faithful state @xmath69 on the inductive limit @xmath66 . the gns representation of @xmath66 with respect to the state @xmath69 results in a triplet @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the constructed hilbert - space",
    ", @xmath72 is a @xmath53-homomorphism of @xmath66 into the set of all bounded operators @xmath73 on @xmath71 , and @xmath74 is the cyclic vector for @xmath72 .",
    "we generate the von neumann algebra @xmath75 by taking the bicommutant of @xmath76 and thus we make sure that all weakly or strongly convergent series have their limit point in @xmath77 .    just like in @xcite",
    "we are going to denote by @xmath78 the right shift on @xmath66 which is defined for @xmath79 as @xmath80 as a result , @xmath43 can be written as @xmath81 it is obvious that @xmath69 is invariant under @xmath78 .",
    "the extension @xmath82 of the state @xmath69 to @xmath77 is @xmath83 and the right shift @xmath78 can be also extended such that @xmath84 .",
    "now , the only missing link in this approach is the connection between the relative entropy @xmath85 and the state @xmath82 .",
    "let us recall the belavkin - staszewski entropy and its relation to the relative entropy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and proposition 7.11 in @xcite ) @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath38 .",
    "one can simply realize that the right hand side of the above equation is nothing else than the state @xmath88 and therefore with the help of the gns construction we get @xmath89 where @xmath74 is the cyclic vector and @xmath90 is the embedding of @xmath44 into @xmath77 .",
    "we would like to prove first that @xmath91 strongly . in order to do that we need the following theorem ( theorem [ thm4 ] ) and corollary ( corollary [ cor1 ] ) from @xcite ( see @xcite pg .  213 for the original theorem ) . for convenience of the reader",
    "we repeat a slightly modified version of two statement here .",
    "[ thm4 ] let @xmath92 be a sequentially complete , locally weakly sequentially compact , locally convex vector space with topology generated by the family @xmath93 of seminorms and let @xmath94 be a continuous linear operator such that the family of operators @xmath95 is equicontinuous in the sense that for every seminorm @xmath96 , there exists a continuous seminorm @xmath97 on @xmath92 such that @xmath98 further , let @xmath99 be a strongly regular matrix and @xmath100 then @xmath101 are well defined on @xmath92 and for every @xmath102 there exists @xmath103 . if we put @xmath104 @xmath105 then @xmath106 is a continuous linear operator not depending on a.    [ cor1 ] let @xmath92 be a banach space . if the strong limit @xmath107 exists , it is a projection on @xmath92 onto the subspace @xmath108 of all fixed points of @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , projection @xmath106 does not depend on the choice of the strongly regular matrix @xmath110 .",
    "the gns construction provides us with a hilbert space @xmath111 which is a reflexive banach space and every reflexive banach space is locally weakly sequentially compact ( see @xcite corollary  2.8.9 ) .",
    "we are going to adopt the proof of proposition 1.17 in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath112 be defined by @xmath113 the map @xmath112 is an isometry on @xmath114 : @xmath115 here , we used the fact that @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath74 a cyclic vector and @xmath117 is strongly dense in @xmath118 we can extend @xmath119 isometrically to @xmath120 . since @xmath119 is an isometry and @xmath121",
    ", @xmath122 is an equicontinuous family on @xmath111 . which means that we can apply theorem [ thm4 ] and corollary [ cor1 ] to our situation , where @xmath123 is a strongly regular matrix .",
    "the isometry @xmath119 plays the role of @xmath109 , hence we need to find the fixed point subspace of @xmath119 .",
    "since the matrix @xmath110 does not play any role in finding this subspace , the proof of proposition 1.17 in @xcite works verbatim and therefore the dimension of @xmath124 is one .",
    "since @xmath125 the @xmath126 is in @xmath124 and hence @xmath127 .    if @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the commutant of @xmath77 , and @xmath130 , @xmath131 , then @xmath132 by [ cor1 ] , where @xmath133 is the projection of @xmath120 onto @xmath124 .",
    "we need to find the image @xmath134 . in order to do that , first note , that @xmath135 for all @xmath136 . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath136 and then    @xmath137    because @xmath110 is a strongly regular matrix and hence regular ( @xmath138 for all @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath141 therefore we have @xmath142 by strong continuity the result extends to @xmath120 . since @xmath74 is cyclic we have that @xmath143 for all @xmath144 and therefore @xmath145 .",
    "thus @xmath146 we know from the proof of proposition 1.17 in @xcite that @xmath74 is cyclic for @xmath147 , as well , hence @xmath148 strongly . if we choose @xmath149 then @xmath150 and we are done .",
    "we can finish the proof now .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath151 is a compact subset of the interval @xmath41 $ ] and the function @xmath87 is continuous on this set .",
    "the continuous functional calculus preserves the strong convergence .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath152 strongly . therefore with the aid of eq . @xmath153 and the proof is complete .    similarly , one can also obtain for @xmath154 with @xmath155 , @xmath156 and fixed @xmath157 the limit relation @xmath158 this result extends the statement of ref .",
