    "1 .   @xmath37 2 .",
    "@xmath40 3 .",
    "@xmath23 4 .",
    "@xmath38    conditions 1 and 2 are easily verified , as it is well - known that complete @xmath0-partite graphs and their complements can be recognized in @xmath44 time .    the degree sequence of @xmath2 can be obtained in @xmath44 time and the cardinality of each number in the sequence can be found in @xmath45 time .",
    "then , condition  3 is satisfied if and only if the cardinality of each number @xmath46 in @xmath9 is an integer multiple of @xmath47 and condition 4 is satisfied if and only if the cardinality of each number @xmath46 in @xmath9 is an integer multiple of @xmath48 .",
    "each of these can be checked in linear time , so the overall time complexity of verifying conditions 3 and 4 is @xmath49 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the conditions of theorem 1 and corollary 2 are not very restrictive , in the sense that the graphs satisfying them form large families and may be quite structurally complex .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that these families of graphs have the following properties :    1 .",
    "arbitrary ( asymptotic ) density or sparsity 2 .",
    "no forbidden subgraph characterization 3 .",
    "no special structure like being co - graphs or perfect graphs ; see fig . 1 .     with independence number 4 .",
    "this graph contains as induced subgraphs the path @xmath50 and the cycle @xmath51 , which are forbidden induced subgraphs for co - graphs and perfect graphs . ]    in fact , as shown below , finding the independence and clique numbers of graphs in these families is np - complete ; thus , it is useful to have the characterizations of ( k+1)-clique - free and @xmath52-independent set - free graphs given by theorem  1 and corollary  2 .    if @xmath38 or @xmath53 , then finding @xmath18 and @xmath17 is np - complete .",
    "let @xmath54 be the problem of finding the independence number of a cubic graph ; it is well - known that @xmath54 is np - complete @xcite .",
    "let @xmath55 be the problem of finding the independence number of a graph which is degree equivalent to a disjoint union of cliques .",
    "we will demonstrate a polynomial reduction of @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an arbitrary cubic graph with @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the disjoint union of four copies of @xmath2 ; thus @xmath57 . obviously , the time and space needed to construct @xmath58 is polynomial in @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 , since pairwise non - adjacent vertices may be chosen independently in each copy of @xmath2 in @xmath58 .",
    "thus , @xmath55 is np - complete , as well .",
    "furthermore , the time and space needed to construct the complement of an @xmath3-vertex graph is polynomial in @xmath3 , and the clique number of a graph is equal to the independence number of its complement .",
    "thus , the problem of finding the clique number of a graph which is degree equivalent to a complete multipartite graph is np - complete , as well .",

    "; thus , the caro - wei bound yields @xmath65 .",
    "using this fact , corollary 2 ( and thus theorem 1 ) is equivalent to the following statement .",
    "let @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 .    by remark 1 ,",

    "in contrast , it is easy to check that existing bounds like the ones below are not sharp for the families of graphs in corollaries 3 and 4 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     thus , we have shown that a complete @xmath0-partite graph is the only graph which does not contain a @xmath52-clique among all degree - equivalent graphs .",
    "equivalently , a disjoint union of @xmath0 cliques is the only graph which does not have a @xmath52-independent set among all degree - equivalent graphs .",
    "these results can be formulated as bounds on the independence and clique numbers , which are sharper than existing bounds on large families of graphs .",
    "for technical simplicity , we will prove corollary 3 , which is equivalent to theorem 1 .",

    "we want to show that @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath2 has a connected component @xmath72 which is a clique , @xmath73 also satisfies the conditions of corollary 3 , and @xmath74 if and only if @xmath67 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , suppose that @xmath2 has no clique components .    if @xmath75 , by corollary 1 , @xmath67 and we are done .",
    "thus , suppose @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be a partition of the vertices of @xmath2 , where @xmath79 has @xmath62 vertices of degree @xmath80 .",

    "we will first show that @xmath83 and then by induction that @xmath84 .",
    "note that @xmath85 can not have a clique component of size @xmath86 , because such a component would also be a clique component in @xmath2 , and we assumed @xmath2 has no clique components ( there could possibly be smaller clique components in @xmath85 ) .",
    "also note that for any @xmath13 and @xmath87 , @xmath88)\\leq d(v;g)$ ] ; thus , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "now , suppose for contradiction that @xmath91 and let @xmath92 be a maximum independent set in @xmath85 , @xmath93 .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath94    where the first inequality is a basic fact in set theory , the second inequality follows because @xmath95 , and the third inequality follows because @xmath93 .    if @xmath96 , then there must be a vertex @xmath97 which is not adjacent to any of @xmath98 , so @xmath99 is an independent set , contradicting that @xmath100 is a maximum independent set .    if @xmath101 , then all inequalities in ( [ eq2 ] ) must be equalities , so @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which implies that @xmath104 are pairwise disjoint . now ,",
    "if @xmath105 $ ] is not a clique for some @xmath106 , then there are two vertices @xmath97 and @xmath107 in @xmath108 which are not adjacent . then , @xmath109 is an independent set of size @xmath110 , contradicting that @xmath100 is a maximum independent set .",
    "thus , @xmath111 $ ] must be a clique for each @xmath112 and hence also @xmath113 $ ] must be a clique for each @xmath112 .",
    "but this means there are @xmath114 clique components of size @xmath86 in @xmath85  a contradiction .",
    "thus , @xmath83 , so there is an independent set @xmath115 in @xmath85 .",
    "recall that @xmath116 , so we can say that @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 ( in fact , each of these hold with equality ) .",
    "now for the inductive step , suppose that @xmath120 is an independent set in @xmath121 for some @xmath122 , and that @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath123 .",
    "the vertices in @xmath124 can not collectively be adjacent to every vertex of @xmath125 , since    @xmath126    @xmath127    the strict inequality follows from the assumption that @xmath128 .",
    "thus , there must be a vertex @xmath129 in @xmath125 which is not adjacent to any vertex in @xmath124 .",
    "this vertex can be added to @xmath124 , so @xmath130 . moreover , since @xmath129 is in one of @xmath131 , @xmath132 as required for the inductive step .    in particular , for @xmath133",
