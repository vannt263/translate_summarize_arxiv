    "open clusters have long been recognized as important tools in the study of the galactic disk .",
    "their value lies in the improvement in accuracy for distance determination , metal content , reddening and age produced by the collective stellar sample which shares these properties .",
    "so open clusters are excellent tracers of the abundance gradient along the galactic disk as well as many other important disk properties , such as the age - metallicity relation , abundance gradient evolution , disk age , and so on @xcite .",
    "the open cluster m48 , also known as ngc 2548 is a quite conspicuous object and should be a naked - eye object under good weather conditions .",
    "it was firstly studied by @xcite who made @xmath2 photoelectric photometry of 37 stars , from which the cluster turned out to have a reddening @xmath3 and a distance 630 pc .",
    "ddo photoelectric photometry of 5 red giants was obtained by @xcite . from 4 members of these red giants ,",
    "he conclude that this cluster has a metallicity [ fe / h]=0.1 , @xmath4 and a distance of 530 pc .",
    "@xcite derived an age of 0.30 gyr based on a synthetic composite color - magnitude diagram .",
    "@xcite determined absolute proper motions and membership probabilities for 501 stars in the field of m48 .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained a new result of m48 taken in the @xmath5 sdss filter system .",
    "they find that a distance of 700 pc , an age of 0.40 gyr and a metallicity of [ fe / h]=0.0 can fit their data best .",
    "in this paper we present a new photometric result of m48 taken with batc multi - color survey photometric system .",
    "the batc filter system consists of 15 filters of band - widths 150  350 that cover the wavelength range 3300  10000 , which avoids strong and variable sky emission lines @xcite . as the first object in batc survey ,",
    "the old open cluster m67 has been studied based on color - magnitude diagram ( cmd)@xcite . using the batc filter system , @xcite studied the globular cluster ngc 288 by comparing seds of bright stars with kurucz models .",
    "the estimated effective temperatures and average value of [ fe / h ] for these stars are consistent with spectroscopic determinations . based on the batc survey observations ,",
    "the main aim of this study is to determine simultaneously the fundamental parameters of m48 , such as age , distance , metallicity and reddening , by comparing observational seds of cluster stars with theoretical stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the observations and reduction of the m48 data are described in sec .",
    "2 . in sec . 3",
    ", we derive fundamental parameters of m48 .",
    "conclusions and summary are presented in sec .",
    "the observations are done with batc photometric system at xinglong station of national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) .",
    "the 60/90 cm f/3 schmidt telescope is used with a ford aerospace @xmath6 ccd camera at its main focus .",
    "the field of view of the ccd is @xmath7 with a plate scale of 1.7 arcsec per pixel .",
    "the filter system of batc project is defined by 15 intermediate - band filters which are designed specifically to avoid most of the known bright and variable night sky emission lines .",
    "the definition of magnitude for the batc survey is in the @xmath8 system which is a monochromatic @xmath9 system first introduced by @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath9 is the appropriately averaged monochromatic flux ( measured in unit of @xmath11 ) at the effective wavelength of the specific pass - band @xcite . in batc system ,",
    "the @xmath9 is defined as @xcite : @xmath12 which ties directly the magnitude to input flux .",
    "the system response @xmath13 actually used to relate the spectrum energy distribution of the source @xmath14 and @xmath9 , includes only the filter transmissions .",
    "other effects , such as the quantum efficiency of the ccd , the response of the telescope s optics , the transmission of atmosphere , etc . , are ignored .",
    "this makes the batc system filter - defined , and the effective wavelengths are affected only at the @xmath15 level after taking ccd quantum efficiency and aluminum reflection into account @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration of the batc photometric system is defined by four spectrophotometric standard stars of @xcite : hd 19445 , hd 84937 , bd+262606 and bd+ 174708 .",
    "the fluxes of the 4 standard stars have been re - calibrated by @xcite .",
    "their magnitudes in batc system have been slightly corrected recently by cross checking with the data obtained on a number of photometric nights @xcite .    in the nights judged photometric by the observers , the standard stars were observed between air - masses 1.0 and 2.0 for each filter band",
    ". the observing procedure of survey program field and photometry are described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of the very low quantum efficiency of the thick ccd used in the bluest filters , two batc filters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not used in the observation of m48 field . in table [ tb1 ] , for each batc filter , we list the corresponding effective wavelength , fwhm and exposure time .      preliminary reductions of the ccd frames , including bias subtraction and field flattening , were carried out with an automatic data reduction procedure called _ pipline i _ which has been developed as a standard for the batc survey in naoc @xcite .",
    "the astrometric plate solution is obtained by _ a priori _ knowing the approximate plate center position , and then using this information to register the brighter stars in each frame with the guide star catalog ( gsc ) coordinate system @xcite .    a _",
    "pipeline ii _ program which based on the daophot ii stellar photometric reduction package of stetson @xcite was used to measure the instrumental magnitudes of point sources in batc ccd frames .",
    "the _ pipeline ii _ reduction procedure was performed on each single ccd frame to get the psf magnitude of each point source .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were then calibrated to batc standard system @xcite .",
    "the average calibration error of each filter is less than 0.02 mag .",
    "the other sources of photometric error include photon statistics of star and sky , readout noise , random and systematic errors from bias subtraction and flat - fielding , and the psf fitting , are considered in _ pipeline ii _ and the total estimated errors of each star are given in the final catalog @xcite .",
    "stars which are detected in at least 3 filters are included in the final catalog .",
    "cmd is the main tool to derive the fundamental parameters of star cluster . in the batc photometric system",
    ", 15 filters can be used to form various cmds .",
    "however , it is difficult to derive a consistent result from various different cmds . in the other hand ,",
    "the large number of bands available in our data set provides a sort of _ low resolution spectroscopy _ , which defines the sed of each star quite well .",
    "so it is possible to derive the fundamental parameters of star cluster by fitting the seds of member stars with theoretical stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the observed sed of a star is determined by intrinsic ( mass , age , metallicity ) and extrinsic ( distance and reddening ) parameters .",
    "the member stars in a star clusters share the same age , metallicity , reddening and distance .",
    "the idea of our new method is to compare the observed seds of member stars with theoretical models to obtain a combination of best - fitting cluster parameters .",
    "our fitting procedure can be separated into two steps .",
    "first , we calculate the deviation between observed and theoretical seds of each member star with different sets of cluster parameters including age , metallicity , distance and reddening : @xmath18=m_{x_{obs}}+5 - 5\\log r - r_{x}\\times e(b - v)\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the observed magnitude of a cluster member in filter @xmath20 , @xmath21 $ ] is the absolute magnitude corrected by distance @xmath22 and reddening @xmath23 , @xmath24 is extinction coefficient which transform the @xmath23 to the batc filter system and derived by @xcite based on the procedure in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "the criteria of fit for a cluster member @xmath25 between observed sed and theoretical model is defined by : @xmath26=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum\\{m_{x}[e(b - v),r]-m_{x}\\}^{2}}{n}}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the theoretical magnitude of a star in filter @xmath20 , computed from an chosen theoretical isochrone models with age @xmath28 , metallicity @xmath29 and mass @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the number of filters used in the fit .    for any set of cluster parameters combination , we can find the smallest value of @xmath32 viz .",
    "@xmath33}$ ] for the member star @xmath25 and give the best - matched theoretical mass of that star",
    ". then we can get the total deviation of all member stars of cluster under this set of fundamental parameters . @xmath34=\\frac{\\sum{min_{\\zeta_{s}\\,[\\log(t),z , r , e(b - v)]}}}{n}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the number of cluster members used in the fit . for a set of fundamental parameters that best match",
    "the observed and theoretical seds of cluster members will yield the minimum of @xmath36 .    as our request , dr .",
    "l.  girardi has kindly calculated isochrones of our filter system using the known batc filter transmission curves and their padova stellar evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "the padova isochrone sets are computed with updated opacities and equations of state , and a moderate amount of convective overshoot .",
    "the results of @xcite proper motion and membership study of m48 are used to determine members in this cluster .",
    "stars with membership probabilities greater than 0.7 are considered to be members @xcite .",
    "all stars considered as members based on their proper motions were used in our fitting .    in our fitting procedure ,",
    "the distances was chosen from 600 pc to 900 pc in intervals of 10 pc , @xmath23 from 0.00 to 0.10 in intervals of 0.01 .",
    "theoretical isochrone models with metallicity @xmath37 0.08 , 0.019 , 0.030 and age @xmath28 from 8.0 to 9.0 in intervals of 0.05 were chosen .",
    "we find that , with a distance of 780 pc , reddening @xmath0 , the theoretical model with age of 0.32 gyr and metallicity @xmath1 give the smallest value of @xmath36 and best fit the observed seds . in figure",
    "[ sed ] , we plot the best - fitting results for some member stars .",
    "the mass of each object in padova models is labelled on the right of each corresponding curve in the unit of solar mass @xmath38 . in the top panel of figure",
    "[ sed ] , seds of 11 main sequence ( ms ) stars with mass from 1.5662 @xmath38 to 3.1878 @xmath38 are plotted . in the bottom panel of figure [ sed ] ,",
    "the sed of a red giant star is plotted .",
    "we can see that the observed seds of both ms stars and red giant stars with the derived best - fitting parameters , can fit the theoretical ones very well .    in figure [ cmd ] , we plot four representative cmds from our data : ( @xmath39 ) vs @xmath40 gives us the widest pass - band colors ; ( @xmath41 ) vs @xmath40 gives us the cleanest cmd ; and ( @xmath42 ) vs @xmath43 give us the deepest cmd .",
    "all of the cmds have a well defined ms and ms turnoff point .",
    "all stars in the field of m48 are plotted in each diagram .",
    "stars with known membership probabilities greater than 0.7 determined from the proper motion study of @xcite , are given distinct plotting symbols .",
    "in each cmd of figure [ cmd ] , parameters derived from sed - fitting are adopted .",
    "the theoretical isochrone with the parameters derived by sed - fitting can fit star s distribution in each cmd very well .",
    "the uncertainties in our derived best - fitting fundamental parameters can be determined from the observational photometric errors . for each member of cluster that used in previous fitting procedure , a new magnitude in each batc filter",
    "was generated in a monte carlo fashion by adding gaussian deviates to the observed magnitude .",
    "the standard deviations of the deviates in each batc filter were taken to be 0.05 mag which is the maximum photometric error in most filters of used sample stars .",
    "all of these stars with new artificial magnitudes were then fitted by the same procedure as previous section .",
    "we repeated this simulation 100 times . in the end , we find that the uncertainty caused by photometric errors in distance is @xmath44 pc , in reddening @xmath23 is @xmath45 , in age @xmath28 is @xmath46 .",
    "the obtained metallicity keeps the same value .",
    "so the effect of photometric errors on the best - fitting results is very small . at the same time",
    ", there still remains the possibility that there could be some sort of systematic calibration problem between the photometry and the models , or systematic errors in this particular set of photometry , although such errors are small , and not necessarily zero .    in table",
    "[ tb2 ] we list the fundamental parameters of m48 derived from this and previous works . the derived age of this work is consistent with those derived by previous works , the largest difference is 0.08 gyr @xcite .",
    "our derived distance is very close to these results derived in resent years @xcite .",
    "our derived metellicity is consistent with that of @xcite and close to the value derived by @xcite .",
    "the reddening @xmath23 derived in this work is same as that of @xcite and very close to those derived by previous works .",
    "in this paper , we present and discuss new batc multicolor photometry results for the intermediate age open cluster , m48 . comparing the observed seds of cluster member stars with the theoretical seds of padova models , we find a set best - fitting fundamental parameters for this cluster : an age of 0.32 gyr , a distance of 780 pc , a metallicity of @xmath1 with a reddening @xmath0 .",
    "this sed - fitting result can also fit cmds formed from our data very well .",
    "our derived values are also consistent with those derived by previous authors @xcite .",
    "so , we can say that using the padova theoretical isochrones , we can effectively fit our data obtained based on batc filter system with theoretical isochrones and seds to extract useful cluster information .",
