    "understanding the statistics of particle pairs dispersion in turbulent velocity fields is of great interest for both theoretical and practical implications . at variance with single particle dispersion , which depends mainly on large scale , energy containing eddies , pair dispersion",
    "is driven ( at least at intermediate times ) by velocity fluctuations at scales comparable with the pair separation .",
    "these small scale fluctuations are thought to be independent on the particular large scale flow @xcite .",
    "since fully developed turbulence displays well known , non - trivial universal features in the eulerian statistics of velocity differences @xcite , pair dispersion represents a starting point for the investigation of the general problem of the relationship between eulerian and lagrangian properties .    since the pioneering work by richardson @xcite , many efforts have been done to confirm experimentally @xcite or numerically @xcite his law",
    "nevertheless , the main obstacle to a deep investigation of relative dispersion in turbulence remains the lack of sufficient statistics due to technical difficulties in laboratory experiments and to the moderate inertial range reached in direct numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , also from an applicative point of view , a deep comprehension of the relative dispersion mechanisms is of fundamental importance for a correct modelization of small scale diffusion and mixing properties .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed investigation of the statistics of relative dispersion , obtained by numerical simulations of the advection of particle pairs in a synthetic turbulent velocity field with prescribed eulerian statistical features .    in first place",
    ", we deal with the probability distribution of lagrangian quantities in a self similar , kolmogorov - like scaling flow where we confirm the richardson - obukhov predictions .",
    "we then investigate the effects of eulerian intermittency on lagrangian statistics where we find `` lagrangian intermittency '' , i.e. deviations of the scaling exponents from the richardson values .",
    "these effects can not be captured by dimensional arguments alone .",
    "the simplest step beyond dimensional considerations is to extend the multifractal description , which is successfully used for eulerian statistics , to lagrangian quantities .",
    "we will see that our numerical simulations confirm the lagrangian multifractal predictions .",
    "the intermittency corrections to relative dispersion are however rather small .",
    "moreover , they can be hidden by the finite scaling range .",
    "huge reynolds numbers are necessary in order to discriminate clearly the scaling exponents . within this framework",
    ", we propose a new methodology for the analysis of relative dispersion data , which deals with lagrangian statistics at fixed spatial separation between particles .",
    "in particular , the statistics of `` doubling times ''  the time that two particles spend while doubling their separation  seems a very promising tool in data analysis .    in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we address the problem of relative dispersion in fully developed , homogeneous and isotropic turbulence . in section [ sec:3 ] the construction of a self similar synthetic turbulent field",
    "is described . in section [ sec:4 ] results on the lagrangian statistics of particle pairs advected by a non - intermittent velocity field are presented . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "the method of doubling times is introduced and its advantages with respect to the usual fixed time statistics are discussed . in section [ sec:6 ] is shown how to build an intermittent velocity field , and the effects of the eulerian field on lagrangian statistics are discussed . in section [ sec:7 ] conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider the dispersion of a pair of particles passively advected by an homogeneous , isotropic , fully developed turbulent field . due to the incompressibility of the velocity field the particles",
    "will , on average , separate from each other @xcite . the statistics of pairs separation is conveniently summarized by the probability density function of distances between couples of particles at a given time , @xmath0 , called _ distance neighbor function _ by richardson @xcite .    in view of the diffusive effect exerted by the turbulent motion on the advected particles ,",
    "richardson argued that the time evolution of the distance neighbor function could be described by a proper diffusion equation @xmath1 with a @xmath2 dependent scalar turbulent diffusivity @xmath3 . from a collection of experimental data ,",
    "richardson was able to obtain his celebrated `` 4/3 '' law : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "this choice for the diffusivity relied mainly on empirical grounds ( dependence of the vertical eddy diffusivity in the atmosphere with the altitude ) .",
    "the fortunate richardson choice of a rational exponent demonstrates his faith in an underlying universal physical mechanism of simple form .",
    "it is easy to realize that in three dimensions the solution of equation ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a normalization factor , which immediately leads to the growth laws for the average separation @xmath8 a discussion of the validity of diffusive approximations to the problem of pair dispersion in turbulence can be found in chapter 24.4 of monin - yaglom @xcite .",
    "the scaling ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) can actually be derived by a simple dimensional argument due to obukhov @xcite starting from kolmogorov similarity law for velocity increments in fully developed turbulence @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the particle pair separates according to @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the velocity difference evaluated along the lagrangian trajectories .",
    "assuming @xmath13 from ( [ eq:2 ] ) one obtains @xmath14 and hence the richardson law ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) .",
    "the assumption that the lagrangian velocity difference has the same ( kolmogorov ) scaling as the eulerian one relies on the intuitive idea that the main contribution to the rate of separation comes from eddies of a size comparable to that of the separation itself .",
    "after having outlined the classical arguments on relative dispersion , two remarks are in order .",
    "first , that the determination of specific functional dependencies  such as the shape of the distance - neighbor - function @xmath0  lies beyond the possibilities of similarity hypotheses , and thus calls for additional hypotheses , like equation ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "second , diffusive approximations have no possibility of capturing intermittency effects on lagrangian statistics .",
    "we have thus to face with supplementary hypotheses which have a considerable degree of arbitrariness , and whose content can be mainly judged a posteriori . in this respect",
    "the use of synthetic velocity fields represents a flexible framework for the study of the detailed features of the statistics of pair dispersion .",
    "the generation of a synthetic turbulent field which reproduces the relevant statistical features of fully developed turbulence is not an easy task . indeed to obtain a physically sensible evolution for the velocity field one has to take into account the fact that each eddy is subject to the action of all other eddies .",
    "actually the overall effect amounts only to two main contributions , namely the sweeping exerted by larger eddies and the shearing due to eddies of comparable size .",
    "this is indeed a substantial simplification , but nevertheless the problem of properly mimicking the effect of sweeping is still unsolved .",
    "it is relatively easy to construct a spatial , time independent , self affine or multiaffine velocity field in any dimension . in order to let the particle separate one has then to introduce some time dependence ( at least in two dimensions )",
    "this has been done in previous synthetic simulations either by adding a large scale flow which sweeps the particles on a quenched background of eddies @xcite , or by moving arbitrarily the eulerian structures @xcite .",
    "of course , both the solutions are rather unphysical .",
    "to get rid of these difficulties we shall limit ourselves to the generation of a synthetic velocity field in _ quasi - lagrangian _ ( ql ) coordinates @xcite , thus moving to a frame of reference attached to a particle of fluid @xmath15 .",
    "this choice bypasses the problem of sweeping , since it allows to work only with relative velocities , unaffected by advection . as a matter of fact",
    "there is a price to pay for the considerable advantage gained by discarding advection , and it is that only the problem of two - particle dispersion can be well managed within this framework .",
    "the properties of single - particle lagrangian statistics can not , on the contrary , be consistently treated .",
    "the ql velocity differences are defined as @xmath16 where the reference particle moves according to @xmath17 these velocity differences have the useful property that their single - time statistics are the same as the eulerian ones whenever considering statistically stationary flows @xcite .",
    "for fully developed turbulent flows , in the inertial interval of length scales where both viscosity and forcing are negligible , the ql longitudinal velocity differences show the scaling behavior @xmath18 where the exponent @xmath19 is a convex function of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "this scaling behavior is a distinctive statistical property of fully developed turbulent flows that we shall reproduce by means of a synthetic velocity field .    in the ql reference frame",
    "the first particle is at rest in the origin and the second particle is at @xmath22 , advected with respect to the reference particle by the relative velocity @xmath23 by this change of coordinates the problem of pair dispersion in an eulerian velocity field has been reduced to the problem of single particle dispersion in the velocity difference field @xmath24 .",
    "this yields a substantial simplification : it is indeed sufficient to build a velocity difference field with proper scaling features in the radial direction only , that is along the line that joins the reference particle @xmath15  at rest in the origin of the ql coordinates  to the second particle @xmath25 . to appreciate this simplification",
    ", it must be noted that actually all moments of velocity differences @xmath26 should display power law scaling in @xmath27 .",
    "actually these latter differences never appear in the dynamics of pair separation , and so we can limit ourselves to fulfill the weaker request ( [ eq:2.3bis ] ) .",
    "needless to say , already for three particle dispersion one needs a field with proper scaling in all directions .",
    "we limit ourselves to the two - dimensional case , where we can introduce a stream function for the ql velocity differences @xmath28 the extension to a three dimensional velocity field is not difficult but more expensive in terms of numerical resources . under isotropic conditions ,",
    "the stream function can be decomposed in radial octaves as @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "following a heuristic argument , one expects that at a given @xmath31 the stream function is essentially dominated by the contribution from the @xmath32 term such that @xmath33 .",
    "this locality of contributions suggests a simple choice for the functional dependencies of the `` basis functions '' : @xmath34 and zero otherwise , @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is a quenched random phase ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that this choice is rather general because it can be derived from the lowest order expansion for small @xmath31 of a generic streamfunction in quasi - lagrangian coordinates .",
    "it is easy to show that , under the usual locality conditions for ir convergence , @xmath39 @xcite , the leading contribution to the @xmath20-th order longitudinal structure function @xmath40 stems from @xmath41-th term in the sum ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) , @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "if the @xmath44 are stochastic processes with characteristic times @xmath45 , zero mean and @xmath46 , the scaling ( [ eq:2.3bis ] ) will be accomplished .",
    "an efficient way of to generate @xmath47 is @xcite : @xmath48 where the @xmath49 are independent , positive definite , identically distributed random processes with characteristic time @xmath50 , while the @xmath51 are independent stochastic processes with zero mean , @xmath52 and characteristic time @xmath53 .",
    "the scaling exponents @xmath19 are determined by the probability distribution of @xmath54 via @xmath55 as a last remark we note that by simply fixing the @xmath56 we recover the kolmogorov scaling .",
    "in this paper we shall consider either synthetic turbulent fields without corrections to kolmogorov scaling , i.e. @xmath57 , either fields whose intermittency corrections to the kolmogorov scaling , i.e. , nonlinear @xmath19 , are close to the experimental three dimensional turbulence exponents @xcite , see table [ table1 ] .",
    "when the advecting velocity field has kolmogorov scaling , one expects richardson law ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) to hold for the variance of pair separation .",
    "this is indeed very well verified in our numerical simulations , as shown in figure [ fig4.1 ] , over a range of separations of approximately 3 decades .",
    "observe that in the present example the effective reynolds number , defined as @xmath58 is already rather large , @xmath59 .",
    "the scaling range in the relative dispersion statistics is found to be strongly reduced with respect to that of structure functions .",
    "furthermore , by similarity arguments , the distance neighbor function @xmath0 should assume the self similar , isotropic form ( in two - dimensions ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a normalization factor and @xmath62 is a universal function whose shape is not predicted by similarity hypotheses .",
    "we checked the validity of ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) by rescaling the numerically obtained distance neighbor functions with respect to the theoretical average separation @xmath63 .",
    "the different rescaled pdf s , see figure [ fig4.2 ] , collapse onto a unique curve , which represents the shape of the universal function @xmath62 with @xmath64 .",
    "the continuous line is the richardson prediction @xmath65 rephrasing eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.1bis ] ) , which is in good agreement with the data .",
    "this result supports the empirical picture that the relative diffusion can be regarded as generated by a turbulent diffusivity , according to ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "another interesting statistics which can be investigated is the pdf of lagrangian velocity differences along the trajectory , @xmath66 .",
    "dimensional arguments give @xmath67 showing the accelerating nature of richardson dispersion @xcite . in figure [ fig4.4 ]",
    "we plot the numerical computed pdf of @xmath68 .",
    "the clear collapse of the curves for different times @xmath69 demonstrate the validity of the scaling assumption .",
    "most of the previous works concerning the validation of the richardson law have been focused mainly on the numerical prefactor ( richardson constant @xcite ) .",
    "we show that our results are realistic also for the richardson constant @xmath70 defined from the the pair dispersion law @xmath71 .",
    "the value of @xmath72 can be obtained from the second order eulerian structure function , which reads @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a universal constant related to the kolmogorov constant . according to the experimental measurements we fix @xmath75 , leading to @xmath76 for the richardson constant which is in agreement with previous values @xcite .",
    "it is worth remarking that , in the above expressions , @xmath72 is _ not _ the average energy dissipation rate of the turbulent flow .",
    "if it was so , we should be forced to conclude that in flows where no energy flux is present , no relative dispersion takes place .",
    "of course this is not the case , and the energy flux does not play a significant role in determining the intensity of the turbulent diffusivity .",
    "strong turbulent diffusivity arises as a consequence of incompressibility and non stationarity of the velocity field .",
    "thus @xmath72 has thus to be intended as a dimensional factor which simply rescales all the dimensional expressions with respect to the large scale velocity @xmath77 and lenghtscale @xmath78 .",
    "a closer look to figure [ fig4.1 ] shows that the power - law scaling regime @xmath79 is observed only well inside the inertial range . to explain this effect",
    "let us consider a series of pair dispersion experiments , in which a couple of particles is released at a separation @xmath80 at time @xmath81 . at a fixed time @xmath82 ,",
    "as customarily is done , we perform an average over all different experiments to compute @xmath83 . but , unless @xmath82 is large enough that all particle pairs have `` forgotten '' their initial conditions ,",
    "our average will be biased .",
    "this is the origin of the flattening of @xmath84 for small times , that we can call a crossover from initial condition to self similarity . in an analogous fashion",
    "there is a crossover for large times , of the order of the integral time - scale , since some couples might have reached a separation larger than the integral scale , and thus diffuse normally , meanwhile other pairs still lie within the inertial range , biasing the average and , again , flattening the curve @xmath84 .",
    "this effect is particular evident for lower reynolds numbers , as shown in figure [ fig5.1 ] for a simulation with @xmath85 .",
    "this correction to a pure power law is far from being negligible for instance in experimental data where the inertial range is generally limited due to the reynolds number and the experimental apparatus .",
    "for example , references @xcite show quite clearly the difficulties that may arise in numerical simulations with the standard approach .    to overcome this difficulty we propose an alternative approach which is based on the statistics at fixed scale , instead of at fixed time .",
    "the method is in the spirit of a recently introduced generalization of the lyapunov exponent to finite size perturbation ( finite size lyapunov exponent ) which has been successfully applied in the predictability problem @xcite and in the diffusion problem @xcite . given a set of thresholds @xmath86 within the inertial range , we compute the `` doubling time '' @xmath87 defined as the time it takes for the particle separation to grow from one threshold @xmath88 to the next one @xmath89 .",
    "averages are then performed over many dispersion experiments .",
    "the outstanding advantage of averaging at a fixed separation scale is that it removes all crossover effects , since all sampled pairs belong to the inertial range .",
    "the scaling properties of the doubling times is obtained by a simple dimensional argument .",
    "the time it takes for particle separation to grow from @xmath2 to @xmath90 can be estimate as @xmath91 ; we thus expect for the inverse doubling times the scaling @xmath92 in figure [ fig5.2 ] the great enhancement in the scaling range achieved by using `` doubling times '' is well evident .",
    "the conclusion that can be drawn by this simple example is that the doubling time statistics allows a much better estimation of the scaling exponent with respect to the standard , fixed time , statistics .",
    "this property will be used in the following section for investigating the scaling law of the relative dispersion in presence of eulerian intermittency .",
    "in former literature there are very few attempts to investigate possible corrections stemming from eulerian intermittency @xcite .",
    "this is quite surprising compared with the enormous amount of literature concerning the intermittency correction for the eulerian statistics @xcite .",
    "this mismatch is partly due to the difficulty of having experimental checks of proposed theoretical corrections .",
    "the use of synthetic velocity fields provides a first benchmark which is extremely easier and less expensive compared to experiments and direct numerical simulations .    in figure [ fig6.1 ]",
    "we report the lagrangian longitudinal structure functions @xmath93 , which are computed recording the lagrangian velocity difference whenever the pair separation equals @xmath31 .",
    "observe the wide inertial range over more than @xmath94 decades , corresponding to an integral reynolds number @xmath59 .",
    "let us remark that , due to the average growth of particle separation , also the first order lagrangian structure function is non zero .",
    "the most interesting and non - trivial result is that scaling exponents for the lagrangian structure functions show up to be almost exactly the same @xmath95 of the eulerian case ( table [ table1 ] ) . in terms of the multifractal formalism @xcite , this result",
    "is restated by saying that the fractal dimension @xmath96 for the lagrangian velocity statistics is the same of the eulerian one .    with this preliminary results in mind , we can extend the dimensional argument for the richardson law to the intermittent case by using the multifractal representation .    from the definition @xmath97 by using the multifractal representation for the velocity differences ,",
    "we can write @xmath98 the time it takes for the pair separation to reach the scale @xmath2 is dominated by the largest time in the process and can be dimensionally estimated as @xmath99 . averaging over many realizations",
    "gives the expression @xmath100 which , once evaluated by steepest descent method , gives the final result @xmath101 with scaling exponents @xmath102 \\label{eq:6.4}\\ ] ]    in the case of intermittent velocity field , the relative dispersion displays non linear scaling exponent @xmath103 ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "however there is an interesting result , already obtained in @xcite , for the case @xmath104 . from the general multifractal formalism",
    "one has that @xmath105 and the equality is satisfied for the scaling exponent @xmath106 which realizes the third order structure function @xmath21 . from ( [ eq:6.4 ] )",
    "follows that @xmath107 and thus we have that the richardson law @xmath108 is not affected by intermittency corrections , while the other moments in general are .",
    "we note that the previous argument leading to ( [ eq:6.4 ] ) is just one dimensional reasonable assumption which can be justified only a posteriori by numerical simulations .",
    "other different assumptions are possible @xcite leading to different predictions .",
    "the scaling exponents satisfy the inequality @xmath109 for @xmath110 : this amounts to say that , as time goes by , the right tail of the pdf of the separation @xmath111 becomes less and less broad .",
    "in other words , due to the effect of eulerian intermittency , particle pairs are more likely to stay close to each other than to experience a large separation .    in figure [ fig6.2 ]",
    "we show the result of the computation of @xmath112 for different @xmath20 .",
    "we find that @xmath84 displays a clear @xmath113 scaling law , but the scaling region becomes smaller for higher moments , making the determination of the exponents @xmath114 rather difficult . to overcome this difficulty we plot the moments @xmath112 compensated with @xmath115 which should result constant according to ( [ eq:6.4 ] ) . for comparison we plot also the moment @xmath116 compensated assuming normal scaling , i.e. @xmath117 .",
    "it is evident that prediction ( [ eq:6.4 ] ) is compatible with our numerical data , while the richardson scaling ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) is not . to be more quantitative , in table [ table1 ]",
    "we report the numerical @xmath103 directly obtained by a fit of @xmath112 .",
    "the numerical exponents , although affected by large uncertainty , are rather close to the theoretical ones .",
    "the time doubling analysis discussed in section [ sec:5 ] reveals very useful in the case of eulerian intermittency . to see how the scaling of the doubling times are affected by eulerian intermittency",
    ", we can give a dimensional estimate of the doubling time as @xmath91 and thus see that it fluctuates with the velocity fluctuations .",
    "after averaging over many realizations we can write @xmath118 from which follows that the doubling time statistics contains the same information on the eulerian intermittency as the relative dispersion exponents ( [ eq:6.4 ] ) . let us remark that also in this case there is the exponent @xmath119 unaffected by eulerian intermittency .",
    "as reported in figure [ fig6.3 ] our prediction is very well verified in numerical simulations .",
    "the plot of the compensated inverse time statistics clearly discriminates between multiaffine scaling ( [ eq:6.7 ] ) and affine scaling ( [ eq:5.1 ] ) ( here reported only for @xmath116 ) .",
    "note that also in the present intermittent simulations , the scaling region for the inverse time statistics is wider than that of figure [ fig6.2 ] and the scaling exponent can be determined with much higher accuracy . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we report the theoretical exponent @xmath120 of ( [ eq:6.7 ] ) compared with the direct numerical fit .",
    "the agreement is within @xmath121 .",
    "it must be pointed out that the construction of the synthetic field here proposed shows an inconsistency with the expected statistical properties imposed by navier - stokes equations .",
    "indeed , the characteristic time the the eddies of size @xmath2 are chosen to be @xmath122 .",
    "actually , since by dimensional argument @xmath123 , as long as @xmath124 are fluctuating quantities , the characteristic times also fluctuate .",
    "this effect is definitely enhanced in presence of intermittency , where the average characteristic times do not show simple scaling @xcite .",
    "this finding could shed same doubt on the validity of the results obtained up to here .",
    "we thus turn to a popular dynamical model of turbulence which seems to have been developed exactly for our purpose .",
    "shell models @xcite are deterministic models which displays a dynamic energy cascade . the model is built in terms of shell variables @xmath125 which represent the velocity differences in a wavenumber octave @xmath126 in quasi - lagrangian coordinates . with a suitable choice of parameters ,",
    "the model develops chaotic dynamics which is responsible of intermittency correction to the kolmogorov scaling exponents remarkably close to the experimental data @xcite . being a complete deterministic system",
    ", the shell model also displays dynamic eddy turnover times with the same statistics expected for navier - stokes turbulence @xcite .",
    "the particular model we use is a recently proposed shell model @xcite for the complex variables @xmath125 : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the viscosity and @xmath129 is a forcing term restricted to the first two shells .",
    "the ql stream function ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) can be written in terms of the @xmath125 variables by taking @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "the scaling exponents for the eulerian structure functions @xmath19 are numerically computed and listed in table [ table1 ] . in figure [ fig6.4 ]",
    "we report the statistics of lagrangian doubling times compensated with the theoretical scaling ( [ eq:6.7 ] ) .",
    "also in this case there is evidence of anomalous scaling in agreement with the multifractal prediction , confirming our previous finding with the stochastic velocity field .",
    "this result indicates that the relative dispersion statistics is not very sensible to the details of the time dependence of the eulerian velocity field .",
    "we think this is the main reason for which previous authors @xcite were able to observe richardson dispersion even with rather artificial eulerian dynamics .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a simple and efficient method for generating a time dependent , turbulent - like velocity difference field in quasi - lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the synthetic flow is constructed with prescribed two - point scaling properties ( structure functions ) thus allowing extensive investigations of the effects of intermittency on lagrangian pair dispersion .    for non intermittent , kolmogorov scaling , turbulence",
    "we find that the original richardson approach , based on a diffusion equation for relative separation , in agreement with our simulations . in the case of intermittent turbulence",
    "we have found that relative dispersion displays anomalous scaling exponents and can not be any longer described as a self - similar process .",
    "relative dispersion intermittency can be captured by a natural extension of the multifractal representation to lagrangian quantities which leads to the theoretical prediction of lagrangian scaling exponents .",
    "we have suggested a new approach based on the lagrangian doubling times which extends the scaling range with respect to the standard , fixed time statistics , and is thus very promising for data analysis .",
    "the present work are a first step towards the clarification of lagrangian - eulerian relationship in fully developed turbulence .",
