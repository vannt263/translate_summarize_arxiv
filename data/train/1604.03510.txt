    "non - abelian symmetries provide an attractive framework in terms of which to tackle the long - standing flavor problem in particle physics  @xcite . assuming light neutrinos to be majorana particles , as suggested on general grounds  @xcite",
    ", we consider the case where the neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices have remnant symmetries , both of flavour and cp types .",
    "these would ultimately reflect some unspecified flavour symmetry of the underlying gauge theory , providing also a more general framework to describe mu - tau flavor symmetry in neutrino physics  @xcite .",
    "one can show that flavor symmetries can be generated by performing two successive cp transformations  @xcite .",
    "conversely the remnant cp transformation of the lepton mass matrices can constrain the lepton flavor mixing in a quite efficient way . in particular , the majorana and dirac leptonic cp violating phases can be predicted  @xcite .",
    "if one remnant cp transformation @xmath1 is preserved by the neutrino mass matrix the @xmath1 matrix should be symmetric and unitary . by performing takagi factorization",
    "we have @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a unitary matrix . without loss of generality",
    ", we shall work in the charged lepton diagonal basis so that the lepton flavor mixing completely arises from the neutrino sector .",
    "the invariance of the neutrino mass matrix under the action of @xmath4 implies that the lepton mixing matrix @xmath5 should fulfill  @xcite @xmath6 then the lepton mixing matrix is determined to be of the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a diagonal matrix with non - vanishing entries equal to @xmath9 or @xmath10 , which is necessary for making neutrino masses positive  @xcite . without loss of generality , this matrix can be parametrized as @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the majorana phases may be changed by @xmath13 due to @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath15 is a generic three dimensional real orthogonal matrix , and it can be parametrized as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are real parameters , and a possible overall minus sign of @xmath15 is omitted since it is irrelevant to flavor mixing parameters . therefore the lepton mixing matrix is predicted to depend on three free parameters @xmath17 besides the parameters characterizing the residual cp transformation @xmath1 . in the following ,",
    "we shall classify all possible forms of the remnant cp transformations according to the number of zero elements in @xmath1 and investigate the corresponding predictions for the lepton flavor mixing parameters and their implications for the lepton cp violation in conventional neutrino oscillations , neutrinoless double beta decay as well as leptogenesis .      for three light majorana neutrinos",
    "the leptonic mixing matrix can be expressed in terms of three rotation angles and three cp violation phases  @xcite . here",
    "we will take these six independent parameters expressed within the pdg prescription given as  @xcite  : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a diagonal matrix of phases chosen as @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 is the dirac cp violation phase and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are two majorana cp violation phases . in this parametrization",
    "the mixing angles and magnitudes of the entries of the @xmath26 matrix are related as : @xmath27 the well known jarlskog - like invariant is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "it describes cp violation in conventional neutrino oscillations , and takes the form @xmath29 this expression gives a very transparent interpretation of the dirac leptonic cp invariant .",
    "there are two additional rephase invariants @xmath30 and @xmath31 , associated with the majorana phases  @xcite they take the following form @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "these invariants appear in processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay which do not depend , as expected , on the dirac invariant @xmath34 .",
    "in order to perform the classification of the remnant cp transformations in terms of texture zeros , it is necessary establish the way of counting these zero entries in the @xmath1 matrix : two zeros off - diagonal counts as one texture zero , while one zero on the diagonal counts as one texture zero  @xcite .",
    "the cp transformations are unitary - symmetric matrices and consequently have non - zero determinant .",
    "hence , the @xmath1 matrix can not be represented by a matrix with six or five zero elements . in other words ,",
    "the maximum number of zero entries in the cp transformation matrices must be four .",

    "it is remarkable that both the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath36 and the cp violation phase @xmath23 are predicted to be maximal for any values of the free parameters @xmath37 while majorana phases take on cp  conserving values .    for the type - ii @xmath1 matrix",
    "one sees that reactor and atmospheric angles are strongly correlated each other , @xmath38 given the measured value of reactor angle @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the measured values of the solar and atmospheric mixing angles can not be achieved in this case .    for the residual cp transformation with four texture zeros type - iii ,",
    "the lepton mixing matrix is related to the type - ii case through the exchange of the second and third rows , @xmath42 as a consequence , except for the atmospheric angle @xmath36 and jarlskog @xmath43 , the expressions for the rephasing invariants and mixing angles are the same as those obtained in the previous case . for the measured value of @xmath39 , the other two angles are @xmath40 and @xmath44 .",

    "<S> we provide a classification of generalized cp symmetries preserved by the neutrino mass matrix according to the number of zero entries in the associated transformation matrix . we determine the corresponding constrained form of the lepton mixing matrix , characterized by correlations between the mixing angles and the cp violating phases . </S>",
    "<S> we compare with the corresponding restrictions from current neutrino oscillation global fits and show that , in some cases , the dirac cp phase characterizing oscillations is highly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> implications for current and upcoming long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments t2k , no@xmath0a and dune , as well as neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the cosmological implications of such schemes for leptogenesis . </S>"
