    "the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "@xcite was the natural successor to the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) , and has primarily been used to undertake detailed studies of individual objects and regions . however , _",
    "iso _ also provided an opportunity to perform survey work at sensitivities beyond the reach of _ iras_. the _ iras _ survey was of profound significance for cosmology , extragalactic astrophysics and for the study of stars , star - forming regions and the interstellar medium in the galaxy .",
    "the mapping of large - scale structure @xcite in the galaxy distribution , the discovery of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( see the review by sanders & mirabel ) and of hyper - luminous infrared galaxies like _ iras _ f10214 + 4724 @xcite , and the detection of proto - planetary discs around fairly evolved stars , were all unexpected discoveries of the _ iras _ survey .",
    "the @xmath2 galaxy f10214 + 4724 , was at the limit of detectability by _ iras _",
    "( @xmath3jy ) .",
    "several other @xmath4 galaxies and quasars have now been found from follow - up of faint _ iras _ samples .",
    "recent sub - mm surveys , in particular with scuba on the jcmt , ( e.g. smail et al .",
    "hughes et al .",
    "barger et al .",
    "eales et al .",
    "blain et al . ) are detecting sources which are probably very high redshift counterparts to these _ iras _ sources .",
    "pointed observations of high redshift quasars and radio galaxies produce detections at sub - millimetre wavelengths in continuum and line emission , but mostly lie below the limit of the _ iras _ survey at far infrared wavelengths .    while designed as an observatory instrument , the huge improvement in sensitivity provided by _",
    "iso _ offered the opportunity to probe the galaxy population to higher redshift than _ iras _ and to make progress in understanding the obscured star formation history of the universe .",
    "a significant fraction of the mission time was thus spent on field surveys . in this paper",
    "we describe the `` european large area _ iso",
    "_ survey '' ( _ elais _ ) which represents the largest non - serendipitous survey conducted with _",
    "iso_. this survey provides a link between the _ iras _ survey , the deeper _ iso _ surveys and the sub - mm surveys .",
    "_ elais _ is a collaboration involving 25 european institutes , led from imperial college .",
    "this project surveyed around 12 square degrees of the sky at 15@xmath0 m and 90@xmath0 m nearly 6 square degrees at 6.7@xmath0 m together with a further one square degree at 175@xmath0 m .",
    "the survey used the _ iso _ camera @xcite at the two shorter wavelengths and the _ iso _ photometer @xcite at the longer wavelengths .",
    "_ elais _ was the largest open time project undertaken by _",
    "iso _ : a total of 375 hours of scientifically validated data have been produced .",
    "we have detected over 1000 extra - galactic objects and a similar number of galactic sources . around 200 of these objects",
    "have been re - observed with _",
    "iso _ to provide detailed mid / far infrared photometry .",
    "this paper outlines the broad scientific objectives of this project and describes the selection of the observing modes and survey fields .",
    "it also details the execution of the _ iso _ observations and briefly outlines the data reduction and data products .",
    "finally we show how this survey complements other _ iso _ surveys and summarise the extensive multi - wavelength programmes taking place in the _ elais _ fields .",
    "the main extra - galactic population detected by _ iras _ was galaxies with high rates of star formation .",
    "these objects are now known to evolve with a strength comparable to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. oliver et al . ) .",
    "the distance to which these objects were visible to _ iras _ was , however , insufficient to determine the nature of their evolution .",
    "the sensitivity of _ iso _ allows us to detect these objects at much higher redshifts and thus obtain greater understanding of the cosmological history of star formation .",
    "the infrared luminosity provides a better estimate of the total star formation rate than optical and uv estimators ( e.g. madau et al . ) as these monitor star formation only from regions with low obscuration and require large corrections for extinction @xcite .",
    "another important star formation indicator for galaxies is the radio luminosity ( e.g. condon ) . for galaxies obeying the well known far infrared radio correlation @xcite , the depth of the survey described here is well matched to that of sub - mjy radio surveys ( e.g. condon & mitchell , windhorst , windhorst et al .",
    ", hopkins et al . , gruppioni , mignoli & zamorani ) .",
    "comparison of the global star formation rate determined in the infrared with other determinations from the optical and uv luminosity densities , @xmath5 luminosity density , radio luminosity density , etc . will give a direct estimate of the importance of dust obscuration , vitally important for models of cosmic evolution , as well as providing us with a reliable estimate for the total star formation rate .",
    "the _ elais _",
    "follow - up surveys ( see section [ followup ] ) will allow us to go a stage further and apply a number of these complementary star formation tracers to the same volume and in many cases on the same objects , thereby addressing the impact of dust extinction independently of any peculiarities to any particular survey volume .",
    "figures [ fig : nofz15]-[fig : nofz175 ] , show the predicted redshift distribution of star - forming galaxies in the _ elais _ survey selected at 15 , 90  and 175 .",
    "the predictions come from three different evolutionary models ; the first model is that of pearson & rowan - robinson , the second and third are models ` a ' and ` e ' from guiderdoni et al . .",
    "all three models are extrapolations from _ iras _ data . the total number of objects of various different types predicted by two of these models and a third from franceschini et al .",
    ", are also tabulated in table [ tab : nsource ] .",
    "while the source counts from _ elais _ alone may not be able to distinguish between such models , spectroscopic identifications , source classifications and the redshift distributions will .",

    ", sanders et al . , veilleux et al . ,",
    "lawrence et al . )",
    "it is still a source of controversy as to whether the illumination of the dust arises principally from an agn or a star - burst .",
    "_ iso _ spectra of samples of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( genzel et al .",
    ", lutz et al . , lutz , veilleux & genzel , rigopoulou et al . )",
    "appear to demonstrate that while some do require the photoionization energies typical for agn to explain the obscured lines , most are consistent with star - burst models .",
    "interestingly , most of these objects appear to be in interacting systems , suggesting a mechanism that could trigger either an agn , a star - burst , or indeed both ( e.g. , sanders et al . , lawrence et al . , leech et al . , clements et al . ) .    the area of this survey is small compared to that of _ iras _ so we would not expect to detect large numbers of these objects .",
    "the pearson & rowan - robinson ( 1996 ) model would predict that we would detect between 40 and 80 of these objects , though models such as that of guiderdoni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which takes into account the increase in temperature of the dust with increasing luminosity would predict more .",
    "nevertheless such objects will be visible at greater distances than they were in iras and even a few examples at higher redshift would be interesting .",
    "assuming a star - burst sed @xcite an object of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) would be visible ( @xmath11 ) in the _ elais _ survey to @xmath12 where it is only visible to @xmath13 in the _ iras faint source catalog _ ( @xmath14 ) and to @xmath15 in the _ iras point source catalog _",
    "( @xmath16 ) .",
    "_ elais _ thus allows us to study samples of these controversial objects at higher redshift where both agn and star formation are known to be enhanced .",
    "figure [ fig : lumz ] shows the minimum 60  lluminosity of a source which could be detected in both the _ elais _ survey and the _ iras _ survey as a function of redshift .",
    "the orientation - based unified models of agn involve a central engine surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick torus ( antonucci & miller , scheuer , barthel , antonucci ) . in this model",
    "the optical properties of the central regions are dependent on the inclination angle of the torus , with type 2 objects defined as those with the central nucleus obscured by the torus , and type 1 objects ( such as quasars ) as those with an unobscured view of the nucleus .",
    "objects with radio jets have the jets aligned approximately with the torus symmetry axis .",
    "the scheme is very attractive in providing a single conceptual framework for what would otherwise appear to be extremely diverse populations , and the models have survived many observational tests and predictions .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the unified models are broadly correct at least to `` first order '' ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) and that many if not most type 2 agn contain obscured type 1 nuclei .",
    "an important corollary of the unified models is the expectation that populations of obscured ( i.e. type 2 ) agn will be present all redshifts .",
    "these predicted populations are in general extremely difficult to identify observationally ( e.g. halpern & moran ) except locally in low - luminosity agn , and at high redshift ( @xmath17 ) in the radio - loud agn minority .",
    "nevertheless , the strength and shape of the x - ray background has been taken as evidence of the existence of a large population of obscured quasars , outnumbering normal quasars by a factor of several ( e.g. comastri et al . ) .",
    "such a large population of obscured quasars may also explain the unexpectedly large population of local remnant black holes ( fabian & iwasawa , lawrence ) .",
    "even hard x - ray samples may miss the very heavily obscured objects , so an infrared - selected sample is the only reliable way to obtain a complete census of agn .",
    "for example , it will be possible with _ elais _ to make quantitative constraints on the dust distribution and torus column densities , as well as on the evolution of obscured quasar activity .      at the longer _ iso _ wavelengths ( 90 and 175 )",
    "emission from the cool interstellar ` cirrus ' dust in normal galaxies will be detectable in our survey in fainter and cooler objects than were accessible to _",
    "iras_. this will allow us to examine the temperature distribution functions and in particular look for unusually cool galaxies .",
    "quantifying the distributions of such cool sources will be important for deep sub - mm surveys as there is considerable degeneracy between cool , low redshift and warm high redshift objects in this wavelength regime .",
    "we expect to detect hundreds of stars at 6.7 and 15 microns and it will be of interest to check whether any show evidence of an infrared excess due to the presence of a circumstellar dust shell .",
    "such shells are expected from late type stars due to mass - loss while on the red giant branch , from cometary clouds or from proto - planetary discs . at the high galactic latitudes of our survey , late type stars with circumstellar dust shells",
    "should be rare ( e.g. rowan - robinson & harris , ) , so any detections of such shells could be especially interesting .      f10214",
    "+ 4724 @xcite was at the limit of _ iras _ sensitivity and new classes of objects may well be discovered at the limit of the _ elais _ sensitivity .",
    "the lensing phenomenon which made f10214 + 4724 detectable by _ iras _ may become more prevalent at fainter fluxes , increasing the proportion of interesting objects .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath18  far infrared background ( puget et al . , fixsen et al .",
    ", hauser et al . , lagache et al ) from _ cobe _ data has shown that most of the light produced by extra - galactic objects has been reprocessed by dust and re - emitted in the far infrared and sub - mm .",
    "this discovery provides further strong motivation for studying the dust emission from objects at all redshifts and all far infrared wavelengths .",
    "it is possible to explain this far infrared background radiation with a number of evolution models that are consistent with the _ iras _ data .",
    "the constraints provided by _ iso _",
    "surveys such as _ elais _ are expected to be able to rule out some of these a priori models .",
    "the motivation behind our 175  survey was specifically to start to resolve this far infrared background into its constituent galaxies .",
    "in order to detect as many sources as efficiently as possible we restricted ourselves to two primary _ iso _ broad band filters and aimed to cover as large an area as possible .",
    "we selected filters with central wavelengths at : 15  @xcite which is particularly sensitive to agn emission and 90  @xcite which is sensitive to emission from star formation regions . at 90",
    "we aimed to reach the confusion limit and pre - flight sensitivity estimates led us to conclude that this could be achieved with an on - sky integration time of 20s .",
    "we decided to map the same area of sky at 15using a similar total observation time and this required on - sky integration times of 40s . in both cases these integration times were close to the minimum practical .",
    "a survey area of order 10 square degrees was chosen to produce a statistically meaningful sample of galaxies .",
    "this area and depth was ideal to complement the deep _ iso - cam _ surveys ( cesarsky et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , elbaz et al .",
    ", taniguchi et al . ) as discussed in section [ isosurveys ] .",
    "a further justification for a large area survey is that many of the sources will be at relatively low redshift ( e.g. an ultra - luminous star - burst would be detectable at @xmath12 as discussed in section [ ultlum ] ) .",
    "thus , unless our survey is of a sufficient area , the volume will be such that cosmic variance can be a significant problem , i.e. large - scale clustering means that the mean density within a survey volume may not be representative of the universal mean . to estimate this effect we use the galaxy power spectrum as compiled by peacock & dodds . from this",
    "we can estimate the variance in a survey of any given volume ( we assume a cubical geometry , which means we will underestimate the variance ) . figure [ fig : cosmic_var ] illustrates the area required to study populations out to a given redshift allowing for different amounts of cosmic variance .",
    "from this we can see that a survey of around 10 square degrees is required to measure the mean density of populations visible to @xmath12 with negligible errors ( @xmath19 per cent ) due to large - scale structure . a survey with the area of _ elais",
    "_ can also measure the mean density of populations @xmath20 with 20 per cent accuracy .",
    "populations below @xmath15 would only have mean densities known to around 50 per cent .",
    "figure [ fig : cosmic_var2 ] shows what fractional errors we would expect in mean quantities derived from _",
    "elais _ for populations that are visible to different depths .    during the mission we introduced two additional filters .",
    "the first of these was designed to provide constraints on the infrared spectral energy distribution of _ elais _ sources from fields ( around six square degrees ) that would not have been observed in time for pointed _ iso _ follow - up . for this aspect of the survey we selected the 6.7  filter , which was the most sensitive for sources detected at 15@xmath0 m . naturally as well as providing",
    "improved spectral coverage of other _ elais _ sources this also produced an independent source list which was sensitive to emission from normal galaxies .",
    "the second filter , centred at 175 , was introduced specifically to explore the populations making up the far infrared background as discussed in section [ firback ] .",
    "over the course of the _ iso _ mission the _ elais _ programme was awarded a total of 377 hours .",
    "this allocation was used not only to perform the basic blank field survey observations , discussed in section  [ survey_lam ] , but also a number of other related programmes .",
    "principal among these was an _",
    "photometry programme to investigate around 200 sources that had been detected by",
    "_ elais _ in the early parts of the mission .",
    "these observations were designed to provide constraints on the spectral energy distributions of the _ elais _ sources but would also provide a serendipitous , though biased , survey in their own right .",
    "in addition we were awarded time to observe a number of sub - fields repeatedly to help quantify our reliability and completeness .",
    "we also performed eight _ iso - phot _ calibration measurements on three known stars and three _ elais _ sources , independently of the instrument team .",
    ".summary of the total time spent by",
    "_ iso _ on the _ elais _ programme .",
    "this table is broken down into observations preformed for the survey ( including reliability observations , calibration measurements and small fields ) and the photometry section of the programme .",
    "data flagged as `` aborted '' or `` failed '' by the _ iso _",
