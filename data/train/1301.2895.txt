    "first of all , we can improve the local inducing mechanism to be more realistic , e.g. , by considering that the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 might be different for different nodes , an unprotected node may only be able to induce some particular neighbours ( e.g. , in a directed network ) , or an unprotected node may recover to the protected state with certain rate , etc .. secondly , for low - dimensional lattice systems , the lattice structures and the associated short loops cause strong local and long - range correlations among the states of the nodes , which should be properly considered in a future refined theory , e.g. , by changing the form of @xmath114 to include local degree - degree correlations and by exactly computing the effects of short loops up to certain length . finally , an interesting optimization problem consists of identifying a minimal set of nodes such that perturbing these nodes to the unprotected state will cause the protected core of the whole network to breakdown . in the context of opinion dynamics or viral marketing , this amounts to identifying a minimal set of users for targeted advertisement so that we can dissolve the protected core and eventually all the users will adopt the new opinion or product .",
