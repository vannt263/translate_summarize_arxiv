    "charm meson decays are a natural place for studying light scalar mesons .",
    "these decays are a clean environment : well defined initial state , very small non - resonant component and large coupling to scalars . in addition",
    ", d decays can provide insight into the quark content of these controversial particles , since the bulk of the hadronic width comes from modes for which there is a w - radiation amplitude .",
    "studies of light scalars using charm decays started a few years ago , when e791@xcite presented results of dalitz - plot analyses of the decays @xmath3@xcite and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the decays @xmath5 and @xmath4 showed evidence for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons . in the case of @xmath5 ,",
    "the @xmath6 appears as an accumulation of signal events in low @xmath0 mass .",
    "the e791 data could only be described by an amplitude having an @xmath8 dependent phase ( @xmath8 being the @xmath9 mass squared ) .",
    "several years later , the same effect - an accumulation of signal events in low @xmath0 mass - was also observed in other decays from different experiments , for , instance , @xmath10 from cleo@xcite and belle@xcite , and @xmath11 from bes@xcite .",
    "again , the description of these data requires amplitudes with @xmath8-dependent phase .    since e791 publication of the @xmath3 results ,",
    "two kinds of criticisms have been made : the quoted values of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 parameters are not correct because the simple breit - wigner formula is inadequate to describe broad scalars , especially when near the threshold ; the other criticism is that one should not claim the existence of a resonance without showing the phase motion of the corresponding amplitude .    the breit - wigner formula , although being in this case only a naive approximation , has the key ingredient : an @xmath8-dependent phase . on the other hand , there is no single agreed way to treat broad scalars near threshold .",
    "the @xmath6 parameters depend strongly on the assumed functional form of its line shape .",
    "in this work@xcite the second criticism is addressed .",
    "the phase variation of the low - mass @xmath0 amplitude is extracted in a model independent way .",
    "in dalitz - plot analysis , resonant amplitudes are complex functions written in the general form @xmath12 .",
    "non - resonant amplitudes , in contrast , have @xmath13 constant .",
    "if two resonant amplitudes cross in some region of the dalitz - plot , they will interfere .",
    "the interference pattern in this crossing region depends on the s - dependent phases of both resonances .",
    "one can extract the phase motion of an unknown amplitude that crosses a well known resonance provided that :    * the contribution of other amplitudes is negligible in the crossing region between the amplitude under study and the known resonance ; * the integrated amplitude of the known resonance is symmetric with respect to an effective mass squared ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the second condition ensures that , by comparing the amplitude below and above @xmath14 , we end up with an expression that involves only the desired phase @xmath15 .",
    "then , we can write the approximate amplitude of this phase space region in a simple way ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the overall relative final state interaction ( fsi ) phase difference between the two amplitudes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the real magnitudes of the known resonance and the under - study complex amplitude , @xmath20 represents the most general amplitude for a two - body elastic scattering ; @xmath21 is a phase space factor to make this description compatible with @xmath22 scattering and @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the angular function and breit - wigner for the known resonance , respectively .    the quantity @xmath25 , which is the difference of the amplitudes squared after integration over @xmath26 , is computed in bins of @xmath27 .",
    "it takes the form    @xmath28    if @xmath29 is an analytical function of @xmath27 , then there will be maximum and minimum values of @xmath30 , which we can use to determine both the constant term in the above equation and the phase @xmath17 ,    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 .    finally , considering @xmath29 an increasing function of @xmath27 , we have    @xmath34    this is , in essence , the idea of the amplitude difference method @xcite . the method was shown to work in a `` calibration '' exercise using the @xmath35 resonance in the @xmath36 decay @xcite . in this case",
    "we have the @xmath35 contribution in both @xmath26 and @xmath27 axes .",
    "we were able to get a phase motion @xmath29 compatible with the @xmath35 using the @xmath35 in @xmath26 .",
    "the folded dalitz - plot distribution of the @xmath38 decay is shown fig .",
    "the horizontal and vertical axes are the squares of the @xmath39 invariant mass high ( @xmath26 ) and low ( @xmath27 ) combinations .",
    "dalitz - plot folded distribution .",
    "the events used by the ad analysis are in the hatched region .",
    "the size of the area of each bin in the plot corresponds to the number of events in that bin . ]    to study the low mass region in @xmath27 , there are three possible well known resonances in @xmath26 to act as a probe in this decay : @xmath40 , @xmath35 and @xmath41 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the @xmath40 and @xmath35 are located in regions where other amplitudes can not be considered negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "the tensor @xmath41 , @xmath42 gev@xmath43 , is placed where the @xmath40 , in the crossed channel reaches a minimum due to its decay angular distribution .",
    "with the proper choice of @xmath44 gev@xmath43 , the integral over @xmath26 of the @xmath41 amplitude squared is symmetrical : the number of events between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 gev@xmath43 ) is equal to the number of events between @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , in this region there is no significant contribution other than the @xmath49 complex amplitude under study in @xmath27 ( the amount of @xmath40 within this mass region was estimated to be @xmath505% ) . the choice of the @xmath41 as the analyser amplitude satisfies the necessary conditions for the amplitude difference method",
    ".    the acceptance and the background must be similar between @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath45 and @xmath48 , otherwise there would be biases in @xmath15 .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the acceptance is nearly uniform in this region .",
    "the background in this region comes mostly from random combinations of three pions , and it is also uniformly distributed . since we are subtracting two similar distributions , we considered the background only in the size of the statistical error .",
    "the @xmath41 angular function has a zero at about @xmath510.48 gev@xmath43 .",
    "this means a singularity in @xmath52 .",
    "this singularity is handled in the following way .",
    "the data is divided into ten @xmath27 bins .",
    "the binning is such that the singularity is placed in the middle of one bin .",
    "doing this , we isolate the singularity in a single bin ( bin 6 ) and discard its further use in the analysis .",
    "the values of @xmath17 and @xmath53 were obtained solving equations 3 and 4 .",
    "the value of the phase @xmath17 from the amplitude difference method is in agreement with that of the full dalitz - plot analysis , @xmath54 and @xmath55@xcite .    having @xmath17 and @xmath53 , the phase @xmath15 is obtained for each @xmath27 bin using equation 5 .",
    "there are ambiguities arising from the @xmath56 operation , so @xmath15 was determined with the assumption that the phase difference starts at zero at threshold and is an increasing , monotonic , smooth function of @xmath57 .    the phase motion of the low @xmath0 mass amplitude , including systematic and statistical errors , is shown in fig .",
    "2 . in spite of the limited statistics ,",
    "a strong phase variation is clearly observed .",
    "starting from zero at the threshold the phase varies by about 180@xmath58 and saturates at around @xmath59 gev@xmath43 .",
    "this is the expected behavior of resonance .",
    "the observed phase motion supports the interpretation of the @xmath2 as a true resonance .",
    "a constant or slowly varying phase would disfavor this interpretation . with more statistics we could have more bins and the pole position",
    "could be inferred .",
    "2 shows also the phase motion of the simple breit - wigner ( solid line ) used in @xcite . even considering the breit - wigner as a naive approximation",
    ", there is a qualitative agreement between its phase motion and the directly extracted @xmath15 : the description of the data requires an amplitude with a strong phase variation .    , with errors shown ( systematic and statistical in quadrature ) .",
    "the continuous line is the breit - wigner phase motion , with the e791 parameters for the @xmath2 . ]",
    "a direct , model - independent measurement of the phase motion of the low mass @xmath0 scalar amplitude was discussed . using the well known @xmath41 tensor meson in the crossing channel as the base resonance , from the @xmath1 decay , the @xmath29 phase motion was extracted .",
    "we obtain a @xmath29 variation of about 180@xmath58 , which is the expected behavior of a resonant amplitude .",
    "this result supports the interpretation of the @xmath2 as a true resonance , in agreement with the conclusions from our previous analysis of full @xmath38 dalitz - plot .",
    "we could not extract the @xmath6 pole position with this method due to the limited statistics .",
    "the measurement of the correct @xmath6 pole position from a full dalitz - plot analysis needs the correct functional form ( theorists should agree on what it is ) .",
    "whether the @xmath6 pole is the same in charm decay and scattering remains an open question .",
