    "in quantum information many quantities or properties of quantum systems are related to optimization problems that necessitate to vary over the set of all unitary transformations , density matrices or subspaces .",
    "such problems arise , for instance , in the detection and quantification of entanglement ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the properties of quantum states with respect to bell inequalities @xcite or the question of distillability @xcite . in general",
    ", such a variation can only be done efficiently by parameterizing the object of interest . in the present work the focus is on the parameterization of the unitary group @xmath0 .",
    "density matrices and orthonormal subspaces can then easily be formulated in terms of this representation . it should be emphasized that parameterizations are in general equivalent to each other and one should not be misled to conclude that one parameterization is better than the other . however , depending on the problem a certain parameterization can be advantageous by providing more insightful results or by leading to a reduction of the number of involved parameters .",
    "the simplest parameterization of @xmath0 is the canonical parameterization which is given by @xmath6 , wherein the hermitian matrix @xmath7 can be composed of a real - valued linear combination of the @xmath8 generalized gell - mann matrices and the unity @xmath9 . despite its simple form , this parameterization has the disadvantage that there is no way how redundant parameters , which appear for some tasks can be removed beforehand ( except for one parameter for the special unitary group @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus the number of parameters is always @xmath11 or @xmath8 , respectively , independent from the given problem .",
    "a different parameterization of @xmath0 and @xmath10 in terms of generalized euler angle was introduced by tilma and sudershan @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage that it allows to eliminate redundant unphysical global phases in several cases .",
    "a further parameterization of @xmath0 was recently found by jarlskog @xcite . here",
    ", the unitary matrices are formulated in a recursive way , meaning that the elements of @xmath0 are expressed in terms of the elements of @xmath12 and a further unitary matrix containing the parameters which enables the extension to @xmath1 .",
    "this parameterization also enables one to remove invariant phases , however , this is a nontrivial task as shown in @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we introduce a parameterization ( see sec.@xmath13 ) which is ideal for the formulation of density matrices ( see sec.@xmath14 ) and orthonormal subspaces ( see sec.@xmath15 ) since all redundancies can be easily identified and removed beforehand without having to consider fixed dimensions or special cases explicitly . due to its concise notation and formulation in terms of matrix exponential functions of dyadic vector products , the parameterization can be easily implemented in computational programs .",
    "moreover , the parameters have simple ranges ; when gathered in a @xmath16 matrix in a particular order , they permit an insightful interpretation of numerical computations .",
    "concrete numerical examples , in which our parameterization reduces the number of involved variables are given in sec.@xmath17 .",
    "here , we state which parameters can be discarded with respect to optimizing lower bounds of an entanglement measure ( the @xmath5-concurrence ) , as well as for clarifying distillability of quantum states .",
    "consider unitary operators @xmath18 acting on a hilbert space @xmath19 with @xmath20 spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath21 .",
    "for any @xmath22 there exist @xmath11 real values @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 $ ] for @xmath26 and @xmath27 $ ] for @xmath28 such that @xmath18 equals ] @xmath29 \\cdot \\left [ \\prod_{l=1}^{d } \\mbox{exp}(i p_l \\lambda_{l , l})\\right ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the @xmath30 are one - dimensional projectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the generalized anti - symmetric @xmath2-matrices @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "+ before we prove that any unitary operator of @xmath0 can be written in the form ( [ uc ] ) let us comment on the concept behind it : unitary transformations have the characteristic trait that they map orthonormal bases onto orthonormal bases , i.e. for a given set of vectors @xmath35 forming a orthonormal basis of a hilbert space @xmath4 the unitarily transformed set @xmath36 is also orthonormal .",
    "we are interested in the most general unitary operations transforming @xmath21 into any arbitrary orthonormal basis @xmath37 , hence our object is the unitary group of dimension @xmath1 . we know that for dimension @xmath1 the unitary group @xmath0 is a @xmath11-parameter group .",
    "this means that in order to cover all unitary transformations we must find a transformation that contains at least @xmath11 parameters ( if a parameterization involves more than @xmath11 parameters it also contains redundancies which is undesirable ) .",
    "+ regarding the basis @xmath21 , we first find that @xmath1 parameters can be embedded in global phases for each vector , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "this corresponds to the product @xmath39 of our parameterization ( [ uc ] ) .",
    "the notion behind the left part of ( [ uc ] ) is to pairwise embed two parameters in the distinctive transformations @xmath40 containing two parameters @xmath41 and @xmath23 .",
    "these transformations perform the following operations : the term @xmath42 generates a rotation in the two - dimensional subspace spanned by the vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 , while @xmath45 adds a relative phase between the vector components of the rotated vectors . note that @xmath46 is actually a @xmath15-parameter group , however , as will be proven later",
    ", the neglected two parameters would only lead to redundancies . in order to parameterize @xmath0 all terms",
    "@xmath47 have to be taken into account .",
    "there are @xmath48 ways how two vectors of @xmath21 can be combined , which corresponds to the @xmath49 generalized anti - symmetric @xmath2-matrices .",
    "one opportunity to involve all terms @xmath47 is given by building the product @xmath50 , which is clearly not unique .",
    "we now have embedded further @xmath51 parameters , which in sum with the @xmath1 global phases gives @xmath11 parameters @xmath23 in total . for convenience",
    ", these parameter @xmath23 are gathered in a @xmath16 parameterization matrix @xmath52 in this convention the diagonal entries represent global phase transformations , the upper right are related to rotations , while the lower left are relative phases ( with respect to the basis @xmath53 ) .",
    "+ we have thus constructed a @xmath11 parameter set of unitary operators .",
    "it remains to prove that this construction covers the entire unitary group @xmath0 , which is equivalent to showing that for any @xmath18 there exists a @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "+ * proof : * + let @xmath56 be an arbitrary unitary operator , i.e. @xmath57 . the conjugate transpose of @xmath54 is @xmath58\\ \\cdot \\left[\\prod_{m=1}^{d-1 } \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{m }   \\lambda_{d - m , d+1-n}^{\\dagger }   \\right ) \\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] implying that @xmath59 acts first on @xmath18 . for @xmath60",
    "this leads to @xmath61 for @xmath62 , all other components are unchanged , i.e. @xmath63 for @xmath64 . as can easily be confirmed , @xmath65",
    "can always be made zero via certain parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 and @xmath69 both are zero , both parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be chosen freely ; if only @xmath70 we choose @xmath71 and for @xmath72 we take @xmath73 .",
    "if none of both is zero then @xmath65 vanishes for @xmath67 and @xmath66 obeying @xmath74 which is achievable in any case with @xmath75 $ ] and a @xmath76 $ ] . in the same way the component @xmath77 of @xmath78 can be made zero for @xmath62 . by proceeding in this way for @xmath62",
    ", we can attain @xmath79 for all components with @xmath80 via @xmath81 . then , if @xmath82 for all @xmath83 it follows @xmath84 due to unitarity @xmath85 of @xmath86u$ ] .",
    "moreover , since @xmath87 also satisfies @xmath88 we can infer that @xmath89 for all @xmath83 .",
    "when taking into account the unitarity constraints @xmath57 for all rows and columns we conclude that @xmath87 has the diagonal form @xmath90 with @xmath91 obeying @xmath92 , which is a complex number of magnitude @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath94 . the choice @xmath95 then yields @xmath96 u_p = \\mathbbm{1}$ ] , which was to be proven .",
    "now we use our parameterization of @xmath0 to formulate density matrices .",
    "any density matrix @xmath97 acting on @xmath19 can be written in the form @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the rank of @xmath97 and @xmath102 are orthonormal vectors . for @xmath103 , i.e. pure states we only have one @xmath104 . without loss of generality ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath105 of an arbitrary state of rank @xmath106 or smaller can be expressed by means of @xmath107 real parameters @xmath108 $ ] as @xmath109 any desired set of @xmath3 orthonormal vectors @xmath110 can be constructed out of @xmath111 by applying @xmath54 .",
    "thus any @xmath97 with rank @xmath3 can be parameterized via @xmath112 a parameterization of density matrices via diagonal elements and unitary transformations can in principle be achieved with any parameterization of the unitary group @xmath0 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , the composite form of @xmath54 makes it easy to identify and eliminate all redundant parameters .",
    "the first observation is that the diagonal entries @xmath113 are redundant , since they cancel out in the outer product , i.e. @xmath114 { \\ensuremath{\\left|n\\right\\rangle } } { \\ensuremath{\\left\\langle n\\right| } } \\left [ \\prod_{l=1}^{d } \\mbox{exp}(-i p_{d+1-l } \\lambda_{d+1-l , d+1-l})\\right ] = { \\ensuremath{\\left|n\\right\\rangle } } { \\ensuremath{\\left\\langle n\\right| } } \\hspace{0.5 cm } \\forall",
    "n \\in\\{1, .. ,d\\ } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second observation is that for density matrices of rank @xmath115 we can eliminate further parameters when the composite parameterization is used .",
    "as can easily be seen @xmath97 is independent of all parameters @xmath23 where both @xmath116 @xmath117 .",
    "thus , it suffices to utilize @xmath118 with @xmath119 where the index @xmath5 is only running from @xmath93 to @xmath3 instead of @xmath93 to @xmath120 . using the introduced representation in terms of the parameterization matrix ,",
    "this is @xmath54 with @xmath121 consequently , any density matrix of rank @xmath3 or smaller acting on @xmath4 can be expressed with a maximum of @xmath122 parameters ( @xmath107 parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 parameters @xmath23 ) .",
    "the extremal scenarios are pure states with @xmath125 parameters and full rank density matrices with @xmath8 parameters .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that any set of @xmath3 orthonormal vectors can be constructed ( up to global phases ) with @xmath124 parameters .",
    "now , we prove that even less , namely @xmath126 parameters are necessary to construct an orthonormal basis of an arbitrary @xmath3-dimensional subspace of @xmath4 . consider a general subspace spanned by @xmath3 orthonormal vectors @xmath127 in a @xmath1-dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath128 be the coefficients of @xmath129 in the complete basis @xmath53 of @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath130 . a different basis of the same subspace then is of course given by the orthonormal set of vectors @xmath131 which is @xmath132 where @xmath133 is given as in ( [ distrans ] ) but with @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the @xmath136 vector of this set is @xmath137 whose k@xmath138 coefficient @xmath139 can be made zero analogously to ( [ proofa])-([proofb ] ) . in this way , with @xmath140 a basis of the subspace can be obtained where all k@xmath138 coefficients of all vectors except the last one are zero .",
    "this can then be repeated for all rows @xmath141 , such that with @xmath142 we arrive at an orthonormal basis , let us say @xmath143 , of the same subspace where all coefficients @xmath144 for all @xmath5 with @xmath145 .",
    "such a set of vectors however , can be constructed ( up to global phases ) from @xmath146 via @xmath147 where @xmath148 here , only @xmath126 parameters @xmath23 are involved since the index @xmath149 of the second product @xmath150 lies within @xmath151 . in terms of the parameterization matrix , this is @xmath54 with @xmath152 * proof : * + the proof is completely analogous to the one in section 2 and will therefore not be given in detail .",
    "one only has to take an arbitrary set of vectors @xmath153 with the mentioned properties , for which via @xmath154 it is possible to attain @xmath155 for all @xmath156 $ ] and @xmath157 $ ] - qed .",
