    "after more than 20 years since the discovery of x  ray pulsations from the prototype source , the current observational properties of axps are not yet conclusive to unambiguously assess their nature .",
    "there are currently five confirmed members of the axp class plus two candidates .",
    "although we can be reasonably confident that axps are magnetic rotating neutron stars ( nss ) , their energy production mechanism is still uncertain .",
    "it is also unclear whether they are solitary objects ( either low magnetised or magnetars ) or are in binary systems with very low mass companions ( for a review see israel et al .",
    "2002 ; mereghetti et al 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "different production mechanisms for the observed x  ray emission have been proposed , involving either accretion or the dissipation of magnetic energy .",
    "the recent detection of x  ray bursts from  and has strengthened the possible connection of axps with soft gamma ",
    "ray repeaters ( sgrs ; kaspi & gavriil 2002 ; gavriil et al .",
    "moreover the detection of relatively large pulsed fraction pulsations in the optical flux of  ( at the same period of x  ray pulses ) seems to rule out the x  ray reprocessing and favors models based on isolated nss ( kern & martin 2002 ) .",
    "the magnetar model , originally proposed by thompson & duncan ( 1993 ) to explain the properties of sgrs , appears currently to be fairly succesful at interpreting these properties of axps .    as done in the past in the case of high and low mass x ",
    "ray binary system ( hmxbs and lmxbs ) , finding the optical / ir counterparts to axps might give the key to definitively assess the nature and the emission mechanisms of axps .",
    "the lack of any known distinctive property of axps in the optical / ir bands , makes the x  ray positional accuracy at the ( sub)arcsec level a fundamental preliminary step to carry out very deep searches for potential optical / ir counterparts .",
    "moreover a high x ",
    "ray spatial resolution can be exploited to search for small scale diffuse emission or the presence of structures in the vicinity of the sources .    has been extensively studied in the x  ray band since its discovery in 1979 ( seward et al .",
    "previous searches for an optical counterpart gave negative results ( seward et al .",
    "1986 ; mereghetti et al . 1992",
    "; wang & chakrabarty 2002a ) .",
    "recently , a relatively faint ir counterpart ( @xmath0=21.7 ; @xmath0@xmath2=2.3 ) to , with unusual ir colors , has been proposed ( wang & chakrabarty 2002b ; hereafter wc02 ) .    in this paper",
    "we report on the early results obtained for  as a part of a joint eso / chandra large project aimed at the identification and study of the optical / ir counterparts of axps in the southern sky , and the study of the spatial distribution of x  ray emission from axps ( results concerning _ chandra _  observations of  and  will be reported elsewhere ) .",

    "previously determined positions of the source had limited accuracy ; 15  for _ exosat _  ( mereghetti et al . 1992 ) and @xmath34  for _ xmm  newton _  ( tiengo et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the source was observed with the high resolution imager ( hrc  i ; zombeck et al .",

    "data were reduced with ciao version 2.2 and analysed with standard software packages for x  ray data ( ciao , ximage , xronos , etc . ) .",
    "the observation was carried out with a nominal aspect solution and latest calibration files were used .",
    "four different detection algorithms were used : the ciao wavdetect and celldetect tool , the ximage sliding cell , and the wavelet  based pwdetect software developed and optimised for _ chandra _  images ( damiani et al .",
    "1997 ) . based on a statistical study performed on several point  like sources detected within the field of view of public hrc ",
    "i archival data with known optical counterparts , we found a difference up to 02 in coordinates among the four different detection methods . in the following ,",
    "we refer to the coordinates obtained with the latter method ( we assumed that differences in the coordinates among the four methods are purely statistical ) .        only one source was detected in the hrc  i .",

    "however , inspection of the attitude data during the _ xmm  newton _  observation , showed that an error radius of about 9  is likely more realistic ( tiengo 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "photon arrival times were extracted from a circular region centered on the previous reported position with a radius of 15 , including more than 90% of the source photons .",
    "these were corrected to the barycenter of the solar system and timing analysis applied ( ciao fxbary tool ) .",
    "a coherent pulsation at a period of 6.4529@xmath10.0001s was detected confirming that the detected source is indeed the axp .",
    "the latter value falls within the expected period interval extrapolated from the more accurate timing analysis obtained from a long - term _",

    "2001 ; we assumed the maximum and minimum p reported in their table1 ) .",
    "one of the aims of the _ chandra _  hrc ",
    "i observations of axps , was to study the radial profile of the x  ray emission from the axps with the unprecedented spatial resolution offered by the hrc ",
    "figure1 shows the spatial profile we obtained for the ( background subtracted ) x  ray emission from a region of 7  radius centered on the above reported source position .",
    "the radial profile is in good agreement with the expected _ chandra _  point spread function ( solid line simulated with marx ; wise et al .",
    "over the last two years we carried out deep optical and ir observations of the field including the original _ einstein _  position of .",
    "these data were obtained from the 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt , la silla , chile ) equipped with the superb seeing imager-2 ( susi2 ; 2 ccds of 2048@xmath94096 pixels ; pixel scale of 016 and 5.5@xmath95.5  field of view ) in the optical band , and with son of isaac ( sofi ; hawaii hgcdte 1024@xmath91024 array ; 0292 pixel scale and 4.9@xmath94.9  field of view ) in the near  ir band .",
    "optical johnson filter deep images ( @xmath10 ) were first carried out with susi2 in service mode on 2001 march 20 with the following effective exposure times : 2700s ( @xmath11 ) , 4350s ( @xmath12 ) , 2400s ( @xmath13 ) and 3400s ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "weather conditions were good with seeing of about 1 .",
    "standard reduction packages were applied to the optical data ( daophotii ; stetson 1987 ) to obtain the photometry of each stellar object in the images . limiting magnitudes of 25.5 ( @xmath11 ) , 25.5 ( @xmath12 ) , 24.5 ( @xmath13 ) and 23.5 ( @xmath14 ) were reached .",
    "@xmath15 images were initially carried out with sofi in service mode on 2001 may 29 ; 2700s ( each filter ) of effective exposure time .",
    "unfortunately , during observations clouds were present and the seeing was poor ( 115 ) yielding a limiting magnitude ( 3@xmath4 confidence level ) of 22.5 ( @xmath0 ) and 21 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "sofi @xmath17 images were obtained with better weather ( photometric ) and seeing ( 06 ) conditions on 2002 february 19 .",

    "single 10s - long exposure images were taken for each filter ( 5s - long in @xmath2 ) with offsets of 40  in order to sample and subtract the variable ir background .",
    "standard ir software packages were used for sky frame subtraction and image coaddition ( eclipse and irdr ; devillard 1997 and sabbey et al .",
    "2001 ) . during the latter run limiting magnitudes of @xmath0@xmath323 , @xmath16@xmath321.5 , and @xmath2@xmath320.7 were reached .    to register the _ chandra _",
    "coordinates of  on our optical / ir images , we computed the image astrometry using as reference the positions of stars selected from the usno  a2.0 catalog which has an intrinsic absolute accuracy better than 025 ( depending on magnitude and sky position of reference stars ; assafin et al .",
    "about 40 objects with magnitudes brighter than r=14 were identified in the optical and ir images and    used for astrometric calibrators .",
    "the pixel coordinates of the reference stars were computed by a two dimensional gaussian fitting procedure and transformation from pixel to sky coordinates was then computed using the graphical astronomy and image analysis tool ( gaia.pdraper/gaia/gaia.html ] ) . after taking into account the uncertainties of the source x ",
    "ray coordinates ( 07 ) , the rms error of our astrometry ( 015 ) and the propagation of the intrinsic absolute uncertainties on the usno",
    " a2.0 coordinates ( 025 ) , we estimated the final accuracy to be attached to the  position as about 08 .",
    "figure2 shows a region of 20@xmath920  around the  position in the @xmath14 and @xmath2 bands with the _ chandra _  uncertainty circle superimposed ( 90% confidence level ) .",
    "the ntt ir data show that no object is consistent with the _ chandra_position of  in the optical band down to a @xmath12 limiting magnitude of about 25.5 ( see figure2 ) . on the other hand , a faint object ( marked x3 in figure2 )",
    "is present in the ir @xmath2 frames ( @xmath0=22.1@xmath10.3 , @xmath2=19.7@xmath10.3 ) .",
    "this object is also detected in the wc02 frames , although its magnitudes are not listed .",
    "a visual inspection of the wc02 image suggests that the source x3 has remained nearly unchanged in flux with respect to our frames ( superimposing to our ir images the _ chandra _  position and uncertainty radius reported by wc02 for , the object x3 falls within the circle ) .",
    "note that during the ntt ir observations carried out on 2001 , the object x3 is not detected due to the poor seeing conditions and contamination with the nearby bright object .",
    "more surprisingly , we note that no object is detected at the position of the source x1 reported by wc02 ( the position of x1 is marked with a square in figure2 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the object marked x2 in figure2 has a magnitude of @xmath0=20.63@xmath10.06 , @xmath16=19.73@xmath10.15 and @xmath2=19.0@xmath10.2 ( consistent , within 11.5@xmath4 , with the values reported by wc02 ) .",
    "as the limiting magnitudes of our ir frames are well above the values measured by wc02 for x1 , we conclude that the source was considerably fainter during our observations .",
    "this ir brightening ( @xmath181.3 ; about a factor of 3 in flux ) , displayed by the source on a timescale of about 50 days ( the time interval between our last ir images and those of wc02 ) further strengthens the link between the ir source and .",
    "moreover , the chance probability of finding a highly variable ir source within a circle of 08 is negligible .",
    "an ir counterpart was recently found for the prototype of the axp class , , which also showed ir variability at a level of @xmath191.3 ( kaspi et al .",
    "this ir variability might be associated to the short  term x  ray bursts ( similar to those displayed by sgrs ) observed from the source three days before the ir observations ( kaspi & gavriil 2002 ) .",
    "recently , short x ",
    "ray bursts were detected in the x  ray flux of  ( gavriil et al . 2002 ) .",
    "all these findings together , suggest a close similarity of  and , such that the ir counterpart of the former might be expected to be variable . for this reason x1 is the most likely ir counterpart to ,",
    "even though source x3 is included in the _ chandra _  uncertainty circle and its color ( @xmath0@xmath2=2.4 ) is within the value interval predicted for axps ( see also figure 2 of wc02 ) .",
    "the fact that  showed two x  ray bursts close to each other , implies that many other bursts might have been missed due to the sparse x  ray monitoring with the _ r_xte .",
    "moreover since our non  detection of the ir candidate predates the wc02 detection , it would appear more natural to associate ( if at all ) the ir variability to some x  ray activity that took place between the two ir campaigns ( as opposed to the few second  duration x  ray bursts that was detected 4 months earlier ) .",
    "finally we note that the x  ray / ir observations of  are such that we do not know whether the detected ir brightening follows or precedes that in the x  ray band .",
    "future multi ",
    "wavelength monitoring programs will probably allow us to better understand these points .",
    "the non  detection of x1 in our ir frames implies that the `` quiescent '' ( or low state ) ir emission level of  is still undetected .",
    "correspondingly , it can not be ruled out yet that the spectral flattening proposed by wc02 might result from wavelength ",
    "dependent variability .",
    "similarly , the measured ir fluxes for the counterpart can not be used to study the overall ( from x  ray to ir ) energy spectrum of , since they reflect a different energy distribution than the quiescent ( or low state ) one .",
    "deeper ir observations are needed to determine the quiescent emission state of this source .",
    "ir variability might represents a new , fairly common , characteristic of axps ( and possibly sgrs ) , and potentially a diagniostic of their nature .",
    "we note that , so far , very little is known on the expected optical / ir emission from a magnetar .",
    "both models based on magnetar and accretion from `` fossil '' disk have difficulties in accounting for transient and/or variable emission at wavelengths shorter than those in the x  ray band ( thompson & duncan 1996 and references therein ; chatterjee & hernquist 2000 and references therein ) . on the other hand , the analogy with the x",
    " ray bursts of lmxbs , suggests that the effects of the x  ray burst of axps might propagate towards longer wavelengths ( e.g. , via reprocessing ) .",
    "it is somewhat intriguing that at least the values of @xmath20 and colors of the ir counterpart of  and  are similar to those displayed by some classes of accreting cataclysmic variables and low mass x ",
    "ray binaries hosting a neutron star .    the superb _ chandra _  hrc ",
    "i spatial resolution allowed us to look for extended x  ray emission around the pulsar ; this might result from an x  ray nebula powered by the axps as well as a scattering halo .",
    "a first detailed study was carried out for , where emission beyond 4  and extending up to 100  was found ( patel et al 2001 ) .",
    "however in this case the source is embedded in the diffuse emission from the supernova remnant g109.11.0 , and it is very difficult to disentangle this component from that ( possibly present ) around the axp . the present _ chandra _  hrc ",
    "i data are by far the best spatial resolution observation carried out for an axp and no significant diffuse x  ray emission was found beyond @xmath32 .",
