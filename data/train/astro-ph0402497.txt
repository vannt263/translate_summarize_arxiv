    "dormant , supermassive black holes , suspected to be present in the centers of many normal galaxies , should reveal themselves by a uv / x - ray flare when they tidally disrupt a star and some fraction of the stellar debris is accreted .",
    "tidal disruption flares were proposed by @xcite and rees ( 1988 , 1990 ) as a probe for supermassive black holes in the centers of inactive galaxies . as argued by @xcite ,",
    "the spectrum of such a flare will be characterized by the blackbody temperature of a thick disk or spherical envelope at the tidal radius , @xmath1  k for a solar - type star .",
    "the flare would begin when the most tightly bound portion of the tidal debris returns to the pericenter of the star s orbit and accretes onto the black hole .",
    "this first return would occur at a time @xmath2 following the disruption at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 yr .",
    "this estimate applies to a non - rotating star ; in the likely case that the star is spun up to near break - up before disruption , @xmath5 is reduced by the factor @xmath6 ( e.g. , li , narayan , & menou 2002 ) .",
    "the maximum return rate of debris according to numerical simulations ( evans & kochanek 1989 ) is @xmath7 yr@xmath8 and occurs at a time @xmath9 .",
    "after the peak of the flare , material returns at the declining rate @xmath10^{-5/3}\\,m_{\\sun}$ ] yr@xmath8 , which is an important factor that controls the decay of the luminosity over the next few years . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the maximum return rate is super - eddington , resulting in a flare with @xmath12 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "thus , for low - mass central black holes ( @xmath13 ) , tidal disruption theory predicts luminous flares of up to @xmath14 ergs s@xmath8 , peaking in the soft x - ray domain , with time scales on the order of months . for @xmath15 ,",
    "stellar debris takes a longer time to fall back than the time scale on which it can circularize and radiate ; in this case accretion probably proceeds through a thin disk @xcite .    the  all - sky survey ( rass ; voges et al .",
    "1999 ) conducted in 19901991 was an ideal experiment to detect these flares since it sampled hundreds of thousands of galaxies in the soft x - ray band .",
    "detected soft x - ray outbursts from several galaxies with no previous evidence of seyfert activity ( see komossa 2002 for a review ) . from the statistics of the rass , @xcite calculated a rate of @xmath16 yr@xmath8 for x - ray flares from these non - active galactic nucleus ( non - agn ) galaxies , consistent with expected rates @xcite . in order to test in an independent way whether these flares were in fact tidal disruption events , as opposed to some other form of extreme agn variability",
    ", @xcite obtained optical spectra of three of these non - agn galaxies with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) through narrow slits to search for persistent seyfert activity .",
    "these spectra were up to a factor of 100 more sensitive to nuclear activity than previously obtained ground - based data .",
    "two of the galaxies ,  @xcite and ( grupe , thomas , & leighly 1999 ) , showed no evidence of emission lines or a non - stellar continuum in their  nuclear spectra , consistent with their ground - based classification as inactive . on the other hand ,  @xcite , a starburst galaxy with strong emission lines ,",
    "was found by @xcite to have in its inner @xmath17 a nucleus with narrow emission line ratios indicating a seyfert  2 classification .",
    "this weak seyfert  2 nucleus requires a low level of prior non - stellar photoionization powered by accretion , which raises some doubt about whether its x - ray flare must have been a tidal disruption event but does not rule it out . in this paper",
    ", we report on follow - up x - ray observations with of , , and .",
    "the superb spatial resolution of  enables an even more sensitive search for nuclear x - ray activity in these now very weak x - ray sources , and resolves any non - nuclear sources of x - ray emission , both of which are needed to test more rigorously the tidal disruption hypothesis .",
    "all three targets were observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; burke et al .",
    "1997 ) on board the  x - ray observatory @xcite . in each case",
    "the galaxy was positioned on the back - illuminated s3 chip of the acis - s array .",
    "we used the standard processed and filtered event data with the latest aspect alignments , with the exception that the 0.5 pixel ( @xmath18 ) randomization that is ordinarily applied to the photon positions was reversed , restoring slightly sharper images .",
    "the @xmath19 acis pixels slightly undersample the on - axis point - spread function of the  mirrors in the restored images .",
    "table  [ tbl1 ] is a summary log of the  observations and basic results . since all of the x - ray sources are too weak to apply spectral fits , we use their count rates and reasonable assumptions about an appropriate spectral model to estimate their luminosities using the web - based simulator pimms .",
    "in order to account approximately for time - dependent degradation of the acis throughput below 1  kev , we used the pimms setup for the ao4 observing period ( 20022003 ) .",
    "systematic errors in luminosity associated with this choice will be of order @xmath20 .",
    "we quote absorbed fluxes and unabsorbed luminosities in the 0.22.4  kev band using @xmath21 km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 . since in many cases published  luminosities are quoted for the 0.12.4  kev band and @xmath22 km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 , we make the required conversions where necessary .    for illustrative comparison , we also use images of the nuclei of these galaxies that were obtained by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ccd in the course of target acquisition for our spectroscopy program reported in @xcite . these consist of small , @xmath23 windows that were exposed through the long - pass filter f28@xmath2450lp , yielding a broad band - pass from @xmath25   to 1 @xmath26 m .",
    "figure  [ image1 ] shows the stis images side by side with the  image of each target .    since the default astrometric calibration of  images is generally not as accurate as that of , we used ground - based images to derive optical positions of the nuclei of the targets with respect to the astrometric grid of usno - a2.0 stars @xcite .",
    "optical positions so derived are expected to be accurate to @xmath27 , the typical uncertainty of the usno - a2.0 astrometry .",
    "we then registered the stis images to these astrometric coordinates using the nuclei of the target galaxies .",
    "since  aspect reconstruction is known to have a random error of only @xmath28 at @xmath29 confidence , we expect that x - ray and optical positions so derived will agree to @xmath30 or better even before applying corrections that can be made by optically identifying serendipitous x - ray sources .",
    "it was possible to meaningfully check the  aspect solution using multiple serendipitous sources in only one case .",
    "the results are described below .",
    "the  image of  consists of a diffuse source with a diameter of @xmath31 that is coincident with the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "figure  [ image1 ] shows that the distribution of x - ray photons is consistent with the pattern of the inner spiral structure seen in the  image .",
    "after background subtraction , @xmath32 photons are detected in this region .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ image2 ] indicates that all of this emission is confined to energies below 1.5  kev .",
    "spectra in this region @xcite have strong balmer emission lines , indicating that the spiral structure is dominated by young stars and regions .",
    "since it is likely that the x - rays originate from processes specific to starbursts , such as o star winds , superbubbles , and perhaps old supernova remnants , we use a raymond - smith thermal plasma model to estimate the flux and luminosity of this source .",
    "as indicated in table  [ tbl1 ] , we find that for temperatures around @xmath33  k , the x - ray luminosity is @xmath34 ergs  s@xmath8 in the 0.22.4 kev band , or @xmath35 ergs  s@xmath8 in the 0.12.4 kev band .",
    "the absence of hard x - rays argues against a large contribution of x - ray binaries to this flux , although a few can be present .",
    "diffuse sources of similar luminosity and extent have been detected in the nucleus and bar of ngc  1672 and in other nearby starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the brightest pixel in the x - ray image falls on the center of the galaxy , it contain only three photons , and does not constitute strong evidence of an active nucleus , whether from ongoing seyfert activity or from the tail of the flare . both the softness of the source and the lack of a significant central peak lead us to believe that most of it is starburst emission .",
    "nevertheless , we derive a conservative upper limit to the flux of a nuclear x - ray source by assigning the central pixel and its immediate neighbors , a total of eight photons , to the upper limit .",
    "if modeled as a power law of photon index @xmath36 , this corresponds to less than @xmath37 ergs  s@xmath8 in the 0.22.4 kev band , or less than @xmath38 ergs  s@xmath8 from 0.12.4 kev .",
    "if instead we assume a blackbody of @xmath39  kev , similar to the spectrum of the  flare , then the upper limit is less than @xmath40 ergs  s@xmath8 in the 0.12.4 kev band .",
    "the original  error circle of this source contains a single galaxy that was studied optically by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of the three targets studied here ,  has the weakest x - ray detection .",
    "it is not clear whether the four photons detected by  from the vicinity of its nucleus in figure  [ image1 ] are related to the original flare , or even whether they are coming from the optical nucleus .",
    "however , since their coordinates coincide to within @xmath41 , we assume that the x - ray source represents a weak detection of the nucleus of .",
    "three additional point sources that are seen by  on the acis - s3 ccd can be used to verify the x - ray astrometry .",
    "figure  [ image3 ] , an @xmath42-band ccd image that was obtained on the mdm 2.4  m telescope on 1999 march 8 , shows the locations of the detected sources , all of which coincide with faint objects in the magnitude range 21.221.6 , and are possibly qsos or other types of agns . their x - ray and optical positions , listed in table  [ tbl2 ] , agree on average to within @xmath43 in each coordinate .",
    "thus , we have verified the x - ray astrometry and we do not make any further adjustments to it .",
    "the closest x - ray source to  is @xmath44 away , nominally too far from the  error circle ( @xmath45 radius of @xmath46 ) to be identified with the  flare .",
    "if by unfortunate coincidence this 12 photon source cxou j162501.6 + 755512 is actually the source of the  flare , then we should consider the possibility that it is a variable galactic object such as an am  her star .",
    "however , we have carefully examined the rass photons from , confirming the previously published source position .",
    "we accept the original optical identification of the host galaxy of the x - ray flare as most likely , and proceed to consider the implications of the weak `` detection '' of the same galaxy .",
    "the measured energies of the four `` nuclear '' photons range from 0.7 to 4.8 kev .",
    "this range would not be expected for a soft blackbody or diffuse thermal source .",
    "therefore , we treat this as a single point source and estimate its luminosity assuming a power - law spectrum of photon index @xmath47 .",
    "the result is @xmath48 ergs  s@xmath8 in the 0.22.4  kev band , or @xmath49 ergs  s@xmath8 from 0.12.4  kev .",
    "given the uncertainty about the existence or location of this source , it is perhaps safer to regard it as an upper limit to the persistent x - ray luminosity of .",
    "this observation extends the total amplitude of x - ray variability of  to a factor of @xmath50 , since its originally detected luminosity was @xmath51 ergs  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "is the only one of the three  targets that has a clear point x - ray source associated with its nucleus .",
    "the x - ray and optical positions differ by @xmath19 , which is not significant .",
    "the centering of the x - ray source on the optical nucleus of also tends to rule out the fainter companion galaxy rx  j1242.61119b as the source of flare ; their positions were not distinguished by  @xcite .",
    "the measured energies of the 18 x - ray photons range from 0.4 to 4.6  kev .",
    "this range would not be expected for a soft blackbody of @xmath39 kev , similar to the original flare spectrum . moreover ,",
    "an observation of  by _ xmm_-newton in 2001 june @xcite can be fitted by a power law of photon index @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we estimate the source luminosity assuming such a power law . the result is @xmath52 ergs  s@xmath8 in the 0.22.4  kev band , or @xmath53 ergs  s@xmath8 from 0.12.4  kev",
    "this detection extends the total amplitude of x - ray variability of  to a factor of @xmath54 , since its originally detected luminosity was @xmath55 ergs  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    ", the galaxy with the best - sampled historical x - ray light curve , shows a fading of the flare luminosity at a rate close to the predicted accretion rate @xmath56 ( komossa & greiner 1999 ) , which @xcite regard as strong evidence that its flare was a tidal disruption event .",
    "the -detected diffuse x - ray emission around the nucleus of  is comparable in luminosity to the lowest state measured in the final  observation in late 1996 . correcting the luminosity listed in table  [ tbl1 ] to the 0.12.4 kev band and to the @xmath22 km",
    "s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 used by @xcite , we find that the -measured flux can account for @xmath57 of the minimum flux measured by .",
    "considering the different band passes and spatial resolution of the two instruments , as well as the lack of constraints on the appropriate spectral model , we consider this fraction to be consistent with unity .",
    "figure  [ graph1 ] shows a history of the x - ray luminosity of from  @xcite and .",
    "luminosities in this figure assume a @xmath39  kev blackbody spectrum for the nuclear source , and have been adjusted to a common ( 0.12.4  kev ) energy band and @xmath21 km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 .",
    "note that the resolution of the starburst x - ray component by  allows a good fit to a @xmath0 decay plus a constant .",
    "taking the starburst component into account improves the fit of the measurements and upper limits to the @xmath0 line over the fits made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the nuclear flux is also consistent with such a decay , and by virtue of its sensitivity extends the total observered amplitude of the flare to a factor of @xmath58 , which is a larger range than has been seen in any agn .",
    "it is important to note that these data do not tightly constrain the _ value _ of the decay index , since the actual time of the tidal disruption event @xmath3 is unknown .",
    "rather , a decay index of @xmath59 is assumed and fitted to the highest flux point observed during the flare and all of the subsequent detections .",
    "an acceptable fit is found provided that @xmath60 , which is @xmath61 days before the peak of the luminosity seen by .",
    "if the rass observation did indeed catch the peak of the flare , it is quite constraining of @xmath3 , perhaps fortuitously so since the observation was only 4 days long .",
    "our estimate of @xmath3 differs by only about 10 days from that of @xcite , which is within their assumed margin of error .",
    "@xcite showed that in the case of a star that is spun up to near break - up , this delay is consistent with the expected time for bound material to return to a black hole of @xmath62 , which is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath63 derived by @xcite from the h@xmath64 emission - line velocities in the  spectrum .",
    "@xcite also argued that since the flare luminosity is much less than @xmath65 , it is likely that only a small fraction of a solar mass was accreted , perhaps from a brown dwarf or just the outer layers of a low - mass star .",
    "the integral of the luminosity in the @xmath66 decay from the presumed peak at @xmath67 to @xmath68 is @xmath69 ergs , with a smaller amount coming before the peak .",
    "this requires an accretion of only @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the efficiency of converting mass to energy .    even in the absence of other evidence for seyfert activity",
    ", the narrow emission - line ratios found in the nucleus of by  require excitation by a non - stellar ionizing continuum .",
    "@xcite argued that these lines are unlikely to have been excited by the x - ray flare , but indicate prior , ongoing activity . in an erratum to @xcite ,",
    "a revised nuclear h@xmath64 luminosity of @xmath72 ergs s@xmath8 was measured .",
    "this quantity can be used to predict the time - averaged soft x - ray luminosity of the nucleus using the correlation of 0.12.4  kev luminosity with h@xmath64 luminosity derived by @xcite from observations of low - luminosity agns .",
    "they find @xmath73 on average .",
    "the predicted soft x - ray luminosity of ngc 5905 is then @xmath74 ergs s@xmath8 , which is comparable to the  upper limit of @xmath75 ergs s@xmath8 on the nuclear luminosity in the 0.12.4  kev band .",
    "considering the scatter in this relation , we are unable to rule out the existence of a normal , low - luminosity agn in the nucleus of  that survived after the x - ray flare .",
    "given the huge amplitude of the flare , we favor a tidal disruption explanation for its origin even if there is also an underlying low - luminosity agn .",
    "deeper exposures with  will be able to test for a persistent agn , i.e. , by detecting a positive excess above the extrapolated @xmath66 decline shown in figure  [ graph1 ] .",
    "the present upper limit from a short observation is not even a factor of 2 above the extrapolation .",
    "was detected only once by , and we can not fit a power - law decay to it because there is no information about the time of origin @xmath3 of the flare .",
    "if we _ assume _ that the factor of @xmath76 observered x - ray decline follows a @xmath66 law , then the time of peak emission @xmath77 would have occurred only @xmath78 days before the rass observation in 1990 , which is fortuitous timing similar to the  discovery .",
    "( of course , it is the all - sky coverage of the rass that enabled it to detect these rare events ) .",
    "however , the rass observation itself lasted 8.5 days @xcite , during which time the light curve showed only random variability around a mean count rate .",
    "this constancy can be understood in the simplest decay scenario only if the rass observation was timed exactly to catch the flare at its peak , when it had stopped rising but had not yet entered a @xmath66 decline phase .",
    "alternatively , the constant  count rate may be interpreted as an eddington - limited phase in the flare , in which case @xmath79 implies @xmath80 .",
    "the duration of such a phase is @xmath81  yr @xcite , or @xmath82  yr ; under this interpretation the timing of the rass observation was not special .",
    "the total energy in the rass light curve alone is @xmath83 ergs .",
    "while this is less than that observed in many gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows , the long constant phase and soft x - ray spectrum are dissimilar to all well - observered grbs , and do not support such an identification .    the only other indication of whether the observed factor of 6000 x - ray decline in  can be a property of a persistent agn comes from the absence of optical activity in its  spectrum @xcite .",
    "an upper limit to the flux of a narrow h@xmath64 emission line of @xmath84 ergs @xmath85 s@xmath8 can be derived from that spectrum , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath86 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "narrow emission lines are more useful for this test than broad emission lines because they are powered by the average ionizing flux over decades , rather than over days for broad emission lines .",
    "the h@xmath64 upper limit is a factor of 90 less than the present @xmath49 ergs  s@xmath8 x - ray luminosity , compared to the @xcite average ratio @xmath87 , which would tend to argue that there is _ not _ an ordinary , persistent agn with such an x - ray luminosity in .",
    "additional , deeper x - ray observations during the coming years can clarify the nature of the low state of this galaxy nucleus .    similarly to the case of ,  was observed in a high state only once .",
    "however , the high state of  was observed in pointed mode 1.6  yr _ after _ a non - detection in the rass during 1990 december  1991 january @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are able to delimit the time of the presumed tidal disruption event to later than 1991.0 and earlier than 1992.7 . if the one  detection at @xmath55 ergs  s@xmath8 and the one  detection at @xmath88 ergs  s@xmath8 are forced to fit a @xmath66 law , then @xmath89 , which is consistent with the non - detection in the rass .",
    "a caveat is needed here .",
    "these luminosities were calculated assuming different spectra models ( soft blackbody for the rass _ vs. _ power - law for ) because the spectrum appears harder in the latter case .",
    "it is not necessary that the soft x - ray band contains the bulk of the bolometric luminosity at late times if the emission is no longer optically thick at low accretion rates .",
    "the theoretical @xmath66 decline applies to the _ accretion rate _ , whereas we may expect a departure of the _ x - ray flux _ from this power law as the emission spectrum broadens .",
    "if such an effect is operating , the x - rays underestimate the bolometric luminosity , and the inferred disruption time @xmath3 should be revised to an earlier date . as in the case of",
    ", it is not excluded that the flare from  was observed in an eddington - limited phase and that @xmath90 is therefore relatively small .",
    "as we did for the other objects , we can use the  spectrum of  to quantify and interpret the absence of agn emission lines .",
    "similarly to , we find that the upper limit to the flux of a narrow h@xmath64 emission line is @xmath84 ergs @xmath85 s@xmath8 , corresponding to @xmath91 ergs s@xmath8 . since this limit is a factor of 850 less than the present x - ray luminosity , it appears that a `` normal '' agn with this x - ray luminosity is not a persistent feature of  either .",
    "future observations with will be able to track the expected further decay of the x - ray source in  according to the tidal disruption scenario .",
    "observations of , , and  in 2001 and 2002 show that their x - ray fluxes are continuing to decline at a rate that is consistent with the predicted accretion rate as a function of time in the fall - back phase of a tidal disruption event .  and",
    "are observered to be factors of 1000 and 6000 fainter , respectively , than their peak luminosities detected in the rass . only  still has an identifiable nuclear x - ray source , whose luminosity is nevertheless a factor of 240 less than its peak in 1992 . since  and",
    "were confirmed to be inactive galaxies from the absence of broad or narrow emission lines , or non - stellar continuum in their  spectra , the most natural interpretation of their presently weak x - ray emission is the continuing decline following the tidal disruption of a star by an otherwise dormant central supermassive black hole .",
    "the relatively low peak luminosity and fluence of the x - ray flare in  is most simply interpreted as the accretion of only @xmath92 of stellar debris , while the short duration of the peak is consistent with @xmath93 .",
    "the much higher luminosities of the flares in  and  do not necessarily imply larger black hole masses for those objects , since a super - eddington infall rate onto a smaller black hole can last for of order a year and maintain a constant luminosity for that time .",
    "a longer peak duration would make it easier to understand why the rass caught all of these events at their maximum flux .",
    "@xcite argued from theory that the rate of tidal disruption in galaxy nuclei should actually increase with decreasing @xmath90 ; if so , this should be considered seriously as a selection effect .    in the case of",
    ", the  detection of weak , seyfert  2 emission lines in its nucleus raises additional uncertainty about whether its x - ray flare was the result of a tidal disruption or just exceptionally high - amplitude variability of its low - luminosity seyfert nucleus that is not yet explained .",
    "the ability of  to resolve the starburst source in  enabled a further order - of - magnitude decrease in the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus to be detected with respect to the faintest  measurement .",
    "in fact , there was no definite nuclear x - ray source to be seen in 2002 , and the extreme amplitude of the decline leads us to favor the tidal disruption interpretation of the flare even if a low - luminosity agn was present previously .",
    "it is likely that a prior agn accretion disk survived the tidal disruption event ; deeper exposures with  should be able to detect its continuing x - ray luminosity as an excess above the extrapolated @xmath66 decay .",
    "occasional reobservation of these objects is needed , if only to allow the tidal disruption hypothesis to be falsified by detecting renewed activity .",
    "while some of the tidal debris should itself spread into a thin accretion disk on the viscous time - scale , weak emission from this eventual agn fuel source is not expected to dominate for several thousand years @xcite . in the likely event that all three x - ray sources studied here continue to decline ,",
    "deeper  observations are required to track their luminosities and provide further observational constraints on the decay curve that the theory of the fall - back phase predicts .",
