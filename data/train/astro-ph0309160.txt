    "measurements of magnetic fields in the environment of star forming regions are mostly carried out with observations of zeeman splitting ( crutcher 1999 ) , the polarimetry of dust continuum ( dotson et al .",
    "2000 ; lai et al .  2001 , 2002 ) , and the polarimetry of co emission ( girart et al .  1999 ; lai et al .",
    "the zeeman observations only give the field _ strength _ along the line of sight , and the polarimetry of dust continuum and co emission yield the field _ direction _ in the plane of sky . as a result",
    ", these observations do not determine the full strength and orientation of the magnetic fields in 3-d . to characterize the magnetic field environment",
    ", we need to measure directly the magnetic field strength in the plane of sky @xmath6 . without direct measurement of the full field strengths ,",
    "the role magnetic fields play in star formation can only be assessed using indirect estimates of @xmath6 ( the chandrasekhar - fermi method as used by lai et al .",
    "2001 ) and some statistical arguments ( crutcher 1999 ) .",
    "houde et al .  ( 2002 ) proposed an interesting new approach to probe the orientation of magnetic fields .",
    "houde et al .  ( 2000a , b )",
    "show that in weakly ionized plasma , even under weak fields ( @xmath7 g ) , the cyclotron interaction between the ions and the field can reduce the linewidth and suppress the high velocity wings in the ion spectra when compared to coexistent neutral spectra .",
    "their hcn and hco@xmath2 observations with the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) show evidence of these predicted features . because the ion - to - neutral linewidth ratio depends largely on the inclination angle of the magnetic fields ( no cyclotron interaction along the field lines ) ,",
    "the full strength and orientation of magnetic fields can be obtained by combining the observations of zeeman splitting , polarimetry of dust continuum and/or co emission , and the ion - to - neutral linewidth ratio .",
    "houde et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have constructed the 3-d field structure of m17 using this method .",
    "however , it is difficult to interpret the differences in the velocity dispersions of the ion / neutral spectra unambiguously as being caused by the cyclotron interaction , if the beam is large enough to include the spectral line emissions from physically and chemically different components .",
    "the intrinsic difference between the velocity structure of the ions and neutrals will also contribute to the ion - to - neutral linewidth ratio .",
    "for example , if a velocity gradient exists in a large region with hcn , but hco@xmath2 only coexists with hcn in a small part of this region , the hcn linewidth is naturally larger than the hco@xmath2 linewidth . therefore , it is important to obtain high spatial resolution spectral line maps to resolve the regions with widely different physical and chemical characteristics .    in this paper , we present the comparison between h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 spectra in dr21(oh ) observed with the millimeter array of the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) .",
    "dr21(oh ) is an excellent object to study the magnetic field structure , because it is in the early stage of massive star formation .",
    "dr21(oh ) is one of the few sources with measured average line - of - sight magnetic field strength from cn zeeman detections ( crutcher et al .",
    "1999 ) and field directions in the plane of sky mapped with bima using both dust and co polarimetry ( lai et al .  2003 ) . deriving the full strength and",
    "3-d structure requires knowledge of the inclination angle of the magnetic field to the line of sight , which can be obtained by measuring the ion - to - neutral linewidth ratio .",
    "the observations were made with the ovro millimeter array at 3 mm in the compact , low , and high resolution array configurations between october 2002 and may 2003 .",
    "we obtained simultaneously spectral line images of hcn & hco@xmath2 and h@xmath1cn & h@xmath1co@xmath2 ; @xmath1cs and n@xmath8h@xmath2 were observed in the opposite sidebands .",
    "the synthesized beam is 6.4@xmath96.9  for natural weighting and spectral resolutions are 0.434 . among these images ,",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath2 spectra show features of optically thick emission with strong self - absorption ; n@xmath8h@xmath2 has a very different spatial distribution compared to other species ; h@xmath1cn , h@xmath1co@xmath2 , and @xmath1cs have a similar spatial distribution , but @xmath1cs has a different velocity structure from the other two .",
    "therefore , h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 are the only neutral / ion pair that can be used to examine the cyclotron effect in our data .",
    "figure 1 shows the 3 mm continuum and the integrated flux of h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 .",
    "the two compact cores in dr21(oh ) , mm1 and mm2 , are resolved .",
    "h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 both trace the dense cores very well .",
    "h@xmath1co@xmath2 is slightly more extended than h@xmath1cn , which is probably due to the lower critical density of h@xmath1co@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 seem to occupy the same volume .",
    "figure 2 shows the normalized h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 spectra overlaid on their flux ratio map .",
    "note that h@xmath1cn has three hyperfine lines with intensity ratios of 1:5:3 for the optically thin case .",
    "the spectra show that dr21(oh ) contains two dominant velocity components  one at @xmath10  and the other at @xmath11 , which are likely to be associated with mm1 and mm2 , respectively . at the positions between mm1 and mm2 , the spectra are more complex and",
    "may contain an absorption feature at @xmath122.5 .",
    "overall , the spectra of h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 trace each other well , which is strong evidence for the coexistence of h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 , as also suggested by their spatial intensity correlation .",
    "a difference in the ion / neutral linewidth can arise in some cases from chemical inhomogeniety , especially , if multiple velocity features are present . in figure 2",
    "we show the distribution of the h@xmath1cn - to - h@xmath1co@xmath2 flux ratio ( in greyscale ) which is a measure of the chemical differentiation in the core .",
    "we can safely discard the effects of chemical differentiation by excluding regions where the flux ratio changes appreciably over the small spatial scale sizes of the ovro beam .",
    "however , chemical differentiation alone will not always cause linewidth differences .",
    "the velocity structure of the region also needs to be considered .",
    "for example , if the velocity structure is uniform across the cores such that the shape and the central velocity of the spectra stay the same , any local variation in the ion - to - neutral flux ratio will result in a weighting factor that affects only the line intensities , not the ion - to - neutral linewidth ratios for the whole core . however , in dr21(oh ) at least two velocity components are detected and therefore , it is critical to isolate the regions with different dynamics when interpreting the ion - to - neutral linewidth ratio as the cyclotron effect .",
    "we see a large variation in their flux ratio ( by factors of 0.5 to 4 ) over the entire region , but it appears to be smooth except near the southwest parts of the core . in the eastern parts of the core",
    "the variation in the flux ratio is small , and the fully resolved velocity structure is dominated by a single feature .",
    "thus , in this region of dr21(oh ) , we are able to minimize any contribution to the ion / neutral linewidth differences arising from chemical inhomogeneity . in our analysis",
    "we do not include the southwest region where rapid and significant variation of ion - to - neutral flux ratio is observed .",
    "furthermore , the ion / neutral spectra in the southwest region have low s / n .    in the eastern part of mm1 where the @xmath55  component dominates and the spectral line shapes are better defined",
    ", we can see that h@xmath1co@xmath2 is slightly narrower than h@xmath1cn . to eliminate the complication of the h@xmath1cn hyperfine lines , we simulate h@xmath1cn spectra with all three hyperfine lines using the h@xmath1co@xmath2 as a ` template ' . for the case of a single velocity component ,",
    "if the linewidth of h@xmath1cn is smaller than half of the velocity separations between hyperfine lines , the difference spectrum between the observed h@xmath1cn and that simulated from h@xmath1co@xmath2 is largely free from the confusion caused by the hyperfine components and thus is a useful measure of the cyclotron interaction . if indeed h@xmath1cn has larger linewidths than h@xmath1co@xmath2 , the difference spectra will have two positive peaks near the wings of the line profile as demonstrated in figure 2d .",
    "as the line shapes of h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 are approximately gaussians , the integration of the difference spectra over the extent of the main hyperfine component gives a measure of the difference of the dispersions in the spectra .",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the normalized h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 spectra and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the dispersions of h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 , respectively . figure 3a shows the map of @xmath18 which is calculated by integrating the difference spectra over the @xmath19  component ( @xmath20 to @xmath21 ) .",
    "these @xmath18 estimated using eq(1 ) are in good agreement ( within 10% ) with those obtained by fitting gaussians to the observed h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 line profiles at ( + 10 , + 5 ) . the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath18 is presented in figure 3b .",
    "we use @xmath18 and @xmath17 measured from h@xmath1co@xmath2 spectra to derive @xmath22 in figure 3c .",
    "it is evident from the results shown in figure 3 that in the eastern side of mm1 the ion linewidth is smaller than the neutral linewidth .",
    "we do not present similar analysis for the @xmath23  component , because of the low s / n of @xmath18 .",
    "the interferometer observations with ovro have the advantage to resolve the velocity and chemical structures in the dr21(oh ) core with high spatial resolution . in the eastern parts of dr21(oh ) our observations show that h@xmath1cn and h@xmath1co@xmath2 coexist over  15 @xmath910  in a single velocity feature and confirm that the ion line is indeed narrower than the neutral line .",
    "we use the ion - to - neutral linewidth ratio @xmath22 shown in figure 3c to infer the inclination angle of the magnetic field to the line of sight ( @xmath24 ) according to equation ( 11 ) of houde et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . to derive the value of ( @xmath24 ) using the ion / neutral linwidth ratio we require knowledge of the gas motions within the core .",
    "houde et al .",
    "consider the cases with neutral flow collimation widths , @xmath25 , ( @xmath26  means no collimation as in a purely turbulent case ) .",
    "for a given value of @xmath22 a range of values for @xmath24 are possible depending on the values for flow collimation widths ( see figure 4 in houde et al . ) . for example the average ion - to - neutral linewidth ratio , @xmath22 of 0.82 will correspond to an inclination angle @xmath24 = 76 , 60and 36   for @xmath25=20 , 45and 90   respectively .",
    "the dependence of the estimates for @xmath24 on @xmath25 is less critical for @xmath27 90 , a case when turbluent motions dominate over collimated flows .",
    "although mm1 in dr21(oh ) does power high velocity co outflows ( lai et al .",
    "2003 ) , there is no evidence that the spectra of ions and neutrals observed at the rest velocity of the cores are contaminated by collimated flows .",
    "therefore , to derive the magnetic field inclination , we have ignored collimated flows and we assume the gas is fully turbulent ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the inclination angle @xmath24 ranges from 30   in the northern part of mm1 to 42  in the south , and the uncertainty in @xmath24 is @xmath0 48 .",
    "the variation in @xmath24 is small ( 12 ) and is comparable to the variation of the overlaid @xmath6 vectors derived from the dust polarization ( black ) and co polarization ( white ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field directions seem to be approximately uniform across the mm1 region . the average line - of - sight magnetic field strength in mm1 @xmath0 @xmath50.36@xmath30.10 mg as measured by cn zeeman observations ( crutcher et al .  1999 ) . with the average @xmath28 ,",
    "the field strength in the plane of sky ( @xmath6 ) is 0.25@xmath30.07 mg , and the full magnetic field strength is @xmath290.12 mg .",
    "the direction of the field is out of the plane of the sky towards the observer at an angle of 36to the line of sight , and its projection on the sky is at a position angle @xmath30 .",
    "lai et al .  ( 2003 ) estimate @xmath310.9 mg for mm1 from the observed dispersion in the co polarization position angles using the chandrasekhar - fermi formula .",
    "this value is a factor of 3 larger than what is derived from the cyclotron interaction data presented here",
    ". this discrepancy could be partly due to the low values for the dispersion caused by the smoothing of polarization by the finite beam size of the bima observations .",
    "also , the ` calibration factor ' of the chandrasekhar - fermi formula ( 0.5 ) used by lai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is an average value of clouds in numerical simulations ( ostriker , gammie , & stone 2001 ) , which may not be a proper value dr21(oh ) .    with the knowledge of the full magnetic field strength",
    ", we can evaluate the role that magnetic fields play for star formation in mm1 .",
    "first , we can calculate the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio from @xmath32 in units of the critical mass - to - flux ratio ( crutcher 1999 ) , where @xmath33 is the column density in @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the field strength in @xmath36 g . with @xmath37 @xmath34 and b=0.44 mg , @xmath384.5 .",
    "therefore , mm1 is clearly magnetically supercritical .",
    "however , turbulence seems to provide dominant support .",
    "the h@xmath1co@xmath2 linewidth ( @xmath0 2.2 ) is much larger than its thermal linewidth for @xmath39=50 k ( 0.3 ) , indicating strong turbulence in dr21(oh ) .",
    "the relative importance of magnetic , thermal , and turbulent support can be evaluated by comparing their energy to the gravitational energy .",
    "we find that in mm1 the magnetic - to - gravitational energy ratio is 0.05 , the thermal - to - gravitational energy ratio is 0.16 , and the turbulent - to - gravitational energy ratio is 0.66 .",
    "therefore , turbulence provides the dominant support in mm1 .",
    "although our conclusion on the status of mm1 is similar to what has been suggested by crutcher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with statistical argument for the full magnetic field strength , our results exclude the possiblity of the magnetic field dominance which may be true only if the field orientation in 3-d is very close to the plane of the sky .",
