    "the picture was dramatically improved this year , as results were announced first in summer 99 from the ground - based toco experiment in chile @xcite , then in november 1999 from the north american balloon test flight of boomerang @xcite , then in april 2000 from the first cmb long duration balloon ( ldb ) flight , of boomerang @xcite , followed in may 2000 from the night flight of maxima @xcite .",

    "the lower panel shows the optimally combined power spectra of boomerang+maxima+dmr ( squares ) and contrasts it with that for boomerang+maxima+prior - cmb ( circles ) , showing that including the prior experiments does not make a large difference to the results .",

    "free - streaming along our ( linearly perturbed ) past light cone leaves the pattern largely unaffected , except that temporal evolution in the gravitational potential wells as the photons propagate through them leaves a further @xmath25 imprint , called the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",

    "a secondary anisotropy not associated with the cmb photons is stellar and accretion disk radiation reprocessed by dust into the infrared and redshifted into the submm , leading to a wien tail distortion of the cmb blackbody .",

    "boomerang carried a 1.2 m telescope with 16 bolometers cooled to 0.3k in the focal plane aloft from mcmurdo bay in antarctica in late december 1998 , circled the pole for 10.6 days and landed just 50 km from the launch site , only slightly damaged . in @xcite , maps at 90 , 150 and 220 ghz showed the same spatial features and the intensities were shown to fall precisely on the cmb blackbody curve .",

    "fundamental to the first step is the extraction of the sky signal from the noise , using the only information we have , the pointing matrix mapping a bit in time onto a pixel position on the sky .",
    "there is generally another step in between ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , namely separating the multifrequency spatial maps into the physical components on the sky : the primary cmb , the thermal and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effects , the dust , synchrotron and bremsstrahlung galactic signals , the extragalactic radio and submillimetre sources .",
    "the strong agreement among the boomerang maps indicates that to first order we can ignore this step , but it has to be taken into account as the precision increases .",

    "higher order ( concentration ) statistics ( 3,4-point functions , ) tell us of non - gaussian aspects , necessarily expected from the galactic foreground and extragalactic source signals , but possible even in the early universe fluctuations .",
    "for example , though non - gaussianity occurs only in the more baroque inflation models of quantum noise , it is a necessary outcome of defect - driven models of structure formation .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -1.0 truecm      for this paper , we adopt the restricted set of 7 cosmological parameters used in @xcite . among these , we have 2 characterizing the early universe primordial power spectrum of gravitational potential fluctuations @xmath39 , one giving the overall power spectrum amplitude @xmath40 , and one defining the shape , a spectral tilt @xmath41 , at some ( comoving ) normalization wavenumber @xmath42 .",
    "we really need another 2 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , associated with the gravitational wave component . in inflation , the amplitude ratio is related to @xmath45 to lowest order , with @xmath46 corrections at higher order , @xcite .",
    "there are also useful limiting cases for the @xmath47 relation .",
    "however , as one allows the baroqueness of the inflation models to increase , one can entertain essentially any power spectrum ( fully @xmath48-dependent @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) if one is artful enough in designing inflaton potential surfaces .",
    "as well , one can have more types of modes present , scalar isocurvature modes ( @xmath51 ) in addition to , or in place of , the scalar curvature modes ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , our philosophy is consider minimal models first , then see how progressive relaxation of the constraints on the inflation models , at the expense of increasing baroqueness , causes the parameter errors to open up . for example , with cobe - dmr and boomerang , we can probe the gw contribution , but the data are not powerful enough to determine much .",
    "planck can in principle probe the gravity wave contribution reasonably well .",
    "we use another 2 parameters to characterize the transport of the radiation through the era of photon decoupling , which is sensitive to the physical density of the various species of particles present then , @xmath53 .",
    "we really need 4 : @xmath54 for the baryons , @xmath55 for the cold dark matter , @xmath56 for the hot dark matter ( massive but light neutrinos ) , and @xmath57 for the relativistic particles present at that time ( photons , very light neutrinos , and possibly weakly interacting products of late time particle decays ) . for simplicity ,",

    "nonetheless , significant dark energy is apparently required .",
    "note that the simplest interpretation of the superkamiokande data on atmospheric @xmath68 is that @xmath69 , about the energy density of stars in the universe , which implies a cosmologically negligible effect .",
    "degeneracy between @xmath68 and @xmath70 could lead to the cosmologically very interesting @xmath71 , although the coincidence of closely related energy densities for baryons , cdm , hdm and dark energy required would be amazing .",

    "we can also forecast dramatically improved precision with further analysis of boomerang and maxima , other future ldbs , map and planck . because there are correlations among the physical variables we wish to determine , including a number of near - degeneracies beyond that for @xmath18@xmath61 @xcite , it is useful to disentangle them , by making combinations which diagonalize the error correlation matrix , `` parameter eigenmodes '' @xcite .",

    "if 4 of the 6 150 ghz channels are used and the region is doubled in size , we predict 4/9 could be determined to @xmath99 accuracy . and if the optimistic case for all the proposed ldbs is assumed , 6/9 parameter combinations could be determined to @xmath99 accuracy , 2/9 to @xmath100 accuracy .",
