    "the anisotropy field in the 2-dimensional distribution of iras sources on angular scales of @xmath8 was recently used to derive a characteristic length scale of about @xmath9mpc ( fabbri & natale 1993 ; the hubble constant @xmath10is here @xmath11 km s@xmath12mpc@xmath12 ) , significantly larger than the dipole - dominating scale ( villumsen & strauss 1987 ; clowes et al .",
    "1987 ) and comparable to the distance @xmath13 mpc at which the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xmath5 becomes negative ( guzzo et al .",
    "1991 ; see also davis & peebles 1983 ) .",
    "torres et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have shown that the fourier transform of @xmath5 , suitably modeled to reproduce the data of guzzo et al .",
    ", should induce a peak in the spectral function @xmath14of the inhomogeneities at a wavelength @xmath15 ; further , they find that best fitting on cobe data , involving the angular correlation function of the cosmic background radiation , provides @xmath16 @xmath17 mpc .",
    "we are thereby lead to suspect that the characteristic length in iras may be close to a peak of @xmath3 , although not necessarily to its absolute maximum .",
    "this interpretation , even in its weakest form , seems to be not consistent with several works inferring @xmath3 from the 3-dimensional distributions of visible and ir galaxies and clusters ( vogeley et al .",
    "1992 ; fisher et al . 1993 ; einasto et al . 1993",
    "; jing & valdarnini , 1993 ) . these works , based on fourier transforms of redshift - space distributions , provided spectra",
    "which , although not completely consistent with each other , steadily increase up to or beyond @xmath18 mpc : when some peak is detected , it is located at large wavelengths , in the range @xmath19 mpc . however , bahcall et al .",
    "( 1993 ) argue that large - scale velocities induced by the inhomogeneity field itself , not properly taken into account in the above works , may lead to largely overestimate the large - scale portion of the spectrum in real ( rather than redshift ) space .",
    "corrections are strongly model dependent , and for some of the cdm models considered by bahcall et al .",
    "they shift the peak wavelengths in the iras and cfa spectra down to @xmath20 mpc .",
    "is is thereby important in our view to exploit alternative techniques that are not affected by the problem of large scale velocities .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the question of the significance and reliability of the preferred scale that we identified in version i of the iras point source catalog .",
    "we use a larger sample including 12511 sources derived from version ii of the catalog , and we perform three statistical tests based on finite - size bins . these include the shapes of the functions ( i ) @xmath21 , the rms fluctuation in the source number density vs. angular scale @xmath22 in the range @xmath23 , ( ii ) @xmath24 , the autocorrelation function of the number density at@xmath25 , and ( iii ) @xmath26 , the number of local maxima in the source distribution vs. gaussian beam dispersion @xmath27(in the range @xmath28 ) and peak - height threshold @xmath29 .",
    "the experimental data are tested against a large number ( about 2000 ) of theoretical models .",
    "first we model the inhomogeneity field by isotropically stochastic perturbations endowed with a single wavelength @xmath30 , and search for the best values of @xmath30 , the cosmological density parameter @xmath31 , and the product @xmath32 ( the biasing factor of iras sources times the local velocity ) . although the present sample allows us detecting some dependency of @xmath33 on the chosen angular range ( in particular using the statistics on @xmath34 ) , nevertheless we can identify a preferred range around @xmath35mpc , irrespective of @xmath31 which can not be determined by the present tests .",
    "we then examine continuous spectra modeling both hot and cold matter with the usual requirement that@xmath36 at large wavelengths .",
    "we find that the hdm model in the @xmath37 cosmology gives excellent fits for all of our tests , except for one data point of @xmath38 at the largest scale @xmath39 .",
    "the hdm peak wavelength @xmath40 is only slightly larger than @xmath41found for single - scale models .",
    "individual tests can give best values as high as @xmath42 mpc with large error bars , but two joint tests combining the peak number data with rms fluctuation and correlation function data , respectively , give @xmath43 mpc and @xmath44 mpc .",
    "although we can not derive stringent limits on @xmath32 from individual hdm tests , when we require to simultaneously satisfy all of our tests we get a preferred value of @xmath45 km / s ( in close agreement with results that we find from single - scale models for @xmath37 ) .",
    "basically the same picture arises for other sharply - peaked spectral forms , for which the only important parameter is the location @xmath46 of the peak of@xmath47 .",
    "thus similar results for @xmath48are found for simple two - power spectra with slopes around @xmath49 at large @xmath50 .",
    "the investigation of cdm models on the other hand provides a quite different picture . for individual tests we find best - fit values of the shape parameter @xmath51 in one of the ranges @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "low - density models are favoured by several studies ( e.g. , efstathiou et al .",
    "now for @xmath54 the peak wavelength is @xmath55 mpc ; in fact , single - scale models are quite unable to represent so broad spectra as those implied by cdm models",
    ". however , the quality of cdm fits is less satisfactory than for hdm models , with the exception of the peak number statistics .",
    "in addition , no range of @xmath51 is completely satisfactory for all of our tests ; this latter fact recalls the results of scharf and lahav ( 1993 ) .",
    "it is well known that pure cdm models do not generally provide excellent fits to available data , a fact which motivates studies involving mixed matter ( davis et al .",
    "1992 , taylor & rowan - roinson 1992 ) or a cosmological constant ( efstathiou et al .",
    "however , the comparison of hdm and cdm fits in our work ( sect .",
    "4 ) is rather impressive .",
    "the spectral window functions that can be suitably defined for @xmath21 and @xmath24 show that such tests weight small scales less than other 2-dimensional tests from other authors ( in particular , scharf and lahav 1993 ) .",
    "this provides support to the idea that the preferred scale arising from sharply peaked spectra should correspond to something of physical .",
    "it is also clear that such a feature should be regarded as generated by the behaviour of @xmath5 around @xmath56 mpc measured by guzzo et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . since we do not directly construct an explicit spectral form from data",
    ", we do not claim that our tests on the distribution of iras sources necessarily imply an absolute maximum of @xmath14at scale @xmath46 , nor can we claim that hdm models satisfy the bulk of available astronomical data .",
    "however , our results make us believe that the shape of @xmath3 below @xmath18 mpc should not be so simple and featureless as generally believed , and that a positive slope up to or beyond @xmath57 mpc is probably incorrect .",
    "according to recent measurements of the angular correlation function in the apm survey the spectrum rises above a power law around @xmath58 mpc and seems to be peaked at @xmath18 mpc ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 ) , a scale smaller than declared by most authors on the basis of redshift surveys . in our view",
    "the problem of the detailed shape of @xmath3 is not so clearly solved and deserves further investigations .",
    "our models assume that the large - scale inhomogeneities are described by a isotropic , gaussian field of perturbations .",
    "the theory of source - count anisotropies has been developed ( fabbri 1988 , 1992 ) for a friedmann background with an arbitrary density parameter @xmath31 , perturbed by a cosmic density - wave spectrum @xmath3 such that    @xmath59    here the dimensionless wavenumber @xmath50 is connected to the physical wavelength by @xmath60 with @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "all the quantities that will be evaluated theoretically are derived from the squared coefficients of a harmonic expansion of the source - count anisotropy field @xmath64 .",
    "more precisely , we consider the expectation values @xmath65 where we sum up the cosmic - structure contribution@xmath66 given by @xmath67 and the noise term @xmath68 originated by discrete sources @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ cosmical ] ) @xmath70 denotes the sign of space curvature and the functions @xmath71 are suitable coefficients introduced by fabbri ( 1988 ) .",
    "we could also define window functions @xmath72 as in scharf and lahav ( 1993 ) by setting @xmath73 , with @xmath74the biasing factor of iras sources .",
    "the analysis of @xmath71 ( fabbri 1992 ) shows that the source properties affect the calculation through the biasing factor , the luminosity function , the number evolution factor and , to a very small extent , the spectral index",
    ". we shall provide explicit results for the exponential - logarithmic luminosity function of saunders et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , which best fits data with a number evolution factor @xmath75 . however , using the double - power functions of lawrence et al .",
    "( 1986 ) or villumsen and strauss ( 1987 ) does not change the conclusions of sect .",
    "4 ( adopting no source - number evolution of course , since they were obtained with this assumption ) . since in any case",
    "the assumed source distribution extends farther than probed in redshift surveys ( strauss et al .",
    "1990 ) , we checked the influence of a cutoff placed at some @xmath76 .",
    "figure 1 displays some typical results for @xmath77 , showing that we get no significant differences provided @xmath78 . a sharp cutoff at redshifts",
    "@xmath79 would decrease the amplitude of high order harmonics relative to low order ones .",
    "thus we just assume that sources still exist at a distance ( along the light cone ) equal to roughly three times the median depth of psc .",
    "we do not regard this as an onerous requirement : in practice we only assume that the median depth of the catalog is determined by the source luminosity function and the lower flux limit .",
    "the global properties of the universe are involved through @xmath31 .",
    "further , it was shown that , because of the presence of the discrete source term in eq .",
    "( [ al ] ) , the shape of the harmonic spectrum of anisotropies depends both on the shape of @xmath3 and on the product @xmath32 , with @xmath80the local velocity with respect to the cosmic background radiation .",
    "since @xmath80is generated by the perturbation field itself , it is also a measure of the absolute normalization of @xmath3 .",
    "( this implies that the shape of @xmath77 vs. @xmath81should be sufficient to fix its own normalization . )",
    "however , @xmath82 may be affected by nonlinear disturbances . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute normalization of @xmath77 is affected by high redshift sources more than the shape of the harmonic spectrum ( fabbri 1988 ) , and it might introduce a systematic error on the normalization of @xmath3 .",
    "we thereby prefer to fit @xmath83and the normalization factor of @xmath3 as two independent parameters .",
    "we then check a posteriori whether we obtain consistent results for @xmath84 , the biased fluctuation in @xmath85mpc spheres , computed from these two parameters when they are both available . for the peak number test",
    ", only the first method ( i.e. , derivation from @xmath32 ) can be used .    as to the shape of @xmath3",
    ", here we consider both single - scale models and continuous spectra .",
    "for the reasons outlined above , single - scale models only depend on three important parameters , i.e. @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for a full investigation of their influence we generated a regularly spaced lattice of 900 models for the adopted optimal",
    "set of source parameters [ i.e. , using the luminosity function of saunders et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and a mean spectral index of @xmath86 ; including also the luminosity functions of lawrence et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and villumsen and strauss ( 1987 ) , we investigated about 1500 single - scale models .",
    "continuous spectra , which were investigated only in conjunction with the exponential - logarithmic luminosity function , were modeled by simple analytic forms for hot and cold matter .",

    "the peak wavelength is given by @xmath89 ^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the number of models computed with the spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ hot ] ) was about 200 , and we limited ourselves to the critical density cosmology .",
    "we also considered about 200 models with power - law behaviours at large @xmath50 .",
    "we analyzed about 200 cdm models with @xmath90 ^{-2},\\ ] ] where @xmath91 . in this case",
    "the relevant parameter is @xmath51 , that we let vary in the range @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding peak wavelength is given by @xmath93 mpc .",
    "all of the above continuous spectra are so adjusted as to reproduce the standard harrison - zeldovich slope at large scales and exhibit a maximum . for",
    "sharply peaked spectra , which include hdm ( but not cdm ) models , only the location of this maximum is really important .",
    "thus the small - scale behaviour in eq .",
    "( [ hot ] ) , theoretically predicted by simple modeling of dissipative processes in hot matter , can be easily changed without affecting our conclusions .",
    "( this was tested investigating the sharply - peaked two - power spectra . ) although one can argue that eq .",
    "( [ hot ] ) can not reproduce such astronomical data as the galaxy correlation function on scales of tens of megaparsec ( see e.g. guzzo et al .",
    "1991 ) , it is the simplest one can imagine and turns out to pass our tests quite well .",
    "also , for the best fitted parameters arising from the tests it gives reasonable values of @xmath94 .",
    "for each model we calculated 300 harmonic amplitudes , in order to provide reliable results down to small angular scales .",
    "we then derived both the squared fluctuation in the source number per unit solid angle ( for two - beam experiments ) and the angular correlation function smeared over finite beamwidths , which are respectively given by the equations @xmath95\\ ] ] and @xmath96 with @xmath97 the angular separation of beam centers ( beamthrow ) , @xmath98 the effective beamwidth , and @xmath99 the legendre polynomials .",
    "the coefficients @xmath100 are affected by the beam angular response and are well known for both gaussian and sharp - edge beams . in this paper",
    "any theoretical results based on eqs . ( [ rms ] ) and ( [ c ] ) refer to sharp - edge circular beams , for which @xmath27denotes the angular diameter .",
    "equation ( [ rms ] ) was used to evaluate @xmath101 with @xmath102 , while using ( [ c ] ) @xmath27is kept fixed . in both cases we checked that calculations are accurate down to @xmath103 , while at @xmath104 we would need more harmonic amplitudes .",
    "although the similarity of eqs . ( [ rms ] ) and ( [ c ] ) seems to imply that these two tests are quite equivalent , this is not the case . in the limiting case @xmath105 ,",
    "the discrete - noise terms give a vanishing contribution to @xmath24 because @xmath106 for @xmath107 , and for the reasons explained in fabbri ( 1992 ) any dependence on the parameter @xmath32 disappears . for finite values of @xmath108",
    "this is no more strictly true , but the test based on the shape of @xmath109 remains quite insensitive to @xmath32 .    a question which is very important for the main issue of our paper is , how length scales are weighted in eqs . ( [ rms ] ) and ( [ c ] ) . since @xmath110 and @xmath24 depend linearly on @xmath77 , which in its turn is a linear function of @xmath3 , it is possible to define two window functions @xmath111 and @xmath112such that the cosmic - structure contributions to the above quantities are expressed as @xmath113 .",

    "( for consistency with beamwidths used in our tests , we set @xmath102 and @xmath118 , respectively , for such calculations . )",
    "it appears that small scales are weighted in two of our tests less than in the work of scharf and lahav ( 1993 ) using the 2-jy iras survey .",
    "this is due to the statistical bias of the iras _ redshift _ survey including 2650 objects .",
    "generally speaking , we expect a large , flux - limited sample to include more far - away sources than a redshift survey .",
    "both @xmath116 and @xmath119 increase monotonically with wavelength .",
    "the actual contribution of a length scale to the signal depends on the spectrum and can be estimated as @xmath120 .",
    "for instance , for rms fluctuations in the angular range @xmath121 the signals reach their maxima at @xmath122 mpc for a hdm spectrum with @xmath123 mpc , and at @xmath124 mpc for a cdm spectrum with @xmath125 .",
    "for the same models , the signals fall to 10% of their maxima at @xmath126 mpc , i.e. around the boundary of the linear region , and decrease very rapidly at smaller scales .",
    "thus nonlinear disturbances are small .",
    "we further consider the number of local maxima in the density of sources over the sky .",
    "we define @xmath26 as the number of peaks higher than a threshold @xmath29 , counted in the source distribution after smoothing by a gaussian beam with dispersion @xmath127 . following bond and efsthatiou ( 1987 )",
    "we take the threshold height @xmath128 in units of @xmath129 .",

    "inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ peak]-[gamma ] ) shows a highly non - linear dependence on @xmath77 , so that it is not possible to define a window function .",
    "however , the strong weight given to higher order harmonics in eqs .",
    "( [ teta ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) proves that perturbations with small @xmath135must have a strong bearing on the statistics for small beamwidths , so that we expect to be able to provide a lower limit to a dominating scale by this test .",
    "taking advantage of 300 harmonic amplitudes allowed us to evaluate@xmath136 accurately down to @xmath137 .",
    "since now @xmath138denotes a beam dispersion rather than a diameter , the investigation of small scales is limited somewhat more strongly than for other quantities .",
    "we used a galaxy sample based on the iras point source catalog , version ii , including sources at 60 @xmath0 m in the flux interval 0.6 - 20 jy .",
    "the galaxies were selected basically using the same criteria as in strauss et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , but we also set the lower flux limit to 0.6 jy , the completeness limit of the iras survey ( yahil et al .",
    "1986 ) , and extended the region of avoidance around the galactic plane to @xmath139 . to reduce the residual contamination we also excluded other sky regions after source binning ; see below .",
    "this sample differs from the one of fabbri and natale ( 1993 ) , not only for the higher number of sources but also for a different calibration in version ii of the catalog , leading to smaller spectral indexes of the sources .",
    "the average spectral index calculated from fluxes at 60 and 25 @xmath140 m is @xmath141 , and the one from fluxes at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m is @xmath142 . for the theoretical modelling in sect .",
    "2 we adopted the mean value @xmath143 , but the results are quite insensitive to this choice .    sources were collected in bins spanning equal intervals @xmath144 ( i.e. , in galactic longitude ) and @xmath145 ( in the sine of galactic latitude ) .",
    "we considered three resolution levels leading to three maps with 128@xmath14664 , 256@xmath146128 and 512@xmath146256 bins , respectively , over the entire celestial sphere .",
    "an effective angular diameter @xmath147 such that @xmath148 @xmath149 can be defined for the bins . for the above resolution levels we have @xmath150 ,",
    "@xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively . for the purpose of our analysis",
    "clean bins with a vanishing number of sources are quite significant , but we must exclude regions contaminated by galactic emission or not sufficiently observed during the survey . hence to each source map we applied a mask excluding bins which are ( i ) not observed at least twice in the survey , or ( ii ) contained within @xmath139 around the galactic plane , or ( iii ) confused due to large number of sources ( such as the orion complex , taurus and ophiuchus star forming regions , the large and small magellanic clouds ) , or ( iv ) contaminated by cirrus emission .",
    "figure 3 gives the map of our full sample of 12511 sources , obtained by using the above mask . by means of this procedure",
    ", we constructed 3 matrices with indexes ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) spanning galactic coordinates , whose elements contained either the number of sources in the bins per unit solid angle @xmath155 or a masking flag .",
    "these matrices will be referred to as bin maps in the following .    in the first part of our analysis",
    "we compute all the possible differences between the values of @xmath155 in adjacent windows and then the rms value .",
    "this amounts to calculating the quantity @xmath156 of eq .",
    "( [ rms ] ) for sharp - edge beams , except for the fact that observation windows are not circular . in order to minimize errors introduced by non - circular shapes , we maintain beam self - similarity in the generation of larger beamwidths : starting from the above bin sizes we merge adjacent beams so that both @xmath144 and @xmath145 are doubled at each step .",
    "the effective beam diameter @xmath27covers the range from @xmath157 to @xmath39 at logarithmically spaced intervals .",
    "this procedure is similar to the one described in fabbri & natale ( 1990 ) .",
    "the present analysis only differs in the treatment of masked bins in the merging process : composed windows are now rejected when more than one bin is masked , otherwise the masked bin is filled with the average number of sources evaluated on all unmasked bins in the whole map .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath158 and @xmath159 are given in fig .",
    "4 with error bars at 1 sigma .",
    "ideally the two data sets should coincide up to a multiplicative factor .",
    "the figure shows that this is verified to a good accuracy : quite small deviations arise from differences in the masks constructed at different resolutions .",
    "the data set with @xmath160 is not reported here , since it gives no new results and the first data point could not be compared to theory for the reasons explained in sect.2 .",
    "we also computed the correlation function at @xmath161 by means of the equation @xmath162 ^{-1 }   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\sum \\left [ n(i_b , i_l)-\\left\\langle n\\right\\rangle \\right ] \\left [ n(j_b , j_l)-\\left\\langle n\\right\\rangle \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation is performed over all pairs of beams such that the angular separation of center coordinates lies in the range @xmath163 .",
    "the number of such pairs is @xmath164 , and @xmath165 with @xmath166 an integer .",
    "masked bins are simply skipped in this computation .",
    "now we can not maintain self - similarity ; therefore we excluded two galactic polar cups at @xmath167 where the stretching of bin shapes is strong .",
    "figure 5 reports data in the range @xmath168 .    in order to treat the peak number statistics",
    ", we should take into account that theoretical predictions are available for smooth distributions over the celestial sphere .",
    "for any distribution of discrete sources we encounter the following problem , that moving a sharp - edge beam across the sky the detected source number varies in a discontinuous manner .",
    "therefore we must limit ourselves to smooth beams , and in this paper we shall consider gaussian beams . in principle , for each beam position in the sky we should weight all sources in the sample by a smoothing gaussian factor @xmath169 $ ] , with @xmath170the source angular separation from the beam center . in practice",
    "it is more efficient to replace the actual content of each bin by an effective , smoothed number of sources according to the formula @xmath171 } { { \\sum } \\exp \\left [ -\\frac 12\\left ( \\vartheta _ { i_b i_l } /\\sigma",
    "\\right ) ^2\\right ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath172 is the angular separation between cells @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "masked bins obviously are disregarded .",
    "now a complication arises from the fact that the measured number of peaks explicitly depends on both @xmath27and @xmath157 , while theory assuming a continuous sampling of the source number - density field only predicts the @xmath127-dependence .",
    "therefore , to consistently compare data at varying values of @xmath27we had to require similar geometries , i.e. equal ratios @xmath175 . since we considered four logarithmically spaced values of @xmath27 in the range @xmath176 , from our bin maps we can build three sets of data with @xmath177 , 0.47 , and 0.93 respectively .",
    "each set includes a triplet of values of @xmath127 ; for instance , for @xmath178 we can collect data at @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 taking advantage of all of our bin maps .",
    "in practice starting from 3 original bin maps we must build 9 smoothed maps , corresponding to specific values of @xmath27and @xmath147 , and in each of them we search for local maxima of the @xmath182 distribution . the search was performed comparing the source number of each bin with those of eight contiguous bins .",
    "we handled with the presence of holes in the map developing algorithms which extended the analysis to larger neighborhoods of potential maxima .",
    "the presence of very few uncertain cases does not affect our results .",
    "the identified peaks were then normalized to the rms source - number fluctuation calculated for each smoothed map , and the distribution @xmath26 was computed for 7 equally spaced values of @xmath29 between 0.1 and 1.6 . since the number of peaks should then be extrapolated to the whole sky , we have to evaluate the effective area associated to the distribution of detected peaks .",
    "we adopt two procedures : ( a ) we only include sky bins connected to the two big unmasked continents at @xmath183 and surrounded by no more than 5 masked bins , and ( b ) we accept all unmasked bins .",
    "figure [ ex6a ] gives @xmath26 , extrapolated to the whole sky from the entire set of unmasked bins using the first method above .",
    "since only data sets with fixed @xmath175 are homogeneous , the figure shows 3 distinct meshes . for the case",
    "@xmath184 only two values of @xmath108 are considered because data at @xmath185 could not be compared with theory . accepting",
    "all unmasked bins for the computation of areas slightly lowers the peak numbers , but this has no important effect as will be seen in sect .",
    "4 . figure [ ex6b ] reports @xmath186 for the case @xmath187 , derived from the north and south halves of the sample . in this figure",
    "the peak number is extrapolated to one half of the sky .",
    "error bars at 1 sigma are evaluated as @xmath188 , with @xmath189 the unmasked sky fraction .",
    "such errors are reported in figs .",
    "[ ex7a ] and [ ex7b ] .",

    "cosmic variance is just this noise term . in order to check that this interpretation is correct , we attributed the standard cosmic - variance uncertainty @xmath264@xmath335 to all of the models which best fitted any one of our tests , and derived the corresponding uncertainties @xmath336 on the theoretical quantities @xmath264@xmath337 , @xmath24 and",

[ ex10 ] , it follows that low - density cdm models are not clearly ruled out by our tests",

    "collins et al .",
    "our basic conclusions remain unchanged for different source parameters and sharply - peaked spectral shapes provided only that iras sources already existed at @xmath344 .",
    "the quality of hdm fits suggests that @xmath3 is characterized by some length scale smaller than appearing from the analyses of redshift surveys .",
    "possible objections to this result might involve the reliability of the sample , the ability of our tests to effectively probe the full perturbation spectrum and contamination from small , non - linear scales .    as to the first point",
    ", we are confident that our sample is reliable . similar results ( using single - scale models and two of the present tests ) were obtained from another sample derived from iras psc , version i with more conservative selection criteria ( fabbri & natale 1990 , 1993 ) .",
    "thus there is no chance that our results might be affected by star contamination .",
    "no problem should arise from the finite depth of the sample . applying the peak statistics separately to the south and north halves of the sky",
    "we reduced the effective linear scale of the sample by a factor 2@xmath345 , but we observed no shift of the best - fitted wavelength or the confidence regions to lower scales . also , our models carefully take into account the flux interval of the sample , the source luminosity function and the relativistic expression of the luminosity distance ; they explicitly allow for the effective depth arising from the interplay of such factors .",
    "so there is no reason why such a length scale should strongly affect our tests , nor why a spectrum like ( [ hot ] ) should fit data better than equation ( [ cold ] ) .",
    "[ in fact , the luminosity function of saunders et al .",
    "( 1990 ) does not even allow us identifying a length scale so sharply . ]",
    "the depth of the sample could drastically affect the fittings only if it arised from a strong cutoff , totally independent of the above factors and effective at redshifts @xmath346 0.1 .",
    "there is no evidence for such a cutoff .",
    "we previously studied the effect of varying the lower flux limit on version i of psc and found no effects of this kind ( fabbri & natale 1990 ) .",
    "we further notice that jing & valdarnini ( 1993 ) use the redshift field of 2-jy iras galaxies to infer a peak wavelength of @xmath347 mpc .",
    "the median depth of their sample is quite smaller than ours .",
    "thus the different results arise from the different techniques , not from peculiarities of our sample .",
    "it is therefore important to notice that the shape of the window functions which can be defined for our tests do not weight small length scales to a pathological extent ; actually they weight them less than a 2-dimensional analysis based on iras redshift survey ( scharf and lahav 1993 ) .",
    "all of the above considerations can not prove of course that our best value for @xmath46 should be the location of the absolute maximum of @xmath3 .",
    "we are aware that best - fit procedures are not equivalent to directly constructing the shape of @xmath3 from data .",
    "this consideration is especially important because we find that our tests , when applied to cdm models , point to larger length scales .",
    "this apparently strange result may also be linked to the fact that in 2-dimensional analyses length scales are smeared out ; under this respect 3-dimensional studies ( e.g. feldman et al . 1994 ) are superior .",
    "however , the quality of our hdm low - wavelength fits and the arguments discussed in the introduction makes us suspect that current spectra obtained from redshift catalogs may not represent the correct @xmath3 in real space very accurately . although there is a qualitative agreement between spectra inferred from visible and iras galaxies and clusters , a close inspection of the papers by fisher et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , einasto et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and jing & valdarnini ( 1993 ) shows significant differences between the spectra proposed by these authors .",

    "5 of jing & valdarnini , but we believe its strength is too weak to justify our findings . a recent work by baugh & efstathiou ( 1993 ) studies the 2-dimensional correlation function in the apm survey and recovers @xmath3 by the method of lucy ( 1974 ) .",
    "their spectrum rises above a power law around 30@xmath349 mpc and appears to be peaked at 100@xmath349 mpc .",
