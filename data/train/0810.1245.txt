    "galaxies , galaxy groups and clusters are widely held to form under the drive of the gravitational instability that acts on initial perturbations modulating the cosmic density of the dominant cold dark matter ( dm ) component .",
    "the instability at first is kept in check by the cosmic expansion , but when the local gravity prevails collapse sets in .",
    "the standard sequence runs as follows : a slightly overdense region expands more slowly than its surroundings , progressively detaches from the hubble expansion , halts and turns around ; then it collapses , and eventually virializes to form a dm ` halo ' in equilibrium under self - gravity .",
    "the amplitude of more massive perturbations is smaller , so the formation is hierarchical with the massive structures forming typically later ( see peebles 1993 ) .",
    "such a formation history has been confirmed and resolved to a considerable detail by many intensive @xmath3body simulations .",
    "early on ( white 1986 ) these added an important block of information , i.e. , the growth of a halo actually includes merging events with other clumps of sizes comparable ( ` major ' mergers ) or substantially smaller ( ` minor ' mergers ) , down to nearly smooth accretion ( see springel et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "more recently , a second round of features has been increasingly recognized in highly resolved simulations of individual halos forming in cosmological volumes ( zhao et al .",
    "2003 ; diemand et al .",
    "2007 ) , to the effect of identifying in the growth two definite stages : an early fast collapse including a few violent major mergers , and a later calmer stage comprising many minor mergers and smooth accretion . during the early collapse a substantial mass",
    "is gathered , while the major mergers reshuffle the gravitational potential wells and cause the collisionless dm particles to undergo dynamical relaxation ; therefrom the halo emerges with a definite structure of the inner density and gravitational potential . during the later stage , moderate amounts of mass are slowly accreted mainly onto the outskirts , little affecting the inner structure and potential , but quiescently rescaling upwards the overall size ( see hoffman et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in the resulting simulated halos , the coarse - grained proxy @xmath13 to the phase - space density  defined in terms of the dm density @xmath2 and of the radial velocity dispersion @xmath1 ",
    "is empirically found to be stable after the collapse , and distributed in the form of a powerlaw with _ uniform _ slope @xmath14 around @xmath15 throughout the halo s bulk where it is amenable to noise - free measurements ( see taylor & navarro 2001 ; dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ; ascasibar & gottlber 2008 ) .",
    "taking up such a notion , the present paper starts (   2 ) from investigating the wide set of macroscopic equilibria for the dm under self - gravity , as described by the jeans equation .",
    "it proceeds (   3 ) to the semianalytic description of their time buildup to constrain their governing parameters , and so predict the halo realistic structure .",
    "it proposes (   4 ) physical interpretations for such parameters .",
    "the paper is concluded (   5 ) with a summary of our findings and a discussion of the perspectives they open .    throughout",
    "we adopt the standard , flat cosmological model with normalized matter density @xmath16 , dark energy density @xmath17 , and hubble constant @xmath18 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 .",
    "the static equilibria of the dm halos obey the jeans equation that , on neglecting for the time being anisotropies and the blend into the large - scale environment to be discussed in   5 , reads @xmath20    to elicit the contents of this macroscopic - like equation , an explicit link is required between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "such a link may be provided by @xmath23 , or by the equivalent quantity @xmath24 ; this is often named dm ` entropy ' in view of its formal analogy with the adiabat of a gas in thermal equilibrium , and is increasingly used in the context of dm equilibria , from taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) to faltenbacher et al .",
    "we focus on this function of state @xmath25 in the configuration space , and comment on our choice in   5 .    in terms of the slope @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) is recast into the particularly simple form @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the ( squared ) circular velocity , that provides a natural scaling for the depth of the dm potential well .    taking up from the simulation phenomenology only the notion that @xmath5 be _ uniform _ throughout the halo bulk ( see   1 ) , we will discuss the range of values to be expected for @xmath5 as a clue to their origin .",
    "in fact , in their pioneering work taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) selected a value of the exponent close to @xmath29 .",
    "other , recent studies have provided similar values for @xmath5 : around @xmath30 according to ascasibar et al . (",
    "2004 ) , and around @xmath31 according to rasia et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . beyond the minor differences , it is the _ narrow _ empirical range that constituted an unsolved challenge .",
    "we begin with looking first ( after taylor & navarro 2001 ) at powerlaw solutions of eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the form @xmath32 , with the entropy run set to @xmath33 ; then not only @xmath5 is a given parameter , but also the slope @xmath34 is a _ constant _ to be determined from eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the form @xmath35 here the ` bare ' constant @xmath36 compares the gravitational potential to the random kinetic energy associated with the velocity dispersion at a reference point @xmath37 . at the r.h.s",
    "@xmath38 appears as modulated by @xmath39dependencies , produced by the integrated dynamical mass @xmath40 to yield @xmath41 in the powerlaw case , and by the local dependencies from @xmath42 .    for a powerlaw solution to actually hold the r.h.s",
    ". must be constant , which yields the link @xmath43 as pointed out by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) , hansen ( 2004 ) , and austin et al .",

    "( 3 ) imposes on the dimensionless gravitational pull the constraint @xmath44 whose nonlinearities reflect the dm self - gravity .",
    "thus the allowed powerlaw solutions must lie on a parabola in the plane @xmath45 and on a straight line in the plane @xmath46 , as illustrated in the top panels of fig .  1 ;",
    "note that to ensure @xmath47 the overall bounds @xmath48 must hold , implying that @xmath49 applies for the powerlaw solutions .",
    "two notable instances correspond to the values @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the former yields the standard , singular isothermal sphere with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; the latter holds for the value of @xmath5 originally selected by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) , and implies @xmath54 and @xmath55 . note that they are located on the intersections of the parabola eq .",
    "( 5 ) with the line @xmath56 , see fig .  1",
    ".    the powerlaw solutions of the jeans equation with slope @xmath57 will turn out to be tangent to the full solutions at @xmath58 so as to provide a useful reference slope in the middle of the halo .",
    "however , they do not qualify as relevant solutions since at both extremes they suffer of unphysical features : since @xmath49 holds as shown above , the force @xmath59 would diverge at the center , while the mass @xmath60 would diverge toward large @xmath61 .    to avoid these drawbacks , in all physically relevant solutions the running slope",
    "@xmath62 is to bend down from the middle value in going toward large and small @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath63 one can infer from eq .",
    "( 3 ) that asymptotically @xmath64 is to hold if the gravitational force is to be finite , which implies that both sides of eq .",
    "( 3 ) vanish ( see austin et al .",
    "2005 ) ; on the other hand , for @xmath65 it is seen that either @xmath66 holds or a density cutoff occurs , if the mass @xmath40 is to saturate to a constant , implying @xmath67 . in other words , powerlaws with inner @xmath68 and outer slope @xmath69",
    "will constitute asymptotic or effective approximations to the full solutions .",
    "for example , for the value @xmath70 one recovers the slopes @xmath71 and @xmath72 , found by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) in their archetypical full solution .",
    "thus all full solutions may be conveniently visualized as _ bent down _ from the corresponding tangent powerlaw so as to meet the above asymptotic forms at both small and large radii .",
    "these solutions will be analytically studied and constrained next .",
    "in fact , the solution space of the jeans equation is analytically rich , so we refer the interested reader to the works by austin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) , and barnes et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) for extensive coverage .",
    "here we summarize the main results and proceed to focus on the ` critical ' solutions in the terminology of taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) .    to highlight the properties of these solutions with running @xmath62 , it is convenient ( see dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ; austin et al .",
    "2005 ; also barnes et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) to replace the original jeans equation @xmath73 with its first and second derivative , and use the differential mass definition @xmath74 , to obtain @xmath75 here @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the first and second logarithmic derivative of @xmath78 with respect to @xmath61 ; in addition , @xmath37 is the point where the density slope matches @xmath57 ( see eq .  [ 4 ] ) , while @xmath79 and @xmath80 are shorthands for the inner and the outer effective slopes anticipated above .    in the second equation",
    "the normalization constant @xmath81 does not appear explicitly ; however , from the first eq .",
    "( 6 ) evaluated at @xmath37 it is easily recognized that @xmath82 is related to @xmath83 , and in a full solution specifically measures the upward deviation of @xmath38 from the corresponding powerlaw , that is , above the parabola expressed by eq .",
    "( 5 ) , see also fig .  1 .",
    "in fact , as the value of @xmath38 increases at given @xmath5 , the solutions will be progressively curved down both inward and outward of @xmath37 , to constitute a bundle _ tangent _ to the related powerlaw with slope given by eq .  ( 4 ) .",
    "but , as stressed by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) , only a definite maximal value @xmath12 can be withstood by the halo at equilibrium , lest the solution develops pathologies like a central hole ; this value marks a ` critical ' solution .",
    "correspondingly , the values for @xmath8 may be found by a painstaking trial - and - error procedure , as done by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) for the particular case @xmath84 .",
    "more conveniently , they may be computed directly through eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ; the former also provides the following exhaustive description of the solutions .    in",
    "the _ inner _ region only three situations possibly arise ( williams et al .",
    "2004 , dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ) : ( i ) @xmath78 attains the value @xmath85 asymptotically for @xmath86 , which is unphysical since such a solution would end there with a diverging gravitational force ; ( ii ) the solution attains the value @xmath68 at a finite radius , and then continues to flatten down to the point of developing a central hole , which is obviously to be avoided ; ( iii ) @xmath78 approaches the value @xmath68 asymptotically for @xmath86 , that is the only _ viable _ possibility .",
    "thus physical solutions must approach the inner slope @xmath68 , and must steepen monotonically outwards .",
    "however , not all of them are tenable in view of their _ outer _ behavior ( austin et al . 2005 , dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ) . here , again three situations formally arise that depend on the value of @xmath5 : ( i ) @xmath78 approaches the value @xmath85 asymptotically for @xmath65 , which occurs for @xmath87 and is unphysical since with such a solution the mass would diverge ( in practice , it would be ill - defined , see ",
    "5 ) ; ( ii ) @xmath78 attains the slope @xmath69 at a finite radius and then goes to an outer cutoff , that occurs for @xmath88 and is physically _ viable _ since the cutoffs actually set in at large radii exterior to the halo s bulk , as discussed below ; ( iii ) @xmath78 approaches the slope @xmath69 asymptotically for @xmath89 as it occurs for @xmath90 , which also provides a physically _ viable _ solution .",
    "summing up , the critical solutions satisfy both sets of criteria , but exist only for @xmath91 ( which excludes the case corresponding to the isothermal powerlaw ) ; hereafter these will be named ` @xmath5-_profiles _ ' .",
    "we compute them by integrating the second of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) with boundary conditions @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "the results in the plane @xmath95 for various @xmath5 between @xmath96 and @xmath97 are plotted as different lines in fig .  1 ( left bottom panel ) ; there we can read out the values of @xmath83 at @xmath98 ( squares in the figure ) , and find the related @xmath12 after eq .  ( 7 ) .",
    "the relation @xmath8 is plotted in fig .  1 ( right bottom panel ) ;",
    "the resulting correlation is fitted by the expression @xmath99 to better than @xmath100 .",
    "our solutions include the prototypical one corresponding to @xmath84 ( highlighted in blue ) , first found by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) and shown to be well fitted , if only in a region around @xmath37 , by the nfw formula ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) ; for such a solution the precise value of @xmath12 reads @xmath101 , see dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) .",
    "our solutions also include the one corresponding to the limiting value @xmath90 ( highlighted in red ) studied by dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) ; for this @xmath102 is found .    in fig .",
    "2 we illustrate the radial dependencies of various interesting quantities for the @xmath5-profiles : density @xmath2 and its logarithmic slope @xmath78 , circular velocity @xmath103 , velocity dispersion @xmath104 , entropy @xmath105 , mass @xmath40 , and gravitational potential @xmath106 ; the profiles are normalized to @xmath107 at the point @xmath37 within the halo s middle .",
    "outwards of this , solutions corresponding to larger values of @xmath5 have larger overall masses , flatter density profiles , higher velocity dispersions , and deeper potential wells .    as mentioned above , the @xmath5-profiles with @xmath108 show an outer cutoff , to which the following remarks apply .",
    "first , the cutoffs generally occur beyond the virial radius ( see   5 ) .",
    "second , the velocity dispersion @xmath109 falls rapidly outside of @xmath37 and vanishes at the density cutoff , thus preventing any finite outflow related to residual random motions of dm particles .",
    "third , the microscopic distribution function as obtained through the eddington formula ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) from pairs of @xmath22 and @xmath110 is realistic being nowhere negative ( see also zhao 1996 ; widrow 2000 ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the ratio @xmath111 entering eq .",
    "( 2 ) ; we also show the energy distributions associated to the @xmath5-profiles : the specific potential energy @xmath112 @xmath113 , the random kinetic energy @xmath114 , and the local virial ratio @xmath115 .",
    "note that the latter tends to @xmath107 at large @xmath61 , as is expected for stable self - gravitating halos ( see okas & mamon 2001 ) ; in fact , it closely approaches unity already for @xmath116 .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot as a function of @xmath5 various characteristic radii ( in units of @xmath37 ) of the @xmath5-profiles ; specifically , we show the radius @xmath117 where the circular velocity @xmath118 peaks , the radius @xmath119 where the velocity dispersion @xmath21 peaks , the radius @xmath120 where the slope of the density profile reads @xmath121 , and the radius @xmath122 where the slope of the profile takes on the value @xmath123 .",
    "note that @xmath124 is always large , and formally recedes to infinity ( as represented in the plot with an arrow ) for the limiting case @xmath90 that has a powerlaw falloff .    for the sake of clarity , in these figures",
    "we have confined the values of @xmath5 to between @xmath96 and @xmath97 ; although the upper bound is already required for having no central hole and a finite mass as discussed above , limited information existed so far concerning lower bounds from the isotropic jeans equation .",
    "here we show that the cosmogonic _ histories _ of dm halos enforce additional , stringent _ limitations _ to the range of @xmath5 ; on the high side the resulting bound turns out to be pleasingly close to the value @xmath97 derived above from the analysis of the static jeans equation , but on the low side it constitutes a new stringent result .",
    "consider a dm halo with current bounding radius @xmath125 , density @xmath2 , mass @xmath126 , velocity scales @xmath127 , and entropy @xmath128 . during the hierarchical buildup the running growth rate scales as @xmath129 with the inflow speed @xmath130 set by the depth of the dm well and hence proportional to @xmath131 ; thus the above quantities may be expressed in terms of @xmath132 and @xmath133 to provide the scaling laws : @xmath134      primarily we look for a link of the entropy slope @xmath5 with the mass growth rate in simple terms ; this analysis will have only heuristic scope , introductory to the full study performed in   3.2 .",
    "toward our scope , we make contact with the classic line of developments ( fillmore & goldreich 1984 ; lu et al .",
    "2006 ) that analytically relate the collapse histories to the _ shape _ and growth rate of the primordial dm perturbations .",
    "the former may be expressed in terms of @xmath135 ; but since a halo virializes when @xmath136 attains a critical threshold ( e.g. , @xmath137 in the critical universe ) , the shape parameter @xmath138 effectively governs also the ( inverse ) mass growth rate defined in terms of the scaling @xmath139 .",
    "then we use the standard relations between redshift @xmath140 and cosmic time @xmath141 , that may be expressed in the form @xmath142 . in the critical cosmology",
    "@xmath143 holds ; in the canonical concordance cosmology the value @xmath144 still applies to @xmath145 , but as @xmath140 decreases @xmath146 progressively rises to values @xmath147 for @xmath148 . then the mass growth history writes simply @xmath149 and the growth rate reads @xmath150 ; from eqs .",
    "( 8) , simple algebra yields the scaling laws @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 . on eliminating @xmath141 one obtains @xmath154 and @xmath155 with slopes @xmath156 the latter being related to the former by the simple scaling link @xmath157 , as expected at @xmath116 from eq .",
    "( 4 ) . from eq .  ( 9 ) @xmath5 is seen to be slightly larger than unity by a quantity slowly depending on @xmath158 ; this is consistent with @xmath159 , the straightforward message from eqs .",
    "( 8) with @xmath160 .",
    "these relationships for @xmath5 and @xmath78 embody in a simple form some relevant cosmogonic and cosmological information . for @xmath161 where @xmath144 applies ,",
    "one explicitly has @xmath162 and relatedly @xmath163 , the latter being the well - known expression for the similarity solutions to the spherical infall model in a critical universe . for @xmath148 instead",
    "when @xmath164 applies , one has @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "as said , the remaining parameter @xmath167 governs both the shape of the initial perturbations and the times of their collapse .",
    "for instance , if the standard top - hat shape applied with @xmath168 corresponding to a monolithic collapse , from the above relations one would obtain @xmath169 and @xmath170 for halos that virialize at @xmath161 , as pointed out early on by bertschinger ( 1985 ) ; for more massive halos that virialize at @xmath148 , from the scaling laws one anticipates a slightly _ steeper _ @xmath171 and a _ flatter _",
    "@xmath172 .",
    "qualitatively , different values of the slope @xmath78 may be related to other values of @xmath167 , such as occurring in an articulated shape of the initial perturbations , that also yields a sequence of collapse times . with a realistic bell - shaped perturbation @xmath168 still applies to its middle ; in the outer regions @xmath173 implies the accretion to become slower , and correspondingly the density slope @xmath78 to steepen there relative to the middle one .",
    "the central regions are described by @xmath174 , corresponding to fast collapse ; the scaling law then suggests the density slope to be flatter there .",
    "however , this simple approach can not be carried very far . at small radii also",
    "angular momentum effects come into play to lower the density profile ; they introduce another radial scaling related to centrifugal barriers , as discussed in detail by lu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ; these authors show how a density slope around @xmath175 is enforced if efficient isotropization of particles orbits takes place during the fast collapse , while still flatter slopes occur with more even angular momentum distributions .",
    "these , however , must be consistent with the overall equilibrium requirements ; these orbital features are actually subsumed into the macroscopic jeans eq .",
    "( 2 ) with @xmath176 and provide the running @xmath177 ( the last term is shown in fig .",
    "3 ) that is to replace the stiff scaling value @xmath157 above , but still recovers it at the single radius @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "[ 4 ] and [ 6 ] ) .",
    "so we will _",
    "depart _ from the above heuristic approach , and focus on computing the values of @xmath5 to be inserted into jeans , also implementing precise mass and time dependencies of the growth rate @xmath167 . to focus these sensitive issues a refined analysis and a careful discussion",
    "are required and performed next .",
    "we derive a robust time evolution and mass dependence of @xmath133 from an updated version of the extended press & schechter formalism ( eps , see lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "we are mainly interested in the average evolutionary behavior of halos , so we compute the mean growth rate @xmath133 of the current mass @xmath132 as @xmath178 in terms of the differential _ merger rate _ @xmath179 given in appendix a.",
    "this incorporates the full cosmological framework , and the detailed cold dm perturbation spectrum ; as to the former we implement the concordance cosmology , and as for the latter we adopt the shape given by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) corrected for baryons ( sugiyama 1995 ) , and normalized as to yield a mass variance @xmath180 on a scale of @xmath181 mpc .",
    "we improve over previous studies of this kind ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2006 ; li et al . 2007 ;",
    "salvador - sol et al . 2007 ) by using the merger rate appropriate for ellipsoidal collapses ( sheth & tormen 2002 ) as provided by zhang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; this is shown by the latter authors to yield formation times and growth rates in much closer agreement with numerical simulations than the standard eps theory .",
    "further details are presented in appendix a.    eq .",
    "( 10 ) provides the relation @xmath182 illustrated in fig .",
    "5 . this may be viewed as a first order differential equation for @xmath183 , that is numerically solved once the mass @xmath184 at the present time @xmath185 has been assigned in the way of a boundary condition . in terms of @xmath183",
    "so computed , the evolution of the halo properties are obtained through eqs .",
    "( 8) ; the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , where we plot the time and redshift evolutions for the inverse growth rate @xmath167 , the overall radius @xmath125 , the mass @xmath132 , the characteristic velocities @xmath186 , the entropy @xmath105 , and finally the corresponding slope @xmath187 .",
    "the curves are for different _ current _ values of the halo masses @xmath184 ranging from @xmath188 to @xmath189 .",
    "in fact , in these detailed mass accretion histories one can recognize a _ transition _ epoch when the circular velocity @xmath131 of the halo attains its highest value along an accretion history ( see li et al .",
    "the transition separates two stages : an early stage of fast _ collapse _ , when @xmath190 corresponds to a growth rate still high on the running hubble timescale , and nearly constant ; and a later phase of slower _ accretion _ when @xmath167 takes off from the value @xmath191 , i.e. , the growth rate is low and decreasing .",
    "small halos with @xmath192 have high transition redshifts , hence are now well advanced into their slow accretion stage ; on the other hand , very massive ones with @xmath193 have low transition redshifts , so today they have just completed their fast accretion stage .",
    "a similar behavior has been identified in a number of recent numerical simulations ( zhao et al .",
    "2003 ; diemand et al .",
    "2007 ) , and has been recognized also in other semianalytic computations based on the simpler , less precise eps theory ( see li et al .",
    "2007 ; neistein et al .",
    "2006 ) .      from fig .",
    "6 we also see that the values of @xmath5 at the transition are narrowly _ constrained _ to within @xmath194 , i.e. , a @xmath195 range .",
    "we note that this range explains why narrowly constrained phenomenological values of @xmath5 are found within the halo _ bulk _ from many and different simulations since the year 2000 .",
    "in particular , our values turn out to agree with the best fitting exponent of @xmath23 [ or @xmath25 ] with its scatter recently given in detail by ascasibar & gottlber ( 2008 ) within the halo bulk during calm infall ; these authors warn against extrapolating their results to early times and outer radii .    correspondingly , in our findings the values of @xmath5 before the transition should not be overinterpreted nor inserted into the jeans equation .",
    "in fact , at these early epochs the halos experience rapid changes and are clearly out of equilibrium ; during this stage the @xmath3body experiments ( see zhao et al .",
    "2003 ; peirani et al .",
    "2006 ; hoffman et al . 2007 ) highlight turmoil associated with fast collapse and major mergers , effective dynamical relaxation and mixing of dm particles . taking up from   3.1 ,",
    "it is during these events that the orbits angular momentum must set to a near isotropic distribution such as to lower the inner densities .",
    "but as the turmoil associated with the fast collapse subsides , the orbital structure is bypassed and replaced by the macroscopic entropy distribution @xmath176 with uniform values of @xmath5 , as phenomenologically found to hold throughout the now stable halos bulk . then the values of @xmath5 at the transition epoch and the corresponding edge @xmath197 can be derived from the scaling laws and applied to the whole inner region , to obtain @xmath198 , taking on the value @xmath199 _ only _ at the point @xmath37 according to the results of   2.1 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is expected to persist in the bulk during the subsequent development in the slow accretion stage , when mass is added smoothly and mainly onto the outskirts , with little mixing .",
    "such a development is borne out by the widely shared scenario of halo buildup from the inside out , championed by bertschinger ( 1985 ) , taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) , and many others up to salvador - sol et al .",
    "specifically , the analysis by the former authors concerning the randomization and the stratification of particles orbits during secondary infall indicates that their internal disposition is little affected by subsequent , smoother mass additions on top of a closely static potential well .",
    "thus during the late , slow accretion stage the structure for @xmath200 will be unaffected .",
    "meanwhile , the _",
    "scale @xmath201 beyond @xmath37 is increasingly stretched out to substantially larger values ( see fig .  6 , top right panel ) ; correspondingly , we find the outer slope @xmath202 at @xmath203 to decline in time ( see fig .  6 , bottom right panel ) .",
    "this translates into a radial decrease @xmath204 on maintaining entropy stratification also into these regions ( see bertschinger 1985 , taylor & navarro 2001 ) .",

    "here we propose to discuss the physical meaning of the quantity @xmath12 ( defined in   2.1 following taylor & navarro 2001 ) in terms of a direct energetic argument .",

    "minimal _ level of randomized energy @xmath233 .",
    "we now show that to a very good approximation the value for @xmath12 may be obtained from considering _ incomplete _ conversion of the infall kinetic energy @xmath234 of dm particles into their dynamically randomized energy @xmath235 during formation ; a process introduced by bertschinger ( 1985 ) , different from the complete violent relaxation proposed by lynden - bell ( 1967 ) and discussed widely , including the recent arad & lynden - bell ( 2005 ) , trenti & bertin ( 2005 ) and trenti et al .",

    "7 shows how well eq .  ( 13 ) recovers the @xmath8 relation obtained through numerical integration of the jeans equation .",
    "this excellent fit to @xmath12 means that the expression for @xmath238 in eq .",

    "s suggestion we add that what ultimately the first eq .",
    "( 12 ) describes with the isotropic form of its l.h.s .",
    "is a partial effective conversion at @xmath255 from radial infall into tangential motions .",
    "the general picture of dm halo formation as it emerges from recent @xmath3body simulations envisages a progressive buildup through a two - stage development . at early epochs major mergers associated with fast reshaping of the bulk gravitational potential cause particles orbits to dynamically relax and mix into a definite equilibrium disposition . at later epochs the halo outskirts progressively build up through rare if persisting minor mergers and by smooth mass accretion , settling to a quasi - static equilibrium .",
    "the stable equilibria soon after the early stage are effectively described in terms of a phenomenological entropy run @xmath176 with uniform slope @xmath5 somewhat larger than @xmath107 . spurred by this powerlaw behavior , one might look for powerlaw solutions of the jeans equation for the equilibrium density profiles , only to find these just tangent to the actual solutions . from here our analysis",
    "goes beyond powerlaw densities , and provides two related blocks of novel results .",
    "first , we have computed and illustrated a wide set of novel solutions to the isotropic jeans equation , that we name @xmath5-_profiles _ , including as two particular instances the prototypes investigated by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) and dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) .",
    "we have stressed that at given @xmath5 the solutions form a tangent bundle with @xmath22 progressively curved down as the gravitational pull measured by @xmath236 increases above the value corresponding to the pure powerlaw profile @xmath157 ; from such bundles the @xmath5-profiles stand out for having a shape maximally curved to the point of complying with sensible outer and inner behaviors , i.e. , finite total mass and no central hole .",
    "this occurs for a maximal value @xmath8 of the gravitational pull @xmath242 relative to the random component @xmath231 , i.e. , for a minimal @xmath231 compared to @xmath242 ; this also corresponds to the maximal slope @xmath256 at the point @xmath117 .",
    "such solutions still constitute a large set , being parameterized in terms of a wide overall range @xmath257 for the values of @xmath5 .",
    "second , we have shown that toward further constraining these values the key step is provided by the halos cosmological buildup ; in fact , the scaling laws of   3 narrowly restrict the viable _ range _ to @xmath258 , corresponding to current masses @xmath259 .",
    "we have found these bounds to apply at the epochs of _ transition _ from fast collapse to slow accretion , when the potential wells settle to their maximal depths along an accretion history ( see   3 ) .",
    "in fact , our semianalytic analysis not only recovers the two - stage development observed in many recent @xmath3body simulations , but also explains _",
    "why _ only such narrowly constrained values of @xmath5 are actually found in many different numerical works since the year 2000 .",
    "the values @xmath12 is correspondingly constrained to the range @xmath260 ; we trace back these values to limited _ randomization _ for the infall kinetic energy of dm particles during accretion , which leads to minimal values of @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath261profiles from the jeans equilibrium with @xmath5 and @xmath12 so constrained imply that galaxies have a generally more _ compact _ central structure than groups and clusters , with appreciable _ deviation _ from self - similarity ; on the other hand , the former have currently developed extensive outskirts , while the very rich clusters do not yet .    to embody in a handy expression the basic features of the density runs for the @xmath261profiles , we provide here an analytic fitting formula of the form often advocated on phenomenological grounds ( see zhao 1996 ; kravtsov et al . 1998 ; widrow 2000 ; barnes et al . 2006 ) , that reads @xmath262^{q}},\\ ] ] with @xmath68 governing the inner profile , @xmath146 the outer one , @xmath263 and @xmath264 the position and sharpness of the radial transition . here for the first time such a profile is _ substantiated _ with parameters expressed in terms of the derivatives of the jeans equation ( see   2.2 ) and of the values for @xmath5 as detailed in appendix b. we stress that the jeans equlibrium ( see fig .",
    "2 ) requires that the central slopes are always _ flatter _ , and the outer ones always _ steeper _ than in the empirical nfw fit .",
    "the goodness of the above fitting formula is discussed in appendix b , and illustrated in fig .",
    "we probe the physical relevance of the @xmath261profiles by comparing in fig .",
    "9 the related projected density runs with the results from recent , exquisite observations of strong and weak gravitational lensing in and around massive galaxy clusters , which just require _ flat _ inner , and _",
    "steep _ outer behaviors ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2008 , umetsu & broadhurst 2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is seen how _ straightforward _ are our fits in terms of high - mass @xmath261profiles that naturally exhibit just such features , compared to those in terms of the nfw empirical formula that not only has problems of ill - defined mass , but also would require particularly high concentrations and old ages .",
    "our findings substantiate the @xmath5-profiles , and stress their value as to specific predictions for future simulations aimed at resolving , and for weak gravitational lensing observations aimed at probing the outer cluster densities .",
    "a full discussion of these issues deserves a dedicated paper .",
    "two comments are in order concerning the validity of the jeans equation in the simple form of eq .",
    "first , reasonable anisotropies in the dm are described by the standard parameter @xmath265 ( binney 1978 ) , which numerical simulations suggest to increase with @xmath61 from central values @xmath266 meaning near isotropy to outer values close to @xmath267 , meaning progressive outward prevalence of radial motions ( see hansen & moore 2006 ) .",
    "such anisotropies inserted into jeans produce small variations of the @xmath261profiles , to the effect of slightly increasing the limiting value @xmath268 ; thus in the related limiting solutions the inner slope is flattened @xmath269 , the middle slope @xmath270 is steepened , and the outer slope @xmath271 is also steepened with respect to the isotropic case , see dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) . the oppositely extreme case of total radial anisotropy with constant @xmath272 discussed by austin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) would yield a lower limiting @xmath273 , while also producing a steep inner slope @xmath274 ( cf . ",
    "2.1 ) . in brief",
    ", the distinctive features of the @xmath261profiles are somewhat enhanced , if anything , with radially increasing anisotropies .",
    "second , the static jeans equation becomes increasingly vulnerable in going into the outermost regions , since static or even dynamic equilibrium is not granted beyond the virial radius .",
    "specifically , in the concordance cosmology the hubble expansion takes over at radii exceeding a few times the virial radius where @xmath275 holds .",
    "this weakens the case for the formal upper limit @xmath276 as derived from jeans analysis but correspondingly highlights the relevance of the ceiling @xmath277 for a few @xmath189 halo we have derived from cosmogonic evolution . on the other hand , any halo termination will be uncertain by full factors of @xmath252 ; with flat outer density slopes , as the case with @xmath87 ( see end of ",
    "2.1 ) , the related total masses will be ill - defined by similar factors , corresponding for galaxy clusters to a disturbing uncertainty by @xmath278 in abell richness class ( see yee & lpez - cruz 1999 ) .",
    "finally , we comment on our use of the dm ` entropy ' @xmath279  actually the analog of the thermodynamic adiabat , related to entropy by @xmath280  rather than the equivalent functional ` phase - space density ' @xmath281  that underlies the ` information ' @xmath282 with the obvious minus sign . matter - of - factly , the pressure gradient @xmath283 that withstands the self - gravity in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is most directly expressed in terms of the macroscopic quantity @xmath105 , in the form @xmath284 . in the way of interpretations ,",
    "our lead is provided by the positive - definite gradient @xmath285 , and specifically by its adimensional version @xmath286 .",
    "we find @xmath287 to be convenient in understanding the empirical evidence as to positive and uniform of @xmath5 within the halos bulk after the transition ; then and there , in fact , the particle orbits settle to a definite dynamical regime , relaxed toward a periodic , ordered behavior ( bertschinger 1985 ) , corresponding to _ lower _ entropy layers at the center . in the outer regions , on the other hand , the particle orbits stratify but mix poorly during the late , slow buildup ( see bertschinger 1985 ; taylor & navarro 2001 ) with their apocenters distributed over larger and larger sizes ; we understand this dynamical regime in terms of @xmath105 or @xmath288 spread over increasingly stretched radii @xmath289 , resulting in _ flatter _ slopes .",
    "it rests with the numerical values of @xmath5 to translate the fine orbital details into the macroscopic average of jeans , as clearly indicated by the consistency of the results from the latter with semianalytic cosmogony and with simulations .",
    "we end by stressing that the formulation of dm distribution in terms of ` entropy '  despite the standard objections about defining entropy for a collisionless medium out of thermal equilibrium and dominated by long range weak gravity  opens an interesting perspective ; this envisages direct comparisons ( see faltenbacher et al .",
    "2007 ) with the truly thermodynamic entropy of the other major component in galaxy systems , namely , the collisional plasma in local thermal equilibrium constituting the intracluster medium .",
    "in fact , in the outer regions these entropies though related as being both originated by conversion of the infall energy under _ weak _ gravity , differ owing to their origin from _ different _ conversion processes ( lapi et al .",
    "2005 ; cavaliere & lapi 2006 ) ; in addition , in the central region of most clusters the hot plasma is heated up by the activity of supermassive black holes originating under _ strong _ gravity conditions .",
