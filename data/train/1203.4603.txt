    "ever since its experimental discovery , graphene is in the spotlight of applied research in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of quasiparticles in graphene is governed by the dirac model @xcite , i.e. they satisfy the dirac equation where the speed of light @xmath0 is replaced by the so - called fermi velocity @xmath1 . due to this quasi - relativistic nature of electronic excitations ,",
    "much of the graphene physics is in fact described by quantum field theory ( qft ) , see @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "one the main obstacles to further industrialization of graphene is the gapless spectrum of quasi ",
    "excitations , and thus most of the recent research was devoted to investigation of the electron transport in graphene sheets and possible ways of generating a controllable mass ( energy ) gap , see discussion in  @xcite . on the other hand , the optical properties of monolayer graphene from the beginning proved themselves extraordinary .",
    "the very first measurement  @xcite of optical absorption in graphene revealed a surprisingly huge effect  monoatomic layers absorbed about @xmath2% of the incident light , exactly as predicted by the dirac model , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the optical properties of monolayer graphene samples in external magnetic field .",
    "we focus here on the faraday effect .",
    "it may be thought of as an analog of the hall effect considered at `` non - zero frequencies '' , and this similarity was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to conjecture that the former should be common for hall systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite the faraday rotation was related to possible non - compensation of parity - odd parts of the polarization tensor between various generations of fermions .",
    "other related works on magneto  optical properties of monolayer graphene include theoretical studies of the kiev group , e.g. @xcite , and numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "the quantity and quality of magneto - optical experimental data is growing .",
    "in the case of multilayer graphene samples the first measurements of transmission spectra were reported in @xcite , and the work was later continued in a series of papers , e.g. @xcite .",
    "more recently , both the faraday rotation and transmission in mono and multilayer epitaxial graphene were measured in @xcite .",
    "the faraday rotation appeared to be unexpectedly large and was dubbed the  giant faraday effect \" .",
    "the experimental setup of @xcite permitted a detailed investigation of the so called cyclotron resonance regime .",
    "to explore these effects we use a quantum field theory approach to the physics of graphene .",
    "relativistic dispersion relation of the electronic excitations in graphene makes qft a more adequate language to describe its properties as opposed to non ",
    "relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "application of the field ",
    "theoretical methods allow one to investigate such purely relativistic effects as the klein paradox , or appearance of gauge fields in graphene .",
    "it also permits to investigate other ideas of qft and quantum gravity in low energies bench  top experiments  a situation hardly imaginable even ten years ago .",
    "following this approach , we start with the dirac - maxwell action , where the spinors are confined to the graphene surface , while the electromagnetic field lives in the ambient @xmath3 dimensional space .",
    "electromagnetic field is not quantized , and is given by a sum of a constant magnetic field and a fluctuating one ( photons ) .",
    "the magnetic field is taken into account exactly , while in photons we keep the second order terms only .",
    "therefore , on the quantum field theory side we calculate a single one loop diagram ( though a quite complicated one , as the propagators contain the magnetic field , the chemical potential , the mass , and a phenomenological parameter which describes impurities ) .",
    "this calculation is similar to that of @xcite , but is done differently to facilitate a comparison to experimental data .    with some assumptions on the parameters ( frequency , magnetic field , impurities , etc )",
    "one can derive expression for conductivity of graphene and similar materials @xcite that are simpler than the ones given below .",
    "we like to stress , however , that the conductivity that we calculate and use is an _ exact _",
    "result of quantized dirac model at the first order of the fine - structure constant @xmath4 but without any restrictions on the other parameters .",
    "the advantages of having such expressions ( perhaps , complicated ) are obvious . among them is the possibility of a cleaner judgement of validity of this or that approximation .",
    "the price to pay is the use of the qft machinery and terminology .",
    "while the experiment of @xcite can be fitted by the drude model , the use of complete dirac model makes it possible to relate the optical properties of graphene to its microscopic parameters .",
    "it also permits to investigate and predict other regimes ( besides the cyclotron resonance one studied in @xcite ) , where both the faraday rotation and absorption are well pronounced .",
    "in particular , we reveal quantization of the faraday angle for clean samples , and predict pole  like peaks for relatively high frequencies .",
    "similar results were recently obtained in @xcite using an approximate method of ` equation of motion ' for calculation of the conductivities of graphene .",
    "we also like to mention the theoretical studies @xcite of the faraday effect and related phenomena in topological insulators , which are closely related to graphene @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in the next section",
    "we shortly review the basics of the dirac model in graphene . in section 3",
    "we formulate its connection to optical properties of both epitaxial and suspended samples . in section 4",
    "we present the calculation of the polarization operator in magnetic field both for ideally clean and realistic samples , and finally in section 5 we investigate the faraday rotation and transmission of light performing the fit of existing experimental data , and predicting new regimes .",

    "an interested reader can find its detailed description in a number of reviews , e.g. @xcite , while we briefly formulate the model itself .",

    "we shall find both diagonal and hall ac conductivities , see section [ sec - pol ] .",
    "the temporal component , @xmath43 , will be of no importance in our further considerations .",
    "let us consider a beam of light linearly polarized along the @xmath44 axis passing normally through a graphene layer on a substrate of a finite thickness @xmath45 . in a magnetic field the hall conductivity of graphene @xmath46 is non - zero .",
    "therefore both @xmath47 and @xmath48polarizations will be present in the transmitted light . the intensity of light measured after passing graphene , substrate _ and _ a polarizer rotated by angle @xmath49 in respect to the @xmath47axis is given by @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the transmission coefficient of @xmath47 , @xmath48polarizations , respectively .",

    "both polarization rotation angle and transmission oscillate rapidly with the frequency @xmath60 ( or with the substrate width @xmath45 ) .",
    "this effect is called the fabry  perot oscillations . however , in many cases the oscillations are smeared out due to low resolution of the measurements , or other sources of incoherence .",

    "indeed , if you consider , for example , @xmath136 ( [ g_i ] ) in the vicinity of @xmath137 you find out that it vanishes there and thus cancels out the corresponding denominator .",
    "similarly it behaves at all other points @xmath138 , etc . on the other hand , in the clean graphene",
    "the hall conductivity ( [ s_xy_0 ] ) ( and thus the polarization rotation angle ) has poles at p_0=(m_n_0 + 1m_n_0 ) .",

    "among the two points given in ( [ w0 ] ) for large chemical potential , we shall consider the first one only , since the second one @xmath148 corresponds to the frequencies that are too high .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior of the faraday rotation angle at the second point is similar to the one depicted on fig .",
    "[ on_p0 ] below .    before performing the numerical fitting",

    "thus , for comparing with observations we can replace the infinite summation in ( [ s_xy],[s_xx ] ) by a finite sum . for the given experimental data of @xcite , it proved to be sufficient to choose the summation range for @xmath114 from @xmath156 to @xmath157 . a rough estimate of the amplitude of the effect can be given by the main contribution with @xmath155 , @xmath158 which is in a reasonable agreement with direct numerical calculations ( as well as with experimental results , provided we put @xmath159 according to @xcite ) .    despite that the approximate formulas ( [ t_th_wrk ] ) give a correct order of magnitude estimate of the observed effect , to perform precise numerical fitting of the experimental data we should use the exact formulas ( [ ttsubs ] ) .",

    ". the former case might be applicable to the description of an epitaxial graphene subject to the gate voltage , while the later one is relevant for suspended graphene samples or for decoupled graphene layers  @xcite .    analyzing the conductivities similarly to the case of large @xmath83",
    ", one can show that for small or moderate chemical potential the biggest contribution to the sum ( [ t_th_wrk ] ) in the vicinity of ( [ poles ] ) comes from the @xmath102term .",
    "however , in this case the extremum of the real part of @xmath174 lie at @xmath175 , where g_n_0@xmath176 , here we assumed that @xmath177 . for a small mass gap , @xmath19 ,",
    "this value is almost independent of the landau level number , and thus the maximum of rotation angle is inversely proportional to the difference between corresponding landau levels _",

    "consequently , one has two identical contributions for @xmath181 , which is taken into account by @xmath182 in the formula above .",
    "the expression ( [ th_max ] ) gives a rough order of magnitude estimate of the faraday rotation at the @xmath120 level .",
    "for describing the effect in very clean graphene samples ( such as , e.g. , reported in @xcite where @xmath183mev ) one has to use complete expression ( [ tth ] ) to correctly take into account the @xmath184 terms .",

    "the maximum of rotation angle for such parameters has the order of magnitude predicted by ( [ th_max ] ) , however , the minima in transmission spectra calculated via ( [ tth ] ) are at least two times shallower than the ones predicted by ( [ tth_a ] ) .",
    "still , both effects in this case are very large for an one  atom thick material , and presumably can be measured after minor modifications of the existing experimental set - ups . on the other hand , a very promising experiment was recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was predicted there that with graphene placed in an optical cavity the faraday rotation can reach huge values in the infrared region ( up to 60 degrees ) and some modest values in the visible one .     as a function of chemical potential @xmath83[mev ] , for @xmath186 t , @xmath187mev for @xmath188mev ( up ) , and @xmath189mev ( down ) .",

    "[ on_mu],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    finally , we can consider the rotation angle ( [ tth_a ] ) as a function of chemical potential for a fixed frequency .",
    "one would naturally expect that for a small @xmath139 its behavior should be similar to the one in the ideal case .",
    "indeed , a numerical analysis shows that it is quantized in the same manner as the hall conductivity as defined by ( [ s_xy_0 ] ) . on the upper picture of fig .",
    "[ on_mu ] we plot the faraday rotation fixing the frequency close to @xmath190 . thus for @xmath191 the effect gets enhanced according to ( [ th_max ] ) . on the lower picture",
    "the frequency is far away from any special value , and thus the overall amplitude is much smaller .",
    "in the present paper we recalculated the polarization operator of the dirac quasi ",
    "particles in graphene in external magnetic field and established a clear connection between its components and optical properties of both suspended and epitaxial graphene .",
    "we showed , that in a number of different regimes the rotation of polarization of light passing through monolayer graphene samples is giant being of the order of @xmath192 rad , while the absorption can reach @xmath193% .",
    "in particular we showed that the data of the recent experiment on faraday rotation in the cyclotron resonance regime can be nicely fitted by predictions of the dirac model for sufficiently high magnetic fields ( starting with @xmath160 t ) .",
    "moreover , we predict that for smaller chemical potentials ( characteristic for suspended graphene ) the effect is still very pronounced .",
    "we envisage the pole  like peaks in the polarization rotation angle and the transmission spectra at relatively high frequencies .",
    "we also reveal that in clean graphene samples the faraday rotation as a function of chemical potential should be quantized in a similar fashion as the unconventional integer hall effect in graphene .",
