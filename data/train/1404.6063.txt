    "since its beginning , the study of light - matter interaction in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) has been providing a very fertile playground to test fundamental questions at the heart of quantum mechanics , together with the realization of very promising implementations of quantum processors  @xcite . recently",
    "the attention has also focused on the study of systems where photon hopping between neighboring cavities introduces an additional degree of freedom and leads to a wealth of new phenomena .",
    "the topic has been already reviewed in a number of works  @xcite and the first experimental results on cavity arrays are beginning to appear  @xcite .",
    "very recently a dissipation - driven phase transition in a coupled cavity dimer has been reported  @xcite which paves to similar studies on larger arrays .",
    "cavity arrays are periodic arrangements of qed - cavities aimed at studying many - body states with photons . in their first conception  @xcite , as well as in most of the subsequent papers on the topic , the coupling between neighboring cavities has been mediated by photon hopping . indeed it was envisaged , and confirmed by an extensive number of works , that a very rich phenomenology arises from the interplay between hopping and strong local nonlinearities leading to photon blockade  @xcite .    as long as particle losses can be ignored ,",
    "the properties of cavity arrays resemble in several aspects those of the bose - hubbard model  @xcite . in the photon - blockade regime",
    "the cavity array enters a mott phase , in which photon number fluctuations are suppressed . on the contrary ,",
    "when the hopping between neighboring cavities dominates over the local nonlinearities , photons are delocalized through the whole array . in the absence of leakage , photon number",
    "is conserved and this phase has long - range superfluid correlations .",
    "some care with the definition of superfluidity in photonic systems has to be taken in the ( more realistic ) case where leakage is present .",
    "a discussion of this issue has just been started for the case of cavity arrays  @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for an analysis in related systems .",
    "the `` equilibrium '' phase diagram of coupled cavity arrays has been thoroughly studied and the location of the different phases , together with the critical properties of the associated phase transitions , have been determined ( a fairly complete review of our present understanding can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) .",
    "cavity arrays , however , naturally operate under nonequilibrium conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , subject to unavoidable leakage of photons which are pumped back into the system by an external drive . in that case , the situation may change drastically , and it is to a large extent an unexplored territory . only very recently",
    "the many - body nonequilibrium dynamics of cavity arrays started to be addressed ",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein  thus entering the exciting field of quantum phases and phase transitions in driven quantum open systems  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we further pursue this direction and study the steady - state properties of a cavity array in the presence of photon leakage and subject to an external uniform coherent drive .",
    "the additional new ingredient we introduce is a cavity coupling through nonlinear elements .",
    "so far , with some notable exceptions  @xcite , the coupling between cavities has been considered only through photon hopping .",
    "implementations based on circuit - qed  @xcite however provide enough flexibility to connect two neighboring cavities both via linear ( _ e.g. _  capacitors ) and nonlinear ( _ e.g. _  josephson nano - circuits ) elements .",
    "this freedom paves the way to explore a multitude of different engineered hamiltonians with systems of cavities . at this point",
    ", it is also worth to stress that the implementation of cavity arrays within circuit - qed is very promising , the first experiments with arrays of up to five cavities have been done  @xcite , and experiments with lattices of cavities are progressing fast  @xcite .    in the present paper we expand on the results discussed in ref .",
    "we will give a more detailed account on the steady - state phase diagram .",
    "most of the analysis will be performed by means of a single - site mean - field decoupling .",
    "we will further check the robustness of our results by performing a cluster mean - field analysis to take into account the effect of short - range quantum fluctuations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section  [ model ]",
    "we define the model and its dynamics , dictated by both the unitary evolution ( which includes the external drive ) and the dissipation . in section  [ meanfield ] we introduce the mean - field approximation which will then be used to extract the steady - state phase diagram , extensively described in section  [ diagram ] . in section  [ clusterm ]",
    "we include the effect of short - range correlations by performing a cluster mean - field analysis .",
    "we conclude by discussing in section  [ cqed ] some specific aspects of the implementation with circuit - qed cavities .",
    "a summary of our results is given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the model we will investigate , including an external coherent drive , is described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath0 } - j\\sum_{\\langle i , j \\rangle}{(a_i^\\dagger a_j + \\text{h.c.})}\\nonumber \\\\    & & + u\\sum_{i}{n_i(n_i-1 ) } + v \\sum_{\\langle i , j \\rangle}{n_in_{j}}\\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\sum_{\\langle i , j \\rangle}{\\left[\\frac{j_2}{2 } a_i^\\dagger a_i^\\dagger a_j a_j        - j_n a_i^\\dagger ( n_i+n_j ) a_j + \\text{h.c . } \\right ] } \\ ; ,    \\label{modelham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the rotating frame with respect to the frequency of the external drive . the number operator @xmath1 counts the photons in the @xmath2-th cavity , @xmath3 is the detuning of the cavity mode with respect to the frequency of the pump , and @xmath4 is the amplitude of the coherent pumping .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath5 is the standard rate for the hopping of individual photons between neighboring cavities .",
    "the two contributions in the second line take into account the effective ( kerr ) interaction between the photons : @xmath6 quantifies the onsite repulsion , while @xmath7 is the cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "the remaining terms describe correlated photon hopping .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath8 is responsible for the pair hopping and the term proportional to @xmath9 describes the hopping to a neighboring cavity controlled by the occupation of that cavity .",
    "the brackets @xmath10 indicate that the sum is restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "in addition to the unitary part , there are losses due to photons leaking out of the cavities .",
    "the dynamics of the density matrix @xmath11 of the system is then governed by the master equation @xmath12+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\sum_i{(2a_i\\rho a_i^\\dagger - n_i\\rho-\\rho n_i ) } \\ , ,    \\label{mastereq}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the photon lifetime .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath14 , and work in units of @xmath15 .",
    "solving exactly the dynamics dictated by eq .   is a formidable task .",
    "here we study the steady - state phase diagram by employing a mean - field decoupling , which should become accurate in the limit of arrays with large coordination number @xmath16 .",
    "there are several terms in the hamiltonian that involve couplings between different sites : besides the hopping , including single- , two - photon and correlated hopping , one also has to take into account the cross - kerr term .",
    "indeed the latter contribution ( controlled by @xmath7 ) may favour the stabilization of a _ photon crystal _ phase , in which the photon blockade is density modulated  @xcite . in order to include this possibility",
    ", the decoupling should be different for different sublattices .",
    "let us consider a bipartite lattice : indicating with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the corresponding sublattices , the different terms are decoupled as follows : @xmath19 after the decoupling , the density matrix of the array can be written as @xmath20 .",
    "moreover in each sublattice the system can be considered as uniform .",
    "the dynamics is thus reduced to two coupled equations for the density matrices of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 sublattices , respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(2a_a\\rho_a a_a^\\dagger - n_a\\rho_a-\\rho_a n_a),\\label{twositesmaster1}\\\\    \\dot{\\rho}_b&=&-i[\\mathcal{h}_b,\\rho_b]+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(2a_b\\rho_b a_b^\\dagger - n_b\\rho_b-\\rho_b n_b),\\label{twositesmaster2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "a difference in the average photon population of the two sublattices , @xmath30 , signals a crystalline phase in which the @xmath17-@xmath18 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "this quantity can be used as an order parameter . on the contrary",
    ", an average @xmath31 or @xmath32 ( or equivalently @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) different from zero can not be associated to any superfluid ordering in the steady state . in this sense",
    "the situation is very different from the `` equilibrium '' scenario ( neither damping nor driving ) . due to the external coherent driving",
    ", there is no spontaneous breaking of the @xmath35 gauge symmetry .",
    "the external drive induces a global coherence , that is not at all related to the collective behavior of the cavity array . for an incoherent pumping , in contrast , spontaneous coherence can be found but does not lead to a non - vanishing expectation value @xmath36 for the field ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    related to this last point",
    ", it is worth commenting on the correlated hopping appearing in the last line of eq .  :",
    "the corresponding decoupling is given in the last three lines of the mean - field approximation , eq .  .",
    "in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the presence of these contributions in the hamiltonian may considerably enrich the phase diagram . in the present context",
    "however they will not play a major role . in the physical implementation we consider , the associated coupling constants @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 are parametrically smaller then the single - photon hopping .",
    "we will mostly analyze regions of the phase diagram where @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , as we will see , they will lead only to some quantitative modifications of the phase boundaries .",
    "this is not however a fundamental issue : in circuit - qed implementations for example , it is possible to fine tune the values of the circuit elements in order to suppress the single - photon hopping in favor of the correlated one .",
    "concerning the comparison with the cross - kerr term , it is not difficult to imagine josephson circuits that will lead to an enhancement of the correlated hopping .",
    "there is however a second reason why the results of ref .",
    "@xcite can not be directly applied here .",
    "it is again related to the fact that under nonequilibrium conditions , as we analyze here , coherence is built up because of the external drive .",
    "it would be very interesting to explore in this context situations where superfluidity in cavity arrays arises spontaneously  @xcite .",
    "in such circumstances , nonlinear couplings that introduce correlated hoppings could lead to very interesting photon - pair superfluidity .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the properties of the steady - state phase diagram by solving eqs .  - for various choices of the couplings .",
    "the phase diagram derived from eqs .  - is quite rich .",
    "a first account of this was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we extend the analysis and provide some more detailed discussions .",
    "due to the cross - kerr nonlinearity , the steady - state phases can be classified into uniform and checkerboard phases .",
    "this is a general feature of the exact model and it is captured in the mean - field approximation by introducing a decoupling which takes into account different averages on different sublattices . as already mentioned , these two phases can be distinguished by the order parameter @xmath38 .",
    "here we refer only to the steady state , therefore the value of @xmath39 is time - independent , unless stated otherwise ( see below ) . in the uniform phase ,",
    "the steady - state photon population in the two sublattices is identical , which means a vanishing @xmath39 . in checkerboard ( crystalline )",
    "phase the photon number in the cavity array is modulated as in a photon crystal .",
    "the photon population of one sublattice is higher than that of the other one , which means a non - zero @xmath39 . yet , this is not the whole story .    for some values of the coupling constants , the observables can never be time - independent even in the long - time limit . instead",
    ", the system will enter an oscillatory phase in which the photon number of each sublattice oscillates periodically with @xmath40 .",
    "the steady state can further show bistable behavior and dependence of the initial conditions .",
    "all of this can occur both in the uniform and in the crystalline phases .",
    "the richness of the steady - state phase diagram arises due to all these combinations which can appear . in order to simplify the presentation ,",
    "the discussion has been organized in different sections , for various classes of values of the couplings . in the following we choose different values of the couplings as compared to  @xcite .",
    "when not specified , the correlated hopping terms are set to zero .      in the limit @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we recover the model studied by lee _",
    "et al . _",
    "in fact , when @xmath6 represents the largest energy scale in the problem , our phase diagram coincides with that of ref .",
    "note however that , differently from what is usually encountered in other systems with extended hubbard - like interaction , for circuit - qed implementations as discussed in section  [ cqed ] , the case in which @xmath45 makes sense as well .",
    "as long as the onsite repulsion @xmath6 is much larger than the other energy scales ( except possibly of @xmath7 ) it is always possible to reduce the local hilbert space to only two states and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite apply .",
    "the situation in which both the onsite interaction and the correlated hopping vanish ( @xmath47 ) can be solved exactly , within the mean - field approximation .",
    "the coupled master equations in eqs .  - can be rewritten in the form of complex differential equations as follows , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath51 [ _ i.e. _  @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we focus on the fixed points of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath54 , the non - uniform fixed points are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are two different real roots of the quadratic equation @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the non - uniform fixed points exist only when @xmath7 satisfies the condition , @xmath60 on the other side , the uniform fixed points are given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is any possible positive real root of the equation @xmath63 since eq .",
    "is a cubic equation in @xmath64 , the number of positive real roots can be determined by descartes rule of signs .",
    "we see that for @xmath65 there is only one uniform fixed point and for @xmath66 there might be one or three uniform fixed points .",
    "furthermore , if there exist three uniform fixed points , the polynomial corresponding to eq .   should have a positive local maximum and a negative local minimum .",
    "thus there are three uniform fixed points if and only if @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the stability of the fixed points should be analyzed as well .",
    "if all the eigenvalues have negative real parts , the fixed point is stable .",
    "if all the eigenvalues have negative real parts except for a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues , a hopf bifurcation appears , thus we can expect to see a limit circle from the system .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 can be controlled through the external driving and are the easiest to be tuned in experiments ( within the same array ) .",
    "we thus start our discussion of the phase diagram as a function of these two parameters .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_u0 ] .",
    "here and in the next figures , we use the following notation : `` uni '' stands for uniform , `` cry '' for crystalline , `` osc '' for oscillatory , ``  /  '' denotes a bistability . a vanishing @xmath39 indicates the normal , uniform phase , while a non - zero @xmath39 signals the crystalline phase in which the photon number is modulated as in a photon crystal .",
    "note that there is an oscillatory phase in the region @xmath69 and @xmath70 , due to the appearance of a hopf bifurcation with increasing pumping amplitude . in this phase",
    "the system state will never become completely stationary and , in the long - time limit , the trace of @xmath71 with @xmath72 is a limit circle .",
    "since , in our case , the hopf bifurcation appears and disappears only for non - uniform fixed points , @xmath39 will be different from zero in the oscillatory phase .",
    "a further investigation of the reduced density matrix of the sublattice ( either a or b ) shows that the system is in a coherent state ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : wigner ] and  [ sec : squeezing ] for more details ) .",
    "the oscillatory phase also extends to finite values of @xmath6 , although the coherent state is progressively deformed on increasing the onsite repulsion .",
    "the contemporary presence of checkerboard ordering and global dynamical phase coherence suggested us to view this phase as a nonequilibrium supersolid phase  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us also point out that two additional regions , indicated with `` uni / osc '' and `` uni / cry '' , are present in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_u0 ] . for the parameter values in these regions ,",
    "the steady state does depend on the initial values of the density matrix .",
    "this indicates that the system is bistable .      in the case of @xmath73",
    ", it is possible to find the roots of eq .   and check the stability of the fixed points numerically .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of the hopping strength @xmath5 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_j>0 ] , panel ( a ) , where we observe that the hopping delocalizes photons and favors the uniform phase .",
    "together with the quench of the crystalline phase , finite values of @xmath5 hopping may facilitate a crystalline order , thus leading to a reentrance in the phase diagram [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "a qualitatively similar feature can be also seen in the @xmath74 plane , as shown in panel ( c ) . at this stage",
    "there is no simple explanation for the reentrance .",
    "the fact that the hopping may stabilise the crystalline phase indicates that quantum fluctuations are important .",
    "moreover we would like to stress that the reentrance might also appear as a peculiarity of the mean - field approximation .",
    "the effect of a finite correlated and pair hopping ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_j2>0 ] . for simplicity",
    "we chose @xmath77 ( changing this ratio introduces only quantitative differences ) .",
    "as for the nearest - neighbor hopping , pair hopping generally increases the extension of the uniform phase .",
    "in particular , compare the upper panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_j2>0 ] with the corresponding panel ( b ) in fig  [ fig : phase_j>0 ] , where we observe that , for larger values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the colored region shrinks and shifts towards smaller @xmath3 values .",
    "apart from some quantitative modifications , however the shape of the phase diagram is not modified , thus confirming what has been anticipated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_j2>0 ] , the effect of the correlated / pair hopping is further analyzed .",
    "it is evident that , for very small values , a non - zero value of @xmath8 contributes to stabilize the crystal phase . in this regime ,",
    "the crystalline phase is already quenched by quantum fluctuations and correlated hopping may be an efficient means to homogenize those configurations with higher occupation that do not contribute to the order . eventually continuing to increase @xmath8",
    ", there is a transition back to a homogeneous phase .",
    "the same effect is also seen in panel ( d ) , where the different curves are parametrized by the detuning .      in the case in which the onsite repulsion is taken into account ,",
    "the mean - field equations have to be solved numerically .",
    "the results for different values of @xmath7 and non - zero onsite repulsion are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : finiteu ] , in the limit of zero photon hopping .",
    "the cross - kerr nonlinearity @xmath7 tends to extend the crystalline phase . for some intermediate value of @xmath4 and @xmath3",
    ", an oscillatory phase emerges . however due to the onsite nonlinearity the reduced density matrix of the sublattice @xmath17 or @xmath18 is not coherent any more .",
    "we will discuss this issue further in the remaining part of the paper .      as we already mentioned , there are regions of the steady - state phase diagram where the system shows a limit circle or a bistable behavior .",
    "let us have a closer look at these cases . here",
    "we will mostly concentrate on the case in which the onsite nonlinearity is present , since the limit @xmath79 was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rectangular panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : wigner ] display the time evolution of the photon number @xmath80 in each sublattice , in the small-@xmath6 and in the large-@xmath6 regime .",
    "we address directly the long - time limit , where we ensured that the system has already reached the asymptotic state ( this does not depend on the choice of the initial conditions ) . in the square panels we show the corresponding wigner functions of the two sublattices ( a on the left , b on the right ) .",
    "they are defined as @xmath81 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 being an eigenstate of the position operator @xmath85 and @xmath86 being the reduced density matrix of sublattice a or b.    for small onsite nonlinearity @xmath6 ( three upper panels ) , the system evolves periodically in time and the asymptotic state is a limit circle . compared with the limiting case of @xmath79 , the coherence of each sublattice",
    "is drastically modified due to the presence of the onsite repulsion .",
    "this can be seen from the wigner function of each sublattice : it is clear that the distributions in phase space deviate from the gaussian shape , especially for the sublattice with higher photon number .",
    "furthermore , on increasing the interaction strength , coherence is progressively weaker and correspondingly synchronization is suppressed . for the oscillatory regions at large @xmath6 ( three bottom panels ) ,",
    "the wigner function of the sublattice with higher photon number may resemble a two - hole ringlike shape , which means that the phase of the motion is undetermined . on the contrary , for small @xmath6 the system",
    "is still synchronized , albeit not perfectly because there may be a ( small ) error in the determination of the phase .",
    "also in the presence of correlated hopping ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wigner2 ] ) , oscillatory phases do appear .",
    "from eq .  , we see that the pair hopping is likely to introduce a squeezing effect to the mode of each sublattice in which the uncertainty of one variable is reduced by sacrificing the certainty of the conjugate one . in order to see the squeezing properties of the system ,",
    "we may write the annihilation operator @xmath87 as a linear combination of two hermitian operators , @xmath88 with the operators @xmath89 and @xmath90 obeying @xmath91 = 2i$ ] . the corresponding uncertainty relation is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) . for a coherent state",
    "we always have @xmath95 , while for a squeezed state @xmath96 , so that the uncertainty of one quadrature is reduced at the expense of increasing the uncertainty of the other one .",
    "it is therefore tempting to associate the different regions of the phase diagram to different squeezing behavior .    looking carefully at the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : wigner2 ] , we note that , for our choice of the parameters , sublattice b ( dashed lines ) is always squeezed . on the other hand , the squeezing property of sublattice a ( continuous lines ) is time - dependent .",
    "the bottom panels display the wigner functions at the moment in which both sublattices are squeezed .",
    "a further example of the squeezing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezing ] , where we analyzed its behavior in the @xmath5-@xmath8 parameter space , in absence of the onsite interaction , @xmath79 .",
    "the squeezing properties can be divided into three regions . in the black region both of the two sublattices are squeezed , in the gray region only one sublattice is squeezed , and in the white region no sublattice is squeezed . a more detailed analysis based on the variance",
    "is shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "the single - site mean - field approximation ignores all quantum correlations between the subsystems  @xcite . in order to get a flavor of the role of correlations , we employ a ( more demanding ) cluster mean - field approach . in this case ,",
    "short range correlations within the cluster are treated exactly , while the mean field is defined at the boundary of the cluster itself .",
    "our hope is to have more accurate information on the phase diagram , because short range correlations are preserved .",
    "we divide the lattice into clusters composed of four sites ( clockwise labelling the sites by 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . without loss of generality , we identify the sites with odd ( even ) numbers with sublattices @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . for the sake of clarity ,",

    "it can be seen that in the cluster mean - field case , the crystalline phase is reduced . for small values of @xmath6",
    "the discrepancy between the two approaches is tiny , but it increases for larger @xmath6 . in the hard - core limit ( @xmath106 ) the critical point obtained in the cluster mean - field approximation , @xmath107 , is about twice larger than that in the mean - field approximation , @xmath108 .",

    "the other terms come from the nonlinearities @xmath129 .",
    "in particular , @xmath140 takes into account the onsite contribution ( cavity frequency and onsite kerr terms respectively ) , @xmath141 describes a cross - kerr nonlinearity , and the term @xmath142 is a correlated hopping of photons between neighboring sites .",
    "each nonlinear coupling contributes with a cross - kerr nonlinearity and an onsite kerr nonlinearity , where the cross - kerr term is twice as strong as the onsite kerr term .",
    "for the model of two sites with one nonlinear link that we analyze here , the cross - kerr nonlinearity is thus twice as large as the onsite kerr nonlinearity .",
    "more generally , for any lattice coordination number @xmath16 , the sum of all cross - kerr nonlinearities connected to a lattice site is always twice as large as the total onsite kerr nonlinearity on the lattice site .",
    "this ratio can be however modified by introducing further onsite nonlinearities , via additional superconducting qubits that locally couple to the resonators .",
    "in our study we focus on models where interactions are short ranged , so that only neighboring lattice sites are coupled . to ensure that interactions decay sufficiently fast for this approximation to hold , we require that @xmath143 [ this approximation has been used in deriving eq .  ] . nonetheless the cross - kerr interaction in @xmath141 , even for @xmath144 ( which , for @xmath143 , implies @xmath145 ) can be much larger than photon losses , @xmath146 , since , _ e.g. _ , transmon qubits have @xmath147ghz and @xmath148s  @xcite .",
    "note that the josephson junctions that link two neighboring oscillators can be built tunable by replacing them with a dc - squid . in this way the @xmath149 and",
    "thus the @xmath150 can be modulated by applying an external flux to the dc - squids and the hamiltonian   can be tuned in real time .",
    "hence , by choosing the external flux such that @xmath151 , a linear tunneling of photons between the resonators can be switched on .",
    "the hamiltonian derived here has the same structure as in eq .  .",
    "the main difference is that not all the coupling constants are independent .",
    "moreover for this particular implementation both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are negative . in the driven - dissipative setting we consider here , this however does not significantly affect the phase diagrams . in ground state phase diagrams ,",
    "the configurations with lowest energies are favoured and the sign of interactions matters .",
    "in contrast , in the driven - dissipative scenario , the drive frequency selects a preferred energy and interactions tend to drive the system away from that preferred energy , either to lower or higher energies .",
    "hence configurations leading to significant interaction energies are avoided irrespective of the sign of the interaction .",

    "we focused on the role of cross - kerr nonlinearities . extending the results of ref .",

    "nonlinear circuits coupling neighboring resonators would suffice .",
    "we verified that the crystalline phase survives the presence of local quantum fluctuations by extending our analysis to a cluster mean - field .",
