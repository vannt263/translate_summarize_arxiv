    "in our previous monte carlo ( mc ) studies of the classical xy - model on sierpi ' nski gasket with @xmath1 1.585  @xcite , and on sierpi ' nski pyramid with fractal dimension @xmath2  @xcite , we observed the absence of any finite temperature phase transition .",
    "these fractal lattices both have a finite minimum order of ramification , @xmath3 .",
    "the sierpi ' nski pyramid has @xmath4 4 , while sierpi ' nski gasket has @xmath4 3 .",
    "the order of ramification @xmath5 at a point p of a lattice is the number of significant bonds one must break to isolate an arbitrarily large cluster of points surrounding p from the rest of the lattice .",
    "regular , translationally invariant systems , which fill space uniformly , have infinite order of ramification .",
    "in contrast , fractals , which are by definition scale invariant but not translationally invariant , do not fill space uniformly and may have a finite order of ramification . in fractals with finite @xmath5 , any cluster of points can be cut off from the rest of the structure by breaking only a finite number of bonds .",
    "consequently , thermal fluctuations in these systems are sufficient to destroy the long range order associated with continuous phase transitions , as well as the quasi - long range order associated with the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition , exhibited by the xy - model in translationally invariant two - dimensional systems .",
    "this behavior is independent of the microscopic model and has been observed for spin models with discrete symmetry ( ising model , discrete @xmath6 symmetry )  @xcite as well as models with continuous symmetry ( xy - model , continuous @xmath7(2 ) symmetry )  @xcite .",
    "gefen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite briefly explored the critical behavior of magnetic models with continuous @xmath8 symmetry , @xmath9 2 , on a class of sierpi ' nski carpets , which are two - dimensional analogues of menger sponge , and are infinitely ramified .",
    "they used a correspondence between electrical properties of a pure resistor network connecting the sites of a lattice and the low - temperature properties of such magnetic models on the same lattice .",
    "they established the absence of long range order at finite temperatures in the continuous spin models on fractal structures with @xmath10 2 , even in the case of an infinite @xmath5 .",
    "they speculated that this absence of long range order could be attributed to the fact that the lower critical dimension for spin models with continuous @xmath8 symmetry on regular lattices is @xmath11 2 .",
    "they remarked that the @xmath8-model should be examined on fractals with @xmath12 and @xmath13 2 .",
    "recently , we have examined the classical xy - model on a sierpi ' nski carpet  @xcite , which is a fractal with @xmath12 and @xmath1 1.8928 , and we found no finite - temperature bkt transition to quasi - long - range order , in agreement with the conjecture of gefen _ et al . _    here",
    "we examine the classical xy - model on a three - dimensional menger sponge ( ms ) , figure  [ fig : sponge1 ] , which is a fractal structure that has both an infinite @xmath5 and fractal dimension @xmath13 2 .",
    "the fractal dimension of ms is obtained from the scaling procedure which is used to construct it .",
    "one direct iterative process to generate ms begins with the first order ( @xmath14 1 ) ms shown in figure  [ fig : sponge1 ] , which is obtained by removing from the 2@xmath152@xmath152 structure the central sites of the six faces and the central site with coordinates ( 1,1,1 ) . the second order ( @xmath14 2 ) ms",
    "is then created by translating the first order sponge with 20 translation vectors , which are obtained by multiplying the position vectors of the 20 sites of the first order sponge by a factor of 3 .",
    "the third order ( @xmath14 3 ) ms is obtained by translating the second order sponge with 20 translation vectors which are obtained by increasing the length of the previous set of translation vectors by a factor of 3 , etc . each iteration in this process produces a structure with 20 times more sites than the previous one and with the edge which is three times longer than the edge of the previous structure . from the definition of the fractal dimension @xmath16number of self - similar pieces@xmath17magnification factor@xmath18 one finds @xmath1620@xmath193@xmath20 2.7268 for the ms .",
    "1.,width=151 ]    similar to a cubic lattice ( @xmath12 ) , the number of bonds that must be cut to isolate an arbitrarily large cluster of points from the rest of the ms grows as a power of the linear size of the system .",
    "consequently , the ms has an infinite order of ramification .",
    "since ms is a fractal object , it is scale invariant but not translationally invariant .",
    "the deviation from translational symmetry , as well as the degree of inhomogeneity in the lattice , is measured by the lacunarity @xmath21 .",
    "we used a procedure introduced by gefen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to estimate the lacunarity of our fractal , and found it to be @xmath22 0.19204  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describing our system is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 0 is the coupling constant , @xmath25 denotes the nearest neighbors , and 0 @xmath26 2@xmath27 is the angle variable on site @xmath28 .",
    "we applied the wolff cluster algorithm  @xcite to perform a monte carlo study of eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) on ms of several sizes . in our simulations , we computed the heat capacity , magnetic susceptibility , and helicity modulus for ms of order @xmath14 14 ( the number of sites in a sponge of order @xmath29 is @xmath30 ) .",
    "the dependence of the helicity modulus on the boundary conditions and on system size indicates no finite temperature transition , despite the fact that ms is infinitely ramified and its fractal dimension exceeds the lower critical dimension of the xy - model .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ procedure ]",
    "we present our numerical procedure used in calculations . in section  [ results ]",
    "we discuss our results , and summarize our findings in section  [ summary ] .",
    "one procedure for obtaining the ms of order @xmath29 was described in the introduction : the sponge of order @xmath29 is generated by translating the sponge of order @xmath31 1@xmath18 with 20 translation vectors which are obtained by multiplying the position vectors of the 20 points in the @xmath14 1 sponge , shown in figure 1 , by a factor of 3@xmath32 .",
    "the xy - model described by eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) takes into account only the nearest neighbor interactions , and it is necessary to provide a list of nearest neighbors for each spin on the lattice . by construction of the ms ,",
    "two sites are nearest neighbors if their distance is equal to 1 .",
    "it is important to note that since the ms is a fractal object and does not fill space uniformly , the average coordination number varies from one order to another .",
    "the sponges of order @xmath14 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 have average coordination numbers 2.400 , 3.360 , 3.744 , 3.898 , and 3.959 , respectively , with standard deviations 0.4899 , 0.9113 , 1.0181 , 1.0532 , and 1.0659 , respectively . because of the cubic symmetry of the system , the upper bound on the number of nearest neighbors for any point in the ms is equal to the coordination number of a simple cubic lattice",
    ".    since the fractals lack translational symmetry , we could not employ periodic boundary conditions .",
    "instead we used only the closed boundary condition ( cbc ) and open ( or free ) boundary condition ( obc ) .",
    "for the closed boundary condition , each of the eight outer corners of the sponge of order @xmath29 is coupled to the three closest outer corners , which are located a distance of 3@xmath33 - 1 away . for the open boundary condition ,",
    "the eight outer corners of the sponge are not coupled to each other .    in our simulations",
    "we used the wolff cluster monte carlo algorithm  @xcite because it reduces the problems associated with the critical slowing down observed in the vicinity of a phase transition due to its non - local update scheme . in the wolff cluster algorithm one",
    "starts building a cluster from a randomly chosen site @xmath28 in the lattice / sponge . at the same time one picks a randomly chosen axis through the origin of the two - dimensional classical planar spin space .",
    "all neighboring sites @xmath34 of @xmath28 are visited and these sites join the cluster with the probability @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the component of the spin on site @xmath28 which is perpendicular to the chosen axis , @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath38 is the absolute temperature .",
    "subsequently , one visits the neighbors @xmath39 of the new sites in the cluster , adding them to the cluster with probability @xmath40 unless they are already in the cluster .",
    "this process is repeated until no new sites enter the cluster , at which point one flips the sign of all @xmath41 in the cluster , i.e. all spins in the cluster are mirror - reflected in the chosen axis .",
    "this completes one monte carlo ( mc ) step in the wolff algorithm and is analogous to a random change of angle of a single planar spin in the metropolis mc algorithm  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) that the average size of clusters of correlated spins increases with decreasing temperature and could approach the system size at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "hence , the computing time at low temperatures rapidly increases with increasing order of the ms , and we considered only the sponges of order @xmath42 4 .    for sponges of order",
    "@xmath42 3 the simulations typically started at low temperatures and the initial configuration was a `` cold '' start , such that the system was in its lowest energy state with all the spins aligned .",
    "the final configuration at a given temperature was used as the initial configuration for the next higher temperature .",
    "for each temperature , we discarded the first 120,000 mc steps ( clusters ) to allow the system to equilibrate .",
    "an additional 7 links , each of 120,000 mc steps , was then generated at each temperature .",
    "to get an estimate of the error , we broke each of the 7 links into blocks of 20,000 mc steps .",
    "then the average value was calculated for each of these 42 blocks , and the standard deviation of these 42 averages was used as an estimate of the error .    the largest sponge ( @xmath14 4 with 160,000 sites ) was an exception to this procedure .",
    "seven links of 120,000 mc steps per temperature required more than a month of computing time per temperature for @xmath43 1.06 . for the largest sponge we started at the highest temperature @xmath44 1.4 using a `` hot '' start , with the spins randomized and the final configuration was used as the initial configuration for the next lower temperature . as in the case of smaller sponges ( @xmath45 4 ) , the first 120,000 mc steps ( clusters ) were discarded and additional 7 links , each of 120,000 mc steps , were generated at each temperature .",
    "the lowest temperature at which the data were obtained in this way was @xmath44 1.06 , and the corresponding cpu time was one month .",
    "we obtained an additional set of data at @xmath44 0.8 by reducing the size of link from 120,000 mc steps to 30,000 mc steps per link and it took three weeks of cpu time to complete the simulation .",
    "the heat capacity per site was calculated using the fluctuations in internal energy @xmath46 and the linear magnetic susceptibility per site @xmath47 was calculated from fluctuations in magnetization per site ( @xmath29 ) as @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the mc average .",
    "the helicity modulus for the ms was calculated using the method of shih , ebner and stroud  @xcite which we used in our previous work  @xcite . in this scheme , the xy hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ eqn1 ] ) )",
    "is thought of as describing a set of josephson - coupled superconducting grains in zero magnetic field .",
    "@xmath50 , the direction of spin for each lattice site @xmath28 , becomes the phase of the superconducting order parameter for that particular site . applying a uniform vector potential @xmath51 causes a shift in the phase difference @xmath52 of the xy hamiltonian by the amount @xmath53 . in this expression",
    ", @xmath54 is the position vector of site @xmath28 , and @xmath55 is the flux quantum .",
    "the helicity modulus is then obtained from the second derivative of the helmholtz free energy per site with respect to uniform @xmath51 , at @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting expression for @xmath57 is @xmath58\\>,\\ ] ] with h the phase - shifted xy hamiltonian .",
    "the vector potential was applied along one of the cube edges of the ms ( e.g. x - axis ) , which amounted to contributions to @xmath57 only from nearest neighbors whose x - coordinates differ by @xmath59 because of the cubic symmetry of the ms .",
    "our results for the specific heat are shown in figure  [ fig : cv ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : cvmax ] we show the dependence of the maximum in the specific heat @xmath60 obtained with the open boundary condition on the system size .",
    "the data were fitted by the formula @xmath61 and we obtained @xmath62 1.36 , @xmath63 -1.35 , and @xmath64 1.01 , with the @xmath65 of the fit equal to 2.03@xmath1510@xmath66 .",
    "thus the maximum in the specific heat of the ms saturates in the thermodynamic limit at a value that is not much higher than what we obtained for our largest cluster ( @xmath67 1.250 @xmath68 0.106 for @xmath69 160,000 ) .",
    "the menger sponge is a structure in three dimensional space but the average coordination number is @xmath70 4 and is in the range characteristic of a two - dimensional system .",
    "the specific heat exponent @xmath71 is not accurately known for the classical xy - model on periodic lattices in @xmath11 3 .",
    "the high - temperature series expansions give @xmath72 -0.02 @xmath68 0.03   @xcite and @xmath72 0.02 @xmath68 0.02  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results derived from @xmath73 measurements  @xcite and from the thermal expansion coefficient measurements  @xcite near the superfluid transition of @xmath74he give @xmath72 -0.02 @xmath68 0.02 and @xmath72 -0.026 @xmath68 0.004 , respectively .",
    "le guillou and zinn - justin  @xcite have obtained @xmath72 -0.007 @xmath68 0.006 using field - theoretical methods .",
    "these results seem to favor a small but negative @xmath71 in which case there is a sharp cusp in the specific heat for an infinite system , and in numerical simulations the specific heat would saturate with increasing system size . on the other hand , the classical xy - model on periodic lattices     3 menger sponge ( @xmath69 8,000 sites ) obtained with closed boundary condition",
    "are not shown for the sake of clarity since they overlap with the results obtained with open boundary condition.,width=302 ]        in @xmath11 2 leads to berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition associated with unbinding of topological defects ( vortices and antivortices ) , and the specific heat has an unobservable essential singularity at the transition temperature   @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo simulations  @xcite give a peak in the specific heat above the bkt transition temperature .",
    "the peak is caused by unbinding of vortex clusters  @xcite and its size saturates in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that kohring _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite presented monte carlo evidence that a continuous phase transition for the classical xy - model on periodic lattices in @xmath11 3 is related to unbinding of vortex strings and that the topological defects of this model on the menger sponge are , in principle , vortex strings in addition to vortices in planes parallel to the faces of the sponge . in our numerical work we did not keep track of topological defects since we did not have an a priori reason to assume that there is a phase transition for the xy - model on the ms .",
    "however , if there is no phase transition for the xy - model on ms , as we eventually conclude based on the data for the helicity modulus , the peak in the specific heat could result from the average energy per site @xmath75 changing monotonically from a value slightly higher than -2j ( the average coordination number is slightly less than 4 ) at low temperatures to near zero in disordered paramagnetic phase at high temperatures .    in figure  [",
    "fig : chi ] we show our results for the linear susceptibility of the xy - model on the ms with different number of sites ( @xmath76 ) obtained with both types of boundary conditions . for the classical xy - model on a simple cubic lattice in @xmath11 3",
    "the linear susceptibility @xmath47 diverges at transition temperature @xmath77 of about 2.2  @xcite with the critical exponent @xmath78 1.316 @xmath68 0.0025  @xcite . in numerical simulations on finite cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions",
    "one gets a peak in @xmath47 near @xmath79 2.2 whose size and sharpness increase with the number of sites as a result of a diverging correlation length at the onset of long range order  @xcite .",
    "also , the position of the peak in @xmath47 shows a minute response to the system size , shifting to marginally lower temperatures as the size of the lattice is increased  @xcite . for the ms",
    "we find that the size of the peak in @xmath47 also increases with the system size , the position of the peak shifts to higher temperatures with increasing system size with the open boundary condition , and with the closed boundary condition the position of the peak does not change much with the system size for @xmath80 400 .",
    "we note that for the cluster with @xmath69 8,000 sites the results for @xmath47 do not depend        much on the boundary condition . for the largest cluster with @xmath69 160,000 sites",
    "our data at @xmath44 0.8 and above @xmath44 1.06 indicate that @xmath47 has a maximum between these two temperatures , not far from @xmath44 0.95 , which is the position of the peak in @xmath47 for the sponge with @xmath69 8,000 sites .",
    "we note that for the classical xy - model on a square lattice , where the theory  @xcite predicts diverging susceptibility @xmath47 above the bkt transition temperature and an infinite @xmath47 below the transition temperature , mc simulations give a peak in @xmath47 above the transition temperature whose position is much more sensitive to the system size  @xcite than in the three - dimensional case . in our work on the xy - model on fractal lattices",
    "sierpi ' nski gasket  @xcite , sierpi ' nski pyramid  @xcite , and sierpi ' nski carpet  @xcite , which did not undergo finite temperature phase transition , we found the largest sensitivity in @xmath47 to the system size in terms of both peak height and peak position . therefore our results for the susceptibility in figure  [ fig : chi ] obtained with the closed boundary condition are not inconsistent with a putative continuous phase transition at finite temperature .    in our previous monte carlo work on the classical xy - model on fractal structures",

    "@xmath81 provides a measure of the response of a system to a twisting or helical strain at the boundary  @xcite .",
    "a finite resistance to this twist ( finite @xmath57 ) is expected for a system at zero temperature with all the spins aligned .",
    "conversely , in the high temperature paramagnetic phase with the spins randomized , this rigidity vanishes . in figure",
    "[ fig : helobc ] we show the helicity modulus @xmath81 calculated with the open boundary condition .",
    "we find that @xmath81 vanishes within the error bars for all ms which we considered ( @xmath14 14 ) . the open boundary condition led to vanishing helicity modulus for the xy - model on other fractal structures which we considered in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "that fact , together with the size dependence of the low - temperature @xmath81 obtained with the closed boundary condition , led us to the conclusion that there is no finite temperature phase transition in these systems .",
    "the results for the closed boundary condition are presented in figure  [ fig : helcbc ] . as in the cases of the xy - model on sierpi ' nski gaskets  @xcite , sierpi ' nski pyramids  @xcite , and sierpi ' nski carpets  @xcite , the closed boundary conditions lead to finite values of the low - temperature helicity modulus which decrease with increasing system size .",
    "one qualitative difference between the results in figure  [ fig : helcbc ] and those obtained previously is that for sierpi ' nski gaskets , sierpi ' nski pyramids , and the sierpi ' nski carpets the onset of the downturn in @xmath81 shifted to lower temperatures with increasing system size , but it consistently began around the universal @xmath82-line for all system sizes ( nelson and kosterlitz  @xcite predicted a universal jump in @xmath57 at the bkt transition temperature @xmath83 given by @xmath84 ) . in the present case , the onset of the downturn in @xmath57 appears to be unrelated to the @xmath82-line , occurring at much higher temperatures , and the onset does not shift substantially to lower temperatures with increasing sponge order .",
    "the continuous transition that occurs in the classical xy - model on regular three - dimensional systems is accompanied by power - law decay of @xmath57 in the vicinity of the transition temperature : @xmath85 with @xmath86  @xcite for cubic lattices .",
    "also , the low - temperature values of the helicity modulus do not depend on the system size  @xcite . in ms with the closed boundary condition",
    ", the helicity modulus appears to obey power law decay at temperatures below the temperature where it vanishes .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison ] shows a comparison of the thermodynamic quantities for the 8000-site sponge with closed boundary conditions .",
    "one can see that similar to cubic lattice , the heat capacity and susceptibility are peaking at roughly the same temperature where the helicity modulus vanishes .",
    "taken on their own these results would suggest that there is a putative continuous phase transition at finite temperature .    however , the low - temperature values of @xmath57 for ms depend on the system size . in figure",
    "[ fig : helfit ] we show the low temperature values of the helicity modulus @xmath87 as a function of the system size and the fit ( solid line ) according to the formula @xmath88 with @xmath89 -0.0045 , @xmath90 2.74 , and @xmath91 1.39 , and the @xmath65 of the fit of 2.07@xmath1510@xmath66 .",
    "these values imply that @xmath87 vanishes for @xmath69 6.4@xmath1510@xmath92 , which corresponds to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a fit where @xmath93 was set equal to 0 was equally good ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : helfit ] which overlaps with the solid line ) .",
    "that fit produced @xmath90 2.78 and @xmath91 1.41 , with @xmath65 of the fit of 5.72@xmath1510@xmath66 .",
    "these results show that the low - temperature value of the helicity modulus obtained with the closed boundary condition goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit @xmath94 .",
    "hence , we have established numerically that there is no finite temperature phase transition for the classical xy - model on ms .",
    "we should point out that we reproduced all of these results in simulations on the menger sponges of orders @xmath14 13 using the metropolis mc algorithm but with slightly larger error bars , except for the heat capacity at high temperatures beyond the maximum in @xmath95 , where the metropolis algorithm produced smaller error bars than the wolff algorithm .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo study of the classical xy - model on menger sponge , which has infinite order of ramification , fractal dimension @xmath96 , and lacunarity @xmath97 .",
    "the open boundary condition leads to zero helicity modulus at finite temperatures . with the closed boundary condition ,",
    "the low temperature values of @xmath57 are finite but decrease with increasing system size .",
    "these trends suggest that the closed boundary conditions introduce additional correlations compared to those present in the system with the open boundary condition . by performing the finite - size scaling of the low temperature value @xmath87 of the helicity modulus obtained with the closed boundary condition , we found @xmath98 0 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath94 .",
